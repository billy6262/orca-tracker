Orca Sightings for March 31, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Late reporting, but thought the zoomed shots might help with identifying the
Grays around Everett
Several gray whales (4-5?) moving around the south end of
Hat/Gedney Island
and around Possession Sound around

5:30-6pm
. Lots of spouts and several dives showing off backs and tales.

At about

12:12 PM
while on our way to
Hat/Gedney
my parents, myself and my aunt sighted two grey whales in the middle of the bay
between Hat/Gedney Island and Jetty Island
, they were too far me to take photos. We spotted another grey whale off in the distance towards Howarth Park. Later, at

1:40 PM
, while in our cabin I looked out to see two more adult greys swimming right past the dock in front of our cabin, on the western side of Hat/Gedney Island coming from the direction of Saratoga Passage. They appeared to be feeding on shrimp. We saw five in total.

We're watching the whales from
Maxwelton beach

By pure luck, and a tip from Elsa Leavitt, at
Maxwelton Beach
, So. Whidbey, a pod of
5-6 orcas
in a tight group came by for over an hour, at first just as puffs of white on the horizon, then getting closer and closer, until we could finally see their dorsal fins and eventually their backs, with binocs. They zig-zagged once a few miles away, then continued on south and out of sight after

5:30 pm
.

Elsa Leavitt called to report a pod of
5-6 orcas off Bush Pt

Thanks to Tom on BC Orca we saw
T049C and T124C
skulking along the shoreline east bound off of
East Sooke Park
in the
morning
.
In the afternoon while trying to reacquire them I spotted a group of
14 T's
east bound west of
Constance Bank
which turned out to be
T063, the T065's, the T036's, and the T099's
.

Mukilteo
and possession point.

We watched
a grey whale
feeding off the
south end of Whidbey
today, at about
4pm
. We had just rounded the buoy on the SE end of the island when we spotted it. It surfaced at least a dozen times in the same area, but no displays of flukes or fins. Watched it for at least 30 min from afar before sailing back towards Edmonds. Lovely treat!
