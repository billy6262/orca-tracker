============================================================

Entry 1:

*

K and L pods moving northbound off Destruction Island
on the

Entry 2:
and based on our observations of the tag attachment condition on 9 March it is likely this was due to detachment.

J pod
was spotted by Nick Templeman
off Campbell River at about
4:50 pm
. He left them all spread out, socializing, between Mittlenatch Island and Salmon Point! Spread in sub groups over 3 miles.
What a magical encounter....it has been over 12 years for me to see J Pod! When we first came on scene it took a while to get a handle on the whole scene. We had only seen 4-6 animals to start but once we settled in, realized we were looking at a huge spread, well over 2-3 miles. We witnessed lots of surface activity, some longer, foraging dives. Seems they were successful in the hunt for salmon as we witnessed lots of gull activity over them in the distance in spots where they were on the surface. Hopefully getting a well deserved Spring salmon or two! They stayed quite separated the whole time...in little sub groups, so we were not able to see or photograph everyone. There was much excitement at points, breaches, double breaches, a couple times was 6-8 in a row! Very happy whales. I was excited to learn that this was all of J pod as well once the photos went out, nice to see Granny doing well!
