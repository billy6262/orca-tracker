Spotted
whale about
9:30am at Sandy Point
, 122.375W 48.031N, moving South on surface, ebb tide at about 6 or 7 ft. We think it might have been Dubknuck gray whale #44, but we were observing from a distance ashore. Half hour later walked to tidelands and observed about a dozen fresh feeding pits, oval 3 ft by 6-8ft, spaced about 10 ft apart in a line parallel to beach. Shorebirds were actively feeding on debris, which consisted of worms and bits of small crabs.
