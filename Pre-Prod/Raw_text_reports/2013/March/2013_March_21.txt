Orca Sightings for March 21, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:45 -
Found some
Transient orca killer whales
today. Mom was teaching her calf to kill a porpoise
near Jones Island (between San Juan and Orcas islands)
. Can't believe it, a mother with two calfs and two big males... The young one killed a porpoise ten feet from the Natsilane, and splattered blood on the side of the boat! Awesome!

from the bluff just north of the
Maple Grove boat launch on the north end of Camano Island
