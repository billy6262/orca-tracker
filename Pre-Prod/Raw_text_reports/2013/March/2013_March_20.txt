Orca Sightings for March 20, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today I was on a whale watching boat which located
two gray whales
feeding along the shoreline toward the south of
East Point on Whidbey Island about
1:00 p.m
. We observed the whales for about 1/2 hour before the two moved out into deeper water and headed north. It was a great day despite turbulent waters.

March 20 update - from NOAA's NWFSC
Over the past two days K25 headed south along the Washington Coast. They were initially near the Juan de Fuca Canyon and moved south on the continental shelf and were approaching the Astoria Canyon (off the mouth of the Columbia River) this morning.
