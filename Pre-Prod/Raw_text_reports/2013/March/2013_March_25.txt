Orca Sightings for March 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
An article in the
Long Beach WA
Chinook Observer read: "LONG BEACH - Long Beach resident Ted Magnuson glanced out the window of his home north of The Breakers
a little before noon
Monday and saw something he'd never before seen: dorsal fins of a pod of orcas breaking through the waves just offshore." Magnuson said he got a good look through a spotting scope at
4-5 orcas
just beyond the breakers off Long Beach, among the crab pot bouys, headed slowly south.
