KING5 News: This
Grey Whale was spotted close to shore while feeding in Crescent Harbor on Whidbey Island
Tuesday evening. The whale drew a fairly large crowd at NAS Whidbey Island's Seaplane Base as it put on quite a show for service members and their families. The event lasted for over an hour as it stirred up the bottom silt and fed on the sea animals dislodged from the harbor floor.

Gray whales
galore
off Gedney (Hat) Island around
10:30 am
- first of all a trio, then two pairs. Maybe one of those decided to go shoreline as those of us on "Mystic Sea" watched while a single gray whale rolled close to shore waving pecs before - lo and behold - treating us to two spy-hops. Two people on the beach really had a bird's eye view... We heard, and saw, the heart-shaped blows of a couple of other gray whales shimmering in the sunshine before they disappeared with a flourish of tail flukes below the surface. A truly magical morning.

I watched
Dubknuck
for a couple of hours in
Penn Cove
today (
gray whale #44
). He circled the area close to Hwy 20 many times, and eventually headed in the direction of the Coupeville wharf. The water was like a mirror, gorgeous out there.
