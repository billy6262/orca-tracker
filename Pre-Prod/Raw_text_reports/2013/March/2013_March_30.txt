============================================================

Entry 1:
Bob Baumann reported that he spotted
one male orca in 7 fathoms off Gregory Point
(about 15 miles north of
Bandon OR
) on Saturday morning. He said it came out of the water three times.

We have a cabin on
Pender Island
, and while there last Saturday morning around
10 a.m.
we watched from
Mouat Point on North Pender Island
as
four orcas
headed south. They took their time and spent at least half an hour splashing and cavorting within our sight (about 1.5 km from shore). Then that afternoon, around

2:30 p.m.
,
four orcas
(the same?) passed by Mouat Point again going north, only this time they were extremely close to shore (around 10 metres). They didn't stop this time. I took some photos hoping to get a good picture. The next day I read on your website about
T40 "Captain Hook"
being with one of the pods that were in the Pender Island area that same day. Today after returning home to Victoria I uploaded my photos from camera to computer and, by George, I do think I got a picture of Captain Hook that afternoon before I knew who he was! I'm attaching the photo and hope you can give me a confirmation. If so, I'm elated as I knew after reading about him that someday I must meet the Captain.

We watched the
T018's
feeding on a steller sealion off the bluffs of
North Pender Island
.
T040
along with the
T86A's and T124A1
were nearby but did not participate.

So happy to see
T40 "Captain Hook"
today along with many other transient orcas (including the
T18's
) up by the
Pender Bluffs
just milling around. "Captain Hook" is usually seen in Southeast Alaska so it's super exciting to see him down here in the islands. Last time I saw him was spring 2010 outside Friday Harbor! The T18's had killed a steller sea lion and T40 with his posse appeared to be resting.

Had an amazing day out on the water with lots Transient orcas! Got to see
T40 "Captain Hook"
for the first time along with the
T18's, T86a's and T124a1
. TONS of tail slaps, a cartwheel, at least 5 breaches, a few pec slaps and T19B did a nice spy hop like always! Thanks Justin and Maya's Westside Whale Charters for the great time!!

. Lots of surface activity, munching of critters and tons of sunshine today! :)

I saw
5 or 6 Orcas
crossing the submerged portion of the
Columbia River south jetty
. They were traveling north, and appeared to be chasing a pod of sea lions for a short time. I didn't see them consume any of said sea lions.=
