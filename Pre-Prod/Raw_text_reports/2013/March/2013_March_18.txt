Orca Sightings for March 18, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately

6:50 PM
, my husband and I watched
a single Gray whale
off our deck at
Rocky Point
, on the Saratoga Passage. It appeared to be moving in a very leisurely manner. As it was very close to shore, we were able to see the white markings on it's back. It spy hopped once, milled about for a few minutes, then sounded and was gone. Marvelous!

"Spouting News" AT JUST THE RIGHT MOMEMT With a cup of morning Joe in one hand and pen, writing today's to do list in the other; glanced out the window. A spout and roll. Time? Around

7:15AM
. Suddenly, Joe and I were now out on the windy beach, at
Mariners' Cove (east of Oak Harbor
). Without the list. Watched and followed a short while as gray splashed, fed, and spouted its way southwestly towards Polnell Point. Not only followed the gray but also the fresh tracks of deer hooves left in the sand, walked earlier. With kingfisher chatter and bald eagle flying overhead left the Whidbey Island sea/wildlife and headed back, with Joe on empty. Having a merry heart which is good medicine, is a good start to the day. Not on my to do list earlier.
