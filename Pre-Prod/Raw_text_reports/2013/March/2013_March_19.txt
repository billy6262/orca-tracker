Orca Sightings for March 19, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A Gray whale
report from Barbara Brock: For the past half hour (starting about
11 AM
) I've been watching
1, probably 2, gray whales
feeding mid channel, more on the Whidbey side,
near Langley
. They have been shadowed by one boat, that had multiple blows right off the bow. The whale(s) are heading more in toward Langley now. Glassy calm water certainly helps the whale watching!
Barbara Brock, Mabana, Camano
