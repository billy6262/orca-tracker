Travels with K pod -
March 25 update - from NOAA's NWFSC
Over the past five days K25 (and presumably the rest of K-pod) has remained off the coast off southern Washington and northern Oregon. On the 20 March they were approaching the Astoria Canyon. On 21 March they went through the Astoria Canyon and traveled back north and were off the entrance to Grays Harbor on 22 March. They continued north and by the morning of the 23rd March were well to the northwest of Grays Harbor where they turned back south. By the morning of 24 March they were off the northern Oregon coast west of Cape Falcon. The whales then turned north and where off the entrance to Willipa Bay on the morning of the 25th. This map shows movements since ~4 AM yesterday, posted for Brad Hanson, Northwest Fisheries Science Center. Thanks to Robin Baird and Brad Hanson for keeping us updated.

Travels with K pod -
March 23 update - from NOAA's NWFSC
K-25 (and presumably the rest of K-pod) have spent the last week off the outer Washington coast - after veering offshore off the mouth of Juan de Fuca Strait on
March 18th, K25 returned inshore by the morning of the 19th, traveled south to off the mouth of the Columbia (on the 21st), and yesterday moved north to off of Grays Harbor. This morning K25 began heading south again and this afternoon was off the mouth of Willapa Bay. The satellite tag is probably getting close to the end of its battery life, so we expect to only get movements from K25 for another week or less. Map posted for Brad Hanson, Northwest Fisheries Science Center.
