Orca Sightings for March 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Coastal orcas
- At

10:29 am
Jim Border of Whale Spoken Here called to relay a real-time report of
at least two orcas
harassing
a gray whale
about a mile off
Cape Lookout OR
(between Lincoln and Tillamook). Seas are flat calm so visibility is good, but they are too far out to photograph. He did not see a calf. The action was proceeding as we spoke on the phone.
*
These whales (
orcas
) were found at
1230
off Cowichan Bay BC.
Ron Bates

740am -
swimming south in the Stuart Channel and passing Coffin Point
Ladysmith
(BC, between Duncan and Nanaimo). At least
4-6 Orcas
and one had a very large fin with a chunk out of the fin. Just passing by, not feeding or playing definitely moving fairly quickly. A great sighting as we see this every year.

4:00PM - two grays
feeding in
Port Susan Bay
off of Port Susan Terrace Beach on East side of Camano Island. One full sized adult and one smaller. They were moving south towards Camano Head.

off of

We (on Mystic Sea) found
2 gray whales in Holmes Harbor
this afternoon, feeding very close to shore. We identified one of them as
#21
- he continually rolled on his side with pectoral 'waving' and half his fluke showing. Quite an impressive display. On the west side - very high bluff - trees all the way down to the water. Nothing distinguishable along bluff to tell you exactly where, other than houses on top.

With these two that makes
6-7 whales
sighted (we left with 4-5 near Priest Point at

4:00
), and if the two seen in Saratoga at
1:12 by Tom N Tasha Hofer on the Mystic Sea (anyone have update on those two?) are not these two in Port Susan that makes
8-9 whales sighted in the north sound
.

4:00 - from Harbor view Park (Everett): looks like they have gotten to where they were going, we now see
4, possibly 5, grays
north of both the green channel marker and yellow buoy off of
Tulalip Shores/Everett
. Appears some foraging is happening as we see the occasional pec fin and lots of gull activity and they are kind of milling in wide berth. Very cool to have followed their travels to their feeding place.

3:20 -
they are mid sound out from
Hat/Tulalip/Everett
general direction eastbound.

2:25 -
bypassing Hat...they are midchannel
between Hat and Mukilteo ferry
heading (north) east.

2:00 -
the Possession
three grays
are heading towards
Hat/Gedney
.

1:40 -
three traveling tight together just fluked/dove in succession, breathtaking.

1:35 -
the
Possession Sound
three are still northbound approaching westbound
Clinton ferry lanes
soon. Beautiful calm.

1:00 -
still northbound in
Possession Sound
. For anyone looking from shore there is a whale watch boat and a couple of small pleasure boats near them. Seen quite a few flukes, long dives.

12:30 -
From
Mukilteo
beach seeing what up to three gray whales maybe a mile north of
Possession Point
northbound on Whidbey side.
