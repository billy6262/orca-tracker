Orca Sightings for March 17, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
After a shower of mixed hail and snow (how cool is that?!), we came across
two gray whales
traveling together, one of which may have been Patch (#49). By this time we had sunshine and the whales were right in the glare zone. My best photos from today's trip on Mystic Sea - two gray whales traveling towards
Gedney (Hat) Island
, later joined by
a third
(or overtaken by a third). Transient orca last weekend and warm sunshine, gray whales this weekend with a mix of hail, snow and sunshine. Variety is the spice of life...

3:40 -
leaving
three grays
: two travellin together east of mid way between
Hat and Everett
, moving steadily east. Single whale a bit east of Hat, hanging in same general location.

2:54 -
at least two still moving east into/towards
Port Gardner Bay
(is that what it's called?).

2:38 - they are between the south tip of
Hat/Gedney
and green channel marker.

Been watching
a gray
from our deck in Whidbey shores south of
fox spit
headed south along
Camano
. Must be the one that left Elger bay earlier today. It's close to Camano and moving south slowly. Been watching for a good 30 mins, I bet it can be seen from Langley now. Then at about

11:10 am
: Think there might be two! If you're out there looking, there us a boat near and they aren't far from the tip (South end of Camano) now.

Sunday, mid channel between Mabana Rd. on Camano and Bell's Beach on Whidbey. Seemed to be feeding and not moving much.

Elger Bay off of Camano Island
. They just left the bay and are heading south in Saratoga Passage.
