Orca Sightings for April 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just observed
4 orcas heading west in Haro Strait (
7:10 pm)
, along the south side of
Saturna
. 3 adults (appear to be 2 males, 1 female), one juvenile. The male has a very tall, narrowish dorsal fin that is slightly rippled. The youngster was travelling with this male. The other male and female were travelling together. They appeared to be swimming hard, slow and deliberate.
