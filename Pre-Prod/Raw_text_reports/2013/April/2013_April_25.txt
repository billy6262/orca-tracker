Orca Sightings for April 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Was out working on the hillside today and at about
1400 hrs, 2 adult greys swam by
, just off the buoy line, swimming towards the head of Port Susan. We live on the beach at Sunny Shores,
approximately 2 miles south of Kayak Point
. They were swimming together in the shallows. This is the 3rd such sighting in the last week or so where we have seen them within 150' or so from the shore in relatively shallow water.
