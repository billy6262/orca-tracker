bucking a big flood tide.

Just as we approached our

1:30
departure time, the sun broke out and the wind calmed down, and not five minutes from the dock we learned of Orcas close by. I LOVE my profession. We were soon there and here are some of the pictures that I was able to get. The pod made two kills in front of us, near Green Pt.,
Speiden Island
, and then travelled on. We left them headed toward
Waldron Island
.
