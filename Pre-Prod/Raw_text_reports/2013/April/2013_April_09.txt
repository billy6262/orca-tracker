We watched the
T036's, T099's, and T049C
work their way south along the shoreline of
Moresby Island
in the
afternoon
.
T020 and T021
along with the
T123's
were a couple of miles ahead also south bound near Turn Pt.

We had
~7 Bigg's orcas
midway down the east side of
Galiano Island
. We got to them around

12:30
. They had just made a kill and were quite active, though what they were eating is not known. Gulls were quick to show up and pick over the scraps. Parts of the
T49B's and T65A's
positively identified and no adult males in the group, so likely it was the full set of those two groups
to equal 7 animals
. After feeding, they headed north.
