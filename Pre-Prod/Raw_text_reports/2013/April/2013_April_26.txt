Orca Sightings for April 26, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were lucky enough to catch up with
T20 and T21 in the Strait of Georgia
today. At
3 PM
they were
3 miles NE of the Belle Chain Islets
, heading towards Active Pass. It turned out to be a beautiful afternoon.

MV Mystic Sea reporting at

3:30 p.m.
We are enjoying
at least five Gray Whales off to the east of Gedney (Hat Island)
. Able to identify
Patch and Dubnuk
. Lots of blows and rolls! We received reports from MV Whaler that earlier this afternoon, at

2:00, a Gray Whale was seen in a full breach!
A spectacular day!

Five grey whales
seen today, including Patch and Dubnuck. Whales were fairly 'surface' and didn't display their tail flukes or too much of themselves as they were either travelling steadily or feeding in shallow water. But once again wonderful whale watching conditions, warm, sunny, calm, as "Mystic Sea" cruised past Gedney (Hat) Island.

Errol reported an
unknown type of whale was seen off Alki Beach
.

I was at
Faye Bainbridge Park
this afternoon and thought I saw
a large whale
, but I didn't see a spout and I didn't see it again - now I'm wondering if I saw the humpback.

Yep, the Friday night ferry ride home was amazing. Just as the Bremerton ferry was about to dock at

5:20pm in Seattle
, I looked out to the north from the car deck and saw a huge black whale surfacing about 20 yards away from the docked BI ferry. It was headed north and I didn't see it surface again. I wasn't sure
it was a humpback
until I found these comments. A really great way to start the weekend.

We've received
two reports of a Humpback whale in Elliott Bay
this
evening
- boaters, please beware and keep on the lookout for this whale, staying at least 100 yards away - thanks!
First report was from Stephanie Raymond on board the Victoria Clipper, at
5 pm,
reporting the
Humpback heading NE in Elliott Bay
, across from the Duwamish Head marker.
Then we received a report from Maya Holstein at WA State Ferries, reporting a
Humpback whale at
5:33 pm, at Pier 52, Coleman Dock
, headed south.
*
The Water Taxi crew said they saw
a humpback between 5-6pm
and that it was heading out of
Elliot Bay past Duwamish Head
.

Hi from
South Africa
. A small group and myself went out Saturday to see how the sarine run was coming along off our shore in Port Elizabeth when we came upon
7 Orca hunting Dolphin
, quite a show. I got in the water after they were done and noticed one of the Orca was missing a Pectoral fin (and a dorsal fin). It also had teeth marks just before the tail. I was wondering what could be the cause? I have video on my facebook page (shared on the Orca Network facebook page) that shows this. I would love some input.
