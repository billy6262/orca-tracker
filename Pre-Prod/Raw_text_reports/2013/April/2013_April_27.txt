Kenny called Orca Network to report seeing
4-5 orcas
, one with a very large dorsal fin, in
Winchester Bay
in the
Umpqua River in Oregon about
2:30 in the afternoon
.
*
Despite the mild rain we encountered today, both boats were quick to find
transient killer whales near Trial Island
, who were later identified as whales
T20 and T21
of the transient orca group. The boats then went further towards San Juan Island, encountering a different group of 7 transients
hunting and killing a large sea lion in the middle of Haro Strait!
The whales were actively spy hopping and breaching as they were in a hunting frenzy around the lone sea lion.

I was over by
Ruston Way (Tacoma)
. It was dusk. I heard and saw
a whale
breach the water. I was at the fishing dock. Then as I watched breached the water again somewhere close to the Red Lobster. I jumped in my truck drove up to the parking lot just before road turns to go up to Ruston. I looked back towards the flats and saw it again. This time I saw that magnificent tail. Then just past the parking lot it came up and I saw a complete view of its side. There was no white at all. It was not huge but then it was definitely bigger than any porpoise I have ever seen. The last time I saw it was as it came up near the new condos where the asarco stack was. When I got in my truck to leave it was

9:10 pm.
What an amazing sight! I didn't even know they came into Commencement bay.

We saw
a whale off Tahlequah
(south end of Vashon Island) by the ferry dock about
4 PM
, heading east toward Maury Island. (could this be the Humpback that was in Elliott Bay the day before?)

I saw
a whale
close to shore at low tide at
Edmonds beach
. I heard the spout and looked over just to see it go back down. It was heading south at about

12:30-
1:00 pm
.
