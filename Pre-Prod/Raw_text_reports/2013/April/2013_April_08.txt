Perfect whale watching conditions from "Mystic Sea" today, no rain, no wind, calm seas and whales off
Gedney (Hat) Island, Sandy Point (Langley) and Pebble Beach, Camano Island
, including
#49 Patch
cruising past Gedney with a friend.
#22 and #723
were spotted later off Camano (thank you Pam, Marilyn, Alisa and Ed for the excellent photos and help with ID). A memorable day in the company of our leviathan friends with a whiff of whale breath thrown in for good measure...

On the
10 am ferry to Clinton
, Ed spotted a whale in the ferry lanes heading northeast towards Hat/Gedney Island. Once underway aboard the Mystic Sea out of Langley, at

11:40 I spotted a gray whale blow
directionally towards
Tulalip Bay
. As we motored towards him Ed and I (as well as Pam, Marilyn, and others) continued to see his blows and back as he surfaced and dived. Once in that area the whale never surfaced there again so we turned towards Hat/Gedney Island where blows could be seen from afar. We headed that way and at

12:15 we encountered gray whales #21 and #22 about 1 mile northwest of Hat Island
. We stayed with these two for about an hour as they swam together circling our drifting boat in 500 foot waters (at times we thought there were three whales but we cannot find evidence in photo's or video).
We moved south over to the northwest tip of Hat where Capt. Monty had seen a whale feeding near shore. It was there we met up with
#49 Patch
with his iconic "patch" marking and
#723
who by then were traveling together southeast along the bottom of Hat. We left those two about

1:30-
1:45
and headed north back towards Camano head. Approaching Saratoga Passage, in the bay north of Pebble Beach (Camano Island) we could see blows ahead and at

2:05 we once again encountered #21 and #22
traveling northbound in the passage. Throughout the day we were treated to much beauty and the added beauty of the diving fluke of #22 on about 6 occasions.
A most memorable day in our magical northwest waters in the company of whales and friends. Wonderful and interesting to think of their relationships and how long many of these whales have been traveling together.
