Orca Sightings for April 22, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
From
Harborview Park (in Everett, near Mukilteo) at
3:00pm
I can see
two gray whales
near Everett. They are close to the Tulalip side and are moving slowly toward Everett. Lots of blows and splashing.
