10 am -
there is
a baby gray whale near the Purdy Bridge
. I got the news off your facebook page, and I've been watching a live feed from Kiro 7. The whale does not look healthy. It is very weakly swimming back and forth, and was stuck on a sand bar for a while. Hopefully there is something someone can do for this little whale.

Sweet little
gray whale
in
south Puget Sound
, among other big concerns, appears to have a sizable chunk out of her/his pec fin. Holding little one in my heart.

At

09:17
we spotted a minimum of
three killer whales
approximately three miles offshore of Wedding Rock, Patrick's Point State Park,
Trinidad, CA
. The individuals were either immature males and/or females. I am a graduate student at Humboldt State University studying gray whales. I was conducting shore surveys with an intern. Because they were far out it was hard to track and see what they were doing but within our hour of surveying we saw multiple surfacings. From our position they moved from compass bearing 265 to 280 throughout the survey. Hope this is helpful.
