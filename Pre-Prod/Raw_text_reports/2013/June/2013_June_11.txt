============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Rocky Geyer reporting a sighting of
2 juvenile or female orcas in the Columbia River
yesterday morning,
June 11th, around
9 or 10 am
. The orcas were between buoys 12 & 14,
east of Cape Disappointment near the Clatsop spit
. He tried to get photos of them but was unsuccessful. The charter captain he was with said he had only seen orcas in the river twice in 40 years.

Marauder IV is at
Hein Bank
right now watching
Minke Whales
. The engines were powered off and all of the crew and guests were watching these 30ft critters feeding! Out of the blue one Minke gave us a show to remember and swam right under the boat!!!! Totally unexpected. Incredible.
