Orca Sightings for June 21, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was sitting on the patio around

7:30 a.m.
and heard a whale breath. I looked out to see a small whale,
could be the gray
spotted the other day. I am not sure what kind it was. It was in
Eld Inlet South of Flap Jack Point
, swimming north. It hung out in the area between Flap Jack and Green Cove for a few minutes and then I lost sight of it.

I received a report from Gotcha Fishing Charters that a group of
T's
were east bound at

6:30 am
near
Secretary Island, East Sooke Park
in the morning. We found the
T069A's and T069D at
10:30
east bound at Albert Head. They then turned around and backtracked out west along the shoreline of Vancouver Island.

Whales everywhere! We had some early morning reports of
whales near Albert head and whales off Eagle point
so we started to head down that way. En route, we bumped into the
T65A's with T75C in Active Pass
! They headed north into the Strait of Georgia and then started to go west up Galiano Island.
