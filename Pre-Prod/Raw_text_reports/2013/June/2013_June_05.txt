Another shot from this afternoon's encounter with the
orcas
. This is my absolute favorite whale,
L87 Onyx
. You can see he is swimming through a kelp bed and is absolutely covered with the stuff. Orcas have very sensitive skin and they do enjoy touching each other or swimming through kelp beds. Perhaps they do it to scratch an itch or perhaps they just like the way it feels - a bit like a day at the spa complete with a seaweed wrap.

It was another incredible day on the
west side of San Juan Island. From

4:00-
5:30 PM J-Pod and most if not all of L-Pod
slowly made their way north past Land Bank's Westside Preserve. They were in tight, slow moving groups with no apparent hurry to go anywhere, as they went back and forth several times before finally meandering north. It's always fun to see how the whales mix and match with each other. A couple examples from today:
L41 was with J19 and J41, and J27 was in hot pursuit of L53
. It's shaping up to be an amazing season for shore-based whale-watching here!
