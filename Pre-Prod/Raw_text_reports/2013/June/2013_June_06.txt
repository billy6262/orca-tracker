Orca Sightings for June 6, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening from

7:00-
7:45 PM
we watched a group of
L-Pod whales
head south past
Lime Kiln Point State Park
. They were mostly in travel mode, but the L55s stopped to forage for a few minutes and at one point launched a salmon into the air! Those of us that stayed to watch the sunset were surprised at
8:50 PM when L22 and her two sons L79 and L89 came by close to the rocks heading north at a good clip. They, along with the rest of the L12 subgroup, had been off the south end of the island, but it was only those three that came north. Perhaps they were going to meet up with J-Pod, as they were still to the north?

Wow - there they go again, loud
calls and clicks at
9:25 pm at lime kiln
.
After total silence for quite awhile, suddenly LOUD
calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone at
8:50 pm
- they are talking right into the mics!
ON

They were nice and close for us today! We found them right at
Sand Heads
(a few miles west from the mouth of the Fraser River) heading south and they were VERY spread. I saw
mostly L's (L95, L92, L55, L103, L53, L72, L82 and L105)
but there were J's in the mix too (we only ID'd J27 and J34). It was such a gorgeous day on the water. Near the end of our trip, we had a bunch of L's come together vocalizing and socializing.....it was incredible.

Just saw four,
possibly five orcas, eastbound along Rich Passage, at Port Orchard Bay (
6:30PM)
. Looks like three fems, possibly one male, probably feeding. They were eastbound, closer to the Bremerton side of the passage, disappeared for a few minutes, then were again seen eastbound, closer to our location at Waterman Cove, which is the transition area between Rich Passage and Sinclair Inlet. Nice to see them again!

The
transients in Kitsap County
today (these photos were taken in
Port Washington Narrows
). What a treat that was! I went to Auke Bay early last month and saw a few from a distance; went to Lime Kiln Point over Memorial Day weekend and saw none. Today, right in my backyard!
