Orca Sightings for June 3, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Victoria Clipper III spent some time yesterday with
L25 Ocean Sun and L41 Mega off Eagle Point on San Juan Island
. A minke whale was with them. Curiously,
L25 and the minke seemed to be following each other around
. They were surfacing in tandem and changing directions together, and were probably within 200 yards of each other each time they surfaced. Has anyone else observed minkes and southern residents appearing to interact in that way?
