Orca Sightings for June 22, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I wanted to report a sighting of a
[gray] whale
. We saw it in
Little Skookum Inlet
on Saturday. It's a very small shallow inlet so we were worried about it stranding itself, although I haven't heard reports of a stranding yet. Also in 2006 there was a minke that stranded itself right near where we saw it.

What a cool day on the water! We were watching
L77 and L119
aboard The Odyssey of San Juan Excursions today when suddenly, this
minke whale
appeared alongside them!
L77, L119, and the minke all surfaced together
several times alongside the vessel. The same minke was later that day seen swimming with L41. Absolutely incredible.

L22 Spirit & her sons L79 Skana & L89 Solstice
reached the south end of
Lime Kiln
just shortly before the start of Orca Sing. Skana must have turned back south as Spirit & Solstice rode the tide to the lighthouse, surfacing back and forth in the calm sea, as friends visited and the music played on. Perfect beauty.

We had a very interesting day of sightings today. The Western Prince II found
a Humpback Whale in San Juan Channel at about
10:45 AM
. In the afternoon we encountered
4-6 Minke Whales
lunge feeding near
Salmon Bank
. Later, with the
L12s
we had a
Minke Whale
swimming with
L41
for about 20 minutes.

From

8:30-
9:00 PM
I watched part of the
L12
sub-group of
L-Pod
head south from
American Camp on San Juan Island
. They were quite a ways offshore, but it was a beautiful sight in the sunset with flat-calm waters and the Olympic Mountains in the background. The sounds of the blows really carried. The only whale I could ID for sure was
L85
, but my guess was all but the L22s were there.

L22's
today along
San Juan Island
. It was great to watch
L22 cruise along with her sons L79 and L89
. Then on the way home, we ran into
a Humpback at Monarch Head
along Saturna Island! Beautiful flat calm seas all day long....life is good!
