Note: Others saw Dall's porpoises in the area, which from a distance can look like orcas.

So good to see
J-Pod
AND the
L12s
today off the west side. It was another spectacular shore-based encounter. Plus five eagles providing close flybys as an added bonus! Check out my page at Orca Watcher Photography to see some photos. The first one I posted is of adult male L41 Mega in the kelp.
