============================================================

Entry 1:
From KitsapSun @
5:23 pm: Someone just called our office to report seeing a
whale in the Manette area
, northwest of Bremerton. She couldn't identify what kind. Anybody else seeing this?
Susan Marie Andersson
This is probably the gray whale that's been seen in Puget Sound recently
.
