Orca Sightings for June 27, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
What a bonus!
A humpback whale (BCY324) near Bird Rocks
, only 30 minutes from leaving Anacortes on "Mystic Sea." Passengers enjoyed hearing the powerful blows and seeing the flick of those magnificent tail flukes before they disappeared into the depths as the whale headed around the
south end of Lopez
. Just one thing missing - the memory card from my camera.
