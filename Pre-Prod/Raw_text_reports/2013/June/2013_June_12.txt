Orca Sightings for June 12, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had word of 'about
10' orcas near Porlier Pass
(Gulf Islands) just before we left the dock. We scurried over and soon found a cavalcade of whales, about
20 in all
. These included
T65As, T124As, T20/T21 and T86As
. It was a drizzly day and they weren't doing much more than just a fairly swift travel north, but the weather and the amount of whales made it a spectacular sight. Including shot of T124A2 and calf T124A2A making an energetic surfacing!
