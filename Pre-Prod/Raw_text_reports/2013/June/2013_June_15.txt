Orca Sightings for June 15, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw and heard a whale last Sat. -
grey whale
, we think - but it was sort of backlit by setting sun. We were on a mooring on the west side of
Eagle Island in south Puget Sound
. It came up the west side of Anderson Island and headed east between Eagle and McNeil through Balch Passage. It was around
9pm
. It came up for breath 3 times. We didn't see any markings or fins.

Another long journey through the Salish Sea, pratically back to mainland to catch up with two familes of seven
Transient Killers
hanging together. We got there Justin-time! to see them hunt seals off
Guemes Island
and boy did they get excited!

Chuck Wood called to report seeing
3-4 orca about 4 miles from shore, roughly 7 miles NW of the Heceta Head OR lighthouse, at 1 pm
. No photos. He saw the poster with our number at the marina in Florence OR.

Quite a few
transients in Rosario Straits
today, we left them heading south towards
Washington Park around 3 pm
- they could possibly be headed down Admiralty Inlet ....

3 pm -
Orca Network received a message from a gentleman watching
a single orca
with a small fin (female? or maybe the humpback whale from the above post? or possibly one of the Risso's Dolphins that has been around?) just south of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, between the Day Island Marina and the west side, closer to the west side, milling and fishing.
