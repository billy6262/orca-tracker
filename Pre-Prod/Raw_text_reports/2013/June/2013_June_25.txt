Orca Sightings for June 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Minke Whales were fantastic today! On our 12 Noon Western Explorer trip we found
4 at Eastern Bank and then 3 at Hein Bank
. We heard reports from other boats of at least 4 more in the general area too! On the way in we spent some time with our Harbor Seal friends and found a mating pair of Bald Eagles. Beautiful day!
