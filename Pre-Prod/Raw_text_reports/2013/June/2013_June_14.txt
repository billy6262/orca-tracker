I can't say anything but WOW about todays trip! We left
Vancouver
and within 20 minutes, we found the
T86A's and the T101's
around
Point Grey (UBC)
heading straight for downtown Vancouver. I didn't think they would go all the way but they proved me wrong! They went all the way
into Coal Harbour
right in the heart of downtown!!! Pedestrians gathered all over the seawall at Stanley Park as the whales swam by. The T101's made a pit stop under the lions gate bridge to make a quick kill and then continued on their way.
