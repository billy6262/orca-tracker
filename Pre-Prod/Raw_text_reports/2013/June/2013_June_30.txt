a group of orcas
heading north.

I saw
2 Orca, one male, heading out of Admiralty Inlet
past Point Wilson at about
4 pm
this afternoon. Moving fast.

Have heard a second hand report of someone crossing on the
Edmonds ferry seeing a small pod of 4-6 orca
headed north, closer to the Kingston side.....anyone else seen or heard anything?

Beautiful day for kayaking! AND whale sightings! We launched off
Possession Point about 11am
, and as we were rowing along the homes to the south, several people told us that they had just seen
Orcas
going by. Sure enough, as we rounded the furthest point, we saw several!! They were too distant to id them, but close enough to really enjoy! They turned west and then disappeared. What a treat!! The one funny thing we noticed were an usually high number of seals that had swam into the shallows! It was probably a good idea, unless they wanted to become lunch!

So much life out there today! We had an incredible encounter with about
4 Minke Whales at Eastern Bank
this
afternoon
. At one point there were three large bait balls all around us with 2 Minke Whales lunging through them!
