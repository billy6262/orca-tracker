============================================================

Entry 1:
This morning
K25 (and presumably the rest of K-pod) was off Bodega Bay, California
, apparently having turned back north about 20 km north of Point Reyes.

1:30 pm - A lone Killer whale
was just spotted swimming through
Elliott Bay Marina
here in Seattle between I and J dock then disappeared. Have been scouring the waters looking but did not see him again to get photo. It was like WOW I was standing on the bow of my boat replacing the bulb in my bow light and it surfaced right in front of me. Blew a big breath out and a big one in and disappeared. Also looking for others in the area but none seen.

2:22 - A single grey whale
is passing between us
(south end of Camano) and Langley
. It is moving slowly, from the south into Saratoga Passage. It was taking it's time, we watched it for 15 minutes before it traveled out of sight to the NW. It was about ¼ the distance into the Passage.
