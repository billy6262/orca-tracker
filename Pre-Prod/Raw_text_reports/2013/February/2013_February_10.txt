Orca Sightings for February 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we saw
about 12 Orcas in Tumbo Channel off Saturna Island at about 11 am
. They headed east, and rounded East Point. We also heard whales in Tumbo Channel last night (2/9) about 6 pm, but it was too dark to see them. It's very unusual for them to go through Tumbo Channel for some reason.

Our first
grey whale
sighting this morning, SE of Pebble Beach on the
south end of Camano Island
. It came up in the fog for three breaths, then disappeared like a ghost.
