Orca Sightings for February 15, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas seen approximately 3pm
, about 3 miles
south of Victoria BC
, along the MV Coho route between Port Angeles, WA and Victoria, BC. 1 small pod of 1 male plus what looked like 4 other individuals, heading south. Seen about 250 meters off the port side of the MV Coho, swimming and surfacing every 20-30 seconds. I didn't have binoculars and couldn't make out any distinguishing marks/scars.

While following up a report of killer whales spotted from a B.C. ferry in the morning I came across
T020 and T021
in the afternoon west of
Beaumont Shoals
heading south. I left them at
1430
south of Discovery Island and on my way to Race Rocks I spotted
T002B with the T060's south of Constance Bank
west bound. The
T030's
were a couple of miles south of them also west bound.
