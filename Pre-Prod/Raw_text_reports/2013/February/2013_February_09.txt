Orca Sightings for February 9, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was a pleasant surprise this morningto hear
J-Pod Group B (the J11s, J22s, and J17s)
were heading towards San Juan Island. They came into view from the
Land Bank Westside Preserve around
11:30 AM
and slowly made their way towards shore and then north up Haro Strait. J17 was in the lead with the rest of her family a little ways behind her. It was impressive to watch them briefly surf a freighter wake! J34 then spent a lot of time foraging just offshore of us between 12 and 1 as the whales were visible to the north and south, mostly milling and doing long dives. I watched them from shore until about
1:30, and when I left whales were still in view from there.
Between
2:30 and
4:15
I had a chance to go out on the water with John Boyd and we spent some great time with the whole J17 matriline (plus J31, J22, J32, and possibly J38) in Haro Strait not far from Snug Harbor. The whales seemed in a lazy mood most of the day, moving slowly. They would go on some long dives, but in between would spend time rolling around on the surface together. We heard an amazing number of above water vocalizations all day - I've never heard so many over such a length of time before. They were mostly in a fairly tight group, with J17 at times off by herself. It was awesome to get some "whale time" in these chilly winter months. It was also fun to catch up with all the whale folks who came out to see them! More photos of the encounter will be posted on my
blog

Had a great visit with
J Pod today off San Juan Island
and an encounter with Blackberry in the centre of Haro Strait. I think he has missed all the whale watchers because he came right over to us!
