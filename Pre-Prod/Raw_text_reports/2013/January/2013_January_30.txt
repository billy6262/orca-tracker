Boy, they can sure disappear quickly! Watch a group of
probably 3
out near mid channel, some circling, spyhopping and involved in some kind of commotion in the water.
Then came a bull
about halfway between shore and the ones mid channel; then not long after that
came a female
around the rocky jetty right off the
Edmonds Marina
. She hugged the shoreline just off the dog park. Lots of seagulls appeared from out of nowhere hoping for a free meal. And, she was headed right towards a cute little seal I had been watching for awhile right off the beach!....Last time I saw her, she surfaced probably only about 100 ft from the seal; I was sure he was a goner! In fact, since she had surfaced so close and was headed directly towards where the seal was, I was sure I was going to see an attack, so I focused my camera on the seal and waited....but, it was the seal's lucky day I guess, because the whale dove and was gone after that. I think one of the others had probably made a kill way out when all the splashing activity was going on, so she probably got called back out to them. After that, I hung around for almost an hour and never saw sight of them again

This was my first sighting. I saw
8 breaches from the north end of Golden Gardens
. It was about

12:30 PM
and I believe they were hunting sea lions. I am not sure how many orcas were out there. They were in the area about 5 minutes and then seemed to be heading south. They were too far out to notice any unusual markings or to get photos with my cell. I was alone at first and the whole thing felt surreal, but then 2 other groups of people came along...also excited about seeing orcas.

We received a report from Marsha Lagerloef, of the
Transient pod of orcas milling off the southern tip of Bainbridge Island from 5 -
