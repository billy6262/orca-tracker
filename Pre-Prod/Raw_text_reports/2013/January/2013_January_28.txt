Orca Sightings for January 28, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was riding home on the

4:33
Sounder from King station and briefly saw
a pod of orcas
. They were headed south and I saw them just a little
south of Shoreline
. I am not sure how many were in pod.

Pretty sure this is the first whale report ever from a train

3:45 -
I saw
a pod of orcas (probably 10+
with males way out front of the main group) off the coast of
Edmonds (near the ferry dock)
. They were traveling south, and didn't appear to be actively playing or feeding, although they were traveling right along a shelf where people often fish from boats. The only distinctive markings I saw were on an adult female who appeared to have a single noticeable notch near the top of her fin, however I could be mistaken on this. Seemed to be several females with calves in the group. In fact, there seemed to be more with calves than without. Hope this is helpful.

3:58 update -
both groups quickly made it to
Marina Beach park (south Edmonds)
made some sort of kill and have moved on. Nice spyhops too!

3:10 -
just picked them up. Out from
Brown's Bay, north Edmonds
coming South.

1:48 pm -
Saw some
orcas off Lighthouse Park in Mukilteo
- at least two- maybe a few more. Just kind of milling around. One was kind of going the opposite direction for a bit. Probably the same pod that's been spotted around recently.

About
10 AM
today I went down to our beach (
Mabana Beach, Camano Island
) to try and find why we had so many eagles circling low,
8-10
instead of the usual 2-3. Also noticed an unusual number of seals in close to shore, 5-6 instead of maybe one. While I was scanning the water out over Saratoga Passage, suddenly there was a whale blow off the drop-off about 600 feet out. First thought was gray whale, but of course much to early. Then saw numerous orca fins, including one male. They were heading south fairly rapidly, but did see what looked like a large feeding lunge. With the seals in close to shore, my first thought was transients, but maybe there were fish attracting everyone, orcas, seals, and eagles?? This is the first time in 15 years I've seen orca off our beach on our side of Saratoga Passage.
