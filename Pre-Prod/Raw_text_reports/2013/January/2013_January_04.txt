Orca Sightings for January 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went out to Mutiny Bay Shores and saw the
Orcas head south past Hansville
. They were probably about a mile offshore, but we got to see a great spyhop as they played around before heading south.

Jill Hein observed
6 orcas
(Dave Ellifrit: One pic shows
T49B and her kid T49B2
. The female in the last pic is
T65B
) passing
Bush Pt
(west Whidbey Island), 100' from shore heading south. She is getting some photographs - sounds like a great passby.

about a dozen orca at Lagoon Point heading south at

While at work today, we got 911 calls about an 'orca' stuck in some driftnets in the
Puyallup River
-- no joke. I sent a Deputy to check on this 'sighting' and he got there and confirmed something massive appeared to be swimming up river and thought it was a sea lion that was stuck. Another Deputy arrived and said, "I may be wrong, but this thing's a lot bigger than a sea lion. I think ... I think it
looks like the grey whale
that's been seen in this area." He said it was massively bigger than any sea lion he'd seen (his wife works as a marine biologist at Pt. Defiance) and swears
it was a grey whale
. Whatever it was broke free from it's unseen confine that seemingly held it in place and was able to get turned around in the river. It obviously wasn't an orca, but something large and in charge was out there swimming and eating salmon today.
It was seen around 1 pm today near the Fife area, just south of the Clark's Creek Bridge where it crosses over at 66th Avenue East
. No one, as far as I know, got pictures.

Some
gray whale
sightings were reported to NOAA
off Shilshole
, far from the Puyallup River where the alleged gray whale was seen yesterday, so it sounds like we have more than one large whale swimming around in Puget Sound.
