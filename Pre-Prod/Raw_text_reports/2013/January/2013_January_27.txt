just outside of
Gig Harbor at
1:00pm
today. At

12:50
a group of 4 adults and a baby
passed Pt. Defiance
, crossed over toward Vashon and appeared to head north up Colvos Passage. Immediately after that, a group of 4 large Orcas passed us heading north. Just off the mouth of Gig Harbor. The ones near the Gig Harbor side put on a little show for us. Tail flips and side rolls. AWESOME! They were just a couple hundred feet from shore.

Map from NOAA from

Entry 2:
06:38 am - Satellite tag project update: K25 is currently off the mouth of the Columbia River. In order to extend the transmission life of the satellite tag it had been programmed to start duty cycling to transmit only specific days and times starting on Friday, so there are now longer gaps in the locations coming in from the tag. Thus we'll start posting maps only every second day - the map shows movements from ~2 AM Friday through this morning, posted for Brad Hanson, Northwest Fisheries Science Center.
