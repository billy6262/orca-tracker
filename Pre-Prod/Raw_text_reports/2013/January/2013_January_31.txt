Another report of the
Transient pod (~4 whales)
from Bruce Martin at

1:40 pm
- they were about 1 mile off the Kingston Ferry dock, N. Kitsap peninsula. They circled for awhile, looking like they may have been feeding on a kill, then headed north.
*
When we saw them off
Fay Bainbridge Park
they were traveling spread out. A big male came through solo quite a bit ahead if
a group of 5-6
. Slightly ahead of the group and closer the shore was another solo whale. Smaller but possibly another male. Well behind them all there was
another group of 4 or so
.

They're too close to shore for me to see from here any longer (houses in the way) so I hand them off to those of you at
Fay Bainbridge
. Happy whale watching!
