Orca Sightings for January 6, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
My girlfriend and I saw what I assume were the
Orcas seen off Shilshole
. After seeing the Network facebook post we went to
Sunset Park which overlooks Shilshole and West Point
. From there we saw the whales briefly around

4:50 pm
they were quite far away and had already rounded West point Heading SE towards Elliot Bay still fairly close to shore. I could not get an accurate count but it was a small group (less than ten). I figured I would send this along after reading about the calf found at dungeness spit. The sighting was especially cool for us because not only did we see the whales but at the same time saw a Snowy Owl who has been roosting near Sunset Park which overlooks Shilshole.

The
2 adults and one baby
where feeding around

8:45am
right in front of our home on
Marine View Dr. Mukilteo WA
. They were heading south-southwest, circling and staying in the shallow areas of water that are just off our coast. I know the area pretty well from kayaking it. They stayed on the shelf that extends roughly Â¼ mile off shore, and did not go deep at all. In fact they were swimming at the surface for much of the observation. They hung out for about 20 minutes as they did their circles. Each of the whales where definitely swimming on their own accord.

Jeff McKee called in after watching
four orcas about 300 yards off the breakwall of the Shilshole marina between 3 pm and
3:30
. A male and a juvenile were in the group. They stayed within a 50' circle for at least a half hour, occasionally spyhopping and taillobbing. A half dozen sea lions watched from the rocks the entire time.

My wife and I were at
Richmond Beach
(about 3 miles south of the Edmonds ferry dock) this afternoon around
noon
and watched
a pod of orcas approx 1/4 mile off the beach.
They were basically staying in one area, circling, possibly feeding, as they breached, leaped several times and were very visible to all on the beach. I think there were
approx 8 to 12 adults and several juveniles
. We watched them for almost 30 minutes and they stayed visible until a sailboat motored into their presence, at which point they became very hard to see, moving North to stay away from the sailboat. I don't know what pod they were.
