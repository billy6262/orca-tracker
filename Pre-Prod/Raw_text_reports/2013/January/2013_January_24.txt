Orca Sightings for January 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw two what I assume were
Bigg's Killer Whales
again today. First one was swimming north; then another one came along behind; then they were both swimming together, then they disappeared; then I saw them one more time. Shortly a seal came swimming along, but it disappeared as well. This was between
3 and
3:30
in Possession Sound along the
Mukilteo shoreline
where I have been seeing whales regularly.
