I didn't see the male when they were traveling by the south end of the marina, definitely saw
2-3 adult females at that point and 2 babies
(one still looked pinkish and was awful cute). But, I had checked for the orcas just a couple minutes before I first saw them and at that point saw a harbor seal moving very quickly past the marina. Saw the females and babies very shortly thereafter moving quickly past the marina (SE would be the technical direction) and then went out into the parking lot/shoreline (near Ray's boat house) and after seeing nothing for a couple of minutes, all of a sudden there was a huge amount of action amongst the adults and it was at that point i was fairly certain i saw the male. I'm just over 5 feet tall and was essentially standing at sea level and the male surfaced directly in front of me (I was looking through binocs), so the size of the dorsal fin was fairly impressive from that vantage point--very tall, very straight and moving very quickly and purposefully. This all happened within the space of about 20-25 minute. I'm pretty sure the little harbor seal didn't make it out of that encounter.

1:45 -
Caught them between
Shilshole marina
and west point, mid-way between our side and
Bainbridge Island
. Watching from the parking lot just west of Ray's Boathouse. It could be that I was watching from sea level and the size was distorted, but it really looked like they had been joined by a male...and were making a kill. There was splashing for about five minutes and then they seemingly disappeared and a research vessel that apparently had been watching them returned to the marina. The visibility isn't great from this side either, so I couldn't tell exactly where they went but it might be worthwhile keeping an eye out from west point and magnolia.

We've got them directly off the
south end of Shilshole marina
, close in, moving quickly.

They appeared to head south again and then i could just barely make them out heading out more towards mid channel off of
shilshole marina
.
1215 pm -
Just sighted them off of
golden gardens
. They appear to be milling near green buoy off the north end of golden gardens. Lots of seagulls nearby, possibly picking up scraps of a kill? Saw them splashing from
carkeek
.

Last I saw they were passing
Richmond Beach Saltwater park
, east of the yellow weather buoy, still southbound.
2 females 3 young ones
, with two of those looking quite young. Maybe a sprouter male but definitely no mature male. Visibility getting worse.

10:30 -
they are passing north
Richmond Beach
steadily south bound well this side.

10:15 -
I moved to
Kayu Kayu Ac park
(north Richmond Beach, just south of Point Wells) and have not seen them. I may have been premature in moving, they may have stalled or turned?

9:45 -
lunging behavior just of
Edmonds fishing pier
. I was too far south to get photos but then moved up there. They resurfaced 1/2 mile out, resumed steady pace southbound, now more east of mid channel, between
south Edmonds and coming upon Kingston
. 2 calves I believe, got some decent video.

9:25 - they are just passing in front of Edmonds ferry still southbound good pace. 5-6 whales.

9:05 -
picked up the
3 orca
, look like Ts. Last I saw they were just south of
Brown's Bay (north Edmonds)
still trending south, and moved a bit away from shore. moved south to ferry haven't found them yet.
