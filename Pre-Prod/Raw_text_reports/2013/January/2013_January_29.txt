This pod of
Transients/Bigg's were milling around the Blake Island/Manchester/Bainbridge
area for at least an hour. I picked them up from the South Beach shore of Bainbridge around
3 pm
. Between
3:30 & 4 they started tail slapping, & spy hoping. There was a small boat right in the thick of things and a few times I thought it would surely flip over. Then around
3:40ish I observed lots of splashing and flocks of seagulls going crazy. Close to 4 the largish male did what looked like a double victory breach just before they all headed north east toward Restoration Point.
3:30 pm - Feeding frenzy off northwest side if Blake. Have been watching several Transients for 30+ min. Spy hops and tail slaps galore. What a great afternoon! Thank you Orca Network for making this possible. I've lived on Bainbridge for over 20 years and have only started seeing Orcas from shore since following your Facebook page last November.

Sandra Clifton called to report seeing
5 orcas, including 1 male and 1 calf, milling by the dock at Manchester at
3:30 pm
. They were splashing around, coming up out of the water a lot, so possibly may have made a kill. After their activity near the Manchester dock, they headed toward Seattle (E/NE).

3:53 pm - Four Killer Whales
feeding by oil dock and inside bouy line at
Manchester
for the past hour or so. Now gone. I have some not so close photos.

I saw a pod of
Orcas today about
3:30 pm
near the fuel dock at
Manchester
. They came in from north of Blake Island and came quite close to the beach just south of the public boat launch there. Difficult to count, but it looked like about four females and I think a couple of males. There was also one noticeably smaller fin, a juvenile, but I don't know how old. Mostly they just spouted and arched their backs, but there were some tail slaps and a couple of complete breaches where they fell back on their sides. I assume they were salmon fishing. That's what I was doing. After about an hour they headed back out. It looked like they were going north east back into the Sound. There were several people watching and taking cell phone pictures.

Marie Waterman of the WSF called to relay a report from a ferry captain of
a single male orca off Bouy Fort
, headed north toward
Restoration Point
.

Chad Hesselein called to say he had seen
a pod of orcas off Manchester
(south of Bainbridge Island), heading north.

There was a pod of
whales in Manchester at
3:00
today. These pictures were taken by Geretta Jensen from up at their home above Manchester. They swam around the guard boat from the base and went off
past the Manchester fuel depot towards Blakely rock
..North towards Bainbridge.

Spotted an
Orca pod of approximately 4
. 75 yards along the southeast side of the
Southworth ferry dock
. Heading northbound towards Blake Island, then turned left along the south shore of Blake Island westbound towards Yukon Harbor...Happened around 14:1. Cresting and blowing. Hard to make out any other details.

1:36 -
also at
Prospect Point
, the 2 adults and baby were followed about 10 minutes later by 4 adults, did you get to see them jumping and splashing their tails? Great to watch!

My son and my dad both said they saw
at least 5 Orcas come through Colvos Passage at
12:48
! We are off Prospect Point! They were moving FAST and I barely got my camera out! I was able to snap a few pictures. They were heading towards Seattle!

I got a brief glimpse of
an orca at about
12:30pm
today. The whale(s) was(were) rapidly headed north nearer the
vashon
side. I think it was a male. There may have been others. The distance away, rapid speed, and infrequent appearance made it difficult to determine anything more.
Steve, Point, Richmond Beach, Gig Harbor.

, south of
Lisa Buela, 3-4
, moving quickly northwards.
