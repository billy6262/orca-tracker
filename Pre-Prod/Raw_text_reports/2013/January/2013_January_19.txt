Orca Sightings for January 19, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Early in the morning I heard a few
SRKW calls
on the
Orca Sound and Lime Kiln hydrophones
. The whales were located several hours later
between Discovery Island and Trial Island
, heading west. They were the
J11s, J17s, J22s and J16s
. In the afternoon we encountered them west of Victoria heading toward Race Rocks. At first they were spread out and after a while they grouped up and appeared to be very playful, except for Mike J-26 who, during the last part of our encounter had moved farther south from the rest of the whales. The whales were slowly moving west. Once they made a direct change of direction to the south and east, but stopped and turned back towards the west again. We last saw them at about
3:15 heading west. They were a few miles south of Beecher Bay in Canadian waters. More of the story on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

I was with the
J11's, J16's, 17's, and 22's from 1230 to 1415
as they traveled south west
from Victoria to west of Race Rocks
. They had a brief feeding frenzy offshore of Pedder Bay where I was able to collect one scale sample under permit #M.M.L. 001. They started to group up when they got to Race Passage.

We received a call from Chris Henry, a reporter from the Kitsap Sun this morning, telling us about
a whale that was in the Kitsap US Navy shipyard
last night, between two ships; but this morning is gone. WDFW was called last night. Just an alert that this whale is still around.....hoping it stays south, or finds its way out of the sound...
