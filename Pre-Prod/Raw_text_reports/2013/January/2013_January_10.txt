Orca Sightings for January 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted
K pod just south of Fort Bragg CA
, and talked Cal Fish and Game boat in on them in unbelievably rough seas. We had to get them within 200 yards before they could see them. I saw K20, K25 +5 in group. Seas still rough.

Researchers from Naked Whale Research were able to connect with the
K pod
as they traveled through the
Mendocino county
waters. A huge thank you to CA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, Lt. Dennis McKiver for taking us out on patrol vessel "Chinook" in order to collect photo IDs. We confirmed
12 individuals from the 20 that reportedly make up K pod
. Another huge thank you to Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research who guided us right to the whales location via his land-based observation. We left the whales, in tight family groups, still heading south at a very slow pace of 4 knots on their way towards
Bodega Bay
.

We had
J pod heading west off Victoria
today and saw all members of the
J10s, J11s, J16s, and J17s
. We don't believe J2, J8, the J14s, J19s, and L87 were around today.

Out with J
pod southern resident orcas!!! Constance bank
(5-6 miles south of Victoria) in snow flurries!' We arrived at Constance Bank at
1:30pm today. Southern resident J pod was sighted and were really spread out foraging. Weather was cold with snow flurries and large swell was coming in from Juan De Fuca strait. The whales were doing five minute dives and there was an occasional breach. We left the whales at about
2:30pm.

Most amazing and totally unexpected orca encounter. I had just pulled on the ferry when I happened to casually glance over at Brown Island as it was being illuminated by a sunbreak and BAM! Dorsal fins!! I watched
6 to 8 transient orcas weave in and out through boats on mooring buoys IN Friday Harbor and then swim into Shipyard Cove!
They then worked their way back out the east entrance of the harbor where they made a kill! WOW! Something I've never seen in all my years here and my first time ever seeing orcas from the ferry!
