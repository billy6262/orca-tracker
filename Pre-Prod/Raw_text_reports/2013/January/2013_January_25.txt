Today around
noon
we were traveling on our boat from Jones Island to Seattle and saw
Orcas
fishing near
Marrowstone Point/Fish Haven
. They put on a beautiful show for us! A NOAA Research boat showed up about 30 minutes after us and started following the Orcas. We are from Southern California and have our boat in Seattle for the year. I've been checking your site map every time we come up to see were there's been activity in hopes to plan one of our trips were the Orcas have been sighted, today we just lucked out!

Rick Huey of the WA State Ferries called at

9:26 am
to say he saw
three blows and dorsals
off
Port Townsend
, heading south in Admiralty Inlet, mid channel. No idea who it is, but the latest sat tag beep from K 25 has K pod off Moclips on the WA coast, so it's not them.
