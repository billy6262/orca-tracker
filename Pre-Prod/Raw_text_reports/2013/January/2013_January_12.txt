Orca Sightings for January 12, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient killer whales - T65B, T65B1,T49B, T49B2, and T49A2
were spotted at about

1:30
traveling north, close to shore, on the west side of
San Juan Island
. They traveled deep into Open Bay before heading north, along the west side of Henry Island (image attached). They made at least one kill during the time we saw them. We left them at about
4:00pm still heading north, just south of Stuart Island. I'll be posting more images from the encounter on my blog: Whale of a Purpose.

Orca off Neck Point (north of Nanaimo)
. I went for a walk down at Neck Point today and was surprised to see
a pod of several Killer whales
feeding a few hundred yards off the shore. I wish I had the vantage point of the guy in this boat!

Pod of one large, ~3-4 mid-size, ~3 immature
from the deck of our house on
Hammond Bay Road, Nanaimo between Neck Point Park and Shack Islands off Piper's Lagoon
. Sighted today around

1:50 p.m.
The pod was feeding and stayed in the same area, coming to the surface swimming in a small circle, breaching, etc. We have only recently moved to Nanaimo and have not seen Orcas in this area before.

I spotted
3 killer whales around 5PM near Schooner Gulch, south of Pt. Arena CA
last night. Have photos but they were too far for me to ID. Last seen headed west at sunset. These are possibly transients as a grey whale breached next to them in the same area. Hoping to see K pod off the back deck this morning.
