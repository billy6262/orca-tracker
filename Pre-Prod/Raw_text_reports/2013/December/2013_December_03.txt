This is
J37 Hy'Shqa
at
Point Robinson
today, according to Melisa Pinnow. So we had part of J pod with K pod in Puget Sound today, even if we couldn't see them all while they were spread out in the huge waves whipped by ferociously icy winds! - Meg McDonald

10:33 -
Maia of WA State Ferries called to relay a report from a ferry of
a pod of orcas seen from the north end of Vashon Island
, heading south down the east side of Vashon. The number could not be estimated due to wind and waves.
*
At
2:00pm
we watched
four orcas
, including a small one, pass our home on
Totten Inlet
, moving up the bay slowly from north to south, into the inlet. We followed them with binoculars, lots of rolling and spouting, glistening in bright sunlight against a blue sky. We are guessing residents, because they left feeding debris for a large flock of seagulls to clean up. Spectacular. - Dee Morton

3 pm -
about half way down
Totten Inlet
(far south Puget Sound), immediately opposite the entrance to Little Skookum Inlet (Mason County). I don't know of any orca sightings this far down Totten Inlet. I have heard of sightings from Steamboat Island, five miles to the north. The water is only about 40 feet deep. - Anders Price

1:30 -
Just saw
3 Orca
moving at a high rate of speed, heading north,
north of Olympia and South of Hunter Pt.
, on the east side of the Inlet. They looked to be female, judging from the size of the fins. Their may have been a juvenile with them. They were zooming along, crashing through the waves. - keller galvin
