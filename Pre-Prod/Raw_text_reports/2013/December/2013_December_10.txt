Orca Sightings for December 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeanne Hyde and I photographed
a group of eight Ts from shore today as they headed south out of Cattle Pass at about 1515. We saw T35A, T35A1, T35A2, T38A, T75, T75A, T75B, and T75C
and they blew by us in one series of surfacings. Ivan Reiff, who had been out on this group earlier and helped us find them, also reported seeing
another group consisting of the rest of the T38s and T35
but they disappeared. - Dave Ellifrit

Thanks to Captain Hobbes for calling me today about
whales in front of his house in San Juan Channel
. I hurried down to the marina, hopped on the boat and had a lucky winter encounter right in front of Friday Harbor! Transient Orcas in front of our office (red building) heading south in San Juan Channel. - Captain Ivan Reiff

Loads of transients out there today with numerous reports. Report 1:
Transients off San Juan Island
- two groups were sighted this morning. Report 2: VMSA Researcher Russ Nicks was off Sooke BC and spotted
a lone transient off Beachy head heading towards Victoria at
3:00PM
. I am pretty sure from the description it is
T103
. Report 3: San Juan Island whale watching and wildlife tours found about
12 transients off Point Caution. T075As were in the large group
of Ts off Point Caution. - Josh McInnes, University of Victoria
