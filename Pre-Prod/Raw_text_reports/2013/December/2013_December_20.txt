Orca Sightings for December 20, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients (Bigg's whales) - We just saw
orcas swimming east in Port Townsend Bay at
3:40pm
. There were 2, I believe both female. They were swimming slowly, did not appear to be feeding. I have a photo taken outside the Northwest Maritime Center. - Megan

3:15 PM -
We were so excited to see at least
5 orcas off the point of Port Townsend
, headed across the bay. Two were large males. They were moving slowly, it was awesome. They were going toward Marrowstone. - Cherylann Turner
