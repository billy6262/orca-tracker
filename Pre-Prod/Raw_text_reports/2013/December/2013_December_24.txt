Orca Sightings for December 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Coastal orcas - R. Kuehn snapped some great shots of 250-300 CA sea lions as they were porpoising away from
7-10 pursuing killer whales at about 1030
. The pod included one adult male and were last seen heading north slowly off
Sea Ranch, CA (south of Mendocino)
. He did not get any photos of the whales however. We then had two follow up reports that were likely the same group of animals:

2:05PM Killer whales 1.5 miles north of Sail Rock,

1:30-
2:30PM Killer whales off Navigator rocks
and south end of Sea Ranch. Sounds like they were working the area pretty good. - Naked Whale Research
