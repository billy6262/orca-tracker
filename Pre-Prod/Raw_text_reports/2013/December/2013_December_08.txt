Orca Sightings for December 8, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sunday dawned cold and bright, becoming even brighter when the S
outhern Resident orcas passed Point No Point
and headed north up Admiralty Inlet past Whidbey Island. Grace and power merged as they broke the surface breaching, tail-slapping and spy-hopping. Some traveled alone, others in pairs or trios, some grouped together in a spectacular display of family unity, dorsals glinting, vapor from their blows backlit by sunlight as they maintained a steady pace cutting through the quiet water. What a treat on a frosty winter's day! - Sandy Pollard

Orca updates - Kit Turner called at

2:20 pm reporting one male orca a little north of Lagoon Pt
., heading NW; at

2:30 pm
we got reports from Sandra Pollard & Dick Snowberger that they were seeing the
orcas from Ft. Casey
, and Bonnie Gretz called at

2:30 pm
to say she was seeing
at least 4 orcas from Ft. Casey
, heading NW. There is a ship anchored between Admiralty Head & Pt. Townsend laying cable, we have alerted the CG who has relayed the orca reports to the ship to make sure their project will not impact the orcas.

Happy me....
7-9 Orcas off Ft. Casey between
2:15 and
3:15 p.m
, heading north. Nice smooth water, saw a breach, some spy hops, tail slaps...and even heard their blows, faintly, as they were in mid-channel between Ft. Casey and Pt. Townsend....and not nearly as cold as yesterday, though I was layered up!!!! Big Orca smiles!! - Bonnie Gretz
*
Today, from approximately
1400-1445
, I watched
a pod of 6 or seven orcas traveling quite steadily from near the boat ramp at the Coupeville ferry slip
, and later, from near
the lighthouse at Ft. Casey State Park
, as they moved from the north end of Marrowstone Island, moving northward until I could no longer view them, southwest of Ebey's Landing. There was at least one young animal in the group. - Martin Whittaker
*
They went past
south end of Marrowstone Island at about 1 p.m
. - Bob Triggs
*
We watched the orcas from about

12:30 -
1:15 pm as they continued west toward Bush Pt
. They were out too far for IDs, but hopefully we'll have a photo or two, some of the last groups to go by were coming closer to the Whidbey side. We counted
a minimum of 15 orcas
, likely closer to 20, with at least 2 adult males. - Orca Network

From
Point No Point
. The distortion and quality make me cringe but it's a wild orca and any morning spent in the company of wild whales is a good morning. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

10:49 -
I see blows south of point no point, but can't see much else because of the water distortion. - Connie Bickerton
*

10:35 -
from atop bluff in
north Edmonds
I can see (barely)
fins and blows
at about
Eglon
still northbound.

10:00 -
have resighted some still northbound, west of mid channel still
south of Eglon
. Earlier spotted at least a dozen blows. At

9:30
they stalled and started lunge feeding.

9:20 -
can see them out from
Edmonds
due west still moving steadily north. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

9:08 - Large amount of orcas
heading north right now. Just passed
Kingston
. They are in shipping lanes.
At least 8
. Appears to be at least one very young one. Probably same ones we saw heading south yesterday. - Ben Abrahamsen

We just had one report from this morning,
9 am heading north past Pt. Defiance
- it was posted in a thread of reports of the other orcas heading north and Alisa just found it a short time ago - no other reports since. - Orca Network
