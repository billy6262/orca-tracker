I went out in the morning to confirm which killer whales were spotted from shore south of Trial Island. I came across the
K13's
northeast bound
south of Oak Bay
and could see several more animals to the south but conditions wouldn't allow me to get any other ID's. Thanks to George and Gord for initially spotting them. - Mark Malleson
