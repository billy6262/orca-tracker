Orca Sightings for December 5, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the
afternoon
of
December 5th I headed out with a group of adventurers after clearing the morning snow off the seats and we followed up a report of killer whales spotted near Speiden Island. We came across
2 groups of Transients in Boundary Pass
. Many of them were the same individuals we had on
December 2nd along with the
T185's
traveling close by. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

The snow started falling gently at about 9 am, and with no reports of whale activity and limited visibility Skipper Mark hustled out past the breakwater in the afternoon. He headed north towards
Boundary Pass
. After just over an hour of searching Mark found
a massive group of transient killer whales
. Usually these mammal eating whales are in small family groups of 2-5, but sometimes several groups join together. The group Mark found had
15, including the T185s, T75Bs. T38s and the T35s
. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching

Many orcas came through Active Pass, BC
heading south. - Mary Greenwood
