============================================================

Entry 1:
4:17 -
We just saw
orcas swimming by Port Townsend
! A rare December treat. - Sound Experience aboard the Schooner Adventuress.
*

3:28 -
They were headed west, past the shipyard, the last time I saw them... Yep, they're still up there, past the
Port Orchard passenger ferry dock
and the marina,
headed toward Gorst
. I saw one going past my house, but there are at least two of them. I saw two distinct spouts as they passed the shipyard.

2:47 -
There be whales here! (
Between Port Orchard and Manette
) - L Michelle Gardner

2:40 -
Brad Hanson reports
orcas off West Point, just off Elliott Bay
, still slowly heading north in choppy seas.
*

2:17 -
Yeah, on their way past
Fay Bainbridge
! - Sue Surowiec Larkin
*

4:15 pm:
Several Bainbridge Islanders watched them from shore
at Rolling Bay Bluff between 2 & 3 pm
. They were really spread out mid-channel from Elliott Bay north to Fay Bainbridge with 2 males in particular really hanging back, at one point the males did a bit of synchronized breaching. NOAA boat with them periodically.

2:10 - Watching K-Pod from Skiff Point, BI
mid-channel. Helicopter and NOAA with them. - Susan Marie Andersson
*
Pod in Elliot Bay
. Riding the
1:10 ferry today from Bainbridge to Seattle I saw tall dark fins of 3 grouped very tightly with bursts of fanning water. There was one further ahead and East of the group about 30 feet. 90 % sure orcas. My first thought was dolphins but quickly changed with the tall fins and then saw flashes of white near their breaching noses. They swam about 200 feet in front of the ferry headed north towards discovery park. - Chester Bennett
*

2:35 -
Brad Hanson is with at least
K pod
(K25 has been ID'd) about
1.5 miles NW of Alki
, still heading slowly north, very spread out.
*

2:30 -
just watched a second group of
orcas pass discovery park
. This grouping closer to Seattle side than first group

1:54 -
Seeing NOAA boat and splashes from breaching at
discovery park
. Whale Scout in action! - Whitney Neugebauer

*

1:44 - At Manitou Beach
... clear view south. Many spread out around NOAA boat. - Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

1:10 -
I have been watching them from
country club Road on Bainbridge Island

Eagle Harbor

I had the extraordinarily good fortune to have seen a total of about 30 Orcas today, including some that swam right beside and in front on the

11:05am ferry from Vashon to Fauntleroy
! They left "footprints" the entire way. After the boat landed, I watched with my binoculars from the hill above the ferry dock for almost 1/2 an hour as many (15-20 total?) whales slowly cruised by headed North, east of mid-channel. I saw a sleep-line of about 8 individuals! This astounding experience was thanks to Sound Actions Podblasts! Thank you so much Amy Carey and Orca Network for giving me one of the greatest experiences of my life today! - J Felicity Welt

11:45 -
Sweet! from atop
Queen Anne
I can see big boy and smaller dorsals gliding northbound-sightline between southside of
Alki Point
and northside of Vashon. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

11:42 -
There's a group of maybe 5, at least one male just
south of Blake island
still heading north.

11:26 -
I'm watching from
Gatewood Hill
and my best guess is they are right off
Lowman beach
right now. The whales
closer to the west Seattle
side still seem to be going north. Those mid channel turned south.

11:05 -

Lincoln Park
