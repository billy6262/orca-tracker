Orca Sightings for December 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw about
10 - 12 orcas swimming east in Boundary Pass
today,
between Waldron and Saturna Islands
. They were swimming in 2 fairly close groups. First group was very close together with a little one swimming between mature orcas. Second group was spread out with breaching and tail slapping. - Maureen Welton
*
Large group of Transients (8-9) northbound past Turn Point towards Pender Island (
15:30pm).
- John Boyd
*
We had
two large groups of T's in the afternoon in Haro Strait.
I came across the first group
mid strait between Henry and Sidney Island
moving quickly northwest. The other group was shadowing them within a couple of miles to the north east. There was also
a single humpback whale
they passed which I last saw south bound at
Kelp Reef
. Great way to start December! - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
*
My T's today were
T35, 38's, 49's, 75B and C
. - Ken Balcomb
*

4:12 -
they were headed south along
Anderson island
. a big boat went passed and I haven't seen them since.

3:54 -
I'm at
chambers bay
and can see them breathing in between
Anderson island and McNeil
- Alex Fazekas-Boone
*
Five killer whales passed Point Robinson on Maury Island today
. These fast-moving orcas dove deep as they approached the point, and they didn't resurface until they were about a mile past us - Meg McDonald
*
That was so fun! Glad I finally caught up with them, been chasing them all summer & fall! I started at Point Defiance & they were already
past Titlow
by the time I got there. They were really moving. I went to
Sunset Beach Dr
. next. Where I finally caught up with them & saw them feed for a bit. They attracted a large group of Gulls & an Eagle to help them eat. This is the only time I actually saw them, not just their breath, today. Got a few good dives & some tail slapping. Then they were
off again to McNeil/Anderson
. & like Alex I watched them head around the corner towards Longbranch. Maybe they will still be here in the morning! Think I got a shot or 2 with my Telephoto at Chambers. With the Olympics in the background. Ill post if any turn out! - Melissa Bird

1:40 PM - orcas heading south at Salmon Beach, Tacoma Narrows
. - Sarah
*

1:35 -
They regrouped and are headed south down
Tacoma narrows
. They are just north of salmon beach now, very close to shore. I'm watching them from gig harbor side

1:24 -
They're a little more spread out now and seem to be swimming in a circular pattern between
Vashon and pt defiance
. Tail flips, spy hopping. Glorious! Sorry I'm not close enough to get a pic!

1:16 -
Between
pt defiance and Vashon
back and forth

1:15 -
now southerly.

1:14 -
Just surfaced. They are northerly in the
Vashon ferry lane
.

1:08 -
Just northwest of the Crane/tug heading northerly and possibly westerly. - Sarah Jones Whalen
*

12:38 -
Westbound along south end of
Maury Is.
- Jason Cook
*

12:50 -
could see their blows between mid channel yellow buoy and
Pt Defiance ferry
heading southwesterly (so west) will be interesting to see which way they turn once they reach Pt Defiance. I go home now. Been a beautiful day.
Noon update -
turned back to more southerly direction, again more towards
Dash/Brown's Point
as Amy said earlier.

11:45 -
I moved south...they appear to be headed
more westerly
now with sun shimmering on their backs and dorsals.

11:30 -
they've
resumed heading south
, about 1/2 mile out.

11:25 -
they dove underwater
past Pt Robinson
and resurfaced near buoy to south. Alot of surface activity, maybe on a kill? I am watching from bluff above
Des Moines marina
. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

11:40 -
I can see them with binoculars from Ruston Way in Tacoma just
SE of Maury
. - Jason Cook
*

11:33 -
Still headed south towards
dash point and Brown's point
. - Amy Carey
*

11:27 - KWs just passed Pt. Robinson
, unfortunately underwater. Almost certainly transients, have a baby too. A few pix to come but no saddle patches due to angle of approach.

10:29 - 5 KWs just passed Dilworth
on east side of channel. Look like possible transient fins. Still southbound. - Meg McDonald
*

9:41 -
Maia of the WA State Ferries reports about
five orcas south of the Vashon ferry dock
, heading south down the
east side of Vashon Island
.
*
Lucky commuters on the

7:55 Bainbridge Ferry watching a pod of orcas
headed south this morning! Take a break, bundle up and get on out. It's a gorgeous morning! Photo by my husband Ken Bennett. - Susan Marie Andersson
*
FYI.... my husband takes the

7:55 ferry from BI
and just texted that they announced there were
Orcas near the boat
on his way out... near Rockaway Beach... He said he did not see them but thought i would give you guys a heads up... just in case! - Cindy Russel
*
The folks on the Bainbridge ferry just caught a glimpse of
4 or 5 orcas near the island
, on the south side of the boat, offshore between eagle harbor and blakely harbor. It's the
7:55 Seattle to Bainbridge ferry. - Katey Rissi

The
Humpback Whale is still 10 minutes from our dock in Saanich Inlet
. She has been
in the same area for the past 3 weeks
. - Simon Pidcock
