============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out

. They were headed north through Samsun Narrows! What a great experience! - Maureen Phelan

This sighting today
at noon is between Anderson Island and Ketron Island
. Friends of ours were bringing their boat back to Anderson Island from Tacoma today around noon and they were
surrounded by two pods of Killer Whales
that approached their boat on the
East Side of Anderson Island
in an area that the Washington State Department of Natural Resources has designated as a Dump Site for Dredged materials from the an area in the Port of Olympia. The Dumping of (20) Barge Loads or 20 Million Pounds of dredged materials is scheduled to commence this week in the area the Killer Whales were sighted in today. This is an area where three or more Dall's Porpoises are seen the year round. Killer Whales feed on Squid and other marine life and the squid are abundant in this area. Apparently they came right towards the boats and two pods circled and dove beneath the boats. I understand
they counted around (7) Killer Whales
including two small ones with their mothers. I'm up-loading the video that will be posted on the Anderson Islanders Facebook site later this evening very slow process. - Bob Lyden, Anderson Island.
