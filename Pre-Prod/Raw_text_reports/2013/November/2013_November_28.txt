Orca Sightings for November 28, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
SUPER POD swam by and gave the west side of San Juan Island
a Thanksgiving treat.
Members from all 3 pods were present, but not all of L Pod was there
. They headed north
past Kellett bluff around 2-3pm
. Hope they come back down tomorrow when it's daylight! - John Boyd
*
Just an awesome day on the water with
all of J Pod, K Pod and over half of L Pod
. On the way in I picked up
a Humpback in Saanich Inlet
who breached twice while I was just getting on scene unfortunately my camera wasn't out... But after the breach it cartwheeled and was tail lobbing. This Humpback has been in the inlet for over 2 weeks now! - Simon Pidcock
*
Still feeling the high of a superpod - nothing like a whale fix to lift the spirits! Here's
K20 Spock and K44 Ripple.
I wasn't expecting Granny for Thanksgiving! J2 off Lime Kiln Point State Park. - Monika Wieland
