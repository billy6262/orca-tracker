Orca Sightings for November 16, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We left Snug Resort at
12:30 today, thinking we might find the Humpbacks that Simon Pidcock had reported over in the Sanich Inlet. We crossed a rough Haro Strait and headed toward Canada. As we got close to the zone, Jeanne saw the blows! But not huge HB blows. These blows were coming from
Orcas
! Unexpected Orcas! They were
T38A
, the one with the white patch on it's dorsal fin,
T35A and T35A1
. The forth Orca we're not sure about. These Orcas are usually seen in SE Alaska. And we did see Humpbacks as well. - Capt. Jim Maya

2:30 -
We have been watching 4
orcas with one baby in satellite channel
, and also
one humpback
, just south of Salt Spring Island (BC Gulf Islands, just north of the US San Juan Islands). - Karen Gray

At

10:30AM
I was looking out from Beechyhead in
East Sooke park and saw 2 orcas close to Secretary Island
. One male and one smaller one. Later, at

2:50PM they were about 2 miles off Albert head
still moving east. There were
Humpbacks further off shore
at both locations. - Vincenz Eberl
