Orca Sightings for November 27, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Observed
3 Orcas circling the bouy on the N side of Mendocino Bay in Northern California
at about 39.19N Lat They were trying to dislodge sealions by making splashes around the bouy and frequent blowing After about 15 minutes (first observation around noon) they swam south and saw three distinct blows, one from a smaller whale I was about a block away when I saw the show. I spent 25 years as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have seen many orcas before, but this was the first sighting I made in 13 years here on the Cal Coast. - Alan Stein

Thanks to reports on Orca Network's fb page, I watched
8-10 orca
(presumed to be Transients) travel
from the north end of Marrowstone Island to north of Point Wilson
.... pretty much out of sight by

3:40pm
. Was unable to post on fb from Fort Casey. They were too far away for ID's. Lots of Steller sea lions "people watching" at Fort Casey. - Jill Hein
