Orca Sightings for November 19, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We traveled
past Race Rocks, where we encountered not one, not two, but EIGHT humpback whales
, all within a kilometer of each other. They were traveling in groups of two and all stayed very close to the surface. After half an hour, the playing began. One group of two started splashing about and waving their pectoral fins at us. Shortly afterwards, we witnessed 2 full breaches in another group. That whale then began tail slapping loudly. Next, the most remarkable thing happened --
these two groups of whales joined together
, and started traveling perfectly in unison, all surfacing at the same time. Prince of Whales Whale Watch
