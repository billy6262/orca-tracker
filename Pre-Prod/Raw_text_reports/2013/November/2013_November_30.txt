Family of orcas off south side of Stuart Island midday Saturday. Five or six, including at least one baby. Headed toward Spieden Channel. - Tad Sooter

3:07 - Off Cattle Point now
. Just left them.
I go up and ask Carl what he has
off Friday Harbor
, I'm going there" A little while later we get there and up pop 3 Orca. I'm happy. Then suddenly there are 5 more behind them. Then suddenly there are 4 more and then several on the other side of the boat including one that breaches right next to us. Now I know,
it's Residents
. Then suddenly they are everywhere. - James Gresham

We finished off November with another great day on the water. I received a report of killer whales off of Friday Harbor mid day. Thanks Hobbes! They turned out to be
members of J, K, and L pod heading south down San Juan Channel.
We watched them exit Middle Channel with a frenzy of breaching and cartwheels before they
fanned out in Haro Strait on a southerly line for Admiralty Inlet
. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
