Do you sometimes eat your dinner too quickly? Are you looking for a sure-fire way to slow down? My wife Lynn and I have discovered the perfect solution. We have discovered the perfect solution. In the middle of dinner yesterday evening, I saw something out of the corner of my eye -
a humpback in Georgeson Bay (Active Pass)!
We put down our forks and knives and quickly wandered down to the shoreline to watch this magnificent creature surfacing a half dozen times. Although we often get orcas coming through, this is only the second time in 15 years that we have seen a large whale in our lovely little bay. The photos hardly capture the majesty of the event. - Peter Reiner, Galiano Island
