Orca Sightings for September 9, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today, we had
J's and K's at Sand Head
s (mouth of the Fraser River) heading south. LOTS of foraging and then they all came together and started showing off! Beautiful couple of days. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
Members of our
resident pods, J and K
, were spotted just off of the
Coal Docks
(north end of Rosario Strait). Alongside these two pods we also saw
L87
, an odd orca named Onyx, who was adopted by K pod after his mother passed away back in 2005. These orca were breaching, spy-hopping, porpoising, feeding and foraging. Shortly after this we found another group of orca near Sidney, BC. This time it was transient orca. We are so lucky to have such a diverse variety of wildlife available for our viewing. - Jessica, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Brook McFeeney called in a report of
3 to 4 (unidentified) groups of orcas
off Powell River (NE Georgia Strait),
15 to 20 total
, headed south toward Lund at about

4:30
this afternoon.

The
T137s, 36As, 37Bs, north of Stuart Island
, San Juan Islands, this morning, from

11:00-
12:30

The
T137's, T036A's, and T037B's
along the shoreline of
Stuart Island
. - Mark Malleson

4:30 -
Sitting on the beach at
West Beach Resort
(west side of Orcas Island): A somewhat large group of orcas (
maybe 10-15?
) just passed through Presidents Channel, heading north! Too far off the shore to determine if resident or transient. - Renee Ramirez
Traci Walter: Transients!

Another whale sighting today! My husband, Corey, was out in Carr Inlet at about

5:30 p.m.
tonight in his kayak. He saw what he thinks was a gray whale
[other reports indicate this was probably a humpback]
about a half mile from
McNeil Island
, headed toward Henderson Bay. He saw the whale surface several more times near the head of the bay over an approximate 45 to 60 minute period. - Mary Ann McCool, Fox Island
