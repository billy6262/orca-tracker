Out on a commercial whale watching trip yesterday. Encountered a super pod of
J, K and L
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca heading west
, between Port Angeles and Victoria. Must of been
60 whales or more
. They were moving fairly quickly, but did see some tail slapping, breaching and pectoral rolls. It was awesome! - Anne Burrell-Smith

Report from Melisa Pinnow came in that
three groups of transients were sighted at Gooch Island
today. The transients turned out to be the
T109s, T012A and T041s
. We are especially excited because
T041s had a new calf
we reported 2 months ago, and the calf seems to be doing well. - Josh McInnes

This week has been one of the best ones ever and today was no exception!
T12A, T41's and T109A's around Portland Island
(about 8 miles NW of Stuart Island). They swam from reef to reef picking off seals and showing their little ones how it was done.
T41A had a new little one with her
, it looked a little thin. Hopefully, it will be alright. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
