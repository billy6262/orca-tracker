Orca Sightings for September 1, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had an incredible day on the water!
Minke Whale, Humpback Whale, and Bigg's (Marine mammal eating) Killer Whales!
We were with the Humpback Whale, when a bait ball formed in front of him. The birds suddenly launched and the Humpback came up almost in a spy hop maneuver with his
mouth wide open
. I've never seen a feeding Humpback in the area, this was so cool to see!!! - Traci Walter
