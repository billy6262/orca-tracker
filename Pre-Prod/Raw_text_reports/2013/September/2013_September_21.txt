Entry 1:
Whales got timing - and my ED and others were thrilled.
Most of L pod and K pod were in Puget Sound

Amazing day on the water with
Southern residents K pod and L pod in Puget Sound.

We saw
whales on the ferry between Seattle and Bainbridge Island
in the afternoon. Not only is it great to see the whales, it is such a communal experience on the ferry. People put down their ipads and phones and go out on deck and with 5, 50 or 75 others, everyone is excited. - Jane Allan
