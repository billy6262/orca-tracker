Orca Sightings for September 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Happy to report a happy pod (or two or?) BC Ferry Spirit of Vancouver Island passed
a large group of our SRKWs on the
19:00
run from Victoria to Vancouver.
19:30 they were headed north,
west side of N. Pender Island
in the general direction towards Active Pass. Someone commented they had counted 20, likely there were more. The pod was spread widely, in 2's, 3's and several larger groups. They seemed pretty relaxed and sadly we passed them quickly (darned ferry schedules anyways!). There were several breaches and some tail slaps, and it looked like social time. Unfortunately, we were a bit far for any possible IDs. - Paul C, Vancouver
