Orca Sightings for September 7, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have gone through the photos and those
whales off Tofino on Sat
where not from California. They are
Northern Resident B1 Pod, A Clan, B7
Mat. I think the floppy dorsal fin had the drivers excited!
B13 has a collapsed fin and B10 could be the warped one
. Still waiting on pics. - Jennifer, The Whale Center
*
12 miles SW of Cleland Island, off Tofino
, we here at Jamie's Whaling Station were in the company of 6 orcas. One male in the group has a completely collapsed dorsal fin draped over his back on his left side, and the other male has what looks like a bulge or a growth within his mid-dorsal fin on his left side. We followed them through a breaching mother calf pair of humpbacks, as they ventured west into the vast Pacific Ocean! Claire Mosley
This is excellent! We were wondering where the Bs were. I can ID
B7, B10 and B13
in these shots and look forward to the rest. - Jared Towers
