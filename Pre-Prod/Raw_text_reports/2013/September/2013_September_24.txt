Orca Sightings for September 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:00 PM - Pods of Orcas
were travelling east near shore north of
Freshwater Bay along north shore of the Olympic Peninsula
. I was fishing from a kayak 2 miles north of Observatory Point, Freshwater Bay. Several Groups of Orcas passed between me and shore travelling east from Salt Creek to Angeles Point. Two groups of whales following about 1/2 mile apart. Then two larger whales passing closer to my boat. Some were breaching. The groups were very tight. One photo shows 7 fins and one blow hole in close proximity. I kept my distance, but 2 passed within 25 yards of my kayak. I stopped moving upon sighting of the whales. - Dan Kuwitzky
