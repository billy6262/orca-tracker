Orca Sightings for September 14, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Spent about a half hour with private
whales off Williamson Rocks and Allan Island before they vanished in Allan Pass
(NW of Anacortes). There were 4 of what I perceived to be transients: an adult male with a slightly floppy dorsal fin, an adult male with a straight dorsal, an adult female, and a sprouter. The two younger whales split off to play in a kelp bed off Allan Is, then treated us to a tandem breach! I've never seen that happen before. They continued to have boisterous play behavior, breaching, motor-boating, and peeking around above water in the kelp whilst the grown-ups were more serious off the shore (right next to our kayaks). - Mira Lutz

Whales, whales, whales... Rolling and playing, breaching and cartwheeling, milling, socializing, foraging and finding salmon, it was all happening near
Pt. Roberts
on Saturday afternoon. So good to see the southern residents relaxed and mellow (as Tasli Shaw mentioned in her
September 13 report), an especially heartening sight considering their absence this summer and heightened concerns about their welfare. There were few boats on scene, contributing to a quiet and peaceful encounter with the whales as the fog lifted over a calm, glassy sea. A truly special day for passengers on "Mystic Sea". - Sandra Pollard, Whidbey Island

We spotted the same group of resident killer whales that have been spotted off the
Vancouver
mainland throughout the week. Naturalist Karen identified the group as
L-pod
; one way to identify a group is by spotting a familiar whale--such as she did today, with the large male,
L88 "Wave Walker"
. There were other large males in the group being very active; with spy hops, breaching, and tail slaps! - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

J, K, L pods way up north by Point Roberts
. Amazing spy hops and breaches! This was my first time seeing orcas in the wild and it makes me super emotional...a very happy emotional. - Jamie Grundhauser

The T
-10 Transient Orcas
came all the into
Victoria's Inner Harbour
today, around

2:30 pm
. - Claire Rogers

T041A and T041A2
were traveling along the shoreline of
Saltspring Island
. - Mark Malleson

On the
Victoria
side of things, we had
transient killer whales that ventured right into Victoria harbour!
Early yesterday morning our Skippers Mark and Bo found the whales, known as the
T10s
, as they were traveling along the shoreline of
Beecher Bay in Sooke
. We met up with the whales near Albert Head as they continued to swim East towards Victoria.
By
3:00pm, the whales were at the breakwater to the harbour
, and minutes later were right in
Victoria Harbour
at the famous Fisherman's Wharf! They then made their way towards
Race Rocks
. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

Less than two weeks after their last visit, the
TO10's
were at it again today as they visited
both Victoria Harbour and Esquimalt Harbour:)
The three Transient Orcas that make up this pod,
T010 a female born in 1963, and her 2 sons TO10B (born in 1983 and TO10C (born in 1999)
were first picked up in the fog west of Race Rocks this morning and made their way towards Victoria during the morning. - Andrew Lees

My son just came home from fishing, and told me he saw
2 orca's off Possession Bar (S end of Whidbey)
around

1:30 or 2pm
. He saw them come up once, and they disappeared. - Connie Bickerton

Colvos passage
, not sure if
orca or dolphin
heading north. Looks like only one. - Donna DiGiacomo Green
