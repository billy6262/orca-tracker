Orca Sightings for September 6, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A man called and left a message about an
orca sighting just NW of Gold Beach, OR
, about 7 miles out. He reported seeing 1 male, 3 females and 1 juvenile orca, no direction of travel given.

It was back to the residents today! A mish mash of
J's K's and L's around Sand Heads
at the south arm of the Fraser river. They were just milling in that area in a big resting group. It was pretty awesome! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
So exciting to observe
approx 12 Orcas travelling past Point Roberts at
5:30
today. Moving quickly they headed north. Two large males swam with the group and there was one calf travelling with two females. Some tail lobbing and back swimming. - Sandra Scott
*
Dozens of orcas
swimming, travelling and playing, heading east up
Boundary Pass
along south Pender Island between
2-2.30pm
. Baby/Junior jumping for joy straight up out of the water repeatedly. - Jennifer Conkie
*
Despite the fog, we came across a large collection of
Resident Orcas close to San Juan Island
. They were quickly identified as a mixture of
J, K, and L pod
. Our later trips continued to watch the Residents at Turn Point, at the north end of Stuart Island and all the way into the Georgia Strait. - Claire Butterfield, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
