Orca Sightings for September 29, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Rescuers save humpback from a tangle of ropes. When whale watchers found
Foggy
, about
1 p.m
., the
humpback
had rope wrapped around her head and across her blowholes, and around her peduncle (the narrow part of her tail, just ahead of the flukes) and was dragging a mass of old lobster traps beneath her. The whale disentanglement crew from Campobello Island freed Foggy from a tangle of ropes and gear. Grommet never left the side of Foggy, a humpback whale entangled in fishing gear, and the instant rescuers cut the ropes from Foggy, Grommet breached.

Now it's becoming more
orca
like. Maybe the distance is making them sound more like dolphins. Should be around Constance Bank, based on the report from when they were off Race Rocks.

I am starting to pick up some faint
vocals on LK
, but they don't sounds quite like orcas to me... Can anyone else hear this? - Marcie Callewaert
