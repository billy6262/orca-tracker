The season is getting better everyday. We caught up with most of the
Southern Resident Orca population in Boundary Pass
today. They were in huge resting groups, slowly moving along the rocky shoreline of Saturna Island. More fins than you could count, all at the surface in tight groups. We moved slowly along with them until they reached East Point, at which time they started to wake up, spread out, and pick up speed as the backdrop changed to open water and mountain tops. I love September! - Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watching
