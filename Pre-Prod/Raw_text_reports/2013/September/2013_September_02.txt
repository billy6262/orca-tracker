Orca Sightings for September 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas spotted near
Oman
. 15degN 054degE Around 110 miles from
Oman (SE of Saudi Arabia)
. The sea at the time for around a 10 mile stretch was green with blooms of algae. I work on board oil tankers and often see dolphins. I spotted (and I am 100% positive) some Orca whales. I thought it was most unusual given the location. Is it usual to see killer whales this far north?? - Tony Bruce

Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida
, just south of Jacksonville, who was out paddleboarding Sept. 2, when
an orca came up three feet (3') in front of him
. He said the dorsal fin was about four feet tall. He was 85% sure it was an orca.
