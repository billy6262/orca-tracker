Orca Sightings for October 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our local waters are a hopping hangout for humpback whales right now! This time of year, humpbacks gather in large numbers to feed in the Southern water of the Strait of Georgia - eating as much as they can before the long journey back down south to warmer tropical waters. Today
we saw a whopping nine humpbacks
! The water conditions were incredible, flat and calm. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Gray whale
is back and at the same place as yesterday - slowly moving back and forth along the sand spit at C
ooper Point on the Eld Inlet side
. It eventually went down Eld a small ways, very near show and then came back to the northern end of the spit. It has since headed down the Budd Inlet side, again, very near shore. - Kim Merriman

Minke whales Just crossed the
Hood Canal bridge at
9:45am
. Spotted
a whale
surfacing just off the north side of the bridge headed east towards Salisbury Point Park. The whale is almost black in color with a small dorsal. - Jen Walters
This sounds like a minke, or possibly a humpback.
