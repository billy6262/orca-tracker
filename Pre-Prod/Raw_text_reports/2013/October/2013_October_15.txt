3 pm - the CA Transients
seem to have turned around (now heading back out the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
), but
T20-21 are still coming down Haro Strait
, over by Mandarte Is. now.
*
Orcas in the wild, traveling side by side with family, for life. This is the way of the wild Killer Whale.
T21 "Pandora"
has the smaller dorsal fin on the left. T20 "Kwatsi" has the very tall dorsal fin on the left. These adult male dosral fins can get up to 6 feet tall! It is thought that Pandora was born around 1952 (61yrs) and Kwastsi around 1963 (50yrs). Today on the northwest side of San Juan Island, WA. - Traci Walter, Western Prince Whale Watching

, their offspring, and perhaps a few others were sighted by Jeff Lamarche on Eagle Wings Whale Watching Tours near Race Rocks. - Alisa Schulman-Janiger

So that's where
T20/21
went! They were last seen in Bute Inlet (Campbell River) with the 002C's 4 days ago now I think it was. We had a spectacular encounter with the 002C's yesterday. They took a Harbour Porpoise in Cordero Channel when we were with them. Very graphic, even recovered lungs and heart floating intact. They are so very efficient the 002C's.....some of the best hunters. - Nick Templeman
