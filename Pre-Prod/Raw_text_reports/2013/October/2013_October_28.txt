Orca Sightings for October 28, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw
a large pod of Orcas on the east side of Whidbey Island
. I have a home near the point of
Fox Spit. At
9:30am
, I saw a large Orca completely breach just off the point. Then watched about
30-40 more parade up Saratoga Passage
, heading north, for about an hour. Adults and young whales - a couple of the young ones playfully breached as they went along. Amazing to see. - Troy Carlson
*
T123A was east bound south east of Race Rocks in the morning.
- Mark Malleson
*
Faint
SRKW calls (J pod)
began several minutes ago on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
, but I had to wait until the ferry left to confirm what I was hearing. - Meg McDonald
*
Watching orcas from Baby Island to the Clinton Ferry terminal
, followed them for around 13 miles...beautiful day and wonderful people I met along the way. Best show was when the orcas were near the ferry terminal and hugging Columbia Beach. Lots of excited folks...and ferry personnel too happy day for all. The 4 and
4:30 boat runs had the most excitement. You could hear people screaming from ferry and land! - Marilyn Armbruster
*

5:54 -
We just left the whales swimming off toward the sunset, looks like they were going to head out Admiralty Inlet. - Orca Network
*

5:49 -
Maybe
headed towards Hansville
now. I had a nice breach after my last message. As we birders say it was a "lifer" for me, ending a 30 year streak.

5:41 -
I am at Hines Warf Park north of Edmonds and seeing very distant whales along the west side of Whidbey, headed northish. - Josh Adams
*

5:10 -
Alice Lindahl saw
lots of orcas passing Possession Point
in a long procession of small groups, many breaching over and over.
*
John Crawford of Glendale, south of Clinton, called at

5:10 pm to report 2 large bulls heading south, at Possession Bait
(near Possession Point Park).
*

5:45 -
from atop a high bluff in
north Edmonds
I saw what appeared to be much porpoising. I thought Admiralty too...glad to know you were there with them.

5:00 -
Pam Ren and I watched them approach
Possession Point
traveling very close to Whidbey, some hugging shoreline. Blows lighting up against the dark waters of the Sound and Whidbey. I am going to move south to try and see which way they go. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

5:03 -
The whales are just passing
possession point
now. They are close to the whidbey side and moving pretty quick exhibiting foraging behavior. Looks like they are going to round the tip of the island maybe. - Nicole Woltersdorf

ferry to Clinton
-just saw them! - Lyn Gray

reporting a Superpod off
Columbia Beach near Clinton
, heading south. Spectacular!
*

4:30 -
We live on
Columbia Beach on Whidbey Island
and watched a large
(at least 20) pod of Orcas
going south past our home this afternoon. They were spread out across the water from our buoy line into the ferry lanes and beyond and seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely - one even breaching into the air and putting on quite a show. They were absolutely spectacular! - Lynne Malecki
*

4:25 -
just watched at least
a dozen Orcas
pass by my house across from
Hat Island in Clinton

HUGE pod

Mukilteo ferry crossing
. - Melanie J. Sceva Hill

Orcas just passed Langley Marina
heading towards Sandy Point. Had a few breaches. Good show. - Ed Young

3:20 -
A loose pod of
orcas cruised south down the middle of Saratoga Passage
at about

3:20 PM

There is a large pod of orcas
between Camano Island and Whidbey Island
. They are closer to the east side of Whidbey Island. I live on Camano Island above the beach at Camp Comfort/Indian Beach area. There is also a boat following them way too close. They seem to be heading in the direction of Camano Island State Park (going South). - Pete Moe
*
12 noon -
Are there only 4? They appear to be congregated -- and this is an educated guess given the distance from my home --
off Snakelum Point
...give or take...or to say it another way, they appear to be a couple of miles south of Coupeville.

11:10 -
Just spotted them west off
Cama beach
. They are spread out. Very exciting! - Steve Rothboeck

Just sighted a pod of about
8 to 12 Orca whales
including two young juvenile orcas. The pod was traveling north in
Saratoga Passage
. We saw them pass
East Point at about
9:45am
this morning' They appeared to linger in the current back eddy of East Point to feed before continuing north. One individual breached about 75 yards north of East Point. - George Cook
*

9:40 -
Dodie Markey called from
Mabana Beach, Camano Island
to say she's watching many orcas in Saratoga Passage, foraging, heading both north and south.

About

9:30 AM
, several orca were spotted a few hundred yards off the eastern shore of
Whidbey Island just south of Fox Spit in Saratoga Passage
. The orca were moving slowly north along the shore and appeared to be feeding. Several remained in the area for over 20 minutes. Further south, in mid-Passage, a few other orca were also observed. - Steve Runo
