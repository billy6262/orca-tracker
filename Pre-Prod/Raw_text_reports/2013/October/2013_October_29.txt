Orca Sightings for October 29, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today was one of the best Orca watching days of the 25 years living in the Great Pacific Northwest! During four hours from our little neighborhood park we watched the
J & K pods spread out over a 1/2 mile
. Probably over 40 Orcas feeding and breaching in the warm sunshine!!!! A very sweet and happy bunch! The Orcas filled everyone's heart with joy! And even closer we watched 30 passing porpoises and a few seals and 100's of sea birds and also several salmon jumping out of the water. All with the Olympic Mountain range in full view! People were lined up at our spotting scope. Many were excited Orca virgins. . Always the best!! YAY! - at Carkeek Park. - Kenny Hamm

nearing Kingston

Saw about
5 or 6 on the Kingston side
. Very far from us over here on the Edmonds side but I still am happy to have seen them thanks to a few others with binoculars who pointed them out. - Kellie Sagen

From north
Richmond Beach
late this afternoon into evening I watched
J & K pod
travel northward very spread out and in small groups. Saw a few breaches and tail lobs as they continued their steady journey northward mostly west of mid channel. A few whales (including one of the big boys) swam mid way between me and mid channel, stalled and foraged for 10 minutes. A boat packed with burly fishermen motoring south erupted in celebration and cut their engine once aware of the orcas in their presence. A big boy surfaced and another spy-hopped near their boat eliciting more cheers, all of us happy to be absorbing these creatures swimming beside them. The orcas and the setting sun behind my beloved Olympic mountains fills my being. Days like these.... - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Willie Wilson, 2nd mate on the ferry Tacoma, called to report a large pod of
at least 20 orcas about .5 - 1 mile off Restoration Point
, heading north. The males were on the perimeter of the group, females and younger orcas inside the group. A lot of breaching going on, and a lot of happy passengers on the ferries that are slowing and stopping to watch the whales go by!
*
What a perfect West Seattle day! We got to watch the
orcas swim south to about the south end of Blake Island
before they turned back north. Lots of tail slapping and breaches. Here are a couple of photos - my favorite is the first, of an orca just finishing a backflip - a moment later all you could see was a huge splash! - Trileigh Tucker

This morning I counted approx
16 Orca
traveling south at speed. They were led by two large males, followed at varying speeds by the rest. Last to pass was a female and a smaller possible calf. I live on high bank waterfront on the
East Side of Bainbridge Island, between Yomalt Point and Wing Point/ Murden Cove
, and the entrance to Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island. East Side of the Island directly facing Seattle downtown. - Sally Sieber

.i am atop bluff north end of
Richmond Beach Park
, can see what I believe is activity south of Faye Bainbridge Park, sightline midway between that and Eagle Harbor (Bainbridge ferry)..if you transect they're out there somewhere in middle. Please keep in mind that's with a healthy dose of long distance viewing. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Heads up to everyone on the
Bainbridge/Seattle ferrries
. A large pod moving south in the middle of the sound
just off President Point in Kingston
. Can see the spouts with my naked eye but best viewed thru binoculars. - Chris Beamer Otterson

Looks like the SRKWs might be back in Puget Sound this morning. My neighbor Larry walked up and rang my doorbell to tell me he was seeing some dorsal fins out there. Sure enough I grabbed my binoculars and am seeing a number of dorsal fins of Richmond Beach / Shoreline, spread out between south of the mid-channel buoy down to 1-2 miles off
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.
Hopefully you can get the word out so central and south Sound folks can be ready! - Dave Haas
*
Spotted
a small female orca with playful calf
, flipping it's tail half out of water repeatedly. Seemed solo which struck me as odd. . I believe there was a feeding event before we came on the scene as the animals were located because of a flock of sea gulls not unlike a shark attack or sea lion feeding event, we slowed the boat and went neutral for a moment maintaining our distance, animals were headed south.
Lat 38,50, 30ftms between Saunders reef and Anchor Bay Nor Cal.
I am a commercial urchin diver, on my boat with thousands of hrs time in this area, first sighting here although I've had several off Pt Arena, always pods though. - Erik Owen

An urchin fisherman spotted
3 killer whales, including a calf yesterday at ~
2:30PM, 1 mile NW of Haven's Anchorage, Gualala, CA
. Coordinates were 38 48.304N, 123 36.771W. Animals were possibly harassing seals and were non-directional. No photos were submitted. - Naked Whale Research

23 humpbacks
were seen in our area,
most of them west of Race Rocks
. Orcas were seen late of the West Side, some NE of Orcas Island, and some going west way west of Victoria...- James Mead Maya
