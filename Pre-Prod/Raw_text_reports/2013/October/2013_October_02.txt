Orca Sightings for October 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We noticed that the
Humpback
s were producing a high pitch noise during exhalation referred to as "trumpeting." Trumpeting is thought to occur when Humpbacks are stressed or anxious. Even though the Southern Resident Orcas only consume fish and will not prey on these large whales, it doesn't mean that the Humpbacks are not going to be a little on the nervous side! - Kevin Culmback

9 am - Orcas
just spotted at the end of
Old Farm Rd. San Juan Island
...No direction yet. At

8:20 this morning
I got the call from a former passenger who told me that she and her husband had just seen a couple of
Orcas near Eagle Pt., San Juan Island
, going up island. By the end of the day those two Orcas had turned into the Super Pod, and...and...five Humpbacks! Another OK day! We left the HBs going north and the Rezzies going south at Lime Kiln Light. - Capt. Jim Maya

This morning there were so many whales around that Skipper Rush had to choose whether to check out
three humpbacks
reported in the area, or go to see the
resident killer whales
. The residents turned out to be our two largest pods
J pod and L pod
. That's at least 62 whales! They socialized and enjoyed each other's company off San Juan Island. The afternoon tour was lucky enough to see a humpback whale swimming almost side by side with the resident killer whales! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
I saw
members of all 3 pods
today, and
3 humpbacks off the west side
. 2 of which we're traveling very close to the residents. Very cool out there today. - Traci Walter

Also in the Salish Sea today:
Five humpbacks near False Bay on San Juan Island
, and
minke whales
in various locations including
San Juan Channel
. - Brittany Helen

2:40 pm - Gray
spotted off of
Dash Point
pier (just north of Commencement Bay, Tacoma), headed south. - Robin Mann
