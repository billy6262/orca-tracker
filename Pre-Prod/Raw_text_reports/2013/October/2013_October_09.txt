Orca Sightings for October 9, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:26 pm - Gray whale
is still here. Same place......moving slowly (with shallow surfacing) back and forth along the west side of Cooper Point spit.

7:00 am -
I just watched this whale doing many slow surfacing series back and forth in the mouth of
Eld Inlet, right at the tip of Cooper Point
. It hung around for at least 30 minutes - or at least that's how long I was able to watch it once I noticed it. I have since lost track of it. - Kim Merriman
*
Humpback
sightings continued in abundance today. According to our zodiac skipper Rush, "there was practically a humpback superpod". With
up to fifteen of them
in our local waters, no matter which direction you looked - you could see the blow of whales. One zodiac tour watched in awe as two humpbacks swam near them in a resting formation in smooth, glassy calm waters. What a beautiful sight to see! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
