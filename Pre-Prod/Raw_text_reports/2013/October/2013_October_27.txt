Entry 1:
Mid Channel Buoy directly across from

12:30 -
First time on my pleasure craft seeing killer whales! We were just
south of Point no Point
we found ourselves forced to kill the motor and wait for the 15-20 whales to pass us leaving some great photos. A great supprise for a windy day! - Larry Dallmann

12:13 -
There are several (least one male) just north of the ferry, which has turned presumably to give them space. - Kate Stovel

From
10-
10:30 AM a pod of 20-25 Orcas
slowly worked their way south past
Point-No-Point
. The north wind had picked up,the tide was coming in strongly-the group gave the impression of riding the wind and tide. One of the larger adults breached-coming almost completely out tof the water. The first eight individuals were about 1/2 mile offshore. The balance of the Pod passed only about 1/4 mile offshore. - Steve Giles
*
Here are some photos I took this morning from shore at
Pt. No Point
. We saw lots of blows mid-channel when I first arrived

10:30
. I'm pretty sure I saw Samish J14 and her crew along with many others (but it was hard to say with the chop). Then we had a mixed group come by about 10 minutes later right off shore (from 50-100 yards). I saw the J22s for sure, J27, J39, and J16 and crew. Also pretty sure L92 was there (it's hard to miss that dorsal of his!) and also I'm pretty sure K16 and K35. They were all moving south at a fast clip. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu
I see J14, J26, J27, J34, J35, J38, J39, J40, K14, K16, and maybe L106 (behind J39 in one of the two pics he's in) in those eleven photos. Looks like a good day to be taking pictures from shore! -Dave Ellifrit
*

9:57 am -
A lot of splashing and action off
Foulweather Bluff
, south side of Hood Canal entrance - must be finding some salmon!

9:40 - Orcas are very spread out - leaders are nearing
Pt. No Point, Kitsap Peninsula
, and we're still seeing more just south of the south end of Marrowstone Island - all still heading south, LARGE group of Residents!

9:30 - we're seeing the orcas heading south, just south of
Bush Pt, west Whidbey Island
!

9:25 - Visual confirmation from Orca Network. We see them now, spread out across Admiralty Inlet between Bush Point and Point No Point, heading south. - Susan Berta
*

9:20 -
Justine Buckmaster on the Victoria Clipper reports seeing
a large number of orcas off Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, heading south, ID'd as
J's, K's and L's.
*

9:15 -
A number of orcas are going south past
Bush Point.
They are just south of the buoy, closer to marrowstone island than bush point. The victoria clipper has stopped to watch them. - Alex de Soto, Bush Point
*

8:15 am -
Benye Weber relayed a report from her husband John who saw
orcas
from the
Coupeville/Port Townsend ferry
.
*

7:30-

7:40 -
heard what I thought were
SRKWs on Port Townsend hydrophone!
My volume was down when the loudest call came through, then ferry noise. The vocals of whatever animal (s) continued but were so faint. All SRKWs were reported in Sooke yesterday and from pictures at least some appear to be heading away from the sunset . Keep your eyes on Admiralty Inlet. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
Humpback whales - 5 individuals (2 were juveniles), entrance to Beecher Bay BC.
Moving in circles - staying in the same general location. Sighted
between 1100 and 1300
. Appeared to be resting and travelling slowly. Whales have been sighted here previously. Too far away for IDs or photos. - Dave Tyre
*
But we did match our previous record for
humpback
sightings!!! Mark set out at a full boat at
10am
in search of humpbacks and he didn't have to go far. These whales have been loving the areas
between Victoria and Sooke
. That gives us lots of time with the animals, but also time to find more! All in all we spotted
17 humpbacks again today
. The humpbacks in this area typically spend the summer here, instead of going all the way to the Alaskan feeding grounds frequented by most humpbacks in the North Pacific. Most of the whales we've been seeing recently have been the migratory ones, so not ones we recognize. This just makes the numbers more impressive, because that's not including our "resident" bunch. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
