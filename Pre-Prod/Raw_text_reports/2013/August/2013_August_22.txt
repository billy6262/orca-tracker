Orca Sightings for August 22, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Resident superpod Thursday evening in the Strait of Juan de Fuca near Victoria, B.C.
- Gayle Swigart

Aboard a friend's boat in the evening we met up with a
very, very spread out superpod in the middle of Haro Strait offshore of False Bay around
7:15 PM
. In our time out there we saw the
L47s, J22s, and K12s. J32
. After initially heading east they eventually all turned to the south and we followed our group of them to about Eagle Point where we left them still heading south at
8 PM
. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
*
Both Mark and our
12:15 Ocean Magic boat arrived on scene with a group of
50 resident orcas
! The large group had
members of all 3 pods present
, although was not a full "super pod"- which is when all 82 whales are present. One familiar whale spotted today was J2, "Granny", who usually is seen leading the J pod group; she is believed to be an astounding 102 years old! - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
All three of the pods scooted into the area. What a spectacular evening! Flat calm waters and whales everywhere. And a nice sunset to round everything out. Evening encounters are my favorites. - Katie Jones
*
Groups
spread out over a mile, sometimes all of them in view at the same time. At one point the group in front of us stalled on the surface, a few spy hops and shuffling, then all of a sudden they were all swimming together in a different direction. Pretty cool. - Jeff Friedman
*
This morning our Victoria departures went east out of Victoria harbour and along San Juan Island past
Friday Harbour, where there was a group of transient orcas
! As the whales travelled around the north end of the island, our trips followed this active group of whales, who were spy hopping and tail slapping! They spotted the
T30, T36, and T37 matrilines
, making up
15 whales
in total. Our Vancouver Ocean Magic encountered
a young humpback whale in Georgia Strait
who displayed breaches, tail flicks, waved his pectoral fins, and even lay on his back showing off his underside on the surface. They then cruised on to
Spieden Channel,
where they spent time with the group of
15 transient orcas
we found earlier in the morning! Skipper Mark came across a group of 6 transients near Race Rocks, believed to be the T60 matriline. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*

5:30 pm - Orcas
1 mile straight out from
Golden Gardens (Seattle)
.
3 or more Orcas
swimming around as I paddle boarded the area. They swam nearby for an hour before I had to head in. No big male. - Kathy Greisen
*
We spotted
3 orcas off the Dungeness Spit at
5:20 PM
, in the area right off the bottom of the trail. They appeared to be following the river current, possibly eating fish off the river? They were traveling towards the lighthouse. - Karyn McCracken
