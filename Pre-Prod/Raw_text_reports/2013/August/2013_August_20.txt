Orca Sightings for August 20, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Don McCall called this afternoon about seeing
a small number of orcas at 7 pm
for about 40 minutes, between
Shi Shi Beach and Point of Arches
, west coast of Olympic National Forest. He saw at least three blows and one male dorsal fin. He estimated the coordinates at 40 15.7 by 124 41.5.

My husband and I live on the south side of
Fox Island (lower Puget Sound)
. This morning at approximately

7:00 a.m.
, we saw and heard
two Minke whales
(we figured out from pictures & description on the Internet) surfacing, blowing out air and diving for about seven minutes between surfacing. We at first thought they were orcas, but figured out the dorsal fins were much too small for an orca. They were moving along at a pretty good clip about 250 feet off shore. They were headed toward Hale's Passage. We have not seen whales back here before, but we've only been here for about 15 months. - Mary Ann & Corey McCool
Note: a pair of humpbacks have been recently seen in south Puget Sound, and a pair of Risso's dolphins have been seen off and on for several months, so this identification isn't quite certain.

A young humpback whale
was in the
Strait of Georgia just north of Active Pass
. It was really active, lots of pectoral flailing, tail slapping, half breaches, and tail fluking, it was a very happy humpback! We were able to find a group of about a dozen transient killer whales spread out and hidden in the fog off Beechy Head. Skipper Matt had a great afternoon trip over at Salmon Bank where his passengers were able to see two minke whales. Captain Scott also picked up a humpback whale east of Victor Gulf. Meanwhile, Skipper Bo found a minke whale of his own on his
3:00 zodiac. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
