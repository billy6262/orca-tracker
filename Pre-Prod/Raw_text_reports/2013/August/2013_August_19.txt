Orca Sightings for August 19, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were walking around
Neck Point, Nanaimo, BC when a small pod of orcas
surfaced close to the shore. It looked like two pairs of adult females with small calves and maybe two more juvenile orcas. It was 8 p.m. and they were headed west to Nanoose Bay. - Cathy Ray

Captain Matt picked up a group of
five transients north of Galiano Island
! First Mate Anthony identified as the three
T100s along with T18 and T19
. We heard reports that the
southern residents were out west near Jordan River
. We picked up a group of
three male transients off Zero Rock (east of Victoria in Haro Strait)
. At the end of the day the orcas had made a kill at Constance Bank judging by all the sea birds picking up the scraps. Our
12:15 was on scene with the five
T30s off Discovery Island
! - Naturalist Leah Kuzmuk, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

Great couple of days with the
T18's
! Watched them pick off seal after seal
yesterday near Gooch island
and today they joined up with the
T100's
(minus the T100B's),
T20 and T21 along Galiano shoreline.
The highlight of the day was watching T19B and T100C interacting....lots of play! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
