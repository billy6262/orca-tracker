Orca Sightings for August 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:00 PM - 4 Orcas
seen from
Lime Kiln SP
heading south. - Andrew Shoemaker
*
We reached
L pod orcas as we neared Eagle Point
. The first two orcas we visited were
L88, Wave Walker, and L84, Nyssa
. These two big males were swimming around looking for salmon. After watching them for quite a while we moved northward to check out the
L54 subpod consisting of L54, Ino, L100, Indigo, L108, Coho, and L117
. - Island Adventures Whale Watch
*
We have gotten into a routine in the past couple of days, as we have been fortunate enough to have
6 members of L pod
staying in the same area off Eagle Point,
San Juan Island
. Naturalist Wilma noted that the whales appeared to be actively feeding and surfacing, sometimes rolling over, exposing their entire underside! Our last trip came across
a lone humpback whale
as they were en route back to
Victoria harbour
! The whale was milling in the waters south of Discovery Island in Juan de Fuca Strait. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

and heading southwest through Boundary Pass. Looks like the whales could be
T20 & T21

today. Went to
Active Pass
before turning north in Georgia Strait. - Jennifer Leclerc

Ken Balcomb reports that
T20 and T21 were up near the Belle Isles
today.

Between

7:00 and
8:00 a.m
.,while salmon fishing off "the caves" at
Sekiu, WA
, we observed what appeared to be
at least 2 gray whales
(minimal "bump" for pectoral fin), including an adult and a juvenile, swimming back and forth along a gravel/sand beach located north of the Sekiu airport. The whales were observed in relatively shallow waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We were Chinook fishing in water approximately 100' deep, and they were swimming between us and the beach, closer to the beach than to us. - Tony Melchiors
