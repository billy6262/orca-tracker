Orca Sightings for August 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A lone
minke whale between Ebey's Landing and Pt. Partridge ~9am
heading north ~1 mile out. - Al Luneman
*
9 am - A Minke whale
just surfaced about 100 yards off the point at
Fort Casey
. Reported by Clarence who's with members of the Whidbey Island Fly Fishing Club at Ft Casey. What a treat! - Jill Hein
*
We were out with the
T036s
who were a challenge to keep up with as they were constantly changing directions. Suddenly they surfaced and there were 3 times as many whales as there were before! Somewhere down there, out of nowhere, other Ts joined them. We watched them hunting and although we didn't see a kill, their behavior made us believe there was a kill. Lots of splashing, fast action, etc. This was followed by some excellent spy hops. - Jeff Friedman

7:50 am - 4-6 orcas off Monarch Head,
Saturna heading toward Taylor Point. - Morgan Robinson
*
Very interesting watching the
T30s
this morning. They did a 180 for about five minutes, and then another 180, and moments later, the explosion! They went after we think a harbor seal. See just a few of the pictures below...

11:45 in Swanson Channel
, BC. We spent the rest of the day with transient orcas. Lots of
SRKWs headed in toward the West Side this evening
... - James Maya
*
We started the day with a group of
5 transients in Boundary Pass
who were identified as the
T30 matriline
. Skippers Bo and Marek both saw the transients kill a harbour seal just meters from the boat! The whale breached while tossing the seal up in the air, only to catch it again before dragging it under water. Naturalist Jen aboard the Ocean Magic, said that they started listening to the whales vocalizing underwater using the hydrophones, but then those weren't needed anymore as the whales began vocalizing above the water! Our afternoon trips came across
8-12 transients
slowly heading east parallel to the Victoria waterfront just off Trial Island. We also were on scene with
a lone humpback south of Race Rocks
, near the VG buoy. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Tasha Townzen called to report seeing
2 killer whales between the jetties at the mouth of the Rogue River
at Gold Beach OR at
6 pm
on 8/24. Neither was an adult male.
*

1:18 - Minke headed south off of point Wilson
. - Chrissy McLean
