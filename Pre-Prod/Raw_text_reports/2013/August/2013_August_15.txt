Orca Sightings for August 15, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
There was a thick fog bank in the Juan de Fuca Strait, but Mark found
two humpback whales
near Sheringham Point! He continued on west to where the
Jordan River meets the Strait, where he found a superpod of orcas! J, K, and L pods were all in this area
feeding on the large number of salmon near the entrance to the river.
In the afternoon there were 6 members of L pod near Secretary Island
, just south of East Sooke Park. Naturalist Claire identified this matriline called the
L54's
, led by the female L54 (Ino). She travels with her offspring
Indigo L100, Coho L108, and Keta L117
; there were also two unrelated males with her today, known as
Nyssa L84 and Wave Walker L88
. There were also
5 humpback whales south of Race Rocks
, who appeared to be resting in the calm water under the fog. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

During the superpod today I saw. . .
J26
attempting to mate with
L72, L95
doing the same with
J28, L87
off on a date with
L94, and J27
playing swords with
L95
. Just a few days ago I also saw
J26
trying to mate with
85 year old L25
! Romance is in the air! They were all headed for the West side of San Juan Island from Hein Bank. - Melisa Pinnow

Skipper Mark was on scene with
J and K pod
, two of our resident killer whale groups, heading east
along the Victoria waterfront towards Trial Island
. After hearing reports of transients offshore in the Juan de Fuca Strait, he guided the boat south. They came across a group of
10 transient killer whales
. Mark has spent years researching and identifying transient killer whales in Southern British Columbia, so our guests were treated to insightful facts and experiences with these fascinating mammals! But the tour didn't stop here - Mark still had time to head towards
Race Rocks, where he found a lone humpback whale
. On his afternoon trip, he came across
two different humpback whales south of Race
, one of which we identified as "Big Mama." The afternoon was spent with the resident
L pod
killer whales. Naturalist Claire believed that
all 41 members of the pod
were present, who were actively playing and curiously approaching the the boat! In the
afternoon
, they continued on
towards Victoria Harbour, where they intercepted all of the J and K killer whale pods
! - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

It's cold, it's wet and it's hard to navigate through but there is nothing quite like seeing those dorsal fins break the surface surrounded by fog. Unbelievable day of the
west side of San Juan
. We cruised down there and slowly crept our way through the fog knowing that the whales were somewhere in the area and then all of a sudden
the K14's
surprised us appearing out of the fog. We spent most of our time with
K14 and her crew K36, K42 and K26. We also ID'd L84, J8 and L87

We spent most of the day with this lovely group of
Transient Orcas (T 101's, 102, 90's, 100b's)
. We met them just behind
Quadra Island in Sutil Channel
ending at the top of Hoskyn Channel. We got to observe a lot of different behavior (traveling & sleeping mostly, a quick celebration), but the most interesting one was them trying to go through a small passage fighting against a current. Once they were in the current, they went crazy! Lots of breaches, tail lobbing, rolling, upside down swimming! They tried three times, but the younger ones just couldn't handle it. The third time, I saw one of the "middle" ones (size) try to porpoise through, but the current was so strong when she/he landed that it swept him/her back down a few feet, then he/she swam back down taking the rest of the group, but the two large males with him/her. Then the two males returned with the group and they all went back down the channel to go around Quadra the long way. In-between trials, they played in small currents below the passage. We also saw a couple of them rubbing their bodies along the rocks. We assume they were using the lower part of the current for massages. Just a whole other side to Transients. It was a great way to end the long day. - Michele Wassell

T100 and T124
.... they headed straight for two paddle boarders, causing them to paddle like they've never paddled before for the safety of land. T100 and T124 ever so casually cruised right along the rocks where the two girls were collapsed on the rocks, their legs having clearly given out from fear... it was awesome. - Tasli Shaw
