Entry 1:
Saw a
superpod this afternoon of the J and K pod orcas
while westbound on the Spirit of British Columbia ferry on the
11 am
sailing. Made the ferry stop all engines while the pods passed. Plenty of spy hopping and breaching to be witnessed. One adult rolled right next to the ferry. Was quite magnificent! - Todd Guiton

Early this morning we heard reports of
resident orcas heading for Active Pass
, so our 9am Zodiac and Ocean Magic tours from Victoria went directly to the whales to confirm their location. They caught up with
over 60 whales from all three pods: J, K, and L
. All of our drivers reported that the whales were extremely active while exhibiting spy hops, breaches, and tail slapping. Naturalist Lindsay spotted two familiar whales among the group, one was a large male,
J27 "Blackberry"
, and the other male
J34 who is known as "DoubleStuf."
Near Pender Island they spotted a group of
12 transient orcas in Boundary Pass
traveling south; the whales were believed to be the
T36 and T37
groups. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray

We were so lucky to be able to see the
orcas up-close from a friend's place on Galiano Island
. Cannot really express the feeling of seeing them live. - Janusz Kowalski

5:49 - Residents in Boundary Pass
headed south. - James Mead Maya

We saw them swim up the
W side of SJI this morning
, passing Snug Harbor in spread out groups around

6:30AM
. We met up with them coming out of
Active Pass around 11AM
. They seemed excited and very active. Lots and lots of tail slaps and breaches. Once out into the Strait of Georgia they spread out into small groups. - Jeff Friedman
