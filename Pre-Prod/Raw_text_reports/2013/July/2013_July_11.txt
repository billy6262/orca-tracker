Orca Sightings for July 11, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
"Gay Abandon" - that's what I'll call this southern resident frolicking along the
west side of San Juan Island
along with other members of
J, K and L pods
. After braving some choppy waters, passengers on "Mystic Sea" enjoyed the phenomenal sight of numerous members of the "superpod" cruising along in singles, doubles and groups, foraging and socializing in one of their favorite places on yet another glorious, sunlit day. - Sandra Pollard
