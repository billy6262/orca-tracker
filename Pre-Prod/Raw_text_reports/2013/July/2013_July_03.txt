This
afternoon
we circumnavigated San Juan Island, stopping for an intimate encounter with the
L22s
again. I love this route! The scenery alone is worth the trip! - Ivan Reiff

We had the most amazing
minke whale
encounter I have EVER had in 17 years of being out on the water. Huge bait balls of fish surrounding the Western Prince, and out of nowhere, a minke grabbed a bait ball less than 20 feet in front of the boat. Fish flying everywhere, we watched him swallow up the fish, roll over sideways and push the air out of his mouth. So amazing that the passengers wanted to stay with the minkes instead of going to see the orcas. Jonathan Stern, you would have been so proud! - John Boyd
