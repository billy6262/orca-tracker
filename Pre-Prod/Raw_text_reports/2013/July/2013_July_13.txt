Orca Sightings for July 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:35 -
A group of folks were treated to a great show today for over an hour and a half (

11:00 -
12:30
) between
Skiff Point and Rolling Bay near Bainbridge Island
. From shore, we were able to watch a large group of Ts today milling, breaching and even cartwheeling at times. About 15 min. or so before they started booking north, we saw what we think was a porpoise airborne in the middle of the activity. - Susan Marie Andersson

On Saturday around
noon
the Coast Guard was asked by a boater to protect a "
pod of Orcas
" that was being harrassed by an inflatable just south of Pt Jefferson (Kitsap peninsula, across from Shoreline). The CG responded with one of their fast 25s. - Larry Brown
*
I had a great sail with the
Orcas from Bainbridge up to my destination of Kingston
. - Gary Peterson.

Mini breach off
Skiff Pt. Bainbridge Island

On Saturday we were taking the

6:25
ferry sailing from
Kingston to Edmonds
and saw a group of about
8 orcas
just south of the ferry route,
closer to the Edmonds side
. We could see both males and females. - Sean & Shari Tallarico

The
L22's, Spirit (L22) and her sons Skana (L79) and Solstice (L89)
maintained a serene pace as they took part in the 'west side shuffle' off
San Juan Island
today. Skana stayed close to his mother while Solstice foraged a little further inshore. As "Mystic Sea" left the tranquil scene Solstice joined his mother and brother, and all three whales traveled northbound in harmony. Lots of boats present, also Soundwatch busy educating boaters and WDFW keeping a watchful eye. Three Minke whales made fleeting appearances off Salmon Bank as we headed homeward, so we had a mixture of baleen and toothed whales today. Then there were the Pacific Harbor seals, harbor porpoise and eagles - just another perfect day in the Pacific Northwest. - Sandra Pollard. Freeland, Whidbey Island
