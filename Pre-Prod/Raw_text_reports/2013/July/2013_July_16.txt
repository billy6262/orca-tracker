Entry 1:
John Dean called with an unusual report from Tuesday evening, of hearing many blows over about 45 minutes to an hour, after sunset, starting around

9:15 pm
, from very shallow water (6 to 10 feet deep) off
Kopachuck Park in Carr Inlet
, near Gig Harbor. He said he also heard other blows from farther out, and he heard several high-pitched whistles, much like orca calls. Eventually all the blows and calls drifted away in the darkness.
