Orca Sightings for July 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
After spending most of the morning doing a
'west side shuffle'
,
Js Ks and Ls
began to split up and make their way north. Most of them headed east in
Boundary Pass
after passing Turn Point, but the
K13s went west up into Swanson Channel
. We met up with the K13s at around

15:30
as they were tight to the shoreline along the Pender Island Bluffs, fairly spread out. When they passed Thieves Bay, K20 and K13 began tail slapping numerous times, then the 7 whales all came together to rest, diving methodically and rising in unison. We followed them to the mouth of Active Pass, where they started to "wake up" and change behaviour, becoming more spread out and even spyhopping a few times. - Tasli Shaw

The fun continued today. Wonderful groups with a mix of
J's and K's heading north from Kellet Bluff
. Yesterday, we had crazy activity and today was a lot more mellow. They were in a resting pattern for most of our trip, it was beautiful. Anyways, here are a few shots from today. We had
J8, J17, L87, K20, K38 , K33, K12, K37, K43, K26, K25
and others in this awesome whale soup ;). - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

5:30 pm -
Encountered what appeared to be
three transients
on our way back to Victoria this afternoon right off
Clover Point
! One juvenile, two females, though one could be a sprouting male. Photos and ID's to come soon! After pouring through ID images... these may be residents. Very hard to tell at this point due to the wave action we experienced. If they were rezzies, any number of them could have been sneaking out in those waves without us knowing it, leaving behind the group that was at Pender. - Marcie Callewaert
