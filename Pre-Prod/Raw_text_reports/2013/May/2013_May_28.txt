Orca Sightings for May 28, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the way back to our dock at Snug Harbor we heard a report of inbound whales. To old salty sea captains, like me, that means whales coming in from the ocean west of Victoria, but probably more Ts. Then the sweet words came over our radio!
Js!
We've seen them only four times since March so the news was especially sweet. The
Js were happy and all accounted for
, including Granny, their 100ish year old matriarch.

10-20 orcas about 500m off shore
. At

they had all gone through
Race passage.
