Orca Sightings for May 29, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here are some images from our AMAZING encounter with the
002C's and 123's
. We had a report of 5 KW's off of
Marina Island
(near Campbell River, north end of Georgia Strait) from a watertaxi. So all the vessels converged on the area. 2 had gone through, no luck, so we slowed down and had a good look. When my guest who was facing backwards spotted them she practically jumped out of her seat! They were being very social, some tail lobs, small spy hops etc. the Juveniles were doing small breaches. Then all of a sudden T002C came flying out of the water so high I couldn't believe it!! Still amazed I was able to capture it! She then jumped 4 more x back to back! 123A got in on the action and breached a few times as well! Every time we went to leave it started again!
