Orca Sightings for May 23, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

4:06pm
a very large mature
Humpback Whale
surfaced directly in front of our place in
Davis Bay (Sechelt), BC
. It was a single animal and was traveling south along the shoreline in shallower water. It surfaced approximately 10 times in the time I observed it, making dives and showing it's tail. It is not common to see whales on this area of the coast so it is considered a significant sighting locally. The first time I saw it, it surfaced about 100 feet from shore and I was looking directly down on top of it from my vantage point then chased it along the beach trying to get photos. Was a thrilling thing to see!
