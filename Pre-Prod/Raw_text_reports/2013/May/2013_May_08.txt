Kelly Stadler of Coupeville called to report
one or two Gray whales feeding off of Madrona Way (Penn Cove) at
7:30 am
- they fed back and forth for awhile very close to the shore (20' out), then headed toward the Mussel dock off the Hwy, then back toward Coupeville. They also saw Gray whales in Penn Cove two weeks ago.

Awesome day in the southern Strait of Georgia! We encountered a significant group (
at least 11, likely more) of Bigg's (transient) orcas
, spread out approximately one mile off the eastern shore of
Tumbo Island (east side of Saturna Island).
There were at least two main groups of animals (1/4 mile apart) heading south east, with what appeared to be the signature ragged edge dorsal of
T63
about several hundred yards out from the nearest group (other boats on scene confirmed the presence of T63). Our boat was fortunate enough to spend time with the
T2Cs, T123s, and T102
who were traveling in a closeknit group, surfacing in unison at a leisurely pace. T102 broke off from the group to travel on his own, while
T123A and T2C1
(aka "Rocky") were seen engaged in some "touchy feely" tactile behavior (I saw T2C1 upside-down at one point with T123A rolling on his side in unison). T123A has some discoloration on the right side of his dorsal (like a grey sunburn) ... something to take note of next time he is seen. Very beautiful and so exciting to see multiple Bigg's killer whales in one area! I feel very lucky to have seen them.

Best EVER encounter with
Transients
tonight 10 minutes from the dock...Unbelievable Transient Orca Show in
Samsum Narrows
. I have never seen Transients so social and airbourne. At one point there were four orcas completely out of the water at the same time. Lots and lots of surface vocalizations and even vocalizations while they were breaching. The Orcas blows and surface vocalizations were echoing off the rock bluffs at Bold Bluff in Sansum Narrows. They were still going off non-stop when I left at dark. It was the
T049B's and the T065A's
, totaling seven animals.

We had an amazing encounter with about
15-20 Transients Orcas. We had T63, the T123s and the T2Cs
for sure. Many others as well. We were with them
2 miles north of Patos Island at
3:00 PM
. Ken Balcomb was heading out there as we were coming in. So he should have a full list of IDs.
