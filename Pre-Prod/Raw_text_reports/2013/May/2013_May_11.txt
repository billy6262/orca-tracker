I found
T068, T068A, and the T111's
west bound east of
Pillar Point
(approx. 30 west of Port Angeles, Strait of Juan de Fuca) in the morning.

T49Bs and T65As
encountered going through
Porlier Pass
into Trincomali Channel (Gulf Islands). We observed two kills, the first was definitely a harbor seal (as confirmed by photos from another boat) and the second kill appeared to be a seal as well. It was interesting to watch T65A and T65A4, who were several hundred yards north, come porpoising at high speed to the rest of the group, where they were subduing a harbour seal. T65A and T65A4 then joined in the feast. It was like they were being called for dinner!

Well all I can say about today is WOW! We found the
T49B's and T65A's
heading down
Trincomali Channel
(Gulf Islands, approx. 25 miles south of Nanaimo). Along the way they got hungry, we shut our boat down and they put on one hell of a show. 25 minutes of playing with the seal before finishing the job...it was one if the coolest things I have ever seen.

9:10am - Humpback whale
just off end of
Fauntleroy ferry dock
, flippering (pectoral slapping) the water. Possibly moving slowly north. I was too far away to get a photo before the whale submerged, but the shape and size of the flipper (12'-16') and the slapping of the water were unmistakable Humpback traits. People on the ferry said that the whale had been very close to the boat (while docked at the pier). I watched the water for an additional 5 minutes until the ferry left, but sadly didn't see the animal again. Absolutely phenomenal experience - I never expected to see a Humpback in Puget Sound.
