Orca Sightings for May 12, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mother's Day - what a treat seeing
transient orcas T49B's and T69A's off Iceberg Point, Lopez Island, around
1:30 pm
on a glassy calm day. The two groups... were extremely active with spy-hops, breaches, cartwheels, and some surface vocalization to celebrate a recent kill.

12:30 p.m. -
MV Mystic Sea reporting
7 Transient Orcas off the South end of the San Juan Channel
! We have identified that three of the whales are T49Bs [revised] and 4 whales are T69As. It is a phenomenal show with the Transients breaching, rolling and jumping. There are two immatures and the elder whales seem to be teaching the young ones to make a kill. We have calm seas, mixed fog and blue sky and incredible conditions. What a BEAUTIFUL show!!!

my little sister, Siri Love, spotted either a gray whale or
a humpback
(she isn't sure) in the water just off of
Fort Ward park Bainbridge island

We're guessing this is a humpback

Got a text around noon from Bob Fields and Holly and I flew out the door and caught up with
three orcas
near the
Empire boat ramp, inside Coos Bay OR
, at about
1PM
, we saw them off and on for an hour and finally lost them near Charleston, a male, mother, and calf it appeared to me. Very cool- a lifer for Holly, I have only seen them in the bay one other time but they occasionally come up, but I usually hear about it after the fact.
