Orca Sightings for May 3, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
My wife announced about

10:30
that she saw a couple big dorsal fins [about
a mile south of Little Skookum in Totten Inlet,
where the
two Risso's dolphins
were seen
May 6]. Of course I had to look so I grabbed the camera and headed for the lawn to take a few shots. I called John Calambokidis at Cascadia Research and he said a pair of Risso's dolphins have been in south sound for a year or so. Then he reminded me I called about this time last year ! So quickly I forget!

We Spotted
a humpback whale
this afternoon about
3 pm off Mukilteo Beach
, heading south. Never saw the head or flippers but it had the humpback-shaped dorsal fin and tail. It surfaced 4 or 5 times. About 20 minutes later, saw it moving back north (assumed it was the same whale).
