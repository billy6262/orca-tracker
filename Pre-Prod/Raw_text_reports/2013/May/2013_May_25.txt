Orca Sightings for May 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a
humpback
do several full breaches near the
southern end of Lopez Island
! It was absolutely breathtaking to see a creature of that size lunge out of the water, over and over! And the noises he was making were so loud - it was almost like he was grunting or growling at the same time as he would come up and do his blows on the surface.

The amazing, incredible, breaching
Humpback in San Juan Channel
!!! Roughly 33 breaches in about 3 miles! Multiple ferries even got to see it too! The Western Explorer is in the image, and the UW Friday Harbor Labs is in the background.

Very rare to see the
T77s
. We got there in time to see them taking a seal, out near
Albert Head, BC
, south of Victoria. We left them after the kill headed toward Race Rocks, at

3:00 in the afternoon
.
