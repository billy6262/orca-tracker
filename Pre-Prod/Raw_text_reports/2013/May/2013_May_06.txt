Orca Sightings for May 6, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'd like to report the sighting of
2 Orcas, one male and one female
, traveling north from
Narvaez Bay, Saturna Island
around East Pt. and continuing north in the Georgia Straight. Sighting them from kayaks we watched them for about an hour and one half from

9:30am until
11:00am
.
They were traveling at a leisurely pace taking long dives and then a few breaths on the surface. Once they entered the Georgia Str. they both engaged in tail slapping on each surfacing. It was a beautiful day with flat seas and clear conditions. The whale blows could be heard from a considerable distance away.

We searched the flat calm waters for almost 5 hours before finally seeing
T20 and T21
break the surface in the
Strait of Georgia
. The views of the coastal mountains were unbelievable and water conditions couldn't have been better. Another great day out there!

Grey whale
sighted off of the point by
Ft Casey
about 1000 yards off the coast
1230
. Sea gulls were flocking towards it as it came to the surface. Is it normal for the sea gulls the dive and peck at it?

Just sighted a
humpback
heading north in
Colvos Passage
in the Olalla area (about

10:45 am
). I was working in the yard and quickly turned around when I heard the blow - just in time to see his/her back and a nice fluke. He/she dove for quite a while then did a quick surface before heading out of view. Perfect day!

On a truly glorious spring (more like summer) day, one young
Minke whale
kept passengers on "Mystic Sea" guessing where he (or she) would surface next in the glassy sea off the
west side of San Juan Island
. A school of harbor porpoise in Cattle Pass, sunbathing Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks and a watchful nesting eagle in Hughes Bay made for a perfect trip.

I'd like to report the sighting of
2 to 3 Pilot whales North of Tumbo island
. They were maybe a quarter of a mile away but appeared to be feeding and moving north up the Strait of Georgia at

10:30am to
11:00am
.
