Orca Sightings for May 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
, breaching and showing off it's huge pectorals. And,
a grey whale close to Tumbo Island
- not very common here either. The
transient orcas have been seen almost everyday
. It's been a great week of fantastic sightings!

At about
7 pm
, Bonnie Gretz of Coupeville called to relay a report from Dan Miranda, of
a Gray whale splashing around in Penn Cove
, Coupeville, near the boat launch.
*
Clarence Hein called to relay a report he'd received from a friend who was at the Front Street Grille
in Coupeville, watching a Gray whale spy-hopping
in front of the restaurant - wow - Coupeville is getting a show tonight!!
*
We received a call from a woman in
Greenbank
, who was watching
a Gray whale feed off "downtown" Greenbank
(the beach directly across from Bakken Rd) at

12:50 pm
.

Entry 2:
A humpback whale in Boundary Pass
, breaching and showing off it's huge pectorals.

T063 "Chainsaw"
off of
Mittlenatch Island, upper Gulf of Georgia
. Looking at others' photos from the day, it looks like we had
25+ Transient KW's
in the area!
063 was with 065B's and 023's
. also saw pics of
T100's and 101/102's. and T069D
. We left them spread in a line 3 miles wide headed south between Salmon Point and Mittlenatch last night at
2000hrs
.

The Mystic Sea found
two Transient Orcas
about 3 miles
south of Trial Island
, south of Victoria. We identified them as brothers;
T93, born in 1963, and T97, born in 1980
. The two Transients were travelling fairly fast, making about 7 knots. They were veering apart and then coming back together . . . then Captain Monte Hughes shut the engines off for a while and it was such a treat to watch their huge dorsal fins rise up out of the water together, when the only sounds to be heard were of the water lapping up against the hull of the boat, and the mystical sound of the Orcas' blows! When it was time for the Mystic Sea to start heading home the whales were off of Constance Bank heading east towards Whidbey Island. On the way back towards Lopez Island we had a great sighting of a large group of Harbor Porpoise (almost like mini-Orcas!) playing on the surface near the weather buoy.

T93 and T97
, west of
Hein Bank at
3:30 PM
, headed south toward Pt. Townsend. There were four groups of Ts today. I love our whales and our mountains.

I came across
T093 and T097
in the morning 9 miles south of
Victoria
, zig zagging around after harbor porpoise but generally traveling east.
I also spotted
T040 "Captain Hook"
2 miles south of
Race Rocks
also traveling east 6 miles behind them.

At
11am
this morning,
two Orcas
, one following the other a good distance apart and not far from shore, headed east past
Eagle Cove
. From
11:05 am to
11:35, one lone orca was hanging out fairly close to shore, first at Eagle Cove and then at Eagle Point, feeding, before heading west. Nothing dramatic, only one minor tail lob. It's so wonderful to have them back! Again, all of these were late this morning at Eagle Cove/Eagle Point.
