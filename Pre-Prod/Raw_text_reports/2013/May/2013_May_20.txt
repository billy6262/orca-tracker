Dave Ellifrit at the Center for Whale Research has confirmed them as K pod.

Some of the
20-25 offshore killer whales in Kachemak Bay, Alaska
. They killed a few sharks; floating liver samples were collected for species ID. They rested after foraging for two hours. Can you spot the baby?

Large
gray whale surfacing in Plumper Sound
, north shore of South Pender heading east about 25 minutes ago.
Our neighbor thinks it's a Humpback
. They spotted one earlier this morning heading into Plumper Sound. HUGE event for us!

Had the
T123's and 002C's this afternoon
. They appeared northbound up the
East shore of Texada Island
. We picked them up just after a kill of some kind had occurred. There were multiple breaches and other activity shortly before us arriving on scene. We arrived on scene @
1445
and left @
1630
. When we left they were traveling north @ 4-5 knots, aiming for Grants Reef just south of Savary island.
123A
was travelling with
002C2
, bringing up the rear. Does anyone else notice that 002C2 is always behind a little when the gang is swimming? It's something I always wonder. Seems to be happening more lately when I have seen them. The order switched, and when I left 2C was with her calf, 2C1 was speed swimming with 123A, and 123 and C2 were bringing up the rear!

This afternoon around
12pm
Jon Scordino received a call from the fish dock reporting
killer whales inside the Neah Bay harbor
. Unfortunately our boat was not available, but I went and sighted them from land. When I first caught up to them (

12:15
) they were way inside the harbor, closer to the jetty side, straight out from the fuel dock. I watched them until about

12:45
when they were passing the coast guard dock on the way out of the harbor. They were probably inside the harbor for over an hour based on when and where they were first reported. My best guess was
4-5 whales
. I think at least 3 adult sized and one smaller one. There was one large male with a somewhat wavy looking dorsal fin. They were just traveling very slow and occasionally milling around.

The Center for Whale Research responds to the photos: The photos are tentatively identified by Dave Ellifrit as T73B, T73C, and T73C1, with the highest confidence being T73B. They are on the DFO Transient guide page 72/73. They are not common in this area. They are in the report of 6
May 2013 off Trinidad, CA. T73B was a juvenile in our first Hood Canal encounter years ago (2003).

We decided to go for the more northerly orcas at
Crofton
- turns out it was the always-exciting
T49B's and T65A's
. By the time we got there, they had already caught something - still not entirely certain what, but the prey was divided up early and it seems everyone had a piece to swim around with or toss around. T65A2 swam past us underwater with a piece of the leftovers gripped in its mouth. They were batting pieces of hide and blubber around with their tails quite a lot. In one shot, an orca has this piece wrapped around her peduncle, and the colouring of it matches quite closely - perhaps it was a Dall's porpoise. The whales were spread out in a couple little subgroups that kept diverging and regrouping. Lots of action, lots of gulls picking up scraps.

I live on Hammerslet Inlet in
Shelton, Wa
. I spotted
2 small Orca this morning at
6:45am
. They were headed out toward main channel and away from Shelton. I hope I can hear back from someone when they're spotted headed my way as I always get great pictures.
