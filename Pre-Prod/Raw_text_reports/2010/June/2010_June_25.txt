Orca Sightings for June 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, Emma Foster and Astrid van Ginneken of CWR encountered members of
J-pod
just a little South of Snug Harbor at

9:44 a.m.
(48째 50945 N;123째 14.934 W), and stayed with them down to eagle cove. They were spread out and slowly traveling north. We ended our encounter with a spectacular breach from J19, right back outside Snug Harbor, at
12:07 p.m. (48째 51.323 N; 123째 15.034 W).

I have also enclosed a picture of
J28 & J46
near
False Bay
, at
3.10pm
. The Orcas were heading south when we left them, we had about 10 Orcas including
J28 & J46, J14 & J45, K21 & K40
. We picked them up again in the evening just below
Lime Kiln
and followed them as they moved steadily south during the evening. Most of J-pod had earlier moved north.

A
Gray Whale
has been hanging around
Victoria
for the past few days. One of our Naturalists, Kristen Kanes, who was involved in Gray Whale Research & I.D. last summer with UVIC has recognized this Gray Whale as one they nicknamed "2 dot Star". We first saw this particular Whale about a month ago near
Hein Bank
and the Whale has been seen around Victoria for almost a week now. We encountered him on
June 25th just south of Great Chain at about
4.30pm
.

Debbie Lewis called Orca Network to report a sighting of
3 orcas
at about

10:30 AM
, including "one adult and 2 juveniles," 14-15 miles out from the
Crescent City CA
lighthouse, in 100 fathoms depth.

Who was Mr.
Ruffles
traveling with this afternoon? Around
5 pm
, about
8 orcas
were heading east through
Active Pass
on a bit of a tide. First a group of about 5, then a group of 3. Some tail slapping, body cartwheels, and a breach or two.

Softly we sat and watched the whales (
So. Residents
) about 700 yards away from us. At first we could only see white wake, their bodies like boats zooming through the water. As we waited, their dorsal fins began to loom in the distance. We followed them as they swam parallel to us west along the south side of
Stuart Island
, reuniting with their pod at Turn Point Light House. It was a slow but satiating afternoon as we watched the orcas loll about the land, hugging the shore. Bright, sunny, peaceful and with a bit of wind, when it was time to go, it felt like a dream one wasn't quite ready to let go of.

: Awesome
calls
, squeals and clicks on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
! It sounds like they are breaching and smacking their flukes agains the water's surface as well!

There were
Orcas
spread out at
7 AM
this morning headed north towards
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. Such a nice way to start the day!

This morning started off wonderfully at about

6:00am
with flat seas and soft lighting on the west side. When I went outside I found members of
J Pod
resting on the water off of
Hannah Heights
. They were not really going anywhere- rarely diving and not a lot of activity. It was as if they too were enjoying the new found warmth in the air. They continued in this manner for the next 3 hours with very few vocalizations on the hydrophones, milling slowly towards Land Bank eventually grouping up rather nicely offshore. Languid seems to be the word of the morning!

We found a group of
five killer whales
today at 36'45.2 and 121'58.3. We were near sea lions as well as pacific white-sided dolphins and it was pretty obvious one of the two became their lunch. We could see slick on the water (probably the oil from whatever they killed) and gulls and albatross started picking bits off the surface where the whales were. Very exciting!

Here are IDs for most of the transient killer whales that Kate Cummings saw today in Monterey Bay:
CA122 (T164), CA122a, CA122b
, and a sprouting male (juv of
CA171
). This male was sighted off of Los Angeles Harbor on
May 20, and off of Oxnard, CA on
May 30. We may have had him again off Los Angeles Harbor on
June 22; I will be receiving photos soon that will allow me to confirm this. We have had a cluster of transient killer whale sightings off of my area since
May 10 - very unusual for us.
