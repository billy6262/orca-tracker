Today was filled with sightings of marine birds, several bald eagles, harbor seals, and killer whales. By the time we rounded the north end of
San Juan Island
, our guests had learned about the connections between the nutrient rich waters, fish, marine mammals, and humans. There we saw
J-1 & J-2
, slowly leading several groups of J's along with
some L's and K's
, north along the west side of San Juan Island. At Mosquito Pass many of the younger whales breached several times! The orcas showed us a bit of their culture and lifelong family ties.
