Orca Sightings for June 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:15 a.m
and again at
8 am
brief
calls
over
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. Scanning from the park within 15 minutes of hearing those calls revealed nothing. At

1:00pm J and K pods
passed
Lime Kiln
going up island, but the J22s, J17s and J11s were not present. They were not present through the entire day when the whales were last seen exiting Active Pass at
6:30 pm.

Just before
6 PM
they started coming. Rather than grab the binoculars as I usually do, I went out on the front lawn and just watched with my naked eyeballs as a rather large group of
orcas
came through
Active Pass
, hugging the shoreline at Helen Point as they entered Georgeson Bay. There was a bit of tail lobbing, an occasional breach, and what looked like quite a bit of fun as they came through. Then a second wave of orcas (looked like J pod to me) showed up, and when the got into the middle of the Pass, they all congregated quite closely to each other and rested near the surface for a few minutes. And then they went under, not to be seen again on this splendid evening.

After watching
J's, K's and L87
pass by the Center for Whale Research, Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster, and Erin Heydenreich departed Snug Harbor and encountered them off
Stuart Island
at

2:45 p.m.
(48째 66.694 N, 123째 23.139 W). They were spread out in loose groups traveling north. We observed lots of surface activity and social behavior. The encounter ended at the south end of Swanson Channel at
3:51 p.m. ( 48째 73.043 N, 123째 25.716 W), the whales still spread out heading north.

Captain Craig, the guests, and I cruised north, meeting members of
J Pod
off of
Kellet Bluff on Henry Island
. Henry Island is just northwest of San Juan Island. We started the whale watching portion of the trip watching the Southern Resident Community's most famous member Ruffles, or J1. He traveled along in the lead, not an uncommon behavior for this old guy. After he had passed us by he sharked around up ahead of us at our one o'clock, appearing for roll onto his right side and slowly swim along the surface. After this great viewing, we watched a few whales traveling past us, heading toward Turn Point. Eventually, a large group of tail-slapping, pec-slapping, cartwheeling orcas came past our port side. They were socializing in a way I personally haven't seen yet all season. After they passed by us, we watched them continue their antics all the way up to Stuart Island. In this large group was one adult male, many females (or younger males), a few young animals, and a very young calf. I also saw J26, Mike, having some alone time with a female I was unable to identify. The only orcas I identified today were members of J Pod, but I heard talk of K Pod over the radio and there were many animals I saw that I didn't ID.

On our

1:30
trip,
Js and Ks
right in front of our dock (Smuggler's Cove, NW San Juan Island). On our

4:30
trip we went up into Canada and followed
Js and Ks
through
Active Pass
with only two other boats. Fantastic clouds behind Georgina Point Lighthouse at the north entrance to Active Pass. And not a bad shot of the Turn Point Light either. We were hoping for a Superpod today, but no L Pod. Great to see the Ks.

calls
off
Lime Kiln

1:30 pm
, and then on the
OrcaSound hydrophones
at about

2:30 pm
as J pod traveled north up the west side of San Juan Island.
