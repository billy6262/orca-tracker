Orca Sightings for June 24, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Emma Foster, Erin Heydenreich and Astrid van Ginneken of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J's
heading west through
Spieden Channel
at

1:23 p.m
. (48째 36.327 N; 123째 12.058 W). They were spread out in tight groups traveling fast and porpoising. We followed them until Kellett Bluff where the combination of wind chop and fast whales made it too difficult to collect photo ID's. The encounter ended off Mitchell Bay at
2:27 p.m. (48째 34.752 N; 123째 11.838 W) with the whales continuing to travel quickly south.
