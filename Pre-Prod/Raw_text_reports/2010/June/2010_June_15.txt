============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb encountered
J's
on the west side of
San Juan Island
at

9:15 a.m.
The whales were spread out traveling south. The encounter ended off Lime Kiln at
10:37 a.m.with the J's continuing down the west side.
Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island

I believe these are two of the three youngest members of
J-17's
family. If my IDs are correct, the three wee ones (J-44, J-46, and J-47) were playing together as a group while the mothers (J-17, J-35, and J-28) were nearby. The photo was taken Tuesday evening from shore on the
west side of San Juan Island
.

Jeff Hogan called to report the following sightings of
So. Resident
orcas. At

7:40 am
, the
J22s, J28 and her calf, K21 and K40, and the J11s
were grouped up northbound off the Center for Whale Research,
West San Juan Island
. At 10 am, some turned south, and between 11 and noon, the rest of J pod showed up off the Center for Whale Research from the north. Between 11 am and 1 pm, all the whales came down island past Eagle Pt. At 2 pm, they all headed north, spread out between Hannah Heights and the Center for Whale Research. They headed back south around 6 pm, then turned north again. While he was talking to me, he saw an orca breach off Hannah Heights at
9:20 pm.

Got a couple of pics to share with you (photos included
orca
and a
humpback
whale fluke). The Orca pic was taken on
June 15th right at Point Baker on Prince Of Whales Island, SE Alaska.
Michael Kampnich, Craig, Alaska
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research: He is probably a northern resident although he must have got a new nick since the NR catalogue came out unless I'm completely spacing him out. I don't think AF and AG pods go down that far (although there is no reason why they can't).
