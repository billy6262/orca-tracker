Orca Network received a call at

3:40 pm
from Mike Blair of the Kalaloch Lodge on the
WA Coast
- they have
4 female orcas
& a calf in front of the lodge, milling for 15 minutes in the waves off the entrance to the creek. They saw them coming down from the north, presumably trending south.

It isn't often that we see a
Gray Whale
on our side of the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
. This young animal has been hanging around
Oak Bay, Victoria
waterfront, Mary Todd Island and Willows Beach for a few days. Affectionately named 'Phantom ', since he doesn't show himself too often, but he is there. I saw him on Saturday
June 26th at 1pm. He seemed to be foraging close to a channel marker in the Oak Bay vicinity.

Lately the
Orcas
have been cruising the west side of San Juan Island so when the reports came in today of whales over by
Lummi island
I was really excited. Whales and somewhere new to see! Lummi Island is located just off of Bellingham. We barely made it out of Friday Harbor before we encounter Dall's porpoise frolicking in the wake of boats passing by. The adorable black and white porpoise are often found riding the bow of boats. After a few glimpses of the tiny cetaceans we continued on in search of our larger black and white friends the Orca. We all marveled at the gorgeous day and the wonderful view of Mt. Baker in the distance. Reaching Lummi Island the guests were delighted at the site of a towering dorsal fin gracefully sliding by. Just as reported earlier we were observing
J pod
. Members of the pod were widely spread and appeared to be casually traveling along. Moving further offshore we encountered the infamous
Ruffles and Granny
. The flat calm waters made it easy to see the saddle patches of the Orcas. The saddle patch is unique for each individual and is used in photo identification.

Orcas
passed
Point Roberts Lighthouse Marine Park
in the
morning
. They were traveling south to Rosario Strait and it looked liked it would be down Rosario around Southern Lopez to Haro Strait. But in the early evening they turned and were pointed north. Now orcas have changed directions in this Strait previously but the time to show up at Point Roberts was somewhat unusual.
