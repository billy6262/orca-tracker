Orca Sightings for June 8, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The whales were traveling back to the north. This is when it got really confusing. I had heard calls over
Lime Kiln hydrophones
starting at

4:20 am
. and they moved over to
Orca Sound hydrophones
. When it got light enough, I saw whales going north. Someone else heard whales over the Lime Kiln hydrophones at about

8:30 a.m
. and soon L pod whales (the same groups as mentioned above) were going up island. My pictures show that the
Lpod
group of five - L12, L85, L22, L79 and L89 were at
Open Bay
at

10:30 a.m
. My pictures also show that at
11:15 at Turn Pt. milling about were the J22s and the J17s. Closer to Spieden Island at
12:00, were L12, L85, L22, L79 and L89 in a spread out group heading back down island; the group of L41,L25,L94,L113,and L77 had turned back at Open Bay at about
10:30 and were heading down Island. I heard one operator say that there were 8 to to 10 whales in that group - so I thought that J27,J31 and J39 were still with them. However, when they passed by at Lime Kiln there were only 5 present - L41,L25,L94,L113,L77. We had been at Turn Pt. watching the J22s and the J17s. They didn't seem to be going anywhere, but trending to the north. At
12:30 as we were coming back down island, whales were spotted out in the middle of the Channel going up island - it was J27, J31 and J39 heading north. in the
evening K pod and L87
came in from the west and stayed south.

We saw a solitary whale in Useless Bay. It was not an Orca, most likely a
Gray Whale
, but it was pretty far away in the middle of Useless Bay (where the upwelling is) and well out of the shipping channel. We watched this animal for about 30 minutes (8 pm). The whole time, it swam in circles on the surface and appeared to be bobbing in the water (taking bites; surface feeding?) at about 1 bob per second. We had good binoculars, but it was pretty far away. It had barnacles on it's nose. We saw a fin from time to time and several blows. It appeared to be quite long and slender. We watched until it was too cold and dark. Is this consistent with Gray Whale feeding behavior?? It definitely was a whale; the first live one we have seen in Useless Bay in 8 years!

The Center for Whale Research received a report of
K pod
coming in from the Strait of Juan de Fuca around
3 p.m
. Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster and Erin Heydenreich encountered
K's and L 87
spread out in groups traveling east at

6:01 pm
(48° 21.56 N, 123° 12.85 W). The L12's came from the south west side of San Juan Island and met up with the K's around Middle Bank. We observed lots of milling, tactile behavior with lots of breaches, taillobs, and logging. All K pod whales were photographed and accounted for, including a new calf. The
new calf, K43
, was seen traveling with
K12
. We were also able to determine that K36 is a female. The encounter ended at
7:37 p.m. north of Middle bank (48° 23.60 N, 123° 04.53 W). The whales continued to travel east in spread out groups. They reportedly turned around later and went back out the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster of the Center for Whale Research encountered the
L12's
in a tight group just outside
Mitchell Bay
(48° 35.16 N, 123° 12.09 W) at

9:50 a.m
. They were traveling slow and close to the shore of Henry Island. We left the group at
10:18 a.m. and went north to Turn Point. We encountered J17, J35, J44, and J47 traveling north. We observed a lot of surface activity, mostly from the calves and especially from J pod's youngest member, J47. We later spotted the J22's also traveling north toward Swanson Channel. The encounter ended several miles
north of Turn Point
(48° 42.89 N, 123° 14.90 W) at
11:35 a.m.

K pod
returned, bringing with them a new calf.
K43
was seen traveling with
K12
, who is presumed to be the mother. K12 is estimated to be 38 years old. She has two existing offspring, K22 and K37, and one grandchild, K33 (son of K22). K pod was first seen this year on
February 21st, traveling up Swanson Channel with J pod. Photographs taken by Jeanne Hyde on Jim Maya's boat suggested the presence of a new K pod calf, but we were unable to confirm with any certainty. The
June 8 encounter with K43 confirms that the calf is at least 5 months old. The population of K pod is now 20 whales. This is the third calf born in 2010.

The

12:15 pm
Prince of Whales, 'Ocean Magic' vessel, out of Victoria encountered some of the
L 12's
at
False Bay, San Juan Island
. They were spread out far and wide and zig zagging all over with long dives. We had good glimpses of L 41 'Mega ' and a mom and a calf that appeared to be L 94 with her youngster L 113, who was showing off with many enthusiastic breaches (see photo of the day). We last saw them heading north toward Lime Kiln.

J pod
up north again today! It's been nice having them in the
Strait of Georgia
on a regular basis. They were very spread apart again today and we spent most of our day with J1 and J2. When we first arrived on scene though we had a mother and a calf briefly and I couldn't get an ID on them but I'm thinking it was J14 and J45. The calf did a couple breaches.

The reports were in, telling us to search near the
west side of San Juan Island
for a group of
L-pod orca whales
. We arrived at False Bay shortly after departing from Friday Harbor. From the sunny deck of the Sea Lion we saw a tall, glossy dorsal fin slice through the surface of the water. The scar half way down the dorsal fin hinted that we were looking at
L-41
"Mega". Mega was born in 1977, one year after the study of the Southern Resident Community had begun. We have been able to watch him grow from a small calf into the large adult male that we saw today. We continued south to view three other members of the pod near Lime Kiln State Park. The site was picture perfect. The orcas were swimming right in front of the Lime Kiln lighthouse and snow-capped Mount Baker was off in the distance.

At

4:45
I was out doing some flying and spotted
a gray whale
off of
Scatchet Head (SW Whidbey Isl)
! It was traveling to the Northwest, right off the drop off in front of the houses on the beach. The whale did not seem to be feeding, unless it was doing so in the deeper water. It seemed to be traveling at a fairly steady pace for the 15 minutes that I circled it.

The
Gray whale
is feeding in
Crescent Harbor, Whidbey Island
again this afternoon (6/8) - thanks to Joe Alicia for calling in the report - it was feeding close to shore at

3:40
, near the seaplane base in Oak Harbor. He also watched it on Sunday,
June 6 feeding close to shore in Crescent Harbor for 5 hours.
