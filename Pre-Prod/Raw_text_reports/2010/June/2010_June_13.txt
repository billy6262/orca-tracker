Orca Sightings for June 13, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have seen several
orcas
(6-8) at
Southern Pender Island
between
5pm - 6 pm
. Probably southern residents. We also saw a calf with them (K pod???). They were breaching at Gowlland Point. Later swam around, where currents meet, probably they were feeding. Regards,

Pt. Roberts
is a fantastic land-based whale watch park with often long passes, hanging out for foraging/socializing and less intrusive boat traffic. Today it was 2 hours until the last
orcas
were out of sight. One group spent over 30 minutes foraging in the South Beach "Bay" as commonly seen. As they first approached a little one porpoised and an adult breached. They were very spread out in stormy seas that were calming under a beautiful blue sky. Some were very close off the park. I saw one do a flip as several met up. J2 "Granny" (estimated birth 1911) was close to shore while J1"Ruffles" (estimated birth 1951) was a bit further ahead. Near the end it was J14 (born 1974) with her baby J45 (born Feb/
March 2009).

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called at

6:30 pm
to report they had
J pod
beginning to pass south in front of the Center (NW
San Juan Island
).
*
On Maya's Westside Charters

3:00pm
, we met with some
J pod
whales and 4
K pod
whales in
Boundary Pass
heading south. These 4 K pod whales - K21, K40, K16 and K35 - were with all of J pod when they were last seen on Thursday
June 10. After a 2 day absence it was great to see them again. However, I am not sure if all of J pod was present. Those seen by us were the J1, J2, J14s, J16s, J8, J19 and J41 and the 4 K pod whales. The J11s, J17s and J22s...hum where were they? These three groups had split from the rest last week for a day. I'm not sure if that happened again or not. Maybe someone got a picture of one of the J11s, J17s or J22s yesterday. See my blog for pictures from the encounter.

We spotted three members of our
Southern Resident orca community
when we arrived at
Monarch Head
BC. There was a female orca traveling with a subadult and a calf. Our good luck continued when we saw one of the whales breaching about 200 yards away, giving us a great view of its glossy belly. As we followed the whales south we identified the male orca J-26 "Mike". This 19 year old juvenile was given his nickname after the whale researcher Mike A. Bigg who passed away in 1991. Our next stop was Turn Point on Stuart Island. Captain Mike stopped the boat and I lowered our high-tech hydrophone into the water, enabling our lucky crew to hear the whales communicating. Listening to their serenading vocalizations made for one of the most peaceful days I have experienced on the water. Sunkissed and blissed we returned back to Friday Harbor.

There was a small group of
orca's
off
Brookes Point - south pender island
this afternoon. between
1pm and 5pm
. There was a second group closer to 5pm that were happily on their own with no whale watching boats around. they appeared to be feeding and circling the same spot.

After "disappearing" up north for two days,
J-Pod
came back down today. We were lucky enough to be the ones who found them after an earlier sighting from a BC ferry. What a special treat! I figured we would have to run all the way up to Pt. Roberts, in less than perfect conditions, to find them. Instead, we found the whales at
East Pt.
in flat calm water under sunny skies.

Carrie Newell of Whale Research Excursions in Oregon called to report the
orcas
that were observed previously off Depoe Bay, OR were seen off
Government Pt, N. of Depoe Bay
at 8 am this morning. She observed 2 females, 1 young male & a calf.

I remembered the day's report on a gray being seen in Polnell Shores area. We continued our search in the
Polnell Pt.
area and just N.E. of Polnell Shores, whale spout and a boat load of EXCITEMENT. We watched the
gray
as it stayed in same area feeding on sand/ghost shrimp close to shore. Observations, included, lots of swirling activity, with flippers and fluke sticking above water. Fed as a "right sided" gray; as we could see several times it twist/spiral onto its right side to suction the shrimp. All captured on film. Mid June gray in this area is something. We would not have been able to capture this memorable experience, without your faithful daily reports. Would not have gone searching, unless, we had heard grays are still around. And, here we are, nearing mid June.
