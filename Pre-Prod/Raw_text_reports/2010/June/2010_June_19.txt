Orca Sightings for June 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of
J-K-L
, the Southern Resident Community of Killer Whales, came in from the Strait of Juan de Fuca up
Haro Strait
, just in time for summer! There was a bit of wind and waves, which the whales swam powerfully and gracefully through.

11:30 pm
- Listening to many
whistles, calls, squeaks & mews
on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
- maybe some of the So. Resident Superpod still hanging around?! Cool listening!

Another day FULL of orcas off Hannah Heights, W San Juan Island! Beginning with hearing many blows from

12:30 -
1:30 am
, coming from all directions, possibly heading north but difficult to tell when you can't see anything. Then we began the day with
orcas off Hannah Heights at 9 am
, a small pod of Js heading north with some calves, but just passing through, not stopping to play like the previous day.
10:10 am a large male (J27?) traveling north with several females and a juvenile.
12:10 pm, 3 males and several females heading north.
12:35 pm, a larger group of Js and ? passed by heading south, foraging (heard J8). Then from

1:35 - 3 pm a large group mainly trending north hung out off Hannah Heights foraging, mating, actively milling back and forth, first close to shore then later further out. J1, J2 and family formed a resting line and headed north close to shore, and other started to group up. At
3:10 pm, most came back closer to shore, heading north up to Land Bank at
3:30, Js and Ls close in to shore. We haven't had time to go through our thousands of photos yet for IDs, but will post photos and IDs over the next few days.
We also heard reports that the L pod whales that had been up in Johnstone Strait
June 17th came back via San Juan Channel and Friday Harbor where they surprised many townspeople! Unfortunately no whales showed up for OrcaSing, but a few porpoise and a lot of people were there to enjoy the music and beautiful evening at Lime Kiln State Park.

One of the best days ever today! We had members of both
J Pod and mostly L Pod
today! Breaching, non-stop socializing and playing, we even saw a female spyhop and she vocalized with her head out of the water.....never heard it from above water before, It was amazing!

Faint
orca calls
on the
LimeKiln hydrophone
at

12:26AM
. Using the sound archives, I believe we've got members of J pod near the LimeKiln hydrophone tonight.

2 orcas
, no idea of sex , but both about same size, fairly large.
1940
, about 200 meters off the shoreline due north from the east end of
Skunk Bay
, just west of Hansville, on the north tip of Kitsap peninsula (N47-53/W122-34). Direction of travel uncertain. Appeared to be playing. Stayed in sight for 20 minutes, then disappeared, I think west. I reported a pair here several years ago. Sorry for no more info.

Orca Network received a call from David Riddle of Pt. Roberts, reporting a
Gray whale
50 yards off Lighthouse Pt, the S tip of
Pt. Roberts
, WA at around

7:45 or 8 pm

We spotted a single adult
gray whale
off the south west beach of
