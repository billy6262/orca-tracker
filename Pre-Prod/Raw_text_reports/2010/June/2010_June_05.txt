Mike Grady left a vm report seeing approximately
8 orca
off Lighthouse Point, Port Townsend around
5 pm
Saturday. He said it looked 2 calves included in the group.

At
1300
the
Js
were extremely spread out off the Tsawassen Ferry Dock. From nearly one side of Georgia Strait to another. They appeared to be focused on food searches. Off Lighthouse Marine Park, Point Roberts a male lunged after a meal within 50 feet off the beach. The water was shallow and he might have rubbed the bottom. He then bolted past the Lifeforce boat perhaps after that big one that got away. Orcas in the "Point Roberts Bay" spend a lot of time foraging. This is a critical habitat area where orcas forage and socialize if not disturbed by boat traffic. Caution is advised when travelling in this area. Many Js grouped up when approaching East Point at approximately
1600
. At approximately
1700
the J orcas were heading west in
Boundary Pass
off Java Rocks while Ruffles, Granny and others passed East Point, Saturna Island. As Lifeforce waited for all to pass Ruffles breached twice. As L, K and Js head back into Haro Strait and others are in Georgia Strait on
June 6th it is " to be continued".

We'd received word of
Transient Orcas
several nautical miles
Southeast of Hein Bank
heading towards Puget Sound. Once on scene we encountered the
T-30's, T-102
and others actively hunting a Harbour Seal (always thrilling to watch them give chase) on this day, however, the Harbour Seal outsmarted these intelligent creatures by 'jumping' up onto the Starboard engine 'water jet' of the Victoria Clipper III to seek refuge. After several minutes the Transients swam on in search of other food sources, but the poor little Seal spent the next 25 minutes resting on top of the water jet of the Victoria Clipper. The vessel was dead in the water as they were not able to start the engines, so for approximately 25 minutes the Captain and crew of the Clipper attempted to get the reluctant Seal to return to the water. The seal finally returned to the water once the whales were miles away. Never seen this before !!! Brilliant encounter with the whales today as we saw lots of Breaches, Dolphin Leaps, Tail Flips and had great vocalizations.

We were on the wrong side of the pod for good ID photos, their dorsal shadow somewhat obscures their saddle patches. However I'm sure you or Dave will know these guys by the shape of their dorsals, one leans to the right, and another's tip seems to point forward. When we left they were still heading south west (we were directly west of
Partridge Point, Whidbey Island
, 2 or 3 miles out, hard to tell, when we left them). We also saw a minke fairly close to Minor Island on the return to Anacortes.

We just got this report from Rod Whitten who observed
3-5 killer whales
chasing sea lions northwest of the entrance to
Grays Harbor
@

19:00
. One individual had a very tall and straight dorsal fin. He wasn't able to get any photos, but I will refer him to the photo ID guide of Transient killer whales that you have on the website, because he is eager to identify at least one of the whales.

David Dawley called Orca network about
2 - 3 orcas
very close to the beach on the South end of
Mutiny Bay
, on the Whidbey side of Admiralty Inlet,
at 9 pm
.
*
John Fortin called Orca Network at

8:44 pm
to report seeing o
rcas headed south
past
Useless Bay
, Whidbey Island, headed south.
*
At

5:27 pm
Erick Peirson called to say the
orcas
were just off
Pt. Hudson
, Port Townsend.
*
Christopher Kennedy with WA State Ferries relayed a report from the Chief Mate of the Steilacoom II that at

5:30 pm orcas
were seen 1/4 from the buoy at the entrance to
Port Townsend
just off Pt. Hudson.
*

5:03 pm
- Bob Whitney called from Port Townsend with a report of
transient orcas
"loitering" between
Pt. Wilson and Marrowstone Island
, heading south.
*
The Ocean Magic left Victoria to head south and east to view
9 Transient Orca
that had been reported. With Transients traveling in a straight line made for perfection as they headed further south toward
Admiralty Inlet
. We were at East Bank. It appeared that the
T30's
were there,
T30A
the big bull, and another big male, possibly
T103
. He was even bigger than T30A. Not sure who the other females were.

With reports from Jill Hein and Erick Peirson of a group of
10 - 12 transient orcas
headed south off
Partridge Point
, Whidbey Island around
2 pm
, I headed to Ft. Casey, opposite Pt. Wilson at the entrance to Admiralty Inlet to watch for them. Having no luck after an hour scanning the horizon, I was about to leave my perch on the bluff when I looked down and saw a suspicious dark gray fin slicing the water just 30 feet from the waves lapping the beach. Within seconds a second fin swished up about 20 feet from the first and I realized
a small gray whale was searching for food
at my feet. That was at

3:40pm
, and from there I accompanied this whale for about a mile down the beach,
around Admiralty Head and almost to the Keystone ferry dock
, whereupon the whale turned south and
headed toward Lagoon Point at
4:35pm
. The whale repeated the pattern of swimming a few hundred yards, then rolling on its side in typical feeding activity, then moving on to the next prospective meal. Since this is not known to be a place where grays have fed before, and the whale never stayed in any one place after one feeding attempt, I'm assuming this gray whale is unfamiliar with the best feeding spots and probably didn't find much.

Whale passing
Lagoon Pt.
6:30 pm.
We just saw
a whale
surface right
in front of the canal at Lagoon Pt
. The small dorsal fin alerted us at first, it circled at the mouth of the canal, and surfaced with a spout, but we couldn't get a good look. Maybe a Minke???? Did anyone else catch a sighting?
Gene and Merilyn Ohlson
From the timing and the sighting, this was probably
the same gray whale
I saw at Admiralty Head, heading south at
4:35. hg
*

16:34 - half dozen orcas
over near buoy north of
Pt. Wilson
seem to be foraging/breaching and heading south toward Pt. Townsend.....

Ken Balcomb at the Center fror Whale Research had
J pod
coming past the
west side of San Juan Island
at
9 pm
.
*
We found
J pod
in the
Strait of Georgia
and they were very spread out from the south arm of the fraser river all the way to the east point of point roberts. They were foraging the whole time we were there and going on some pretty deep dives. We were lucky to spend time with the big boys of
J pod, J1, J26, J27 as well as J16 and J42
. Let's hope there's lots of fish around for them!

J Pod
was southbound today in
Georgia Strait
, passing right by the Fraser River as our trips headed out. Lots of breaching, some spyhops, great vocals, and a little foraging observed. We left them southbound, somewhat spread out, going past the Tsawassen ferry terminal in the early afternooon. Both new calves,
J46 and J47
, were seen with their moms.
