Orcas
were around
Lime Kiln State Park
around
4 p.m.
a few meters south of the "Whale Watching Side" in Lime Kiln, just north of Dead Mans Bay. The orcas came from south and where heading north and came really close to the rocks.

Today we saw
J34
Doublestuf along with a few other J's on the south end of
San Juan Island
. J34 came along side of us and I took a picture of him, and upon reviewing that picture I noticed a very pronounced depression behind his blowhole. I've heard of peanut heads, but I don't think I've ever actually seen one. I'm guessing that is what this is, and am wondering how "bad" it is (see photo above)? I know some of the residents have had peanut heads in the past and come back from it, so lets keep our fingers crossed that Doublestuf and the rest of his family are finding a lot of Chinook!

Happy to report that word from the Center for Whale Research is that J34 has been seen several times looking fine and looks OK in this photo.

It is
8am
and low and behold,
Orca
trilling off in the distance on
Lime Kiln
. I can just hear them above the noise of the boat passing by. It is going to be a lovely day on the water again even if it is raining, and those Resident whales are around. I can hear them whistling and echo locating too.

Today at

5:30am
I was lucky enough to be awoken by
J pod
traveling north off of
Hannah Heights
on absolutely calm waters, their blows echoing up the hillside. They were spread out and between 50 and 300 yards offshore.

Off the west side of San Juan Island on the 3.30pm Ocean Magic out of Victoria, we headed over to where it had been reported that
members of J Pod were seen foraging
. Sure enough we saw
Ruffles
by himself close to shore, but most of our time was spent with
Polaris, J28 and her little one, J46
. There we saw three rambuncous youngsters, tail lobbing, breaching, backward swimming, spyhopping as well as mothers demonstrating very active behaviours. It was lovely to see these members of this productive family group all together. Totally awesome encounter, made even better with calm conditions and plenty of sunshine.
