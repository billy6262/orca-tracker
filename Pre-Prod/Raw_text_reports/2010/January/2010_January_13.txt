Here's a continuation of Mark's sighting (above). I received a call from Mark Malleson around 1315 of transients off Seabird Pt. heading east. I arrived on scene at 1420 and joined Mark who had
T93 and T97
still heading easterly. Mark left soon afterwards and I stayed with the pair for another hour as they continued east in the great wide open on a line between Seabird Pt. on Discovery Island and Iceberg Pt. on Lopez Is. Other than one brief period of milling around
1526
(I could not confirm a kill here), they kept heading east at a slow to medium pace. I left them at
1537
, closer to Hein Bank than Salmon Bank pointed toward Iceberg Pt.
