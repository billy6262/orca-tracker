Orca Sightings for January 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I were walking the famous white dog Abby at
Point No Point
(N. Kitsap Peninsula) and a
gray whale
surfaced just 25 feet from us. It was

1:40
today so the tide was fairly low, we were walking a water's edge, right next to the lighthouse and there it was!
