Orca Sightings for January 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb was stuck on shore on New Year's Day, 2010 when
J pod
came in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
and passed by the Victoria waterfront heading east in mid-
afternoon
. Using "big-eyes" (25x binoculars), he could unequivocally identify several individuals, including J1, but digital photos taken at 3 miles were unconvincing. Fortunately, Mark Malleson was out on the water and in contact by radio, so he took a photograph of J1 to document the observation for us.

We listened to
J pod
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
from about
6 -
6:10 pm
, making intermittent calls.

It's the first day of the year, and the first whales I have heard for 2010 are
J Pod
!!! They have been vocalizing (
Lime Kiln, W.San Juan Island
) for about 30 minutes (from ~

5:30 - 6 pm
). Very faint calls, but I'll take what I can get!

Great way to start the New Year with
Jpod
making an appearance coming in from the west. Found them at
1040
just west of
Race Rocks
very spread out heading east. I last saw them at
1520
within a mile south of Ogden Point Breakwater still spread out with J1 leading the charge.

A gale to 40 knots is forecast for today, but Mallard (Mark Malleson) squeaked out and found
J pod
inbound this morning before the storm.
