Orca Sightings for January 15, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jan. 13 - 15 - I live at Witter Beach,on the east side of the Whidbey Island and south of
Langley
by two miles and 4 miles north of the ferry. My neighbor had said that he had heard a
gray whale
out in front of our places two mornings in a row on Wednesday and Thursday and around 4'ish in the morning and that it had hung around for quite awhile feeding. Well, Friday morning around 7'ish I looked out and there he was! He was feeding right in front of our place and hung around for a bit and then headed south and later I saw him heading back north. He spy hopped and fed. We regularly have one particular whale come by and feed off of our beach and i am wondering if it is the same one - couldn't tell from the sighting on Friday if it was or not.
