Orca Sightings for January 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I talked with Roger this morning. He told me that someone he talked to last night said they saw
orcas
off the
Bremerton Ferry
around
4pm
, but did not know which direction they were going.

During encounter with
J pod
in Puget Sound, Mark Sears brought to our attention that there was likely a
new calf
present. An initial assessment of the photos collected by Mark, Candi Emmons and Jeff Hogan, indicated that J35 did have a new calf with her. Based on the information collected, The Center for Whale Research was able to confirm these observations and designated
J35's new calf as J47
. J35, born in 1998, is a relatively young mother, so it will be important to keep tabs on these two whales. Thanks for everyone's effort on this as it reinforces the importance of winter observations of these pods.

We caught up with the whales
(J pod
) just north of
3 Tree Point
and stayed and with them until about
1600
when they were a mile or so NE of the
Vashon
) ferry terminal heading north slowly - one small fecal sample for the day - lots of white caps.

I saw the heads up on the West Seattle Blog, and walked over to our spotting scope. Sure enough, there are about 7-8 [
orcas
] slowly heading north. Closer to Blake than Fauntleroy, (
Vashon
) but clearly visible with a scope. 3-4 leading the pack and a few others not far behind. They are about half way up Blake now (

4:30 pm
).

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at

12:30 pm
to relay a report of
orcas
off
Maury Island
heading toward Pt. Robinson. At

12:53 pm
she had found the whales, J pod, heading north from S. Maury Island - they had just passed the Pt. Robinson Lighthouse. They were moving slowly, closer to the Maury/Vashon side of the sound. She saw J1 and an orange, newer calf. At

1:25 pm
they were at Three Tree Pt, moving a bit faster, at

2:45 pm
they were at Dilworth, mid-channel, still heading north. The NOAA boat was with them (see above report). By 4 pm the orcas were passing through the Vashon Island ferry lanes, continuing north.

2:57 pm:
I have been watching the
orcas
from
Vashon island
across from the airport. They just left my sight about 6 minutes ago. They were coming from south and much closer to the Seattle shoreline than our island. There we several 7 or 8 in all - combination of a 1 or 2 males males, females and looked like a young one. They were moving at a leisurely clip and then looked like they might have been eating towards the end and staying in one area for a bit. Absolutely awesome to spot one of these majestic creatures in their natural habitat - doing what they do best - Just BEING. My heart is full :o)
Staci Housum, Vashon Island

I saw 4-5
Orca
whales this morning looking north towards
Vashon Island
from my home in Old Town Tacoma. About
11 am
, they entered Commencement Bay, traveling East. A very large one breached at least three times, and once was all of the way out of the water!!

@
noon
initially saw a number of orca headed north about 300 yards from our kayak; we were 1/2 mile north of McCurdy Point in the Straits (just west of
Pt. Townsend
). We couldn't tell how many at that time but there were at least 5; at least one large fin. A mother and calf then came very close to us, within 30 feet as they swam by heading south toward the shore. They stopped and appeared to be playing, surfacing and circling very close to each other. We were awestruck. The mother and calf eventually headed east about 200 yards from the shoreline and toward Point Wilson. Long. -122.84404 Lat 48.15555

Had more
transients
this afternoon south of
Victoria
west bound.
T063
aka "Chainsaw",
T065B, T036, T036B, and T028A
were among 8 or 9 individuals. Still working on the rest of the ID's. I left them south-west of Race Rocks at
1510
.

On the
afternoon
tour Mallard found 3
Transients
approx. 3nm South of VH (right off
Victoria
) !! After spending some time with these three individuals, I spotted 6 others a few miles Southeast of our location. Upon arrival, I confirmed T-63 (Chainsaw) with others. Tentative ID's were found to be T-63, T-65B, T-36, T-36B and T- 28A. Will confirm with Mark later once he looks at his photos. The nine animals tracked Southwest of Race Rocks and we left them at 1520 hrs. 2.7nm Southwest of lighthouse headed West.
