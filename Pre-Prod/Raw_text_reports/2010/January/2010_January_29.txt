Orca Sightings for January 29, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod came south in Haro Strait this morning (Jan. 29 @ 0930) spread out over many miles as far as we could see. Dave Ellifrit, Jeanne Hyde, and Ken Balcomb headed out in r/v "Orca" to check on the new baby whales and evaluate body condition of pod members. By early afternoon the whales were traveling west in the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca still very spread out with the nearest whale to shore (J26) about two miles SSE of Discovery Island, BC as we left them at 1230. We confirmed that J1,J2, and J44-47 babies were all present and in good body condition. The other whales were so dispersed that we did not find everyone, but there was no reason for concern given all that we saw appeared to be in good body condition. One Chinook salmon scale was found in trail of J1 later in the day after Mark Malleson saw him chase and catch a fish south of the Victoria waterfront. We did not see the whales catching many fish today- they were mostly searching.

Postscript: A little over a week later (Feb 8th and 9th), fishing was slow at the 2010 Roche Harbor Salmon Classic Invitational with 43 salmon caught, and the biggest being a 16 pound hatchery Chinook. For perspective, compare that with the 1976 (all year) sport catch of Chinook salmon (all wild) of 55,248 fish from the San Juan Islands, and the 1986 (all year) sport catch of 30,208 fish from the islands! The commercial salmon fishery in Washington State landed 782,000 Chinook salmon in 1976, and 422,000 Chinook salmon in 1986. The average weight of a Chinook salmon commercially landed in those years was about 15 pounds, and derby winners in the sport fisheries routinely exceeded 40-50 pounds! Clearly, the times have changed for the salmon, and for the whales that depend upon the salmon for survival. Of course, things have changed for the fishermen, too.

We encountered
J Pod
this afternoon around
2pm
, 2-3 miles west of the ODAS Buoy (eastern
Strait of Juan de Fuca
). They appeared to be very spread out but when seen, they were traveling in close family groups. It seems there were babies everywhere especially when one counts J44 and J45, the yearlings. We saw J26 and Echo J42, breech off in the distance when we arrived. The J14 family group with J 30, followed and then some of the other family groups. We were unable to ID Granny, J2, nor J8. J Pod's big boy, Ruffle, J1 was off by himself fishing. All in all, it was a fabulous trip out to see one of our favourite Orca Pods.

This morning at

8:54
I began to hear
sounds
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
and there was definitely more than one whale vocalizing! It was
J Pod
and they were coming down from the north. They were spread out across
Haro Strait
. It was wonderful to see Ruffles with Granny and the rest of J Pod. I went out with Ken and Dave of the Center for Whale Research looking particularly for the new babies and to get IDs on as many as we could considering weather and time constraints. Here are a few pics (see above and photo of the day) and I have posted more on my blog. All babies accounted for!!!

Sharon Grace called to say she'd watched
J pod
head south past
Land Bank
, spread out at about

11:20 am
- it looked like one whale may have been heading west, but most appeared to be southbound. The "nursery" group was furthest out, she saw all 3 calves, 1 tail-slapping like a humpback! J1 and Blackberry were past Pile Pt. Also observed some breaching and foraging off Hannah Heights.
*

10:25 am
:
Ruffles
is in the lead,
Hannah Heights
area, and
Granny
too.
Sandy Buckley, San Juan Island

9:59 am
: Jeanne Hyde called to say
J pod
is coming down
San Juan Island
from the north,
J1 & J2
present. J1 is now about a half mile offshore of the
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. Sighs of relief and tears of joy!

9:26 am:
I hear lots of nice vocals at
orcasound
but see no whales over a very flat calm sea. Vocals are on
Lime Kiln
and
Orca Sound
so perhaps the orcas are in between.

Granny (J2)
nail a salmon in front of the Center and
Ruffles (J1)
is with her!

I am listening to
