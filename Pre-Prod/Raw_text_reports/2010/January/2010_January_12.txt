Orca Sightings for January 12, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I came across
Transient
orcas
T097, T093 and T124C
in the afternoon east bound off of
East Sooke Park
(S Vancouver Island). I left them entering Race Passage at
1550hrs
still east bound against a strong ebb current.

In the gloomy
afternoon
light and hugging the westcoast shoreline near
East Sooke Park
, Mark Malleson's 1pm Zodiac suddenly came across a distant, disappearing dorsal fin. We watched for a while and three dorsal fins eventually showed. These three were traveling together, two big males and a female. They were heading east along the shoreline for a while and then headed out toward the south. At one point they did appear to be hunting something, based on their behaviour. The center for Whale research along with Mark later IDd the three as BC, Transients.
T124C, and T93 AND T97

Another great winter trip today as Mallard found
3 Transients
off of Secretary Island this afternoon. At Approximately
1440
hrs., I arrived on scene 0.5 nm South of Beechey Hd. (
East Sooke Park
) to find two large males,
T-93 and T-97
, respectively being escorted by a single female (
T-124C
). The group of three were travelling consistently to the East at a good clip (4-6 kts.) During my stay with the animals, we saw two seal kills which T-124C made. All business and no play for this group; as we did not see any play behaviour or hear any vocals after they made the kills. We left the group at 1545 hrs. still headed East just inside Race Passage. Conditions today were foggy with light rain showers coupled with flat calm seas.
