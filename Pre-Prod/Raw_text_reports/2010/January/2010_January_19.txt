Orca Sightings for January 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cascadia Research Report on examination of stranded Bryde's whale in Puget Sound:
Rare whale strands in Puget Sound
A highly unusual stranding of a tropical Bryde's whale occurred in southern Puget Sound this week and an examination was conducted by Cascadia Research, WDFW, and NOAA. The whale was first reported floating dead on Saturday, 16
January 2010 and temporarily came ashore a couple of locations in southern Puget Sound over the next couple of days. The whale was towed to a remote location (thanks to the help of Taylor Shellfish) and a detailed examination conducted on the afternoon of 19 January.
This species primarily uses warmer tropical waters and in the eastern North Pacific has not generally been seen north of southern California. It appears to have been in Puget Sound several weeks because there had been several puzzling sighting reports going back at least to the beginning of January of a live whale roughly meeting the description of this whale. This is the first confirmed sighting or stranding of this species in the Pacific Northwest that we are aware of.
The whale was just under 39 feet and appeared to be an immature whale. Examination showed it had what appeared to be some healed propeller scars on its back and a likely entanglement injury on its fluke but both these were not serious and did not appear to play a role in the whales death. The whale had no food in its stomach or intestines and so did not appear to have fed in a while. The blubber layer was very thin and did not have much oil in it suggesting starvation may have played a role and possible exposure to cold (due to the small blubber layer and colder waters than is typical habitat for this animal).
Because the whale had died very recently, the tissues were very fresh and allowed a very detailed examination and sample collection. This included samples for biotoxin analysis, disease screening, contaminant testing, genetics, and histo-pathology. These tests will be run over the coming months and may provide additional insight into what the animal was doing here and why it died. More photos are on Cascadia Research's website

Update from Cascadia Research on response to
dead whale
in So. Puget Sound, originally IDd as a Sei whale, but now believed to be a
Brydes whale
: We responded on Sunday but the whale was mostly submerged and washed out overnight. It beached again yesterday afternoon near Vaughn and I was able to go out to take a look at it and secure it so we could tow it to a necropsy location today. We initially thought based on the dorsal fin shape that it was a sei whale, but when the animal was out of the water yesterday I was able to get a good look at the head and it appears to be a Brydes whale. This type of whale is usually found S of Northern California, so we're not sure what it is doing here. It's about 40 feet long, male, and we'll have more information on our website in the next couple of days after we are able to do a thorough examination.

Typically when large Fin or Sei whales wash up in Puget Sound, it means they've been struck by a large ship way out in the ocean and brought in on the bow of the ship - but this whale had not suffered any trauma, so that was not the case - so this has presented a very interesting case for researchers! They are testing the DNA to confirm the species, and will be posting more information on the Cascadia Research website, and we will post more info. as we receive it too.

Having a great time on vacation (in
Baja
) - have seen many
humpbacks
in the distance from shore and got a report from a fisherman friend that they had three orcas chasing thier bait, about 5 miles off shore at Los Barriles, looked to be a male, female and a small calf. He reported that it is not too unusual to see them around here-we are keeping our eyes on the horizon! Water is great, as is the snorkeling!
