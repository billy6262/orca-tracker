Orca Sightings for January 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw some
Orcas
today. There was somewhere between 4 and 10 of them and they were possibly eating (we heard some harbor seals around) and they were heading north from the
Point Robinson lighthouse on Vashon Island
. They were far out so we didn't see anything distinguishing and they were definitely moving. This was around

12:30pm
.

Carolyn Graye called Orca Network at
5 pm
to report seeing what looked like
6 orcas
from
Loman Beach, West Seattle
. They looked too big to be porpoise, but small for orcas, some dorsal fins were larger than others, and they were heading south. She also emailed this to our Facebook page: There were about 6 marine critters north of Lowman Beach in West Seattle right before sundown today. They dove and foraged for about 20 minutes, gradually moving south. They seemed too small to be orca.

About

9:30 a.m.
off Kamilche Point in
Totten Inlet
(South Puget Sound). Only saw 1 dorsal fin and one spout (simultaneous). Appeared to be heading South.

Saw a
gray whale
while scuba diving off the shore of
West Seattle
, at a location called the Alki Pipeline. The whale was about 75 ft beyond the outlet of the pipeline. The approximate latitude and longitude are: Latitude = 47.5703, Longitude = -122.4160. The sighting occurred around
noon
, approximately 350 yd from shore in water approximately 30 ft deep. The gray swam directly in front of us, approximately 10 ft away. It appeared to be investigating us. The estimated length of the whale is about 25-30 ft. It was swimming in a southerly direction. The belly of the whale was about 2-3 feet off the bottom. It was swimming slowly, and left a trail of disturbed sediment behind it. It had mottled white markings (what appeared to be barnacles) around its mouth and back and on its side fin (I only saw its right side). Only one whale was seen, but visibility was poor (about 15 ft). People sitting on the shore did not report seeing any blows. It also swam in front of a second group of divers from the Seattle Fire Dept. that were in the water in this area at the same time. This was scary enough. Would not care to see an Orca this close.
