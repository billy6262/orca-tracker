Orca Sightings for July 29, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving reports of whales coming down from
Turn Point
, center staff Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit and Emma Foster departed in Shachi. The water conditions were very rough with a lot of chop and wind waves.
K12, K43 and K37
were the first group encountered (at

2:57 p.m
. - 48째 58.37 N; 123째 20.31 W). K26 was seen breaching several times. The next group encountered was a mixed group containing
K14, K42, J1, J2, J19, K12, K43, K37
and others. We also saw
J33 and J36 close to J26, J16 and J42
who were also traveling together. The final group encountered was
K13, K20, K38, K34 and K25
. All whales were traveling quickly south. There were reports of more whales off Turn Point but due to rough conditions and incoming fog we ended the encounter still off Kellett Bluff (48째 58.436 N; 123째 20.31 W) at

3:52 p.m
.

As we neared Stuart Island the orca whales were traveling south down
Haro Strait
. We traveled parallel to the direction they were heading along the west side of San Juan Island. We identified J-1 "Ruffles", J-16 "Slick", and J-30 "Riptide". There are 28 members of the
J-pod
, with 4 new calves in the last year. The whales were active today; we observed a few breaches and a lot of tail slapping.

Lots of
orcas
southbound along the west side of
San Juan Island
this
afternoon
. I managed to get a few photos from shore before the fog covered the water like a thick blanket.

Orca
calls
were reported off
OrcaSound hydrophone
(NW San Juan Island) at

3:30 pm
by Jeff Hogan - he had
J's and K's
headed south, S1 and S16 calls on Lime Kiln, also in front of the Center for Whale Research. A large group of orcas, possibly
L pod
, was headed west past Sooke this morning. I am just beginning to hear a few calls off Lime Kiln now, at

4:10
.

There was a
gray whale
feeding just south of the
Fauntleroy
dock this morning about
9 AM
putting on quite a show for those waiting for the ferry.

Donna Sandstrom called this morning to report that they had also observed a baleen whale with a heart-shaped blow (sounds like
a Gray
) while watching the
Transients
off
Restoration Pt.
7/28 The Transients were heading N while the Gray whale was heading S. Then Karol Sample saw the Gray whale from Me-Kwa-Mooks park in
W. Seattle
this morning (7/29) at
11 am
, heading north. She said it appeared to be a juvenile, so it is likely not the same Gray that had stranded off of Everett earlier in the month.
