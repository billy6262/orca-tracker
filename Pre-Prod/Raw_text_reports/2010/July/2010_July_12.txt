Orca Sightings for July 12, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had reports of
orcas
on the south side, but weren't sure they would come our way as we headed north in more comfortable waters, sighting bald eagles, harbor porpoise, harbor seals, and marine birds along the way. As we rounded to the west,
J-Pod
families, with J-2 Granny, classically in the lead, displayed many of the behaviors we had been talking about, as if on cue! Our guests were delighted, and our timing spot on, for the smoothest conditions and seeing the whales! We also had quite a few children on board and since these killer whales are listed as endangered I asked a group if they knew what 'endangered' meant. One little girl thought for a moment and said "that means they need something". What a great response. Yes, these whales need Chinook salmon, clean water, and our care and respect! Little J-45 Se-Yi'-Chn, capped off our trip with four consecutive breaches! The day was filled with hope and magic.

Fortunately for us, by the time we got out to the west side of
San Juan
to view the whales, the winds had abated somewhat and the seas were fairly calm. Just in time to see our wonderful whales of
J-Pod
. We thought we only had one or two whales near Kellett Bluff and so we waited to see who else might be around when suddenly the waters fairly sprouted 8-10 more whales that had been on a long dive!
J1
Ruffles was once again leading the pack, right next to
J2
Granny (what a good son!) We also saw J19 and her calf, J30 (a sprouter male that is getting huge!),
J27
Blackberry,
J8
Speiden (with her small dorsal fin and very distinctive blow!) The whales didn't seem to be in much of a hurry, and spent their time searching the tidal rips for something to munch on, and play around with each other. Soon we found ourselves just north of the Turn Point Lighthouse in the very cool upwellings, and we waited for the whales to arrive. And waited. And waited. And as I like to say on the boat, patience is usually rewarded, and boy was it! The whales had been fairly spread out before the lighthouse, and maybe it was the strong currents, but soon we had 12-15 whales coming up in a large group! A few cartwheels (by the whales, not the naturalists) were followed by some huge pectoral fin slaps by none other than J1 Ruffles! And then little J45 decided he'd show Ruffles how to do some pretty impressive breaches (4 of them to be exact)--full height followed by a landing on the belly! It was the perfect ending to a picture-perfect summer day.

A
gray whale
that has been stranded recently on Everett-area beaches was spotted heading toward C
amano Island
early this morning. Shortly before
6 a.m
., an eyewitness spotted the whale swimming freely at Mission Beach surfacing at regular intervals.

We were looking for the gray whale and found
orcas
and this morning, went out looking for the orcas and finally found the
gray whale
- I got some shots of it too!

- Multiple pod
calls
audible. The
A30s (Northern Resident orcas)
just went by the Lab (
OrcaLab, Hanson Island, N. Vancouver Island
) moving very slowly against the strong ebbing tide. But they were not alone. In the late evening light we watched another group, perhaps the C6s, adjust themselves into the back eddy close to hanson Island. They finally made way towards Johnstone Strait. We have not yet heard them. The tide will turn in about two hours so hopefully it will be come easier,
