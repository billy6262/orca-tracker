Orca Sightings for July 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Was out with Jim Maya with several
orcas
feeding and foraging in fog, so predicting where they were going to go was difficult. We were about mile off
San Juan Island
. Suddenly one emerged coming straight toward us and I got a series of head-on shots before it dove. It is dramatic from low on the water.

Active Pass
. Six whales, going against the tide, with some spy hops, half breaches, and tail slaps (will post photos in future reports).
