Orca Sightings for July 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Raese Reeves of WDFW, relaying a report he heard from some fishermen out of Seiku, WA, who had observed "a whole bunch" of
orcas attacking a Gray whale off Swiftsure Bank
. He gave us the number of Van Riper's Resort where the fishermen were staying, and we talked to one of the fishermen, JR Allen, who was on the boat, along with Rich Schuler. It was in the
morning
, 32 miles beyond Swiftsure (48 33.075N; 124 53.485W), in 10' seas. They were in a small fishing boat, when they saw 20 - 25 orcas, and a gray whale. The orcas were going after the Gray, 6 males getting in a line and ramming the Gray, which made "the damndest noise - like a hurt bull" when they rammed it. The Gray moved over next to the boat to try to escape the orcas, which put the boat in the middle of the action & suddenly they were surrounded by orcas trying to attack the gray whale, so they were trying to get out of there! As they were leaving, one of the orcas came up behind the boat and followed them for awhile. They were able to get about 9 minutes of video and will make a copy of it and send to us when he gets back home to Idaho next week. We'll let you know if the video enables any IDs of the Orcas or the Gray whale.
