to report 12
orcas
heading into
Active Pass
, the pod included 2 large males, and they seemed to be fishing.

A stop off in
Presidents Channel
to see a
minke
(he's been in the same area for nearly a week now) was just the cherry on top of our great day on the water.

The day was welcomed in with 69 degrees, sunny skies and blows of
whales
echoing off the absolutely flat, calm seas at

6:00 am
this morning. Before the whales made it into my sights I could see salmon literally jumping out of the water - which was interesting in and of itself. Slowly, members of
J and L pod
began passing close to shore- very spread out. I made my way to the
(Lime Kiln) lighthouse
hoping there would be a close pass. As I watched the whales near me, I could also see a lot of fins far offshore, some apparently heading in around Discovery and keeping to the Canadian side of the Haro Straits. I watched J's pass by intermingled with L's but then I see
a smattering of K's
in the groups as they continued to pass. It took about 30 minutes for the show to end - not a lot of activity but a few very close passes at the shoreline. I actually left the park and made it to landbank only to see a sight that made me stop in my tracks and return to the park. Just in time - a resting line of nearly 15 whales came by the shorelines, including Mega, Skana, Solstice, Calypso, Mystery, Canuck, Spirit---and another 6 I never even had a chance to see (wrong lens for wide angle shots)! But definitely a naptime for L pod!

K Pod
, who had been "summering" for the last month or so up in the Queen Charlotte's had appeared near
Lime Kiln
! For the first time this summer, we had all 3 pods together---a SUPER POD! They were making good time with a flood tide pushing them north, and we managed to catch up to the trailing group of about 20+ whales about 3 miles east of Eastpoint. The whales were working hard through the large rip tide at Boiling Reef, and we gave them extra room through the area so they could go where they wanted. Soon we were on the other side in much calmer waters, and the whales became more and more active as they got further from the strong rip. We saw K21 Cappucino swimming fairly close to L41 Mega. It was good to the see the big boys back in the area. We also had some Js in the mix. Soon K21 & L41 began swimming upside down with their enormous pectoral fins out of the water. It was so cool to be able to point out the large curl in their tail flukes. Soon this was followed by breaches, spyhops, cartwheels. It was amazing. It was as if one whale would try to "one-up" the activity of the others. The big treat for us was to see a mother and calf breach side by side at the same time about 250 yards away!!!
