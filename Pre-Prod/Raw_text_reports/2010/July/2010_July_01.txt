Orca Sightings for July 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were with the
southern residents
in
Swanson Channel
; they were swimming close together and there were lots of fins in the air at once--at one point I counted 15 on the surface simultaneously. We also saw the UW Center for Conservation Biology's boat with the orca scat sniffing dog successfully collecting a sample.

After watching
J's and L's
go by the Center for Whale Research (NW
San Juan Isl.
) around

7:30 a.m
, Ken Balcomb, Erin heydenreich, Emma Foster and Astrid van Ginneken departed Snug Harbor and caught up with the whales just off Kellett Bluff at

8:46 a.m.
(48째 60.197 N; 123째 20.528 W). The whales were spread out in mixed tight groups. We encountered most of
L pod
in two tight groups traveling slowly north. We had all the
L's
except the L2's, L54's and some of the L5's. The rest of the
J's
and possibly the other L's were presumably further north. The encounter ended at
10:20 a.m. off Stuart Island (48째 68.471 N; 123째 23.742 W).

I recorded a two-hour stay of some
Js
in the
Pt. Roberts
, WA south side bay. Previously times were approximately 1 hour and then later returns. We should call this critical habitat South Residents Orca Bay. The
July 1 Canada Day holiday began for Lifeforce as
orcas
were reported as heading north to
Active Pass
. Well it was a split so some of the orcas were off Lighthouse Marine Park at
3PM
heading south. They were very spread out and actively engaged in foraging and socializing. J28 and her baby were there with baby on her back and baby raising the head way out of the water. They moved back and forth generally heading south easterly but at 5PM they made one final turn and kept going heading back to the Fraser River. As whale watch company jargon goes, the others who were ahead as "leaders" followed and they became the "trailers". Now it was time to see if the trip north will be long or short by returning to the park in the dark to listen for their passing. It was a beautiful quiet night and at 2308 multiple blows were heard for about 30 minutes. The whoofs, whoofs, whoofs were a night time whale hear experience. Amongst the many, many blows one could hear some slaps and splashes.

along with many clicks were automatically recorded this morning (on the
OrcaSound hydrophone
, NW San Juan Island).

We got spoiled with
J pod
and some
K's
giving us an awesome show! Playing in the kelp beds, spyhopping, breaching - you name it, we saw it. We followed them from
Swanson Channel
and into
Active Pass
. It was a Canada Day that my passengers and I will never forget! Here are a couple pictures, one of a bellyflop from J16 entering the pass and another of a J Pod breach (see photo above) in the Active Pass.

We left the dock and we made our way over to the west side of
San Juan Island
where the
Orcas
were reported to be. We traveled south along the island watching the whales calmly moved along. They were in no rush as they occasionally changed direction and milled about. Their slow pace offered some wonderful views of these amazing animals.

This morning the show began just about

6:30am
- there were whales headed north very close to the shores of the west side of
San Juan Island
. I only saw a few at first but within 30 minutes I began to hear pec slaps and blows echoing up the hill. I ran outside to find LOTS of
J's and L's
spyhopping and rolling around in the kelp along the shoreline. Hoping they would stay close to shore I ran over to Lime Kiln and sure enough---group after group began languidly swimming by the rocky outcroppings, coming incredibly close to the shore. Lots of breaches, rolls, and tight family groupings. It was great to see so many L pod members I have not seen "up close" for a while- and the angle at which they passed the shore allowed many chances to see their faces as they rolled through the water.
