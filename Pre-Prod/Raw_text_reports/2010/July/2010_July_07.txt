Orca Sightings for July 7, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:32 PM
tuned in to
Lime Kiln hydrophones
to hear faint
calls
of SKRW's. 7 minutes later the chatter picked up. It was awesome!! With the whistles & chirps I thought I was in a Costa Rican rain forest. It was quiet by
7:48 PM except for the vessel passing by.

Lots of [
orcas
] today at Thieves Bay on
Pender Island, B.C.
They came by slowly in family groups of 3 or 5. Lots of spy hopping and tail slapping. One fellow had a hydrophone out and we listened to their squeals. Probably saw about 35 whales come by fishing. What a fabulous thing to see the whales so close. (10 or 20 feet away at times). All boaters were well behaved and kept their distance.

Whale
calls
and blows were heard off the Center for Whale Research at

3:30 a.m.
The whales were shuffling back and forth for a few hours. Center for Whale Research staff departed Snug Harbor at
6:05 a.m. and encountered the whales resting off
Bellevue Point
at
6:19 a.m. (48째 53.717 N; 123째 17.253 W). They were in two tight groups that came together and separated several times over the course of the encounter. We had all of
J pod, most of the L's
(excluding the L12's and a few others) and
K21, K40, K16, and K35
. They were resting and traveling slowly north against the tide off Bellevue Point for over 3 hours. As we left at

10:03 a.m.
(48째 54.19 N;123째 19.21 W) they started to pick up some speed and move further north, but later turned around, spread out, and went south.
