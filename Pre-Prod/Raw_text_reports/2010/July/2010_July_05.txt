Orca Sightings for July 5, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Granny, J-2, stills breaches at 99 years old!! She showed us her power and place as the grand matriarch of
J-Pod
(and the whole Southern Resident Community of Killer Whales) today, as she led the pod south from
Turn Point
. I wonder that she was communicating to the families to hurry up- catch up! Since the rest of the pod was spread out a mile or more, then they sped swam at about 15 miles an hour, porpoising, leaving wakes, until they reached Henry Island. All the families came closer together and slowed their pace as they went near shore right along the cliffs, probably hunting for salmon. Both of the newest calves kept up with the fast pace. Nothing cuter than watching orca babies leaping up right next to their moms and relatives!

We received a report of whales heading quickly south from
East Point
and departed Snug Harbor in two vessels, Shachi (with Ken Balcomb, Astrid van Ginneken, Pam Smith, and George Hamilton) and Eagle Dancer (with Mark Malleson, Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster). Eagle Dancer encountered
J1, J2, J8, J33, J19 and J41
, while Shachi documented the
J14's and J16's
just west of Kellet Bluff at ~

3:18 p.m
(48째 66.26 ; 123째 22.46 W). We then received another report of more whales coming down Boundary Pass. We first encountered
K16, K35, K40 and K21
spread out traveling south west off
South Pender Island
. We later encountered the
J17's
and the
J22's
. The encounter ended at Turn Point at
6:42 p.m. (48째 41.12 N; 123째 14.29 W).

We had [
orcas
] today in the
Strait of Georgia
, just north of Boundary Pass. Mostly
J's
but we had
K21 and K40
there too. Lots of breaching and tail slaps.

between Sooke and Sherringham,

It was a windy, choppy 4th of July holiday in
Southern Georgia Strait
. After the great orca passing on Canada Day
July 1st the
Js and Ks
returned
June 3, Saturday morning at approximately
0730
. The report to Lifeforce Whale and Dolphin Hotline said they were moving slow, foraging (circling) and one was belly up slapping the waters. When I arrived at
0840
I could still see them heading South. Orcas returned on
July 5th in the morning off Lighthouse Marine Park,
Point Roberts
while others were heading north in
Active Pass
. The Point ones were spread out taking long dives, doing some foraging, and a bit of socializing. One breached four times in approximately 5 minutes. At about
1200
there was another passing not close to shore and heading south.

Southern Residents possibly
K and L pod
headed east past
Tofino
at
1800
hrs.

[
Orcas
] were picked up at approximately
1600
hrs traveling very spread out east bound down the coast at Cleland Island which is about 4 miles southwest of
Tofino
. We viewed them for 1.5 hrs during which I think we saw some fishing, speed swimming with the swells, and socializing. A couple of breaches out of the male I sent the photo of as well. There were somewhere between 20-25 animals. I didn't see all because they were spread out over a mile or more. We left them passing Lennard Island Lighthouse, 1-2 miles offshore at 1800 hrs.

There were
over 100 blue and humpback whales
feeding, an exceptional number.

Here in Everett we spotted what appeared to be two (?)
gray whales
, possibly one much larger than the other. From the beach at Harborview Park below the train track, we saw the two whales last
night
. They seemed to be playing, coming as close as 40 feet to the shore, oblivious to the Lab dogs fetching water toys, kids with boogie boards and even the sound of the train. One appeared to be at least 30 feet long (?), both playing and flipping their tails which were black on the top and appeared white on the back side. The body of one appeared black, white, gray mottled. The tide was coming in around

7:30
as we observed them for a least 30 minutes, while they slowly swam east to the Everett Naval station from the west and just south of the Mukilteo ferry landing. One man with binoculars said it was the second day he had watched them "scraping barnacles off their bodies." When we finally left, they were still swimming close to the edges of the bulkhead just west of the storage silo before the navy base. I've never seen whales this close in Everett in some 35 years.

Jeff Hogan called Orca Network at

4:35 pm
to report orca
calls
on the
OrcaSound
(NW San Juan Island) hydrophones.
Also tuned into the Center for Whale Research Orca Cam and saw several orcas porpoising out of the water!
*
The first [
orca
] I heard (before I was out of bed this morning) was at
0630
and it's now
0750
and there are Orca still traveling past Mouat Point. Many small groups moving slowly (mainly) going North in
Swanson Channel
with several short changes of direction and some feeding behaviour. Several "barrel rolls", and tail slaps. Great way to start the day!

11:30 Gray whale
again close to shore between Harborview and Howarth Parks just off
Everett
. Very active rolling and blowing.
