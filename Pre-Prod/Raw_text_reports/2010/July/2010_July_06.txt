Orca Sightings for July 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported
J pod
spread out, passing the Center (NW
San Juan Island
) between

7:30 pm
and a little before
9 pm
. He had reports from Mark Malleson of
L pod
south of Victoria at
8 pm
heading in.
*
We met up with part of
J-pod
about 1 mile north of East Point on
Saturna
at

3:10pm
.
J2 "Granny" and J1 "Ruffles
were in the lead. As they headed for East Point we went ahead of them so we could watch as they traveled along the gorgeous Saturna shoreline. We also identified
J8 "Spieden"
she did a beautiful spyhop,
J19 "Shachi"
who did an amazing slow motion Belly Flop Breach. We had lots of breaches by the little ones off in the distance.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales (and SoundWatch - who is back on the water - yay!) called to report they were with part of
J pod
in
Active Pass

Entry 2:
J11s, J22s, and J17s
were heading north, but the rest of J pod was 3 - 5 miles south of them and heading the opposite direction!
*
Center staff woke to whale blows at

5:15 am
(NW
San Juan Island
) shortly departed in two vessels, Shachi (w/Ken Balcomb, Pam Smith, and George Hamilton) and Eagle Dancer (w/Mark Malleson, Emma Foster, and Astrid van Ginneken). Two groups of whales were encountered on the west side of Haro Straight (between Sydney and Henry Islands). The first group - encountered at

6:45 a.m
. (48째 60.93 N; 123째 23.98 W) - had
J31, J32 and J39. J27
was a little further off milling, he later joined the other three. The second group had
J22, J38 and J34
. Both groups were traveling north. The encounter ended at
7:54 a.m. at 48째 63.14 N; 123째 24.84 W. We received reports from whale watch operators that more members of J pod, along with
K21, K40, K16 and K35
were further north and heading through active pass.

Kristi Armstrong of the Port of
Everett
reported watching a whale (most likely a
Gray whale
) in the Port of Everett near the south terminal, SW of the big dome, about 20' from shore in shallow water late Tuesday
afternoon
. It stayed in the same area the 30 minutes she watched it, it wasn't rolling or feeding, but was spouting. We have had many reports of a Gray whale or two still in the area, feeding in the Everett area, so our guess is that either the whale was resting between feeding times, or that it may have become stuck in an area of shallow water and was waiting for the tide to come back in before moving on (it was an incoming tide when we received the call, and no other reports of the whale in that location have come in since) - sb.
