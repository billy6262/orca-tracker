Orca Sightings for July 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here is a photo of
L25
Ocean Sun (see below under "Save the Date"), taken in the evening.. It was taken somewhere on the south/west side of
San Juan island
. The Js and the Ls were all spread out in the area, with lots of surface activity. It was a great day!! We were close to the minke that some of the orcas were interacting with, mentioned in a previous report. It popped up right by the boat!

6:15 pm:
lots of [
orcas
] to begin the holiday weekend today- pretty sure there were members of
all three pods
- lots of breaching and a nice close pass to shore by an entire family group right out front (Hannah Heights,
W San Juan Island
). Hung for a while too...oh the joy! Happy 4th!

1) We were shut down off
Andrews Bay
watching the whales foraging and after being under about 3-4 minutes,
Granny
surfaced immediately along our port mid-ships and then dove under the boat and resurfaced grasping a salmon, flashing silver in the midday sun. Everyone on board cheered her success! 2)On our evening whale watch off Eagle Pt., we watched for about 15 minutes;
J27, L41,L25, L12
and a few other orca AND a young
Minke
swimming together. Certainly two rare sighting treats for the day!

We traveled north to meet the whales traveling down the west side of
San Juan Island
. The nice weather and holiday brought out many boaters who were also excited to observe the
Orcas
. After reaching the whales we recognized
Cappuccino
and
Raggedy
from the
K pod
. The whales were very widely spread along the west side of the island and traveling south. Even though the whales were far apart they could still remain in communication with each other. We often deploy our hydrophone to listen in to these private underwater conversations. Each of the different pods sound distinct and researchers are capable of identifying the pods just by listening to them.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report
J pod
and some
K pod
members were heading south down the west side of
San Juan Island
at

2:47 pm
.
L pod
was heading in from further west, and it appeared they might all meet up at Lime Kiln Park.
