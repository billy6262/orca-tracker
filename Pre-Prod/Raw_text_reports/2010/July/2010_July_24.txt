============================================================

Entry 1:
At
3 pm
, while paddling about one half mile east of
Iceberg Point
we were passed by a
minke
traveling steadily eastward.

I saw a
minke
right outside of the entrance to
friday harbor
-- 'twas Johnney Rotten! It was at about
2
- he was bookin' out of town, we lost him

There was a
Minke
up in "Minke Lake" (N. of
Stuart Island
) this afternoon (around

4:30 PM
). Didn't get a real good look at it though. Lot's of bait balls around.

We were so excited to observe approximately
20 Orcas
passing by
Point Roberts
between

5:30 and 7 pm
. The whales were quite spread out, heading South, and moving steadily in pairs. A few of the whales were swimming back and forth with some tail lobbing. There were at least three large males present; we also spotted two calves swimming/frolicking together. Thank you!

We had a small group of
L's
in
Boundary Pass
at around

16:00
. As you can see the whales allowed some amazing photo ops!

Arlene Solomon reported
~9 orcas
off Mayne Island, BC, heading east into
Active Pass
at

1:30 pm
. The whales approached from the south. They also heard what sounded like the orcas blowing and splashing the night before (7/23).
*
The
T185's
were found
mid afternoon
west bound near the ODAS buoy south of
Discovery Island BC
. They were last seen south-east bound on a line for Admiralty Inlet.
