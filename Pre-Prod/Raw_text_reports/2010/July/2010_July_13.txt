Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales and SoundWatch was with
J's and L's
from
10 am to about 5 pm
, from Salmon Bank to False Bay, San Juan island.
*
Reaching the middle of July, summer in the
San Juans
is really in full swing. Today we spotted members of the
J and L-pods
near Eagle Point on
San Juan Island
. As we neared their location we could hear the impressively loud blows of the orcas' exhale. Large clouds of mist shot above the surface. Captain Craig lowered our hydrophone into the water, allowing us to hear them communicate below the surface. Each of the pods speak their own dialect. On average, each of the pods have ten separate types of calls.
