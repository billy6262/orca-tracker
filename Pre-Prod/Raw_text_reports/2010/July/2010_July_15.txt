1pm:
Lots of action from the
orcas
as they headed around the south end of
Lopez
. There were breaches, tail slaps, rolls and an interesting charge into a rocky point (must have been some good salmon).

orcas
) I got. They were taken at latitude 48° 27' 24.82"N and longitude 122° 46'9.19"W (S.
Rosario Strait

Veronica von Allworden of Sky and Sea Photography, and Orca Network volunteer, called to report she had done a fly-over of the Everett area and found the
Gray whale
near
Everett
. She then sent us this report: I finally found the gray whale again at about
5 PM
today. It was in a shallow area west of the Large Marine marker that is on the edge of the drop off west of Everett and north of
Hat (Gedney) Island
. The whale was lying on the bottom just coming up to breathe. It did not feed or swim in the 15 minutes that I photographed it. The whale had some pink patches on its back above the flippers. Looked like sea lice, possibly on wounds. It's difficult to say if this was the same whale that I photographed last month. Today's whale spent very little time on the surface and it's hard to get accurate pictures through the water. Today's whale seemed to have more white on its fluke and pink patches on it's back compared to the gray that I photographed on 6/23/10 (we agree - after looking at Veronica's photos of the Gray whale she photographed in June, the flukes on this one definitely look different - ON). There were quite a few boats in the vacinity- none of which seemed to be aware that the whale was there.

We just saw on KIRO News a video they took at around
2 pm
this afternoon of the
Gray whale
swimming toward a small boat setting out a large fishing net - they were on a collision course, when suddenly the boat saw the whale and revved up, taking in the net to avoid the whale, while at the same time the whale made a 90 degree turn to avoid the boat and net - whew!!! The good news is that in this video the whale appeared to be swimming quite well, and wasn't stationary, as in the above report - ON
