Orca Sightings for July 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was pleasantly surprised to see a
Gray Whale
between Roberts Creek and Davis Bay on the
Sunshine Coast of BC
. I watched it moving north. It appeared active and healthy, taking several long dives and resting momentarily at the surface after each one.
Becky Spiker Update on the for search for Everett Gray whale that had stranded earlier this month: I just wanted to let you know that I was out flying, Saturday (24th) in the evening about
6:30 PM, Sunday about 5 PM and Monday at
6:30 and at none of these times have I seen the gray whale that's been near Everett. Maybe it's headed off??

I believe I saw an
orca
whale following a female
gray whale
and her baby off the coast at
Point Arena, California
this weekend. We were watching a female gray and her baby feeding right off the coastline-they were heading north. I was looking thru my binoculars and was able to see the distinct black straight dorsal fin as it swam around the gray in a playful? manner.

Early Sunday
evening
, aboard the Island Explorer 3 we encountered part of
L-Pod
making their way to
Kellett Bluff
. We saw Crewser, Bellena, Alexis, Racer, Nigel, Mystery, Skana, Solstice, Baba, Spirit, Fluke and possibly Ocean Sun. The water was calm, the sun was warm and with the Bluff in the background it was quite a sight to see.

This
morning
aboard the Western Prince around

11:30 AM
we met up with some very spread out
L-Pod
whales off of
Eagle Point
. We spent some time with the L47s and also saw L95 as they slowly made their way north. For our
afternoon
trip we headed north and met up with
J-Pod
as they were passing Turn Point and crossing
Boundary Pass
around
3:30 PM. We followed them towards the Pender Islands where the continued to make their way north along the shoreline. I saw for sure
J1, J2, J8, J19, J41, and the J14
family group. When I got home and looked at my photos I was surprised to see some L-Pod whales in there as well - definitely L12, L22, and L79 and likely some others. One other sighting of note was a pair of
Dall's porpoise
in Boundary Pass while J-Pod was crossing. Like last year, they have been a rare sight during the summer months!

After watching mixed groups of
J's and L's
pass by the
Center for Whale Research
, both vessels departed Snug Harbor at
2:30 pm. The whales were split in two loose groups. Shachi caught up with the first group just off Kellett Bluff (48° 59.867 N; 123° 22.281 W) at

2:39 pm
and Orca went north to
Turn Point
to reach the leading group. The encounter ended in Boundary Pass (48° 73.00 N; 123° 23.233 W) at

3:57 p.m
. with the leading group heading toward
Swanson Channel
.

whale about a mile off of
South Beach
around

Arlene Solomon of Mayne Island, B.C. called to report that
4 orcas
went by & headed into
Active Pass
at

6:15 pm
, including 1 large male - lots of fishing, leaping & breaching - she called back at
6:25 pm & said
9 more orcas
were heading through Active Pass.
*

7:30 am
- Large number of
orcas
just cruised past the south end of
Lopez
, probably about 20 with footprints of whales all over the area. Orcas were traveling slowly, going to the west, in small groups of 1 to 3. Sunshine, blue calm water, Olympics in the distance, some breaches, no boats in sight.

Four orcas (possibly 5) were sighted in Discovery Passage near Whiskey Point on Quadra Island, BC at
6:30 PST today. Whiskey Point is across from
Campbell River
. They were heading South toward to the southern tip of Quadra Island at Cape Mudge and the start of the Strait or Georgia. They were with the flood tide. There did not appear to be a predominant dorsal fin seen amongst the small group. A commercial inflatable whale watching boat was very close to the group and will hopefully provide you with more detail. Approximate coordinates are: N 50° 02.09'; W 125° 12.93'.
