Orca Sightings for July 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
grey whale
has gone past our house (
Roberts Creek BC area
) heading east both yesterday and the day before (
July 20 and 21), both times late in the
afternoon
. This one has a piece missing from the corner of its tail so it is easy to identify. I also saw it at Davis Bay in the early morning of
July 20. As it went by our house, it appeared to be digging into the sandy bottom with its nose as a large amount of sand would come up each time it surfaced. Sounds like it's feeding - ON At the same time yesterday, there was a single spotted sandpiper on the beach.

We saw
3 orcas
in Bowman's Bay,
Whidbey Island
(northwest side of Deception Pass) traveling south, playing - about
7pm
. They were not close enough to see if they were male or female. Not sure I would know if I saw anyways.

We approached
J-pod
traveling South near Pender Bluffs on
So. Pender Island
. Immediately I identified "Ruffles" with his infamously tall and wavy dorsal fin. We counted at least twelve orcas! They traveled in a close knit group, synchronizing their breathes. Watching them breathe in unison is meditative.

Lots of fog this am, and an amazing amount of jumping. No fog this afternoon and evening, but not much jumping. That's the way it goes. Some
Js
went north.

J's, L7 and L53
were with the
L5's and the L26's
in the morning north of
Limekiln
headed north. The L5's and the 26's turned south in Andrew's Bay and the rest continued north out Swanson Channel. A small group of J's apparently came in Boundary Pass mid afternoon and headed south down Haro.
