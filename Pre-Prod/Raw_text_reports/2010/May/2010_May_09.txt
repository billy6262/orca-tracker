Orca Sightings for May 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 Transients
were found in
Haro Strait
heading southerly along
Mandarte Island
. It was 2 females, one of which is a fairly regular visitor-
T124C
. The other was a bit of a surprise in that it was
CA58
, or a California Transient. As we came on scene, it appeared they had just made a kill as they were circling the same area for awhile with lots of direction changes.

Cheryl Hetrick called to let us know that at

5:30 p.m
. she and her husband were at the S. Jetty of
Florence OR
and got to see 3 cows and 3 calves (
orca
) come into the jetty for about an hour. She said it was at the crabbing dock and they played for about an hour, the mothers circling while the calves played. They were close enough to see their eyes and she was awestruck.

We were on the
Seattle/Bainbridge Island
ferry and were approaching Bainbridge Island at around

1:00
when we spotted two
harbor porpoise
. They were in the path of the ferry surfacing frequently and moving quickly to the south.

During our stay with
T124C and CA058
, Val and I witnessed two seal kills from
1630 hrs. to 1730 hrs
. At the time of the seal kills, we were 1.2 nm West of
Zero Rock
.

Beam Reach was with
orcas
(presumably the
two Transients
in the report above), from
3:33 pm, between
N. San Juan Island
and D'Arcy Island, heading east, and off the Saanich Peninsula, Vancouver Island,
at
5:10 pm
.
*
The Center for Whale Research boat was with
orcas
(presumably the two Transients in the report above), between
N. San Juan Island
and D'Arcy Island from

3:12 -
3:30 pm
.

We saw this mother/calf
pair of gray whales
on Mother's Day at Patrick's Point in
Humboldt County, California
. The calf had a very light colored tail, so maybe you can recognize it as it moves up the coast. The calf also had some marks on the face that made us think of orca teeth marks? (could also possibly be from rubbing on Mom's barnacles? sb). We also saw another pair of grays that were closer in size, but the smaller of the two was a very pale color.

Our Stranding Network received several calls about
a Gray whale
in
Oak Harbor
"beaching itself", but it was the Gray whale that has been regularly feeding in the area just feeding in shallow water. One call came in at

7:30 pm
from Neal Ketchum of the Oak Harbor Marina. The dispatcher had called him to report a call of a gray whale beaching itself near buoy #8. At
7:10 pm we received a call from a man who had been in the sail boat regatta today. He reported a beached gray whale near Buoy #8 which may be near the east end of the harbor.

We just returned from a day sail in Saratoga Passage. As we were motoring out of
Oak Harbor Marina
, we saw
a lone gray whale
feeding in the shallows on the East side of the channel, between the shore and the red channel markers. The tide was still low, and it was moving very slowly. We turned off the engine and drifted on the other side of the channel to watch for a bit. There were a number of boats coming in from the Round Whidbey race, and some coming out from the marina to watch, and all were very respectful and gave the whale distance - it helped too, that the whale was inside the channel markers. We originally saw the whale about
11am
though it looked as though it had been there for awhile. We watched for about 30 minutes, and when we continued out the channel, the whale continued traveling in toward the R"8" marker. We could still see it near the innermost marker after a good 60 minutes or so after we left the channel. When we came back in after sailing at about
4pm
, we saw a couple of blows of presumably the same whale at about the number 4 marker. It seemed to be traveling out of the channel.

Billy Wind of Oak Harbor called to report
a Gray whale
in
Oak Harbor
, at the R4 buoy at

12:22 PM
, close to the beach on the east side of the Harbor during the Round Whidbey sailboat race.

Very large
gray whale
@
11 AM
leaving
Penn Cove
on the north side shores. What a great mothers day. I was hoping to see one.

Isabelle Cameros called to report a large
gray whale
in
Penn Cove
from

9:30 - 10 am
, it was first heading out of the Cove from Coupeville toward Lovejoy Pt, then it turned around and headed back in toward Coupeville.
*
I was on the Washington State Ferry going from
Keystone to Port Townsend
. Suddenly the back of a medium sized whale appeared in their midst, scattering the birds and the whale exhaled with a low diffuse spout. Given the behavior, size, shape and color I am confident that the whale was a
minke
.

We deployed several satellite tags on
fin whales
which indicated the whales were spending their time in deep water between the Astoria Canyon and Grays Canyon- roughly
40 miles from shore
. We headed southwest from Grays Harbor and encountered more fin whales in this area, and also several
humpbacks
in the southernmost reaches of our survey. We deployed an additional satellite tag and collected several biopsy samples which will be used for genetic analyses of stock structure. In total we collected 20 or more photo-ID's for comparison to our fin whale catalog, and to our great surprise encountered a fin whale we know from several years of research in Southern California, which was exciting as it is our first documented cross-regional match. All in all, a very productive two days toward a better understanding of this population.
