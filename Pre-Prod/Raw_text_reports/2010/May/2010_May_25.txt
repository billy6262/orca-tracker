Orca Sightings for May 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Out with Capt. Jim on a
morning
trip. We were going to look for some of the transients that had been in the area and instead we came upon many members of L Pod!!! When
Crewser L-92, Fluke L-105 and Pooka L-106
surfaced one after another we were about in shock and then took several minutes to get some pics and get some IDs. I could tell there were whales from several different
L Pod
subgroups and we could see they were spread way out. The only large male we saw was L-92 and he is still a teenager. There were tails slaps, a baby breaching, an older whale breaching off in the distance and even a spyhop.

The Residents are back !!!! Finally, some of
L-pod
returned to local waters today.... The morning trip was spent off of
Eagle Pt.
with some of the
L-26's
. On the way back to the harbour, Mallard and I bumped into
T-20 and T-21
, 2.5 nm NE of Seabird Pt. (
Discovery Island
). The afternoon trip turned out even better as we had the first triple header of the year !!!! Residents, Transients and a juvenile
Humpback
, 1 nm SW of VH Buoy. The animal was moving quickly to the Southwest towards Race Rocks and was not showing any tail.

Jeff Hogan called at
8PM
to say he finally got a good look at the
orcas
off
West Seattle
, and they were
10-12 transients
, including three adult males. One male had two notches off the top of its dorsal fin and another notch about a fifth of the way down the trailing edge.
*
This evening I was at
Seahurst Park
(near Burien) and I believe that I spotted
several Orca Whales
. Around

7:00pm
I was walking the beach when I noticed large black things floating in the water. The distance from the shore was around 2 football fields so I can not be sure of what I saw.

5 orcas
circling
Blakely Island

.
*
Jeff Hogan saw
at least ten orcas
across Puget Sound near
Ft. Ward, Bainbridge Island
, at

4:24pm
, still heading south. He later reported seeing three adult males among 10-12 whales.

Donna Sandstrom reported
orcas
near the
Bainbridge ferry lane at 4pm
.
*

10:21 AM
- A caller reported hearing VHF radio chatter saying the
Kingston-Edmonds ferry
had stopped for a group of
orcas
.
*
The Center for Whale Research relayed a report of
three transient orcas
off
Otter Bay, Pender Island BC
, at

9:30am
.
*

9:18 AM
: Just received a call from a friend on a sailboat. He reports what he believes are J pod off Pt. No Pt., middle of the sound heading South. He ID'd Ruffles so I'm guessing he's correct.
This was probably a group of transient orcas. -hg

Watching the water from my living room I noticed
two porpoise
dorsal fins in the waters just off
Richmond Beach
. I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look. The dorsal fins were almost head-on towards me, but their coloration and shape looked more like Dall's Porpoise than Harbor Porpoise. There were definitely two of them. I saw each of their dorsal fins surface twice, nearly in tandem with one another.
