Orca Sightings for May 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After sailing up the West Coast last week in the Oregon Offshore Race and seeing Humpbacks, Gray Whales, Brown Pelicans and Tufted Puffins it was a nice change to see some Killer Whales in Georgia Strait. Vanessa and I had a brilliant encounter with the T-100's and the T-101's off of East Point Light. The whales were traveling Southeast towards Patos Island and were swimming through the huge tidal rips off of boiling Reef. All around the whales were lots of Seals, Sea Lions and Harbour Porpoise also feeding in the same area.

I was riding the Kingston/Edmonds ferry from Edmonds at

7:30pm
when a woman who was sitting on the L side of the boat told me as we were walking off that she thought she'd seen a large
grey whale
just under the water, nearer the Edmonds side. She said she also thought she saw some porpoise fins. She said she'd clearly seen the tail shape of the large grey mass just under the water (no spouts or nothing surfaced). I didn't see anything myself.

We had a wonderful sighting of what appeared to be
6 to 8 Orca whales
traveling southeast along the north side of
Patos
and then
Sucia
(San Juan Islands). The sighting occurred at approx.

4:50 pm
. There was one large male of particular note. They seemed to be swimming in 2 to 3 groups along the outer edges of the tidal currents.

At approximately
noon
, we got the radio call that one of our boats had spotted a single
orca
in
Georgia Strait
, near the midpoint of
Galiano Island
. As we headed in that direction, the report grew to
4 whales
. When we were still 5 miles away, we were distracted by a huge splash, then fins. We had found our own group of
T's
northeast of
Active Pass
, and they were busily hunting an unfortunate young sea lion. We stopped some distance away to watch these top predators take turns at subduing their prey. A few minutes later, a limp brown body was floating at the surface. The 5 T's -
T87, T88, T124, T124D & T124E
- stayed under for several minutes at a time, followed by excited surfacings. Soon the first seagull arrived for scraps, followed by his friends. During the encounter, it was noted that T87 has some fresh wounds at the tip of his dorsal fin, on both sides, which appear to be rake marks. Our 5 T's remained in the same area, milling and eating, and vocalizing! Meanwhile, the other group of T's were now up to 9 individuals - T14, T100's (including T100E, but not T100D), T101's, and T102 - and had moved to within a mile of our location. We could see that group porpoising towards us. When the two groups met, it was a casual meeting compared to the precision lineup of resident orcas. We did observe 3 head-head meetings in which one whale would always back away, and then angle head-up before slipping below the surface. T14 was not present during the meet & greet. We last saw the whales headed in a southwesterly direction towards Mayne Island, a long line of blows and fins.

Orca Network received a call from Tom Paulu of the Longview Daily News, relaying a report he'd had from a man who saw
2 orcas
in the
Columbia River
near Longview at 2 PM. Howard talked to the man, Scott White, who saw the orcas from hwy 4/Ocean Beach Hwy while sitting on the guard rail waiting for construction on the road. The whales were 30' away, and he saw one adult and one smaller orca, approx. 8 - 10 miles downstream from Longview, WA, near Stella and Germany Creek. Brent Norberg of NOAA Fisheries wrote "According to the Coast Pilot Stella is at river mile 48.9" - wow! that's nearly 50 miles upriver!!

Watched the
T100's and T101's (Transient orcas)
swim past dozens of harbor porpoise and steller sealions feeding in the current between
East Point Lighthouse
and
Patos Island
light between
1620 and 1700hrs
. They were last seen heading east along the north side of Patos Island.

Jim Maya and Jeanne Hyde called at

2:50 pm
- they had
10 - 15 Transients
4 miles SE of
Active Pass
heading toward East Pt. in Georgia Strait, heading toward a bunch of Steller sea lions. They called again at

4:15 pm
to report they were with Transient orcas
T100B & C, T101, T101A&B and T102
, 3 miles off Patos Light heading toward Patos Island.

Today I was out with Capt. Jim of Maya's Westside Charters and having learned of transients near Active Pass we went to locate them. When we found them at about

2:30 pm
they were east of
Active Pass
, a few miles from shore, heading east toward East Point. There were two groups - the
T100s and the T101s
and T102 was with the T101s. However there was one whale who was missing from the T100 group - a 4 year old who has been missing since last year. After observing this group for a while, who were in a slow but steady travel mode it was clear that T100D, a 4 year old was NOT present. Present in that group were T100, T100B, T100C and the baby T100E. Traveling in a parallel fashion yet a more than a 1/2 mile from this group were the T101s, consisting of T101, T101A and T101B, and with them was T102. No other whales were observed in the area, in flat calm water, during the time we were there. I will be posting pics on my blog in a while (and see photo of the day, above).

Sitting here at Lincoln Park, spotted at least four
porpoise
(probably harbor) mid channel just south of the Fauntleroy/Vashon run, milling around and circling. Also , Harbor seal very active just off shore from us. Such a peaceful calm on the water.
