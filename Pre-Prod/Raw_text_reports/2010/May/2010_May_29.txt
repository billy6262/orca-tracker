I was out at
Lime Kiln
yesterday around

5:00pm
, despite the less than wonderful weather--I've been trying to get out there every weekend because I've been dying to spot the whales and only have a little longer to live on the island. We had only been there for 20 minutes when I saw a group of
4-5 orcas
surface fairly close to shore. There were two larger ones and two or three smaller ones and they surfaced a few times in front of us. We kept watching and saw them again off in the distance--they appeared to be heading toward Victoria.
