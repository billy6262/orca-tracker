Orca Sightings for May 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
0430
: We observed
6-7 Orcas
off of the east side of
Blake Island, Puget Sound
this
morning
. They were heading North but were very active with many tail slaps and spy hopping.

On our way back to Vancouver we also ran into a group of
6 Transients
just north of the
belle chain islands
in the
strait of georgia
.

On a search for more orcas I went back through the pass and headed to the Belle Chain in Georgia Strait. At
1430
, after seeing the hundreds of sea lions, those southerly fins that I probably saw earlier were heading north. Were these more residents? It was looking possible with the close group of 6 or 7 and others seen off in the distance. As time passed the 1 or 2 off in the distance joined the small group for some socializing. At
1330
some of these
Transients
went along the shoreline north of
Active Pass
while the others moved parallel further off shore.

Finally, a sighting of resident killer whales for those of us in the northern portion of their range. Some of
L pod
were located at approximately
noon
today, just entering
Active Pass
from the east side, at Georgina Point. Although the usual direction of travel for them is west to east, this was a little deja vu of the return of L pod last spring. The group stayed close to the Mayne Island shoreline, and entered Miner's Bay. They then did an abrupt change of path, putting them in the centre of the pass, in the tide rips (tide was on a flood at the time), and in the pathway of an oncoming ferry. The ferry had slowed for the whales, and once it passed, there was no sight of them, until we looked behind us. They had circled back into Miner's Bay to take another try at the pass. Numerous spyhops ensued, always by the same whale with some distinctive lines along the mouth. For the remainder of Active Pass, the group stayed very close to the Mayne Island shore. Their blows were remarkable against the dark background, however, ID's were difficult with shaded saddle patches. As the whales approached the end of the pass they became more active with some upside down swimming, tail slaps, pec slaps, half breaches (see photo), kelping and finally porpoising their way into
Swanson Channel
. Where they had been quite close together through Active Pass, they split off into several small groups in Swanson. Some groups porpoised quickly into the distance, some traveled leisurely against the current, and others kept up the breaching contest! The whales we could definitely ID were the
L12's
, including
L25, the L5's and L22's
. There may have been more.

Awesome day today with
L pod
just south of
active pass
. Lots of breaching and spyhops and we even got to see Lolita's mom
L25
.
Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

At approximately
1200
I saw some fins on the west side of
Active Pass
. It looked as if some fins were also south of the pass but more about that later. At approximately 1230 I entered the pass where some whale watch companies were with the orcas in Miner's Bay. There were about
20 L pod orcas
moving in tight groups through along the southerly shore when a ferry approached. The orcas grouped up and were back in Miner's Bay. As they moved again to exit the pass numerous eagles were soaring above. After some head views, pec slaps, and porpoising they left the pass at
1310
. Once in Swanson Channel they picked up speed and spread out.

Just spent the
afternoon
hanging out with a few members of
L-Pod
up near
Vancouver Island
.

Val Veirs recorded many calls from members of
L pod
.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries said they were able to get out and collect some fish scale samples from
L pod
foraging events off the west side of
San Juan Island
, between Hannah Heights and False Bay, as the whales headed south.
*
I was fortunate enough today to be out at
Lime Kiln
(W. San Juan Island) to see
L-pod's
homecoming. I saw Ocean Sun, Flash (who looks more & more like his Daddy ..lol) as well as Calypso and her calf L113. It was approx

5:30 or 6 pm
when we could see them coming from the north -- VERY spread out & only a few came close to shore. Looked like they were headed towards Victoria.

We began hearing
Southern Resident orca calls
on the Orca Sound hydrophone (NW San Juan Island) at

4:45 pm
. At about

6:25 pm
we began to hear calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
as
L pod
continued south - heard calls until at least

7:30 pm
.
The Center for Whale Research was with members of
L pod
- the
L9, L12, and L54
sub-pods, off Stuart Island at

3:42 pm
, following them south. At

4:40 pm
they were off
Henry Island
, at

5:30 off NW San Juan Island
. We were able to see some of the orcas on the Center's Orca Cam, while listening to them on the Beam Reach/Whale Museum OrcaSound hydrophones! Thanks to all of the above for providing these amazing technologies for those of us not lucky enough to see or hear the whales first-hand!

We had reports of
Southern Resident orcas
off
Nanaimo
early this morning, and in
Active Pass
around

12:15 pm
.
*
Just when we think they've left the area - we received a call from Ted Weber at

7:55 pm
, reporting a lone orca, off
Lagoon Pt
, Whidbey Island, mid-channel in Admiralty Inlet heading north!
*
At about

7:50 PM
, from
Lagoon Pt
., we saw at least
one orca
(male) headed north toward Fort Casey.

11:00 am
- Near Norwegian Point Park, (
Hansville
, Kitsap County). Spotted large white water disturbance in the waters across the sound, off
Double Bluff
, Whidbey Island. It turned out to be at least 4-5 very, very active
orcas
! Perhaps socializing? It sure looked like play to me. They stayed in one area for some time and close to the surface diving and leaping from the water sometimes a couple in unison. With binoculars it appears that one had to be a male from the size and one appeared to be a juvenile. They then moved quickly across the shipping lanes, (no ships in sight) some porpoising, some underwater, still quite far from the western shore and headed north. What a joy to see such a show of life!

Orca
whales - appeared to be at least
5 animals
, off
Bainbridge Island
, just outside of Eagle Harbor traveling North ~

6:30 am
. They appeared to just be slowly traveling north ward, very relaxed pace. There was at least 1 male. We were not close enough to see any further detail. (seen from the Bainbridge to Seattle ferry.)

A number of
orcas
were just East of Wing Point, on
Bainbridge Island
, as seen from the
0620
ferry as it left Eagle Harbor. There were only two on the surface at any one time, but it appeared that there were at least
3-4
total. They were about 150 yards offshore. At least one had a fairly prominent dorsal. Not sure if they were feeding or not, but they were moving very slowly to the North at first, and then were headed to the West, toward Bainbridge.

9:50 am
- Had the binocs out for something else, when I noticed suspicious "calm spots" in the water. The tide was already out quite a ways, and
a lone Gray
was feeding off the drop-off a mile south of
Mabana
(SW Camano Isl), and heading south. Barbara Brock, Camano Island
*
Orca Network received a call from Tony Woelke of the WA State Ferry Puyallup, reporting
1 Gray whale
1 mile north of
Pt. Wells, near Edmonds
, heading north at

9:37 am
.
*
This morning (
NW of Langley
) we were woken up at

5:50 AM
by whale blows and looking out we watched
a gray whale
swimming by from SE to NW. He was not feeding, just swimming along the drop off. I grabbed my camera took a couple of shots and it was Patch, #49!!
