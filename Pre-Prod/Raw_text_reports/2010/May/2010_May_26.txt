I am reporting having observed a group
Killer Whales
at approximately

7:30PM
. They were observed at Staleshin, Wilson Creek on the
Sunshine Coast, British Colombia
. They were observed very close to shore, up to a couple of hundred and predominantly 1000-2000 feet. At first all I saw was one seal suddenly rise as if standing in the water to scan the horizon. This happened repeatedly and then I observed that seal & others doing the same while making haste towards shore where they remained for perhaps an hour and a half more after the whales departed southward and appeared to travel close to shore. At first all I saw was water stirring and then several shapes came up out of the water and at first I thought it was dolphins or porpoises and then I saw how big they all were as fins, dorsal fins and tails emerged in a seathing, circular repeated patern as well as expanding and contracting the diameter of the circle. The seals remained on high alert. The reason I think they may have caught a seal as opposed to fish is how paranoid the seals were long after the killer whales left, and I know nothing about fish or if any are migrating in this area now. There definitely were two very young animals in the group given the size difference. What really stood out was that none had a dorsal fin of any substantial size or difference in size. The dorsal fins all seemed similar in size and shape. I know there is a difference between male/female whales dorsal fins so I really tried to see the male as I thought he would stand out and I couldn't be sure because the dorsal fins were not exaggerated in any way. It was hard to count accurately the number but I think it was 6-8/9. That would include the young ones.

I saw
two orcas
while on the

7:35 AM
ferry to
Bremerton
! I've lived in this area for 30 years, even grew up on a sailboat, and never have I seen orcas before! They were just north of Blake Island heading west. The very large dorsal fin caught my eye. The other wasn't quite as large.
