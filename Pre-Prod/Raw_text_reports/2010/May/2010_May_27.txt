Orca Sightings for May 27, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Late afternoon
on Maya's Westside Charters, we met up with
J pod
north of
Alden Bank
, Whatcom county WA, heading north. They were spread out in groups of various sizes. J17 and her two daughters seemed to be in charge of most all of the kids -J36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 46 and 47. J41 and J42 were traveling with J42's mom Slick J16 and her oldest offspring Mike J26. Ruffles J1, Granny J2, Canuck L7, Spieden J8 and Keet J33 were all way ahead of the rest of the whales. Others were in small groups or surfacing individually, some very far off from the rest.

We have seen our first
Grey whale
of this year. The Whale was 8 miles west of
Sekiu, WA
heading west towards Neah Bay. First spotted directly off of Chito Beach Resort and disappeared around Ship Wreck Point about 10 minutes later. We usually have whale sightings on this part of the Strait of Juan De Fuca around the 15th of April.

They're back!! It was great to see
J pod
today, vocalizing and lots of foraging going on which is always a nice sight to see. They were
spread very far apart
in the strait of georgia, east of
Point Roberts
. We spent time with
J16, J22, J26, J34 and J38
among others.

Jim Maya and Jeanne Hyde tell us
J1 (Ruffles), J2 (Granny), and J8 (Speiden)
, are all present and accounted for north of Orcas Island this evening.

We found some members of
J pod
, and one
L pod
whale today just south of
Point Roberts in the Strait of Georgia
. The whales were very spread out, traveling in matrilines, or as individuals. They were doing long dives, likely foraging. We were fortunate to observe one feeding event, when J16's (Slick's) family shared in the catch of a silver fish, likely a Chinook salmon. J33 (Keet) did not show up for dinner with the rest of the family - hopefully just a case of teenage independence. We also observed Rhapsody, J32, traveling with her relatives, the J22's (Oreo's matriline). J14 (Samish) and her brood were also identified. J1 (Ruffles) was way off to the south, ahead of the rest of the group, and the lone representative of L pod that we saw, L7 (Canuck), was traveling near him. Overall, it was a very peaceful encounter, on calm waters, with J Pod calls once again on the hydrophone.

It was a bit of a rocky day out there with 2 foot swells, but it was still a great day! The Southern Resident
L- pod
was first spotted off
False Bay
on the southwest side of the island. The pod was spread out into several smaller groups. We chose to take a look at a smaller group that seemed to be frolicking in the waves. Eventually they moved offshore to slightly calmer waters and milled about. We continued along the west side of the island encountering a small pod of
Dall's porpoise
. These small black and white porpoises are often very social riding the bow wake of boats.

I live in Olalla about 3/10's of a mile from Al's. We just saw two beautiful
orcas
swim by on their way toward
Prospect Point
at
5 p.m.
Prospect Point is off of Shoreline Drive SE. The first outcropping of low-banks homes as you head up Banner Road. They were gently cruising and wonderfully incredible. Both whales appeared to be smaller. They were swimming north right next to my house on the Olalla side of
Colvos Passage
, across from Vashon.

We saw
Orcas, 6-8
traveling North, West side of
Colvos Passage
, 1/2 mile North of Fragaria about 200 yards off shoreline. One large male with the top of his dorsal shaped with an "m" or "v "shaped grove in top of fin. the fin was about 4 or 5 feethigh. Looked like a slight, light gray area on his back at the base of his fin. There were two females and one with young baby by her side. These females looked like they had the same light gray area. We don't know if it was the reflection of the sky off the wet skin. There were
3 or 4 more orcas

I was working on the south tip of
Bainbridge Island
, on South Beach Drive, when a pod of
Orcas
swam by, about
11AM
or so. There were maybe
4-5 adults, one with a very large dorsal fin and maybe 3-4 young ones
. They were swimming east. Attached are 4 pictures that I took. The homeowner also took pictures and might have better ones if you want copies. Both he and his wife said it was the first time they've ever seen Orcas swimming by.

abt
0715
- Just saw a single tall dorsal fin followed by a blow and submergence - right off
Keyport
headed South in the channel out of
Liberty Bay
. I've seen lots of whales over the years and there's no doubt this was an Orca. No other dorsal like it!

Where: Sinclair Inlet entering
Rich Passage
N47.585 W122.580
Direction traveling: ENE
What were they doing? Transiting. Male had two notches. One on the top of his fin (it looked like two tips), and one on the trailing edge about 1/5th the way down from the tip. I could confirm the ID with a photo.

A
gray whale
was reported by Mary Jo Stansberry in
Greenbank
today. It fed there for about two hours (

12:30 -
2:30
), back and forth along a quarter mile line about 200 yards off the beach at Wonn Road, rolling on its side in typical feeding behavior every couple of minutes. Not known is whether there was much shrimp or other good food for it there. After
2:30 it moved on northward parallel to the beach. At

3:45
Mary Pacher reported the whale off the north end of North Bluff Rd., still heading north at a good clip about 500 yards from the beach. At

8:00pm
Mary Jo reported it back at the same beach, near Wonn Rd., so maybe there was something good there.

Harbor porpoises
went by, unable to count a/c trees in my view. I used to see Dall's but haven't in a long time. We live a little north of Salty's in Redondo,
Des Moines
, Wash.
