Orca Sightings for May 24, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We get a call that a small group of
Transients
were discovered near Anacortes in
Rosario Channel
heading towards Cypress. So off we went, and after watching a few seals and eagles, we found ourselves watching Transient groups
T2s and T123s
. They were in no hurry to go anywhere, and would spend quite a bit of time at the surface before going on a long dive. They continued northerly and there was an air of expectation as they neared the
Peapods
(a small chain of islands that are a known seal haul-out), but the transients were content to work the tide rips and continued north. We left them heading towards Lawrence Point, and we were all excited at seeing these marine predators. But our day would prove far from over as we get a call that more transients have been discovered just a short distance in front of us. And my favorite transient was in this group.
T40
is known as
Captain Hook
for his very prominent hooked dorsal fin (the top foot makes a 180 curve to the left). T40 was traveling with 2 other transients and they actually followed us through Peavine Pass. And while they appeared to be actively hunting for something to munch on, we did not witness any kills. But it was such a treat to see this massive guy traveling along the shorelines, especially as he passed 3 immature bald eagles feasting on something along the shoreline!

We got a report of
transient orcas
in
Rosario Strait
at about
noon
, when we were at the opposite end of our range. By the time we arrived on scene, they were traveling northeast along
Cypress Island
, in typical transient fashion - 5 minutes underwater followed by a breathing sequence of approximately 5 breaths. The group then turned northwest towards
Orcas Island
, eventually passing Lawrence Point. While alongside the dark shoreline, their blows were beautifully displayed. All this time they were swimming with the flood tide. A
minke whale
passed by heading southeast, against the tidal current, within approx 20 yards of the group. The minke only surfaced once while near the orcas, and was not seen again. The T's interrupted their travel momentarily, split into two groups, then continued in a northeast direction towards the Sisters Islands in the southern Strait of Georgia. No kills or chases occurred during our encounter. The group of six T's were comprised of
T2C, T2C1, T2C2
(the little whale with the wavy fin), and tentatively
T123, T123A and a calf
(not in my ID book) that appeared to be about 1 year old.

I heard from Makah that there were
5 [orcas]
including at least one calf off
Neah Bay
last night, seen heading west this
morning
.

We finished off the long weekend here by checking out some
transient orca
off of
Orcas Island
. We had a group of 6, one of which was
T002C
but had a hard time identifying the others especially because one was a sprouting male. They were milling around for a while with a lot of playing and then headed north.

Three sets of Orcas
today. We chose a group heading north along the east side of
Orcas Island
, the
T100s
, and saw some amazing blows with a dark Orcas Island in the background. Then, over near
Sucia Island
, they make a kill.

Out with Capt. Jim of Maya's Charters. We met up with the
T2Cs
and the
T123s
in
Rosario St
. on the east side of
Orcas Island
just north of Barnes Island as they headed north at about
3 pm
. (These same whales were in Haro Strait on Sunday traveling with T20 and T21, however on Monday T20 and T21 were not present.) They seemed to stop and take a harbor seal from time to time and then as they neared Sucia Island some of the whales began lunging, perhaps going after a porpoise which they quickly made a meal of. I posted pics on my blog of the encounter.
