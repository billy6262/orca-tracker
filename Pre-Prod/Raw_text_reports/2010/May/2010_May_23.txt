Orca Sightings for May 23, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nancy called from Salt Spring Island with a belated report of
Orcas
in
Trinconeli Channel
. There were at least 4 orcas, heading slowly south between Salt Spring and Galiano Islands, by Wallace Island near Fernwood. The pod included 2 males, 1 with a very big fin.
*
I went out with Maya's Westside Charters where, at about
5pm
, we met up with several
transients
who were near
Discovery Island
and were beginning to travel up
Haro Strait
.
T020 and T021
were a couple miles to the southeast of the main group. The main group consisted of
T002C, T002C1, T002C2, T123, T123A, calf T123B
. T020 changed his location and moved over and traveled with the main group. T021 was still far off to the east. At about

7:45pm
while on the Center for Whale Research (CWR) boat with Ken Balcomb, apx. a mile south of Kelp Reef Marker, we watched as T021 moved across Haro Strait to meet up with the main group as they continued to travel north.

Around
noon
we observed
a gray whale
heading north along the south-eastern coast of
Camano Island
. The gray was making steady progress northward, not stopping to eat; it was not swimming right along shore. We were observing it from across the water in Tulalip Shores, with the aid of binocs, so couldn't distinguish much except the shape of the back and the blows.

Erick Peirson relayed a report of
Orcas
inbound at
Sheringham, BC
at

8:30 am
. At

10:40 am
, they were at
Church Pt
, still inbound. At
1135 am
he reported
5 Transients
- 2 males, 2 females, and 1 juvenile off Race Rocks heading E toward Constance Bank. At noon, more were reported at 48 19.85N, 123 12.65W, direction of travel unknown. This group was then reported headed N toward Discovery Island at
12:46, then at 1 pm had turned and headed SE.
*
Orca Network received a report of
4 orcas
5 miles west of the
Crescent City, CA
lighthouse - 1 male, 1 female, 1 juvenile & 1 unknown, heading N. at

1:25 pm
.
*
There was much conjecture as to whether there were two calves or one with the mother (
Humpback whale
). The conversation went back and forth all day. When I got to them late in the afternoon they were all coming out of
Bedwell Harbor, Pender Island, BC
, and the whale watch boat on scene said that he had seen both calves surface at the same time. From the pictures that I took, I can only find two whales total, though I thought I saw two calves also.
