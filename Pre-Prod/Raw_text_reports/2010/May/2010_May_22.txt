Orca Sightings for May 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
A whale (not sure what kind?) was heading South towards Boston Harbor around

3:30
in Dana Passage (
S. Puget Sound
). It breached a couple of times before we lost site of it.

I have been watching
a gray whale
feed between Jetty Island and the
Everett Marina
just North of Anthony's restaurant. I first saw it North of the Everett Yacht Club on Friday night, June21, 2010 at about

7:30 PM
. It must be eating shrimp. On Saturday morning at about

8:00 AM
I saw it again near Anthony's. It is definitely feeding and there are many seagulls in the area. I saw its head this morning.

Orca Network and Cascadia Research received several calls about this Gray whale yesterday, and KING5 TV has some video and an article here, the video shows this is another very emaciated whale. There have been no reports of the whale that we know of on Sunday, though we also had reports of a gray whale in the same area a week ago.

9:55am
, I counted at least 6 of what looks like
harbor porpoise
in the center of Commencement Bay, slowly working their way north.

We came out into some pretty rough waters today but it ended up being worth it. We went just south of
Sand Heads Light, north of the Fraser River, BC
, and found
6 transient orca
including
T124 and T87
. They mostly traveled but near the end of our time with them, they chased down and killed something but I could not get a good look at what it was. They celebrated a little after with a couple breaches and tail slaps which was awesome!!
