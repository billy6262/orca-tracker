Orca Sightings for May 10, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had
Transient orcas T020 and T021 with the T002C's
east bound west of
Sooke
at
1030
. At the same time
CA058 and T124C
were spotted off
Victoria
heading west. They met up with T020's group in the afternoon near
Race Rocks
and all continued east for Trial Island. At approximately 1830 CA058 and T124C broke off while the others continued north east for Haro Strait.

As we were heading West on the afternoon tour, Vanessa and I picked up
T-20, T-21 and the T-2's
approximately 1 nm Southwest of Church Rk. (2.5 nm West of
Race Rocks
) at
1345
hrs. The five Transients were grouped together and traveling East towards Race Rocks Lighthouse. During our stay with them we saw one seal kill near Race Passage. At which point, the animals went off -- Lots of spyhops, breaches and tail flips -- Brilliant !! Later in the tour, the group of five Transients met up with two others, T-124C and CA058 near Albert Hd. Once all together, the seven Killer Whales proceeded Northeast towards Victoria. Our encounter finished at
1615
hrs., 2.5 nm East of
Albert Hd
.

Alaska time spotted about
twenty orcas
in the distance spread out and traveling off the east shore of Brownson Island in Ernest Sound north of
Ketchikan
in SE Alaska. Believe because of size it was a resident pod.
