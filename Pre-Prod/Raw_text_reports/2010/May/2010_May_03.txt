Orca Sightings for May 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched a 30-35'
gray whale
feeding on the east side of Tala Point (head of
Hood Canal
, west side) starting about

6:00 PM
. It was feeding in the shallows, in water as shallow as 8 feet, 75' from shore. It fed back and forth along the shoreline for about 1/3 mile. We watched it for about 1.5 hours. It left swimming towards Admiralty Inlet once the wind started to drop.
We have lived here 20 years. Only the 4th sighting in this area. Usually they are cruising by, first evidence of feeding behavior we have seen on the beach in front of our home. Can't wait to go down at low tide to see the changes the whale caused.

3
(one big one and 2 little
orcas
) and possibly a 4th (? - none of us were really sure but we thought so) Orca were in
Port Angeles
harbour.

I saw
ORCA
traveling North in
Sansum Narrows
between

6:15 -
6:30 PM
. It was stormy-rough with the North wind blowing white caps and big waves from the wild wind storm that hit the BC Coast Sunday night and blew all day Monday. Of course, the whales could dive below the rough water. It looked like there were about 5-6. One huge male with a fat dorsal fin at the base and looking like it was chopped off at the top (I was in my boat to the left of the whales). Several females? Maybe a baby? I snapped a few digital with my dinky LUMIX, just for ID, and in one photo I see 4 whales up at once. I imagine these are Transients. Do you have any idea who they are?

(possibly T40 and friends who've been in the area - his fin is hooked over so could look chopped off - see photo above - sb)

Ed Bowlby of the Olympic Coast Natl. Marine Sanctuary called to report
two orcas
(not adult males) inside the breakwater off
Pt. Angeles
, at the western end, 200 meters from the commercial pier, heading north at

10:10 am
.

Had a single large adult
grey
feeding all over Elger Bay (
SW Camano Island
) this morning in both deep and shallow areas. I noticed it about

8:00 AM
, and it moved on about
9:00. Looked to be 30-40 feet in length.
