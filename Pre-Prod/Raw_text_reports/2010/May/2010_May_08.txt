Minke whale
passing thru while shrimping between Clark/Barnes Islands and east side of Orcas, about

I was kayaking with a group of friends from Salsbury Pt. to
Kingston
, and as we approached Apple Cove Pt. just north of Kingston at about

12:30pm
we saw a whale blow just in front of us and only about 10-15 foot from shore. As we paddled past the point we got several good views of him, enough to determine that it was a feeding
gray whale
. A large wake from a container vessel came thru just then and the whale moved east into deeper water and looked like it was moving north toward Pt. No Point.

- they were unsure of the direction of travel.

Rich Shaughnessy of Greenbank called to report a
Minke Whale
at Partridge Bank,
NW Whidbey Island

noon

Today around
noon
while kayaking approximately 1/2 mile west of the
Steilacoom
Ferry Terminal, I encountered
8-10 Porpoises
that appeared to be feeding.

We had two separate encounters with individual
Minke whales
in the straits -- between
Protection Island and Port Townsend
, about one mile off-shore. We were fishing for halibut north of McCurdy Point, the whale seemed to be moving.
