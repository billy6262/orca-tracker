I'm visiting my parents who live near
Belfair
on the South Shore of
Hood Canal
. At about

3:30
we were looking out towards the water and by god a
grey whale
blew! My folks have lived here for nearly 60 years and this is the first I've ever seen on this far end of the Canal. It was obviously feeding and moving slowly. One whale and not large as close as I could tell.

I'm not an expert, but I think this might have been that
Grey Whale
that has been seen around these parts. 1 whale, traveling south at
2:12:26 PM PST, sighted from
Golden Gardens Beach
(near Shilshole). It was going South, blew a short and wide spray that persisted no more than a second, and quickly submerged again. The dorsal fin was short and devoid of markings that I could see. It seemed to appear in the same general area several times over the next fifteen minutes, always traveling south as it surface, but never appearing farther south. As such, I wasn't sure if this was several animals or one. At one point I thought I got a good look at what seemed like a small black dolphin to my untrained eyes. I never saw any large dorsal fins or black/white markings or large numbers that I would expect with Orca.
