Orca Sightings for February 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Chad Kaiser called Orca Network to report a probable
Gray whale
off
Point No Point
, N. Kitsap Peninsula at

10:30 pm
. It was so close to the beach, ~25', he could see it, it was heading north, had no dorsal fin, just bumps on its back (Gray whales have "knuckles" rather than dorsal fins).
*
In the
afternoon
I found the
T060's and T02B
south of
Saltspring Island
heading into Saanich Inlet.
