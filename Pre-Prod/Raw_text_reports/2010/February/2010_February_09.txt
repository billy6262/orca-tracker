Orca Sightings for February 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just spotted a
gray whale
blowing across
Port Susan
from Tulalip Shores. Headed south near Camano Island at

3:15 PM
.
Jim & Vicki Mattson, Tulalip Shores WA
*
We received the two following reports of a whale near Pt. Defiance late in the
afternoon
- guesses as to species are possible orca or gray whale, but given the recent sighting of a Humpback whale in the Seattle area, and the diving/fluking pattern, it is possible these are sightings of the
humpback
whale. -sb

Today while sailing approx 1/2 mile North of
Pt defiance, Tacoma
, we spotted a Gray Whale about 35+ ft long. He seemed to be feeding during the changing tide between
1200 and 1500 hrs
. It seemed to be flying solo with no hurry to go anywhere particular.
