Orca Sightings for February 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nice
Transient calls
on
Pt. Townsend hydrophone
at just before midnight at about

23:45
.
Val Veirs, The Whale Museum/OrcaSound, San Juan Island

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC called with a report tonight. After receiving the call from Orca Network, they were able to get out in the NOAA boat and found the
transient orcas
in two groups in the vicinity of
Point No Point
, N. Kitsap Peninsula this afternoon, observing a sea lion kill. They were successful in deploying satellite tags on T100B & T100C, and will be posting maps of their movements on the Cascadia Research website in the next few days. They left the orcas at around

4:30 pm
, the orcas were heading both north and south.
*
Dick and I left the whales at
4.15 pm
, still in two groups, one to the south of
Foulweather Bluff
, one to the north. Those 'at the south end' were in the vicinity of two boats (NOAA maybe?) and less distinct. Those 'at the north end' were making their way slowly north, and appeared to be foraging or milling with some breaching and spyhopping behavioural activity.

Ivan Reiff of Western Prince whale watch called at

4:15 pm
to report he had been flying from San Juan Island to Seattle, and timed it right to see the pod of orcas between
Point No Point
(N. Kitsap Peninsula)
& Double Bluff
(Whidbey Isl) at about

3:45 pm
. There were ~10 north of Pt. No Point, and a few more south of Pt. No Point, and he observed them making a kill. The NOAA boat was with the whales.

John Fortin of Hansville called to report 3
orcas
between
Foulweather Bluff
and
Bush Pt
, including a male, a female and a calf at

3:45 pm.
He reported 2 boats and the KOMO news chopper on site.
*
This is Heather Hoins on
Marrowstone
- I just saw them (
orcas
) as well -

3:30 pm
- they appear to be going in small circles - right smack in the middle of the shipping channel - I only saw 3 maybe 4 individuals and no male. Heather also called in a report of 4 orcas, including 1 male, off S. Marrowstone at
11:58 am, heading south, nearing Foulweather Bluff.
*
I have them (the
orcas
) at
Double Bluff
at

3:20
. Looks like maybe a half dozen transients, including at least one juve?

After receiving a call from Rick Huey of orcas southbound in Admiralty Inlet, we headed over to
Bush Pt.
to see if we could find and ID them. At around

10:20 am
we caught our first glimpse of the
orcas
- a male, 2 females and a calf midway down Marrowstone Island heading south. At
11:05 am another group of 4 - 5 came through, closer to the Whidbey side. At

11:07
we spotted more whales to the north heading our way!
11:15 am, we spotted 6 - 7 orcas just north of Bush Pt, circling & hunting close to the Whidbey side.
11:30 am, the last large group (we thought....) was heading south past Bush Pt. At
11:45 am, ~6 orcas were in a resting line between Skunk Bay and Mutiny Bay, heading south. At
11:50 am, the last group was off Foulweather Bluff (~10+). At this point we estimated we'd seen 16 - 20 whales total. Then, at noon, we saw 8+ blows way on the other side off Foulweather Bluff & the entrance to Hood Canal. At
12:15 pm we saw 6 blows off Foulweather Bluff - all whales seemed to be traveling south at a good pace, & were moving out of our line of sight, so we headed back home - after having observed 25+ orcas pass by! After viewing our photos and video, we were able to confirm our suspicions that this was the pod of 27 Transients observed off Victoria B.C. on Weds. What a thrill to get to see them all - a rare Transient Superpod!

Pat Scott of
Bush Pt
, Whidbey Island called to report 5 - 6
orcas
, including 1 calf off Bush Pt, heading south toward Mutiny Bay at

10:25 am
.
*
Orca Network received a call from a woman reporting
orcas
off
Lagoon Pt
, Whidbey Island at

10:15 am
heading south.
*
Karen Edelblute called Orca Network at

9:56 am
to report 4
orcas
off N.
Lagoon Pt
., mid-channel, heading south toward Bush Pt.
*
Rick Huey of Washington State Ferries called Orca Network at

9:15 am
to report observing several
orcas
mid-channel off Marrowstone Island, heading south. Rick called again at

10:30 am
to report another group of 4 - 6 orcas heading past the haul out off Marrowstone Island, heading south, closer to the east side of Admiralty Inlet.
*
We did see
Transient orca
T100's calf and a lot of rolling around with the prey. We are pretty certain it was a
minke
from our photos.
Candi Emmons, NOAA Fisheries NWFSC, Seattle

Not sure what kind of whale I saw (still green at whale ID), but it crossed in front of the ferry while it was still docked at
Mukilteo
around

3:30 p.m.
It was dark colored, short dorsal fin and I saw its back surface several times. It was alone as far as I could tell.
Margi Hartnett, Clinton, WA
We have received emails from Matt Purcell & Margi Hartnett confirming that their sightings were of the
humpback
after looking at the photo posted in the last whale report -sb.
*
At

10:30am
a
gray
was spotted traveling south about 100 yards off shore directly in front of
Tulalip Shores
. We heard and saw the gray surface twice before it was out of sight. About about 4 minutes elapsed between the two sightings. The last time it sufaced and gave two quick blows and then dove, exposing the tail.
