Orca Sightings for February 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were kayaking north of hood head and
hood canal bridge
, just south of driftwood key and saw a small
whale
in shallow water. I thought it might be small grey whale. It surfaced several times while we were launching from shore. It was a low tide, about
3:30 pm and we were at the water's edge and the whale was about 30 yards off.

3:06 PM
-
Shilshole
in background for location - we saw it initially about an hour earlier moving to the southwest, same general area, then again moving back to the north/northeast. Looking like a
humpback
from what I've seen online and from talking to people. Was about 30' long and about 10' wide from what we could see - never saw the tail.

At about

2:10pm
I and a few other happy spotters saw what we speculate was a solitary Minke (possibly a
humpback
) just offshore from
Shilshole Marina
in Ballard. We were up on the cliff at Sunset Hill Park. One watcher had binoculars, but from that distance all we could see was a small dorsal and the blow. The whale surfaced multiple times as it headed south. It disappeared for a few minutes, then reappeared a bit farther offshore. A nice bit of magic on an already beautiful sunny afternoon.

I saw what I believe to be the Minke whale (possibly a
humpback
) from the lighthouse at
Discovery park
(looking towards Golden Gardens) diving at around
noon
. I saw it dive once but did not see it resurface. It was black/dark colored.

We have received emails from Matt Purcell & Margi Hartnett confirming that their sightings were of the humpback after looking at the photo posted in the last whale report. -sb
