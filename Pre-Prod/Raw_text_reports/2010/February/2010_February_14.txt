Orca Sightings for February 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Patty Michak of Hansville called to report a pod of
orcas
passing
Point No Point
, N. Kitsay Peninsula at

5:30 pm
tonight. She heard them blowing but didn't see them, but some neighbors saw them and identified them as orcas, heading south and moving quickly.

We had our resident
Transients
the T030's with T172 again in the
afternoon
near
Race Rocks
east bound.
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

Well, he (
Gray whale
) was back again today. About
4 p.m.
and he hung around out front feeding again. South of
Sandy Point
on the east side of Whidbey in front of Witter Beach Place. Enjoyed watching him for about 40 minutes. Happy Valentines Day! I found out from our neighbor that he (Gray whale) was out here this morning around
ten
too but we missed him. And then he came back this evening and we sat outside under our heater and watched and listened to him in the dark until
7'ish
- just magical!
