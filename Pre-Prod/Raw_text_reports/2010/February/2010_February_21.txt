Orca Sightings for February 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving a report from Mark Malleson of
L's
heading south along the Vancouver Island shoreline, Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research launched Starlet in Roche Harbor around 1530 and arrived on scene at
1610
. The
L12
subpod was traveling slowly south in Cordova Bay. Both L94 and L77 were traveling with calves and we were able to confirm that L113 was L94's calf. L77's calf (L114) was very young and still had fetal folds. Around 1700 near the south end of Cordova Bay, the L12s turned east and spread out and began foraging. Lots of taillobs, cartwheels and pec slaps out of L79, L85, and L89. L89 also breached twice and whales up ahead of us looked to be going after some fish. We left the whales at 1711 still spread out and heading east. Whales photographed were
L12, L22, L25, L41, L77 and L114, L94 and L113, L79, L85, and L89
.

We received a report at

11:00 am
that whales had been spotted in
Swanson Channel
off Morseby Island heading north. From shore at Thieves Bay Marina we observed whales traveling in a tight group about 500m off shore. Identified in this large group of 20+ whales were, members of
J pod, K pod and L87
. Shoreline observers: Lisa Moorby and Richard Philpot

I'd like to report a whale sighting.

2:00 pm
, west coast of
Whidbey Island
, Puget Sound, WA, 100-200 yards off the beach at
Perego's Lagoon, Ebey's Landing
(lat/long: N 48.20134 W 122.73964). 1 whale, species unknown. NOT an Orca. (We assume it was a minke or gray whale but don't really know.) Behavior: Staying in one place, diving for ~5 minutes, then surfacing, blowing once or twice, and diving again. We watched the whale for about an hour (from the bluff top, then down on the beach); the whale was still there when we left. There is a kelp bed just off shore at this location. Weather & Tide: 50s, clear & sunny, very calm seas, low tide.

This sounds like the Gray whale reported by two people on Saturday afternoon, must be finding enough food to stick around for awhile!

Someone had spotted
J pod
headed north up
Swanson Ch
. toward Active Pass. Off we headed north. Around Navy Ch. we spotted them. They were in a slow resting pattern, working into an ebb tide. The light was amazing, reflecting off their blows. As we hit the dock a message came through the some
Ls
had been sighted north of
Cordova Bay
close to shore headed south toward Victoria. We found them in about twenty minutes, and shortly thereafter Ken Balcomb and David Ellifrit showed up to photograph the Ls. I just got a call from Jeanne Hyde, who was with us today, and she thinks there were some
Ks with the Js
! We left the Js headed either up
Trincomali Ch.
or Active Pass at
2:45. The Ls were still headed south in Cordova Bay at
4:30.

I went out with Capt. Jim today after hearing that
J Pod
wasn't far away. When we met up with them they were in a resting pattern and were passing along one of the Canadian Gulf Islands, heading up
Swanson Channel
. With the cliff as a backdrop and the sun in the sky their blows were accented magnificently. But there was more,
K pod
whales were with them! I will have to go over all the images but at a glance were Georgia K-11, Onyx L-87, Spock K-20, Comet K-38. Also seen in J pod were a few who maybe weren't seen in late January. They are Spieden J-8, Shachi J-19 and her youngster J-41. Then an hour later
L Pod
whales showed up coming south. It appeared to be at least the
L-12s
and there was a calf traveling with Calypso L-94. But there was another calf too!! Alexis L-12, Mystery L-85, Mega L-41 etc.

I stumbled into the
L12's
heading south along Island View Beach just south of
Sidney
, B.C. Cheers,

The experience of finding
J Pod
in a resting formation at
2.15pm
just off shore of Prevost Island was simply awe inspiring. Their slow, methodical misty blows were entrancing to watch in the spectacular light and calm conditions. We watched for a while and left them in the same resting pattern. It appeared by the large number of Orca that all members of the pod were there. Our magical day was not over even then. As we headed back to Victoria, just off Island View Beach we were surprised by more misty 'blows' and who should pop up but members of L Pod. Totally incredible and so unexpected. L 41, 'Mega' was the first to be ID by Mark. We had very little time with them as needed to be back in Victoria, but WOW , what an experience since my last three trips out, we had come up empty.

Approx. 9
orcas
sighted off
Island View Beach
heading south from Sidney through the passage between James Island and Island View Beach and on towards
Victoria
, at around

3:25 PM
, traveling fairly quickly. There was definitely at least one very large male, dorsal fin was very large in comparison to the others. There was also at least one calf with them, possibly two.

Marshall Tripp called Orca Network to report
2 Gray whales
off
Bush Pt., SW Whidbey Island
at

10:20 am
, 3/4 mile out and heading south.
*
Observed two
whales
- seemed to be humpbacks? from dorsals and flukes - heading south at approx. 10 am, sounding four times as they passed through the
Bush Point
rip.

We'll let you know if we get any photos or further confirmation on the species of the above reported 2 whales at Bush Pt. - we did have 2 Grays off SW Whidbey on Saturday, but have also had confirmed sightings of a humpback whale off SW Whidbey as well~

We haven't been fortunate to see the
Gray whale
yet, but at low tide this
afternoon
the very distinctive feeding pits were visible for the first time this season on our beach just south of Mabana.
