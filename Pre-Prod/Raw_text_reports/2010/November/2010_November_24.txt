Orca Sightings for November 24, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I wanted to let you know we saw
a whale
sighting in
Budd Bay
at

8:48 a.m.
(11/24) viewing from the west shore of the bay. A surfacing marine mammal rose up 4 times heading north. The interval of surfacing was about 2-3 minutes. Three adults saw the mammals. I did not see any dorsal fins but my daughter did report seeing a dorsal fin on the third surfacing. We are located at 27th Avenue NW Olympia. I also learned that a friend, Kyle Lintz who lives on Eld Inlet saw a whale the following day and reported it on his Facebook page.
