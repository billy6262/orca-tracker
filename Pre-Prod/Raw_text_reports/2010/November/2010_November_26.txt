Orca Sightings for November 26, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ron Bates of MMRG in Victoria, BC relayed this report from Mark Malleson:
T49A's (Transient orcas) off Victoria
going S.W.
1615
. Mallard says there is a new calf.
*
Thanks to Jeff (LaMarche) for spotting the
Transients
while at Ogden Point breakwater. Saw the
T049A's and T049B's
south of the Victoria Harbour entrance feeding on a probable seal. Left them @ 1615 headed west for Albert Head.

Jeff LaMarche (Eagle Wing Tours) was walking along the downtown
Victoria
breakwater with his kids at about

3:15 pm
, and just off the end of the breakwater
five Transient orcas
appear - totally cool!
