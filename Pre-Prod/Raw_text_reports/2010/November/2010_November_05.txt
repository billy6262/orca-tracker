Brad Hanson picked me up in the NOAA research zodiac at Lagoon Point (west
Whidbey Island
) at

1:20 pm
, and in about 15 minutes we saw two breaches a few miles to the south toward Foulweather Bluff, which aptly describes the drizzly skies. Soon we could see occasional blows, fins and splashes miles away to the east and south. We first found L82 with her distinctive crooked dorsal and her new baby L116. For the next 3.5 hours we traveled only a few miles, finding members of
all three pods
, including L47 and L115, K13, J42, J30, L91, K16, J8, L88, L72 and L105 and J14, in that order. These IDs are preliminary and not all inclusive, awaiting confirmation of IDs by the Center for Whale Research. We saw a few more breaches and spyhops, and lots of foraging and socializing, probably mostly socializing, because other than a single salmon scale we didn't find any remains or fecal matter to determine prey. The whales were moving slowly and very spread out in groups of one to four, all across Admiralty Inlet for several miles north to south, no doubt calling constantly as they moved gradually north. We left them back we started at Lagoon Point at
4:45 pm.

After receiving reports of
Southern Resident orcas
heading north in Admiralty Inlet, Howard headed out to meet up with Brad Hanson & the NOAA boat, while I went to the west side of Whidbey Island to try to locate the whales in the fog and drizzle from the shoreline. After looking for quite some time, at

1:35 pm
I finally located a fin or two from the north end of Mutiny Bay, SW
Whidbey island
. They were mid-channel, heading north - but VERY spread out, few and far between, with a lot of fog rolling in and out making sighting them from land difficult. I went further north and again saw a fin or two heading north at
2:10 off Bush Pt, where I could also just barely make out the NOAA boat in the fog. I gave up at that point, but apparently missed getting to see some come closer to shore later (see report below)! When I got back I tuned into the Pt. Townsend OrcaSound hydrophone, and heard the first
calls
at about

4:50 pm
, and listened until around 6 pm when ship noise drowned them out and the calls got fainter as the whales continued north.

Saw [
orcas
] from
Bush Pt.
around

3:30
or so. I'm guessing they numbered somewhere in the vicinity of 12 to 15 (hard to tell with the fog and they were pretty spread out). Just beautiful!

Patty Michak called Orca Network to report seeing the

at

11:30 am
from Hansville/Pt. No Point,
N. Kitsap Peninsula
, heading north closer to the Whidbey Island side.
*
Orca Network received a call from someone on the
Edmonds/Kingston Ferry
at

8:55 am
, reporting "
orcas
all over the place" in the ferry lanes, heading north.
