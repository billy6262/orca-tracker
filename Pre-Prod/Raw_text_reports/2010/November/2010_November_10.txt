Orca Sightings for November 10, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jim Maya called to report seeing at least
3 Humpback whales
from Land Bank on west
San Juan Island
at

3:05 pm
Wednesday. They were 4 - 5 miles out, but he could see the blows with his naked eye - the lighting on the blows was amazing!

I encountered
4 Minke Whales
at
Eastern Bank
on the way back from Port Townsend today. Two of them were cruising side by side, often coming up in unison. Pretty cool! We encountered the whales at about

4:15 PM
right at the south end of Eastern Bank. We also observed quite a bit of bait fish jumping out of the water in the area.

At

1:15 p.m.
due east of Lilliwaup, WA on
Hood Canal
: A series of large whale blows, looking much those of a gray whale. The whale did not show much of itself, so I cannot confirm the I.D.

I read the report (in the Nov. 12 Orca Network Whale Report) about the
gray whale
sighting in
Hood Canal
. I also saw something like a blow in front of the Glen Ayre Resort on 101, just north of Hoodsport on Wed. the 10th about

11:45a.m.
I almost turned back, but noticed a lot of fish and seal activity in the water, so thought maybe it was just a seal eating a salmon, as they often kick up the water. But this sighting confirms my suspicions!!
