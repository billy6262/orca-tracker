I receive a call from Ivan of the Western Prince that whales were spotted in
San Juan Channel
heading south. I was able to find them when they approached Cattle Pass.
T-63
, known as Chainsaw, and two others, one with a notch at the base of the tailing edge. They made a kill just past Goose Island and then continued on out of the pass. Photos and more of the story on my blog. Thanks!
