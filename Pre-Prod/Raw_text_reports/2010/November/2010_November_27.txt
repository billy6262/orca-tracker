============================================================

Entry 1:
Approx.
4 Orcas
came through
Plumper Sound
between Pender Island and
Saturna Island, B.C
. First time I have seen whales here. I heard later on that they were seen off South Pender and had taken a Harbor Seal off some rocks there.

were headed west in the morning east of
Race Rocks
. The T049A's and T049B's were south of Victoria harbour at the same time and foraged throughout the area all day. I left the T049A group at 1545 near William Head pointed east.
