I watched a small group of
harbor porpoise
from the ferry while it was at the Lopez Island ferry landing afternoon
~3pm
. The group was a fair distance maybe 400m or so and I was not able to get a good handle on the number though I did pick up at least one mother-calf pair. They appeared to be foraging, until splitting into 2 groups and moving away. One traveled northward toward Shaw Island.
