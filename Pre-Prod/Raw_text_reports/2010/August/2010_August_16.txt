Orca Sightings for August 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
It isn't always on a trip that one gets to see family groups traveling tightly as a unit but that was what was happening. As far as the eye could see, many of the
SR Orca
were coming in from the west past
Discovery Island
at
5pm
. We saw
J14
, and all her family with little,
J45
breaching all over the place. One could see he is a little boy that was for sure!
Granny and Ruffles
traveled too with this group and were enjoying the exuberance of the little one. A very magical experience. They continued to travel east and north up Haro Strait at 5.30pm.

While with
transients
we received a report of
residents
inbound at race rocks. After leaving the
T18's
CWR staff Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster, Stewart Macintyre, and Kathy Babiak headed out to catch up with them. We encountered
L83, L110, L47, L115, L95 and L91
in a tight group heading east at

3:37 p.m.
(48° 25.34 N; 123° 06.76 W). We also encountered
L55
and
L82
, with
L106, L112, L109, L103 and L27
in a tight group. Later we came across
L54, L5, L72, L105, L26, L90, L92 and L41
loosely grouped traveling north east. There was some surface activity and a lot of tactile behavior. We ended the encounter with
L84, L54, L100
and a couple of others spread out and milling at

5:03 p.m.
(48° 27.29 N; 123° 05.83 W).

We had just traveled from the west having seen a mother and calf
Humpback Whale
south at
Constance Bank
, in the strait of Juan de Fuca. The youngster too was breaching all over the place close to its mom. It was very windy and rough in those waters so it seemed the humpbacks were enjoying the texture and were full of energy. They continued to travel west at
4.45pm
. We then joined the Orca and were thrilled by their antics (see above report). These are such happy whales right now!

There were four
Transients
circling
Patos Island
for many hours. There were countless tail fluke slaps, breaches, head views and lots more. It was chaotic with all the pleasure boats and a whale watch company circling the island with them.

Center for Whale Reserach vessels and staff encountered
T18, T19, T19B, and T19C
off the
Java Islets
shoreline (48° 43.623 N; 123° 09.929 W) at

11:36 a.m
. We arrived on scene to witness the end of T19B attacking a harbor porpoise. He made several big lunges before he rejoined T19, T19C and T18. We followed them up
Boundary Pass
and observed them actively hunting around the Java Islets, before leaving them heading NE off East Point at

2:07 p.m
.(48° 48.49 N;123° 00.009 W).
