Entry 1:
We received more information about the
two orcas
sighted off the

Neah Bay
(48 16'36.37N; 124 56'55.95W); and ID'd by Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research and Graeme Ellis of DFO's Pacific Biological Field Station as Transient orcas T7 and T7A.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report the
L22's, L85, L12's L77, L41
etc came down from
Turn Point
along the west side of San Juan Is. The others went north to Coal Docks.

Superpod!
As usual they impressed us with tons of breaches, tail slaps, pec slaps and lots more! We were lucky to spend time with members from
all three pods
. First with the
J2
matriline, then with
L26, L84, K21, K40
and many others, topped off by a pass from
J28
and her calf
J46
. The whales were about 5 miles north of Active Pass in the
Strait of Georgia

At approximately
3 PM
members of
J, K and L pods
slowly passed by Lighthouse Marine Park,
Point Roberts
Washington. A lot of foraging and a little one did a few consecutive breaches. The many 50 plus orcas were spread out over miles. They navigated around the gill netters and purse seiners.
