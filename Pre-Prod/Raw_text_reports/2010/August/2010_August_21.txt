Breathtaking encounter with 2 very Acrobatic
Humpback
in the morning! We were only a few miles south of
Victoria
this morning when 2 Humpback Whales,
a Mother and Calf
, were spotted. The first glimpse of the Humpbacks I had was when the youngster Cartwheeled, and we were still a couple of miles away from the scene. Not long after we arrived on scene the young Calf began to cartwheel and tail lob, then suddenly to everyone's delight the youngster breached multiple times, it was amazing! Then the mother also Cartwheeled and tail slapped, we even had the two animals doing synchronized tail lobs: ) We left the two Humpbacks just heading East towards Dungeness Spit into the fog after an amazing encounter!

Once again, mother
Humpback Whale
and her youngster were seen out there in the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, south of
Victoria
, entertaining the WW boats. Conditions were very challenging at
4.30pm
. I do believe with the wind at 25-30knots, and the water at a 3ft chop or more, those whales were totally energised. The spectacle certainly got me excited. They breached repeatedly, tail and pec slapped the surface for 45 mins. The youngster appeared to imitate the mother especially when it came to pec slaps. They headed off toward the west when we left them. Totally amazing encounter.
