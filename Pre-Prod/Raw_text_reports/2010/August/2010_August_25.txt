Orca Sightings for August 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had an after dinner treat in three parts this evening. Starting around

7:40 pm
, the first of 3 groups of
orcas
entered
Active Pass
, heading east. In the first bunch was Mr. Ruffles. The 3rd group was the most active, with many tail slaps. It took about an hour for all of them to pass our viewpoint on Galiano Island and head into the light of the moonrise.

Some of our
Southern Residents
were spy-hopping, porpoising and breaching between
Lime Kiln
and Victoria around
2.00 pm
- not sure who was out there as choppy seas made ID difficult, but our passengers were just happy to see whales!

The
T018's
were found again in the afternoon just north of
Beaumont Shoals
. I left them with Dave Ellifrit and Ken Balcomb just north of
Limekiln
headed north west along the San Juan shoreline at
1715
. It looked as though they took out a harbor porpoise south of Edwards Point.

We went out (from
Monterey Bay, CA
) with Nancy Black her Company, perfect trip and nice people. We did not see any blues - but saw
3 humpbacks
(see tailslapping humpback here), and a Nursing group of Risso's dolphins @ Monterey bay, more in the Canyon.
