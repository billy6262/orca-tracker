============================================================

Entry 1:
Spotted
Orcas
heading South in the
Tacoma Narrows
right in front of Doc Hastings Park (Now called Narrows bridge park) at

13:30 hours
. They were not in a big hurry and were headed to Fox Island. Not sure what pod they are from.
Capt Jim Keith, Fox Island Salmon Charters
this is most likely a pod of Transients, possibly the same pod reported in the other sightings above in S. Puget Sound - ON.

(NW San Juan Island) while putting together today's whale report! Tuned in at

4:30 pm
