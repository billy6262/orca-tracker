to say she was watching at least
4 orcas
- 1 male and 3 smaller including one very small - in Oakland Bay (

This morning my husband and I saw
3 orcas
traveling south to north along the west side of
Squaxin Island
(S. Puget Sound) about 7 a.m. None of them had a big fin.

Watched as what looked to be
three orcas
moved north up Oakland Bay near
Shelton
with the flooding tide, then when the tide turned they retreated to the south, where the bay connects to Hammersley Inlet which is the connection to the main sound. There was one orca who was larger, a mid-size and a smaller one in this group. We watched from the porch of our house which is about at the middle of the bay between Shelton and the Deer Creek peninsula that is the northern boundary of the main bay.
