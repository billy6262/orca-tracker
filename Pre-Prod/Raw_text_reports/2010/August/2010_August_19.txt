Orca Sightings for August 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
two pm
we were on a whale watch boat off the west side of
San Juan Island
(I believe that we were just south of False Bay) and we encountered maybe a dozen
Southern Residents
. We were able to positively identify L-85 and I believe L-47 as well. Others on our boat captured images that the naturalist identified as being members of K-pod. The orcas were spread out over an area of maybe 400 yards, but four of them kept getting quite close to our boat, and one even came up directly underneath us.

We were with the
superpod
on the west side of
San Juan Island
, and several passengers got pictures of a female breaching. I was taking a look at the pictures afterward, trying to identify the individuals, and I think it was
J2 Granny
! There's the little curved notch in the middle of her straight dorsal fin, and her right side saddle patch has that long skinny tail reaching forward. I asked several passengers to send me their breaching pictures; so far the only one I've received is this one by Bob Miszuk (above photo). If you open it on full resolution you should be able to see the identifying marks I saw - what do you think? Is that her? If it is, how wonderful to know she's still feeling so spry at her age!

Yup, it's Granny and she still has a lot of spunk! ON

We got to spend some time with
K12
, her new calf
K43
and
K37
. K12 seemed preoccupied with fishing but her calf was all over her with tail slaps and breaches, the little one had everyone on the boat laughing at it's antics.
K37
(Rainshadow) came along and took care of his new brother/sister with a little bit of playing and affection. I think that K43 is showing some mammary slits? Possibly a baby girl!
