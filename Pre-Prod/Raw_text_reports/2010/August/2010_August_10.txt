Orca Sightings for August 10, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We observed
4 Transients
, one mature male and 3 females/immature males, near
Constance Bank
about 4 miles south of
Victoria
around

12:30pm
. The male was swimming alone and the 3 others were together quite a distance away at first, then all 4 joined up together. No fancy acrobatics, but great to see them out in the middle of the Strait on a beautiful day.

Also saw a
Minke
whale surface just south of
Cattle Point (SJI)
at

13:30
. And several solo
harbor porpoises
viewed on the way up from Seattle and back (just west of Deception Pass, in Admiralty Inlet, and by the Edmonds-Kingston ferry crossing.)

I took pictures of the new calf in the
Georgia Strait
today. We had members from
all three pods
heavily foraging on the many sockeye off the mouth of the Fraser River.
