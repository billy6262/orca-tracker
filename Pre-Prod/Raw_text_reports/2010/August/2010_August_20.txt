I went out on Dolphin Surveys. We cut across the bay at PG and headed towards Capitola,
Monterey Bay CA
. On the north side of the "Soquel Hole" we ran into a pod of
5 Orcas
. The largest one has the cut dorsal fin. When I first saw it I thought it was a submarine conning tower. Anyway, the orcas dove and 4 of them came up at the back of the 20 foot boat - 2 on each side. The photo looking at the blow hole also has the side cleat for the boat bumpers in the left corner of the photo. They bumped the boat and then moved off and kept heading their original direction. Fortunately they were just curious (or putting us in our place) and not hungry or aggressive. We've seen just about everything crossing the bay but there is something about being in a 20 foot boat and being checked out by Orcas. They sure didn't have to worry about us harassing them.

And from Alisa Schulman-Janiger, these IDs of the orcas photographed: Thanks so much for sending on these killer whale pics from yesterday's Dolphin Surveys! Robert saw some well-known transients that frequent Monterey Bay. I call the male "Chopfin" (in photo shown). He is also known as CA217 (N29). He was first photographed in 1998 off of Santa Catalina Island in southern California with the other whale you sent: CA216 (N28). He has been seen as far north as Washington, and as far south as Dana Point, CA. Very few of our killer whale have such damaged fins; he is quite recognizable. Thanks again!
