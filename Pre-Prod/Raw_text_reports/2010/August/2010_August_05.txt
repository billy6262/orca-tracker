Orca Sightings for August 5, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca
calf and adult (L Pod?) SW off of
San Juan Island
,
3 PM
.
Rudy & Barbara Deck, Oak Harbor
*
Whales north near
Vancouver
, just south of the Vancouver airport, and lots of them! Superpod with lots of breaching, tail slaps and of course, mating! After hanging out with the whales we went and found
White Sided dolphins
!

We saw
L's Mega, Mystery, and Crewser
again, traveling with Indigo heading south along the west side of
San Juan Island
just south of Eagle Point. Crewser and Mystery were traveling so close together that until we did some careful identification we thought it was just one male.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries found the pod of
Transient orcas
at

4:30 pm
, hunting off
Bainbridge Island
. It appeared they were in the process of making a kill, with no direction of travel. They left them about

6:10
off Kingston, in mid-channel, headed north. It's the same male and juvenile and probably the same four that were there
July 28 (T101, T101A, T101B, and T102). They observed one predation of probably a seal.
*
We were very surprised on our way home to meet up with
T102
traveling with another male and a female, northbound just south of
Edmonds
. Just before we spotted them we noticed a number of harbor porpoises moving quickly, perhaps trying to avoid becoming a meal!

At approximately
1330
hours, I witnessed via my binoculars,
3 Orcas
(one seemed smaller than the others) heading south along the eastern shore (maybe 300 yards offshore) of Puget Sound beginning at about the area where Talbot Road and Olympic View Drive meet in
Edmonds
. I witnessed for the next 20-30 minutes heading along the shoreline before I discontinued watching them before they reached the Edmonds Ferry dock.

About a 1/4 mile north of
Edmonds
Ferry, just this side of mid channel, we spotted two older males, 2 females and one smaller
Orca
together surfacing in a steady pattern heading south. Once they past the ferry dock we drove to Marina Beach (South Edmonds) and they were just passing, much more spread out. We watched them surface until they were near the peninsula nearing what we think is Jefferson Point? just east of Indianola. We left them at

2:30
, they were still heading south (with a couple of Harbor Porpoise in tow).
