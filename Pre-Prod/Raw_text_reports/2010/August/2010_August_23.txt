Orca Sightings for August 23, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
A distant sighting of
orcas
against a sunset from the Queen of Nanaimo Gulf Island ferry just off
Tsawwassen
, around

7:45 pm
. The group was very spread out and moved leisurely.

1:13 am
-
calls
on
OrcaSound hydrophone
. There was quite a parade of killer whales up Haro Strait tonight. At least 15 individuals were visible tail lobbing and splashing in the gibbous moonlight as they traveled northward only 30-50m offshore around midnight. A (last?) smaller group (of 3-4) passed around
01:25 without making calls and may have been resting (breathing synchronously).

Today they were headed for the
Fraser River
. But we also had the
L12s
down at the south end of the island!

Loud
calls
and whistles again at
Lime Kiln,
12:05 am
. We heard some calls at
OrcaSound
as a ship was going through, then more calls at Lime Kiln - a noisy party still going on!
