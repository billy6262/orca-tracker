Orca Sightings for October 2, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out kayaking in the south sound on Saturday afternoon (about

2:30PM
) and spotted single
Orca
feeding just south of the
Harstine Island
bridge in Pickering Passage and the the bay southwest of the bridge. I think it must have been a male as the dorsal fin was quite large. I couldn't see any markings on it as it went past me. And unfortunately, I didn't have a camera with me. I know of one other person that saw the same whale from shore. They have owned property there for 42 years and never have seen a whale in that area.

Ten minutes off the dock and we were mobbed by about
20 Dall's Porpoise
. We used to see them every day, but lately these kinds of encounters are rare. They attacked the Peregrine to the delight of our passengers. The photo above is of a Dall's Porpoise and hybrid porpoise. Father a harbor porpoise and mother a Dall's.
