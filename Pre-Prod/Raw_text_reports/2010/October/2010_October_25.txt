Orca Sightings for October 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Peter Furman reported seeing a large
pod of orcas
(~15 - 20) heading south past Useless Bay/Double Bluff, west
Whidbey Island
around
9 am
.
*
Port Townsend (hydrophone)
is proving to be a great test bed for Val's auto-detection algorithm. I thought these were false positives, but not so upon listening carefully - Seems the
SRKWs
came in to Puget Sound between

6:09 and
06:13
.

When Ed and I left the bluff at
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park (Shoreline)
at

4:00pm
and could still spot the
Orca
heading in a southerly direction. A few were still east of mid channel, out from the RB park and could see many farther south past Carkeek (N. Seattle) and heading towards West Point lighthouse at Discovery Park. All the while seeing breaching, tail lobbing, porpoising. Quite spread out the entire time we were watching from

2:15-
4:00pm
, in groups of 2-4. 4 pm: Still watching them head south, we were just at kayu kayu park just south of point wells, stll coming. Have seen 4 mature males, and another 15 females/yonug boys and some calves. Yes ,same as Dave (see below report) -tail lobs and earlier a couple of breaches. Foraging, milling, feeding, porpoising. General direction south. more to come.

1:55 pm
:
Orcas
! At least two spotted just off Point Wells, headed south towards
Richmond Beach (Edmonds, WA
) . Guessing more are out there!
3 pm
update: Many more continuing to swim past. Looked like mom and a young 'un about 10 minutes ago. Now some bigger adults, including a large male who showed me two big tail lobs (seen through binoculars). All directly east of the SF mid-channel buoy, maybe 0.5-1 mile off Richmond Beach.
4 pm
: 6 more
orcas
, 5 females and a youngster, all seen over the last 5 minutes. The last group of 4 had 1 female in the lead, with 3 others following just behind her, all coming up for air as a group. Looks like they're having fun out in those waves! All sightings still due east of mid-channel buoy. About 10 minutes ago I saw a couple of amazing breaches by a juvenile orca. The first onto its belly, the second on its side/back. Seems to be hanging with 2-3 other females. Also, one large male closer in, circling and cruising back and forth.

Orca Network received a call from Patty Michak about
10 am
reporting
orcas
heading south past
Point No Point
, N. Kitsap Peninsula into Puget Sound. At

10:45 am
, she sent this update: I would estimate that
20++ whales
went past Point No Point from 10am-
10:30am, numerous males, and female and calf pairs. The number was hard to estimate as some would turn back and circle around. Looked like some feeding as there was some circling and lunging and the gulls gathered around, but most were moving into Puget Sound. A couple spectacular breaches! Sorry no photos they were just too far offshore. A great way to start the week! Thanks,
