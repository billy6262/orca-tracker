Orca Sightings for October 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm glad to see a couple of
humpback
sightings in this report, which makes me feel more confident of what I'm about to tell you. This is second-hand, but there were close to a dozen people who did see it for sure. I was returning from
Victoria
on the MV Coho. At about

3:50 PM
(which would have put us just past halfway across) some passengers sighted at least two whales, probably humpbacks from their descriptions, off the west side of the stern.

We slowly made our way out of Cattle Pass and were soon rewarded with reports of
Residents
about 6 miles south of
Hein Bank
. Whales were soon plainly visible and were in a mood to play. Lots of slow swimming, and rolling at the surface. Lots of spyhops, and one young male (couldn't get an ID) even breached while exhibiting a sea snake!

Jill Hein called to report
orcas
off
Ft. Casey
, then sent this update: at
10 am
they were past Fort Casey (Victoria Clipper was with them), then around
10:20 I spotted them from Ebey Landing - still heading north. A 2nd Clipper vessel joined them for about 15 minutes or so. Seemed like lots of activity, but they were a long way off Whidbey shores. I'd estimate at least a dozen, with a couple of very large dorsals.

Chrissy McLean of Pt. Townsend Marine Science Center called to report the
orcas
just passed Admiralty Head at

9:50 am
- the Pt. Townsend/Keystone ferry was with them. They weren't hearing any calls on the PTMSC hydrophone, but were seeing the whales from the PTMSC. Then at

10:13 am
sent this update: Just saw several groups of whales heading out north past
Admiralty Head
with the Victoria Clipper. At least two groups-- one about 4 whales, and one about 20 whales. No vocalizations.

At

10:00am
the Victoria Clipper was stopped just outside
Admiralty Head
, with a number of
orcas
close by. Couldn't see much detail from here at Ledgewood, and there were whitecaps on the water, but the passengers must have had a great look.

Mike Waitt of Greenbank called Orca Network to report
2+ orcas
heading north in
Admiralty Inlet
at

8:36 am
, 2 miles north of Bush Pt, on the east side, approaching Lagoon Pt. He called back at
8:38 am to say they were watching another 5 - 6 orcas, they were about 1/4 mile apart, about 5 miles off Lagoon Pt.

Orca Network received a call from The Scotts reporting a pod of
orcas

8:15 am, heading north, reaching Lagoon Pt. at around

It is always good to see
T14, 'Pender
' traveling as usual mostly, all alone. He was heading in from the west. We located him east of
Race Rocks
heading slowly toward Victoria. Apparently sometime yesterday afternoon,
October 8th, he was seen taking a late lunch, but not during our trip. We did meet up with
three Humpback whales
that were rather playful. One or two Steller Sea Lions were seen among the three. Perhaps disturbing their foraging. Always good to see these 'gentle giants'.

In addition to seeing
Orcas
, we had a lone
Humpback
swimming down
San Juan Channel
! What an amazing day! You just never know what you'll see on an adventure!
