Orca Sightings for October 26, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a return trip to Victoria, B.C. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered the
T2's and T123's
mid
Haro Strait
, just south of Stuart Island at

4:44 p.m
(48째 38.272 N; 123째 14.709 W). The whales were traveling north. The encounter ended just off Turn Point at
5:40 p.m.(48째 40.640 N; 123째 15.027 W).

Al Luneman reported lots of
orca
fins milling about, in very choppy seas, roughly on a line between Partidge Pt., Whidbey Island, and Protection Island, at

3:50 pm
.

Chrissy McLean at PTMSC just called -

2:25 pm
- she has sighted the
orcas
, including a few males (saw J-1 from
Point Wilson
several times), heading NW out of Admiralty Inlet, just north of Lagoon Pt.

calls

Port Townsend hydrophones
!

At

1:54 pm
we began hearing faint
calls & whistles
on the OrcaSound
Pt. Townsend hydrophone
. Soon the calls became much louder and clearer as the So. Residents headed out of Admiralty Inlet.

As I was coming home from Stuart Island I heard we had some
Transients
nearby, and I had the opportunity to watch the
T2s
and
T123s
foraging in
Haro Strait
. I think they made one kill (lots of direction changes and spyhops). I left them at
1730
mid Haro Channel approaching Turn Point heading North. Center for Whale Research and NOAA were still on scene.

These Ts (
T123s & T2s
) made no effort to move away from the freighter. I've seen them countless times deal with ferries, freighters, and crazy recreational boaters in the same nonchalant way. Steller Sea lions, on the other hand, really have something to worry about. There were about 25 of them within 5 miles of these Transient, mammal eating, Orcas. I've seen Orcas attack and eat Stellers on many occasions.
