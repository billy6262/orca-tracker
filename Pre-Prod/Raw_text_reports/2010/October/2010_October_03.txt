K25 "Scoter" was demonstrating his flying skills! We were with
J's, K's, and a few L's
(namely
L87, L7, and L53
) in
Boundary Pass
traveling SW in tight groups at approx.
1400
. Lots of percussive behaviors - loads of breaches (I stopped counting after 30 or so), spyhops, tail lobs, and dorsal fin slaps. Everyone seemed to be in an energetic mood!
