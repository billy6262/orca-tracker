Orca Sightings for October 11, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
This photo of the South Sound mystery whale was taken by Jerry Seymore, in
Totten Inlet
on Monday night around
5 pm
. Given the distance of the photo we're not entirely certain, but it looks like it might be a
minke
.

Saw these guys (
Pacific White-sided dolphins
) again on the ferry back to
Horseshoe Bay BC
this afternoon around

2:20pm
. There were at least 30. I think I count 19 in this pic alone.

T020 and T021 and the T002C's
were spotted by Ivan Reiff the
morning
in
Haro Srait
south-east of Discovery Island. T020 and T021 parted ways at approximately 1430 hours near Clover Point off Victoria. At approximately
1700
hours T020 and T021 were west bound near Race Rocks and the T002C's were hunting seals along the shoreline of Albert Head.
