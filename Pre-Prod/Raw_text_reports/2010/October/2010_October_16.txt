Orca Sightings for October 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit encountered
J's, K's and L's
spread out on the west side of
San Juan Island
heading south at

9:41 a.m.
(48째 30.77 N; 123째 09.69 W). They later turned around and came together in mixed groups. The whales were traveling north at a medium pace mid Haro Strait. The new L pod Calf, L116 was seen several times throughout the encounter and appears to be doing well. The encounter ended just off Mitchell Bay (48째 34.84 N; 123째 12.75 W) at
1:30 p.m. with the whales still heading north.

Around
6p
my wife and I observed 2 (possibly 3)
humpback whales
. They were traveling north from
Baynes Channel
. We saw them when they rounded 10-Mile Point, and observed them about 200 feet offshore traveling toward Johnson Reef, surfacing every 20 seconds. They were apparently in transit, not feeding. We have never previously seen humpbacks, but did see a head hump on one of them.

A co-worker reported to me while sailing just outside
Gig Harbor
this weekend they observed a "Bayliner" powerboat struck the
Minke Whale
that has been in the south sound recently. The whale was observed to surface twice after the incident. No other information was relayed to me.

Man you guys should have heard the
orcas
when they went by San Juan Island this morning - We saw 15 breaches in less than a minute off of
Bellevue Point
!!! Whales headed down island and then vocalized for over an hour at Lime Kiln - it was off the hook!
