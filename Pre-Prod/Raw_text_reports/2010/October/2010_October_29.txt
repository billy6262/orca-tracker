Orca Sightings for October 29, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was one of those special days in late October, when the clouds above gave way to periods of sunshine. A little warmth was welcomed as were sightings of
four Humpback Whales
south and west of
Victoria
, this afternoon at
1pm
. We saw a female, affectionately called 'Heather" by some of the skippers out of Victoria. This name has been coined due to the letter 'H' within her undertail/fluke markings and was traveling with her 2010 calf. They were taking long dives and traveling slowly west. Farther south we observed two others and Mark Malleson identified them as 4 yr olds that have visited these waters over the past few years. One was 'Split-Fin', with its dorsal fin somewhat chewed up, and the other, I called 'Split-Fluke' since it sported a tear to its right fluke, when observing its undertail markings. These familiar ' teens ' were in traveling mode too, taking long dives and several surface breathes. It is always so amazing to see these gentle-giants just off the Victoria water-front.
