Orca Sightings for October 13, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I chased the sunset to the west side of
San Juan Island
, and as I came out of the tree line there were
Orcas
! spread 1/8 of a mile off Land Bank property out into Haro Strait. From about

6:25pm to
6:55pm
a dozen? or more groups of killer whales swimming south with the ebbing tide, backlit by a salmon colored waning sunset reflecting in the low clouds and on the still water. Pectoral slaps, tail lobs, and breaches sounded off the water. I could identify J-26 Mike (my favorite teenage whale!), and J-1 Ruffles, when they slowed to forage a bit in a reef off of Hannah Heights. The amount of whales suggest some K's and/or L-Pod whales too.

After leaving the L's off Hannah Heights Center for Whale Research staff went north, just past
Kellett Bluff
and encountered
J's K's, and L's
spread out traveling south at

4:37 p.m
. (48° 36.123 N; 123° 13.011 W). We encountered
K13, K34, J19, J41, K14, K26, K36, K12, K43, K22, K37, J1, J2, L53, K40, K20, K38, L87, J31, J27, J28, J14, J46, J37, L2, J26, L88, J16, J22, J38, J36 and L78
. There were more whales present but they were very spread out across the strait and we did not see all of them. The encounter ended just off Mitchell Bay at sunset,
6:00 p.m. (48° 33.619N; 123° 11.845 W).

After receiving reports of whales off Eagle Point, Center for Whale Research staff Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Debbie Sharp departed Snug Harbor in Shachi. We encountered a
humpback
off the
San Juan County Park
at

1:54 p.m
. At

2:25
we encountered
L's
about 2 miles off Eagle Point (48° 26.659 N; 123° 03.157 W). There were also
two more humpbacks
in the area. The whales were spread out traveling south when we arrived on scene, and later came together in two tight groups.The first group we encountered was
L72, L90, L92, L95, and L 105
. That group later joined with
L83, L110, L54, L84, L100, L5, L26 and L108
. The next group we encountered was
L55, L103, L109, L86, L106, L112, L91, L27, L47, L115 and L82
with a new calf,
L116
. This is the first day that the new calf has been seen and is presumed to be less than a week old. The Encounter ended off Hannah Heights (48° 28.304 N; 123° 05.618 W) at

4:13
with the whales in two groups heading up island.

These two orcas (possibly Transients? ON) were sighted in
Sansum Narrows
, off Salt Spring Island B.C. about
11 AM
. They were traveling south. Maya and her friend Jason saw them - I didn't! They did get a video of them and they appeared active - rolling around each other, diving, and even spyhopping once. It was an awesome sight, and the young people loved hearing them breathe!

One of the
Humpbacks
was performing tail slaps, pec slaps, breaches for over half an hour! Never seen that kind of action before!! We had a Minke circle our boat a few times too - whales everywhere!!!

hydrophone since

This afternoon at

12:15 PM
I was at the Land Bank Preserve on the west side of
San Juan Island
. I was thrilled that from there I could see both
orcas
and
humpback whales
! There were Southern Residents milling off of Hannah Heights, and right in with them were two humpback whales. A third humpback was visible much further offshore just north of Beaumont Shoals. The orcas eventually headed south.
