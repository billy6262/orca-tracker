============================================================

Entry 1:
1656
: Lots of clear S01/02/16/19 and other
calls
on the
Orcasound

Heard a few clear
calls
around

14:21
on the
Orcasound
hydrophones. Beam Reach boat was moving with
SRKWs
off
Smallpox Bay
north at
11:56, south

12:08-
12:23, but is now taking shelter from 20kt winds and analyzing data. Just spoke with Jason who said they were with
J pod
around
noon
today and that the pod was headed north past
Kellett bluff
as they headed into analysis anchorage. Lot's of L pod calls now (

3:45 pm
) at
Lime Kiln
suggest they may be heading north, too. Not sure who made the
14:20ish calls at Orcasound.

2:20 pm
- North
Haro Strait
. How lucky we were this afternoon to have the [
orcas
] swimming in the most protected waters during today's little storm! A group of 4 or 5
Pacific White-sided Dolphins
made their way north approaching and swimming near and amongst several groupings of J pod and many of the various boats scattered along the two mile track of orcas and boats; like skipping children saying hi to everyone in the parade. We spent our time with
J1 and J2
and nearby, J14 and her 4 kids. So splendid!
