Orca Sightings for September 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Late
afternoon
my husband, Dick Snowberger, called from our boat to say he was watching a couple of transients about 50 yards off
Hidden Beach, Whidbey Island
. At
7.00 pm
from Tobys,
Coupeville
, we spotted a
large male orca
pass the end of Coupeville Wharf, some way out, heading into Penn Cove at a fair lick. A quick run to the end of the Wharf - three blows visible despite choppy seas and glare, the plumes of vapour an impressive sight.

9:25 am
- Saw
2 killer whales
, one larger with a very large crooked fin and a much smaller one, heading south from
Baby Island, Saratoga Passage
toward East Point a few hundred yards off the shore, about where all the crabs pots are usually laid. They were going slowly, doing some deep dives and resurfacing. Pretty cool!

10:10 am
- Just saw
a single killer whale
heading FROM East Point towards Baby Island, opposite direction of my previous post. This one had a very tall fin that looked like it had a bite or that some of the fin was missing from the back side of the fin, starting a little bit from the top and maybe 15% down the fin, in a very jagged fashion. He was swimming at a slow pace with lots of surfacing, and then did one long dive. I'm mid way between these 2 points and have lived here 4 years and have only seen killers one other time.
