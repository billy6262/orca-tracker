Orca Sightings for September 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
One picture is of a
humpback
we saw feeding today and it gave us a good look at its missing pectoral flipper. Looks like the whale is doing just fine without it. On our way in from the cruise, we came across some killer whales.
CA51s?
Kate Cummings, Sanctuary Cruises,
Moss Landing

Very interesting humpback whale image. How many killer did you see? 5? Off of Moss Landing? Yes - these are some of the
CA51s: CA51A, CA51A-1, and CA51B
.

A wonderful late afternoon [

] parade through
Active Pass
today around

5:15 pm
. They were heading east, moving quickly with only a few tail slaps and spy hops. At one point, there were about a dozen in a resting line, with their spoofs magnificently backlit.

From the 5 p.m. ferry going from Vancouver to Victoria, we saw around
15+ orcas
heading east past
Sturdies Bay
around

5:45 p.m.
. They were moving pretty fast, no other behaviors observed, but a nice way to come back to the Gulf Islands!

Another
