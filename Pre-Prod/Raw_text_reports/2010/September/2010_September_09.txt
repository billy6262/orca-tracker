Sighted
2 Orca
for sure, when they came back east I thought at one point there were 3. They were in
Hammersley Inlet
at approximately N 047 12.360 - W 123 1.66, traveling west at
9 AM
. East at
11AM
. On the way west they were surfacing a lot. On the way east, they sounded right about the listed location and did not surface again in sight (I can see east to about 47 11.943). There was some construction noises going on at Skookum point - loud miter saw. The inlet is only 1/4 mile wide, and they were on the side opposite of me - much deeper water. I have noticed several harbor seals around in the morning lately - there must be food in the area.

Today was our third day on the water off
San Juan Island
this trip. We spent some time with a variety of whales from
L pod
but unfortunately no scale samples, fecal samples, mucous samples or Dtag deployments. The highlight of the day was an encounter with a group of about
10 Pacific white-sided dolphins
off the west side of San Juan Island - we were able to get ID photos of a number of individuals for contribution to Erin Ashe's study of movements and abundance. Most of the time they were traveling, but they did wake ride on our research vessel briefly.

Here is
L89 "Solstice"
with lags (
Pacific White-sided dolphins
) surfing in front of him. At

15:00
some of the L pod males were very spread out near
Salmon Bank
and approx. 12-18 Pacific White-Sided Dolphins were swimming with them.

Haro Strait off San Juan Island - we watched a group (perhaps 10+) of
Pacific White-sided Dolphins
zoom up to and around one adult
L pod
male, over and over again! Great fun to watch this interaction.

Saw the
Pacific White-sided Dolphins
traveling east along the south end of
San Juan Island
. They were porpoising ahead of the research boat Phocoena. The orcas were spread out traveling west in the same area in several mid-sized groups. We thought that there was a brand new calf in the mix, but it was the L
47s with tiny little L115
. The calf was swimming strongly and keeping up well with the rest of the family, including participating in the feeding behaviors.

We had a visit from these charismatic creatures,
Pacific White-sided Dolphins
, this afternoon, south and east of
Discovery Island
. There seemed to be 10-12 of them heading east and riding our stern wave. What a thrill for everyone on board the
12.15 pm
Ocean Magic out of Victoria. They departed from us as soon as a Zodiac showed up and then it was 'chase the wake' of that vessel once again. I have only ever seen them in Johnstone Strait before so this was a pleasant surprise for me in this area. L Pod was off San Juan Island and we were heading that way and so were the dolphins.

2 killer whales
