Did anyone report the dozen, or perhaps more,
Orcas
that were salmon feeding

12:30
, in
Georgia Strait
, Canadian waters between BC Ferry Tsawwassen dock & Deltaport Way? (they have now!) There were no less than 5 commercial whale watching boats there to witness. It was very exciting. Thank you to the BC Ferry Captain who made the announcement so that anyone aboard could take in the experience. It was an amazing sight. Spread over a mile were many Orcas feeding. Three big males for sure. Spectacular in the sunlight.

Ken Balcomb reported S
outhern Resident orcas
were between Hannah Heights and South Beach,
San Juan Island
this
afternoon
.

All day there were no reports about the
J and K pod orcas
who were somewhere south of Whidbey Island in Puget Sound on this bright clear day. Finally they were seen from
Point No Point
in Admiralty Inlet at
3 pm
, heading north. At about

4:30
we found them between
Hood Canal and Marrowstone Island
, about two miles to the west, opposite Mutiny Bay on the west side of Admiralty. Their exhalations in a tight resting line were backlit by the autumn sun for at least a half hour, as they moved slowly northward. Eventually the line became a loose cluster of tall blows with occasional fins in the mist. For a while they continued north, then they all turned south, then the bunch turned north, then south, then north. We were getting dizzy and the evening winds got cold, so we left them, still miles away, still moving north, then south...we don't know which way they eventually went.
