Orca Sightings for September 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We arrived on scene in
Boundary Pass
and
J's and K's
were all together resting and then they all woke up with breaches and spyhops like crazy!

After receiving a report of
J's, K's and L's
heading southwest from
East Point
along with a pod of
Pacific white-sided dolphins
, Center for Whale Research staff Ken Balcomb, Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster, Barbara Todd and Stefan Jacobs departed Snug Harbor at
12:49 p.m. We encountered the
L22's and L12
in a tight group heading southwest in Boundary Pass at

1:19 p.m.
(48째 42.861 N; 123째 05.664 W). The whales were spread out in tight groups traveling slowly. The next group we encountered was the rest of the L12's and L54's, who were soon joined by the
L26's, L5 and L84
. We later encountered most of the
J's and K's
in a tight group. The encounter ended just off Turn Point with the
L47's L86's and L95
milling and moving south at

3:43 p.m
. (48째 41.356 N; 123째 14.410 W). The whales later turned and went up
Swanson Channel
.

This
afternoon
on the Western Prince we had an amazing encounter with members of
K and L Pods
just off of
Turn Point
around

3:30 PM
. We saw just about everything including breaches, spyhops, tail slaps, logging, foraging, great vocalizations both above and under the surface via the hydrophone, and even whales cruising in the wake of a freighter and K25 Scoter coming to the surface with a salmon in his mouth! I saw for sure the
L54s, L72s, L26s, K13s, as well as K40, K21, and L87
, but there were many more whales there, including some far in the distance that ended up going up Swanson Channel. It was a phenomenal day, and many more photos will be on my blog.

Pacific white-sided dolphins
joined a mix of
Southern Residents
, including Calypso (L94) and newly named calf Cousteau (L113) around
1.30 pm
in
Boundary Pass
. The whales were mostly traveling in tight groups with the occasional spyhop, breach or lob-tail. Passengers on 'Mystic Sea' gazed entranced as the whales moved with grace and purpose, the peaceful scene broken only by the sound of powerful exhalations carrying across the calm water and an excited little boy shouting, "I heard it squirt!" A magical day in the company of nature.

Today we headed up to
Turn Point on Stuart Island
just in time to see the [
orcas
] start coming around the corner from the Northeast. Many of them fanned out as they hit Haro Strait while a few hugged the shoreline, porpoising along the dramatic cliffs of Stuart Island. We observed many different behaviours including cartwheels, spy hops, foraging, logging, breaching, socializing, etc. Captian Hobbes put the hydrophone in the water and the vocals and echolocation clicks were phenomenal. We identified
L79, L41, L26, L92, L90, L72 and L105
in the first pass. L26 and offspring foraged below the cliffs before heading south. We then moved NW of Turn Point and enjoyed numerous encounters with Kpod. We saw
K40 and K21
, who did a nice breach . . . and then as a tanker passed many whales started to surf in it's stern wake. We saw many big fins with spray coming off the top of them, lots of speed and wow! what an experience. Whales continued to forage in the upwellings and tide rips. We saw many members of K-pod including
K37, K20, K26, K34
and just when you think it can't get any better (as John Boyd is telling everyone he has yet to get a picture of a whale with a fish in its mouth) K25 comes by the bow with a fish in its mouth. We could see his teeth!!!! A first for me after 13 years on the water! Monika Wieland was on board and got pictures. We did not confirm any sightings of Jpod, but understand that they were the whales we could see far to the north. We also saw lots of Harbor Seals, Bald Eagles and Harbor Porpoise on our way back to Friday Harbor.

- NW of

traveling S in Boundary Pass w/Beam Reach boat. They were off East Point of Saturna Island around noon.

All who witnessed this event were awestruck. From my vantage point, on the starboard bridge wing of the Alaska Ferry Columbia (height of eye 64' above the water), docked at Alaska Ship and Dry dock, Tongass Narrows where the channel width is 340 yards; I saw
Orca's
male and female, young and old, in groups of 5 to 15, stretched out over 1.5 miles, swimming (east to west) by us for 10-15 minutes. I believe a conservative estimate of
total count would be 75-100
.

Ketchikan, AK

Orca Network received two calls reporting a HUGE pod of
orcas
traveling north up
Tongass Narrows
, off
Ketchikan
Alaska in morning: First call from Scott Hendrickson, reporting
60 - 100 orcas
heading north up the Tongass Narrows a little after
7 am AK time
, passing by in dozens of groups spread out over a mile. Second report was from Mark Hutson, also a ferry crew member, who observed them pass by in about 20 groups of from 3 - 17 orcas in each group, some groups made up mainly of juveniles. They were spread out over a mile, took 30 minutes to pass by. He said in 35 years up there he has never seen anything like this - "it was shocking!". He said a large male brought up the end of the parade.

I'm on the M S Amsterdam heading south. Current position is N47 58 19.2 W125 16 55.6, 30 miles straight west of
LaPush, WA
. We see a small group of
Humpbacks
headed south.
Tom Allmendinger
When we look this location up on a map it looks like they are in Admiralty Inlet, but we have emailed Tom for more details on their exact location - ON

It is always a pleasure to see
humpback
whales. Today it was a mother and her calf foraging off
Sooke
, Vancouver Island BC.
