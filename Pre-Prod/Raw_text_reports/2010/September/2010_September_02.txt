Orca Sightings for September 2, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today was a great day out on Soundwatch. We had early morning reports of [
orcas
] near
Eagle Point
, so we knew we'd probably be busy as it is getting to be peak fishing season and the "last" weekend of summer vacation with the approach of Labor Day. At
1100
, we arrived on-scene and saw that
Ks and some Ls
were forming a long resting line. Having whales moving off-shore made it more manageable for approaching private vessels and giving them the guidelines. The whales continued in this resting pattern until after lunch, when they decided to head back towards shore and do some fishing. Where we had one large resting group in the morning, the
afternoon
had the whales spread over 3+ miles, which meant a lot more work keeping an eye on things. Again, most boaters were very cooperative and receptive to the guidelines. We left the whales at
1645
as they were heading back towards Hein Bank.

1:16 am
- Sounds like mostly
S19s
right now at L
ime Kiln hydrophones
- L-Pod?
Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Some calls were recorded just after Monika heard the S19 calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. There are some distant S5s and an S10, I think. It appears that
SRKWs
were recorded earlier at
Lime Kiln
(first at 23_38_20), and at
Orcasound
further to the north (first at 23_13_50), as well. So, perhaps they came in initially from the north.

11:54 pm: Calls
on
Lime Kiln
- kind of different. Later: I discovered that the calls I heard briefly at
11:54pm were
Transient
calls - there were some similar calls previously recorded on the OrcaSound link - this was my first time hearing this particular call!

Two Orca's
, 1 male and 1 female sighted off Whiskey Point at

Strait of Georgia
. The male did not seem particularly large from our vantage point. Approximate GPS coordinates are: N 50° 02', W 125° 13'.

Last
evening
around

6:30
heading north of
Greenbank Farm
, we spotted a pod of approximately
5 to 7 Orcas
including a young one and a large male. We observed the pod breaching.
