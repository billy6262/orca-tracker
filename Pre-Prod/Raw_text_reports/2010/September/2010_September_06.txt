Orca Sightings for September 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed to
False Bay
, and saw several
residents
including
J8, J30, L7, L53, L72, and L105
. They were spread out with some directional changes, tail lobbing from J30, and some surface splashing - possibly feeding. Next we headed to Whale Rocks and saw 4 Steller sea lions hauled out, growling at each other, and one in the water. We were going back up San Juan Channel and came across more porpoise, and then, the absolute cherry on top (report continued under "Pacific White-sided dolphins").

We were going back up
San Juan Channel
and came across more porpoise, and then, the absolute cherry on top -
Pacific white sided dolphins
!!! There were maybe a dozen or so, and as we turned to meet them they headed for our bow! Along side us was a mom and calf. They soon tired of our slow but respectful speed, and continued on their way south. Interesting to see them now, since transients have been sighted pretty consistently lately.

I was on board the Naiad with Mackay Whale Watching. We saw hundreds of
pacific white sided dolphins
and wonderful views of the
A30's (Northern Resident Orcas)
traveling together in
Johnstone Strait, N. Vancouver Island, B.C.

Reports of
J pod
were coming from the west side of
san juan
. Soon our guests were ooooing and ahhhhing over the tall wavy dorsal fin of
J1
(Ruffles). Other members of
J pod
were spread out nearby.

Orca Network received a call from someone reporting
4 orcas
, including 1 male and 1 calf, at

5:27 pm
at the top of
Holmes Harbor, near Greenbank
, Whidbey Island. They have watched them the past two or three days - they're fun to watch!
*
3 of us were pulling crab pots on the west side of
Holmes Harbor
about 1.5 miles from the boat launch at the south end. We observed a male and 2 females for about 20 min around
4PM
. The male is easy to ID from the transient library as #63 ("chain saw"?).

Kathy Bell called Orca Network at

12:45 pm
, reporting 1 bull and 2 female orcas in Penn Cove. The male had 2 notches out of the dorsal fin (sounds like T63, Chainsaw).
*
After Sandy's phone call, we headed to Coupeville - and learned that
Chainsaw
and gang were in
Penn Cove
again today - we saw them heading out by Monroe Landing, and they seemed to disappear, no sign of them after a good half hour of watching from Long Point (we arrived back home around
12:15 or so). Am pretty positive I saw 5 dorsals at one point. Then Sarah Schmidt took her spotting scope to Long Point and found them way over by Crescent Harbor (after we'd left). Sarah only confirmed seeing 3 dorsals.
Jill Hein, Coupeville preliminary ID on this orca is T19B - ON
