At
sunset

, (N
27:19, W1
77:01) the NOAA Ship Oscar Elton Sette came across a group of four killer whales. There were three adult female sized animals and one juvenile in the group. For tropical killer whales they were pretty tolerant of the big ship but as soon as we started to launch the small boat they vanished. Have fun,
