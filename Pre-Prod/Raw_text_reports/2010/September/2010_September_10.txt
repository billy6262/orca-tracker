Entry 1:
Large male

A glassy sea made for clear viewing of well spread out Southern Residents off the south side of
San Juan Island
around
1.30 pm
. Of particular interest (and mystery) was an
orca
'playing' with a Steller sea lion - little surface activity other than a waving pectoral fin followed by some turbulence in the water and a quick sight of the Steller's hind flippers disappearing. 'Mystic Sea' moved on but I wonder if anybody else saw anything? Straitwatch was in the area (thanks for being out there)

Starting 2 miles north of East Point on
Saturna Island
, we traveled southeast with members from
J, K and L pods. J8, K40, K21, L87, L84
and others. There were examples of all of the percussive behaviors and high-speed swimming before they reached the point and then they slowed down in the heavy waters between the buoy and the reef.

San Juan Island
: This morning we encountered
L72 and L105
carrying
a dead killer whale calf
off the west side of San Juan Island. We followed the whales for just
over 6 hours
, and most of the time the calf was not visible, but on occasion L72 would lift the calf out of the water when she was surfacing. When we were able to see the calf L72 appeared to either be pushing it in front of her balanced on her rostrum or would be carrying the calf on the top of her head, but the calf was negatively buoyant, so had probably not been dead for long. Although L105, L72's ~6 year old son, was within 50 or 100 m for most of the time, we did not see L105 interacting with the dead calf. Based on the size of the calf (approximately 6-7') we suspect it was near-term but no way to know whether it was stillborn or born alive and died shortly afterward. Upon surfacing L72 would frequently appear to 'drop' the calf and both whales would stop and dive deep to recover it. From the photos it appears the calf was a female, and the umbilical is still attached and clearly visible. When we left the whales early this evening L72 still had the calf with her.
