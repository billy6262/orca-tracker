Orca Sightings for September 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched
5 dolphins (Risso's, I assume?)
feeding in the surf from

15:30-
16:45, off West Cliff Drive in
Santa Cruz, CA
. The brown pelicans were nearby plunge diving so it must have been great fishing. There was lots of fluke slapping (we counted 10 slaps in a row from one) - I assume they were stunning the fish.

Orca Network received a call reporting
a pod of orcas

Mukilteo, Saratoga Passage
. They were first heading north, then were milling.

T18s

False Bay

We saw the
T18/19s
at
Turn Point (1700)
--they made one kill of a porpoise and followed up with their "endzone" dance of multiple breaches and spyhops!

I was sitting at Brooks Point on South Pender Island this evening (9/1) around
7-8pm
and watched a
HUGE pod of orcas
swim and jump and dive off the southern point of Saturna Island between
Saturna and Patos Islands
. They were spread out over most of the space between the islands, but were all over the place, so I'm assuming it's the super pod I just read about in the update email. I stayed until it got dark and they weren't really going anywhere, just hanging out it seemed.
