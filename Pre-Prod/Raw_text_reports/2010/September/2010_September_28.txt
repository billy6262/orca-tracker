Orca Sightings for September 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sept. 28 - Oct. 1 - Nancy Laymance called Orca Network about hearing
blows
in the night for
three nights in a row
, from Wednesday, Sept 28 to Friday, Oct 1, from the northern tip of
Harstene Island
. No actual whales were seen, but the description of the sounds indicates that there were several orcas there at night.
*
At
4:45 p.m. spotted a
Minke
in
Georgia Strait
, just off the Belle Chain Islets, near Saturna Island. We also observed lots of harbor seals on the islets and nearby water. It was a splendid afternoon, a lovely respite from all the fog and rain.

We started the whale watching portion of the trip at
Turn Point on Stuart Island
. Suddenly, whales started rounding Turn Point. Then more whales, then more!
Orca
after orca came toward the point, puffs of water vapor could be seen as distant whales headed our way and the orcas that passed by glistened in the sun. It was a super pod today, meaning all the whales from the Southern Resident community passed us by! Before seeing the whales we had seen harbor seals and bald eagles, after seeing the whales we saw MORE harbor seals, tons of wildlife on Spieden Island, a few
harbor porpoise
AND a
minke
whale!
