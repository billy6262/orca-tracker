Still
hearing orcas -
11:28 am
. Mostly S19s and S18s, so there are definitely some Ls still out there. Occasionally another call is thrown in, too. They are just starting to become less frequent now at

11:25 AM
. I spoke too soon - the calls are much more numerous again at

11:45 AM
. Now including S37s, S16s, S17s, S10s, and more.

10:53 am: Sounds
as if
L pod
is traveling north in
Haro Strait
. Very vocal and I got a few visuals of the whales from the Center's cam. Whales appear to be offshore. Airplane flying above. Hearing many S19's.
