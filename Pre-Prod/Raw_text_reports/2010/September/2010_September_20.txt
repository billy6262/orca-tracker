By the time we left Friday Harbor, the leaders were already passing quickly past
Lime Kiln
into the much smoother waters by
Henry Island
. Once again, as is proving this fall, it was a very mellow day with few boats, calming waters, and sunny skies. The whales were spread in small groups ranging from 2-10 whales per group. But they were still very active, and were spending more time than normal hanging around the surface. We had
J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, the J17s, J28 Polaris and her calf Star, L87, K25
and more. We watched as the whales once again zig-zagged in and out of currents. As we were approaching Stuart Island, we made a detour as we came across about
12 Dall's Porpoises
-- my first sighting for 2010!!! They were definitely bow riders, and even decided to bow ride a few orcas as well!

Captain Craig started to receive reports of whales on the west side of
San Juan
heading north. We passed
Henry Island
and started to see whales spread out around the north end of San Juan.
J1 "Ruffles"
was traveling close to shore with a few other members of the
J pod
. We identified J16 "Slick" and J30 "Riptide". Riptide is a "sprouter" male born in 1995. "Sprouter" is the term we use for juvenile males as they mature and their dorsal fin becomes taller and pointier. Riptide's handsome dorsal fin appears to be getter larger every time I see him.

1909
- The
L2s
have been near
Lime Kiln
for the last couple hours foraging anywhere from 1/2 mile north about 1/2 mile offshore and last seen going down island, south of the light about 1/2 hour ago. I believe that is still them on the Lime Kiln Hydrophones now.

1545
- Just heard a few faint
S17s
on L
ime Kiln hydrophone
, though most callers seem to have moved north of Orcasound (see Beam Reach boat track here). Perhaps there are a few K pod stragglers still going north?

They're on orcasound now, and the background is much quieter, just some mysterious knocking noises (echolocation) and burbling water.
