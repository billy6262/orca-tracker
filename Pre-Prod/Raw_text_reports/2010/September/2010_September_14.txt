Orca Sightings for September 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Residents are back!! Nice to see them back after three days of searching for Transients. Mostly
J's
and
K's
today and had a couple
L's
traveling north with them in
Swanson Channel
. They were traveling in tight groups and the old timers in J pod (
J1, J2, and J8
) were traveling in a group with L7. Just as we were about to leave, we had two big breaches from
J1
and a spyhop from J2.

After watching groups of
K's
pass the Center for Whale Research, NW San Juan Island, Center staff departed Snug Harbor and encountered the whales just off
Kellett Bluff
at

11:07 a.m.
(48째 34.947 N; 123째 12.093 W). The whales were spread out in tight groups. We first came across
K22 and K33
traveling close to shore on Henry Island. They later joined up with
K12, K37
and
K43
. We caught up with the K13's just before Stuart Island where we were turned around by thick fog. Encounter ended at

12:03 p.m
. (48째 38.932 N; 123째 13.343 W).

WhoListener program auto-detected
SRKW calls
first at

09:29
, then continuously until
9:41. Since then, there have been autodetections at
Lime Kiln
bracketing Suzy's detection (first was at
9:33, they are continuing now). So they may be traveling southward with some individuals as far north as S tip of
Henry Island
(where Beam Reach boat is collecting first fall data with towed hydrophone array).

Just had a call from Barb, down at Whiskey Creek Beach (
Strait of Juan de Fuca
) she is watching a
gray whale
travel east just outside the kelp, as the light dims. This is her first gray whale sighting since April, and she has been camped at the beach this whole time. Only a couple reports from Crescent Bay [Salt Creek] this whole spring/summer. Same lack of gray whale sightings from Low Point and Twin Rivers.
