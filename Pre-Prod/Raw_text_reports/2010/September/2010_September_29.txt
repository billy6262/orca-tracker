Orca Sightings for September 29, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was another great encounter with some of
L Pod
, off
False Bay, San Juan Island
. It is always great to see the Southern Residents any time, especially the L's including the newest member, L115. They were coming up from the south and heading north. With the added bonus of plenty of sunshine and great looks at L 47 and her little calf, those of us on board the ' Pacific Explorer ' at
2pm
, would agree we had a 'whale of a time'. The little calf appeared to be so active with behaviours of spyhops, tail lobs and chasing of fish. (look for Marie's photo of L 115 with its mom in a future report! ) We even saw a few Dall's Porpoise interacting with the Orca. There is nothing nicer than being in the company of Orca in my opinion, especially mom's with their little ones.

Saw four
Orcas
at
Lagoon Point
(48 04' 22.33" 122 36' 52.00") at about

1:00 PM
. They circled in the rip for about 30 minutes and appeared to be feeding, but I'm not sure. The slapped the water frequently with their tails. I wasn't able to determine if any were males and didn't see where they went. I haven't seen whales there in the past.

Pete Bingham called from Hansville at

5:58
to say
orcas
were passing
Point No Point
, Kitsap Peninsula, headed south.
*
At

12:40
Roger Clark called from his fishing boat to report about
a dozen orcas
traveling south off
Lagoon Point
, Whidbey Island, in Admiralty Inlet. He said there were at least two large males. I joined him at

1:30
and for the next 2 hours we moved only a mile or so. The whales, including
J1, J2, J28 and calf, J34 and K40
, were breaching, lobtailing and U-turning rapidly, indicating foraging. Roger said coho were running, though Chinook may have been among them. I then went by land to Bush Point, about 2 miles south, and waited another 20 minutes before the first ones came by in mid-channel. They took another hour till

4:20
to pass
Bush Point
, very slowly and very spread out.

Jennifer Hagerman called at

5:28pm
to say she was watching
orcas
headed south past
Mutiny Bay
, Whidbey Island.
*
1637
:
orca
, 2 maybe 3 groups, headed south fast in the shipping lanes. Probably at about the north end of
mutiny bay
now. I am just south of bush point and they are south of me and going fast.

I had the great fortune to be on the beach just north of
Mutiny Bay
this afternoon about
4 o'clock
and saw many plumes in the distance. I guess maybe about a dozen
Orcas
spread out across Admiralty Passage were headed south towards Seattle at a leisurely pace. There were some breaches also, but they were pretty far from shore and i didn't have binoculars, so i couldn't really see much but the big splashes and some dorsal fins. But it made my day!

1525 SRs
- S19 and S5 calls on both
Lime Kiln and Orcasound hydrophones
now. Probably heading north. Also, Orca Network detected southern residents going south into Puget Sound passing Lagoon Point on Whidbey Island at 2pm, so listen today on Port Townsend and Seattle Aquarium, as well!

Scott called from
Bush Pt.
at

3:51
to report about ten
orcas
headed south past Bush Point, Whidbey Island.
*

3:40 pm
: Bev Wenthin - pod of
orcas
off
Bush Pt
, mid-channel, just North of the buoy.
*
We were watching the [
orcas
] out front at
Lagoon Point
today beginning around

1:30
, breaching, playing and staying in the same area, they are still out there at

2:14
. My neighbor said that is where they were catching fish this morning so maybe that is what they are doing.

So exciting to see the pod of
orcas
passing
Lagoon Pt
. about

1:15
. Several males, I thought I saw at least 3, also some small one with them. I actually saw a small one trying to do tail lobs. Lots of breaches and spy hopping. The first group had about 5 and the second, maybe 10. I will be looking for your report. I wonder if they are feeding as they seemed to be hanging out in one area for a while as they slowly move Southward.

1:00 PM
- There are two
pods
playing - full breaches - quite a show. One pod seems to be staying directly across from
Lagoon Point
, the other is headed South.

Ken Balcomb relayed a text message from Ron Bates about
15 orcas
off the south side of
San Juan Island
.
*
Ken and Wendy Eklund called Orca Network to report a
single orca
north of Olympic Shoal in
Budd Inlet
at

5:45
. They said they saw a black fin about 3 1/2 feet tall and heard the blows. It was headed SSW.
