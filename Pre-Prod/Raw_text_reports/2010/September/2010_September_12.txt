And some ID's on the California Transients in the above report and photo from Alisa Schulman-Janiger: Nice pics! These are the
CA51s: CA51, CA51A, CA51A-1 (juvenile), CA51B (sprouted male), and CA51C.
They frequent Moss Landing, but have also been seen down my way, off Los Angeles and Dana Point, CA.

Here is an image from our wonderful encounter with
4 Humpback Whales
off
Victoria
including a Mother and very very active calf! We were only a few miles south of Victoria this afternoon, when came across 2 Humpback Whales, one of which was "Spli t Fin", a Humpback Whale that has visited the area for at least 3-4 years now. We watched these two Humpback Whales for a while and saw several tail flukes as they made deep dives. Then we headed a little further south and came across the Mother and Calf. Not long after we arrived on scene the young Calf made an amazing cartwheel just over 100 yds from our boat much to the delight of our passengers and crew!

We spent a little time with two
humpbacks
on Sunday, about 1.5 miles E of the Victor Gulf buoy in the St
rait of Juan deFuca
. One had a deep notch in its dorsal fin, but we didn't get a good enough look at the flukes to try to get an ID. Also saw a
minke
outside of
Cattle Pass
about noon, and another off Partridge Point around

5:30 pm
. Also, at Whale Rocks in Cattle Pass we spotted a branded Steller's Sea Lion hauled out with about a dozen others. Thanks to your very helpful page on the subject, I learned that this particular sea lion was branded at Rogue Reef in 2003 (#183R). Among the Steller's there at the time was another one with some kind of wound or growth around his left eye; didn't seem to be bothering him but still didn't look so good.
