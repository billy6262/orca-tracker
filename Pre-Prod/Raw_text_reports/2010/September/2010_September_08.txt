Orca Sightings for September 8, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
ID's from Alisa Schulman-Janiger of
California Transients
reported and photographed in Monterey Bay by Kate Cummings: In the first group you had N28, N28A, and N28B (Jagged Fin). The second group included N29 (Chopfin/Stumpy), CA50 (female), and CA50B (nearly sprouted male).

2 orcas
, an exceedingly large orca with a large fin, and a small one, sighted in
Pickering Passage, South Puget Sound
, going past Jarrell's Cove State Park,

2:30 pm
.

The first group we saw includes Jagged Fin -- a whale we saw in January. The second group of photos is from the whales we encountered a half hour later in relatively the same vicinity, and this pod included Stumpy/Chopfin, a new male, and Jagged Fin was gone. Not sure what went on here! They were all heading south at 12 knots. There were sea lions and Pacific white sided dolphins in the area but they weren't interested.

calls
@
Orcasound
and my daughter took a few pictures with the Orcacam. They were heading south and heard them on the
LimeKiln hydrophone
for the past 30mins.

Whales (
Orcas
) passed by the
Center for Whale Research
about 10 minutes ago (

4:42 pm
).

A breaching
killer whale
(Lpod?) in front of
Victoria
. Photo was taken around
5 pm
. The animals grouped up and were speed porpoising towards San Juan Island. It was a sight to behold!

We saw members of
J pod
on the south end of San Juan near
Salmon Bank
. Once again we identified
J26
"Mike". Then, we saw more whales, possibly members of
L pod
, along the west side of San Juan around
Eagle Point
. The whales were widely spread out in all directions, traveling in groups of about 5-10. Every day is different and today we got a little taste of everything. We saw spyhopping, porpoising, breaching, and tail lobbing. The best part is that they are in their wild habitat.

Both Center for Whale Research vessels encountered
J's and a few K's and L's
spread out off
Salmon Bank
at

2:12 p.m
. (48째 25.564,123째 01.031 W). The whales were spread out in mixed groups, milling and socializing. Both vessels were coordinating with the zeppelin "Eureka" to conduct aerial surveys of the southern residents (see reports and below on this research project). The encounter ended just off
Lime Kiln State Park
at

4:08 p.m
. (48째 31.149 N, 123째 09.873 W) The whales continued north up the west side.

Airship "Eureka" Research Project - report from Brad Hanson, NOAA Fisheries - San Juan Islands: Follows is short summary of our overflight of
southern resident killer whales
on the Farmer's Airship Eureka that is owned and operated by Airship Ventures. Farmer's Insurance generously donated 2 days of aircraft time on the zeppelin to allow the NWFSC, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the
Center for Whale Research
to collect various types of imagery from this unique perspective. Inclement weather on 7 Sept for most of the day resulted in the flight being scrubbed. Although the weather on the 8th constrained our flight on both ends of the day we did get
about an hour with the whales
- while this did allow us to get some good imagery on the different systems the sample size was small but likely enough to illustrate proof of concept and give us an idea of what types of modifications would improve our ability to collect these types of data operationally. Included is an image of a whale suitable for photogrametrics collected by Erin Heydenreich. It will probably be at least a couple of months before WHOI has had an opportunity to process the video imagery. What was particularly amazing to me was how well this platform allowed observation of various whale behaviors. Because we could essentially remain virtually stationary we could see several whale groups simultaneously as well as see down into the water column, I observed what appeared to be a fish chase, defecation, and possible nursing - all within an hour! We are extremely grateful to Airship Ventures for their commitment to making this project happen, particularly under challenging weather conditions, and to Farmer's Insurance for their financial support for the flight time. It was an amazing opportunity.

Airship "Eureka" Research Project - San Juan Islands: The Airship "Eureka", which has been on a tour of the Pacific Northwest since mid August, took a flight over
Haro Strait
. Eureka, one of the largest zeppelins in the world, is operated by Airship Ventures based in California. Farmers Insurance donated two days of flight time to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in collaboration with North West Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and the Center for Whale Research (CWR). The purpose of the mission was to get aerial photographs of southern resident killer whales for photogrammetry studies as well as to examine vessel-whale distribution. In 2008 the Center for Whale Research participated in an initial photogrammetric study of southern residents using a helicopter as the aerial photography platform (see Encounter 49). In addition to collecting updated measurements, this mission served as a opportunity to test out an alternative aerial platform for similar studies in the future. Measurements taken from aerial photographs can be used to look at individual growth, body condition and nutritional status. Due to weather constraints the 2 day mission was reduced to a half day mission which took place on Wednesday. Eureka departed Paine Field in Everett Washington at
1:55 p.m. Among those on board were Brad Hanson of NMFS, and Erin Heydenreich of CWR. Approximately an hour later the airship arrived at the south end of San Juan Island where resident killer whales were reported off the
Salmon Bank
buoy. The airship was coordinating with both Center vessels, Orca and Shachi, as well as the NOAA vessel, Phocina 2, to identify the individual whales being photographed from above. The airship hovered around False Bay for about 45 minutes to an hour before turning north east to pass over Roche Harbor and then headed back to Paine Field where it landed at

6:00 p.m
. For more photos of the trip go to the Airship Adventures Blogspot The whales observed were
J's, K's and L's
. They were spread out in mixed social groups. Many whales were milling off False Bay. The whales reportedly went north later that evening.
