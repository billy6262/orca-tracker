Watched a large pod of
Orcas
swim by
East Point on Saturna Island
around
noon
. They came from up north or northwest and swam right around the point, then west out in the Straight of Georgia. We think there were about 25 Orcas in total. We saw several calves. Parts of the pod came very close to the shore, around 10 meters from it. Maybe around 10-15 orcas were this close, the rest of the pod were much further out, surrounded by whale watching boats. The currents are very strong right there, so they traveled slowly. We saw them breach, spyhop, do fluke lifts, pectoral slaps and waves and rolling.

7:30 AM until
10:00 AM
.
