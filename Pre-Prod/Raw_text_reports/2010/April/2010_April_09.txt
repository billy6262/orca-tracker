Entry 1:
Wanted to report a Gray Whale who has been visiting/feeding. 1st Visit was appx

11:30AM - 6PM
near the West Beach of
Sinclair Inlet
here in Bremerton. We saw a lot of sprays and just a few times the whale showed it's back as it crested the surface. The whale traveled South appx 3/4 miles and back. Repeated this behavior all afternoon.

I live on
Bainbridge Island
right on Puget Sound off Gertie Johnson Road. I live in Rollingbay (across Puget Sound from Ballard). Yesterday at dusk,
a gray whale
went by in quite shallow water at an extremely leisurely pace probably eating fish. It was about 100-150 ft off shore and had white scars on it.

I saw
a Grey Whale
in
Crescent Harbor
(near Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) again today at about

3:20 PM
. He was feeding and QUITE close to shore. My girls and I walked down on the beach and got to see a fin and his tail come up out of the water many times. We actually meandered down the beach with him for a few minutes. The folks who pointed the whale out to us indicated that they had seen him yesterday as well. And on a walk down to the beach on Monday afternoon I saw a whale spout several times. It seems as though one may be returning each day to feed or kind of 'camped out' down there.

At about

2:45pm
we saw a spout just off the beach at
Cama Beach
on Camano Island. We saw it again a few times, it was heading north. The last time we saw it we could just make out the flukes as it headed down. Probably
a grey whale
, but we were too far off to see for sure.

I was just getting home (NW
Langley
) when I saw
two gray whales
feeding in the shallow water just north of Langley. By the time I got my camera they were headed off in the direction of Camano Point. One of the whales looks like #531. At

7:30 PM
I spotted
a gray whale
south of
Langley
traveling to the southeast. It was in the deep water. This morning at

6:15 AM
a gray whale came by NW Langley in the deeper water right off of the drop off. It is headed in your direction, to the northwest. For the time that I watched it, it was not feeding, just swimming along.
