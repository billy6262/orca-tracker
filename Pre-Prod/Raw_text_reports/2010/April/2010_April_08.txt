Orca Sightings for April 8, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Barbara Anderson called Orca Network to report
2 gray whales
in
Saratoga passage
near Pebble Beach, south Camano Island, about a half mile from shore. They were traveling north.
*
At

6:15 PM
I watched the blows of
one or two gray whales
swimming near
Camano Island
opposite Langley and traveling to the northwest.

Jim Somers called Orca Network from the
Whidbey Naval Air Station Exchange
Lot where he was in his car watching
a gray whale
rolling in shallow water about 50 feet from shore.
*
A whale was sighted around
3 pm
, heading west, in
Penn Cove
, on Whidbey Island. It may have been
a gray whale
, and was definitely not an orca. The cove was extremely choppy, due to high winds, but the whale was easy to see, because of its size. It was a lone whale, fairly close to the shore, swimming against the current, heading west, until it apparently reached the end of the cove. We then observed it heading east, back out of Penn Cove.
