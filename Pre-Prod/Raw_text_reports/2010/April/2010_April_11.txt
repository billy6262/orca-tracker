Orca Sightings for April 11, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I took some friends out and came across these
orcas
. There appeared to be 2 large males and 6 females and juveniles. We were in Stephens Passage south of
Juneau
when they cruised past us.

Last Sunday three friends of ours saw a
spout of mist 15' high
while sitting along the northern shore of
Quartermaster Harbor
at Portage. They estimated the location to be just north and east of the Burton Peninsula and closer to Maury Island than to Vashon proper (so just inside inner Quatermaster Harbor). They saw only the one plume but guessed that the whale was heading south. No binoculars. We rendezvoused with them at Dockton park. Approximately 30 minutes after the first sighting, the five of us saw a single tall spout/plume emerge from just south and east of the Burton Peninsula, about equidistant between the peninsula and Maury. The plume was approximately 15 feet tall. No further sightings were observed. Conditions were sunny and somewhat windy. Can't help but wonder if this was the Arroyo Beach whale.

One, very small
Gray Whale
(estimated about 20 ft).
Sinclair Inlet
by Right Creek (west of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard)from

6:50 to
7:15pm
. Visible from freeway. It appeared to be circling, but would have needed to be traveling out as the other way toward Gorst is a dead end. It appeared to be feeding, but I'm not sure exactly. It was diving and spouting often. My family has lived in this area for about 20 years and have never seen any whales in the area, it was very strange. As I've heard, usually they only appear here when sick or abandoned. Something else to note is that the area it swam in was known to be fairly shallow, the whale area past the shipyard toward Gorst at deepest is about 30 feet.

I saw
a Grey whale
just off
Bremerton Navy ship yard
. I clearly saw it as broke the surface 3 times breathing each time at maybe 2-3 minute intervals. It was heading away from the ship yard toward the inlet.

Around
230 pm
we (Greg Sivertsen, Eric Rogers, and I) spotted two spouts within 40 yards of Lovejoy Point in
Penn Cove
while paddling our surfskis. The
[gray] whales
were within 100 ft of two female kayakers. We were about 300 yards away and approaching from Long Point. We paddled our surf skis quickly toward the last spotting but did not see any more activity. We spoke to the two female kayakers and they were very excited as one of them had a gray surface within 20 feet of her boat! Based on your reports, it seems the two grays probably went right under us and back around to feed later in the day at Snakelum Point.

12:30 PM
. Spotted
a grey whale
surfacing about 150 yds. from the boat launch on Monroe Landing. Was sitting on my deck putting my shoes on to go play tennis and got "delayed". We saw it several more times heading West towards the end of
Penn Cove
where we saw a grey whale a couple weeks ago. Lost sight of it I think near the mussel rafts. Still to see the whales at my work place but jealous of the many sighting at Seaplane base last week ! Our harbormaster took some great shots and I got them forwarded to me. I will try to attach them. They were taken last week near the Navy Marina in Crescent Harbor (see above photo).

About

12:30 p.m.
, my first spotting was a weak blow at the northern tip of Cooper Point (
Olympia, WA
). The
[gray] whale
then did a very slow surfacing series heading north toward Harstene Island/Squaxin Island. It then turned around and headed back toward the south - but I lost track of it about halfway between the islands and the tip of Cooper Point. It never surfaced much - only slightly cresting the water. I have not seen it since, but keep looking. I have a few far-away photos that show the spine, but they aren't very good - because it was too far away. I sent them to Cascadia Research.

We left the (
Transient orca
) whales about
1845
mid-Saratoga Passage - they were in the middle of preying on a harbor seal - this was at least the second one since you got us on them a little after 1400 - we observed the first harbor seal predation just before they headed into Penn Cove. Then they split up in Penn Cove for a while with one sub-group killing something small - we collected tissue fragments and will have to run the genetics. Not surprisingly, it was the same group seen on Saturday:
T87, T88, T90,T90B, T124, T124E, and T124D
.

We received good news that one of the Whale Watch boats had spotted
Patch
off
S. Gedney Island
with
3 other Gray whales
, and he seemed to be ok!.
*
I was out there watching the transients on Island Explorer 3. We picked up the
orcas
at about

11:30
- just south of the
Clinton ferry dock
. There were two groups - one consisting of six or so whales (including a youngster); the second "group" was a large male (T87, we think) and at least one smaller whale. T87 and friends lagged a half-mile or so behind the other group. We left the orcas just north of Camano head - - right before they encountered Patch. We heard about the encounter and tried to zip back up there, but didn't make it in time to see any action - or even to see Patch. On our way back to the marina, we did find
another gray whale
mid-way between the south end of Hat Island and the entrance to the jetty. He was feeding in about 20 feet of water. He surfaced a number of times, but never showed us his full fluke.

Here are photos of some of the
transient Orcas
about 20 minutes before they attacked Patch the
Gray whale
! Orcas were traveling North in 3 groups with the largest group about 5-7 including a very small/young Orca. T87 was hanging back with 1-2 smaller Orcas and the larger group was way ahead of him. I was on the Island Adventures tour. Our tour turned South to look for Grays away from the transients when we got a call that the attack was happening further north.

I was aboard the Mystic Sea and witnessed the
Orca attack
on the
gray
. My observation was that it was a planned attack and that the Orcas had no intention of eating the gray. It seemed more like a human-style gang "mugging" than any type of self preservation behavior.

About

6:15PM;
we noticed a stationary boat [NOAA?} out aways, at the entrance of
Penn Cove
[between Snakelum and Polnell Points]. As, we got closer, saw spouts. ORCAS, 2, THEN 3, THEN MORE. Counted
7 orcas
in all and it certainly seemed, they were feeding. Two females, would always come up together. Large male would always surface with another smaller orca by its side and were usually away/separate from the other 5 orcas. No breaching, but, several hard side rolling splashes. Along, with a few tail splashings. Watched for 30 minutes until

6:45PM
, then, it seemed like everyone/thing; knew party was over. At same time, as, NOAA and we were readying to leave, so were the orcas. On the move, headed toward, Naval base in Crescent Harbor. No sign of the Snakelum gray, as reported. But, then, again, was preoccupied with the activity of the orcas.

At
1.15pm
the Prince of Whales 'Ocean Magic' caught up with
T14
, affectionately known as Pender. I just love seeing this big Transient Bull which seems to be on a regular basis through out the year. He was seen traveling slowly just off shore of Vancouver Island, around the
Sooke
area. He looked as though he was searching for prey but we never saw any behaviours that indicated he was consuming anything. We left him heading west. Apparently he had been seen the day before in the company of T87 and other Transients in USA waters. I guess, eventually he likes his own company, so wanders off !

I got a call early in the morning that there were Orcas over in
Rosario Strait
, near Bird Rocks. (Bird Rocks are a group of rocks in the middle of Rosario, a mile or so south of the ferry route. They often have sea lions hauled out and always seals.) We finally got there about
noon
to find
six transient Orcas
attacking a sea lion. They spent the whole day in the same spot. Lots of gulls feeding on the leftovers, with a resplendent Mt. Baker in the background. Today is gorgeous, and there were Orcas near Whidbey and west of Victoria, but no passengers, so I went fishing.

This morning we received a report of a
lone Male Orca
being sighted near
Constance Bank
at
8.30am
. By the time a boat caught up with the orca it had traveled west to Race Passage. Not long after the first boat arrived on scene it was confirmed the Orca was
T14 "Pender"
, who had last been seen yesterday in Rosario Strait. We continued to track T14's progress as he slowly made his way West throughout the day. By the time we headed out on Fastcat for a 2pm tour, Pender had traveled almost to
Sooke
. Just as we were nearing Sooke we discovered T14 had suddenly tracked south deeper into the Strait of Juan De Fuca and it was soon apparent why as we started to see multiple blows! We wondered at first if it was J-pod but it turned to be over
15 Transient Orcas
including the T100's) The Orcas were traveling close together at 8 kts towards Race Rocks. We finally left them just south of race Rocks still traveling East.

The afternoon tour today started out just to the Southwest of Secretary Island (just offshore of Sooke Harbour) with
T-14 (Pender)
on his own traveling West at about 5.5 kts. We followed 'The Big Guy' for over 35 minutes until we were almost in line with
Otter Pt
. For the entire time we were with Pender, he had been traveling in a straight line with very consistent surfacings, when suddenly, he did a hard left and increased his speed to over 9 kts. Based on this change in behaviour, I thought that maybe he was chasing his dinner or something.... However, it turned out that he was trying to catch up with a large group of Orcas (15-20 animals) which were Eastbound towards Race Rocks at a high rate of speed. Preliminary ID's included the T-100's with baby, T-30's, T-102, and possibly T-103 along with a few others that were not identified. Great job Val and Danny for spotting these animals way to the South of our location !!!! Nice work guys :) Once Pender caught up to this large group, all animals continued East towards Race Rocks. Our encounter ended at
1630
hrs. 1nm West of
Race Rocks
Lighthouse.

Jill Hein of Coupeville called at

6:15 pm
to report the
Transient orcas
were off
Polnell Shores
, east of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island. She saw at least 6 of them, circling and tail slapping right off the NOAA boat!
*
Sarah Schmidt of
Coupeville
, Whidbey Island, called to report that while watching a
Gray whale
(#44 - see report below) off Snakelum Point, they spotted the
Transient orcas
at

5:05 pm
heading north in N. Saratoga Passage, going past the N. end of Camano Island, the NOAA boat still with them. Then at
5:08 pm the orcas had turned around, and headed back toward the entrance to
Penn Cove
, passing Polnell Pt. heading SW. By
5:20 pm, the orcas were off Maylor Pt, still heading toward Penn Cove, and Gray whale #44 was still feeding off Snakelum Point, just across the cove from the Transients. She called back at
6:20 pm - the Transients went almost into Oak Harbor, then were off Polnell Pt., about 1 mile away from the Gray whale off Snakelum Pt.
*
At around

3:15 pm
Howard spotted the
Transient orcas
in
Saratoga Passage
, between Cama Beach on SW Camano Island and Greenbank on Whidbey Island. They were milling, then heading north. Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries was arriving on scene to do some research and get ID photos.

Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called at around
1 pm
to report a pod of
~7 Transient orcas
in Saratoga Passage, mid-channel off
Langley
. The pod included the male T87. They were off Sandy Pt, and heading N/NW toward a Gray whale. He called back a bit later to report that
several of the female Transient orcas had rammed the Gray whale hard
, rolling it up out of the water and onto its back. It lay there awhile, then rolled over and was swimming again, but listing at a 10 - 15 degree angle. By

1:20 pm
, the Transients had left the gray whale and continued NW up Saratoga Passage, and the Gray whale had turned toward the beach at Langley. Passengers on the boat shot some photos and video, which will be broadcast on KING 5 TV News tonight.
*
At
1 pm
Noelle Goforth called to report seeing several
orcas
just SE of
Langley
, near Sandy Pt.
*
About
1 PM
today, I was watching a whale watch boat just a little north of
Langley
, I think it was the Mystic Sea. I was watching through the binocs as they were quite close to a spouting
gray
. All of a sudden, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving fast. I thought is was a power boat, but then I twice thought I saw a tall, male orca fin roll twice, then it was gone. I wasn't sure what I had seen, and was hoping the Mystic Sea would report on the encounter. Sounds like it may have been the encounter you just mentioned.

Veronica von Allworden called at

12:35 pm
to report
orcas
off Camano Head, S.
Camano Island
, heading N/NW. At

12:45
, they were along SW Camano Island, and seemed to be continuing N.
*
Janet Mitchell on Camano Island called to report a pod of
orcas
out from Pebble Beach, SW
Camano
at

12:30 pm
.
*
We received a call from Larry on S. Whidbey Island at

10:40 am
, reporting a pod of
orcas
including 1 adult male and 5 females, heading N. in
Possession Sound
, ~1 - 2 miles south of the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry run, mid-passage. At 11 am, it looked like they were off East Pt. on Hat/Gedney Island.
*
Fred Lundahl of Langley called around
6 pm
- he had been flying over Saratoga Passage, and reported seeing
Gray whale #22
feeding about 100' offshore of downtown
Langley
, in front of the Dog House, and another 2 gray whales off the S. point of the entrance to Penn Cove.
*
Veronica von Allworden called to report
Gray whale #22
off
Langley
, Whidbey Island heading SE in Saratoga Passage at

5:40 pm
.
*
Sarah Schmidt of Coupeville called to report
a Gray whale
off Snakelum Pt, Whidbey Island, off the entrance to
Penn Cove
, moving back and forth, feeding at
4 pm
. She described three small white spots on its left fluke, which sounds like it could be whale #44. Unfortunately the Transient orcas are heading in that direction right now as well.
*
3 grays
are on their way from Bells Beach to
Langley
now (

3:45 pm
). Earlier this morning: This Gray whale should be in Langley by now (

9:30 am
). taken 30min ago (9 am) at bells beach (SE Whidbey).

My husband saw a
large grey whale
just off our beach on SE
Penn Cove
at

2:35pm
. We are on the southern city limits of
Coupeville
. First my husband heard the puffing sound and then saw the big grey whale roll out of the water as it was spouting. I saw and heard it the second time. It was traveling south toward Long Point and was close to shore.

Veronica von Allworden of Langley called - she had just taken a flight over Saratoga Passage, and saw
3 Gray whales
at
1 pm
off
East Pt
, near the entrance to Holmes Harbor, actively feeding. She also saw
Patch
between
Langley
and Bells Beach, in shallow water by a B&B on Saratoga Rd, near where the Mystic sea reported the gray whale that had been attacked by the Transient orcas had last been seen. Patch was surfacing to breathe, but not feeding. When she flew by again 15 minutes later he was gone. Later, she wrote: We found Patch (49) in shallow water half way between Langley and Bells Beach at about

12:50 pm
. He was not feeding just laying on the bottom and then coming up for a breath. Fifteen minutes later he was no longer there. I hope that is a sign that he is going to be alright! At
1:10 we circled 2 aggressively feeding
gray whales
in the shallows off of
Fox Spit
. They had headed off by
1:20. We did not see which way they went. We did not see the orcas that had been around earlier.

Around
noon
, my husband reported seeing
a gray whale
between the docks at Quartermaster Yacht Club in inner
Quartermaster Harbor
, where it is very shallow, about 12 feet! I ran down to the Club and saw it spout across the harbor, and about a half hour later it spouted and surfaced just south of Jensen Point. I saw it 2 more times on the east side of Quartermaster Harbor just north of Dockton, again presumably feeding in shallow water near the shore.

Jan Mezich and I were paddling in
Penn Cove
on this lovely
afternoon
when we spotted the spouts of at least
two, perhaps three, gray whales
. One was moving toward us so we just floated quietly. Eventually one surfaced and blew less than 20 feet in front of my kayak and probably swam under my boat. What a thrill.
Phyllis Kind, Whidbey Island
