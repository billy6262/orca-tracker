Orca Sightings for April 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

8:00 AM
, saw a large spout way out in the shipping lanes from the beach at
Point No Point
(N. Kitsap Peninsula, WA). Another spout and then another, as it moved north toward South Whidbey. With the field glasses I finally saw a portion of its back and it appeared to be a large
gray
.

4 pm
this afternoon, we were delighted to see
5 - 6 orcas
at the east entrance to
Active Pass
. One adult male with a very large dorsal fin. They were moving slowly in circles and heading slowly east. Cheers,

Galiano Island, BC

We were lucky enough to hear a Gray whale spout once or twice somewhere in Saratoga Passage off Hidden Beach, Greenbank while hot tubbing between

12:30 and 1 am
.

Just after
6PM
2 hours before 11.4' high tide, another
gray
visit. Right, in front of dining room window; while my folks and I were eating dinner, a gray came rolling by. Really close in, with a good look at its large mauve/gray color back. Along, with splashes of white. Then, 30 seconds later, a feeding stop; only, 50 feet or less, out from shoreline. After, a 10 minute snack, a trail of spouts, headed N.E. towards
Strawberry Pt.
With, yesterday's short pass by, along with this evening; makes 9 out of 10 days, since
March 23rd, we have seen this same? single gray.
