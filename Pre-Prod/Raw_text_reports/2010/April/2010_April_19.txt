Orca Sightings for April 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gray whale
sighting below our house south of
Mabana
(SW Camano Isl) about
8 AM
yesterday. The tide was in and the whale was in close feeding. I was running late for appointments in Seattle, so only had a few minutes.
Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA

Transient orcas
near
Partridge Pt.
(NW Whidbey Island) going south in
mid afternoon
. I was on Maya's Charters and when we arrived on scene we could see that T87 and T88 were ahead of and to the west of the other five whales
T124, T124D, T124E, T90 and T90B. T87 and T88
turned toward the southwest while the other group moved further to the east and continued going south. We were there a short time and when we left I would say that T87 and T88 were at least 2 miles from the group of five.

We saw some
pacific white sided dolphins
, this was a first ever sighting of white sides in the
Everett
area on one of our tours.

Orca Network received a report of
1 orca
, 40 miles north of
Fort Bragg, CA
.

8:45 pm:
Just now began hearing a few
calls/whistles
on the
Pt. Townsend hydrophones
- maybe one of the groups of Transients that has been in & out of Admiralty Inlet today? They don't quite sound like the usual Transient or Resident calls, but are definitely some kind of cetacean call/whistle. Calls stopped for awhile, then started again at

9:27 pm
, for another 20 minutes. And again at

9:55 pm
.

What am I hearing - it sounds like
dolphin whistles
here in the Keys??

8:40 p.m.

PT hydrophones

Jill Hein found the
Transient orcas
off
NW Whidbey Island
at

1:55 pm
, they were out off
Pt. Partridge
, heading south. By
2:35 pm they were off Ebey's Landing, Central/West Whidbey Island still heading south slowly, and at 3 pm they were about 1 mile N of Ft. Worden (NW of Port Townsend) continuing south. I watched 3 dorsals all the way past the Steller haulout east of Marrowstone, but they went right on by. She then sent this update: Two were traveling together, a single one several hundred yards behind. They were not showing themselves very often. I did not see T87 at any time from Pt. Wilson south. The three were heading south east, perhaps towards Bush Point, very hard to tell.

On our 1st day out, Beam Reach student Kathryn spotted KW fins. We've ID'd them as about
5 transients
, inc 1 male. They're headed SE so listen on Port Townsend hydrophone today. From info transmitted by their SPOT tracking device, they were with the whales beginning at
8:38 am off the s
outh tip of San Juan Island
(Latitude:48.41964, Longitude: -123.09269) traveling SE with the pod until
2:20 pm, off
Central/West Whidbey Island
(Latitude:48.20447, Longitude:-122.80058).

Saw
5 Orcas
off shore north of
Partridge Point
(at the end of Libby Road) at

2:00 PM
. There was one large male, others of normal size and quite a small one in the group, too. They were followed by some sort of whale watching boat, with lots of people standing up looking. The whale watching boat was literally right along side of the whales. Then there was a second smaller boat that passed the WWB and seemed to pursue the whales more closely as they disappeared from view. The Whale Watching Boat suddenly backed off and returned toward Anacortes about
2:20.
Sue Bates, Coupeville, Whidbey Island

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called to report a pod of
Transients
at
Partridge Bank
, NW Whidbey Island at

1:25 pm
, heading south.
*
Ron Bates of MMRG in Victoria BC called to report
Transient orca male T87
and "his girlfriends" heading SE in
Haro Strait
at
9 am
, by noon they were 2 miles off Smith Island continuing SE.
*
Jason Wood of Beam Reach and the Whale Museum called to report they were with a pod of
Transient orcas
identified as male
T87
along with 5 females. They were 2.5 miles SW of Smith Island at

11:24 am
, heading SE.
*
Sandy Dubpernell and Phyllis Kind, Orca Network volunteers helping with marine mammal monitoring for the Admiralty Tidal project, called from their observation post at
Ft. Casey State Park
this morning at

10:22
to report
3 - 5 Orcas (Transients)
in Admiralty Inlet, off Marrowstone Pt. heading NW out of the Inlet. Interestingly, we have found on the days there are Transients in the Inlet, our counts of seals and porpoise go way down!
*
David Carney, captain of the Clipper IV called Orca Network to report
4-5 Orcas
heading north in Admiralty Inlet near
Lagoon Point
at

9:10 am
. No males, two possible females and two or three juveniles.

Mary Powers called to report
3 Gray whales
off the
Clinton ferry
, 1000' east, at

10:30 -
10:40 am
.
*
Gen Rowand of Oak Harbor called to report
a Gray whale
spouting off
Oak Harbor
, off Scenic Heights Rd. heading toward Maylor's Pt. at

8:35 am
- she'd been watching it for a half hour.
*
We stopped by
Crescent Harbor (Oak Harbor, Whidbey Isl
) on our way home after dinner and saw
a gray
(I am assuming the same one that has been frequenting the area) feeding and rolling just 35 feet from shore, at about 8 pm. I hope he is a happy and healthy one.
Catherine Beard, Oak Harbor
From her photos we were able to determine it's the same whale MaryJo took video of yesterday - eating ghost shrimp, so hopefully it is getting a belly full! sb
