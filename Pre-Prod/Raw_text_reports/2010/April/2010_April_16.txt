:
Transient calls
being heard (on
OrcaSound hydrophones
). It's
Pender T-14
- he is the only one in here today as far as I know - more out in the Strait. I started hearing him this morning at about
8:30 then again at about noon. He ended up by Halibut Island and then has come back south. Is currently (3 pm) several miles from shore 1/2 between LK and OS Hydrophones - pretty cool!

We encountered the
T124's
this
afternoon
a couple of miles South East of
Albert Head BC
traveling tightly towards William head. As we followed the pod we observed a number of tail slaps, tail flukes, pectoral waves as the Orcas were in a very playful mood. We followed the Orcas for a while and left them at 4.00pm just off William Head.

Orcas
observed at approx.

11:10am
, Whale Point Research Cabin, UC Big Creek Reserve,
Big Sur, CA
(North 36 degrees 1'30', West 121 31'26"). 11 individuals in a mixed sex group traveling north-northwest. Approx. 5 females, 6 males (2 males with very large dorsal fins) The animals were traveling abreast and surfacing more or less simultaneously. This occurred concurrent with a large (60-75 individuals) pod of Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis) also traveling north. Another group of dolphins (likely Delphinus) were sighted at approximately
1:30pm feeding and breeching vigorously. This may have been the same group. There were also two males traveling together some distance from this main pod, also north. The main pod (11 individuals) was approximately 1.5-2km off shore.

8:23 pm:
One
gray whale
has been in a cove on the north end of
Tulalip shores
in marysville, wa for almost 2 hours. Can't see him anymore because it's getting dark, but we still hear him. Not usual for one to stay around this long.

4:30pm:
A beautiful
Grey
surfaced at the southwest corner of
Penn Cove
(inside of the Mussel farms). Moving East (toward Coupeville), we saw it surface twice before moving out of sight. He/She was traveling about 100' offshore, which I estimate to be about 20' of water depth given the tide conditions at the time.

a Gray whal
e in

at

We are watching a whale right from the deck of the WorldMark Resort (west side of Discovery Bay), near
Port Townsend
, WA. The whale is located in the cove just south of the resort. It has been hanging around since before

9:00 a.m
. We can only say that it looks to be a
humpback
, as we've seen the "point" on the back of it when it dives (this sounds more like a Gray whale to us). We believe there is only one, and it might be feeding here. It's just hanging out with us enjoying a beautiful Western Washington morning. Unfortunately it's too quick for us to get a picture of it yet, but we are trying. Sincerely,
Tobi LeMond, Silverdale, Washington; Greg Hill, Tacoma, Washington; Jim and Sandy Hill, Chehalis, Washington
