Orca Sightings for April 29, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
A single
gray south
of the Mabana Road (SW Camano Island) at
8PM
. It was out from shore and diving deep with the spout side lighted by the setting sun. Looked to be slowly moving south.
Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA
*
Two large marine animals headed north towards the opening of
Hood Canal
, spotted north of Port Gamble, about

5:30
. Gray whales? We did not see a dorsal fin and they were certainly much larger than the many harbor porpoises dipping through the sea at the same time. Harsh sun glare made it difficult to confirm.
