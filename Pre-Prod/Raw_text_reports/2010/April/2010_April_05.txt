Orca Sightings for April 5, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
0930 Bells Beach (NE of Langley) One gray
slowly moving toward Langley, close to shore, feeding on and off. I thought his head either had beige-pink spots or barnacles when he surfaced close to my viewing, but he was back down fast, so not positive.

Jeff Hogan called at

5:30
to report
orcas
just off Fort Ward, SE tip of
Bainbridge Island
. Jeff counted
7
, including one sparky little one that was acting up a lot.
*
WA State Ferries called with a report of about
six orcas
seen at

4:40 pm
from the
Fauntleroy ferry
, headed north in the northbound shipping lane.
*
About
1500
near the VH buoy South of
Victoria
, Strait of Juan de Fuca,
5T'S
going more or less South West. Strong winds and 2+ meter seas made for poor viewing but it appeared to be
T103 and the T49's
. Last seen nearing Race Rocks heading S.W.

The
Gray whale
activity has been amazing this morning!
NW of Langley
a gray whale (looked like #531) was feeding in the shallow water at about

7:30 AM
. At about
8:15 it was in front of downtown Langley when another gray whale (#49) came from the NW and was feeding just west of our house (NW of Langley). #531 stopped feeding and swam very fast toward #49. #49 stopped feeding and started to swim fast toward #531! It looked like they were going to ram each other. When they were about 15-20 feet away from each other both of them rolled and started feeding side by side! It was very interesting to watch! Both whales continued to feed and headed off to the NW.

10:00 AM
. #531 just came by
NW of Langley
, feeding and by itself, heading to downtown Langley onto the southeast along Whidbey. I have great ID pics of both whales and will be sending them along. At

11:45
, gray whale "Patch" #49, returned to feed in the shallow water NW of Langley. Its

12:00
now and the whale has turned to the NW and is in deeper water headed in your direction (Greenbank).

Likely you heard from ace whale-spotter, our neighbor Veronica Von Allworden, about the appearance of
[gray] whales
feeding off upper 1st St on the west end of
Langley
, beginning about

7:40a
. Well, I watched
ANOTHER pair
(or the same pair returned?) beginning
8:15a until about
8:35a feeding in the same area - the bottom of my yard! One large with powerful blows, and a smaller (juvenile?) whose blows were much less powerful. They were very close to shore, and circled unhurriedly whilst feeding. Lost of shore birds picking off the floaters. In between both these appearances Langley's whale bell rang resoundingly!

I saw what looked like a
Gray Whale
off of
Keyport, Washington
this evening at about

5:00 p.m
. It was traveling south out of Liberty Bay toward Bremerton. It surfaced near the point of land that marks the northwest entrance to Agate Passage. There were several of us watching it and one of the ladies said that she saw two whale spouts but I only saw the one. It appeared to be a Gray, as it did not have much of a dorsal fin and no white markings on the tail fluke. It was traveling near the surface for about 5 minutes, blew twice and then submerged. It was mottled gray in color with what appeared to be growths on its back near the tail, so I'll assume those were some barnacle deposits.

Jeff Hogan visited Clallam where he heard about
a gray whale
in
Clallam Bay
.

Amy Carey called Orca Network about a
"big whale"
reported in
Quartermaster Harbor
, between Vashon Island and Maury Island, around mid-day today.

You probably know all about this
dead Gray Whale
already. If you haven't heard here is a picture taken this afternoon at 2.30pm from the Prince of Whales, Ocean Magic vessel out of Victoria. It had washed up on the rocks at
Beecher Bay, East Sooke
, Vancouver Island. No doubt due to the very stormy w/e here. It doesn't look very big so no doubt a young one.
