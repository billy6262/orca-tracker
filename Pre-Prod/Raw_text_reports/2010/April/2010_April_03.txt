Orca Sightings for April 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two Gray whales
off
Strawberry Point
, NE Whidbey Island, around

11:45
this morning. Dubknuck #44 looks small beside #56. They were milling about 400 yards or so from shore, back and forth, sometimes closer to land. They appeared to be diving but not showing their flukes - I saw ONE fluke in about 45 minutes.
