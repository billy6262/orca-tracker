Orca Sightings for April 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Joan Lopez sent me images that she took of the unidentified female who was associated with T103 off
Victoria
. Graeme Ellis thought that the unknown whale might be
CA58
. He is correct! CA58 was first photographed in Monterey Bay by Nancy Black of Monterey Bay Whalewatch in May of 1993. Nancy has seen her in Monterey more recently. VERY interesting that CA58 was seen off your area. Quite a few of our California transients are showing up there!

On the way to the boat today, we got wind of
Orcas
off the
Victoria Waterfront
. By the time we got there, a few other boats were on the scene, but soon left. It's great to have so few boats out this time of the year. The male is
T103
, but the female is at this time unidentified. We left them at
1500hr
, just to the east of Race Rocks headed west.

Here are a two images from today's encounter with
Transient orca T103
and an unidentified female Orca. We encountered the two Transients close
Race Rocks
. We left the Orcas traveling South West a few miles west of Race Rocks. Regards,

Orca Magic-Marie and also Joan Lopez had good saddle patch pics of the notched [
orca
], but it can still not be identified yet anyway. Pics are being sent to Graeme Ellis for further investigation.

Tony called to report 3
orcas
, including 1 male with a very large fin in
Malaspina Strait
, B.C. at

8:20 pm
. They were first heading west, then turned and headed east.
*
I was out on the Ocean Magic vessel today and we found
two Transients
around
1 pm
traveling together, about 2 miles south and west of
Victoria
. They appeared to be resting initially then the female took off in haste chasing something then circled back toward the male. Their behaviour seemed to indicate that they had taken down a prey item and each whale would dive one at a time, and remain below the surface , while the other remained at the surface. Were they sharing their meal I wonder ? Looks like I had ID correctly,
T 103
as the male - confirmed by Jeanne Hyde.

There were
two transients
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
Saturday
afternoon
first seen at Clover Pt. One adult male
T-103
and another T-? with a large notch. While on scene on Maya's Charters the notched whale didn't surface high enough to get a good saddle patch.
