============================================================

Entry 1:
Listening to
Transient orca calls
on OrcaSound's Lime Kiln hydrophone from

4:45 -
5:10 pm

4:55 pm, really good calls.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research reported being with
12 Transient orcas
in
Haro Strait
, 1.5 miles west of Hannah Heights, W. San Juan Island at

4:30 pm.
He had IDd
T87,88,90,90B, 124, 124D, 124E
(these were the T's in Saratoga Passage on Sunday and Monday), along with the
T30s - T30A, 30B, 30C, and T172
.

Wednesday
afternoon
I was on Capt. Jim Maya's boat and we met
12 transients
in
Haro Strait
. At first they were grouped together and then split into two groups, one heading north and the other south. However, they met back up in a short while and soon an encounter with a Steller sea lion occurred. It lasted for over an hour. I have posted the story about the encounter, pictures and a video clip of what happened with the Steller (it's a good watch) on my blog.

Oh those
Transients
just keep showing up. Amazing to see
15 or more
traveling together from the west, Albert Head area, where they were originally picked up this
am
. They were moving fast toward San Juan Island when we in the yellow zodiac, picked them up around
2pm
, south and east of
Trail island
. They seemed to be very happy socializing with several tail slaps, and spyhops. There were two big males, one easily ID as
T87
, with that familiar divot out of the trailing edge of his dorsal fin.
T30's
came to mind when I looked at the other male, but not sure as we were more than 150 metres away.

This afternoon around
2 PM
we had a group of
transients
heading east past
Discovery Island
. It looked to me that there were about ten of them, including two adult males who I believe were
T87 and T30A
. T88 was also in there, but I'll leave the rest of the IDs to someone else who is more familiar with transients than I am! They were fairly active with several big spyhops and tailslaps as well as some rolling at the surface. See more photos on Monika's blog here.

Erick Peirson of Port Townsend called to report several
Transient orcas
in
Admiralty Inlet
, 1 mile south of
Marrowstone Island
at

11:20 am
. He called back with an update at

12:12 pm
, the 5 - 6 Transients were between S. Marrowstone Island and Port Ludlow, circling and watching a Steller sea lion. He then reported they had gone into Hood Canal, killed a porpoise, and at

1:51 pm
were heading out of Hood Canal and off Foulweather bluff, back into Admiralty Inlet, but he was unsure of what direction they'd go.

Just saw
3 Transient
Orca north of
Bush Point
(SW Whidbey Island) headed south.

Could be Patch, not sure because the sun in setting and hard to see. But, a
gray whale
is feeding in front of
Tulalip Shores
in Marysville, Wa. Currently heading South about 30 yards off shore. Oh how I love to hear the sounds of his blows (

8:35pm
)!!!

Paula Rounds called to report
1 Gray whale
off
Polnell Shores
, NE Whidbey Island, circling around the lagoon at

7:52 pm
.

Heard from two neighbors,
a gray
passed by
Mariners Cove
, near Oak Harbor at around

6:30AM
this morning. I saw a full length gray whale on its side with both its flipper and fluke/tail, out of the water right out "IN THE FRONT YARD." AMAZING STUFF! Time was

3:15PM
with a 10.6' high tide at
6:30PM. Got boat out to whale watch. What started as an afternoon snack, became a full on 4 hour feed. It is a right sided feeder of sand shrimp. Meaning, when it feeds/suctions shrimp, it is always doing so on its right side. During the entire 4 hour feed, there was only a handful of swirling activity. Always, close to shore within 100' at all times. At

7:30PM
, after 4 hours of feeding, gray made it down at a bay near
Polnell Pt.

I went for a flight and at

4:30 PM
, saw
2 gray whales
feeding near the big marker west of
Everett
and another gray whale feeding off the shores of
Tulalip
. I was only able to ID one whale and that was number 22. It did not look like either of the other 2 whales was Patch.

Barbara Anderson called to report
1 Gray whale
off the S. tip of
Camano Island
off Wilksberry Heights at

12:30 pm
, heading north toward Pebble Beach.
*
We live at the south end of
Camano
, facing south to Langley. Today at

12:30
, we saw
two greys
swimming west/northwest, very close together. They were so close together, I thought they were one until I blew up the image on the computer. After this photo, one at a time would come up for air. They were moving so slow, sometimes they did not move at all between breaths, and many time they did not blow at all. They seemed very lethargic; we have noticed this behavior the last 3-4 days. Sometimes they don't even dive, they just hang on the surface of the water. Driving northwest to the beach at Wilkes Gary (about 1/2 way between our place on Gull Way and Pebble Beach), we watched them continue in the same direction, still moving extremely slow. In the third photo, there are once again two whales, I think, but so close together they look like one. What is the meaning of this behavior, moving so close, so slow, and staying on the surface?
Peg Boley, Camano Island
Our guess is that these whales were resting, rather than actively feeding or traveling. We do have other reports and photos of two or three Grays moving very close together. But it is interesting that in Robert's report above, the feeding whale he was watching was also moving slowly - sb

Just before
11 am
we saw a
Gray whale
close in to shore along the boach launch at
Redondo
[near Tacoma] heading south to north. He/she was moving slowly but deliberately to the north. This one looked rather small compared to others we have seen here recently. No lingering or feeding that we observed. Mark & Tracey Eide

Orca Network received a call about a possible dead whale floating off
Lagoon Pt
, SW Whidbey Island at

8:30 am
. Erick Peirson was heading out of Port Townsend so went over to take a look, and found a
live Gray whale
at

10:13 am
just north of Admiralty Head, heading NW out of Admiralty Inlet with the tide. It was moving slowly and going on deep dives.
*
Orca Network received a call from Jennifer Barwick at

3:50 pm
, she was observing
a Gray whale
30' off
Arroyo Beach
in West Seattle in very shallow water. She said it was breathing and its tail was moving, but it seemed to be staying in one place. We called Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales who is also a NOAA Fisheries trained Marine Mammal Stranding volunteer who lives near there, and he arrived on scene at approximately
4 pm
. He and Jennifer continued to observe the whale, and it
stopped breathing and moving
by around 4 pm. The initial exam showed it is a
33' long female
, looking thin, but no obvious signs of trauma or cause of death. This is the 3rd Gray whale to die in inland waters over the past 5 days, two others washed up on
April 4th - one in Shelton, WA and one off Sooke, B.C. So far, it appears all five of these whales were undernourished.
