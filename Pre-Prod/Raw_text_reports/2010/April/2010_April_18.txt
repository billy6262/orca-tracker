We watched
a single gray whale
(estimated 25-30 feet) feeding about 100 feet off the beach of
crescent harbor
on the Navy seaplane base for over an hour between

6:30 PM and
8:00 PM.
It was in approximately 12-15 feet of water just beyond the beach stones where the sandy bottom begins. It was swimming and rolling on its side, feeding up and down the beach at a slow walking pace. You could smell its exhalation it was so close!

Heather reported
a Gray whale
near
Port Ludlow last night
, rolling in shallow water near Seal Rock, heading toward the rock quarry.
*
Approx

5:00PM
,
a gray
visited
Gold Beach (Maury Island)
, about 15 yards off shore, rubbing against the sand. Was a treat to see. Looked healthy - moved on after about 10 minutes entertaining us human and canine types on the shore.

3 to 5 Gray whales
observed in
Port Susan Bay, Everett WA
, on a line between Gedney Island and the south end of Jetty Island (LAT N 48 0' 29.8807" ; LON W 122 16' 42.6672" ), generally "hanging around" that general area, at
1500
hrs.

We would like to report
a gray whale
spotted this
afternoon
in
Boundary Bay
. There was one whale, appeared to be circling in the Bay, at
2:27pm (GPS: N49 degrees 1.075 W122 degrees 50.898). Regards,

Port Gardner East of Hat Island:
2 gray whales
were slowly heading north, diving and one spyhopped a few times around
1pm
. They appeared to be a mother and a calf or juvenile pair. At

2:50pm
we were sailing south and encountered
a gray whale
(positive ID #723 - see above photo) in
Possession Sound
off Glendale travelling north at a good pace and diving. These whales were the first whale sightings for 3 of my friends and the spyhopping was definitely the highlight of the day!

We had more
Transients
(the mammal eating Orcas) and followed them almost to
Pt. Townsend
. The were beautifully framed by Mt. Baker. The number of Transient sightings this year has been amazing. We don't know why. Are there more of them than before? My feeling is that we are seeing them more often because of better communication between the members of the whale watching community. I include not only the commercial whale watchers, but the scientific community and any number of recreational whale watchers. The communication has increased through channels like Facebook (Yes!) and Orcanet. The hydrophones have helped and of course, more boats and people than ever before are aware that they might be out there. We are thinking of them more. The Ts have no shortage of food, like our Resident Orcas, the salmon eaters sometimes face. We have a zillion seals out there. Just some random thoughts.

I saw Ken's report on OrcaNet and thought I'd contribute some pictures of those
orcas
that were sighted today (in
Monterey Bay
). We kept our distance because we knew researchers were there, so the photos are not too great. I hope you can possibly get some ID's from them. A male has a pretty good nick about halfway down his dorsal fin (see photo above).

Frank White of Port Townsend called to report
6 orcas
, 3 male and 3 female, heading out of Admiralty Inlet, mid-channel off
Pt. Wilson
heading NW toward Victoria at

9:15 am
.
*
We received reports from the GPS on Ken Balcomb's Center for Whale Research boat that is currently in
Monterey Bay, CA
. They were with
orcas
from

10:54 am -
11:39 am
, in the middle of
Monterey Bay
off the deep underwater canyons midway between Monterey and Santa Cruise. Lat/Long at first report was: 36.74497, -122.04442; lat/long for last report was: 36.77282, -122.07514.
We are assuming these are Transients, but don't know for sure, so will provide an update and more details when we hear from Ken!
*
I think we identified the two
[gray] whales
as #383 and #22 off the south end of
Hat Island
, looking south towards the View Ridge neighborhood of Everett.

I was down on our beach doing a low tide walk about
1 PM
today, when I heard and saw the Mystic Sea stopped out in
Saratoga Passage
. They were with
one gray
(off SW Camano Isl). Later, about
4 PM
, I was sitting out on our deck and spotted a dark back out a ways off our beach. I watched it for some time and saw several rolls, but only one weak blow and no tail flukes. It was very calm and the gray's blows usually echo across the water. The whale was fairly dark, seemed small, but bigger than a porpoise and definitely not an Orca.

The 2nd whale does sound like it could possibly have been a Minke - we get them every once in awhile in Saratoga Passage, but it is rare - sb.

11:50 am
: We just saw
Patch
between the south end of Hat Island and the jetty. Feeding in 30 or so feet of water. He appeared no worse for wear after being attacked by orcas last Sunday.

11:55
: Another one by the ferry dock and a third mid-channel.

12:00
: "Moving north. Both north of the ferry now. One whale is
#53
."

12:10
: "Two moving north toward south end of Hat. One moving south in the channel towards Mukilteo."

Erick Peirson called to report one
Gray whale
off
Scatchet Head
, SW Whidbey Island at

11:45 am
.
*
We went
South of Whidbey Island
and watched
a Gray whale
feed for over an hour with P.S. Express!

Mary Jo Adams called at

10:20 am
to report
a Gray whale
feeding in
Crescent Harbor
, E of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island. She posted a video of the whale feeding (it looks like the same whale reported & photographed in Crescent Harbor over the past week), and another video after the tide went out, showing the feeding pits left by the whale as it sucked up mud and ghost shrimp, and she even found some shrimp it had left behind! Judging by the number of ghost shrimp holes in the video, it appears this whale has found a good spot to find food, which is always good news! These videos are also posted on our Orca Network Facebook Page - MANY THANKS to Mary Jo for providing this instant, wonderful look into a Gray whale having breakfast!

in
Crescent Harbor

8:00am
