Orca Sightings for April 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
5 transients T36A, T36A1, T65A, T65A2, T65A3
-(not in current ID book - born in 2007) were seen in
President Channel
(west of Orcas Is.). T65A3 has an interesting saddle patch for a transient. While most are closed saddles this whale T65A3 appears to have an open saddle on his/her right side. T64A has a distinct notch not only at the top of the trailing edge of her dorsal fin but also on the edge of her fluke.

Jeff LaMarche of Eagle Wing Tours called to report a pod of
4 Transient orcas
north of
Orcas Island
at Parker Reef, heading west at

4:45 pm
. The pod was all females, none of which looked familiar to him. They had been off Matia Island earlier and took down a Harbor seal.
*
The last time these
transients
came by our front window overlooking
Sucia Island
. It was during my morning cup of coffee a couple of weeks ago. Now I'm home for lunch (

2:25 pm
) and there they are. Earlier today they were off Yellow Island, traveling up to Sucia in about five hours.

small Gray whale
off
Rosario Beach, Deception Pass State Park
at

4:25 pm
- it had apparently been seen by others and had been there several hours. She watched it until around
7 pm
- it remained about 20' offshore in 6' of water, swimming back and forth but not feeding. At around 7 pm it swam off.

4:55 pm:
Just watched
a [gray] whale
from the beach on
Camano Island, Madrona beach
area - watched and listened and it was so cool - was just too far away for me to get a photo of it though. Someone on the beach said they had been swimming right up close to shore yesterday (4/21) - wish i had seen that.

While walking my dogs on the beach on Thursday afternoon at

2:30 pm
, we were entertained by a
large gray whale
about 20 yards away. It stayed close into shore for about 10 minutes, coming to the surface with spectacular blows half a dozen times. It then moved rapidly away to the north. We saw it near Greenbank at the foot of Labrador Lane.

I was out with Island Adventures today. We saw
five gray whales
feeding between the jetty and the Mission Beach marker about noon (
Everett area
). They were feeding in shallow water, so we saw lots of splashing, pecs and flukes. About
1 p.m.
, we got some good looks at another gray feeding in the tide line near the south end of Hat.

Boathouse and Owen Beach.

Gray whale
sighting right off the Lakota Beach shore (between Dumas and Poverty Bays) in
Federal Way
this morning around

7:45am
. It appeared to be feeding and making its way South toward Dash Point. We rarely get whales through this channel and when we do they are often on the other side near Maury and Vashon Islands.

We saw
two grey whales
about halfway between
Everett and Hat Island
heading southeast from our Ranger 25 ft tug. They were only about 100-200 yds away and came up about five times!

At

10:30am
we heard
gray whale
blows close in along
Tulalip Shores
. We heard blows heading south along shore for about 5 minutes. Then we caught sight of one gray as he moved out away from shore, reversed direction and headed north. We watched as the whale headed toward Spee-be-dah bay. There he followed the shore line, rolling around and feeding. At

11:30am
, we lost sight of the whale, as it rounded the point on the north end of Spee-bi-dah.
