today.

This morning at

5:00 AM
, we awoke to hear
a gray whale
feeding in the shallow waters NW of
Langley
. The whale stayed for about 25 minutes circling back for more. It then headed out to the deeper water past the drop-off swimming towards downtown Langley. We could see its fluke in the dawn, as it continued to dive deep swimming to the SE.
