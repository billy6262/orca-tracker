Orca Sightings for April 15, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mike Beck, a commercial crabber, reported a pod of
10 - 15 orcas
, including 6 - 8 males with large fins in 80' of water off Split Rock, near
Raft River, WA (s. of Kalaloch)
. Approx. Lat/Long:47.28 N, 124.24 W. He saw a lot of feed & bait & birds & pelicans nearby.
*
At approximately
1600
hrs, Ly and I arrived on scene with a very large group of
Transient Killer Whales
4nm SE of
Discovery Island
(Seabird Lt.) I.D.'s included
T-14, T-87, T-88, T90 and calf T-90B, T-124, T-124D, T-124E, T-30, T-30A, T-30B, T-30C, T-172
and one of my favourite's,
T-63
(Chainsaw) !!! The animals were spread into 3 or 4 social groups as they slowly swam to the Southeast towards Whale Rks. During our stay with this large group of T's, we saw many breaches, tail flips and head stands. Our encounter ended just to the Southeast of Middle Bank at 1700 hrs.

A whale [
orca
] - a sprouter perhaps. There was also a group of three - a female and two young whales (not the T137s) that positive IDs have not yet been made. I've posted pics on my blog of these mystery whales as well as the last three days of encounters. And to add to Jeff's listing of whales, also seen were
T36, T36B, T99, T99A
, Marie (aka Orca Magic) had
T137, T137A, T137B, and T137C
plus the 4 mystery whales.

Penn Cove Gray whale
- So last night (4/15) he ate, rolled, and played up and down the shallows here in Penn Cove. North side near Scenic Heights road. This went on till
midnight
. I called the Orca network because at one point he was so close to the shore I was worried. Theresa Gonsalves, Penn Cove, Whidbey Island

7:20 pm
, Just saw two maybe
three female orcas
in
Saratoga Passage
, Camano Side, by Breezy Point (near Elger Bay/Camano Island State Park area). Were traveling North towards Cama Beach.

Orca Network received a call from Theresa at

6:44 pm
reporting
several orcas
in
Saratoga Passage
between East Pt/Baby Island (entrance to Holmes Harbor) and Camano Island.
*
We heard there was a large group of transients at
Race Rocks
headed east, towards Friday Harbor. We took the MV Sea Lion south past Long Island. Dorsal fins and blows were finally in the distance. Upon getting there, we identified about
12 transients
, a large group for stealthy marine mammal eating Orcas. One of them,
T63
was especially astounding as he had 2 equally sized chunks taken out of the top of his dorsal fin, possibly from prey that fought back.

Orca Network received a call from Steven Hoffman reporting
1 - 2 Gray whales
in
Penn Cove
, near Monroe's Landing on the N. side of the cove at

8:25 pm
.
*
Veronica von Allworden of Langley called us to report
4 or 5 orcas
off
Camano Head
, SW Camano Island at

5:40 pm
, heading north up Saratoga Passage. The pod included 1 calf.
*
WOW what a day on the water for
Transients
again - we had a BIG group south and west of
Race Rocks
initially and they weren't going anywhere. They were seen lolly-gagging around with behaviours that looked like Southern Resident behaviours. They were breaching, spyhopping, tail-lobbing, backward swimming, and generally greeting one another socially.
T63
was really into greeting all those females out there. If we hadn't been able to ID 'Chainsaw, T63, right away and Pender, T14 off by himself it would have looked like SR's as there were four big male Dorsal fins among all those females and youngsters. I believe we had at least
T30's
again and
T172
, and the
T124's
and the new calf.
T10
and
T10B
. There were others, but hard to count.
Perhaps 25+
. They eventually started to head east, past Victoria. We left them at Seabird Lighthouse still heading toward San Juan Island.

Gray
swimming in
Crescent Harbor
around
3 pm
, apparently cruising and not feeding, spouting only a couple times before disappearing about forty yards off pier on seaplane base.
