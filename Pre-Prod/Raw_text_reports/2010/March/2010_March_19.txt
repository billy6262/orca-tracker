Entry 3:
I live in
Penn Cove
just off West Scenic Heights before
Monroe Landing Road
. This evening while letting out the dogs at

11:30 PM
I heard a large long blow hole. I waited for awhile and heard it again three more times. Long loud and big. I live on a 40 foot cliff and this is my second encounter here in Penn Cove. We heard a blow hole two weekends ago while sailing in very calm waters in the same area. I am so excited as I moved here from Wisconsin last May and this is my first whale sighting.

We have been watching undetermined whale for approximately 40 minutes. We live in a condo just off the beach, eastern shore of East Passage -
Commencement Bay, Tacoma
. Appears to be
a single whale
, difficult to tell what breed but looks to us rather large, possible Gray. Has not breached but have seen part of its back above water. First spotted the spout approximately 500 yards off shore just south (maybe 100 yards) of the floating breakwater at Redondo boat launch (just couple hundred feet south of Salty's restaraunt). Circled for a bit, then headed south, closer in to shore, perhaps less than 300 yards. Has stayed in this area for 30 minutes. If familiar with the area, 150 yards south of the southern end of the boardwalk at Redondo. Will stay under for between 3 and 8 or 9 minutes, then spout several times before submerging again. Wish we could tell type but certainly a whale of some kind.
