Orca Sightings for March 29, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gary Kennedy called to alert me.

6:15 to ~
6:20pm
,
3 orcas
off Gary's house, North Beach,
Pt. Townsend, WA
, ~ Â¼ mile from public access beach heading very slowly westward toward Protection Island. 2 were swimming together, one was smaller than the other. 3rd whale small distance away. ~ 100 ft off shore. Lots of birds and 2 sea lions present in H2O when I first saw them. Did not see sea lions again until after orcas gone. Obviously large school of fish due to activity on the water. Whales kept surfacing and diving. Saw their fins, back and occasionally tail as dove.

We have a beach house on
Elger Bay on Camano Island
. Unsure of exact amount, but it appeared to be
three Gray whales
seen on both Monday and Tuesday. Not far off the beach, in Elger Bay, on Camano Island, Washington (Lat 48 degrees, 7.8 minutes North; Long 122 degrees, 28.2 minutes West). They appeared to be slowly moving East. We are pretty sure they were feeding, as they were close to the beach and it looked like they were swimming on their side, with their (arm) flippers out of the water. We think they were digging up the sand in order to find food.

I had
3 orca's
off shore by my house at

6:15 pm
. They were fishing or playing, spent ~ 10 mins surfacing and diving just off North Beach in
Port Townsend
. One was smaller than the others, the small one stayed by one of the larger ones, 3rd was usually off to the side.

After getting the report of
a Gray whale
off
Hidden Beach
last night, we went down to find it. We watched from around

6:30 - 7 pm
- it had headed S, then N. again - but we finally spotted it close to shore just N. of Hidden Beach, Greenbank, then mid-channel, and then heading back south down Saratoga Passage.

Glanced out our window about
