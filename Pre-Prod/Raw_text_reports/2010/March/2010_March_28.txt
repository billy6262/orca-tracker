Orca Sightings for March 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I heard about a juvenile
gray
in
Liberty Bay
the weekend before Easter. Our friends at Liberty Bay Marina said it surfaced and blew not far from the outer float at the marina, heading slightly north up into the bay.

It was another full on dinner, in rough seas; at
Mariners Cove [N.E. Whidbey]
this evening for
a single gray whale
. Gray, must like what's on the menu here. No reservations required for this VIP guest. We saw neighbor's guest taking pictures and thought it was about the big waves coming in; until we saw spouts. Very, very close into shore. Closest, I have ever seen [50/60 TO 75 MAX FEET OFFSHORE] which is surprising due to rough seas. You would think gray would keep further away from shore, due to large/choppy forceful waves pushing it in, towards shore. We saw feeding begin before
7PM
[probably, not at the start of its feeding] and last spouts seen heading SW towards
Polnell Pt. at
7:45 PM
, feeding the entire time.
Rather than opine, here are questions that came to mind, during gray's visit.
1) Lengthy feed in rough seas. Could large waves help stir up sand/assist and make it easier [not more difficult] for gray to swirl around/feed on the ghost/sand shrimp?
2) Why so close to shore in rough seas? Is there a type of back eddy or pushing up wave action; that can assist and/or make whale, more buoyant? Kinda, opposite to what one might think; as, in, concern of large waves pushing gray onto shore and potential beaching. BOTTOMLINE, is that gray didn't appear to have any problem whatsoever, with stormy churning waters.

Sunday at

7:00 pm
a
single gray whale
swam past
Tulalip Shores
about 25 yards offshore, heading north towards Spee-bi-dah. The whale was not stopping to eat, but rather appeared to be on a dedicated course north.

A
single grey whale
was seen from
Possession Point State Park
, at aproximately
7pm
, traveling north. We watched it for quite a distance, it would surface 3-4 times in a row then travel quite a ways before surfacing again. The blow sound was quite loud. We watched from the deck until we couldn't see him any further.

Went looking for the
Gray
this morning and I was not disappointed. At

9:15 am
from
Carkeek Park
( N Seattle) I could spot it's spray down south off the point at Golden Garden's. I talked with a fisherman who had seen the Gray in the inlet between the two parks throughout the morning, 50 yards off shore. He said he also saw a dorsal fin (so maybe an orca is back. ? ) and harbor seal popped up near him as well. I headed to and arrived at Golden Garden's about

9:45
and YEAH!!! spotted the Gray just off the north point, about 100 yards off shore, Big and Beautiful !!! At first it was headed slowly in a northeast direction, but mostly it was circling and milling around the same general area, surfacing about every 2-4 minutes. I watched it until
11:00 am at which time it was slowly headed in a southwesterly direction near that green bouy. The picture below is from Golden Garden's

We have had a mature (approximately 30' to 40')
gray whale
within 25 yards of shore in front of our house for 30 minutes at a time. We live on the south shore of Oak Bay near Admiralty Inlet, j
ust north of Port Ludlow
, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula. Our GPS position is 47 degrees-58 minutes-17 seconds north and 122 degrees-41 minutes-9 seconds west. It appears to be either feeding or scraping itself in the shallow waters, but does not appear to be in distress. Regards,

We spotted
one gray whale
off Discovery Park's South Beach (just east of West Point) in
Seattle
. We watched it for probably twenty minutes and it didn't travel far at all, but blew several times and we were able to see some mottled coloring and lack of a dorsal fin. This was at about

3:30 pm
, but the whale had been reported by some visitors a little bit prior to this time.
Kit Benshoof, Docent Coordinator & Naturalist, Discovery Park
Our guess would be a Gray whale since there were other sightings and photos of a Gray off W. Seattle yesterday. Often when a Gray is feeding, only its pectoral fin & fluke tip are visible and can sometimes be confused with a dorsal fin.
*
At about
1 p.m
. we observed
a single small Gray whale
close to shore at
Discovery Park's North Beach
. His back, mottled black and gray, broke the surface several times. He then disappeared underwater, emerging three or four minutes later spouting and heading north in the direction of Shilshole Marina. This is probably the same small Gray reported near Carkeek Park on
March 22 and 26.
