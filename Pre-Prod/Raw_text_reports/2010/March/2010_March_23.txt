Orca Sightings for March 23, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Marlene Vale called Orca Network to report a sighting of
3 Gray whales
at
9 am
, off
North Camano Island
, heading east. One of the whales was smaller than the other 2.
*
30 minutes before a
10AM
high tide;
a single gray
started what became a major meal near
Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Isl)
. After, feeding out front for 30 minutes, I took to the water via boat to continue whale watch. Gray, fed very close to shore for over an hour, slowly heading southwest towards Polnell Pt. Along, the way, gray slept?/rested just off shore, probably its body, on the bottom for about 45 minutes after the hour feed. Pretty much in the same place, with once every minute spouts. Then, started feeding again, all the way down to N.E. of Polnell Pt. Turned around, and headed back up to Mariners Cove, feeding most of the way. At Mariners Cove, at

12:30PM
, [3 hours after first seen in this area] it turned around again, and went out to deeper waters in mid channel. Heading, S or SW, back towards Polnell Pt. To all concerned, yes, throughout feeding/resting, I kept boat a respectful distance away, with motor mostly turned off. However, one time, while I was adrift 100/125 yards away, talking to a guy fishing, it headed right for us and came within/less? than 50 feet to briefly feed for a minute or two, before moving on.

to report
1 Gray whale
heading west off Sandy Pt, near Edgecliff, S. of
Langley
, Whidbey Island, WA. There were many feeding pits in the little cove at the end of Edgecliff.

We had the pleasure of watching a large single
gray whale
feeding a bit south of Strawberry Point on NE Whidbey for (at least) a half hour in the
morning
. We noticed him around
10 am
though he may have been there earlier. He was slowly working his way south.
*
At

4:00 pm
my sister watched
two female Orcas
100-200 feet off shore from the parking lot at
Carkeek park (N. Seattle)
. They were swimming around in the area and surfacing, heads out too. She had to leave at
4:15 at which time they were slowly headed North. My husband and I made it to Carkeek by

5:30
and spotted them just south of Carkeek headed south towards Golden Garden's. They were about 500-1000 feet offshore at this time. We could only see their dorsal fins and spouting/sprays. We left at

7:15
and they were still just north-side of Golden Gardens.
