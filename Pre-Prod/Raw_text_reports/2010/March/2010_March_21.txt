Orca Sightings for March 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our first sighting of
gray whales
in 2010.
North end of Camano Island
(+48° 15' 35.58"N, -122° 30' 56.72W"). There were
2 gray whales
they were moving east. We watched from
7:00 pm till about

7:30
.

I didn't have my binoculars, but several people were watching
a large whale
traveling south off
Hastie Lake Road (NW Whidbey Island)
at

4:30 PM
. There was a large visible spout of water quite a ways off shore. People were smiling to see one on the west side of the island!

4.15 pm
from Hastie Lake Road (off West Beach, NW Whidbey Isl) - Dick and I spotted
a grey whale
traveling south. Although we watched through binoculars for about 15 minutes it was too far away to get photographs.

My husband and I spotted
one Grey Whale
in
Crescent Harbor
- (the span of beach on NAS Whidbey's Seaplane Base, in
Oak Harbo
r, just behind Crescent Harbor housing) today around
noon
. He went back and forth for a bit--we spotted him while we were still on shore and watched a bit, and then set off for a very close to shore trip in a kayak. The whale stayed parallel with us maybe 150-200 yards away for quite some time. We stayed very close to shore--close enough that we could put the paddle down and touch bottom most of the time, so it wasn't too far off. When it did divert from the parallel path with us, it seemed to be heading along the shore to the Southeast. There is a small peninsula there, and once the whale was close to that I lost sight of it. We probably watched the whale for 25-30 minutes. Despite the fact that I said 'he/him' above I have no idea if it was a male or a female. It spouted a quite a few times and would come just slightly out of the water--only enough for us to see it's head and back from time to time (I'm not up on my whale lingo, sorry!) ;) I will say today is definitely right up there in my top five days of amazing days of being here in the PNW!!!!

We observed
two grey whales
for 30 minutes about 100-200 yards off
Mabana beach of Camano Island
. They stayed close together at the surface showing their pectoral fins often. After about 20 minutes, they moved away from the shore where we could not track them anymore. We observed them this morning from about

11:00 AM to about
11:30
.

Fred Lundahl of Langley called to relay a report from Sharon Wandler of
3 Gray whales
in front of Witter Beach (bet. Langley & Clinton, SE Whidbey Isl.), between

9:30 &
10:30 am
. One of the whales was huge!
