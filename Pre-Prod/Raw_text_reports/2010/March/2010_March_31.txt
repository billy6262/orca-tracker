Orca Sightings for March 31, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw at least two whales spouting and rolling in
Liberty Bay
between the Poulsbo marina and the Yacht Club marina. We live on Fjord Drive near Oyster Plant Park and saw them about 3-4 times for about an hour starting at
6 pm
. Many people were lined up along Fjord Drive and on the docks to watch them. Two people were in kayaks and were very close when one surfaced just south of the Yacht Club Marina. They looked like
Grays
, one large and one small, perhaps a mother and calf. About 7 pm, just before it got dark, I observed one of the whales surfacing and heading toward the head of the bay.

Just a distant sighting, here, at
Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Isl)
. A couple of spouts, from several hundred yards out; ending, in a dive with a fluke/tail [good bye]. Then, gone.

12:05 PM
, near Victor Hotel off the
Victoria Waterfront
. The deep sea freighter ran right through the middle of a pod of
15 or so transients Orcas
, never slowing or changing course. None of the Orcas retreated nor seemed disturbed, or changed course either.

My wife and I spotted
two Orca whales
West of
Harstene Island
, just South of Jerrel cove in
So. Puget Sound
at ~

5:20 PM
.. They were headed South toward the bridge to Harstene. They submerged and surfaced about 12 times, then submerged and did not resurface about 1000 yards North of the bridge. Shortly after, we spotted several Orca heading North up Pickering Passage. I think there were three or four. The time was a little after

6:00 PM
.

Donna Fisher called from Stretch Island in
Case Inlet, between Harstene Island and Key Peninsula
, to report
5 orcas
heading north, between

7:30 and
7:45 AM
today. She said there were 2 adults and 3 calves. She called back at

10:30
to say they were now headed west near Harstene Island, and that it looked like there were
six orcas
.

Ken Balcomb called at
5 pm
from the ferry Coho en route from
Victoria to Port Angeles
, with a report of
15-20 transients
, heading east between Race Rocks and Trial Island.
*
Transients
were heard early in the morning so our passengers gathered earlier than planned and we headed out at

10:00 AM
. With the help of Mark Malleson, we found a large group of Transient Orcas about
6 miles southeast of Victoria
. Calm seas, amazing skies, and playful Orcas. We left them about 7 miles West of Victoria. Not a bad day.

The day began with hearing
Transient calls
at about

6:15 a.m.
on the
OrcaSound hydrophone
(NW San Juan Island) I spotted them coming south in Haro Strait, near
Kelp Reef
marker at

6:55 a.m
. and followed them (via binocs) all the way down Discovery Island and until they went out of view. I went out with Capt. Jim Maya at 10 and with direction from Mark Malleson we found the Ts - apx 15 animals - south of Discovery Island - as in the morning they were moving slowly and changing direction. There appeared to be a new calf. With the new calf and mom was a juvenile - brother or sister perhaps. The whales slowly continued west in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
when we left.

Karen of Camano Island called to report
2 Gray whales
, 1 large and 1 small, feeding off
Mabana Beach, SW Camano Island
at

5:30 pm
.
*
At

5:00 this afternoon
, we were looking across
Saratoga Passage
at Sandy Point, where two or three
[gray] whales
looked to be feeding or slowly moving south. As we were watching them, another large grey appeared moving south in front of our bank, about 100 yards out. He appeared out of nowhere, as we did not hear him approach with blows. He blew twice, then disappeared to the south, toward Hat Island. He seem to be holding his breath for long distances; otherwise we would have heard him coming.

Veronica von Allworden called at

9:44 am
to report
a Gray whale
observed from the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
, closer to Mukilteo and heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island. Later updates: One more report today, Eric was flying at

3:40 pm
and spotted
three gray whales
north of
Camano Point
at the entrance to Port Susan. The whales were not feeding but were headed towards Everett. Eric just returned from his flight. At

5:15 PM
, he flew near the big marker west of Everett and northeast of
Hat Island
. All three whales that he saw earlier were there and all three were feeding in the shallow water on the big sand shoals.

A lone gray
passed by our home, between
Polnell shores and Mariner's Cove
, today, at about

4:30 pm
. It rolled onto its side at one point, showing its pectoral fin, presumably feeding, but after that one snack, continued on to the Mariner's Cove neighborhood (NE?) at a steady cruise.

I headed to Hill Road, (S of
Ebey's Landing, W/Central Coupeville
) and SAW the
[gray] whale
underwater, right in front of me (around
1 pm
). He did not show much of himself, was traveling approx 3-4 mph I estimated, and I only saw him surface this one time.
