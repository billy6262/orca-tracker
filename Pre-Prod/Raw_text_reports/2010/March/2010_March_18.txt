Orca Sightings for March 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was just leaving the Victoria office to head back to San Juan Island in late afternoon when Jim Maya called with a report of
transients
and a sea lion near
Kelp Reef
in Haro Strait. I arrived on scene at
1723
and observed seven transient killer whales (
T124A, 124A1, 124A2, 124A3, 124A4, 86A, and 86A baby
) swimming rapidly and erratically in circles in the tide rips. Jim said that he had seen them thrashing a sea lion about thirty minutes earlier, but had not seen it since. At 1807, I briefly saw a very relaxed looking Steller sea lion just in front of T124A1, but could not determine if it was still alive. Gulls arrived around the same time, so I presume a trophic transition was underway. The tide was flowing rapidly and pushing us all toward Henry Island when I left at 1827. I came away very impressed, once again, at how tough these one ton sea lions are; but, they are no match for a pod of killer whales.

Around
1630
, we saw
two Grey whales
heading west, up
Port Susan in Front of Sunny Shores
. After watching them slowly pass in front of our house about 150 yds off shore, we were treated to one of the whales launching vertically out of the water more than Â½ the distance of its body and slashing down. Don't know if it was the second whale or the same one, but moments later, we observed it a second time. The whales then continued heading up the shoreline towards McKee's Beach and Kayak Pt. Wow, that was a real treat!!! We have had lots of sightings since the end of Feb.

As I was preparing to leave Victoria and come back to San Juan Island in the
afternoon
, Jim Maya called me with a report of a half dozen
Transients
one mile SE of
Kelp Reef
. I spent about an hour with them just before sunset and documented
T86A and T124A's
. Dave will check the photos tomorrow and we can let you know exactly who was there. It was freezing cold and choppy in the north wind! At least one sea lion was taken by the whales. Jim said he saw one sea lion and then it was gone for half an hour. Later, I saw one sea lion pushed around by the whales.

Orcasound hydrophone 1646
-
Transient orca calls
. Val's automated detector picked (transient calls?) up this afternoon. No other detections before or after at Orcasound or any other hydrophones, so no indication of direction without further analysis.

We were lucky enough to find
Transient Orcas
on the West Side of
San Juan Island
, on the Canadian Side of
Haro Strait
. We were just leaving the Kelp Reef marker, after watching eagles and sea lions, headed south toward Lime Kiln, when Jonathan shouted out, "What's that?" "Orcas!" I said. They proceeded to kill and eat a Steller's Sea Lion, weighing perhaps 2200 lbs. It was an amazing sight that I have seen only two other times, and both times right in this area. One other time the sea lion got away.

At about

2:30PM
today noted a feeding
Gray whale
just off the beach at
Ebey's Landing, W. Whidbey Island
.

Gray whale
spotted approximately

2:20pm
about 5ft off shoreline at
Ebey's Landing in Coupeville, WA
. The whale was traveling south along the coast it has been seen (or a gray whale) at this beach for the last couple weeks. Not sure if any of my pictures show the whale, there was a gentleman there who followed the whale down the coastline quite a way down taking photographs.

Sammye Kempbell of Coupeville called Orca Network to report a
Gray whale
off
Ebey's Landing at
2:20 pm.
She watched it about 15 minutes and saw its head and flukes, and 6 - 7 spouts as it traveled south toward Ft. Casey State Park.

Mary Pacher of Greenbank called Orca Network to report
2 Gray whales
in the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes
at
