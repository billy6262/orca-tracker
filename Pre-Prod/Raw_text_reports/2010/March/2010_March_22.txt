Orca Sightings for March 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the early afternoon of
March 22nd, a group of us were thrilled to see a smallish gray whale close to shore off Carkeek Park in Seattle. After about 15 minutes, we suddenly saw two, maybe three, orca dorsal fins approach the gray, and appear to harass it. We all commented on how unusual that seemed. After another 10 or so minutes, the gray started moving north along the shore, with the orcas still nudging right up alongside it. At the time, I called a NOAA phone number someone gave me and reported this into a voicemail. I hadn't learned about Orca Net yet. Clarissa Fetrow (via Facebook)

My husband and I saw
a gray whale
from our deck at about

7:15 pm
tonight. It was about 300 yards off the shore of
Indian Beach, Camano Island
, heading south. It spouted and surfaced a few times, it didn't really linger, it seemed to be just passing through (via facebook).

12:35-
12:50 p.m
: lone whale - appeared to be
a small gray whale
, covered with barnacles, in shallow water which is bare sand during lower than normal low tides. Approximately 1 mile south of
Carkeek Park in Seattle
(47° 42' 23.2452"N, 122° 22' 49.692" W), moving slowly south/southeastward, appeared to be feeding. sorry, no photos or videos - only other whales seen in this same area was a pod of Orcas (including juvenile/s) in October approximately 10 years ago.
Update -
1:45 pm: Tony called us to report that the
Gray whale
had circled back north, and now there were
2 Orcas
swimming in circles in the same area - at one point all 3 whales were close together! They were going back and forth, both north and south, and all 3 whales were still there until some time between
2:15 &
2:30 pm when he had to leave.

From the West Seattle Blog: Orca Network had passed along news of
a few orcas
spotted off Carkeek Park in North Seattle earlier today - and now we've just heard from Vanessa at Alki that it looks like they're
off Alki Point/Lighthouse
as of a few minutes ago (~

2:35 pm
), "heading toward the islands."
*
Orca Network received a call from Brad Hanson at NOAA Fisheries in Seattle, relaying a report from a co-worker that
3 Orcas
were sighted off
Carkeek Park, N. Seattle
, from the parking lot, between 8 - 9 am. No direction of travel was given
*
Orca Network received a call from Ken Hitchings, volunteer for the Whale Watch Spoken Here program, reporting
6 - 8 orcas
sighted from Ecola State Park near
Cannon Beach OR
at
3 pm
today, heading south ~.5 - .75 mile offshore.

We heard
a whale breathing
and saw plumes a few times tonight at sunset. Location in
Saratoga Passage
from the Camano side near Indian Beach.

Sandy Dubpernell relayed a report of
a Gray whale
, observed from somewhere on
Camano
at
5 pm
, heading west.

This time I got to see
the whale
, not just his feeding pits. This AM about

9:30
, I noticed our neighbor on the edge of the bluff with his camera. Sure enough,
a lone gray
was in so close to the bluff I hadn't see it from the house. I watched him feed for over half and hour. Sometimes the gray floated on his side, with his head down, without moving either fluke not fin for quite some time. That's when the seabirds moved in very close. When the whale swished his tail, the seabirds scattered, only to regroup as things quieted down (see photo). Unfortunately, no ID shots. Hope the neighbor might have one.

March 21 & 22: Last evening (3/21) my wife and I watched
a gray whale
moving between
Polnell Pt and Strawberry Pt
(48deg 16'N, 122deg 32'W) eastward. Just now -
12:50 pm, 3/22, we were treated to a very close gray whale slowly moving westward in the same area but much closer to Camano Island. We first saw it about 300 yards off our beach (48deg 15'40"N, 122deg 30'32"W) and watched it moving toward the Maple Grove boat launch. BR>Gerard Pence,
Camano Island

March 21 & 22: Chrissy McLean of the Pt. Townsend Marince Sci. Center relayed a report of
a Gray whale
in
Oak Bay, between Indian and Marrowstone Islands, WA

March 21st at 3 pm, heading south, and again this morning (3/22) from
6 - 10 am
, this time
with a "calf" or smaller whale
, in the same location.

Baja Pilot whales
: Just wanted to let you know that I just saw
two Pilot Whales
about 200 yards off shore on the
Eastern side of Baja California Mexico
near the small town of Puertocitas. I did not get any pictures, but they were here for about a half hour feeding in the shallow areas off shore. It looked like a mom and calf as one was much larger than the other. This is my first morning here and this was quite a treat.
