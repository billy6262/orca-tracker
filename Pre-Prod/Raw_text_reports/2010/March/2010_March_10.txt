============================================================

Entry 1:
We left
Transient orca T87
just off of Halibut Is.,
N. Haro St.
at

4:45
heading toward Mandarte Is. going NW. I guess there were other Ts being heard on the hydrophones as we came in, but he was the only one that we were able to spot. We had found him a half an hour earlier just north of Kelp Reef.
