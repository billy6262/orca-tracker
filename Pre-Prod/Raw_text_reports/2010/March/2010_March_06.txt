Orca Sightings for March 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The photo is of the feeding pits on our beach (
Mabana Beach, Camano Isl
) at a 0.2 tide, after
three days in a row
of
grays
feeding (per the Wiedmans). Again, I missed the actual whales. Some of the feeding pits were so fresh that the water in them was still muddy, and the gulls were busy feeding on the left-overs.

I saw
2 Gray Whales
this morning at
0700
swimming close to shore (within maybe 100' or so). Location: West side of Whidbey Island, several miles
north of Oak Harbor
, on the west side (and within 100') of Polnell Point.

We had
two Gray whales
milling just off the point at
Beverly Beach
in the
evening
. They were not going anywhere fast and the sighting started just after sunset until dark. Mostly they did short shallow dives. Twice they dived deeper with the tail fluke clearly out of the water as they dived. There wasn't an obvious direction of movement and they were not feeding at the time. They stayed in an area I know to be between 90 and 120 ft deep. Both whales appeared to be adults, though one was slightly smaller than the other. Toward the end of the sighting they had moved about half a mile towards Baby Island / Millionaire's Cove.
