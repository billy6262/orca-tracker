Orca Sightings for March 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:55 PM
- I just heard
gray whales
blowing off East Point, at Whidbey Shores,
Saratoga Passage
in the dark, below my balcony and close to shore. It sounded like more than one and they were heading south.
Christi Shaffer, Whidbey Island
