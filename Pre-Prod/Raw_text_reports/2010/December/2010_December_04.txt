Orca Sightings for December 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC for passing along this report: On a sail down the Big Sur Coast we saw a pod of
killer whales
, at least five, heading North about three miles off shore just north of
San Simeon CA
off Pfeiffer point. Below is the entry from the log: "The rest of the day was a very brisk sail under double reefed main and furled jib, 35 knot winds with the Garmin registering up to 8.3 knots, and averaging over 6 knots, a very satisfying speed for such a small boat. In route we saw a pod of killer whales heading North in search of prey, their distinctive dorsal fins resembled black submarine conning towers. They paid no attention to Milagro."
