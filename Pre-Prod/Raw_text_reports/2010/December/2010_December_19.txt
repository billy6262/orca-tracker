Orca Sightings for December 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Are you able to identify this
whale
(photo)(gray?, or humpback?)? We saw it off the north shore of
Alki
in West Seattle at about

4:15pm
. The whale was heading west ward and surfaced/blew 3 times (twice, then it was down for awhile, then once more before the boat ).

Though we think from this photo it looks like it could possibly be a Humpback whale, John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research writes, "I would put it as too difficult to tell. Hopefully better photo by someone else."
