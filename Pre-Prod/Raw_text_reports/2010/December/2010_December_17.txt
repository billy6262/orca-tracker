Orca Sightings for December 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I began hearing calls at about

7:30 pm
on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
. They were intermittent, faint, and only a couple different calls. At first I thought it was transients, then I began to think it was Residents. After listening to the recording the next day, I believe it was Residents. I sent Scott a clip for verification of the loudest of the calls which I believe it were S4 calls, commonly used by J Pod. I posted it on my blog with a few more details.
