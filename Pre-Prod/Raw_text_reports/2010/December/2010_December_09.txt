Orca Sightings for December 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dec. 9 I broke away from chores long enough to take David Ellifrit, from the Center For Whale Research, and Jeanne Hyde (check out Jeanne Hyde's great Blog) out looking for a reported Transient Orca. It had been two hrs. since the report, but we went anyway. With help from the Center, we headed toward Kelp Reef, over on the BC side of Haro Strait. After about a half an hour we spotted blows and found T63, nicknamed Chainsaw because of the ragged nicks in his dorsal. T 63 was there along with an amazing rainbow (see photo of the day, above) as we looked back toward San Juan Island. We left them about a mile outside of Baynes Ch. headed S. toward Victoria, BC, at
3:30. Cheers, Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's San Juan Charters John Rogstad of Washington State Ferries called to report

Debbie Sharpe at the Center for Whale Research called Orca Network at

to relay a report from Lisa Lamb on
Stuart Island
of some Dall's porpoises along with
at least one orca
, heading south from the south side of Stuart Island. Dave Ellifrit might get out to get an ID if possible.

I made contact with
4 Transients
(1 male, 2 females and 1 juvenile) at 48 17.295N and 123 31.417W. I spotted the T's porpoising into the ebb tide at around
1235
, and left them at 1330 a few miles to the SE of
Race Rocks
