About
2 pm
on Maya's Westside Charters we headed out to see
J pod, K pod and Onyx L-87
as they were heading back in, passing the
Victoria
Waterfront, heading toward Discovery Island. We met them at about
3p.m
. They were somewhat in groupings but with the rough seas it was difficult to tell who was with who. Pics being sent to CWR for verification. We left them at about
3:45 as they continued to head northeast toward San Juan Island. At about
5:00 p.m. faint
calls
began over the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
and grew louder until it sounded as if they were very close to shore going north. They faded out and then began being heard at about
6:40 pm. the volume of the calls grew to almost 'ear piercing' for several minutes and then faded out. more on my blog.
