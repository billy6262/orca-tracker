Orca Sightings for December 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Clipper IV stopped to view southern residents west bound off
Victoria
.
J's and K's with L87
came south through Oak Bay the morning of
December 1st and headed west across Victoria's waterfront.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reports that Mark Malleson saw
Southern Resident orca
s at
9 am
this morning heading south down Baynes Channel, past Oak Bay, just east of
Victoria
, then out toward Race Rocks, heading west.
*
I began hearing faint sounds on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
, starting between
8 and
8:15 a.m
. and concluded at about

8:45 a.m.
that it definitely was whales. I finally saw a whale when one breached off the south end of Discovery Island. That was at about
9:50 a.m. A bit more of the brief encounter on my blog.

UPDATES FROM CASCADIA RESARCH:
11 am:
We just got a report of the whale in
Totten Inlet, heading into Oyster Bay
. I've sent out a couple of our volunteers with one of our cameras to see if they can find it and hopefully get some good photos, but given the heavy fog down here I'm not sure how successful they'll be.
1 pm:
Our volunteers found the whale. It appears to be a large whale (larger than a minke), with a prominent dorsal fin posterior to the injury site. John (Calambokidis) is going to launch a boat from Boston Harbor to go out and get a better look and hopefully a species ID.

LATEST REPORT from John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research:
6:11 pm: I am just back from our survey. We found the whale and got some good photographs even though it was surfacing fairly erratically and we only had a little over an hour of good light. Species is not certain but I think
most likely a sei whale
based on the somewhat rounded rostrum and what little we can see of the dorsal fin that looks fairly erect. The head shot
*
(only one series) does not appear to show the rostral ridges of a Brydes whale but that would be the other possible species this could be. Does not show much of its back or dorsal fin probably due to the severe injury. The injury
appears to be boat strike
related most likely from a twin screw vessel (or two separate collisions). The less severe injury (forward) shows clear indications of being a propeller. The more severe injury is deep, crosses the spinal process and appears deep enough to be down to the spinal process. Hard to imagine this is survivable for very long given that it cuts across the back this deeply. We will keep monitoring this whale but feel we need to start preparing for a possible mortality.
