We have only seen
Orcas
a handful of times during the 30 years we have lived here, and we saw some this morning at

10:30-
10:50 am
. They were traveling north up Hale Passage, on the east side of
Lummi Island
(approx. 48oN 44', and 123oW 41'). They went further north than Pt. Migley in the direction of Sandy Pt. and then seemed to head west. We saw 4 whales, and one of them had a massive, straight dorsal fin. They were surfaced frequently in short rolls as they traveled.
