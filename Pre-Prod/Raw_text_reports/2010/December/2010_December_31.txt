Orca Sightings for December 31, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Shlomo Pekar called Orca Network to report a sighting of
two orcas
about ten miles off
Newport Oregon
, at
2 pm
. The coordinates were N44 34 643 by W124 14 910. He said one was big and the other small, and they were heading south.

This happened on New Year's Eve just south of
Carmel, CA
- visible from the shore. I'm used to seeing grey whale spouts etc. at this time of year heading south, but spotted something more as I was riding my motorcycle down Highway 1 on NYE, so I pulled over to check it out. Still not sure what I saw - was it
one grey whale or two?
- was the pod of dolphins friend or foe? - did the whale (or whales) spend a lot of time on their backs with their bellies at the surface?

We sent out Tim's report and photos to our list of coastal researchers, and received the following replies:
DEFINITELY
two gray whales
here (surrounded by Risso's dolphins). They look like two adults. In one shot, you can see that one is upside down (underside of throat with pleats showing), and the other one's head is right next to it (underside of throat shows - slightly turned toward the whale in the foreground). The image that shows ones head/body and the other's fluke-up: neither gray whale is a calf. I would say that this was social interaction/rolling/courtship; the most likely time to get approaches by dolphin. "Peeping Toms"! Maybe this will result in a calf for next year - good times!!

this looks like 2 grays to me.

It looks like a mother and juvenile gray whale to me.
