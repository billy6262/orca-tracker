Orca Sightings for December 8, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm not sure exactly what I saw - some type of
cetaceans
were following the wake of a big transport boat (carrying a small backhoe) heading up the sound from
Three Tree Point
area at

2:20 pm
. There was much splashing and the sprays were pretty big. The most activity occurred in the ferry lane off of
Vashon Island
. I never saw a definitive dorsal fin, but I did see flashes of white. Did anyone report orcas in that area on Wednesday,
December 8? I have see plenty of Dall's porpoises in this area off of Eagle Landing in the past, but I have never witnessed this kind of splashing and sprays in this part of the Sound.
