Orca Sightings for December 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband was at
Point Wilson Lighthouse
in the
morning
when he saw
two Orcas
not too far from shore. He also saw a sea lion jump out of the water as if he were scared to death trying to get away. After the Orcas disappeared he saw the sea lion floating on its back as if to be relaxing and wiping his brow saying pheeeew I escaped that threat. He was able to capture a picture of one of the whales dorsal fins. I have attached the one photo he was able to capture of one of the Orcas.

I saw
two orcas
just off the rocks at
Pt. Wilson
at
1015 am
. I also saw a sea lion torpedo out of the water in close proximity to the orcas. Very cool! Not sure if the orcas were transients - definitely 2 different animals. The sea lion escaped, as I saw it several more times.
