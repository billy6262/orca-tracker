Orca Sightings for December 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
1 possible orca calf (determined to be a
Bottlenose Dolphin
by the photo she sent, and confirmed by Cascadia Research - see below), sighted in the morning, between

8:00am and
11:00am
or so in the
Tacoma/Seattle
area - it has been here for the past week or so. No marks or injuries that I could see, but I thought I saw white on the tail the few times it crested and showed it's tail. Thanks,
Marlyss (and her Grandson Aaron)
Orca Network and our Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network also had received a call on Dec. 11th of what was reported and described as a dolphin in the same area, swimming back and forth close to shore. The call was referred to Cascadia Research.
