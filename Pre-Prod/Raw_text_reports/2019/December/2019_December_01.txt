Orca Sightings for December 1, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Sun Dec 1 - It's a new era in the Salish Sea, with killer whale sightings of both ecotypes occurring regularly through November. Today, the 1st of December, continued in the same vein with
members of at least six Bigg's killer whale matrilines in the area
today. We headed out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching and met up with the
T34s, T37Bs, and T99s today in Haro Strait
, complete with gorgeous wintery backgrounds. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

...could see Jeff Friedman on J1 slightly north of them. They gave Jeff a call to see if he was with anything, and he had just spotted a group of northbound Bigg's, which he later identified as the
T034s, T037B's, and the T099s
. Mike 1 started to work their way towards Jeff's group when Joe spotted more killer whales ~ 1.5 miles to the south, so they turned around and headed to them instead. At 1231 they came across a large slick from a kill at 48 23.4/123 11.7, which was likely where Gord had last seen them through the Big Eyes. At 1238 Mark and Joe started their encounter after confirming the
T035As, T036As, and T038As
along with an unidentified bull spread out and traveling east (48 22.2/123 10.7) 3.5 nm
SSE of Discovery Island
. Joe eventually was able to identify the bull as
CA137
, and later on in the encounter, Mark had spotted a trailing very cryptic female who was
CA040

Entry 3:
Hood Canal -
I was referred to you to report my sighting by friends on the Seattle Aquarium's Beach Naturalist facebook group, which I am a member of. Today at about
2pm
, I was birdwatching at
Potlatch Park in the Hood Canal
- and saw
a gray whale
. I was stunned, but we watched it surface and spout several times quite close to shore (50-100ft) as it continued moving south, and it's body was a pale gray, and it's spout a distinctive two-pronged shape. I know that they migrate through Washington waters but did not expect to see on so far south in Hood Canal, or this time of year! I only had my phone camera on me at the time and the whale was traveling south, not really hanging out, so I just focused on watching it as long as I could. I would say I'm about 90% sure it was a gray. I am not an expert but this is what makes me think it was a gray whale:
