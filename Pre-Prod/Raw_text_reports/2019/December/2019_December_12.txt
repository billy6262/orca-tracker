Entry 4:
12:40 from Edmonds
yesterday (Dec 12) and said they saw something larger than a harbor porpoise when nearing the dock in Kingston. We talked about the bottlenose sightings in recent months. The FKWs look bigger than what they described but thought it was worth mentioning. My daughter is an avid whale watcher and her friend recently changed her major from marine biology to chemistry-so they're no dummies in this area. -Jennifer Backen Matchem
