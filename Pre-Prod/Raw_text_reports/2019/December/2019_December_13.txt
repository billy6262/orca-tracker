Entry 2:
Bush Pt. On Whidbey Island
Lon Brocklehurst of Lab-core heard a
whale blow nearby about
4:30pm
. When he looked up he reports seeing
two false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens)
, one of them about 100 yards from the dock. They were traveling north about 1/4 mile apart, one larger than the other. This is a highly unusual sighting and we don't have any photos but he knows his whales and is a reliable observer. If anyone else saw or heard anything like that please let us know here.
