Orca Sightings for December 22, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Sun Dec 22 - Dave Ellifrit was on the water with Transients: ...Dave gathered up his warm clothing, headed to Snug Harbor, and left in the boat at 1115. Several other boats were also out looking for the whales reported and we all coordinated in our search of the area we thought they may have gone. "J2" eventually found the whales, ID'd as the
T34s and T37s, heading northeast up President Channel
. Dave eventually caught up and the encounter began at 1240 about a mile or so off Pt. Doughty on Orcas Island...
Little one T34A1...

HUMPBACK WHALES

Entry 2:
22:39-

22:54 - Haro Strait. Loud vocalizations and exhalations very close to shore
moving to the north between northern edge Hannah Hts and Edwards Point - 10 separate vocalizations lasted between 2-3 seconds, very close to shore, elephant-like trumpeting, reedy "twirling" sounds as the whale broke the surface. I heard the first call from inside my house. Running outside to listen as the whale north moved towards Edwards Point. I turned on the LK hydrophone. First faint call heard at
11:10pm getting loud as the whale passed.
Last call heard at
11:24pm
. (The calls lasted 14 minutes. I am attaching a 4 minute sample). -Michelline Halliday, SJI

We continue to be astounded by how rapidly the Salish Sea is changing. Here we are near the end of December and today there were
at least five different groups of Bigg's (transient) killer whales, a large group of Southern Resident killer whales, and over a dozen humpbacks reported in the region
. The humpback whales are perhaps the most amazing of all, as this is very late in the season for any of them to be here, let alone so many of them! Most of the whales have departed for their breeding grounds in Hawaii or Mexico, but as the population continues to grow, it's likely some non-breeders will hang out for more of the year in the feeding grounds, including the Salish Sea.
Yesterday we got out on the water and saw
about a dozen humpbacks in a very active group in the Strait of Georgia
. It's awesome to have so many naturalists in the region dedicated to getting to know the Salish Sea humpbacks on an individual level, alongside the orcas. Thanks to their help, we know the
humpback whales Coon, Nike, Mensa, Cassiopeia, Gibbous, Pulteney, Windy, and Bullet were all present.
Then this evening (likely multiple) humpbacks were singing in Haro Strait as heard over the Lime Kiln hydrophone. In case you missed it here's a link to a sample on our Soundcloud. -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI

18:40 -
Ship came through drowned out the whales...once again hearing faint/distant vocals through waning ship noise.

18:14 -
Whales went quiet cople minutes, started up again. Loud.

18:12 - Still hearing them
...just beside myself, this is so beautiful, whales have been loud and clear entire time...now loud tanker ship noise audible.

17:17 - I had been listening to Lime Kiln hydrophone
in hopes any of the orcas seen around earlier might mosey by the node... when suddenly around

17:17 I start hearing Humpbacks singing, vocalizing, trumpeting!

Entry 3:
15:00 - Three humpbacks and a small herd of white-sided dolphins
:
3:00 PM, three humpback whales first observed from boat 1/2 kilometre
west side of Active Pass
. A single, half way across Trincomali Channel and a pair just offshore of Active Pass.
the white-sided dolphins (about seven) were just coming out of Active Pass (west side)
just before whale sightings. The
pair of humpbacks were heading down Swanson Channel
past North Pender.
This humpback, which sadly is the case with large percentage of humpbacks, shows scarring consistent with having been entangled in line at some point. Fluke of humpback known as Solar! IDs designations: Marine Education Research Society:
MERS- BCYuk2017#5, Cascadia Research: CRC-16585, Happy Whale: HW-MN0510098
