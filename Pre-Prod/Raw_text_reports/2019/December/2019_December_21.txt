Orca Sightings for December 21, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
humpback whales
in the Salish Sea on the winter solstice is remarkable enough. Up that to seeing a dozen of them in what sure looked like a rowdy group, and you're in epic territory. Typically this kind of behavior, with lunging and ramming, tail throwing, trumpeting, and breaching is only seen on the breeding grounds. But typically they're at or on their way to the breeding grounds by now! Yet another example of the rapidly changing ecosystem here, and incredible to witness. Thank you Jeff and Sara! -Monika Wieland Shields

Sat Dec 21 - While our primary focus is orcas, we of course enjoy and document all cetacean species in the Salish Sea. Last weekend while out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching when we had our memorable
humpback
whale encounter in the
Strait of Georgia
, we also documented some whales that are known from much further north in British Columbia. In particular, it was cool to learn from Marine Education & Research Society that this was the first time
BCZ0297 Pulteney
was documented this far south! Connections like this are what we are all about. We are all citizen scientists on the water, observing so much more than any one research group could ever document. It is through sharing and collaboration that we all learn more about these incredible whale neighbors of ours! -Monika Wieland Shields
