Orca Sightings for December 18, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
04:15 -
I just began to hear calls on our
Bush Pt Whidbey Island hydrophone
! A superpod was off Victoria Tuesday, hope it is all or some of J, K and L pods!...listened for another two hours and didn't hear more calls. Didn't hear enough to 100% confirm as Southern Residents, but definite orca calls for the short time I heard them. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Entry 2:
L87 Onyx travels alongside L82 Kasatka as they pass Point Robinson,Vashon Island

Entry 3:
(
ID by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research
)
*

Entry 4:
Js, Ks, & most of L pod
- Brad Hanson confirms they saw
members of all three pods
, but they were really spread out didn't get a chance to ID everyone so may not have complete picture since priority was trying to get fecal and prey sample samples. He said residents were out there killing a lot of fish and that researcher Mark Sears got some scale samples, they some prey samples. All in all a good day out there.

15:45 -
I was viewing the pod from

2:11-
3:45. The
Pod of 10+
was very active and spread out in smaller groups. They seemed to be moving at a slower speed
circling Commencement Bay and Quartermaster Harbor
with the bull males leading the way, with a NOAA boat behind them. After a while they all seemed to meet back up greeting each other. The whole Pod went under water for a few minutes, coming back up they formed a line and headed back on course...It was around
3:30 when they met back together then headed north again. -Desiree Sauve

15:28 -
I'm in between
Commencement Bay and the mouth of Quartermaster Harbor and there are SO many orcas
here today. Huge breaches at Browns Point with a group of 9-12. But they are in every direction I look. Has anyone counted how many are around today? -Melissa Mallott

20 or more with binoculars from Dash Point Pier.
They were spread out and collectively heading north past tip of Maury towards Des Moines at a fast clip. -Anika Blake

There were
at least 2 deep in Commencement Bay off the Husky Terminal

Hi there! On 12/18, I got lucky and witnessed members of
all three SRKW pods from Point Robinson on Vashon
! It was hard to know where to look, as there were so many whales! Everyone seemed very relaxed and very few breaches or skyhops given the number of whales. At the end of the video, you'll see a little baby! (I think J56?) Thanks for all you do! -Grace McRae

So blessed to see the resident orcas. I managed to get 3 photos from
3 Tree Point
, but just being in their presence is all I needed, and feeling them, and that there are an abundant amount of salmon out there. Had these few (
J16s
per Melisa Pinnow, CWR) pass by close but most were on the Vashon side as they headed south towards Tacoma. I am going to time this encounter for future use. Yeomalt
