Orca Sightings for December 8, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:09 - Seeing 4 to 5 orcas east of Eglon
in the shipping lane. Heading straight East. -Austin Iles
(Sara Hysong-Shimazu & Kersti Muul both viewed a posted video and think they look and act like Bigg's Transients. Video too distant to confirm IDs - alb)
*

11:47 - Orcas
. We saw 5 (one baby I think) they appeared to be fishing and just now started to head north a bit. They were close to the shore, but moved out a bit.

10:38 - Orcas off Eglon
!! Just 1/2 mile from Eglon boat launch. -Gail Turner Wicklein

Eglon
and I see
at least three orcas
, 2 adults 1 little one, on the Kitsap side...milling around. Follow up: I couldn't tell I think they moved closer to the middle of the inlet. -Melissa Peterson

Entry 2:
Hood Canal -

12:34 -
I believe I just saw a nice big fin (dorsal) in Anna's Bay on Hood Canal. Anybody else? Dorsal. In water a ways away from me. Maybe 3 feet. I am looking from above so don't have great perspective. I have seen a gray in Hood Canal but, it was 30 years ago. Too shallow right here for grays I think. I have lived on Whidbey, San Juan and Lopez and been lucky enough to see them in my life many times. There is a huge population of seals right now here at the mouth of the Skokomish River. All things being equal I would love to see a few orcas hang here for a while in the interest of population control. -Andrea Love
(We explained a gray whale was seen in Hood Canal last week and that they feed in the shallows, but still uncertain what species she saw - alb)
