Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (Dec 19 Puget Sound) -
Js, Ks, & Ls Puget Sound
- Audio reports -
Bush Point hydrophone
(w/ some Port Townsend)

23:00PST
- It is 2 am EST and quite a lot of activity....I was
listening to Bush Point
when i heard activity. I heard an orca but then some other sounds i didnt recognize. I tried recording it on my cell, so can try posting that here. I was checking both out, but am sure I caught the activity on Bush Point. -Andi G CB (posted on Orcasound - Listen for Whales Facebook page)

16:00 -
We're still at about 2.5 knot ebb tide... But I can't remember if Fred Felleman's thesis suggested the SRKWs often turned at the slack or the peak in Haro. (Still no calls on PT hydrophones.) Fred said: SRKWs are 7x more likely to change direction within an hour of slack. (Pg. 56 of UW Master's thesis...)

15:35 -
FYI there's a nasty looking container ship bound for the Port of Tacoma that's about to clear Point Wilson, so we're probably going to lose acoustic sensitivity in Admiralty Inlet in ~15-30 min...

15:30 - Still hearing them on Bush Point too,
but fainter than ~15 minutes ago. So maybe they are stalled off north Marrowstone?

15:29 - Starting to hear calls at Port Townsend
more consistently, despite rattling flow noise from the ebb current... so maybe some continued northwest? Or it could be they are stalled and I'm only hearing them because the ferry/ship noise is lower at PT now...

15:11 -
With fishing vessel and ferry noise down, we're again
hearing SRKW calls

14:40 -
BTW, the ebb tide is running fast so there's some flow noise at Port Townsend but we've heard a few faint calls...Scott Veirs, Orca Sound & Beam Reach

Bush Point hydrophone

15:09 - Hearing calls again on Bush Point

3:09. Some sound closer but most sound faint and inconsistent.

-Meg Sellers

15:51 -

16:00 - Resdients still audible
but horrible tanker noise...turned off at ~
16:00.

15:20 - S1 calls
.

14:30 -
and still hearing many vocals on
Bush Point Js plus
. Wonder if some have stalled and/or if some might turn back. Js have flipped back in Admiralty a lot this fall...boat noise now....maybe the Ursa Major NB @ 10.3kn

14:08 -
So excellent!
14:08 and still
hearing them quite well on Bush Point
. Maybe trailers passing by or some stalled and/or turned back? (Though visuals have at least leaders/some still NB as far as we can tell)

13:44 - Calls still faintly audible on Bush Point hydrophone
.

13:37 - Members of all three pods heard on Bush Point hps
.

13:00 - Yay! Loud and clear calls on Bush Point hydrophone
, confirmes residents! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

14:30 - With visibility deteriorating we left Lagoon Point northerly viewpoint after seeing one fin mid-channel northbound, and still
hearing frequent vocalizations, loud and clear, on the Bush Point hydrophone
. Like Marilyn Armbruster, lleft wondering if some may have turned back south. -Sandra Pollard
*

13:40 - Group of orcas passing Lagoon Pt steady northbound.

12:45 -
13:30 had at least 15 to 20 pass close to Bush PT Shore
. At that point they started veering more northwesterly. After Lagoon point I stopped at little lookout on Ledgewood beach. Didn't see them but the could have easily been more over towards ft Flagler or be nice if they turned back. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

13:58 - Orcas
. We're leaving
Lagoon Point. There was one group mid-channel off the point. Others are north of there.
Forts Flagler & Casey, Port Townsend viewpoints & the PT-Coupeville ferry could all be good spots soon.

13:20 - More passing Bush Point
. Several groups of 3-4 orcas. Maybe 15 or so.

12:59 - A lead orca just passed Bush Point heading northbound
. Not far off the Whidbey side. -John Scanlon
*

13:05-

13:15 - Pod of 7 or 8 Orcas
going from south to north at

1:05 -
1:15 PM today. -Ken LaForce

12.50 passing Bush Point
...Wet and wild - but what's a bit of wind and rain when Southern Resident orcas are heading your way? When the going gets tough, the tough get going...Together with intrepid fellow Orca Dork Marilyn Armbruster we braved the elements in the early afternoon of
December 19 to await the arrival of the whales at Bush Point, Whidbey Island, following Orca Network reports that they were northbound in Admiralty Inlet. We were not disappointed...Despite being buffeted by a bracing breeze as we scanned the whitecaps we stood our ground, and soon spotted rising dorsal fins and blows breaking the crests of the waves. In no time at all
15-20 whales powered past the Whidbey shoreline
breaking their dynamic rhythm briefly with tail-slaps, spy-hops and one or two short directional changes by a couple of the orcas in pursuit of prey.
Listening to their loud, clear vocalizations on the Bush Point hydrophone
in tandem with their travels gave a surreal edge to the encounter leaving us feeling as though, just for a while, we were part of their mysterious watery world. To quote Marilyn, we were 'in the moment.' And what a moment it was.

12:47 - 15-20 orcas are bunched up less than a mile from the Whidbey side off north side of Mutiny Bay
, much surface socializing, many tail lobs, spy hops, mostly non-directional but still trending northward.

12:03 - Orca fins and blows off Mutiny Bay or Useless Bay, steady northbound mid channel
. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

12:45 - Orcas just south of Bush PT 1/2 mile or so mid or closer to Whidbey northbound.
Noon - Viewing from Shore Meadows, orcas in line with Hansville
maybe mid channel or closer to Kitsap northbound. -Marilyn Armbruster
*
Noon - Orcas.
I left about 15 minutes ago but they were
still trending north
. I saw at least 7 blows. If they continued they should be visible from Bush Pt soon. And I'd try the new hydrophone to see if anyone is talking!!

11:28 - Group of orcas off Double Bluff!
Big breach and multiple blows. Looks like they're continuing NB. Far off for me-viewing from Pt. No Pt.!! -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network
*

09:25 - Orca -
seeing several with foraging activity - close to Eglon. Presumably still trending NB. Large male and smaller - juvenile maybe. It's a bit choppy out there. They were hanging out just a bit south of Eglon last time I looked. I think PNP would be a good bet.

09:15 - Orca.
Seeing at least one in the shipping Lane, also
northbound
.

08:59 - Seeing a large orca male northbound off Apple Tree Point
, close to Kitsap side! -Sara Frey
*

08:55 -
Maija with WS Ferries Marine Operations called to report
3-5 orcas north of Kingston in the southbound traffic lanes
. No direction of travel provided at the time reported to Ops.
*

08:45 - Northbound off of Kingston
at
8:45am. Two individuals spotted. So much for my ferry boat nap! -Back of camera photo by Paul Dudley Mooselips, Dec 19, 2019
