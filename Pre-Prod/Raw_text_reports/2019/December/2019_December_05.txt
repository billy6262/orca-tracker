Orca Sightings for December 5, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
CA Coast -

15:15 - Orcas:
I arrived too late to see the show - just saw three spouting as they sped off into the distance. Apparently there were 5 confirmed (one swam under my buddy as he sat in the water surfing - he got out right away - haha) as they breached and swam just offshore of Virgin Creek Beach just
north of Fort Bragg CA
. We watched them as they sped off towards Laguna Point just north of Virgin Creek. Hope this can help....Follow up: Apparently, the Orcas doing their show ten minutes before that. I saw the spouts about 300 yrs out. No fins. One friend got a video with iPhone...of them frolicking. We ran back to car to hopefully intercept them at Laguna Point - the next point north. Ran into folks that had binoculars and saw them before we got there. But we never saw spouts or them after Virgin Creek...Cheers, Robert Jamgochian
