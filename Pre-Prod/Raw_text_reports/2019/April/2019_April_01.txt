Have you heard
j pod
in the dark? Get to Ruben tarte (

I'm on the
1945 hrs ferry from FH to Anacortes and saw a pod
.. it was almost dark, so I couldn't get photos.... at least five orcas... very active! -Dena Royal

19:20 - J Pod westbound in Upright Channel
. -Monika Wieland Shields

18:30-45 - 4-8 orcas
, Feeding, Leaping, breaching, feeling. Headed south from channel to
West of Jones island
. Sighted from Sunset Cove Orcas island. -Amy Starkovich

...They eventually decided to head back west through
Upright Channel
, but amazingly they hugged the Shaw Island shoreline so close they went inside of Canoe Island and right into Indian Cove, a channel not only narrow, but according to the chart on board only 13 feet deep on high tide! It was time to head in, but we had to stay long enough to see if they were actually going to go all the way through there....they did!...Excerpt from latest blog post which includes 2 encounter reports & many images at:
March 26 and
April 1 with
J-Pod. J27 Blackberry in front of Friday Harbor this evening. A "rainblow" from L87 Onyx in Upright Channel on Monday evening.

While I don't get to see the close in-the-kelp passes like at Lime Kiln, there is something so special and exciting about being able to run down the hill from my house and see
J Pod in San Juan Channel
. I still can't believe I live in a place where that's even possible. I'm a lucky girl. -Cindy Hanson, Orca Network (
all of J pod was present per Sara Hysong-Shimazu - alb
)
