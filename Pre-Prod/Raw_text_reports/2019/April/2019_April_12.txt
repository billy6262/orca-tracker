Orca Sightings for April 12, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fri Apr 12 - Anacortes: Shortly after leaving the dock we got a report from a someone that had been on the ferry three hours earlier that saw
a male orca traveling near Anacortes
. With no other information and a lead that was already hours old, we knew we'd have our work cut out for us, but Captain Scott went with his gut and made a turn to the north in Rosario Strait. Lucky for us, his hunch was correct, because shortly after stopping near Peapod Rocks to view some harbor seals, we spotted the whale! This lone male turned out to be
T77A, an adult born in 1996
. We traveled west
past Sinclair Island toward the south end of Lummi
and surprised us with at least one nice close pass as he checked us out! We got a lot of quality time with him as the only boat on scene! We decided to do some exploring and headed up toward Sandy Point in search of other wildlife. We found some juvenile bald eagles, surf scoters, and a turkey vulture, then it was time to travel back to the south, completing a circumnavigation of Lummi Island. Our whale, T77A, was was still in the area, so we got to spend a few more moments with him before heading back to Anacortes. -- Erin, Island Adventures

I saw what appeared to be a
lone gray whale
off the beach just north of Intalco pier at
Cherry Point, north of Bellingham
...It looked to be feeding, taking a few pretty short breathes and then 7-10 minute dives. I'd never seen one from shore up there. -Bea Acland
