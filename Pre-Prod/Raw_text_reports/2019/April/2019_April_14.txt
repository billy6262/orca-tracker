Orca Sightings for April 14, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
14th day in a roll/on a roll of multiple grays between Strawberry & Polnell Pts. on Whidbey side
with Mariners' Cove right smack in the middle and Brown & Rocky Pts. on Camano side with Utsalady Bay in the middle. (Skagit Bay/Most Northern Saratoga Passage) area. Highlights, on Friday evening while kayaking were up to 5 grays on a brief meetup/encounter? and/or feeding session in deeper water off Camp Grande' Rocky Pt. Certainly, not on ghost shrimp. Usual suspects have been a trio with 2 together and 1 outlier. Although, one sunset, all 3 were feeding close together at Polnell Pt.
Today, a single whale fed for an hour close in off
Mariners' Cove Stoney Beach around
6:15AM
. Swirling, pausing to let off some steam with spouts 75' from shore. Coming back later, not sure if same one; for another hour until noon. A Whale Touring Boat was waved down to capture some time with single gray out further mid channel. This has been a special spring for gray whales. Evidently, dining at the above area restaurants is pretty good in these waters this year. -Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor

Karen Graham called and reports they are watching a
gray whale directly out from Portico restaurant (Langley, Whidbey waterfront)
. We just saw him briefly, about 100 yards off shore at the most. No photos.

Today we went out on the Red Head (Puget Sound Express) today with the Susan, Howard, Cindy, Bonnie and the gang. It started off pouring, then in typical Sound fashion, we had a break in the weather and had a nice time with
531 and 383
. Lots of fluking, rolls, and feeding. Another amazing day! -David and Meliss Haeckel

Grays now rolling in close to shore to feed with fluke and pectoral fin out of the water.

We're with
#531 and #383 off Camano across from Langley
and about a mile north. They're traveling north fast with a couple of high flukes. Seen on the Orca Network benefit cruise aboard the Redhead.
On Sunday's Orca Network benefit whale watch aboard the Puget Sound Express from Langley we saw
gray whales #383 and #531
(pictured) along the shores of Camano and Bell's Beach on Whidbey Island, within 2-3 miles from Langley. They traveled fast to the north, then began feeding close to shore as we watched from a few hundred yards out. -Photos by Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Apr 14, 2019
