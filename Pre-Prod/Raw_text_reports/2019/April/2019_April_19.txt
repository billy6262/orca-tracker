Entry 2:
Everett PM
- The rain began to ease up a bit in the afternoon. Just 20 minutes into the tour, we spotted a pair of whales. It was our old friend
#383 and a new arrival, #356
! This is the
first time this year that #356 has been sighted
- exciting! These whales gave us very close pass showing off their large tail flukes. We saw another
whale far up into the delta
feeding - too shallow for us to visit. On the way home, much to our surprise, there was a
gray whale feeding right in front of our dock off Jetty Island
! What a fun day! -Erin and Renee, Island Adventures

Everett AM -
It wasn't long into our tour that we spotted our first whale. This whale was feeding in the shallows and not being very photogenic but we were able to snap enough of a shot to confirm this whale as
#2246
. We continued on to find a pair of whales swimming very close to each other. As we watched, we ID'ed one as
#49 "Patch"
and the other as one of our favorites,
#383
. #383 decided to do some people-watching and spyhopped repeatedly as he checked us out. As we headed back, we spotted two more spouts, one belonged to #383 and the other belonged to
#22, "Earhart"
, one of the few females in the Puget Sound gray whale population. -Erin and Renee - See Reports & images at Island Adventures Blog Post
