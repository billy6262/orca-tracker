Orca Sightings for April 30, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
a gray seen off Eagle Pt
. earlier in the day. The first two image sets were as the gray whale came up island, within a 1/4 mile from shore, just south of
Lime Kiln Pt. State Park
. The third image set I took from
County Park
where it was closer to shore. These were also sent to Cascadia Research. -Thanks, Jeanne Hyde

Hey all, On 4/30 I was at
Deadman's Bay
on San Juan Island when
a gray whale
swam by heading south. I jumped in my car and drove to the Land Bank where I was able to snap some photos. The animal didn't appear to be fully grown and was definitely emaciated. It never arched so I wasn't able to get a good flank ID; this is the most identifiable image I was able to get. Gray whale Haro Strait off Land Bank, west side San Juan Island. -Have fun, Adam U
*

Entry 2:
Rosario Strait - Interspecies association between gray whale and humpback!
-(See Island Adventures encounter report on these two in the Humpback section)
*
Encounter with
Humpback Pop Tart (2016 calf of BCY0324) on the left and a gray whale on the right in Rosario Strait

Entry 3:
12:45 - At Rocky Point (W Whidbey)
. Three days in a row now that I have been lucky to spot another whale on the ocean. This time it clearly looked to be colored
gray
. Also this time I can see more of it's body and this guy is gigantic. I am quite sure he is all alone and stayed in the same area for a couple hours. -Karina Mitchell

I only noted the times today. We've seen
one gray
(reported as orca, video shows gray -alb) this morning 4/30/19 between

7:45-
8:30
, swimming back and forth. Believed to be an orca because of the blowhole (not heart shaped like a gray) and movements in the water. It was swimming up and down (north and south, back and forth) in front of my home....This is
off Moran Beach SP
. -Stephanie Salem

Entry 4:
11:00 - Grays

10:20 - Three grays
, traveling southbound slowly
towards Everett
, mid channel, mid-island, east of Hat. -Lori Christopher

10:33 -
seeing blows and one fluke - under snowy Mt Baker-
east of Hat Island
from aboard MV Tokitae. Pretty day. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

Entry 7:

Tue Apr 30 - Rosario Strait....We searched deep into the Strait of Georgia before making the turn back south. As we entered Rosario Strait once again, we met up with
the gray whale
we'd found earlier, but now it had a friend! It was not another gray whale, but
a humpback whale
!!! The two were traveling side by side, and remained that way for the duration of our time with them. This is something the crew had never witnessed before. What an exciting opportunity to witness interspecies social behavior. -Nat Sam, Capt Scott, Naomi and Nick
*
Unknown
Gray whale and Humpback known as Pop Tart hanging out together

Entry 8:
Other notes by Sam:
These two were traveling side by side for at least two hours
today, and possibly longer after we left them. Both appeared to be mature individuals, just basing that off of relative size. The majority of the time they could have been touching pec fins beneath the surface, they were just that close to one another. Though they didn't cooperate for photos much (no great looks at flukes, and only two synchronized surfacings), it was a truly remarkable encounter to witness.

The
BCY0324 - calf 2016 known as Pop Tart, the humpback that was hanging out with the gray
was ID'd by Tasli as
Pop Tart
by this photo, It was the best fluke pic I could get. -Kristina Trowbridge
*
We saw a
grey whale and a humpback both together at Lawrence point

Entry 9:
*
UNCONFIRMED WHALES - Tue Apr 30 - South Puget Sound - I observed several spouts (3-5 ft high) from what appeared to be just
one whale (?)
; location was about half way
between Arcadia Point and Hope Island
. I could not ascertain the direction of travel, but the time was about
0900
. Thanks! I'll keep my eyes open for others. -Tom & Martha Fontaine
