UNCONFIRMED SPECIES - Wed Mar 3 - My daughter reports from the

11:30 a.m. Fauntleroy ferry
: "Headed north(?) like to the left as we were coming towards Fauntleroy. We didn't see any white on them. Just their fins and right below. They were about a little more than half way to Fauntleroy. They were not breaching and I don't know if the captain said anything bc we were in the car." I wonder if Dall's or the real deal?! -Bev McCullough
