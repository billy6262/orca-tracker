I was trapped in terrible traffic for 3 hours as I drove south, always one step behind the whales. With word they had rounded
Pt. Defiance southbound
, I raced to the Tacoma Narrows Park and hoped for the best. They came under the bridge fast, spread out, far away, long down times. But then, a group turned my way and the breaching began!
At least 3 individuals
joined in on the fun. Then they disappeared into thick heavy rain.

So awesome to see the transient pods that visited the south sound yesterday! Here are some pics from their visit as they swam
past Point Robinson.
Right as they rounded the Point, the sky opened up with a torrential downpour which made for some very challenging viewing and picture taking, albeit making it a pretty memorable encounter. Hearing their exhalations with the sound of rain bouncing off the water was magic. Worth it to be soaked to the bone to see them and their sweet young babies which are just about the cutest lil' munchkins ever! ~Marla Smith
