Orca Sightings for April 8, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Mon Apr 8 - Hi Alisa! (I am sending additional photos in another email.) 4-8-19 Haro Strait SJI. Observed and photographed from the shore. Between
10 am and 1pm I observed 13-15 orca traveling between the farthest west edge of Hannah Hts and Edwards Point
. They were moving slowly to the N/NW with one exception and that was
J26, Mike
. I was fortunate enough to watch J26 zig zag back and forth, very slowly, north to south and back again, for almost 2 hours. He dove for long periods of time; 2-3 minutes. He was stealthy and hardly made a splash. Sometimes I only saw his dorsal and he took a quick breath as he continued his hunt.

Entry 3:
20:00 -
This evening, in front of
Shilshole, Southbound. Pod of Orca
. Many juveniles, so I'm guessing transients? -Margaret Pommert
(
We believe this is the
T65As
. See framegrabs and video link below - alb
)
*

18:05 - Orca.
Can only see the male now through binocs. Line of sight: from
Marina Beach (Edmonds)
looking toward Discovery Park (West Pt lighthouse). More mainland side. Likely near or south of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park now.

17:55 - Orca. Steady SB. Between Pt. Wells and Kingston.
Long down times.

17:27 - Orca. Edmonds
side of mid channel, southbound. The 1730 ferry will have a great view if they surface again. -Ariel Yseth
*

14:48 - Orca.
Observed from bluff just
south of Bush Point
. Grouped up traveling at a good speed southwest towards Point No Point. Closer to Whidbey side, but possibly trending towards Kitsap side. Appears they made a kill earlier, closer to Bush Point based on gull activity and some milling when first seen. Appeared one got left behind because he/she was doing some full body porpoising to catch up to the main group. Observed a couple of half breaches when reunited. -Connie Bickerton
*

14:20 - Orca.
Just saw them southbound at

Port Townsend
) when we last saw them but we have lost sight of them.

11:06 -
Observing orcas in
Port Townsend Bay
from the S/V Carlyn! Two days in a row for us and our students. -Kelly Greenwood

10:35 -
We received a report (& video) from Cody Reddick showing pod of ~
6 Transient orcas off Fort Worden
, Port Townsend heading southbound just feet from shore!
(
We thought they looked like the T65As and asked Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research to review the video...her notes: "The family has the same makeup of the T65As but the male almost looks too big. Definitely transients though."
)

Entry 5:
*
Fri Mar 8 - Hi, We sighted
four Orcas here at Port Angeles
, WA during the Olympic Salmon Derby Friday
March 8, 2019. They were observed on the
outside of Ediz Hook
just off the entrance to the U.S. Coast Guard Station and north of the Ediz Hook boat launch area. They were moving very fast and disappeared quickly. We didn't get to see them for only less than a minute and they were gone. Other fishermen in the area saw them too. My employees and I will try to report sightings when possible in the future. We sample fishermen at the boat launches and are always around the water from Sekiu to Port Townsend and down to upper Hood Canal through the year. -Larry Bennett, WDFW
