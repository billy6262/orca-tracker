note re;
April 9th Puget Sound - The day started with an unidentified group southbound in the morning who by all accounts flipped just
south of Three Tree Point, Burien then continued northbound
on the east side of Vashon in main channel. About that time reports of others further south, so for a time there was some confusion if pod had split. What appears to be the case: the
T65As were already down south in Tacoma area while SB whales (later ID'd as T101s and T124As) were nearing Three Tree Point.
SB group continued north while T65As continued westbound Dalco Pass and headed north up Colvos Passage west side of Vashon exiting top of Vashon several miles trailing the T101s and T124As. Groups passing Kingston area ~ 90 minutes apart, both still northbound by evenings end. - alb

The 2nd pod is very, very loud....I could hear the whales breathing-blow hole air movement, in each of them. The whales were mid channel and it was as if they were right next to me. They've cleared north end of Vashon and are headed towards south end of Blake Island

(
Larkin Notes: I just reviewed the timing on the photos...my images were shot between 4 and 5.The pod definitely split as it passed Fay Bainbridge. The 2 boys ventured into the entrance to Port Madison Bay just a little bit, I think chasing food and may have been around for a while. 5 minutes prior to that I saw and have a few images of orcas moving north with a beautiful spyhop. They moved very quickly from Elliott Bay up to north Bainbridge. The images of the baby and mom were shot at
4:20pm...I was on the beach near my house,
just south of Faye Bainbridge. T124A3, T124A3 and her calf, T101B, T102
....so nice to see them closer to the Kitsap side on the way north...photographed from spots between Fay Bainbridge Park and Manitou Beach on Bainbridge.
