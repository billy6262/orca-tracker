Orca Sightings for April 17, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
19:15 -
I was looking out my window and saw an
orca
breach! I would not have believed it but then saw a tail pop up! (Red arrow is where it popped up). We headed down to the beach and saw
6-7 orca swimming near Hoods Head island, east side
. Mostly traveling southerly but stopped for a while, apparently feeding. We last spotted them traveling past "Nessie" and
toward the middle of the Hood Canal Bridge
. We watched them for about 20 minutes. One had a Very Large dorsal fin with a notch. One seemed quite small. We spotted them from the East side of Hood Canal. -BryAnn Bingham

14:00 - A pod of orcas
moved east from the straits (Juan de Fuca)
into Admiralty Inlet
between

1:30-2pm.
Looked to be 10 or so
individuals, two huge males traveling together, smaller males and a huge female not far away, then a smaller group nearby. The largest male had a big notch in his dorsal fin. One of the males came completely out of the water twice. They were tail slapping, occasionally milling for a short while - just having orca fun. Spent most of their time below the surface as they approached the light house at Point Wilson. -Annette Huenke, North Beach, Port Townsend
