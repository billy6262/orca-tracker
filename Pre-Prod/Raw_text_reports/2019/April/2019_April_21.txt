were traveling very close to the shore...They were heading north along the
shoreline of Orcas. We are between Doe Bay and Sea Acres

traveling north
very quickly along the Orcas shoreline which looks out on the Pea Pods. Could you please tell us who you think they were? I would love to think they were some of the SRKW....especially with that youngster. Thank you for all the work you are doing!!! -Ann Jones

Sun Apr 21 - San Juan Channel -As "Orcinus" was heading home from the J pod encounter and nearing Roche Harbor and the fuel dock, word came over the radio that "Sea Lion" found a group of transients in San Juan Channel.

1515 about halfway between O'Neal Island and Pt. Caution. The T65As were heading southeast
down San Juan Channel... Full report & images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 28.

Joe belong to a birding page that I'm also part of, and I saw him post a brief description of "special guests" along with some regular bird photos. I explained that the Grays are having a rough year and asked for any photos and continued monitoring of the situation. He treks from Bellingham to Semiahmoo Spit/Blaine, so I know he'll be on the lookout when near the water. Hope this helps with sightings, possible ID, etc. -Amanda Colbert
