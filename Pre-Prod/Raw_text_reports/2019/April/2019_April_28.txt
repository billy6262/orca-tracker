Orca Sightings for April 28, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
east side of Orcas
. I'm sure you heard about the sightings around
2 pm
with all the whale watch boats and a research vessel
as well in Rosario Strait at the Pea Pods
. I am reporting what
I believe to be J pod
going by,
heading north in Rosario Strait
right along the shoreline of Orcas Island around

5:30 -
6:00 pm
. They were spread out not evenly, travelling in small groups, breaching, rolling, tail slapping and swimming in circles. They were about 50 feet off shore. It was thrilling to say the least and it took quite a while for all of them to go by. We counted
about 20
. We are on the water
½ way between Sea Acres and Doe Bay
and look out at the Pea Pod rocks in Rosario Strait. The neighbors in Sea Acres tell me they circled a lot there. I so hope they are getting fish!!-Ann Jones

Just sighted
8 - 10 Orcas near Doe Island

4/28/2019 was another beautiful day spent in Puget Sound. We started our trip near Seattle with a group of Transient Killer Whales who turned out to be the
T100s
, not the T65As as I initially thought! ...(Gary Sutton: "That's where they went! Did you have the T167s too?") ...They were paralleling another group that was too far on the other side of the channel to ID. Is the T167s a group of 3 (no adult males)? If so, then it's possible! (GS: Yes, that's right. A female and her two kids. That's good to know. Thanks. Those Puget Sound sightings are always a gap in the data).
T100s - Puget Sound.

Entry 6:
~1815 - by Joseph State Whidbey Park. A spout

Entry 11:
09:40 -
Just saw a huge
humpback off McNeil Island
about
9:40am this morning...tried to grab my camera but too slow...so awesome!...Traveling toward the direction of University Place right off McNeil island...husband assumed it was humpback because it wasn't an Orca and it was bigger than our 32ft boat.
Did not see a dorsal fin
...it did a slow roll and the width of the body was enormous. Could it have been a different kind of whale in the south sound??...It's about 400 ft deep here. -Bette Sereia
