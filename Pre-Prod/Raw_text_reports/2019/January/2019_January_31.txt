Video reviewed confirmed
humpback off Edmonds waterfront
, presumabley same whale reported in Possession Sound in our last Whale Report - alb
)
*

Entry 7:
14:00 -
I spotted a
humpback
next to shore(!) at
Mukilteo Lighthouse
, heading south and away from shore, away from Lighthouse. I'm so glad it graced me, I was looking northbound for orcas and would've missed it had it not spouted directly behind me! -Alex Ho
(
Video sent to us by Alex shows
humpback
very close to dock pilings, diving, did not present fluke. Frame grab below - alb
)
*

12:43 - Humpack in Everett
. While conducting sediment research with ORCA students and Gravity Marine, a humpback surfaced off our starboard side and swam under the boat at
12:43, surfacing on the port side and headed towards the Naval base. Though we all have mental pictures (since our hands were full of equipment) you'll have to trust me that it was a juvenile humpback (and not a gray). -Ardi Kveven, Executive Director, ORCA
