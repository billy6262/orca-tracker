Last hour of the daylight spent at
Fox Spit
after spending all day searching for them, was headed to our destination sunset on west side when had heard the orcas were finally spotted on east side mid
Saratoga Passage
headed north. rushed back to the Passage and spent an incredible late afternoon/early evening last hour of daylight with the
T137s from Fox Spit
...waters, colors, glassy,calm, reflective, patterns, lines, textures, snowcaps...amazing! Grateful. Youngest family member,

At

16:00
we pulled up to bluff at
Bell's Beach
and see orcas strait out heading northbound passing Whidbey side mid channel. We immediately headed over to
Fox Spit and by
16:20
relocated the females/young to the south making directional changes in beautiful calm glassy seas. A few minutes later, approx.
16:25, we found
T137A
north and east of the others out toward mid channel ever so slowly wending his way towards us while the females/young were still further south milling around and disappearing on longer dives. We (Marilyn, I and group of hardy folks having a picnic in the freezing cold) were watching T137A when suddenly the rest of the
T137s
surfaced right off the spit at

16:30. T137 w/T137D
by her side surfaced very close inshore and
T137B
was few hundred feet out from them. T137A maintained his slow steady course further out and now trailing his family. AS they passed T137, T137D veered towards Baby Island, as T137 cleared the spit few minutes behind at
16:35. By
16:40 all were to the NW of us so we relocated to the Baby Island area and watched them briefly stalled out
between Fox Spit and Baby Island
before grouping up now more mid channel where they continued northbound very slowly. Sublime setting, perfectly Glassy calm seas, gorgeous sundown colors & lighting, vivid white snow-capped mountains. Perfect ending to a day of searching for orcas and taking in all the wonders including the two most excellent adorable sweet donkeys. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

16:00 -
Watched three orcas (one male) feeding
north of Pebble Beach
for 45 minutes. Tail slapping with blows...Couldn't tell if they were feeding on seals (we had a group of 6 yesterday) or fish, but there was a group of seagulls feeding on leftovers. They were first spotted at

3:10
just south of us, did their feeding north till about
4:00. -Peg Boley
