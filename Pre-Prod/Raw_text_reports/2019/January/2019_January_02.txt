Orca Sightings for January 2, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
two orcas this morning at about
7:45 slightly south of Richmond Beach in Shoreline
. They were hanging out pretty close to the shore, not heading in any particular direction....I was only a hundred or so feet away and had clear view of the dorsals which I'd say were closer to 3 feet in height, but I didn't see their backs at all so it's possible they were partially submerged. It looked like the dorsals were about the same size, though I believe one was slightly smaller than the other....What I saw were smooth and black without any ridges along the edge. They were moving around kind of back and forth, just not on a mission to get anywhere. -Thank you, Katie Wilson

after discussion of
possibly sea lions
Katie still think she saw orcas - alb
