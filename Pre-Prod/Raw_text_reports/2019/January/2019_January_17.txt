Orca Sightings for January 17, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
South Puget Sound - Seen on Gig Harbor Town talk at
1pm
: "A small pod of
orcas just came out of the burley lagoon
head out here in Purdy! Just a heads up if any of you are around the area. Keep a look out! Catch some pictures if ya can. I was too slow to shoot some pictures" We look out on Henderson Bay from high up, so I will look now with binoculars, though it's super choppy, so wish me luck! -Cora Reuter Foster

Thu Jan 17 - North Puget Sound - I was starting to get seriously concerned about my whale karma after failing to see any whales so far in 2019, despite a number of visits by both residents and transients to Puget Sound. It can start to get to you... After staking out Brighton Beach, Sandy Point and Langley following reports of whales heading into Saratoga Passage earlier (and along with Marilyn Armbruster seeing nothing) we made a last ditch attempt to spot them from
Fox Spit at around
3:30 pm
. Success! Initially it was a fleeting glimpse of a disappearing dorsal fin, but soon a tight group of
four/five orcas
surfaced mid-channel, including a calf (who I'm calling Dinky). With both wind and waves increasing, two of the whales turned southwards, milling briefly for a while, before the group picked up the pace and resumed their travels north in the company of an adult male. I feel much better now.
