K Pod
(as you are already aware I am sure from reportings) visited Vashon Island on Saturday
January 19. They came across Dilworth to
Port Robinson
after spending what seemed like an eternity feeding and romping off Dilworth as evidenced by all the very cold bystanders waiting for a glimpse of the Orca. Then zoom they moved at high speed around and past Point Robinson headed south. These photos are taken from Point Robinson...There were 50-60 people at Point Robinson viewing the Orca in all their splendor.
