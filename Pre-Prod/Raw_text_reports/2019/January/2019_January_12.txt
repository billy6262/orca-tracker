Entry 3:
K pod - Ken called Dave at home in the early afternoon to report that he was seeing whales heading south a little north of Beaumont Shoal. Since the whales were reported to be
K pod
, Dave grabbed his gear, headed for Snug Harbor, and left in "Orcinus" at
1455
. Dave arrived on scene about a half mile south of Trial Island at 1530. The whales were very spread out and traveling slowly west.
K21 and the K20s
were the first whales encountered...While
K25
did not look 100% healthy, neither did it look like his health worsened much since we last received really good photos of him from
October 12th. It is too early to say whether he will survive this latest health scare but it is encouraging that he has not deteriorated further since looking pretty bad back in September and may have actually improved some. Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 3.

Just Left

Entry 4:
Js rounded East Pt. into Georgia St
. this afternoon and
Ks were aiming west out Juan de Fuca. J17 and K25 both accounted for
, but but both still looking bad. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*
Sorry, I was unable to get any pictures. We ended up watching them for about 1.5 hours because they were so spread out, probably about 16 of them in total. 2 were moving quite slowly and were fairly far off from the rest of the pod, we watched them resting at the surface for some time so I wondered if that was J17.

11:16 -
looks like a few more still coming through. I'll try to get pictures!

11:11 -
We just had
7-8 orcas
heading east by
Tilly point on South Pender

Entry 13:
*

10:00 -
We live on he bluff at
Tulalip
and have been watching a single
small gray whale
feeding in the shallow water beyond
Jetty Island
on a daily basis all fall and winter. While I haven't been able to get a picture to identify it, I assume it is a stray juvenile. A few minutes ago we were watching a spout and a second larger spout appeared, then a third. I can't identify any of them yet, but the timing suggests the return of the sounders....They were near our house in shallow water showing their backs - no dorsal fins. Everything is weird as far as whales are concerned. I spent last week participating in whale week on the Oregon coast. I haven't seen the numbers, but the southern migration was the smallest at that point that I have seen in decades. I would see a half dozen a day. In other years we would see up to 40 or so. I did see a juvenile humpback from a boat (we were looking for grays) in close to shore north of Newport. The frequency of seeing humpbacks, both in the sound and offshore, is a relatively new phenomenon. The regular appearance of grays is also somewhat new, 25 years or so. I first encountered whales as a teenager in 1960; a pod of orca surrounded the rowboat I was in. I have been on the watch for them since then. -Curt Johnson

10:00 -
Morning! I've got
2 baleen whale blows
in my view. There's a bunch of activity associated with a bait ball bringing in a bunch of birds and a few pinnipeds. For the baleens I'm sure one is a gray based on the v shaped blow, but the other isn't at the right angle to tell much more then baleen whale. Both are visible at the same time through my binoculars but they're not together. 1/12/2019. -Amy Willoughby
