Orca Sightings for January 30, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -
L pod -
Canadian side of Haro Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait:...All the whales we could see were heading southerly toward
Beaumont Shoal and Seabird Point on Discovery Island
. The first whale we saw was
L115
before we moved to a distant small group that included
L72, L105, L90, and L103
. So, we had at least the group of
18 L pod whales that included the L4, L47, and L72 matrilines plus L90
. Since the other whales were so sparse and hard to find, plus the lack of any males larger than L105, it made us suspect that these 18 Ls were the only residents here...Full summary with photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 6.
L90 and L105
- Part of
L pod came down from the north through Haro Strait and headed west

Entry 2:

The
T85s
were travelling east several miles off the

waterfront, where part of

I was in the right place at the right time to see these beauties yesterday! This VIDEO (is beautiful, have a listen to their exhalations - alb) was taken at
11:52am Wednesday from

in University Place. I think there were
4 adults and 1 baby
. It was magical! -Paula White Young

10:32 - orcas well past Salmon Beach.
Around from Point Fosdick now, but still east side/midchannel. Headed towards Narrows bridge.

10:24 orcas
spotted at the north end of
Salmon Beach
, close to east side. I'm viewing from old Ferry Landing in Gig Harbor. Came to scout for the humpback and spotted 3-4 quick blows & dorsals instead. Not great visibility with the fog but can see across the sound well enough. They are heading south, at least 3. -Heidi Armstrong

Entry 4:
14:55 - Pier 70; Large whale
unsure of what type, blows RIGHT UNDER PIER. Headed north. Our guess was Humpback. -Theresa Rivkin
*
Here are some very poor photos (below and not so poor -alb) of yesterday's
humpback encounter in Seattle
just in case you want them as a record. Around

14:30
, happened to see him/her cruise by quite close to shore
along Alki Ave heading towards Elliott Bay
just below the surface. Was traveling quite fast all the way across Elliott Bay towards the ferry terminal, those in West Seattle lost sight. Noticed the Argosy boat headed straight towards it and they both appeared to go down one if the port channels. Never saw it after that. Waited about an hour & saw the boat head back to the dock but did not see the whale head back into the bay. Hope this is helpful for your records. Thanks for the work that you do to support our whale populations! -Sharon Wada

14:27 - whale sighted in Elliott Bay
right off of Pier 56 and Ferris wheel...Small dorsal. Kept heading north...My colleague took this from Pier 56. -Christian Runge

Entry 5:

off north side of
Alki heading into Elliott Bay

Entry 6:
*

11:43 -
Spotted single whale close to shore. South side of
Three Tree Point (near 2600 block SW 172nd, Burien
) heading north....Amazing!!! S/he was super close to shore though. Between buoys and shoreline, so have no doubt it was a whale....Didn't see dorsal fin clearly. Color grayish. Not an orca. Also moved like other
humpbacks
I've seen up north. -Sandhya Ballai
*

08:15 - Humpback
spotted off
Ruston Way in Tacoma
head towards Point Ruston. (Westbound). -Julie Martin

Entry 7:
17:35 -
Heading slowly back toward
Alki Point
after sunset.

17:00 -
Just spotted
2 dolphins heading south from Emma Schmitz Viewpoint
, looks like they are angling toward Lowman Beach. I wonder if the bottlenose that has been seen around lately has been joined by a friend? (Light conditions prevent positive species ID, though, so I'm not sure they were bottlenose.) -Stephanie Raymond

Entry 8:
porpoises
on Wednesday in
Saratoga Passage between Penn Cove and Madrona on Camano
, closer to the Camano side. Do you guys want to know when I see them? I see them a lot out here. -Wendy Nelson
