16:00 - I saw 4-5 orcas
at about 4 PM at the mouth of
commencement bay
. They were between point Ruston and the browns head lighthouse milling more towards the lighthouse. They appeared to be slowly moving north north west. My coworker in the area saw them earlier in the day (first spotted
2:30 or 3) along the northern edge of commencement bay. We both saw tail lobbing and some breaching. We don't know if they were residents or transients and they were too far to see saddle patches. -Cheers, Erin Stehr

15:50 - Orcas right off Browns Point lighthouse

Entry 2:
*

15:45 - Group of Orcas
killing a porpoise in front of
Browns point lighthouse
, I think it's a porpoise anyways. -Patricia Reynolds
*

13:30 - Orca in East Passage
approaching from the north about 500m off
Dash Point Pier
. The would come up as a group for a few seconds and the moving fast resurface further south. They had rounded Dash Point heading towards the Browns Point light by
1:45. I completely failed on pictures. Estimate about 6 animals. Looked like at least 2 calfs and 1 tall male dorsal. Moving fast. -Eric Elgar
