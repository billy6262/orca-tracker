Orca Sightings for November 18, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:30 pm...the hydrophones
have been noisy with many ships tonight...but in the middle of it all I heard a couple extremely faint sounds and then one very clear, what
sounded like a J Pod call
...thought I would post this rather vague bit, just in case the whales show up somewhere south or west tomorrow. It could be the J16s off from the rest of J Pod...maybe tomorrow we'll get to find out more. -Jeanne Hyde
