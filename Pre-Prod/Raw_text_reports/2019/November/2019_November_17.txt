Confirmed these were the
T18s - they continued up San Juan Channel and were left near Waldron
. The T18s seem to be our whales of autumn. They're the Ts we've seen on 3 of our last 4 encounters, all of them on Sundays! It was great today to get back out on OBI Juan and have them right in San Juan Channel. This photo is of
T19B Galiano
. The whales were all spread when he started a pinniped hunt, causing all four family members to converge. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
