Orca Sightings for November 29, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
HUMPBACK WHALES - Fri Nov 29 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - A group of hearty adventurers braved the brisk late November temperatures aboard J2 and headed west in search of cetaceans (Friday, Nov 29).
Constance Bank did not disappoint with humpbacks
as far as the eye could see. Only time will tell as to when warmer waters will beckon these gentle leviathans of the sea to leave their summer feeding grounds to breed and give birth.
MMY0080 Hemlock
was foraging in a zigzag pattern lunge feeding and showing us baleen at every twist and turn. Some whales used their giant pectoral fins to scoop up large amounts of forage fish feeding in close proximity to large numbers of seabirds and Steller's sea lions. It is heartwarming to see the 'humpback comeback' continue and most certainly these whales will depart the Salish Sea when the time is right with full bellies. -Debbie Stewart
