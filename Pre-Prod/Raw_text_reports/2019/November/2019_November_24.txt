Entry 1:
J pod - Puget Sound
- Sea lions can rest peacefully on the mid channel buoy off
Point No Point

Entry 2:
16:40 - Orcas
. Leaders past the
Edmonds Kingston ferry
. Hearing all their blows on this beautiful calm evening. Slow but steady SB travel.

16:25 - Orcas. Leaders approaching ferry. Seeing J 56 and mom
.

16:10 - Orcas, J pod. Sill north of Kingston between Apple Tree Point and Eglon.
One group foraging quite a bit. More further south of that group traveling SB. Kitsap side of shipping lanes.

15:40 - J pod.
Starting to see them from
Apple tree Point, Kingston
- coming from the north. Probably about straight out from Eglon. Southbound. -Sara Frey

I can see them through telescope from Mukilteo just
north of Eglon going southbound
. Pretty active. -Alice Thuy Talbot

14:50 - Orcas.
Line of sight about a mile south of
Point no Point
yellow channel marker.

14:45 - Orcas definitely heading southbound

14:35 -
Just received update from Brad Hanson, NOAA, NWFSC

14:30 -
They definitely have
flipped southbound
now - breach in front of research boat and they have turned on their jet packs - nice porpoise game steady soutbound approaching Scatchet Head from Point No Point.

14:27 - Orcas are stalled out from PNP
foraging and directional changes 1 Male trending sb slowly now back towards maxwelton/scatchet head Kitsap side of mid channel

13:58 - Orcas. Northbound steady
now approaching Cultus Bay Kitsap side

13:53 - J pod. 3-4 individuals foraging in front of Maxwelton
. I don't know if they might flip, they are stalled with research boat.

13:45 -
Research boat is trailing the male now heading slowly toward maxwelton.

13:40 -
Just saw a male dorsal
between Pt no Pt and Scatchet Head northbound
Kitsap side. Someone else reported a dorsal 40 feet off shore here (PNP) 25 minutes ago close to a sea lion so I'm not 100 percent sure they didn't see a sea lion flipper, but they were sure. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
See the male dorsal in the dark chop - this was looking
towards SW Whidbey from Point No Point
, somewhere in the 2 pm'ish range as they were getting ready to flip from northbound to southobound. This has been a pattern lately and its fun to watch (have seen it 3 times now). They travel north to Maxwelton and flip just about where Puget Sound becomes Admiralty Inlet! When they do, they mill around a bit and then suddenly turn on their jets and become more surface-active as they change directions and re-enter N Puget Sound.

J pod
did it again... Whidbey Islanders were caught off-guard with the first report from M/V Salish (Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry) of the
orcas traversing Admiralty Inlet southbound from around
8:15 am on the morning of

Entry 3:
15:55 - Orcas in Penn Cove
, Oak Harbor, Washington. They were definitely orcas. We saw
at least 3, maybe up to 5
. One of them had a very large dorsal fin. My daughter sails and she said it looked as big as a sail on the optis. There were a couple of smaller fins as well. We live off Scenic Heights and Park. and we initially saw them from our kitchen window. We watched them head out of Penn Cove from the beach. FACEBOOK VIDEO. -Noelle Bollek
(
Video shows 2 males, one with fat dorsal fin...one strong possibility is T18s who have been inland this month. - alb

11:30 - Four orcas (1 male?) spotted in Penn Cove
around
11:30 a.m. on Sunday, 11/24. Took this photo when we pulled over on Penn Cove Road to get a look. We watched them for about 20 minutes from Penn Cove Park as they headed east out of the cove. -Mary Gable

Entry 4:
minke
. New one for me. I saw what I'm guessing was a porpoise traveling south past
Possession Beach Park
about a hundred yards off shore, shallow surfacing every few hundred yards at about 9am Sunday morning,
November 24, 2019, alone. It was much smaller than any whales I've seen, definitely larger than a harbor seal, and didn't seem to be pausing to feed. It seemed healthy. It was traveling fast and surfacing shallowly enough that I wasn't able to take a photo of it. No distinctive markings. Small curved dorsal tail, all one color. -Tom Trimbath

Entry 5:
4-5 Dalls porpoise
pop up in front of ferry Sealth
San Juan channel
, porpoise traveling NW. Deck officer said they popped in front of the bow (sounds like they were bow riding - alb)
