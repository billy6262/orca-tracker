Orca Sightings for November 10, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's and L87 from Langley
. One of the pictures might be J56 with J31. I think it may be J42 rounding Sandy Point. This was Meliss's first experience to see these beauties from the shore. Hope you all are well, -David Haeckel
*

16:00 -
They are now
headed back south past Langley, at 4 pm
.

15:00 - For about an hour, starting about
3:00, we have been watching a pod of 5 or 6 orcas travel north mid Saratoga Passage to Langley
, then north a couple miles where they spent about half hour circling and tail slapping. -Peg Boley, Pebble Beach
*

16:25 - Around 12-15 whales (orcas) have passed Sandy Point heading south
in fairly leisurely fashion.

15:51 - Large group of orcas changed direction and now heading slowly south mid channel as seen from Langley
up above the Pizzeria. Two more whales logging as if waiting for bigger group to catch up. Beautiful sight.

14:25 - viewing whales heading toward Saratoga Passage from above Sandy Point
. -Sandra Pollard

November 10 day report: A whale of a day on Whidbey Island starting off mid-morning at Glendale beach. It wasn't long before we spotted telltale dorsal fins and blows
heading our way from Possession Sound
threatening to hold up the Clinton/Mukilteo ferries - which they did with a splash! Despite their having picked up the pace, we arrived in good time at
Brighton Beach
to welcome the whales again as they
traversed the waters between Whidbey and Hat Island on their continued northbound journey
toward Saratoga Passage. The whales
passed Sandy Point
exhibiting some foraging behavior, breaches and spy-hops, before grouping up off Langley and (to our surprise) then slowing down and turning back south. Our last sighting of them was as they laconically passed Sandy Point, a little more split up than we had seen them from Langley, but not too far apart from each other either. Their imposing presence, especially when they were so closely grouped as a closely bonded family unit, acted as a sharp reminder of how important it is to enable this fragile and unique population to survive.

Entry 7:
~

10:15 - Minke whale foraging right off Eglon
as I look for SRKWs approx
10:15 it surfaced and then showed a nice fluke Caveat: I realize that minke's rarely show their flukes but this whale clearly had a curved dolphin-shaped dorsal, and a very wide fluke that was crystal clear as it went down. I would think it was a humpback based on the way it fluked but the shape was flatter and wider. Was very close to a fishing boat. It surfaced a few times, then the fluke, then done, presuming it went south towards Rose Point. -Donna Green van Renselaar
