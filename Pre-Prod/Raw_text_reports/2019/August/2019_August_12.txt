Entry 3:
12:20 -
This is my first sighting so forgive my lack of information. From the pier at
holiday beach in Hoodsport
. A small pod of
what I thought, at first were pilot whales, was traveling west out Hood canal
. They appeared to stop and play near Sund Rock Conservation...They all appeared grayish, but darker rather than light(I noticed no additional colors) . The point or tip of their dorsal fin was angled back towards their tail it's curvature similar to a pseudo orca. There were 4-6 of those cute buggers I think, all swimming nonchalantly, but paused near Sund Rock for a while and I wondered if it was too eat as it was that time I saw them surface gently more quickly in succession. Their lengths clearly varied, but I'd estimate them between 7 and 4feet....The picture of the harbor porpoise looks the closest. Hope this helps and thank you. Area. It was incredible. -Jacob Cartwright
