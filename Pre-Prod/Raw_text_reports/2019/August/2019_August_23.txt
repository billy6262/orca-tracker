19:00 - Bigg's transient orcas T37, T34s, and T37Bs came into Active Pass

8/23: great day with
humpbacks (Scratch MMY0079 and another
who wouldn't fluke up) near
MacArthur Bank
and then
T46B and her girls and little calf....T46B1s were about 5 miles north closer to Cattle Pass. All of the T46B matriline except T46B1 and her calves, T46B1A and T46B1B (Tl'uk gray calf).
They were sort of leisurely hunting but definitely made a kill as the smell was pretty strong! Some breaching and tail slapping, too. Beautiful glassy water! Also saw a sea otter near Whale Rocks, first time I've seen one here, and a puffin near Smith Island. -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 5:
T137s
- Friday morning, we received reports of the
T137s
heading east near
William Head
(west of Victoria). There was concern over the welfare of T137A who was reported to be acting lethargic and was often trailing the rest of the group....While something was definitely wrong with T137A's behavior, how he looked physically was a lot harder to judge. T137A, at least in his teenage years, has historically had a different appearance than most transients.... See full report and photos of T137A over the years at Center for Whale Research Encounter 55.
*
We have a report of
T137A 1.5 nm south of Albert Head
(west of Victoria) currently traveling in a lazy line towards Victoria. The ALERT, however, is both yesterday and today he has been acting "odd" and very lethargic, with his family seeming to check in on him from time to time, but he's often traveling alone and slow behind the rest of the group. Please keep a keen eye out for him, report him on the PWWA Sightings page and the App if you can, but while we'd like to keep track of him let's give him some extra space in case he's not feeling well. The Center for Whale Research has been alerted, and may make an effort today to check on his condition. -Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, PWWA

Entry 7:
Scratchy MMY0079
and another who wouldn't fluke up) near
MacArthur Bank and then T46B and her girls and little calf....T46B1s
were about 5 miles north closer to Cattle Pass. Scratchy has these two nice white marks on the dorsal fin, so can be i.d.'d even without a fluke up tail dive...They were sort of leisurely hunting but definitely made a kill as the smell was pretty strong! Some breaching and tail slapping, too. Beautiful glassy water! Also saw a sea otter near Whale Rocks, first time I've seen one here, and a puffin near Smith Island. -Bonnie Gretz
