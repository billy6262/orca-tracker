Orca Sightings for August 21, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
next morning (22nd) near Sheringham Point heading west again
. Whale reports had been filing in for most of an extremely gray and rainy Wednesday. Most of
J pod was heading south from Pt. Roberts and the J16s, Ks, and Ls had been coming in from Sooke
since the early morning. There were also several groups of transients scattered about the central Salish Sea... Full report with images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 54

It was a full house at
Lime Kiln Point State Park
tonight. Watching
J-pod
pass by after sunset to the excited wonder of those seeing them for the first time made it well worth the wait. It was pretty dark, but I thought you might enjoy these pictures. One with
J56
(the new little calf) and the other with
J27 "Blackberry.
" You will need to click on the pictures to see all the whales. -Alison Engle

It was quite the whale day on
San Juan Island
! In the
morning and afternoon, four different groups of Bigg's killer whales
were visible from the shores of San Juan. Then in the evening, the
18 whales from J-Pod
that have been in the Salish Sea for a week made their way down
Haro Strait
, while the
J16s, K-Pod, and a portion of L-Pod came in from the Strait of Juan de Fuca
! This is the first time Ls have come into inland waters since February! J-Pod took their time getting to Lime Kiln as they came down Haro, but once they did, it's almost as if Ks and Ls came into acoustic range, because they started porpoising south. The whales not only looked excited but sounded excited as well - the link below is to a short clip of their vocalizations as they started porpoising! Many of you have been asking about
L87 Onyx, who had not been seen with J-Pod in the Salish Sea over the last week
. He did indeed return with L-Pod today. Is this the beginning of a new chapter in the Onyx story? While in our minds it's not a true "superpod" unless the entire Southern Resident community is present, we are beyond excited to have members of all three pods present, and have our fingers and toes crossed that there's enough salmon to entice them to stay around for a while! -Monika Wieland Shields

20:41 -
Still hearing one loud repetitive
call on OrcaSound
, which doesn't match with the posts that
Js were at LK heading south toward Ks & Ls?
Unless they are so spread out there are stragglers far enough north to be heard on the OS Hp?

20:27 -
Hearing
calls on OrcaSound
now. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
(
Bizarre! I only counted 14 passing LK where there should have been 18. I just figured I missed some, but maybe some are trailing - Monika Wieland Shields
)
*

20:34 - Bumper to bumper orcas. Haro Strait between Edwards Point and Hannah Hts
. At
8:34pm, after sunset but I was able to count
8-9 individuals, traveling quickly to the S/SE
. A leading group of 2 were about nine-orca-lengths ahead of a big male who was 4-orca-lengths in front of a tight group of 5-6. It was getting dark but I think I saw a calf. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
*

19:51 - County Park, J pod
between rock and bouy...Active breaches, just chillin' on a beautiful evening! -John Attila Umar
*

19:37 - Js.
Blows in sight way
north of Lime Kiln
, and breach splashes. -Monika Wieland Shields

18:36 - Whales off shore Eagle
, southbound again! Very spread out, groupings of twos, fours, sixes. Water and wind kicking up. -Lodie Gilbert Budwill
*

18:00 -
What a day! Sounds like
Ks and Ls off the south end of San Juan and Js coming down Haro from the north. Ts scattered all over.
1800 It sounds like
L87 came back in with Ls
. -Monika Wieland Shields

17:32 -
Can see at least
6-8 resident orcas foraging between Pilot Point and Hannah Heights

*
With an early report from fishing friends of
a few Orca off Otter point
this morning around
8 am heading east
I went out by myself at 9 am to see what Transients might be around. To my surprise it was L Pod and a few turned into many! With all due respect I kept my distance with motors shut down and tried to get a few pictures as they passed by and than after about 15 minutes...headed back to our docks. Our team does not promote or take guests to our Southern Residents when other whales are present, but was a special treat for me. There he is....
L87 Onyx coming in with who turned out to b J16s, K pod, & part of L pod
. Thank you nature! -Paul Pudwell

10:16 - L pod and maybe K pod inbound from Sooke

Entry 3:
14:30 - Six orcas
, including one adult male, swimming in a tight group west-to-east
off of S. Lopez, near Flint Beach
. -Tom Reeve
*
...As we headed into the Castle rock area we found a couple of adult bald eagles and got a nice surprise greeting from the
T10's
!!! These Biggs orca whales had apparently just served dinner and T10C "Bones" brought some left overs by the boat to show it off. It was definitely a harbor seal, or the remains of what was a harbor seal that we easily identified since it was hanging out of T10C's mouth. T10C was also leaving a trail of scraps behind him which a few bald eagles were able to capitalize on by swooping in and grabbing chunks out of the water. After the orcas finished this meal off they continued west bound along the southern coast of Lopez island. We followed along from a distance as the low-lying clouds soon turned into marine layer fog. As the Biggs orcas faded in and out of sight we had reports of a second pod in the area. Suddenly the fog began to clear and out of nowhere the T109's showed up and joined the T10's...
