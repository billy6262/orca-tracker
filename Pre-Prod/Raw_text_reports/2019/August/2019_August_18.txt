Orca Sightings for August 18, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Meeting newest
Southern Resident calf J56
for the first time early one summer
morning
off the
San Juan Island west side

Entry 2:
Haro Strait
- Finally got to see some of
J pod
! A lovely time with the the
J16's just north of South Beach
, San Juan Island, as they headed north. A few distant breaches, a sweet spyhop from J16 Slick....so wonderful to see them, and so nice to know the rest of J pod was nearby. -Bonnie Gretz

09:15 - Js, just past County Park still slow north.
There's nothing like a resting line first thing in the morning (or anytime, really! This was most of
J-Pod as seen off San Juan County Park this morning

Entry 3:

08:00 - Jpod is north of lime kiln
together in a resting line headed north. Fog rolling in. -Traci Walter

07:46 - This morning at Lime Kiln
on a Sunday! If you know me, you know what a miraculous feat that is! Not much gets this body out of bed that early, except for whales. It felt like a blast from the past. Racing (not excessive) to Lime Kiln, and sprinting down the hill to the lighthouse. Watching most of Jpod (minus the J16's) in a resting line was pretty amazing. I so miss these opportunities to see them from Lime Kiln. To top if off, I got to watch with some dear fellow whale nerds. It was so wonderful to "meet" J56 too!!! -Traci Walter

Entry 4:
Strait of Georgia - This pod of 3 big ones (and a baby, I think)
swam leisurely along the rocks and did not bother to go after the many terrified seals.. They came near shore and near the reef. A beautiful sight in the evening light with Baker in the background. -Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island
(
Melisa Pinnow, CWR reviewed many images and ID'd them as
T49As

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Sun Aug 18 - Pender Harbor, Sunshine Coast BC - Sorry for late sighting report. As sun setting
3-4 orcas
were feeding
inside Pender Harbour on Sunshine Coast
area in BC. They stayed for about 40 minutes or so but as there is no speed or noise enforcement inside harbour, much to dismay of many residents, 2 open stack speed boats raced in about 80 kph which happens frequently sadly, (they did not even see whales) and another guy came speeding out towards them in his inflatable. I was distraught but too dark to get info on any of the boats. The orcas looked like two adults and a young one. Could have been 4 total. Not sure. I was in row boat. I called DFO to report conflict with them but of course they cannot be everywhere. -Gaylene Lueger
