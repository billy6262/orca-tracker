Orca Sightings for August 22, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thu Aug 22 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - We headed out west this morning from a report from one of our guests that was camping at French Creek that they thought they seen Orcas from shore...sure enough we did find what looked to be
J,K, and L pod heading west past Sherrigham Lighthouse - L72 Racer, J38 Cookie all grown up
wide spread across the Juan De Fuca Strait...respectively we visited them for about 10 minutes...took a few pictures and left them to themselves... Then we looked for other whales and hooray we found
Transients not too far away
...I believe some of the T046 matriline were present....Than on the way to Race Rocks Lighthouse we stopped and visited
a few different humpback whales
. Wow what a day off Sooke with just our boats! -Paul Pudwell

Entry 2:
Transient/Biggs whales traveling along the shore of Sidney Island
, slowly northbound. It's always surprising to see
T037Bs
"resident-like" saddle patch! Always fun to see these whales. Homeward bound we found Scratchy the Humpback several miles west of Smith Island. Thank you Puget Sound Express. -Jill Hein

08:33 - Killer whales milling just south of Westside Preserve
...ecotype unknown (no large males present)...3-5. They seem to have given us the slip...Brittany Noelle Philbin

Entry 3:
Humpback (MMY0079)
several miles
west of Smith Island

Entry 4:
NAS Whidbey
just south of the runway birdwatching with a spotting scope about 9 am today and saw a
gray whale surface and spout
. It was out far enough that it would have been hard to see without binoculars or scope. Thanks! -Mary Jo Adams

Entry 5:
10:30 - Gray whale (70% confident) Wollochet Bay
. Gray feeding in shallow inner bay at
10:30 am Aug 22, 2019...Missed the photo, waited over 5 minutes no resurface. It was about 80-100 yards away, bubble ring looked to appear first and whale surfaced with gapping mouth and then submerged. -Dave McEntee
