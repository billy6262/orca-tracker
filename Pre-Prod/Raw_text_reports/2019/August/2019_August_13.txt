Orca Sightings for August 13, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
west of Sooke! Transient killer whales T101s

Entry 2:
Admiralty Inlet - ~

17:20 -

20:30
- We watched them (
T46 group
) from about
7:20 pm until
8:30 ish - the Transients continued south in Admiralty, we watched as
they traveled from the south end of Marrowstone Island (~
7:20), to just north of Skunk Bay (~
8:30)
. They were spread out across the Inlet, some close to the Whidbey side, others mid-channel. Then we saw the
two humpbacks
continuing south - first in front of the orcas, then later swimming parallel to them, moving much further from the Whidbey side. We for sure saw one of the humpbacks continuing south as we left around
8:30. The orcas stopped and seemed to have made a kill mid-channel, then were below for awhile, and then continuing south past
Foulweather Bluff toward Skunk Bay/Hansville
. Tried to find them through the big eyes when we got back from the bluff, but it was too dark to find them. What an awesome evening of orcas, humpbacks, fuschia sunset, Mt Ranier bathed in pink, and a rising golden moon ~ we are so fortunate to live in the Salish Sea! -Report from Susan Berta & Wendy Sines, Orca Network

Entry 6:
06:31 - 4-5 orcas heading towards Joemma State Park from Devils Head in Case Inlet

Note: we had no other orca sightings reported, we do think it possible they were the common dolphins - alb
