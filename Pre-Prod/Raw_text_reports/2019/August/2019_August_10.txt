Orca Sightings for August 10, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
20:20 - T065A2 swam slowly westward through Active Pass off the shores of Galiano Island.
. An hour later, perhaps after a circumnavigation of Prevost Island, he swam stealthily eastward through the Pass. On his return, all was calm and we could clearly hear him breathing as he hung on the surface for two or three breaths. Photos taken from the shore of Galiano Island. -Karoline Cullen

Sat Aug 10 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Our afternoon tour had the pleasure today to change it up and visit the
T046's and T046B's Transient Killer Whales and my favorite Transient Killer Whale T011A off Sooke and many a humpback whales too
. -Paul Pudwell

Sat Aug 10 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Port Angeles Trip: Our westbound track out of Port Angeles harbor took us out by
Crescent Bay on the peninsula
. From the water, we could see forested mountain tops through the clouds and drizzle. The further west we went, the less rain we encountered which was great because this is where we encountered our first
humpback whale of the day, known as "MMZ0030"
(no nickname yet) and another a bit further off. We watched this whale while it headed eastbound through the strait. Moments later, Captain Scott located another humpback which turned out to be
"Lyra"
. It turns out, we hit the jackpot of humpbacks!! There were several more in the vicinity, including,
"Hemlock"
and three others just
off Beechy Head in Canada
, two of which were spending quite a bit of time together. They barely raised their flukes high enough upon diving so will have to spend a bit more time on those to confirm IDs....Renee Beitzel, Island Adventures

Sat Aug 10 - Strait of Juan de Fuca...Then we had the pleasure to share the beauty of our west coast and
20+ humpback whales
. Only a few were fluking for some reason. Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell

COMMON DOLPHINS - Sat Aug 10 - Just saw your comment on the post about orcas headed for Joemma State Park and that they may have been common dolphins. We had a great encounter with
a pod of what we're pretty sure were common dolphins last Saturday in Case Inlet
...We saw them on Saturday the 10th, at about
4pm
in Case Inlet a little southwest of Joemma State Park. There were at least 3 of them, possibly up to 5. We were traveling northward on our sailboat heading toward McMicken Island from Olympia when we saw the splashing over near the Key Peninsula. We slowed down and maneuvered in large circles watching them jump from the water repeatedly and, twice, they came over to our boat to check us out and then immediately swam away again. It seemed like feeding behavior but we're unsure. -Rachel Messerschmidt

Entry 2:
14:41 - Looks like they're heading farther south
.

14:30 - Whale out at Deception Pass
west beach a little south towards Oak Harbor. There's one whale boat out there
can't tell if it's a grey or humpback
. -Liz Davdison
