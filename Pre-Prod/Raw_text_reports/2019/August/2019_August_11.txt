============================================================

Entry 1:
L77 & her new calf L124 - J31 & her new calf J56 - Swiftsure Bank

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca
- Great day out west again...really happy to share my favorite
Transient Killer Whale T011a
again today with some great guests...he seems to be a "Local" the last few days! Then with calm seas and our west coast built vessels we can get to the
humpback whales further out
west than most. -Paul Pudwell

Entry 4:
Strait of Juan de Fuca
- Great day out west again...Then with calm seas and our west coast built vessels we can get to the humpback whales further out west than most, with time to spare! Yes we had around
40+
and was a sight to sea! -Paul Pudwell (
