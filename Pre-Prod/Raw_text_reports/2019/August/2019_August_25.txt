Orca Sightings for August 25, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait...J53
was seen playing with a piece of kelp all by herself-tossing it in the air and vocalizing above the surface.
J pod headed slowly around Kellett Bluff
and the encounter ended at 1130. The
J16s and L87 did not seem to be present
during this encounter. -Report and images (w/baby photos) at Center for Whale Research Encounter 56.
*
Amazingly, after a 5+ week absence, we've now had
Southern Residents in the Salish Sea on 11 out of the last 12 days
. We hope you don't get tired of pictures of little
J56
, because we are completely smitten with her. We don't seem to be the only ones, either - she has really been making the rounds in J-Pod, regularly traveling/playing with members from all matrilines. Here she is traveling
alongside J40 Suttles heading south past Lime Kiln
this afternoon. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behaviro Institute
*

18:18 - 3 orcas north of Eagle Point
- (includes one little dude or dudette ) - headed south - more coming from
False Bay
area - about 20 altogether. -Chris Wilson
*

16:30 -

16:50 - Haro Strait, SJI
. Observed from shore.

4:30pm -
4:50pm, Minke and orca (possibly residents and transients?)
An unusual sighting, between
Edwards Point and Hannah Hts
traveling generally to the south, I watched
4-5 minke traveling with 10-12 orca
. I was looking directly into the sun with the saddle patches in shadow but I believe I saw
J27 Blackberry
(??). His group was closer to shore. Debra Giles and Eba were following collecting scat. I think I saw
T75
in a group farther out. The minke's were in the middle and they were moving away from the island. The minkes surfaced many times, 2 groups of 2 and a single. 2 beautiful breaches. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
*

16:04 -
Hearing orca calls on Orcasound (
4:04pm)
! Haro Strait. Sound like Southern Residents....but I'm just guessing. -T.L. Stokes

11:16 - Calls on OrcaSound
NOW! Nice and loud and happy! I'm not confident. But I thought Js. Squeals. Honks. Whistles. -Kim Merriman
*

11:00 -
We spotted several
orca, suspected J-pod
, according to a seasoned watcher next to us. Off S
an Juan County Park, headed north
, 11AM. I believe we saw J-56! My first ever sighting. Best birthday gift I could ask for! -Rebecca Fredstedt

09:30 - J Pod Lime Kiln northbound

19:00 -
An hour before sunset, Aug. 25, 2019, three of us observed
4-6 orcas cruising north
along the kelp line at the southeast edge of
Useless Bay
. Not close enough to identify markings but some tall fins. They cruised along the surface for 3-4 minutes then dove deep and were lost. -Thomas James
*

18:56 -
I didn't see the northbound group come back, but did see others with the male heading south just before I left. -Dori Dace
*

18:44 -
Sarah MacDougall reports seeing
4-5 orcas off Adams Rd
. in Freeland. They left heading south. --

18:22 - 4 orcas heading south viewing from Scatchet Head
looking southwest...I think it's the same group. The three seem to be waiting for the male. He is following a little behind. They look to be rounding Whidbey to head up Possession Sound. It's actually fascinating to watch.
The group of three will turn back from time to time almost like they are checking on him.
-Danielle Pennington
*

18:02 - Three orca
continued north (mid channel,
west side of Whidbey.
), the male is still in the same location.

17:40 -
Orcas aren't close, but just met up with a male - still milling in same area, directly
west from Scatchet Head
.

17:37 - Orca
. I am on the point of
Scatchet Head
looking directly across at the green buoy. At least three whales just north of the buoy - currently milling.

17:28 - Orca.
Still northbound north of the green buoy - sea lion desperately trying to get up on the buoy - lots of surface activity mid channel.

17:20 - Orca
, northbound directly
across from Scatchet Head
just behind the cruise ship. -Dori Dace
*

16:50 -
I moved back to higher vantage. Saw
Pod south of Scatchet
was very surface active, maybe hunting or ? Don't know story, but whales very close to now idle small private boat. Maybe was idle fishing or came upon them by surprise, but just a reminder to give these whales at least 200 yards. Its 5 now and am not seeing activity now.

16:35 -
I am seeing many dorsal and blows probably ~
2 miles south of Scatchet Head

12:25 -
Watching from ON HQ
1 mile so. of Bush Point

12:25 orcas were
south of Foulweather Bluff continuing south

Entry 8:
spouts in Hood Canal between Lofall and the Hood Canal Bridge around
6:00pm
tonight. No breaching but multiple spouts. Our (four adults) guess that it was
a single whale
but we couldn't tell. We only saw about five or six blows and they were all one at a time. We had no other observations, but I had hoped this would help if others had sightings. -Alan Robertson
