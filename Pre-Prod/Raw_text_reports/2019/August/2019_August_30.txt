Orca Sightings for August 30, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait
- It had been awhile since Ken had an encounter with the resident whales, so when everybody else was ending their whale watch day he cast off from Snug Harbor in "Chimo" at 1606 in the late afternoon in hopes of getting a glimpse of how the new baby,
J56
, was doing.
About two miles off False Bay
, San Juan Island,
J27
was spotted foraging in the tidal chop near the end of an incoming tide. Soon,
J35
appeared nearby also foraging while accompanied by two young females
J53 and J56
that appeared to be having a marvelous time splashing alongside... Notes-Comments: Another photograph was taken of
J56
rolling around with J53 and J35, confirming
she is female
...Full report with photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 58.
