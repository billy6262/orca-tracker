Orca Sightings for February 21, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
A
humpback whale
who has been spending time traveling up and down Puget Sound the past few weeks is seen here paralleling the shore while heading northbound towards the jetty at the
north end Marina Beach Park, Edmonds

Entry 2:
The dorsal of this whale matches the
humpback whale
who has been traveling Puget Sound since at least late January who does not raise it's fluke when sounding. We'll refer to her/him as
PS Mn Unknown 2019 #1
until we have match or other ID# designation - alb
)

18:30 -
Michelle Goll and I decided to carpool north and waited at Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach in hopes the
humpback
would arrive before dark. The sunset was remarkable, the sky and water painted in pinks, oranges, golds...shimmering and glittery. Around

18:00
, with much narrower swath of colored light beaming across the Sound, I spotted an
exhalation and the head of the humpback
to the south, traveling towards us hugging the shoreline. I observed two more surfaces. We waited anticipating the humpback would be visible as s/he continued and hoped for a surface in what remained of the light on the water, but s/he may have gone on a long dive because it was in near total darkness when we heard the whale blow directly out from our position at the southern end of the beach and we could just make out aher/his shape while gliding through the water. We walked along with the whale as she surfaced 2 more that we could hear but not see, and then one more last surface approx
6:30, again audible and this time visible...we both caught a visual of the black shape of her/his low arch as s/he slipped under water on her/his way north. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

17:20 -
David Freed reported seeing
a whale between Mukilteo and Edmonds
from the train at approx
5:20.
(
Upon further discussion David said he did not have a noticeable dorsal, but looked like he saw a row of nubbies along it's back. We presume he saw the humpback who would have been right in this very area at this time, but leaving open possibility there was another whale -alb
)

16:00 -

16:35 -
I relocated to
Edmonds Marina Beach
could see whale blows just to the south approaching the dog park area, but a bit farther offshore than s/he had been when passing Shoreline & Woodway. The
humpback
continued
steady northbound
passing in front of us and manybeach goers, same pattern leading with rostrum, pushing water, shallow surfaces and low arch when sounding on longer dive. S/he rounded the jetty at north end of the park about
16:10. I then relocated to just south of the ferry dock and watched the humpback keep steady northbound clearing the
Edmonds Ferry dock
(just ahead of the incoming ferry) around
16:20 still northbound at steady pace. I then relocated further north off Ocean Ave, pulled up and saw the whale slightly south of me, just north of and outside the
Edmonds Dive Park
keeping steady pace. Stayed long enough to watch a few surface intervals in glassy calm seas and left her/him heading towards Possession Sound to the north of us approximately

16:30-
16:35. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

15:15 -

15:45 -
After waiting for about an hour down on shore at
Richmond Beach Saltwater park
, I finally caught a glimpse of the
humpback
to the south of the point between
Carkeek
and my location, this was approximately
15:15. The humpback continued in a line which looked as though s/he may be heading more offshore. A few minutes later (same as in Komo 4 video) a group of sea lions started porpoising along near the whale! What I know of this whale is s/he likes to hug the shore so I was hopeful s/he would round the point following the shoreline. Several minutes passed when about
15:25 I saw a large disturbance in the south end of the slight bay, the humpback was ~100 feet offshore. S/he continued surfacing in regular intervals, pushing the water with her/his rostrum while barely surfacing, but at times showing a little dorsal. On 4-5th surface a more pronounced arch (though not as pronounced as what I've typically observed in most humpbacks when sounding). Dozens of happy humans lined the beach on this gorgeous sunny day watching this humpback pass by very close to shore. I ran to keep up with the whale who was passing the north end of the park by
15:30 holding steady swift pace towards Woodway inshore. Sweet whale! (Very brief FB Video) I then moved to
Kayu Kayu Ac
park, further north in Shoreline and immediately spotted the humpback just offshore. I watched her/him surface several times and disappear around the dock at Point Wells, Woodway now on her/his way to Edmonds, time approx
15:45. The humpback did not raise her/his fluke during either of these passes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

13:51 -
Saw from land; just south of
Discovery Park
. Always a special event. Did not have my binoculars though!! -Deborah B. Cushing
*

13:45 - Humpback.
..from
Discovery Point Lighthouse
...maybe 30-40ft (from shore). Lost sight of it after it went around the point, then saw intermittent blows off
Golden Gardens
(judging that far away though was hard). Probably stayed more middle channel or east of mid channel NB. -Brittany Noelle Philbin

Entry 5:
~

12:55 - Gray sighted off Mukilteo ferry dock
about
12:55 heading north...It was a ways off Mukilteo just when the boat left and was headed toward Everett. Since there was quite a bit of distance, it is possible it was not a gray, but certainly was not an orca. Pretty cool about the humpback; we've seen a number of them near Johnstone Straits and Queen Charlotte Sound. -Sue Ellen White

Entry 6:

09:43 -
I just saw it (
gray whale
) 4 more times. On the east side of spot itself heading south and then north of it mid channel.

08:45 - Gray whale
at tip of
Cooper Point on Budd Inlet
side. Traveling back and forth. Two surfaces and then a long dive. Watched 8 of these series. Was very close to shore and one time it looked like it was trying to feed. I have now lost it in the hot morning sun on the water. -Kim Merriman
