Orca Sightings for February 9, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
"apparent orca sighting"
because some of the dark shapes in the attached photos sure like orcas to me--despite the poor visibility. I was actually taking pictures of the snowy scenes on Vashon Island, directly across from my
West Seattle
home (approximately one-half mile south of Brace Point). I did not notice the "orcas" until I downloaded the frames to my computer and examined them more closely. The dark black "cone" in the lower center struck me immediately. If I am not mistaken that is an orca "sky-hopping". When I looked closer at other parts of the photo, I noticed another "orca" doing a back flop--right pectoral flipper spread wide. The other "orcas" are not so apparent, but would explain the abnormal coloration and disturbance of the water (all circled in red in the second photo). -Regards, Jim Nunn

Entry 2:
Lantzville, BC [about 10 miles NW of Nanaimo in Georgia Strait]
and saw
3 or 4 orca
right across from me, on Maude Island (Winchelsea Islands) from approximately
1630 to about 1800
(it got dark so couldn't see them anymore). I did not see saddle patches unfortunately. If the neighbour did get photos, I will ask her to forward to them me or to Orca Network. -Juli Wild
