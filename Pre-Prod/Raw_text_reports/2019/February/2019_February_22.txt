Hi. Just wanted to let you know, Believe I saw a
humpback
this morning (Friday 2/22) at
10:30 am from the Ferry Boat docked on the
northend of Vashon Island.
Whale came right up to the stern of the ferry while docked and we got a good view of its side. Unfortunately it moved away quickly and was out of range before I could get my phone to take any pictures. Watched it head south a little ways toward Dolphin Point before the boat left....I have seen greys and humpbacks, in canada, California and baja - so I felt like I just knew.. but thanks for asking for clarification... I saw a dorsal when it was diving (saw it dive twice)...Kevin Kim-Murphy
