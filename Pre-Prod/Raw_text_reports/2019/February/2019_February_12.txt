Entry 2:
09:06 -
I can only see through my spotting scope they are about a mile out. And a mile west of Harborview now, headed towards Mukilteo.

08:51 - Pair of grey whalesbetween Harborview park and Hat Island
sighted, heading southwest. -Ryley Fee

Entry 3:
10:50 -
Observing activity in
Possession Sound
about 3 miles northeast of Mukilteo Lighthouse - moving in a westerly direction... Color and dorsal fin suggest Orca X 2, but distance from our location makes it difficult to confirm. This is VERY exciting! -Le Schneider

10:15 -
My son saw blows from
Mukilteo
about an hour ago (
10:15)...I asked he had no direction. His co worker said he saw a black tail (he thought) they are at a house/job site with a great view! -Joni Pollino
(
Gray whales were reported in the area around this same time, but leaving open possibility of orcas since they've been inland Puget Sound as well - alb
)
