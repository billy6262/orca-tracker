15:04 - Humpback.
Moving fast! Now crossing the mouth of

now, still northbound. -Stephanie Raymond

Entry 4:
16:10 -
I am on
Mukilteo ferry
, can see blows of
single large whale
few miles south of the ferry lane. Direction of travel looked to be east/northeast. Just got into town from Omaha so how cool to be greeted by a whale! -Rachel Haight
*

Entry 5:
14:42 - Dolphins
(originally reported as orcas) south of
Alki Point
: Here is the original image posted from the DSLR viewer. This looks much more like a dolphin and was taken approx 10 minutes after (~
14:40 ) the one I posted above that is a bit more blurry and was about 200 yards south (~
14:30). Milling around and was with one other but I didn't get a shot of them both at once. The other shot that was from 10 minutes prior looked to be a different one that was by itself. Once the humpback passed through this area I didn't see them again. -Kevin Murry
*

13:55 - dolphins/porpoises
moving south. Seen south
Brace Point (West Seattle)
...I did not get photos! They were moving fast and I had only my phone. Seemed that a a lot of the body came out, so likely dolphins. -Darcey Miller
*

Entry 6:
West Seattle dolphin
sighting by Kevin Murry included in our last Whale Report: "Yes, those are almost certainly
bottlenose dolphins
....I suspect that it is two different dolphins, though it isn't clear enough to say for certain." -Dave
