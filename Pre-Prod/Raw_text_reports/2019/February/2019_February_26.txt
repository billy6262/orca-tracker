============================================================

Entry 1:
09:09 - Orca off whiffin spit east Sooke
side heading for possesion point east right now!...could only see a few from the house...to rough out to investigate further... Likely T's almost came into harbour but were tight to shore line heading out and than east. -Paul Pudwell

Entry 2:
4 different gray whales in Snohomish River delta
. My daughter took some pictures with her telescopic lens (see Spring Freeman photos below). When we first noticed them, they were spread out over the entire delta. They traveled south and west to deeper water. Again thanks for the info....
Original email: My wife and I have been watching a whale or two all winter long south of Tulalip Reservation between Everett and Hat island. We're pretty sure they are not Orcas. Grays fed here in the spring. Just wondering if you could shed some light on the species and why they're here. Thanks for any info. -Jim Quintel
