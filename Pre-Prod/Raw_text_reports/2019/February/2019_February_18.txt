Orca Sightings for February 18, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
1323
, a whale watching boat reported that they had found members of J
pod near East Point, Saturna Island
. Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1415 aboard "Orcinus". At 1454, "Orcinus" arrived on scene with the
J16s about three-quarters of a mile west of the Patos Island lighthouse. J16, J36, and J42
were traveling east tight together.
J26
was paralleling them a few hundred yards to the north and swam over to join them soon after...At
1618
, the J16s joined the
J11s, J14s, J19s, and J22s
and they all turned south toward
President Channel
, though they seemed a bit indecisive about it at first. The encounter was ended at 1631 as the whales slowly swam south along the
Sucia Island
shoreline toward Present Channel. The
J17s and L87 were not present
during the encounter so the CWR will wait for another J pod encounter to confirm how J17 is faring. - Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 11.

11:17 - A whale
swam 100 feet from shore yesterday in
Poverty Bay, just west of Redondo Beach
...traveled westbound along the shore of the 200 block of SW 292nd St. Whale was halfway between the water's edge and the mooring buoys. A place that's dry tidelands at low tide!...of the most common whales in Salish Sea, it must closely resembled a humpback.

Entry 4:

Entry 5:
Possession Sound -

Spotted from ferry to Mulkiteo from Clinton at 345pm today just north of Clinton ferry dock. Not sure what kind of whale, some saw large dorsal fin (like us) others also saw big tail dive down....Yes it was amazing to see as I held my two year old son. His first whale! My husband and I saw it from different spots on the ferry - he saw a tail from inside the ferry and thinks it was a gray or humpback. I however rushed outside with a group and saw a dorsal fin from the back of the ferry gliding through the water and disappearing - which I assumed was an orca but I didn't have my glasses on so it could have been a tail... - was hoping you might have other accounts to verify ... sorry we couldn't be of more help. It was very far away and very quick. -Sophie R Serrano

Have been following one down
Rustin Way
today, last seen by the theatre at Point Rustin...unfortunately we didn't get a good view of the dorsal so we're unsure (if gray or humpback). -Gail Kobylinski
