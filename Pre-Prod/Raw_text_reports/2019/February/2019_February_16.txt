BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Sat Feb 16 - It's always a pleasure to meet new (to me) whales! Here are three of the first Bigg's killer whales of 2019 for me---left to right,
T69D1 (b. 2013), T69D2 (b. 2016), and mom, T69D (b. 2001)

Only the

.)

...At
0942
I spotted a group of
killer whales near Little Zero Rock
through the binoculars. We approached the area slowly waiting for another sighting but it wasn't until well over 10 minutes before I spotted them again (48 30.9/123 17.5) They were doing between 10 and 14 minute dives the whole time we were there.
T090 and T090D
were slightly east of the
rest of the T090's and the T069D's
. Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 10.
