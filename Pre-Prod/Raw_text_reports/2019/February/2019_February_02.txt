The report below by Andrew we are leaving as is with reporting parties ID of who he thinks he saw. We had no other reports of J pod anywhere inland Salish Sea so ID is UNCONFIRMED as there are no photos. Many matrilines of Bigg's have been coming and going in Puget Sound and we had early morning report of northbound group (aside from southbound Ts) who may have originated further south in Puget Sound that Residents typically ever venture - alb

13:50-

13:55 -
Reporting: Today, Feb 2nd, around
1:50P to
1:55P at
Point No Point
(Hansville WA) 1/4 mile south of the Light House. Unreal, breath taking/stunning!!! - 30 to 50 meters directly out from me / directly across.
Four Orcas
!!! Trolling / feeding! The closet to the beach / me - Massive male via very high long dorsal fin - observed his distinctive white mark under massive dorsal fin many times as he trolled!! ...Afterwards I looked through online Orca Museum pics of the different male orcas - I'm 90% sure it was "J-27 Blackberry". However, I haven't found any solid pictures of "J-26 Mike" white marks under massive dorsal fin (found one, but it doesn't show much of his white / sense possibly much different than J-27 Blackberry). Also got a good view of one of the average size Orcas on the other side of the leader - guessing via pictures from Orca Museum either J-39 Mako or J-31 Tsuchi. Also read they are J-27 Blackberry siblings so was likely/possibly all three. The forth Orcas stayed underwater mostly/couldn't calculate size (and I primarily observing J-27 Blackberry as I was running - because he was right there ... 30 to 50 meters away with me all the way up the beach until we hit the Light house!!! Unreal moment!!! After the four Orcas trolled up to the Light House closely to the beach they turned and went directly out into deeper water. Watched them for another 3 to 4 minutes until they disappeared into the Salish abyss!! Unfortunately no J-Pod photos...heard from local fisherman lots of local Black Mouth / Chinook hang off that point) - off Point No Point Lighthouse area. -Andrew Muehling

Entry 14:
09:50 -
Gray? Whale
Redondo
. Appears to be gray whale moving fast to south. Very close to shore, within 100 feet of shore, barely south of of boat ramp. Turned in towards shore south boardwalk appt half mile. I'm not terribly good at identification but certainly not an orca. It wend about mile south. Feeding close in shore. Whirling up water. Birds all around picking up scraps. Spouted several times but could only see its back. Not even tail. Big. I'd guess more than 20 feet long and quite big around. Wasn't really a hump that stuck out to me but as I said I'm no expert. Hardly ever see orcas here. They favor Maury Is which is too far away to see. -Mark Eide
(
possibly humpback who was observed 2+ hours later to the south and has been traveling up and down the Sound regularly the past week - alb
)
*

Entry 15:
8-10 dolphins around
2:00PM
. Other viewers saw Orcas over near

reported as dolphins, but Terry was unsure. Probably Harbor porpoise seen and photo documented by Melissa Burke - alb
)

Porpoise
right off shore at
Chambers Bay
Northbound. -Melissa Burke
