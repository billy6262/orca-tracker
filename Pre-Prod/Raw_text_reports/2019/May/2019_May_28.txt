Orca Sightings for May 28, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Rare WHITE whale right outside Nanaimo! T46B1B a pale white/gray calf swims surrounded by her/his family members.
Beautiful encounter with this unique being!...Our tour on the 28th was filled with a ton of excitement! Not only did we get to see
two humpback whales, Heather and Raptor
, but we also had an amazing surprise right outside Nanaimo! While travelling back to the harbour we found a pod of orca which had a WHITE whale in it! -Excerpt from Vancouver Island Whale Watch

+/- from my house at
Kayak Point, Port Susan
...I
think it is Shackleton
...has been feeding here regularly since March. Lately, almost every day. Usually comes from the south, moves slowly towards Warm Beach. At low tide, the beach is covered with feeding pits. Here's another shot of the (I think) left top fluke showing the distinctive pattern. Also, she has an orange patch, sea lice, on her right side towards the front. Hope this helps. -Gary Lingenfelter

- Hi, Some type of whale just went past
Edmonds Beach
heading south. I can't tell what type it is. I have photos which I will add but they are not that great. (

A humpback (
photos above confirm
gray
- alb
) surfaced in the ferry lane just off the terminal in Edmonds just minutes before the ferry came in. I wonder if it was the same whale?...not certain it was a humpback. Big and dark and time-wise
5:50 pm is right on. -Tony Kliment

The ferry just hit the
whale in Elliott bay
!
20:30, another surface and movement, no big breath. No photos. We were on a roof in lower Queen Anne and saw it coming into the bay and surface a couple times. We have a really nice pair of binoculars and can see to wear Seattle quite well. It was mid bay, my friend was looking in the binoculars and asked if the whale could get all the way from the last sighting to the ferry. I said yeah, but probably a bouy bouncing in the wake. Then when I looked, it was indeed a literal fountain of blood. The ferry hit the whale.
It surfaced right in front of the ferry and then there was a fountain of blood and the whale was in the same spot for about 20 mins with visible bleeding and minimal breaths. Just kind of circles and flailed in the same spot.
Would have definitely noticed if it was bleeding that hard on initial sightings. They were normal surfacings and breaths. No other whales, and we were all commenting how glassy the water was, and no real small craft out to speak of in the bay. Just the ferry going to Bainbridge that it intercepted. There was nooo way the ferry captain would have seen it, it surfaced right into the bow of the vessel. You probably wouldn't have even seen it standing on the ferry deck behind the rope. It was a small humpback, humpback for sure. Not a grey, not a minke.

From
Olympic Sculpture Park at
8:10pm 8/28/19, we saw a gray?
Whale (
was the
humpback
- alb
) midway between Pier 71 & West Seattle! No pictures, no video, unfortunately. We thought gray because it was a quick arching surface unlike a more gliding surfacing of a humpback. Can`t recall a dorsal fin, definitely no orca-type dorsal fin: that, I think I would recall. Sorry, so vague, but definitely a whale. Too large for a seal, even a large one! -Cheers, Karen Janssen

...My family and I were aboard the

4:15pm
ferry from Seattle to Bremerton. According to my files, it appears this was at
4:45pm. We were passing Alki Point just near the
edge of Elliot Bay
. There was an announcement by the ferry staff that a "gray whale was spotted off the bow of the ship." Everyone clamored to see the whale rise to the surface of the waves - then go back down - then resurface again. These photos were taken on a Nikon 1 J3, with an AF-P Nikkor 70-300mm lens, using a FT1 converter which adds more zoom. The second set of photos were taken with the same equipment but in burst mode on the second time and third time the whale surfaced. I so wish it had breached so I could see more of it, but what I did see was still such a blessing. The photos unfortunately might not provide all the clues you all are looking for in the incident that happened several hours later, but I'm happy to share in case these help in some small way. What I did observe: a visible head or nose, some bursts of water...Warmest regards, Megan Burton

photos were sent to researchers and do
confirm humpback, but do not provide enough detail to confirm same humpback who was struck hours later
