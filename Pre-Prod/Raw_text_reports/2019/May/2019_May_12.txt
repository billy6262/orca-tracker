May 12 - It seemed only fitting that yesterday on Mother's Day one of our trips was spent in the company of
a mom and calf pair of humpback whales
. The mom,
Slate (BCX1210), was found with a calf near Victoria, BC,
allowing us to also share the awesomeness of Race Rocks Ecological Reserve with our guests, which included the resident sea otter Ollie! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Maya's Legacy

May 12 - Eastern Juan de Fuca Strait - I posted on fb about not missing the whales yesterday and was asked to send in any shots I may have gotten. These aren't the best quality and are heavily cropped from 600mm focal point. I hope though that it will help with identification. These were taken at Joseph Whidbey State park on 5-12-19 between

1:30 pm/
2:00 pm
. I don't really know what it was doing but I'm going to assume eating. It stayed for a bit in this area diving and coming back up with lots of blows. Again I hope these photos help and I would love to hear back on what kind of whale (grey I assume) and who it may be. -Thank you, Jamie Bartram
