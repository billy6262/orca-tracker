Orca Sightings for May 25, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
I love the stillness of the soft rain/mist/fog on the water and lower Olympic foothills. the blues and gray colors and the quiet sounds of nothing, except the exhalations of the
orcas slowly making their way out of of Admiralty Straits
...This family/pod consists of
four whales Mama T101 and her boys T101A, T101B, and T102
...mama's got her hands full and she does a pretty darn good job. -Photo by Marilyn Armbruster,

Just sighted them at
5:35 pm as well, between 1 mi.
S of Bush Point
and the Ruby Princess - glad the fog and clouds finally cleared! -Susan Berta, Orca Netowrk

Headed to south Whidbey to find orca without much hope thanks to the rain and fog. But then they came around the corner. I love the big boys so three of them together made my heart swoon. As they passed by,
Ellie the elephant seal
, startled everybody on the beach by coming down from behind us, no one realized she was there, and heading straight into the water as the
101s + 102 passed by 500 yards away
. They showed no interest in hunting, though, likely full from an earlier feast of a gray whale. A much needed encounter with orca.

17:36 - northbound approaching Windmill heights area
. Passengers on the cruise ship Ruby Princess should get a nice look at these whales!

17:10 - T101s northbound past Limpet Lane
, south end Mutiny. Close to Whidbey. -Rachel Haight

Entry 5:
T101 pod just west of Cultus Bay
, south Whidbey Island. This is a unique pod comprised of 4 transient killer whales, including a Mother, T101, and her three big adult male sons, T101A, T101B, and T102. The sons are 26yrs old, 22 years old, and 35 years old, respectively. It was immediately obvious upon arrival that the
killer whales were circling around some kind of prey
. We had seen this same family an hour and a half beforehand just a few miles southeast at Possession Point on our first whale watching trip of the day, and they were spread out in a typical hunting pattern.
After watching the family circle around for quite a while, we eventually saw a flurry of activity at the surface with the pod and then
the body of a gray whale came up
. The killer whales circled around the body as it floated. Shortly thereafter a bunch of air with blood spurted and bubbled out of the gray whale carcass and then the whale slowly sank under the water again while the T101s continued to work on their meal. We did see several tail lobs, tail slaps, and a cartwheel after the body came up to the surface. These are behaviors we often see during transient meals or afterward. To see more photos of this encounter, read a more detailed account, or to see any updates that might come from conversations with whale biologists please visit Bart Rulon's blog post on Puget Sound Express's website at https://www.pugetsoundexpress.com/may-25-encounter-with-t101-biggs-orcas-dead-gray-whale/
This is an unusual occurrence in our area to see a killer whale family feeding on a gray whale. We have witnessed half hearted attacks of transient killer whales on some of our regular "Sounders" in the past but never have we seen an attack succeed. Its likely impossible to identify the whale from the pictures photographer/naturalist Bart Rulon was able to obtain during the experience because so much of the skin was peeled off the gray whale. We do not believe the gray whale in question was one of our regular "Sounder" group of grays that regularly visits us in the spring time, partly because of the apparent smaller size of the body and because of the short amount of time it likely took the pod to kill the whale (less than an hour and a half). This is assuming they killed the whale and it didn't pass away on its own beforehand, which is also a distinct possibility
This year we have seen an unusual amount of new, unidentified, gray whales showing up in the Salish Sea, and Puget Sound. It has also been a year with higher than usual gray whale mortality. It is speculated that the gray whale eaten by the T101 pod might have been a new unidentified gray whale that had been seen in the vicinity of Edmonds and the south end of Whidbey Island over the last week or two appearing to be sluggish, subadult size, and very skinny. -Photographer/Naturalist Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

Entry 6:
First spotted T102, T101B and T101A near shoreline just south of Edmonds, going south
. This was

11:30 AM
,
May 25 (we were on the Puget Sound Express, which stayed 200 yards away). Whales initially were just hanging around in front of Edmonds, going back and forth. By

12:15 they were heading north
, towards the center of the navigation channel. We passed them on our right heading back to P.T. -Cyrilla Cook

Entry 7:
*
So the
T101 pod was eating a gray whale when we saw them off Indian Point earlier around

3:30-
4:00.
ID of the whale would not be very easy because much of the skin was peeled off during the meal, and the gray was upside down most of the time. We did not see the kill, just the aftermath. I will send pics to Cascadia. (see report and images above). -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express
*

14:58 - T101s.
Now off
Indian Point
, just off Scatchet Head on the south western corner.whidbey, milling. -Trevor Tillman
*

12:45 -
Amidst the squall,
T101s
continue north mid channel between
S Edmonds and Apple Tree Cove Point
. Too early to discern if angling Admiralty or Possession. Good luck, you may want to bring your bumbershoots & vinyl boots!

12:22- T101s
are mid channel sightline from and between Kayu Kayu Ac Park, Shoreline and Kinsgston Ferry dock. Grouped up steady northbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

11:28 - T101s
Currently aiming more towards the mainland side about even with
Carkeek
probably.

11:20 T101 pod
currently grouped up and northbound, mid channel
a mile north of Shilshoe
. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

11:23 -
Still seeing them from sunset hill. They are slowly traveling north. Last seen a little north of the whale watching boat pretty much due
west of golden gardens
. Mid channel closer to Bainbridge.

10:56 - Watching from sunset hill
. They are
west of shilshole
mid channel between the whale watching boat and the sailboat. -Lindsay Walker
*

10:22 -
Watching from
Golden gardens
. I think they are midchannel near the whale watching vessel. -Marlena Skrobe

09:30 - At least three in front of centennial park/lower Queen Anne
. Close to lower Queen Anne side. Trending slowly north toward Smith Cove. -Stephen Sommerfeld
*

09:36 - Off Elliot Bay Marina
now...No direction but trending out..
09;30 - T102
, adult Male of the T101 matriline, was making his way into
Elliot bay
with three trailing behind about 100 yards. A boat came out and crossed in front of him, the group then disappeared and then changed direction, eventually leaving the bay.

09:20 - Stalled out in a dive at grain elevators
.. close to that side still heading into bay. From Anchor Park, West Seattle. Around

9:30 heading towards grain elevato
r. From Anchor Park, WS - T102 has a characteristic left leaning dorsal, pictured here; looks as if he is traveling out of the bay(because of flop) but is actually traveling in. -Photos by Kersti Muul,

UNCONFIRMED SPECIES - Sat

Entry 16:
Cliffside RV park (West Whidbey, on the NAS)
this
afternoon and evening
at sunset...Looked like small brown ridged islands after they spouted. Could have been two or three of them about cause there were spouts very close together in time and a ways away from each other. Pretty neat for us. -Linda Clary
