I just read your post from 3hrs ago today about feeding locations of Grays; I can't tell if it is
2 or 3
but I am up on the cliff at
West Beach and there have been grays here since this morning
. I didn't take a photo because I am so high up it's not clear. -Tammy Thompson

Today was one of the most beautiful days I've seen on the great Salish Sea. We found a
gray whale
...I think the same one from Saturday)
near NAS Whidbey
, Steller Sea Lions, two very cooperative puffins, a lot of very pregnant harbor seals, and two very elusive minkes around Eastern Bank. -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 4:
Hat island where we found gray whale #49 Patch
swimming around
with another large gray whale
. Neither of the whales were having to dive deep as they fed off the shallows of Hat island. From there we headed south a little ways toward the
Mukilteo ferry crossing where we found 3 more gray whales. Gray whale #56
and one other whale were hanging out together and were soon joined by another gray whale that was not identified. We got great looks at this group as one of the whales was hanging out at the surface for long periods of time and they even came over to check out the boat. As they branched off toward the Snohomish River delta we moved off to join up with one more lone gray whale. This time it was
#723 Lucy
and he was headed into the shallows off of Hat island. We got a few lazy fluke shots from Lucy before he began to head north and we had to make our way south. On our way back toward Everett we came across Patch and his friend for a few last looks with the sun pouring down like crazy. It was a spectacular day on the water and our trip was very successful with all sorts of different wildlife encounters!!! -Tyson, Island Adventures,
