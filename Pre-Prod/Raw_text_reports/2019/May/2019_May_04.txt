(I think) in Burrows Bay south of Anacortes. Not really moving in any direction, seems to be feeding...Spotted from land. Close to shore. Seems to be staying in this area and heading up and down the coast a bit. Saw it slowly head north toward Anacortes last night around
7:30, and now it's back. We've seen it in the
same spot for 2 days now

Hello Alisa and Friends at Orca Network, Had a great day out Saturday,
May 4th, with PS Express (RedHead) out of Port Townsend with Bonnie. Meliss and I saw our first
Minke in the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
(about 48째17'58.9"N 123째03'42.5"W). We also saw
a few Grays off of the bluff on West Beach Road
off Whidbey. Unfortunately no Orcas however great day with Bonne, Coleen and Chris. -David Haeckel

Likely feeding in that area, down for very long times and surfacing for only a quick second.

11:45 - Gray whale
appears to be headed back south now.

11:37 - Gray whale
appears to have slowed down but still moving north. I also recorded that last down time - nearly 11 minutes!

10:30 - Gray
appears to be headed north. No camera on me so no pics, but definitely not the same whale at Keystone the other day.
