They (
orcas

12:36 - Orcas
to the right of the ferry heading to Seattle! We were leaving
Bainbridge
and they were headed towards West Seattle. The ferry captain made an announcement! -Sue Bolinger
*

11:55 - Orca
. straight offshore from
Eagle Harbor
, mid-channel at least maybe a bit closer to
Alki
side. Hard to get a picture even with telephoto lens, but looks like they might be feeding - lots of circling, splashing, and jumping. -Jim Reitz
*

11:45 - Small pod of orcas
off the Walla Walla ferry from
Seattle to Bainbridge
. Captain said he could see two babies with the group....e were about 3/4 of the way across from Seattle. The outgoing ferry from Bainbridge had just made the turn. This photo from my cell shows how close we were to the island. -Sandy Pavey
*

11:49 -
Seattle to Bainbridge Ferry is stopped. Looks like they're feeding, circling around, right in the ferry lane- mid channel

11:37 -
Finally see them- north of
Elliott Bay still SB
. More east side sound. -Becca tiger Musser
*

11:25 - Orcas
visible thru binoculars from
Eagle Harbor
, well offshore. Approaching ferry lanes, looks like whale watching boat trailing behind them. -Jim Reitz
*

11:00 -
Approaching
Yeomalt Point
southbound in the middle of the sound doing long dives. -Christopher Hanke, Puget Sound express
*
0910:
San Juan Clipper left orcas southbound at buoy SF. 6 individuals, our naturalist said
T65A's
I believe. (SF buoy is the yellow mid channel buoy
between Richmond Beach in Shoreline and President's Point, Kingston
, Kitsap peninsula - alb) -James Greenway
*
Given their size and power, one can sometimes forget that Killer Whales are also dolphins. Other times, their playfulness and curiosity shine through, such as today when the
T65As
attempted to ride the bow wave of the San Juan Clipper near
Kingston
! We had to stop and shut down our engines when they suddenly appeared so close after a long dive, perhaps spoiling their fun...Justine Buckmaster
*
We saw them
(orcas) on the Kingston
Fast Ferry this morning, just south of Apple Tree Cove maybe 300 yards off shore. One looked like a baby! -Andrea Mojzak
*

07:17 -
Good morning! More
orcas
this morning from the
Kingston
Fast Ferry. Grabbed some coordinates from my phone this morning, they were further north, just outside of Kingston...We were also closer this morning and I spotted 3 at one specific time, again I'm not an expert so hate to call out if there was a male or not. They did however seem to be circling/feeding. 47°47'15.7"N 122°28'26.2"W (47.787696, -122.473952). -Tim Hunt
*

06:27 -
Marie at WS Ferries Ops called to relay report: one of their deck officers just reported about
6-7 whales, just off of Apple Tree Cove Point
. Couldn't tell which type, they appeared to be feeding.

Entry 5:

Tonight around
6:00PM I saw a
Gray dive off of Washington Par
k, maybe a juvenile?...this gray was traveling west from Guemes Channel into Rosario. -Lisa Allison Blohm
*
Anacortes - What a wonderful day to be out on the water! We left the marina and headed through Guemes channel when a few passangers thought that they had spotted a spout right
off the coast of Anacortes
in the middle of the channel. We waited for a few minutes before we saw the spot again from a distance and then saw
a Gray whale
! We stayed with this little gray whale for quite some time and got to see it fluke twice! After we left the gray whale we went along the coast line of WA park and went towards Whidbey Island where we had reports of
Orca whales off of Lawson Reef!
Once we arrived on scene, we were able to ID these as
T87, T90's, and T123's!
We spent some quality cruising time with these marine mammal eating orcas before they went into resting mode and we left the scene to go meet up with one of our favorite
humpbacks, Scratchy
, who was just five minutes away from the Orcas! From a distance we saw Scratchy breach out of the water before we were on scene and once we got on scene we got to see him breach one more time and cartwheel out of the water! We also got to see the humpback fluke multiple times. We then made our way through Deception Pass and then made our short journey back into Guemes Channel. Just as we were about to make the turn back into the marina, a guest said he saw the gray whale again and sure enough the same whale we were with earlier had popped up right outside the marina! We got to see the little whale fluke a few more times before we turned back into home base. It was overall an AWESOME day with wildlife around every corner! -Clare, Island Adventures
*
-Watched a single 50-60'
Grey Whale swim through Burrows Bay off Anacortes
, WA this morning around
10 am
. It swam very close along the shoreline following our morning low tide. It passed along the Skyline Marina entrance and hovered along an inlet near
Washington Park
before heading out towards Guemes Channel. It was so white and splotchy with huge barnacles on its body that we could follow it under water without binoculars as it passed by. I don't have pictures but will never forget it's impressive blow hole sound and spray to match. -Denise Root

Entry 6:
17:50 -
While searching for the possible incoming orcas I spotted
two gray whales exiting Admiralty Inlet!
Frist sighting they surfaced in tandem about 1/2-1 mile west of Point Wilson mid channel. Saw them one more surface intervel a few minutes later continuing west, a bit spread apart. From
Ebey's Landing
, too far for IDs or photos. Perhaps two of the Sounders leaving? -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

12:44 - Definitely grays. Two travelling together.
Making decent time. Approaching
south Marrowstone Island in Admiralty Inlet
. Pattern of two blows then a deep dive with fluke.

12:37 - Two whales (possibly grays)
, north bound near the buoy south of
Marrowstone Island
. -Margaret Marshall

May 16 - Possession Sound - Everett - Our Everett season is drawing to a close with just a few tours left, but the gray whale action hasn't slowed at all! The wildlife sightings started before we even boarded, with a curious harbor seal popping up during our crew introductions to say "hello"! As we left and headed out past Jetty Island, it was a bird-of-prey bonanza with at least four mature bald eagles and a pair of osprey. One of the eagles caught a snack and the osprey did its best to snatch it away (to no avail). There were plenty of California sea lions near the Navy base, and shortly after that - our first whale of the day! We quickly realized however, that it was not just a single whale, but
gray whales galore as we counted at least five in the area between Everett and Hat Island. The nearest whales were identified as #49 Patch, #21 Shackleton, and #22 Earhart.
These whales were among the earliest to discover the rich feeding grounds off Everett nearly 30 years ago, so it was great to see them (and smell them!) thriving in these waters. For a change of scenery, we headed down south of the Mukilteo ferry lane and found another gray whale,
#44 Dubknuck
, who showed us our first flukes of the day! We saw his tail at least three times and it seemed he was making his way north toward the rest of the whales. On the way back we caught up with our first whales again, including a special goodbye from Shackleton again. This was my last Everett tour of the season and it seemed only appropriate that the last gray whale of the tour was the first one to visit this area back in 1990. -Erin, Island Adventures

San Juan Clipper saw
#22
, we just left her at
0954
on the SE end of
Gedney headed SE
. -James Greenway
*
On the
7am
Clinton to Mukilteo,
a couple spouting
, but no visible bodies. -Kristen Wagner-Patterson
*

07:05 -
another call from WS Ferries, this time Mike re: Mukilteo/Clinton Route. One of their crew reports
6 gray whales spouting north of ferry lanes
towards Gedney Island and it is really beautiful.
(
response from Lori Christopher to WSF sighting above: "Saw and heard three whales pass the east side of Gedney, southbound just after sunset last night. They do this just about every night. I'm guessing they gather and spend the night together in that area?"
)
