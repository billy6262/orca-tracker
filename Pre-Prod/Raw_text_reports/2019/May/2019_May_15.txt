Entry 2:
20:00 - T65A family
cleared
Saratoga
faster than anticipated. Spotted them again just outside south end of Saratoga Passage. Some lazy tail lobs, many directional changes. One fine moment: Mom & siblings went one way, little one
T65A6
went the opposite...pretty cute. After all that they regrouped and are heading east very slowly. Not sure which side of Hat/Gedney they'll choose. Half dozen Harbor seals hugging the shore, eagle feasting on someone, crows cawing not happy about that, heron & swallows soaring above. Ducklings paddling in water flat calm. I could hear the orcas blow in the distance. This place...

18:24 - T65As south of Fox Spit
still slowly southbound heading towards Langley, Whidbey side of channel. Family grouped with
T65A2 and T65A3
traveling together flagging behind for a short time then rejoining the others...some tail lobs, inverted rolls. Rainy, but water is very calm. Nice viewing conditions.

Finally

An unknown
gray whale
swims under the cliffs of
Sharpe Park, Anacortes
. -Frame grab from video by Charmaine Delmatier,

Entry 4:
*
Sighting this morning. I was at hiking at
Sharpe Park
point and saw this solitary baby whale from the cliff. I highly suspect it's not an orca, but could it be
either a gray (probably) or humpback (unlikely)?
I never saw any other whales, which makes Hope the mother was swimming deeper the entire time I saw the baby on water's surface...The whale was the size of an orca or smaller, that's why I thought it was a baby. Sharpe Park is just Southwest of Anacortes, might even be in the city limits. It's just north of Deception Pass bridge. Thanks for your help, I'd like to know. -Charmaine Delmatier

May 15 - What's better than a whale trifecta? How about seeing all four of the Salish Sea's main whale species in one trip?? That's exactly what happened today on the Chilkat Express! We encountered
Gray Whale #22 Earhart in Possession Sound, Transient Killer Whale family T65As in Saratoga Passage, Humpback Whale "Scratchy" at Lawson Reef just outside Deception Pass, and at least 4 Minke Whales actively and collectively feeding on a huge bait ball just north of Partridge Bank
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca to top it all off! What an amazing day!! -Justine Buckmaster

Gray 44 Dubknuck
surface just out from the beach, still making his way steady northbound close to Whidbey in regular surface intervals as he disappeared around the bend.

44 Dubknuck off Possession Beach Park

11:00 -
We moved to
Possession Beach Park
to the south and along came those porpoise, still porpoising.
Gray 531
followed a short time later now much closer to Whidbey. She passed in front of us approx 100 yards off shore steady travel pace with more frequent shallow surfaces that earlier. Her travel interrupted by a boat maneuvering in her path then following her so she moved offshore. She continued steady southbound towards Possession Point.

PORPOISE - Wed

Entry 11:
pod of Harbor porpoise (~25-30+)
made up of adults w/some calves porpoising at high speed southbound out from us at
Glendale, Whidbey Island
- no predators in the vicinity. We then moved ~ 2 miles south down the shoreline to Possession Beach Park to wait for the gray and along came the pod of porpoising porpoise....still porpoising! This is the 2nd time in the last week I've seen large pod of porpoise porpoising for extended period of time. Crappy but show these awesome little creatures rooster-tailing it down Possession Sound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
