12:55 - T65As exited Commencement Bay
very close to

After still looking like they were hunting someone (directional changes, lunges, & drifting north spread out0, They are now grouped
heading westbound towards Brown's Point
with purpose.

RARE!
Gray Whale at Stillwater Bluffs near Powell River on Sunshine Coast BC Canada
. Couurtesy Tideline to Alpine Photography & Adventure. Instagram: @tidelinetoalpine: I am so grateful to have witnessed this majestical Gray Whale up close and personal yesterday while enjoying an afternoon at Stillwater Bluffs on the Sunshine Coast. We also watched schools of fish, jellyfish and sea stars from our seaside perch and had a visit from the Sea Lions nearby which you can hear in the video. Definately a great way to connect with nature and get to know a new friend. This encounter had me giddy with excitement and I hope it brightens your day as well.." FACEBOOK VIDEO -Thanks for sharing!
