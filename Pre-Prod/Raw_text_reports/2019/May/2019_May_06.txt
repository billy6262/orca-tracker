Season's greetings to the
resident Orcas
, nice to see them again. Pod traveling east to west on Monday,
May 6th. Several orcas were close to island in
Flint Bay
, Lopez Island. Lots of breaching and tail slaps. Most boats doing a good job of not interfering with orcas, one commercial smaller boat was right in main orca pathway though...Sally Reeve

May 6 - Possession Sound...It wasn't long after we entered Possession Sound that we a clustering of gray whales at the southern end of
Hat Island
. It turned out to be
a group of five, #49, #22, #723, among them.
They were socializing in a way that the crew had seldom seen before, so tightly grouped that all whales could have been touching, and rolling at the surface of the water, pec fins and flukes visible above the surface as they rolled. Was love in the air? We may never know for sure, but it certainly seemed plausible...The gray whales were back to their social antics by the time we returned to Hat Island. By this time we confirmed that
#22, #49, #53, #56, #531, and possibly #383
were all present. The most incredible part of this second encounter had to have been when Earhart #22 mugged the boat! She seemed content to just hangout right beside us, and as we drifted with engines shut off, she circled the back of the boat. You could count the barnacles on her face, and see her full contour beneath the waterline. An unreal end to a truly remarkable day on the water. -Island Adventures.
