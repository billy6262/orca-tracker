Hi there, Someone on the Sooke Whale Watching facebook page suggested sending our photos of the grey whale that was spotted to you today for identification. This whale was in the
Sooke basin (photo taken from Whiffin Spit)
around
noon
on
May 17, 2019. I do not have the best camera (and had my 7 month old strapped to me in a carrier) so was not able to get the best shots, but was able to snap these few photos which may help in identification. -Lora Wendorf
