HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun

Entry 2:
12:34 -
We spotted a
humpback in Burrows Bay Anacortes
. I saw a side view of it & it looked like a humpback to me, we were not at all close so taking that into consideration. We didn't have time to hang out or I would have taken pictures, hopefully on our way back it will still be there and we'll have time to get a little closer. It's fluke was pretty small. -Debby Giard

Entry 6:
T65As -
Started with another
Transient Killer Whale
predation event! I didn't get photos of the
T65As
playing with their food, but the playful behavior continued well after the meal ended and I did manage to get one of two spyhops from one year old T65A6! Later, we got a glimpse of
Minke Whales
(not pictured) at Partridge Bank and Tufted Puffins near Smith Island! Finally, after cruising through Deception Pass, we met up with
Gray Whales #22 Earhart and #49 Patch near Hat/Gedney Island
. -Justine Buckmaster
