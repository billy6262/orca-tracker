Orca Sightings for May 22, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
4 orcas this afternoon at the end of Singing Sands Road, Comox
(right beside the ferry terminal) - someone on our local network says on is T124A1...They were travelling, passed 3 sea lions about 100 feet away and showed no interest (the sea lions on the other hand were quite distressed and shouting loudly!). Photos taken wit an iPhone through my Kowa spotting scope - animals were about 150 feet off the shore (where the water drops off) and continued south. Curious as to who they are. (
T75B, T124A1, T86A1, and T75C
were ID from photos shared with Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research, a few of them below - alb
) -Ross Griffith-Cochrane

Entry 2:
Possession/Saratoga Passage
- Hi Alisa, We had a huge treat this afternoon with this group of
orcas - T65As - at Pebble Beach. There were six of them
, coming from the north. They seemed focused on the little bay on the north side of the point, almost looked like they were fishing. There were two groups, one of 2 and the other 4. It looked like they were either playing or feeding on the salmon that hand out here. We only figured out the salmon when the otters came up after the orcas left, with salmon in their mouths. #17 is blurry, but it looks like one of the otters has a nice salmon in his mouth. Our biggest mystery other than not identifying them, is what they are doing in #14. Can't ID the grey animal they are circling. I have many more photographs of this encounter, as it continued from

4:50 pm to
6:45
. They seemed to be either feeding or just playing. I'd love to know who these lovely beings are, if you can tell. I've lightened up the photos to attempt but I still can't tell...Peg Boley
