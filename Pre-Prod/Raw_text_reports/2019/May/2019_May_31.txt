Orca Sightings for May 31, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fri
May 31 - Got to meet the little white one today! One of the coolest groups on the coast. Here are some shots of little
T046B1B with it's real bleached appearance
, the cause of which is unknown. Hopefully something like leucism rather than Chediak-Higashi syndrome so this little white whale has a greater chance of surviving into adulthood.
T046B1B between mom, T046B1 and the other new calf in the matriline, T046B6.
