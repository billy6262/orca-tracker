Orca Sightings for May 11, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
northwest tip of Saltspring Island
we turned south down Houstoun Passage and around the bottom of Kuper Island into
Stuart Channel
as we heard they were milling mid channel between Chemanius and Kuper Island. We arrived at
1546
(48 55.1/123 39.2) to see the
T123's a half mile to the west of the T086A's
and both groups traveling slowly south bound. Within a few minutes the 086A's started to mill as if they had found a seal and the T123's soon joined them. -Full report with images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 33

Just saw backlit blows in Possession Sound. Right
off Clinton Ferry Dock
and very close in. I didn't see any fins so
presume baleen whale (Gray)
and looked to be moving to the southeast. LOTS of boats out there. Everyone be whale wise! -Debbie Stewart

Entry 3:
at least two gray whales in the waters off of NAS Whidbey
's Cliffside rv park at about

10:30
this morning (Sat 5/11/19). They stayed in pretty much the same location and would dive down then surface at about the same place so I think they were feeding. There was quite a crowd of campers watching them. One man told me he had been seeing one every evening for the past 5-6 days. I watched the whales for about half an hour and they were still there when I left. It was foggy when I set out on my walk on the trail this morning so I did not have my camera to get pictures of them. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! -Mary Jo Adams

Elliott Bay
! Playing a little bit north east of shipping and ferry channels, about 400 yards offshore in front of Olympic sculpture park, heading north to Interbay/Magnolia. What a beautiful day! -Dana Reinert

May 11 - As I scanned to the west back towards Tumbo Island I saw the back of a humpback whale. We worked our way back to the west and came across
a pair of humpback whales (BCY0160/"Heather" and BCY00458/"Raptor") at 1055
(48 48.3/123 02.8). They were traveling tight together making less than 2 knots north west bound against the strong ebb current. They circled towards the shoreline of Tumbo Island and seemed to be feeding in the area. -Full report with images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 33
*
From there we continued into Canadian waters, and it was just
north of Tumbo Island that we came across two humpback whales
! It turned out to be
Raptor and Heather
, two known associates. It was beautiful to see these two socializing, swimming side by side throughout the afternoon. Even more interesting is seeing them back together in 2019, given that they were somewhat inseparable during 2018! -Excerpted from Island Adventures
