Orca Sightings for March 26, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
"Ken called Dave at home in the late morning to relay a report that
J pod had been found heading slowly down Boundary Pass
. Dave grabbed his gear, headed to the boat, and left Snug Harbor around 1145ish. "Orcinus" got to the general area in Boundary Pass around 1215 but the whales were so spread out that it was
1230
before the first whales were seen and encountered. The first group encountered was
J36, J41, and J51
and they were about halfway between Blunden Island and Johns Pass.
J17 and J53.
The threesome were socializing as they fast traveled east toward White Rock..." -Full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 23.

Hi Alisa! Wow! You had a very busy day yesterday, thank you for being so diligent to update the threads! Here are some pics from the two groups that came up
Colvos Passage
yesterday as viewed from Vashon shores. The daytime pics are from the smaller pod that came up around 2ish, and the evening ones are when the others came through around 7ish. The were much closer to the Kitsap side, so the pics are not that great and heavily cropped, but oh how beautiful they were to watch! Especially the huge merged pods that blazed through in the late evening with the gorgeous backlit blows, making them look even more magical than they already are. -Marla Smith

I took these photos around

orca
they were behind my house on
Henderson Bay
. (47.3680034, -122.6770985) My neighbor saw them coming in East toward Purdy and when they left. I saw them heading west only. They seemed to stay in a circle a good distance out in the bay. They were circling something when I first saw them. I could hear them as well. I did not see a large fin (male ?). There were 5 together with a young one, and two more just behind them. They were not in a hurry. -Terry Shovlowsky
