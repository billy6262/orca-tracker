15:07 - Possibly the T123s coming down Swanson
...confirmed T123s, including the calf! -Monika Wieland Shields
*

Entry 2:
Later reports have orcas/blows in two areas several miles apart heading in opposite directions, it is possible a 2nd group was in other than the
T99s

17:35 -
Viewing from Maxwelton. See blows between here and
Point no Point northwest bound
. Hopefully some folks at Pt no Pt can see them....Marilyn Armbruster
*

17:22 -
I swear I saw them south bound closing to the Edmonds side but only saw them once and can't find again... 3 and heading south at a good clip about 10 minutes ago from my kitchen table. -Michelle Goll
*

16:35 -
Last I saw blows they looked to be
2-3 miles south of Scatchet Head heading NW toward Admiralty Inlet at about
16:25
. I then moved to Stamm Overlook could not relocate them as of
16:35

16:09 -
I finally spotted blows (3-4 in succession) to the
west of Edmond
s a few miles and south of Whidbey 1.5-2 miles (sightline from Haines Wharf with some elevation is just
north of Point No Poin
t at horizon). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

15:39 -
Spotted group due west of
Picnic Point
mid Channel...I'm using binox and they're at the horizon line, so far away, but lots of activity, stationary...they seem to be due south of the nearest landmass which is Whidbey....There looks like 50 gulls swarming above what appears to be a very productive hunting site. -Alex Ho
*

14:45 - orcas
nearing Shipwreck (Lynd across from
Possession Beach
park still Mukilteo side of mid channel southbound. -Marilyn Armbruster

Glendale heading south
still on Mukilteo side.

13:40 - Whales south of Hat Island heading towards Everett
grouped up. -Sandra Pollard

. Viewing from my living room on extended lunch (don't tell the boss!) -Debbie Stewart
*
...The excitement didn't end there, though, we also had a brief encounter with
Killer Whales! The T99s
were also in a social mood after sharing a kill near
Sandy Point on Whidbey Island

Entry 3:

From today- Part 2: Killer whales: Gray whale trips aren't always only about grays. We got super lucky today with
a pod of killer whales
reported further north, but southbound, earlier in the morning. We were running short on time, but when we realized how close they actually could be, we went for it! Upon our arrival, there were 4 whales that I was able to identify as the
T99's -T99B's
narrow, notchy dorsal is a dead giveaway. Birds were flying overhead and the whales were already heavily into prey sharing with head stands, moon-walking and converging in one area. Just when it looked like they were about to move on, they continued feeding and we were treated to a spyhop....which I saw but failed to get a photo of (boo). Despite that, it was a pretty amazing first day back.
-Matriarch T99 (born 1984), T99B (born 2007), Siblings T99C and D are carrying the kill while T99B trails behind, likely picking up pieces

Entry 4:
12:45 - ID'd as T99s, pod of 4 is stalled out on hunt/meal south of Sandy Point,
Whidbey. -Renee Beitzel
*

12:16 - A pod of 3 Orcas
are heading south towards the ferry from
Sandy point
in Saratoga passage. -Debra Rack
*

10:30 -
...my family is on vacation in Langley and we saw three orca this morning. One went ahead and two were behind. We're on
Bells Beach
. It was at
10:30 this morning and they were heading south. -Erin Taylor

Fri Mar 8 - Pax were fun, weather was mostly sunny, albeit chilly, and whales did not disappoint! Part 1: Grays - We started with gray whales
#49 Patch
who was resting by himself near Gedney Island while
#53 Little Patch and #185
were off on their own, having some kind of "bromance" off the edge of the Snohomish River Delta...that is a very technical term (see sarcasm) for when the males of a species are associating so closely and spending all of their time together but away from everyone else who may be in the area. Also, we know dolphins (like killer whales) like to engage in that sort of behavior, but it is not likely that is what these two were doing. They were VERY closely socializing while waiting out the tide near Everett. Prominent dorsal ridge and knuckles with small white patch on #53 Little Patch (I call him LP for short) and then #185 with more subtle dorsal ridge and knuckles, comparatively. #185 - I noted last season that his blowhole surface is much more flat than the rest. Its one way to tell these two apart when you can't see anything else. They are both on the darker side of gray, but have very different markings on their backs and flukes. Even the fluke shapes are different! Top fluke of #185 showing "flared" edges, another unique attribute. After all, he is not truly a "Sounder"...yet. -Photos by Renee Beitzel, Mar 8, 2019

First day of the season! I think it's safe to say our first Gray Whale trip of 2019 was a success! We saw
three Gray Whales
resting and socializing between Hat/Gedney Island and Everett;
#49 Patch, #53 Little Patch, and #185
. It was interesting to see #53 Little Patch and #185 closely associating and likely socializing with each other since they are technically from different populations of Gray Whale! The excitement didn't end there, though, we also had a brief encounter with Killer Whales! The
T99s
were also in a social mood after sharing a kill near Sandy Point on Whidbey Island. I hope this is a good sign for the rest of the season.

Entry 5:
11:45 - I believe what I saw this morning at
11:45am was maybe a Bottlenose Dolphin?
Saw the same thing about a week ago. The photos are not great because they are very far away with my telephoto lens....Saw off Apple Tree Point near Kingston, heading south at quick rate, just cruising. -Photos by Mark Vigna
(
ID notes Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "It's definitely a dolphin, best guess is bottlenose, but can't be certain that it's a bottlenose, much less Stump. The dorsal fin doesn't look right for her, but it could be the angle".
