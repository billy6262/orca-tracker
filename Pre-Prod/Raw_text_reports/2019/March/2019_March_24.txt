Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES (OUTSIDE INLAND PUGET SOUND) -

13:12 - T49As in Boundary Pass
. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Entry 2:
~
9:30am
- We were leaving
Fossil bay at Sucia and motoring towards Matia
. At first I thought they were actually Dalls porpoise as they seemed so small to me and the fin on the one didn't look right. They must have been hunting fish as the birds were circling them the whole time. I'm guessing from our photos there were 4 of them? We never saw more than 3 at a time but the one fin again is different and isn't in the shot of the three whales together. The biggest thing that struck me again is how small they seemed. Is it possible that one was a baby? I hear about transient pods - do you think this would be a transient pod because of the location? I've attached three photos of the whales and a map with a circle where we saw them. They probably hung out for about 10 minutes. -Jessica Heidemann

The eternal struggle. Predator vs prey. A doomed harbor seal fights for it's life during an intense predation event with the
T137's
in
Saratoga Passage
yesterday. The seal tried to reach Island Explorer 5 and use the boat for cover. It was cut off about 15 feet away and the battle took place at intimate close range.

Orcas
we saw in Saratoga Passage this morning

9:33 - Orcas currently between Whidbey (north of ferry dock) and Hat Island
. They have really picked up the pace and are moving fast now. Traveling north.

09:20 - Orcas
are still basically in the same place. Straight out
from the Clinton ferry dock
. They seem more committed to traveling and are currently heading straight towards the southeast corner of Gedney Island.

09:02 -
I currently counted
8 orcas with 2 males
...Oh my gosh. It's so amazing. They have all grouped up and are surfacing at the same time.

08:55 - Orcas
must have made a kill. Lots of bird activity. They are now grouped together in what looks like a resting line pointed
between whidbey island and gedney island
. Currently straight out from the south Clinton ferry dock heading north.

08:37 -
Update. I am now seeing
4-5 orcas
. Directional changes. Just
north of the Clinton ferry lanes
.

08:33 -
Good morning,
one male orca heading north of the Clinton ferry lanes towards Everett

Sun Mar 24 - Hi there! A small pod of approx five orcas passed very close to shore along the north and
east side of Piers Island (Sidney, BC)
, heading south, yesterday (
March 24) around

6:00pm
. An earlier pod (or portion of this pod...) passed by a little further out between Piers and Portland around
5:30pm. Also headed south. I've been told that they are likely transients based on their fin shape. Also, there appeared to be a young whale in the group. Please let me know if I can provide any further information. Photos attached - they were taken from my deck. This is the first pod I have seen go past our house in a awhile. ..Jake Clark (email)

March 24 - The last two or three days have been chaotic keeping up with whales. When Glacier Spirit Puget Sound Express departed Langley at
11:00 am on Sunday,
March 24, we anticipated encountering transient orca pods the
T46s and T137s
in addition to a number of gray whales - and were not disappointed. A short time after leaving the marina we came across the
orcas, somewhat spread out, heading towards Fox Spit
. A quick turnabout to the Camano side of Saratoga Passage led us to
Saratoga gray # 22 (Earhart)
before we continued south past Hat Island where
more gray whales, including #49 (Patch) and #53 (Little Patch)
were socializing and feeding. If there's such a term as 'whaled out' then we were - happily so! (Photos Richard Snowberger, zoomed and cropped). -Sandra Pollard

09:31 -
Swimming right now just off the north end of the Navy base. Ironic that the whale watching boat is docked with passengers waiting to board. They just need to look across Jetty and they will see him.

07:28 - The grey whale
is off off
Jetty Island
again this morning. -Sandra Volkert-Honeycutt
