Entry 3:
Hood Canal into Port Gamble
when we sighted
two Orcas
to our right (facing Bridgehaven). At first we saw a fin rise up from the water and disappear and then another fin appear soon after. At first we did not believe our eyes until we saw them AGAIN! IT WAS AMAZING - against the evening sun. We could not take pictures or stopped because we were trying to make the 7pm/8pm Kingston to Edmonds ferry. This happened at
6PM
. Our state is so beautiful! -Trinh Nguyen
