ray whales #49 Patch and #383

Entry 6:
~

17:25 - I was at the Browns Point lighthouse
about an hour ago (
17:25). A couple sea lions had stuck their heads out near the beach. While watching for them to re-surface I saw something farther out, between BP and Pt Defiance. There were
6-8 of them
, with distinct Fins on their backs! I've seen enough sea lions to know they Don't have fins. The group turned towards Vashon/Maury and got too far for me to see. Any chance they were whales? -Cheri Carlson
(
No other whales reported, possibly Harbor porpoise - alb
)
