Orca Sightings for March 12, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Rosario Strait...out into
Rosario strait
where captain Tyler found us a group of
orca whales right off of Burrows island
. It turned out to be the
T90's
and we got some amazing looks at them as the were heading out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Encounter report/photos at Island Adventures

Entry 2:
17:21-

18:40 - T137 and her son T137A, T137B and her older brother T137A. T137s. T137A off Point No Point.
Following up - with pics from earlier post.
5:21 PM - heading out to run "
Point No Point
" beach. Couldn't believe it -
Transient Orcas
trolling right off the shore (30 to 40 meters out). Two big harbour seals were also in very close - 2 meters. Transient Orca pod then moved out - guessing 120 to 150 meters out - stayed there for 35 minutes diving (appeared to be feeding at times, unsure exactly, they'd all circle up at times - pod stayed in exact same spot - diving, every 45 seconds to 1.5 minutes- then appearing - avg sized orca / notch dorsal, 2 side by side oracs / always stayed close together / then massive male Orca, notch fin). After 35 to 40 min in same diving location (directly out from light house) they "slowly" trolled towards homes -
toward Hansville
grill. Then turned out into the abyss ... heading towards Whidbey Island!!! I pointed them out to many along beach - others also snapped pics & observed. Two big harbour seals stayed within 2 to 3 meters of water the entire time / they stayed along beach (2 meters of water) for over an hour. Possible the Transient pod had dinner earlier at 100 to 150 feet out - again they stayed in same location for 35 to 40 minutes - appeared to be feeding a few times. Unsure, best guess when they'd circle up/very close to each other. New at identifying orcas, feeding, etc. Second unreal experience off "Point No Point"!!!!! -Andrew Muehling

15:00 -
Last report from me...seeing entire family, now grouped together.
T137s
now well
south of Possession Point heading southwesterly
out from Picnic Point, still east of mid channel but moving further away from mainland. Slow steady pace.

14:50 -
I think they went on long dives...after losing them from sea level, I walked back up the ramp over the railroad tracks and with the assist of elevation spotted
T137A further west out from Picnic Point
and south of Possession Point heading slowly southwesterly. Ive not seen others yet.

14:13 - Orcas
surfing the wake of a tug that is passing northbound! And now milling around mid channel south end Possession Sound...After surfing can see T137A milling making many directional changes, not in any hurry.

14:05 - Orcas
are spread out:
T137A
is about mid channel milling back and forth, the other three spread in ones mid channel to east of mid while traveling slow/med pace southbound. I think T137D is closest to me.

13:55 -
I relocated to the beach at
Picnic Point Park, Lynnwood
... I can now see dorsal slicing through glassy calm water to the north (out from Shipwreck) heading my way, soon to disrupt some resting thermoregulating sea lions if they stay on course.

13:20 -
After regular surface intervals,
T137A
is on long dive, have not seen him, but just now caught glimpse of 2 of his family members dorsals to the south, more inshore towards Mukilteo than last sighting, both heading Southbound

13:11 - T137s
made fast time. I arrived
Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach
, alerted others on site and those about to leave...immediately we spotted the large dorsal of
T137A
traveling on his own further offshore east of mid channel, Clinton ferry terminal line of sight. His family had already passed, looking south soon after spotted someone else surface past south end of park (closer inshore than T137A) angling toward mid channel.

12:45 -

13:00 -
Arrived at
Harborview Park, Everett
in hopes to see the T137s, looking over the bluff short distance west could see dozens of gulls swooping in on glassy seas on what clearly was the location of the meal, but no orcas. I figured they must have flipped so I headed back west and on my way to Mukilteo as I was coming over the hill in the distance I spotted at least one of the
T137s just east of Mukilteo Ferry dock heading west at
13:00

Today we encountered them while they were northbound just
between Everett and Mukilteo. The T137's is a family of 4 consisting of T137 (36 yo) and her 3 kids, T137A (17yo), 137B (13yo) and T137D (7yo)
...When we arrived we could tell they were in pursuit of something. Was it a harbor seal or harbor porpoise? Not long into the predation event, we saw a seal head pop up amidst the chaos! This harbor seal wasn't going down without a fight and lasted quite a while before it all went silent. Depending on the size of their prey, how many are in the pod, and who is leading the hunt, it can take minutes to hours to take them down. Techniques need to be learned and skills perfected and today we got to see the learning process in action as the two youngest lead the charge with help from mom and big bro only when needed, They were distant for most of the encounter so max zoom and cropped where needed to show detail and/or the seal.

12:30 - It's the T137s, they are hunting a harbor seal, 2 miles east of Mukilteo ferry dock. T137A, T137 and youngest T137D

We had another double header today! With glass calm seas, we quickly found
3 Gray Whales between Hat/Gedney Island and the Snohomish River delta
. We were able to identify
#49 Patch and #53 Little Patch
but the third whale was a little too elusive to ID. Not far from the Gray Whales, we also encountered the
T137s
hunting a Harbor Seal just north of Mukilteo. The young bull
T137A
Jack gave the poor pinniped several slaps with his curled flukes. They seemed to finish the hunt and began feeding just as it was time for us to head back to the dock. Another great day on the water! -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

11:47 - 4 orcas at Mukilteo
, milling around and slowly working their way North towards Everett. -Photo by Tyler Graham, Mar 12, 2019

11:33 - Orcas just off Mukilteo ferry dock headed north 3-4 of them
...They were going to Everett definitely. Riding the shoreline. The bull popped up right next to the ferry. -Melissa Simmons, WSF

Just saw
3 orcas near North Beach (just north of Golden Gardens, North Seattle) heading north
. Looked like a male, a female, and a young one. -Amanda Salov

...
three gray whales around Gedney island
. They were fluking like crazy and showing their tales off on almost every dive. They turned out to be
531, 383, and 56
and it was amazing to see them feeding around the Possession sound...See full report/photos at Island Adventures Mar 12th Encounter blog post.
