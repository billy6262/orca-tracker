Not only do we have the bonus of an hour of extra light, but this evening brought the added bonus of orcas in Admiralty Inlet. At

6:20 pm orcas were seen off Lagoon Point, Whidbey Island, heading south.
With perfect sea conditions and a soft sheen on the water, along with Howard Garrett we watched a group of
at least six whales pass Bush Point at
6:57 pm
, exhilarating in surfing a freighter wake. The encounter was fast and brief as they porpoised at high speed, kicking up a spray before plunging into a dive and rapidly surfacing again. Our last sighting of them, in fading light, was as they passed the entrance to Hood Canal and Foulweather Bluff. What a lovely way to spend an evening! -Sandra Pollard

18:57 - Bigg's orcas in Admiralty Inlet passing Bush Point

Anna Singh'Deo called to report the
pod of orcas off Bush Pt. - at
6:55 pm
they had just passed the lighthouse. It looked like two bulls and 5 - 6 others, mid channel swimming south.

Kit Turner called from
Lagoon Point about
6:20
to say the Clipper had slowed and there were
orcas across Admiralty Inlet
. I got to Bush Pt. by
6:25 and scanned and scanned some more and didn't see anything until Sandra and Dick [Duck] showed up whereupon they appeared, way off on the Marrowstone Island shore bunched up nicely heading south. We saw at least four females and young followed by two males. A huge southbound container ship passed, prompting the whales to hitch a ride on the bow wake and surf at speed while porpoising at full race, like leaping gazelles. It sure looked like fun. -Howard Garrett

Wed Mar 13 - San Juans - After a series of phone calls from Jane Cogan relaying reports of a group of transients heading up San Juan Channel, Dave and Katie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little after 1500. We arrived on scene at about
1530 in Spieden Channel. The whales, already identified as the T90s and T101s, were traveling slowly west
near the southeastern shoreline of Spieden Island. T90C Spyhops. Photo by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, Mar 13, 2019. Full summary report/photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 15

Entry 3:
gray whale
last night (Wednesday 3/13/2019) at

7:49pm
. I was on the beach right by
Lover's Bluff on Lummi Island
(48.714009, -122.699765) when I heard three blows total over the course of about 1 minute. I started recording a video right after the first blow (attached). It was very close to shore....It seemed to be traveling North, and a few minutes later I heard it blow again seemingly near Village Point. I got in my car and headed to a beach a little North of there. At
8:15 I heard it blow again twice, and then about 2-3 minutes later I heard another blow, still traveling North. (I have an audio recording where you can hear at least one of the blows, it's not great quality though). I hope this is helpful, and please don't hesitate to let me know if I can provide any other information. Thank you for all of the work you do! -Very Best, Kelsey McLane

Entry 4:
grey was feeding off Polnell Shores

Entry 5:
Hat island
where captain Tyler found gray
whale #53 Little Patch
. We got some great flukes from him before heading to the shallows off of Hat island. Here we watched as #383 spy hopped multiple times, some of which were very high out of the water. -See full report/photos at Island Adventures

I just looked at the photos the CRC interns took on yesterday's (
March 13) whale watch trip and
531
has arrived. I hadn't seen any other confirmation of this yet so wanted to pass that on. It was sighted with
CRC383
....CRC531 was on the edge of the river delta when sighted on the 13th. -Alie PÃ©rez, Cascadia Research Collective
