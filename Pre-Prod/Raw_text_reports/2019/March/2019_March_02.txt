07:20 -
Good morning - I wanted to report seeing
3, possibly 4, orcas several 100 yards off Sandy Point Beach and heading north up Saratoga Passage.
Time was today, Saturday, 02-Mar-2019, at about 0720. Sorry no photos. I watched for 6-8 minutes, but the dog was more interested in the smells up along Wateredge Drive so had to move on....At least one was a male, I would guess, as the dorsal was visibly taller than the other two. A second might have been further across the channel (towards Camano Island), but I only glimpsed it once (thus the note regarding "3 or 4" in the group). -Jeff Rice

Entry 3:
The return of gray whale #49 -- Patch!
We had beautiful sunny skies as we left the dock for our 3-hour tour. It was an incredible day topped off with our first sighting of one of our all time favorite whales, Patch. Photos of Patch and blue skies to come soon! -Capt. Carl, Brittany, and Casey, Island Adventures

At least 2 orcas straight out from
North Beach (N Seattle neighborhood)
viewing area (just north of Golden Gardens). Lots of blows and are swimming around in the same area - can't tell which direction they are headed. One seems to be large male. Is a small sailboat nearby for reference. -Sir Winston

13:25 -
Yes! Just saw another spout, looks like
orcas are between mid-channel and Whidbey side
, can't tell exact location due to distance but down off SW side of Whidbey now...

13:20 -
I believe I just saw an orca spout and fin now closer to the Whidbey side, further south,
perhaps off the Double Bluff/Useless Bay
area, but visibility is fading and I only got one look and could not get another sighting to confirm.

13:05 - orcas are headed over toward the Kitsap side of the Inlet, toward Hansville and Point No Point.
