BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Sun Mar 10 - After an amazing display of coordinated hunting tactics, 6 yr old
T137D
applies the coup de gras to a harbor seal with support from mom T137 in the background and sibling
T137B in Lopez Pass
. Although it can be difficult to see at times, the calves must learn to hunt and T137 is a great teacher. -Photo by James Gresham, Mar 10, 2019

T137s were in Lopez Sound

Sounds like
#383
is back! Island Explorer 4 on scene with
5 whales SE off Hat Island. Welcome Gray whale 383!
. -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures
*
...Welcome back
#383!
We were thrilled to witness the return of another one of our Sounders today. It seemed we were not the only ones excited about 383's return, as every gray we've been seeing over the past couple of weeks was present in
Possession Sound
today, and quite social at that.
Little Patch (#53), Patch (#49), CRC-185, and CRC-2246 were all in attendance
....See full encounter report on Island Adventures

These two were all about each other for a minute today...New arrival,
"sounder" #383
approached kindasortagettingoldnewbie
PCFG #185
and put his head on top of 185's back. Always fun to watch their interactions! They are anything but mindless feeding machines. -Photo by Renee Beitzel, Mar 10, 2019

Entry 5:
5 Gray Whales on the SE side of Hat/Gedney Island
. We first arrived on scene with #49 Patch and then
#53 Little Patch
, though we could see other Gray Whales surfacing a bit further out. We found out that they were
#383, #185, and #2246! We even saw a sweet cuddle session between #383 and #185!
I didn't get photos of the bromance since I was inside the cabin when it happened, but it was sweet to see. -Justine Buckmaster
