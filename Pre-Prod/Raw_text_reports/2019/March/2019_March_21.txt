MARCH 21 - Thu Mar 21 - Good Morning, Yesterday (3/21) around

11:45 AM
I watched
two orca whales near the lighthouse at Fort Casey
. I attached some photos that I took of the two whales and despite the poor photo quality, I hope they can be of some use. Are you able to identify the whales from my photos? One of them appeared to be quite smaller than the other whale. Thank you! ...Thank you for the amazing response. Yes, I believe we were only watching the two you mentioned. However, it did appear that the Pt Townsend ferry was taking a different route than normal so maybe the others were closer to Port Townsend. Anyway, yesterday was my first time actually seeing the whales. I have spent hours chasing them based on posts from your awesome FB page. I will make sure and post when I see them again.
Just a bit about their behavior. They appeared to be diving and milling around in front of the lighthouse for about 20 or so minutes by the time was saw them. At on point, I captured the male swimming sort of erratic and his dorsal fin was laying sides ways. Maybe a catch? It was just a short time after that behavior that the two started moving at a faster rate toward the northwest. They made their way further from the coastline and
headed towards the Victoria/Lopez Island area

My wife and I were staying at The Inn at
Langley
on Thursday
March 21 and I got a few pics of
a gray whale right off of your deck
. When I showed Wendy at the Whale Museum and she said it could be #531 based on the look of the left pectoral fin that was above the water, and that I should send my best pics to you. Attached are the 2 best pics I took using my phone thru my binoculars...so I could get some really closeups. Hope you like them, and that you can use them for anything you need. -Regards, David Hartze, Everett, WA

. Just North of the south end of Camano....Just milling around mid channel. Looked like they were spending most the time just laying on the surface. Watched for about 15 minutes then left.

Port Susan and saw 5 or 6 small pods of porpoises
they were all over. -Dean Kayler
