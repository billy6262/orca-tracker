J-Pod
for end of the day (Sat. Mar. 23): after milling in
Haro
for much of the day, it sounds like they did all go
north into the Gulf Islands this evening
. -Monika Wieland Shields
*

16:33 -

J-Pod
!

13:51pm
- At the far north edge of
Hannah Hts, 3 orca following J27
appeared behind a crab catching sea lion. One of the trio was a youngster. It seemed like they were traveling in slow motion, reaching Edwards Point a full 15 minutes later. The sea was calm and silvery and they moved with such beautiful grace.

13:37pm -
1:47pm, J27 Blackberry
traveled ever so slowly N/NW along the far north edge of
Hannah Hts
approaching Edwards Point and continuing past. -Michelline Halliday, San Juan Island

I've got
J17 SB off LB
...Others spread far out and towards

here too..These 2 quarter mile off, haven't seen any others yet. J-Pod has been in Haro Strait yesterday and today, and this morning we were lucky enough to see J17 Princess Angeline from shore at Land Bank's Westside Preserve. At the end of last year J17 was showing "peanut head", a sign of undernourishment, and there were concerns about her making it through the winter, so it was especially heartwarming to see her! -Monika Wieland Shields.
