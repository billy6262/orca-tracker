My dad just told me he saw some
orcas heading south past Mukilteo
. Maybe two or three. Too far for pictures. He saw at least one breaching. He only saw them because he had been watching a vessel going north that changed track toward the orcas. When he saw the orcas there were three vessels trailing At a distance. Glacier Spirit, Saratoga, and Island Explorer. His house is up on the bluff with a view of the southern tip of Whidbey Island. -Jennifer W

Wed Mar 27 "...By
1730
, all of the groups had trickled back into the same area
outside of Thatcher Pass
. The T46s had arrived from the east and
T46D
had apparently re-joined the rest of the family at some point. The
T49As, T99B, and T99C arrived from the north first, then T36, T99, T99D, and T137A. The T36As and T36Bs brought up the rear
and all the whales slowly meandered west toward to the entrance to Thatcher Pass. The T49As then split from the other whales and headed into Thatcher Pass. When this happened, the rest of the whales turned around and headed south in Rosario Strait, hugging the James Island shoreline as they went. The encounter ended at 1805." -Full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 24.
