Entry 2:
T2Cs
! We got a quick look at this remarkable group of whales right outside Friday Harbor late this afternoon. All 5 of them were right together, including T2C2 Tumbo, who has scoliosis and is cared for by his family. The one-of-a-kind dorsal fin of
T19B Galiano
today in the southern Strait of Georgia.-Monika Wieland Shields

Not exactly sure how this works but wanted to let you know that we saw
four orcas heading south between the west coast of Orcas Island and Spieden Island
. This is a picture of three of them and then a fourth (I think) came cruising by about five minutes later. This was taken about
2:30pm on
March 16th. T2Cs southbound heading towards San Juan Channel. Gorgeous!!! -John Felton

Hello All, Just wanted to thank Carl, Erin and Nomi for an amazing day yesterday. We all got a little nervous about seeing any Orca as the day went on however Captain Carl and the incredible network with other captains out there saved the day. We went up to Canadian waters where we were able to see Vancouver and had one of the best shows I can remember. The total count was difficult to be sure of however double digits for sure, including a few big males and some younger ones. They were the T's and early thoughts on some are
T49A1, T49 Family (verified as T49As - alb), Brothers -T19B, T19C, etc.
Please verify. I attached a picture of my Google Maps of the area we saw them (~1 mile N of Tumbo Island, BC). All around 2-
3:30pm. Enjoy the pictures and once again, great time out there! T49As (T49A3 in forefront)...T91B and T19, T19C and T19B. -David Haeckel

John Agen called to report a probable
gray whale in north Skagit Bay
, about 6-7 miles SE of Deception Pass, 50-60 yds off a reef in shallow water, heading SE toward the Swinomish Channel.

Entry 5:
3 Gray Whales
. We spotted
#49 Patch
first and had a fleeting close look as he cruised past us SE of Hat/Gedney Island. A bit further E we found
#53 Little Patch
socializing with
#383
with a beautiful view of Mt. Baker in the background. On our way home we stopped to see some Steller Sea Lions and Brandt's Cormorants hanging out on the Scatchet Head buoy. -Justine Buckmaster

Saturday,
March 16: Perfect day for a boat trip with glassy seas, blue skies and crystal clear mountains - and whales. After leaving Langley Marina we headed south where
Saratoga grays #49 (Patch), #53 (Little Patch) and #383
were feeding
between Hat Island and the Delta around noon
. One of the whales decided to check us out before making a directional change towards the shoreline of Hat Island. Although there were other boats around, engines were cut and distance requirements well maintained, making for a peaceful encounter broken only by the whales' powerful exhalations as they surfaced.
