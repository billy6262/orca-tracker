16:00-

Thanks...there was so much tail slapping going on...training the young ones maybe? It was around 4-
5:30 in the evening. The whales were doing what
Transients
do so well...diving and coming up where ever they wanted...the kayaks were along the edge of the boats but trying to stay out of their way too..I did speak to the kid in the kayak..the sheriff did give him a warning and he had no idea about the amount to stay away..He loves orca's and have seen kayaks with them alot on you tube..so he knew they would not harm him...he didn't paddle into them that I saw..they whales were in two groups and kept meeting up together so it was gonna happen sooner or later. Really hard to move kayaks fast to get out of the way....Noelle Morris

17:19 - Orca.
LOTS of activity! Lots of breaches! Many directional changes. In the middle of the bay heading towards
Tracyton
area and away from Chico side. But again, lots of directional changes! You should be able to see them (with binoculars) now at the Silverdale Waterfront Park.

17:12 - Orca
. a substantial number of dorsal fins observed - really, really far away, but heading northeast - towards old town
Silverdale
, but still really far away. Binoculars required. Near Chico Bay pilings..(?)

17:04 - Orcas at Chico Bay
continuing north on the Chico side of Dyes Inlet - observed with binoculars from Old Town Silverdale. A white boat with a lime green canopy (?) is traveling with them (assume they are following the rules). Again, a substantial distance away. -Diane Russell
*
This is a video from the Orca visit in Dyes Inlet on Wednesday 6/26/19. We were in our boat and kept our distance. I zoomed in and that is partly why it is such a shaky video. The Kitsap County Sheriff were out making sure boaters and kayakers were following the rules. What an amazing experience. I wanted to share with those who didn't get to experience this! -Orca Video by Kimberly Marzano Very active

4 - 5 orcas off Jefferson Head

(Time & location would mean separation of groups before entering
Rich Passage
and group joined up later, or different unknown group all together, or time was incorrect -alb)

T046B family
somewhere near

*

Entry 9:
gray whale was feeding Steamboat Flats (The shallows of the Snohomish River delta)
at high tide today. We have had a solo small whale intermittently since the Sounders left. I assume it is the same individual each time. I was unable to get a good picture, but I attached one that shows some markings on the left dorsal..I live on the Tulalip reservation overlooking the shallows of the Snohomish River just beyond Jetty Island, I just recently consulted the Coast Guard Light List to find the official name of the navigational marker at the outer edge of the delta. It is called "Steamboat Flats Light". For years, we just referred to it as :the dolphin. That is the region we have been seeing the whale. Curt Johnson

2 whales across from Mabanna
headed towards Irenella closer to Whidbey than us. -Linda Brezak
