Orca Sightings for June 1, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
the little white whale, little pale-white whale T46B1B and family
on our Outer Islands Excursions trip last Saturday....We were off the
east side of Vancouver Island sometime between
5:00 and
5:30 pm
on Saturday
June 1. The pod was headed north and we had followed them for a while. A BC ferry going at a fast clip passed over where we expected the pod to surface next, but the pod evidently moved west of the ferry's position and surfaced right in our path, coming straight at us. -Joy Kane

Entry 2:
T046B's
spent almost hardly moved for 24 hours and hung out around the mouth of
Saanich Inlet
. Tas and I went out this morning and hung out with the very energetic matriline. Lots of surface active behaviours, playing with prawn trap floats and surface vocals! Here is T046B3 taking to the sky.

Entry 3:

3 Transient Orcas in Satellite Channel/Sannich Inlet

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Sat Jun 1 - Hello, I live on Gabriola Island at the northwest end of Pylades Channel, just before False Narrows (a narrow channel between Gabriola and Mudge Island). Last night (
June 1st)
between
7:00 and
7:30 I saw at least three orcas, possibly four, heading west through False Narrows
towards Nanaimo. One had a large dorsal fin so was probably a male.This is the second time I have seen orcas transiting False Narrows at high tide, although they have been seen by others going through on numerous occasions. For the whales! -Margaret Davison

Any way of knowing what pods are near Depoe Bay Oregon? We just saw
4 or 5 northbound from Depoe Bay
. I have video but no way to edit or upload it. -Jim Clark

Entry 5:
4:00 north of Kayak Point in Port Susan
. Big counterclockwise Loop and about 20 minutes feeding in the shallows. We were at least 100 yards and in 15-20 feet so it was in very shallow water. -Steve DeKoekkoek

19:40 -
Around
7:40 this evening Eilene & I were just south of Salty's when we were startled by a loud sound and looked up to see a whale surfacing close to shore. We believe this was
a gray whale
. It moved off to the north along the Harbor Ave shoreline. We drove to Duwamish Head, where along with others, we watched it surface a number of times before the whale headed southwest
toward Alki Point about
8:00 PM
. -David & Eilene Hutchinson

11:34 - gray
is hangin off
Rockaway beach
heading south. Looks to be a young one, smallish.

11:21 - gray
has exited the harbor. No direction noted (it did go way west into the harbor, slowly exited east and stayed for probably 15-20 minutes off Pritchard beach, very close to beach. People on the beach took photos. Then went north to middle of entrance to harbor, then out.)

11:14 - gray
is now more north in ferry path...ferry coming in super slow.

11:04 - gray
is in the little beach area by
Cresosote
.

11:02 - gray
just passed the end of our dock, appears healthy, is heading out of harbor going east.

10:37 -
We just had call,
gray whale in way in Eagle Harbor
low tide, highly unusual and weird. John jumping in dinghy to check it out....nothing ever comes in this harbor. -Lorrain Doer

Entry 8:
Gray 2256
in that area at this time)
~

18:30 -
when we saw what looked like a juvenile gray whale...feeding about 200 yards east of the
Jack Block Park Overlook in Seattle
- near the
mouth of the Duwamish River
. Did multiple loops of the same basic area...Don't remember the exact time, mid to late afternoon...No images, we stayed for about 45 minutes. Seemed like the whale was doing a feeding loop on what might be that last section of a muddy, mostly undisturbed, bottom near the mouth of the Duwamish. It was still doing loops when we left. -Steve Colony & Dreana Eden
