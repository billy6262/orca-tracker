Hi, Standing at water's edge today about
2:20 p.m., we had
four Orca whales
near shore in front of my house. This shoreland in
East Sound
is about 1 or 2 miles just before the Village of Eastsound. This was very surprising as they never come here. After they left, a seal popped up...guess he escaped a fate today. Four photos attached. -All the best, Ann DeKay, Bronson Way, Eastsound, WA
