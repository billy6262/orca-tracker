Orca Sightings for June 10, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:30 pm
today, a group of
4 orca went slowly westward through Active Pass
. Photos taken from the shore of Galiano Island. I have been told they are the T123s. Please confirm. -Karoline Cullen
(
T123s
confirmed by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research
)

Entry 2:
Transient Killer Whales south of Sooke! The T073a's & T075's
(Id Mark Malleson) were traveling inbound in the Juan De Fuca Strait. -Paul Pudwell
*

Entry 3:
approximately
8:30 a.m.
, a couple hundred yards
offshore of "Devil's Punchbowl" at Otter Rock, Oregon
. Photos attached (I shot some pretty good video, too, but will need to edit and upload that before it's possible to share it). It was difficult to get a definitive count because they were so active (and I had my eyeball embedded in camera viewfinder), but there were
at least 4 animals
in the pod; the largest male breached completely out of the water at one point. They had caught a harbor seal in open water and were batting it around (I couldn't tell if they ultimately killed it, but a dozen of so gulls were swooping in close as if to scoop up pieces of something?). After 10 minutes or so with the seal, they resumed moving north again, headed toward Depoe Bay. -Howard Shippey, South Beach, OR

09:30 - At least 2 Gray whales off Cliffside beach at NAS Whidbey
. Looks like now heading NE. They stopped for a while to feed. Saw several pectoral fin displays. -Kris Holley
*

Entry 6:
Port Susan - Shackleton
is still here. The first shot was taken last week, the second, today at about

8:45AM
. Almost always moves north past Kayak Point, then into the intertidal zone to feed, moving towards Warm Beach. Today he seems to be moving more slowly and not feeding as aggressively as normal. Is he the only sounder still around? Hope he's OK. -Gary Lingenfelter
*

Entry 7:
2 grays heading north thru Colvos Pass, Gig Harbor side
. Can't confirm the second (as gray) as it was to far away, but it was weird because they were acting funny coming right up to the boat while we where fishing and it literally went all the way into the beach as in it was almost all the way up to the shore line under 10 ft of water. But as they both headed north up thru Colvos they where both tracking north together only maybe 20 yards or so apart. -Janssen Olson
(
video confirms
at least one of the whales was a gray
- see frame grab below - alb

Entry 8:
Possession Sound -

10:40 -
My husband, Don Fernandez, caught this video at
10:40a southeast of Hat heading east. Sadly he hit stop recording just before tail fluke and a dive! Looks like
a gray
. -Lori Christopher
(yes did look like a gray, barnacled head etc -alb)

two minkes south of Cattle Point
. -Pete Ancich

14:45 -
From what I can see through binoculars from
Cattle Point Lighthouse it looks like there's at least one minke a mile or two south
from the lighthouse with whale watching boats around. -Alex McIntire
