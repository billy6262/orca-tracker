Entry 5:
Constance Bank
, we were in the company of
at least 2, maybe 3 humpback whales
. First, we witnessed a rambunctious calf who seemed to be more interested in playtime than anything else and even took to the air in a breach, more than once! Shortly after, mom went on a few dives, and thanks to a quick glimpse of the fluke, and the help of Tasli, another naturalist in the area, we were able to confirm this whale as
MMZ0004 Zephyr
. We could see a lot of white from the pectoral flippers underwater as they slowly swam past the boat. A quick look through a few photos showed that there was, in fact, another whale with this cow/calf pair, only, who was it? After mom and calf went on a bit of a deeper dive, so did whale number 3 and we then had ID confirmation. It was a well known and beloved whale named
"Two Spot (CS631aka CRC16017)
"!!...Renee

Anacortes: Our search took us up to
Boundary Pass
where we found two humpback whales! It was double trouble with
Stitch (MMX0167) and Divot (BCX1057)
. They were showing off their powerful flukes with each deep dive...Sam, Port Angeles & Anacortes excerpted from Island Adventures
