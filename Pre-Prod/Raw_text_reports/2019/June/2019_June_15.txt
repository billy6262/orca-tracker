Sat Jun 15 - Juan de Fuca Strait...bait ball with lots of bird activity right out of the harbor when the captain spotted a blow
not far out of Port Angeles
. Unfortunately a large cargo ship was dropping off a pilot and the humpback whale did a disappearing act on us never to be seen again. We continued on
northeast
towards the rockpile, an area know for abundant life and sure enough we encountered another
humpback whale
or perhaps the same one. She turned put to be none other than
BCY0324 Big Mama
and we watched her for quite awhile as she feed making huge circles all around us. Island Adventures,
June 15 reports and images HERE.

a lunge feeding humpack whale
in shallow waters close to shore feeding on bait fish....Sweet! This is
