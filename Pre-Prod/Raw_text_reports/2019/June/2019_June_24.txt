There's a
gray whale off Madrona Ave in Everett
near where the one recently died. Really close to shore. I hope he/she stays healthy. It had a gash on its tail possibly from a prop...The gash was a straight line, maybe a foot long & 2 inches wide approximately...It seemed quite active & was heading north east along the shoreline (towards Everett). It has a lot of barnacles on it...Connie Mitchell

Donna w/WS Ferries Ops called to report a
whale, possibly gray, heading northbound off Mukilteo

Single whale seen off
Possession Point
(south Whidbey) this morning about 30 minutes ago, heading south. Unsure if humpback or grey. Didn't get a good shot unfortunately...Unfortunately my family didn't wake me so I didn't get to see it myself.
Looks like a grey
head to me. -Stephanie J Deckard
