Sun Jun 23 - Haro Strait - Conditions were especially challenging today, but that didn't stop us or the whales! We encountered
Transient Killer Whales near Eagle Point
in some turbulent waters. We were able to identify the
T46Bs and T77A
and I got to meet the little gray calf who's been the talk of the town for the first time! I didn't get great photos, but I got photos. Overall, today's trip on the Saratoga was quite the adventure.
