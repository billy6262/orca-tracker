Entry 4:
humpback
breaching and pec slapping in
Port Susan
! "that is a humpback in Port Susan! In the beginning of your video looks like a couple of breaches, then s/he is pec slapping, you can see long pec fins, which is what confirmed humpback. Watching again, might just be all pec slapping. Also noticed underside of her/his fluke is all white so is POSSIBLE this is the
humpback known as CS631 or CRC16017 "Two Spot". "
