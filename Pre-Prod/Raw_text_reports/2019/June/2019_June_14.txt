15:45 - Orcas in Possession Sound 3/4 mile south of Hat Island
halfway between Whidbey and Everett. Very close to small motor boat that is not moving. Three, including one male; too far away for further ID; very active, possibly feeding? Lucky boaters....They moved slowly from Whidbey side, and then stayed where I reported for at least 20 minutes being very active. We had to leave home to head for the event in Coupeville. They were still there when we left. -Sue Ellen White.
