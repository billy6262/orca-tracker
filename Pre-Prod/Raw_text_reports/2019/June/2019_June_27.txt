15:45 -

16:05 -
As Gayle and I drove along the shore we caught glimpses of the pod porpoising at high speed on approach to
Manette Bridge
. We stoppped at East 9th Street Mini park where we had a great view as they porpoised under the Manette bridge surfacing on the east side ~
15:54. The Ts continued porpoising east bound with one member turning back going opposite direction momentarily...for a minute looked like maybe they were after a meal, but not so as they continued on directionally ENE. We made it over to Bachman Park in time to watch them surface to the west of us, off Point Herron. Next dive was a bit long, they surface a bit NE of us all at Bachman. Once around Point Herron they slowed their pace, grouped very tight, cuddle puddle like, with some rolling and tail lobs (some inverted) and continued to the north in Sinclair Inlet. We left around

16:05-10, headed over to Ilahee State Park to see which passage they would take, Rich or Port Orchard... Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

13:33 -
Gayle Swigart and I arrived at the
Tracyton Boat Launch
~
13:30 just in time to see the orcas traveling southbound at the north end of Washington Narrows, south of Tracyton Boat launch. So incredibly close and beautiful since such a narrow passage. Watched the whales grouped, traveling steady southbound for a few minutes before they disappeared around the bend. We then were off with a carvan of others south to try and see them from Lions Park (knowing very well they may flip back as they've been doing while in Dyes since yesterday). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

Lovely day on 6/27, catching up with my favorite family of Ts, the
T65As
..."Artemis" and her five kids. We came on scene at
Sucia Island
. While they weren't super active, it was lovely to spend time with them! -Bonnie Gretz
*

09:30 - Three orcas off West Beach Resort, Orcas Island
, heading north. We observed from a distance at land, looked like one orca had a very large fin and one appeared to be a juvenile. Since they were observed from such a distance, it's difficult to be accurate. There was a boat following them from a respectable distance. -Xtina Georges

Thanks Carrie!
Via Alisa Schulman-Janiger: Melisa Pinnow (Center for Whale Research) has confirmed the IDs on these whales as
Bigg's transients: the T49As and the T49Bs

My Son Elah was fishing lingcod off the south jetty this morning. No fish but he saw a pod of about
4 Orcas
checking into our bay! -Sincerely, Michael Banks
