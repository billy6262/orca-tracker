Orca Sightings for September 30, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Wrapping up September with this update by Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute: September is in the books, which means it's time for another check-in on killer whale visits to the Salish Sea. This month saw an end to the incredible run of 126 consecutive days with Bigg's killer whales (transients) present somewhere in the region.
September 12 was the first day since May with no Ts detected/reported. This was also the highest month to date for Southern Resident presence in the region in 2019, continuing a multi-year trend of September being the "best" month. Interestingly, however, the whales spent considerable time both in Puget Sound and up in the northern Strait of Georgia, areas they typically tend to visit in the later autumn and winter.

Mon Sep 30 - Haro Strait - On Saturday evening, 28 September, we received a report that J,K, and some L whales were off Campbell River in the Strait of Georgia; and, they had apparently been up in the Strait of Georgia for about a week since we last saw them 21 September heading north in Haro Strait. At
1100
today, 30 September, they were reported heading west in Boundary Pass off East Point, Saturna Island, and shortly later
at 1226 they were off Battleship Island
, Haro Strait. Ken saw the first whales heading south off the Center for Whale Research at 1321 and by 1415 they had mostly passed by very spread out across the Strait. At 1615, Ken departed Snug Harbor in "Chimo" to encounter and check on the status of the new baby, J56. As luck would have it, the first photo that he took was of J56 with mom (J31) several miles offshore of False Bay...Full summary and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 80

13:48 -

15:45 - Haro Strait
. Observed from shore
between Edwards Point and Hannah Hts
. A careful count of
29 +/- individuals including 11+/- males
. I heard the first blows before I saw them. 2 orca passing Edwards Point traveling to the south; followed by 2 more, and they kept coming. Most were spread out but there were two groups traveling tight, a group of 6 with a calf and later a group of 9 in very tight formation. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

12:30 Southern Residents
coming down
Haro Strait from north of Henry Island
- could be members of all three pods if it's everyone who has been up north in the Strait of Georgia! Today
J-Pod, the K13s, and 18 members of L-Pod made their way south into Haro Strait
after spending several days up in the northern Strait of Georgia. Incredibly, this was our first official research encounter this year that included members of L-Pod other than L87! At
46 whales
, this is also the largest single group of Southern Residents we've had together in inland waters since January.

Entry 5:
two large whales going completely airborne
, South of Whidbey half way to Edmonds, in the shipping lanes, they were to large for Orca, Very tall spouts, This went on for 15 minutes, one would spy hop and the other would go airborne at a 45 degree angle high enough I could see air under its tail. Was to far away to get a picture, I am positive they were
Humpbacks
