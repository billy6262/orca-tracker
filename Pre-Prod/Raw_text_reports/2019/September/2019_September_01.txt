Sun
September 1, 2019 - We had whales all over the place, but all heading away from us! It wasn't easy choosing a route, but in the end it worked out just fine. Crossing the border into Canada
south of D'arcy Island we encountered the T18's
who were met by the
T46B's and the T100's
. Included in this group is the young calf,
T46B1B aka "Tl'uk"
- a rare pale gray/white orca...(See full blog post with images HERE). -Barbara & David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Entry 2:
T36s and T36Bs, T36A1 Tierna (total 9)
, first found on the
backside of Orcas Island
, where they made a kill. As they moved east, they moved into the beautiful sparkly backlit light....we reluctantly left them, but on the way home, at sunset, found them again at Lummi Island! What a treat to see sunset whales with good friends David and Meliss Haeckel. 9/1/19. -Bonnie Gretz

T036 and T036A's
