Weather and visibility is horrendous & just got worse. However
A lot of orcas spread across at least from Richmond Beach to mid channel southbound
. At least 3 males more mid, with some females and young. Also several spread on east side of channel in 1-3s. Seas too rough to positively ID but behaviorally look like Southern Residents. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

08:09 -
Andrew Muehling reports: He was on
Kingston Ferry heading to Edmonds
. Mid channel.
Pod of 4+ orcas
one side of ferry and orca on other side. Guessing Southern via spread out. Heading towards Kingston! I saw all females. Not 100% - but one might have been a calf/baby- next to mom. Again not sure fairly far away, just briefly popped up. Others on ferry said they saw many - Reason i think Southern. Unsure though. Last time i saw southern they were spread out / fishing for salmon. Transients i've seen generally more tightly together. What a treat. Water was choppy / didn't see any saddles, unfortunately.
