Orca Sightings for September 7, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
13:02 - Yes that is T102
(Tiberghien photo below). They
(T101s) are in Presidents Channel now with T36As and T49A3, 9 total.

07:45 -
A big group of orcas showed up this morning off Edith Point, close to shore but outside the reef.
Matriarch T101, T102 - early morning off Mayne Island.
Unusually big group like residents, clustered in 3 subgroups or lines with 2-3 each. They were relaxed. Seals were not scared this time (so, seals know the difference between residents and ?). Many remained asleep half in the water and the 2 looking out were not jerking upright as they do for transients. Since it was early around 745am, there was no boat around- all peaceful, unannounced. Their breath echoes loudly in the Strait. Magnificent. -Cheers, Yves Tiberghien, (Mayne island, Edith point)

Entry 2:
two orcas, Matriarch T137 and T137B were sighted right near the dock of YMCA Camp Orkila on Orcas Island
(approx 48.700097, -122.945785. on Saturday 9/7/19 at
4:17pm. "The whole camp was in awe of how close these were, and came running to revel in the beauty." -Jeff Ahrenholz

Updates
T137A's injury
: Thoughts from Stephanie Norman on
T137A upon review of photos by Sara Hysong-Shimazu images (2 shared below):
Saw Sarah's photos. Definitely a humdinger of a wound. He will have scarring, maybe significant scarring. It's hard to determine what the long dangling piece of tissue is (tendon, ligament, muscle, or subcutaneous fat). ...Different view, but same comments as I wrote with the last picture. Definitely something got him, but good that he is able to raise flukes this high. Indicating he has good range of motion in that direction and he is able to overcome or deal with any pain still present in the wound. Will be interesting to keep documenting the progression of wound healing (hopefully contracts down to a smaller size)! Thanks for sending this photo along! -Stephanie A. Norman, DVM, MS, PhD

T137A - San Juans

Entry 4:
T137A in the San Juans
- warning, these are a bit gross - I must admit I was a bit surprised at the extent of tissue discharge at the wound site, but the good news is that he seemed to be swimming and diving much more normally than when Candi and I saw him last week (no head throw upon surfacing and not sinking on the terminal dive) - he is clearly aware of this tissue touching his skin as he had repeated bouts of tail slaps and rubbed on a crab pot line and kelp - apparently trying to dislodge it. Although separate from the rest group initially he did close the gap and while lagging behind a bit he seemed to be able to keep pace toward the end of the encounter - the other whales were clearly foraging on a couple of occasions and although he didnt appear to participate he was in close proximity. I have sent these to several vets for their assessment, however, given the interest in his condition I am forwarding these photos for you to post now if you want. While it looks gross I would caution readers from jumping to conclusions until the vets can weigh in. Thanks, Brad Hanson, NOAA/NWFSC
AND this initial assessment below is edited version of a compilation of comments Brad received from Drs. Hendrik Nollens, Stephen Raverty, and Marty Haulena: The white is fibrin, which is the equivalent of a scab trying to form. This "scab" remains flexible and forms strings or sheets as it oozes out of the wound. This is presumably an adaption to being aquatic and it is benign.
It was nice to see all the margins of the wound. We now have confirmation that it does not extend around the central peduncle. We can see it actually does not penetrate deep enough to damage the fluke tendons or compromise the main blood supply to the fluke. The fluke tips are still intact. You would have seen some sloughing of the fluke tips by now, had blood supply been compromised.
The bulging of the reddish host tissues is in part due to swelling, fibrin production, inflammatory exudate and presumably local wound response. It too is a normal part of wound healing. There is rich bed of granulation tissue (in some areas exuberant), and that bodes well for wound healing response.
These photos indicate an improvement in wound condition over those on the recent Facebook post. If he continues to eat and therefore hydrate, this wound may get enough time to heal. There is a chance of wound bacteria spreading and causing complication including death, but the wound is open so it is continuously being flushed, which is great.
Given enough time and without wound complications, I would expect the wound to turn entirely white. The "red" will turn white as well. The host tissues will shrink back down and less tissues will appear to protrude. The defect will probably never completely fill in, but I would expect the black skin to grow back in eventually.

Sat Sep 7 - San Juans - ...It was not long into the trip before we had whales. Just as we rounded the
northern tip of Guemes
, dorsal fins were in sight, dramatically cutting through the water. It was the
T46s, a group of five Bigg's orcas, Wake (T46) in the lead
. We cruised with them as they worked the current lines and shallows around Sinclair Island and Viti Rocks.
Strider (T46D)
, broke away from the pod to come say hi, as he is known to do....Island Adventures
