Kimberly Sylvester and I watched
at least 20 orcas pass by Rolling Bay
overlook the last half hour. Spread out from here to Fay Bainbridge. Members of
J11's, including J56

J27
, foraging nearby, rolled over and swam on his back awhile with pec waves and tail slaps. As of

, seen from Lowman Beach Park. -Kayli Ann Breitweiser

Rainy day on Chilkat out of Pt. Townsend. First we found
Humpback Two Spot (MMZ0013) of Marrowstone Point
, then headed south to catch up with reported Residents. We found some
Js and Ks around Shilshole/Bainbridge
. It was really raining so the picture conditions were not good! Definitely i.d.'d
J26 (Mike) and J47(Notch), and possibly K20 (Spock)
(
confirmed - alb
). They were super active, breaching, tail slapping, one male did a HUGE cartwheel, spyhopping, rolling over....lovely to see despite the weather! Thanks, Puget Sound Express!!! I've never been this far south on the water before.
K20 Spock, K38 Comet, J37 Hy'Shqa, J22 Oreo, J38 Cookie
.

12:21 -
Just leaving orcas around
Shilshole Bay
, super active, but spread out. ...Very wet conditions. At least
J26, J47 and maybe K20

11:56 - Orcas
. There's a group southbound now, due
west of Discovery Pt
. They're far. Lots of breaches!

11:39 - Orcas
. Seeing them really distantly from
Discovery Pt (West Point, Discovery Park)
for the past 30 mins, looking NW, towards the N end of Bainbridge. West side of Sound...I saw a group mid-channel but they moved towards the west side.
Slowly southbound
. -Sophie Mazowita
*

11:55 - Orcas
. Update: heading out as the weather is making them harder to track. Looks like they are still trending south mid channel. And here's a crappy picture.

11:24 - Orcas
. Watching from Sunset Hill (
Ballard
). They are across from Shilshole, mid channel, looks like 6-8 and at least two males trending south. Really spread out. -Danielle Carter

11:15 -
Bonnie Gretz called, seeing at least on big male orca off
Point Jefferson
, southbound.
(
Probably trailer indicating whales are spread - alb
)
*

10:30 - Orcas (members of J pod at least)
are southbound mid channel in the Sound between mid
Port Madison, Kitsap and Carkeek Park, Seattle
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

09:20 - Half a dozen orcas southbound between Apple Cove Point and Kingston
. Most near the shipping lanes, but a couple closer to Edmonds. One male breached a few times mid channel. They were only going SB during the 5 minutes I was watching them. I haven't seen them since. -Sherman Page
*

08:50 -
Donna with WS Ferries Ops called to report
orcas heading northbound in the northern end of Edmonds/Kingston ferry
traffic lanes.

Entry 3:
16:55 -
These guys had already passed directly in front of our home and were due north of Green Point (
between Sequim and PA
) when I saw them surface at
4:55 pm. Not that great of photos (it would have been much better directly out from the house) but I send this off to you as there appears to be a young orca in the group of three that were traveling eastbound. -Tony Little, East Bluff Drive, Port Angeles, WA

T37As

Entry 5:
Humpback Two Spot(MMZ0013) of Marrowstone Point
, then headed south to catch up with reported Residents....Bonnie Gretz
*

Entry 6:
18:00 - Saw one orca
, waiting to see if there are others 1800
off Edmonds/Mukilteo
. Don't see any others so far. Only saw the tip of the dorsal but looked big enough to be a male I think. (asked if possibly humpback?): no I don't think so, the dorsal fin was on its way under water, I saw about half of it, but I feel like it was much too large, which is why I thought it was a male. I watched it for a minute or so and the tail slap and underside of the fluke looked like an orca, but I can't say I'm 100 percent sure....so I just looked at pictures of whale vs orca flukes and now I'm confused. It definitely could have been a whale (humpback)..Alice Thuy Talbot
