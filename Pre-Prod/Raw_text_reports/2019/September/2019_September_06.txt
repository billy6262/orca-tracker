Orca Sightings for September 6, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca - (Ks and at least L54s)
- A fun foggy & nautical day around Sooke! Heading out west in the hope of humpback whales our visibility was down to a few hundred feet at best and by surprise we came across some killer whales west bound past Sheringham Lighthouse we took a few quick pictures and after a few minutes we figured our that they were the
Endangered Southern Residents (some L Pod (L54) & ?)
we alerted the other operators and departed slowly...the fog did lift for about 5 minutes and we could see many others way out in the distance...The fog came back quickly but we were lucky to come across
around 8 Humpbacks
a few miles east as the skies cleared we had a chance to get some more pictures. You never know, and please understand we do not search out or promote the viewing of SRKW and as soon as we knew who we had we departed immediately...our guests understood and were very pleased with our Humpback encounters.
Matriarch L54 Ino (b. 1977) - L54 Ino, K36 Yoda (b. 2003), & others...L54 Ino, K36, Yoda, & K22 Sekiu (b. 1987) - K Pod mates, born a year apart: K43 Saturna (b. 2010) and K44 Ripple (b. 2011).

Fri Sep 6 - Puget Sound - Scott Veirs and I walked back on the now eastbound ferry to return to Edmonds and quickly spotted
blows off Apple Tree Point
. We were presuming it was same whale until I found reports from earlier of multiple whales so not sure who it was. Upon departing the boat, Scott asked Paul more questions about the
earlier humpback (I've ID'd as Two Spot)
where we learned WSF crew had been seeing the whale (s) since ~

We walked on the

11:55 ferry
Puyallup from Edmonds to Kingston to test some sightings apps. Before departing the dock WSF crew member Paul informed us they had seen
a humpback from the 11am
ferry out of
Kingston
who was slapping his tail within easy viewing distance from the boat coming over. Sure enough on our westbound sailing the captain announced the presence of the
humpback
on our starboard side
~
12:10
. We moved to outside starboard deck to see
tail lobbing humpback in traffic lanes closer to Kitsap side
(out from Apple Tree Point) heading eastbound.
Tail-lobbing "Two Spot" the humpback.
To catch a better view moved to the upper deck to watch the humpback continue his tail lobbing/surface sequences as we passed by. He continued in eastbound direction as we pulled into Kingston. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network & Scott Veirs, Orca Sound
