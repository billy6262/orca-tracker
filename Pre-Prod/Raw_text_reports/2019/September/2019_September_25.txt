Orca Sightings for September 25, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ks & Ls
- We were working in CWR's Photo-ID office when we heard about whales on the
west side of San Juan Island
. Since the whales were heading north, we decided to see if we could see them from shore first. We headed down to
LandBank
on the west side by about 1030 where we saw members of K pod plus L54 heading slowly north very spread out...Encounter summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 78.
