Entry 2:
18:00 - Wow!!!! We live on the water off
Portage Bay near Indian Island
. I have for the first time ever just seen
4 Orcas traveling through towards Port Townsend
!!! Not sure if these were Transient or Resident but regardless..... this is a first through the Portage Canal that links Oak Bay and Hadlock Bay! ...it was about 6pm when I saw the Orcas! Still have goosebumps! I have never seen or heard of Orcas going through this way but always hoped one day they would! I'll email a couple more photos and keep my camera close by Incase they decide to stroll by again! For sure one was a baby, the others not so sure? Thank you for what you do! Our home is at xx Laurel street in Port Hadlock, they were right in our backyard! -Cindy Krievins-Daccurso

Thu Sep 26 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Good morning, Traveling on the American Spirit from Port Angeles to Port Townsend, we saw
a small pod of Orcas just north of the New Dungeness lighthouse
. Where can I go to identify which pod these were from. From what I could see, there were three traveling close to each other and one a further distance away. It was an incredible experience! They were
headed east
