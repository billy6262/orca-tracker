Entry 1:
Sun Sep 15 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Thank you nature! The rain held off and with calm seas we had the pleasure to share so many whales off
Sooke
today that we were all smiles! First with
humpback whales almost everywhere we went with around 20
in the area and then
Transient / Biggs Killer Whales
minutes from our docks. Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell
