Orca Sightings for September 10, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juans...At Iceberg Point
, eagle-eyed Casey found
a humpback whale
from the galley. We got a couple of looks at this individual before continuing onward. We'd heard of reports of a larger group of whales further on that we wanted to catch up to, but would have to cover some water before getting there. We caught a glimpse of a minke whale along the way, spotted at Salmon Bank by an eagle-eyed passenger. It was just north of Portland Island that we met up with the early report of whales we were hoping to reach. It was a pod of
four Bigg's Killer Whales, the T18s!

Tue Sept 10 - San Juans - At
Iceberg Point
, eagle-eyed Casey found
a humpback whale
from the galley. We got a couple of looks at this individual before continuing onward....We
left the pod near Active Pass
, and continued south through Navy Channel and onwards towards Spieden. Just
east of Spieden we met up with MMX007, "Bond" the humpback whale
. This individual was swimming circles, making its surfacing more difficult to predict. So, we just sat and drifted as it surfaced in every direction around the boat. -Island Adventures (Link to the day's full report in Bigg's section)

Sept 10 - Eastern Juan de Fuca Strait - This was called in Tuesday eve. at
6:22, by Roger Nichols, relaying a report from the observer, Doug Huttle.
Between 4 and 5 pm, for half an hour, he observed what looked like a small gray whale
, "in distress" about 300 feet out from the
Lighthouse at Ft. Casey
. The whale was swimming in circles, diving, repeating for a half hour.
(
This already sounded like possible feeding, then had a message from Alyssa Scott, the new MMSN coord. for San Juan County, who received an email about this. One of the things she did say in describing the behavior of the whale was that it was extending one pec fin in the air, which really does sound like feeding behavior. - sb
