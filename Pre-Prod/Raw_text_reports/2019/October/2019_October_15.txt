A very spread group of
roughly 10 members out in front of Clinton to Mukilteo ferry lanes
; members from mid channel over toward Clinton side. Just passed right in front of the waiting
3:30 ferry departing from Mukilteo. One large male in the group, pretty sure I also saw
J31 and J56
. Moving at a steady clip north but haven't seen them make the turn toward Saratoga side. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network
Hi Alisa, Just getting around to looking at some photos I took on 10.15.19,
around
3:20pm in front of Mukilteo Lighthouse.
So far I've been able to ID
J31 and J56, J22 & J35, and J38
. Thought J26 was in the mix, too, but that photo is super far off and blurry. Those 5 I'm pretty solid on, though. It was so nice to finally be in the vicinity to "stumble" upon them. I never did get photos of that Humpback, but Cindy saw it too, and then some of the ferry crew confirmed, also. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network

15:20 - Orca
. They are in
Possession
, probably
at or past Mukilteo Lighthouse

east side of Whidbey headed north
. We're out on the water. -Kyle Bingham

I was fortunate to see some members of J-pod - in choppy seas - as they foraged
northbound by Point Wells
(south of Edmonds). They were very spread out, we ID'd
J27 Blackberry, J26 Mike, J42 Echo, J16 Slick, J39 Mako and possibly L87 Onyx
. Others were present but too far for positive ID's. It's so humbling to see these amazing mammals, they're like part of our own family. Thank you Puget Sound Express. -Jill Hein
*

11:32 - Orcas

has a small calf with her!! I didn't manage to get a photo and
J47 and J53

Hi! There is also a
humpback in the middle of the Clinton to Muk ferry heading north
into Possession. Hard to tell size, but possibly looked small (juvenile). It's been under for a minute and it fluked so I imagine it will be down for 5/10 minutes. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network
