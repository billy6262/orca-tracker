Orca Sightings for October 24, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia
- Dave was working in the CWR Photo-ID office when he heard on the radio that someone had found
SRs near the Belle Chains heading southeast toward East Point
. The weather was nice so Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1430. Dave arrived on scene about
a mile north of Tumbo Island at 1520 to find J pod, the L47s, L72s, L90, and L87 heading slowly southeast towards East Point
. They had been reported to have been really spread out earlier but had begun forming up in groups prior to arrival. Now there were several tight groups coming together to form one big loose group....Full summary and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 88.
