We are just now leaving
Port Townsend

between Port Townsend, Indian Island, and Marrowstone Island
. Out in the middle. It is 1205, the whales I saw were on the west side of Marrowstone Island, in the Port Townsend bay. I don't think you can see him from where you are....My direction is a little turned around. They were right off of Marrowstone Island heading down towards Indian Island....

Oct 17: On the 17th I saw reports they were near Port Townsend. We were camped at Fort Worden for the week so we drove to port to try to view them, with no success. The next report I saw was they had traveled north, so we returned to Fort Worden and saw them for a few moments while we were
near Pt Wilson
. They were heading north closer to the Whidbey side and way too far to identify. Regardless, seeing them not only made our week of vacation up there, but it really has been the best thing this entire year for me! -Debbie Mahder
