Orca Sightings for October 20, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun Oct 20 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - We had a wild adventure today! With strong gusts blowing from the southeast, we made our way west in search of calmer seas. This worked out well, because as it turns out this is also where all the whales were reported to be today. Our search took us deep into Canadian waters, but we were rewarded for the effort, because we found humpback heaven. There must have been
over ten humpbacks
where we were, with more scattered throughout the western Strait.
Amongst the humpbacks present were Slalom (MMZ0006), Uluka (BCXuk2017#8), and MMX0028
