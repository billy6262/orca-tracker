Hi Susan and Howard: First Some
Ls were off Comox
on Oct 23. I was on the water with
T137s and HBs
. I wasn't with the Ls but I was located in the area and wonder just how many SRs were here? Didn't look like all 3 pods. Did you hear any exact numbers? The Ts were in the same area as the Ls a few hours earlier. -Peter Hamilton

The Ts were in the same area as the Ls a few hours earlier...I will be taking stills out of the 4K video. Photos did not show the right side and fluke area but video does. He was actively participating in the foraging. That included several repeated forceful fluke slaps. He was interacting a lot with
137D
. 137D would constantly surface facing him. He was as active as all of the others with the exception of 137D who Head Viewed and Breached. I will have to look more closely and lighten the images on that dark cloudy day but
the injury looked smaller
. I will send details as soon as possible.
And this report sent with images:
T137A
, born in 2002, was the orca who was seen in September with a large undetermined wound by the fluke. On
October 23 Lifeforce found him actively participating in the family's foraging off Comox Valley. That included several repeated fluke slaps. He was interacting a lot with the youngest 137D who was born in 2012. It was interesting to see 137D and him often surfacing facing each other. He was as active as all of the others with the exception of 137D who was also Head Viewing and Breaching. Lifeforce had an approximate one hour observation period. Lifeforce was able to take photographs and video to document his progress. The wound appears to be healing well. He looks and acts normal. He is now apparently doing fine. -Peter Hamilton

Entry 3:
T046B's ~7 miles south of Discovery Island traveling south
east at a steady 6 knots. The
T046B1's, with T46B1B Tl'uk
were grouped up a quarter mile to the north of the rest of the T046B's who were slightly spread out. They were difficult to track as they were doing long dives and started trending northwards. Mark finished off the encounter at
1614
as they grouped up ~15 minutes prior and then disappeared. He had last seen them heading north for Oak Bay. -Fulll summary and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 87.
