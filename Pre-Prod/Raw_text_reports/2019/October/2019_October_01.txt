Orca Sightings for October 1, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tue Oct 1 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - With Island Adventures out of Port Angeles 10/1/2019. Calm seas, beautiful weather for the first day of Oct, this was a trip I will never forget. We
got mugged by 2 humpbacks, Stitch and Aerie (CRC-15994 & MMY0106)
. Stitch then had to show off and blow bubbles. mimicking the noise of the generators exhaust. He was so funny! Renee our Naturalist first spotted the both of them, we were out a few miles north and east of Port Angeles. Capt Shane turned off the boat engines, we were well over the 100 yd minimum protocol. but these 2 humpbacks decided they were going to check us out, and did they ever. Stitch especially....and I think he took a liking to the young ones on board. I could see and just feel it. They were adorable with him, melt my heart, thats' for sure. I had only wished I had my smaller camera as they were so close, touching and under our boat. I did the best with the lens I had 55mm-300mm. sure didn't need to zoom....wow! i think Im still in disbelief. -Marilyn Armbruster
