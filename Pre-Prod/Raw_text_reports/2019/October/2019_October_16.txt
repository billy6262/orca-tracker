Orca Sightings for October 16, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
(Oct 16th: A stormy day. No images have surfaced to confirm IDs on any of the
orcas reported in 4 locations inland Puget Sound
. Jpod & L87 had been inland since the 12th and exited on the 17th so presume they were here. Times & locations suggest others (Bigg's? Ls?) were in Puget Sound as well - alb)
*

Entry 2:
08: 15 - Orca (single?) passing Bush Point southbound
100-ish yards offshore. -Gregory Roeben

Entry 3:
Possession Sound/Port Susan Group -

14:15
- what I think I saw was activity south of Tulare Beach, thought maybe they were having luck fishing the "bubble", I'm still watching

13:40 -
I just took a long scan from the
north end of Hat Isl
. thought I saw them
south end of Port Susan
close to mainland, but really far off. so not calling it official. -Lori Christopher

two Orcas
spotted with binoculars. -Linda Campbell, camano WW

9:40 - 4-5 orcas
northbound, mid channel
between NE Hat Isl and Tulalip
. No pics this morning, too far off, but two large adults (no males) and one or two smaller ones for sure. -Lori Christopher
*

08:18 - Small group of orcas
just north of the
Clinton-Mukilteo ferry lanes
heading south. Very far off from where I'm viewing on the hill just above the Clinton terminal, headed south, so looks like more Mukilteo side. No males visible yet, but cartwheeling and breaching witnessed. Seen at
8:18am. -Amand Colbert, Orca Network

Entry 4:
17:45 - Orcas
. We found them! At least 6 including a baby,
2 males and 2 females heading south from Apple Tree Cove
on the ride home we saw them and had to cut the engine on the Kingston fast ferry. Breaching! So amazing. -Amanda Godinez
*

17:00 -
I'm sure that I saw orcas through my binoculars this afternoon off
Edmonds
. They were about half way across the Sound, and some white splashes caught my attention, then through my binoculars I could see the large black fin. They were headed south at around
5:00 pm. -Steve Zimmerlund
*

09:15 - Orcas. NB with line of sight from Apple Tree Point Kingston to Mukilteo
. At least 8 with one large male. Long down times. Mid channel too far for saddles. -Sara Frey

08:55 - Orcas.
The group is working their way towards
Eglon
. We watched them pass our Edmonds bound ferry. -Kelli Finnigan McNees

Brad WS Ferry Ops called: They are out there today, report from ferry Spokane on the

08:00 -
I'm probably about the 500th person to report this today, but we had a pod visitation on the
8:00
Mukilteo ferry
this morning. I don't know which pod it was, but I estimated at least nine members or more, and to my uneducated eye, many appeared to be youngsters. They crossed right in front of our eastbound bound such that we had to stop to let them by (northbound), and I believe they had passed in front of the westbound boat just beforehand, too. This happened to be my first-ever pod sighting, and to quote the person who stood next to me, it was magical. And no, I didn't get any pictures to speak of, but I saw many cameras and phones out, so I'm sure somebody did! -Colin Hempstead

Entry 5:
10:26 -
I am staying at the Mediterranean Inn in
Seattle
, and was just on the roof deck when I spotted an Orca swimming in the Sound. A Marine Biologist staying in my Inn confirmed the sighting. (Edit w/direction: "Surprisingly it was heading toward Downtown). -Warmest Regards, Helga Schauer
