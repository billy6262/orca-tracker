Orca Sightings for December 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Methinks I have
J-8
in one shot. Also wanted to pass on one other interesting thing we saw today that was new for me - had a group of about 5 whales that made a stragglers pass at Point Robinson (
Maury/Vashon Islands
) - lucky for us, even closer than the first gang. They were doing quite a bit of rolling frolic - and yes, I did see my first "sea snake" - wow that thing is PINK!!! What was odd, is that one of the whales surfaced once or twice with a
dorsal totally curled over
and around to the point that it looked like a upside down "U". I have never seen that before and wanted to see if you had etc.

Amy Carey was tracking the So. Resident orcas while in Puget Sound today, calling in the following reports:

10:55 am
: the orcas were crossing the
Vashon ferry lanes
, spread out and heading south at a good clip.

11:48 am
: the orcas were off
Dilworth
, NE Vashon Island, moving slowly south. Someone relayed a report to her that there were still orcas south of the North end Vashon ferry at
11:40.

12:30 pm
: a late group passed
Dilworth
at
12:30 pm, heading south.

2:04 pm
: the orcas were rounding
Pt. Robinson
, Maury Island, heading south.

3:30 pm
: Orcas were at
Gold Beach
, Maury Island, heading south.

Brad Hanson, Scott Veirs, and Marla Holt were on the NOAA Research boat again with the So. Resident orcas. Brad called at

12:17 pm
to report they were with a dozen orcas off
Dilworth
, Vashon Island, heading south. Scott Veirs reported at
4 pm
, that they were with
J & K pods
, traveling west across the mouth of Quartermaster Harbor after moving slowly down Sound spread out and blowing bubbles.

Jeff Hogan called at

10:40 am
to report
J pod
+ off Alki, heading south. He saw J1 & what looked like J27, plus more adult male fins. They were foraging, and nearing the
Vashon ferry lanes
.
*
Three male
orcas
, two females between West Seattle and Blake Island at

10:20
heading south. They're stretched from about 1/2 mile off W. Seattle to about 1 mile + out. More blows and splashes about halfway between Lincoln Park (W Seattle) and Vashon Ferry Dock at
10:32.

Just watched several
orcas
- at least four - pass by
Alki Point
heading south. They were closer to the east side.

I called to report a pod of 7-8
Orca
heading south past
Alki point
this morning around

9:30
. They were feeding and then moved quite quickly South and by the time I got in my car, they were already down near the Fauntleroy ferry. I managed only to get 2 shots - here is one dorsal at Alki (see above), the other looked to be a large male but was VERY far away by the time I got it so no ID.

Orca Network received a report of 3-4
orcas
outside Eagle Harbor,
Bainbridge Island
, seen by Janet Moring from the

8:45 am
ferry. They were milling, and appeared to be heading slowly north.
*
My 10-year-old daughter was on a field trip to Seattle this a.m. (she was on the

8:45 ferry
out of Winslow) where she reports orcas were seen, not far out of
Eagle Harbor
. She said the ferry captain pointed them out. She has seen orcas before and says the dorsal fins were very obvious. She says there were several orcas, including a young one (I'm not sure how she differentiated). Anyway, did not see mention of this on your site, and hoped that the ferry workers might confirm this sighting.
