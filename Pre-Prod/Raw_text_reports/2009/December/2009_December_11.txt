Orca Sightings for December 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Beginning at about

4:25pm
. and continuing for almost two hours the [orcas] put on quite a
symphony
over the
Pt. Townsend hydrophones
. Then at

10:58 p.m
. they showed up on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
, though this time they were faint. They could be heard until a little after 1 a.m.I posted a couple audio clips, one from PT. Townsend at the height of the symphony and another clip further toward the end and there was a call that I am not familiar with. I put an explanation of that call on my blog post as well as the audio clip. Hope your readers will enjoy the clips.

On Friday four
killer whales
were sighted at the north end of
Makah Bay
in the evening. The whales were sighted too late at night to take photos. There was one young sprouting male in the group. Light conditions were too poor to be sure that no more killer whales were in the area. The killer whales were seen at 48 degrees 18.03 minutes North, 124 degrees 45.69 minutes West and were seen at

16:54
. The whales were not really headed in any direction. They were generally oriented to the east by southeast to go further into Makah Bay.
