Orca Sightings for December 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
gray
that was sighted at the bridge to Fox Island stopped here (
Fox Island
) for a while about
9 AM
. I couldn't see it due to dense fog but could hear it clearly so it was in very close to the beach.

Saw a
Gray whale
about

1:30 PM
just off the
Fox Island
boat ramp at the Fox Island Bridge (S. Puget Sound). Quite a few people stopped in the parking lot to watch and take photos.
