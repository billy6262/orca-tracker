After receiving the report from WA State Ferries of orcas off Edmonds at

9:45 am
heading north (the exact same report as yesterday!), and calls detected early & mid-morning on the Port Townsend Marine Science Ctr. hydrophones, we set out for another day of seeking whales from viewpoints on the west side of Whidbey. We again had our first sighting of blows from Double Bluff, SW Whidbey - the whales were way on the other side again, first sighted at

1:57 pm
, off
Point No Point
, N. Kitsap Peninsula. We watched as the spouts progressed NW, and left at
2:15 pm when the spouts were north of Point No Point. We headed north, but discovered there were no spouts just north of Pt. No Point as we had expected. But we did see spouts from ~6 whales at Foulweather Bluff at
2:40 pm. We watched until

3:15 pm
- the spouts off
Foulweather Bluff
continued, the whales were possibly moving south, but direction couldn't be determined for certain. The whales further south never came back into view.

Brad Hanson, Scott Veirs, and Marla Holt were on the NOAA Research boat with
J and K pod
SE of
Point No Point
, between N. Kitsap and SW Whidbey Island at

2:45 pm
. They had traveled with the whales north to just past Pt. No Point, then at
2:15 pm the whales turned and headed SE toward Possession Bar. They were in several groups of 12-15 orcas each, and one group had come down from the NW to join these groups - so possibly the spouts we were watching off Foulweather were some trailers from that pod? Scott's report (see above) indicates they were moving N up Possession Sound by the end of the day - who knows where they will show up tomorrow - could be Saratoga Passage, Edmonds, Whidbey, Seattle?? The researchers were able to obtain several fecal and fish scale samples today from both pods.

About 8
orcas
sighted, I estimate there were more unseen, off
Pilot Point
, across the Sound from Edmonds, WA - Approximately N47 52.7 W122 30.7. They were traveling north at
2 pm
. Some males were seen further from shore. Too far away to see any identification marks.

Mary Ann Fuller called Orca Network to report
orcas
between Eglon and
Pt. No Point
on N. Kitsap Peninsula at

1:20 pm
, with a boat traveling with them (the NOAA research boat).
*
Just off of Eglon Port and between
Cultus Bay and Useless Bay
pretty much in the middle of the Sound there are so many
orcas
, I can't count. I have been watching them from

1:00 -
1:45 PM
.

George Rebman called Orca Network at

12:10 pm
, to report
orcas
in groups of 2 and 3 at
Apple Tree Pt
, N. Kitsap Peninsula, foraging and generally heading north. There were several calves and adult males with the pod.
*
In Puget Sound between
apple tree cove
(Kingston) and
Whidbey Island
, there were 6-8 individuals seen close to Ferry as they traveled up the sound between Whidbey and Kitsap. We saw them at about

11:30am
. Too far away for us to distinguish any details. They appeared to be traveling and not playing or feeding.

The Edmonds/Kingston ferry captain saw the pod of a dozen
orcas
today at the same location, time, and direction as yesterday (Pt. Wells, S. of Edmonds,

9:45 am
heading north).
