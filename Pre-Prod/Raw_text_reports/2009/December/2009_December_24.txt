Orca Sightings for December 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb spotted a pair of east bound
Killer Whales
in the
morning
south of
Victoria
through the Big Eyes. After Ken scoured the area to the south east of Constance Bank, I covered the area west of his search area and came across his probable pair headed west south of Race Rocks. Dave Ellifrit has tentatively ID'd the bull as a California animal known as CA166. I've sent off some shots to Alisa Shulman-Janiger in hopes of confirmation.

Confirmation of Dave Ellifrit's ID of the
California male Transient
Mark Malleson photographed as
CA166
: Mark Malleson's nice photo is definitely CA166. I'm not sure who this female is, but she was previously photographed with CA166 on
April 8, 2009 off Washington, in a sighting that Brad Hanson (NWFSC) on the McArthur II had reported to Orca Network.
