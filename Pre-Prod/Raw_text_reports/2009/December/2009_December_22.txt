Orca Sightings for December 22, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
This report was forwarded to us by Derek Woodie - likely another sighting of the
gray whale
reported above and in previous reports the past few weeks:
I have a question for a sea life specialist there at the aquarium. I was walking across the narrows bridge this
afternoon
and half way i saw this huge creature lounging at the water surface. It was a pinkish/peachy orange color. I got 3 pictures before it dove back down. Unfortunately the light was fading and the pictures didn t pick up the beautiful color. What do you think it is? I'd say it was 15 to 20' long Thanks,
David Eddy
From the photos sent to us, this certainly looks like a gray whale, sometimes sea lice on the Gray whales can give it a light peach/pinkish hue - sb

I heard two faint
calls
at

7:57 pm
and expected to hear more. However, for the next hour it was the noise of a ship. Then just at the end of the ship noise at

9:03
I heard a few very clear calls, for only a few seconds, and then no more.

And from Scott Veirs of OrcaSound, in response to Jeanne's recordings:
Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the nice recording. I've uploaded it to OrcaSound here. Definitely some nice clear calls (I hear S2s and S10 [squeaky balloons]). I haven't any reports of others hearing these.

We are on the bluff overlooking
Admiralty Inlet
on Whidbey. A pod of
Orcas
(perhaps
a dozen or more
) just passed through the center of Admiralty Inlet from SE to NW, between
3pm and 4pm
. Both their spouts and their dorsal fins and backs were visible as they went by. They were widely spread out.

Pt. Wilson
, heading due west and looking good!

Jason Wood and Shari Martens (on east coast) are hearing
S1 calls
on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
, as recently as

Spotted
two large Orcas
at

1:55pm
, 300 yards off
Lagoon Point
, Whidbey Island heading north towards Straight Juan De Fuca. Swimming fast with 10 second intervals to airhole breathing. Could have been Juveniles. Not sure.

Kit Turner of
Lagoon Point
, Whidbey Island, called at

1:50 pm
to report
3-4 + orcas
heading north, just past the entrance to Lagaoon Pt.
*
We had just set up to begin our scheduled marine mammal observations at Ft. Casey State Park at about

1:40 pm
, and I thought I saw what looked like a whale spout in the distance between Lagoon Pt. & Ft. Flagler, but we hadn't received any whale reports since late Monday when Js were in Puget Sound, so wondered if it was "wishful seeing". Then the phone rang at
1:50 pm, with Kit Turner's report of orcas off Lagoon Pt, confirming the spout I had seen. We gave up on our other marine mammal observations, and focused on the many spouts now appearing, spread out between Lagoon Pt. on Whidbey Island, & Marrowstone Island, heading north, with what looked like some milling back & forth. We kept an eye on their progress, and made plans to meet the boat team from Port Townsend that is part of the contract with the Whale Museum and the Snohomish PUD to monitor and record So. Residents in Admiralty Inlet. We joined Roger Slade and Chrissy McClean (PTMSC) at Keystone, and by
2:40 pm found
J pod
very spread out across Admiralty Inlet, mainly heading north, with some direction changes, but pretty much in traveling mode. Chrissy & Roger were able to get 25 minutes of great recordings of the orcas' calls, and we got some ID shots to confirm our suspicions that the pod seen in Puget Sound yesterday was J pod. We left them as they continued NW a little before
4 pm
, happy to have a little time with them before it got dark - hope they come back soon!
