Orca Sightings for December 17, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'd like to report a sighting - From on top of the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge
(as a passenger in a car), I saw
one Orca
surface. It was headed towards
Pt. Defiance
, from Fox Island. It looked as if it could've been female, since the dorsal fin was not extremely big. It looked full size. I kept looking for others to surface, but only saw that one. It was approximately

2:00 pm
.
