Orca Sightings for December 18, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Jim Whicker, reporting
7 orcas
, including 1 male, a little north of
Port Townsend
, near the buoy 300 - 500' from shore (48 7.180684 N, -122 44.507595W) from

11:10 -
11:30 am
. This was the Transient group with T74 and friends.
*
When the
orca
first appeared, surfacing less than 200 feet from where Frank and I were at
Point Wilson
. The two females moved swiftly and silently to the north where the remainder of the other orca were, three males and one female quickly grouped up with the two females. What it looked like to me was a team effort to drive any seals or sea- lions that were near the point towards the four orca who were waiting in the direction of where any pinniped might flee. It was interesting to see the close team work of the seven orca.

From the excellent photos taken by Robert Whitney and Frank White from shore at Pt. Wilson, some ID's of these Transients have been made - the male has been confirmed as
T74
(very distinctive dorsal fin!); likely IDs are T73 with 1 notch in fin, possibly w/T73C?, and T73A1, and possibly T73A - but we are waiting for confirmation on these possible IDs.

Chrissy McClean of the Port Townsend Marine Science Center called at

11:40 am
to report a pod of
~7 orcas
, including 1 male, off
Pt. Wilson
, heading north, close to the Port Townsend side of Admiralty Inlet. At

12:08 pm
she reported they were heading W/NW 2 miles off North Beach, moving quickly.

Bob Whitney of Port Townsend called at

11:45 am
to report
~7 orcas
, including possibly 3 males, heading west toward Sequim. He then sent us some photos and this update: There are a few images of the orca seen at Point Wilson a little before noon today. the two females that are close together were close, as close as I have ever seen orca to the point about 200ft away they surfaced quickly then moved north 100 yards before surfacing again then dove once again surfacing where four others joined up with the two females for a total of seven looked like three males and four females. The largest male had an old injury to its dorsal fin with a saw tooth pattern look (T74). I did not get the image of the male with the distinctive pattern on its dorsal fin but Frank did (see above photo) and I have seen the image showing the old injury.

We saw 4 to 6
orcas
near the lighthouse at Ft Worden at

11:00 a.m.
They were west bound. One had a large fin on it's back.

Orca Network received a call from Amy Traxler at the Whale Museum - they received a report on their hotline from someone who saw a
pod of orcas
at

10:15 am
from the
pt. Townsend/Keystone Ferry
. The orcas were off the N. end of Marrowstone Island- they were too distant for the reporter to get IDs, number of whales, or direction of travel.
*
We headed out to Ft. Casey State Park to look for the orcas after getting the call about orcas off Marrowstone Island. By the time we arrived, the orcas had headed west past Pt. Wilson, so we never saw them, but we did observe over
14 Steller sea lions
for 2 hours off Ft. Casey, behaving very nervously and defensive, with lots of heads up high looking around, and growling - much like they were behaving on the 12th while a pod of Transients was across the inlet attacking one of their fellow Steller sea lions!

Tracy Record of the West Seattle Blog sent this email this morning:
I know you track other whales too. just got one (secondhand) of a
gray
sighted near
Alki Point
around

9:30 am
. Reported on the blog were these three gray whale reports:

11:20 am: Only one report so far but you know how we are about sharing whale reports, in case you want to keep an eye out: "Cloudbreak" shared e-mail from a friend who e-mailed an hour ago (

10:20 am
), "OK, a few minutes ago a
gray whale
cruised by
Alki
, turned East at the lighthouse." (Maybe it was this one.) ADDED

11:57 AM
: Now a second report, closer to downtown - from Zack: I'm down at
Argosy Cruises
and we had a
gray whale
pass us and head into the east waterway - last view I got was about 10 ago and it was surfacing in between the cargo ships. Looks like it's still heading south.
Watched a small gray whale following close to shore by Salty's, past Don Armeni boat ramp, and around the point. Last seen heading West along the shore
towards Alki @
1:15pm
.LTF, West Seattle blog.

This morning at

11:00 AM
I saw a
grey whale
surface three times just south of the Coleman ferry dock in
Seattle
. I am certain the animal was a whale and not a very large seal since I clearly saw its tail out of the water before a dive. I cannot be 100% certain it was a grey whale, but its surface appearance (low broad back and no evidence of a bumpy spine or small dorsal fin before dive) strongly indicates to me that it was a grey whale rather than a humpback whale. It appeared to be a large whale but maybe not a fully adult whale. It appeared to be making deep dives rather than staying on the surface. Feeding perhaps? Do you think this is the same grey whale that has recently been reported in Bremerton harbor?
Brian Parent Bainbridge Island
Very likely the same whale observed around Bremerton and Ballard in recent weeks - sb
