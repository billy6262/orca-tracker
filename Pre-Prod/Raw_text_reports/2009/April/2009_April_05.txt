Orca Sightings for April 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Approaching
10pm
we heard one or two
grays
feeding along the west end of First St shoreline, Langley. Too dark to see any of them, but their blows are so distinct.
Sharen Heath, LANGLEY, Whidbey Island

We saw
#44 Dubknuck
, near
Camano State Park
. And another
[gray] whale
mid-channel, but didn't get a good enough photo to ID the 2nd whale.

I got some great looks at a few
transients
today in
Monterey Bay CA
while onboard the Monterey Bay Whale Watch/Sea Wolf II. I believe there was a male, two females and a calf, although I was not able to get a good photo of the calf- less female.
Jessica Riggin, California State University Monterey Bay
Reply/ID from Alisa Schulman-Janiger: I recognize the big well-marked male in your photo (above). This is CA79, a large adult transient male that was first seen off Pt. Reyes in 1989. He is primarily sighted in Monterey Bay; I saw him there in 2000. I cannot ID the female as of yet.

We saw
one gray whale
today. He was traveling north in
Saratoga Passage
about

2:30 PM
. We were on the beach between Mabana and Elger Bay when we spotted a flukes about 1000-1500 yards south of us. We got in our kayaks and headed south but didn't see any thing for about 10-15 minutes. Then a gray surfaced about 30 feet away. It went under again and then went right between us (we were about 100 feet apart) with a massive bow wake. It surfaced again about 50 feet away on the other side of us. For the next hour we kept our distance and watched as it worked it's way north, rolling on its side and blowing. It stayed on the Camano side until it got close to Elger bay, when it crossed over to the Whidbey side. There it started going deeper and blowing less frequently. After about an hour we lost sight of it.

We were coming out of the mouth of the Snohomish river & saw one
Gray Whale
, He was directly out from the USS Lincoln number 72. At
Noon
. We watched him for a short time, but the waters were shallow so we move on with our day cruise. We first spotted one
large Gray
, at 48 02 .51 NW - 22.020.77 W at

12:45
at the end of Camano Island. Then we saw a juvenile, the fins much smaller than the other ones - we could not be sure if it was one or two adults with the young one. They stayed in the area between Camano & mainland going a little north.

One Gray Whale
sighted off the East side of Camano Island in Port Susan; Country Club area. Moving south slowly down the coast; pretty close to shore, feeding, I think.

We had Gray whales pass by
Langley
