Orca Sightings for April 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jill Hein called at

6:55 pm
to report one
gray whale
feeding off Harrington Lagoon, S. of
Coupeville
, heading south. Then sent this update: The whale report I just called in - it could well have been Patch although couldn't confirm by the fluke - it didn't come high enough out of the water. But there was a large white patch on the right side, just past the dorsal. I had my scope on him - probably at least a mile and a half out.

I was able to spot at least
2 gray whales
feeding off East Pt.,
Saratoga Passage
at

12:20 pm
. I first saw them NW of East Pt, apparently coming from the direction of
Holmes Harbor/Baby Island
. They were headed to mid-channel, where I watched them feed until after

1:20 pm
- it appeared they were possibly heading slowly south, still mid- channel at that time.
