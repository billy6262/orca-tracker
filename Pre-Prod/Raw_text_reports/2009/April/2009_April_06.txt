Orca Sightings for April 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
T14
came in past
Race Rocks
at

08:30
and appeared on the Race Rocks webcam with at least seven other transient killer whales. In the group were
T123, T123A, and new calf, T123B
, pictured here (see above photo). Also in the group were the
T49's
. Report & more photos at Center for Whale Resarch

One

The Island Explorer 3 found
three Gray Whales
today! Moments off the dock we found Gray Whale #21 feeding in the
Snohomish River Delta
- this is the whale that was struck by a boat last Spring and appears to be doing quite well as the injury has healed nicely leaving a scar forward of his first knuckle. Further north we found good ol' Patch (#49) traveling with #531 who we ID'd from his repeated fluking! Great conditions and yet again fantastic whales! They seem to be putting a dent on the Ghost Shrimp population as we see them feeding in the shallows exposing their pectoral fins & partial flukes most days! Keeping Sunscreen on Hand!

Have been watching a
Gray whale
off the bluff on corner of Fort Nugent Road and West Beach (
NW Whidbey Island
). Been around for 2 days (6 and 7th). Blows a lot and seems to be eating in a circle.

Today I saw my first
orcas
of 2009, and what a sighting it turned out to be! I was out with Captain Jim on the Peregrine this afternoon and we saw
8 transients
in Haro Strait (we saw a group of 3 and a group of 5 - and there was another group reported further south). First we had the group of three including a pink little calf. I'm not sure who they were, but Ken Balcomb and others got good looks so hopefully they will report who it was. They spent about 15-20 minutes chasing a harbor porpoise around. At times it was hard to tell the calf apart from the porpoise as they both appeared so small next to the two adult females. The grand finale was a huge lunge by one of the adult females that launched the porpoise high into the air! (See first photo above.) I didn't even register it fully when I saw it but I somehow managed to click my camera and capture the proof. That was the last we saw of the porpoise, except for some lungs floating on the surface a little later. Shortly thereafter we were surprised by another group of five Ts. We knew they were in the area but thought they had headed in the other direction, so it was a pleasant surprise for them to pop up in our vicinity. The big male was
T14
, and I believe he was with the
T49s. T49B and T49B1
were both in that group, and we left them heading south while the other group of 3 was heading north.

Well, looks like the first part of the trip (onboard NOAA's McArthur II Cruise) was So. Residents and then has been transient fest ever since. After Sunday's Transient encounter we started zig-zagging south and about
4 AM
started picking up infrequent calls on the hydrophone array - we werent sure on ecotype - we were able to stay with and localize at sunrise and turned out to be another big group of
Transients
- at least 15 split into in several groups, including the whales we had Sunday afternoon! Candi and Dave are still working on the IDs but at least the
T11s, T46Bs, CA195
et al,. We were able to get out in the small boat and deployed two satellite tags - one on T11 and the other on a female-sized whale that ID is still to be determined. Robin Baird will have maps up on the Cascadia web site in the next couple of days.

Orca Network received a call from Will Elmquist, reporting one
gray whale
2 miles south of the
Mukilteo/Clinton
ferry lane, heading north, mid-channel at

3:40 pm
. By the end of the phone conversation the whale was in the ferry lane.
*

2:30 am
, Baby Island Heights (
Saratoga Passage/Holmes Harbor entrance
). I opened the deck door and was greeted by the symphony of a
very large gray
, so near the shoreline I could see it in the moonlight right beneath the high-bank. Big beautiful breaths about every three minutes until

2:50 am
. It's now slowly traveling west to Baby Island.

Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called at

1:10 pm
to report
Transient orcas
, including
T14/Pender
, & the T49's off the
Victoria
Waterfront. They had just made a kill. There was another group of Transients reported between Salmon Bank and Hein Bank as well.
