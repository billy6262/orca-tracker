Orca Sightings for April 20, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
My classmates and I were heading into Mitchell Bay after our first full day at sea when our Captain, Todd Shuster, noticed a collection of whale watching boats off in the distance. We took the opportunity to turn around and were rewarded by seeing a group of
transient killer whales
by
Sidney Island
. There was one male orca, which we later identified as
T40
, with four females or juveniles. T40 is especially easy to pick out because the tip of his dorsal fin is bent over. A few times the whales took a view of the world above them by spy hopping and jumped into the air a couple of times as well. After the initial exhilaration, we began to confer about the behavioral state of the whales.

Early this morning (
2AM
) I was delighted to hear the [
gray
] whale blowing. It was south of the south point beach in Beverly Beach,
Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey Island. I could hear it move a little to the south and then return to the north. Its breathing was very regular; it would blow about every 60 seconds. The gray whale was also seen later in the day by a neighbor on
April 20th, but not on the 21st.
