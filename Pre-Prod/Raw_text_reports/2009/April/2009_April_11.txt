Orca Sightings for April 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter 11 by Center for Whale Research was conducted by John Durban and Dave Ellifrit and Meghan and Katie Mckillop with
T14
and the
T49's
near Gooch Island, BC around

5:30 PM
. T14 may have been the male seen but not encountered with T123's earlier in the day (see report below). He seems to be wandering from group to group of transients, and is often by himself. T14 photo and report at Center for Whale Research

Encounter 10 was conducted by John Durban and Dave Ellifrit with
T123's
in Haro Strait. An adult male was seen with them when first sighted from shore, but was not with them when encountered at
1218
PM.

In Canadian waters near
Cordova Bay BC
, near Victoria, there were two
transient orca whales
. We thought it looked as if they had just killed a harbor seal and were eating what was left of it. That was at about
1400
. They stayed in that area for at least half an hour, the time we were there. Usually transients are busy traveling. Near our boat, a small (probably immature) harbor seal popped up-an appetizer to a transient killer whale.

We are on the bluffs of
South Whidbey
, just south of Sandy Pt. Just sighted at

11:00 am
one lone
gray
feeding off the northwest end of Gedney Island - Lat 48"01"30N Long 122".20.00W Traveling SE. Saw a number of blows and back only. Low tide and fairly shallow region.
Update: Just sent in sighting minutes ago on NW end of Gedney Island. Would like to amend that as it appears there is a mother and calf feeding in that area. Seem to be making a small feeding loop in area north to south in 1/4 mile area right off beach of Gedney.
