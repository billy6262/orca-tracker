Orca Sightings for April 29, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were out on the R/V Pt Lobos, operated by MBARI and saw a pod of
orcas
surfacing near our ship around

9:00am
, we were at approximately 36 47.7904N 121 53.8873. There were 8 or 9 individuals. They all seemed to be full grown, there were 3 pairs swimming and breaching next to each other and also a few singles. They were swimming towards shore (which also is following the canyon wall).

Four
Gray Whales
in
Boundary Bay
this
afternoon
, and distant blows from two more were spotted in the Southern Strait of Georgia by Captain Rich Massey. One of the whales in Boundary Bay is very recognizable, with a large white splotch just below the dorsal lump on its left side. Although some foraging was observed, the whales were mostly milling.

On
Camano Island
directly across form Langley on Whidbey Island, on a sandy spit that is very deep. At about

2:30
I noticed the spray from a whale in the middle of Saratoga Passage going north. I watched the whale for about an hour and noticed that he started heading south towards us. We walked to the shore and sure enough one big
Gray Whale
was off the point and I think looking for food. He surfaced one or twice and then his tall went up and he dove. He was down more than five minutes and surfaced right off the beach. We were so involved in watching Gray Whale #1 that just down the shore there was Gray Whale number #2 was even closer to the shore and in much shallow water, that one was heading north. We watched Gray Whale #1 for a while and then he headed south toward Hat Island.

I was at
Saratoga Beach
boat launch this evening,
8pm
and saw 3 or 4
gray whales
just off of
Baby island
(1 large and 2 or 3 smaller ones). The whales were just off of the green bouy NW of baby island right at sunset diving and appearing every few minutes but were too far out for photos etc.
