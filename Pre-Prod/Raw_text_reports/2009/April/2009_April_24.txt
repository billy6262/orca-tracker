Orca Sightings for April 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bill Ingerson called in a report of watching 2 groups of 3
Gray whales
each off Hat/Gedney Island

2:30 - 3 pm
on Friday. He was concerned because one was on its side in 3-5' deep water, he thought it was trying to upright itself, and wondered if it might have been the whale that was found dead in Saratoga Passage on Sunday. However it is more likely that this whale was just on its side feeding on ghost shrimp in the shallow waters off the island.

I wanted to report two whales traveling north just
west of the Whidbey Island navy base
at

11:30 AM
. We were out running and saw the spouts of water. It took almost 6 seconds for the full body to roll through the water and then there was a slight pinkish hump at the end of the body.

We have had great sightings of the
CA transients
in the area for a couple of weeks. I got this photo (not pictured) of a female with a distinctive notch in her dorsal. I have photos of her from last fall with a calf. There were at least 3 calves in this group as well, so I'm sure one of them was hers, although it's probably grown quite a bit since November.

Carmen Landrey called to report 1
Gray whale
feeding 30-40' off
Saratoga Beach
, SE Whidbey Island at
noon
.

My husband says he saw
3-4 grays
in the ferry lane during the
8.30
Clinton to Mukilteo ferry
run this morning. Ferry PA system said there was a 'handful' but they were bobbing up and down so much it was hard to count.
