Orca Sightings for April 1, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
High winds on the outer coast sent us back in to the Strait of Juan de Fuca late Tuesday. While patrolling the Straits of Juan de Fuca we did hear hear some
transient
calls for a short while when we were west of
Race Rocks
- array bearings indicated they were to the east but we were not able to locate the whales visually - hope to head back out tomorrow night.

4:45 PM
- Same schedule as yesterday.
One gray whale
heading north to Mabana, SW
Camano Isl
, out by the drop-off. He was sending up quite a bow wake rolling into the waves, with the sun shining off his wet back.

There have been
2 grays
feeding in
Elger Bay
this morning. They were no more than 150 feet off of shore in 8-10 feet of water. This is the first time I've seen their entire fluke in such shallow water.

I just came in from my backyard (
East Pt, Saratoga Passage
) where I definitely heard a
gray whale
in the shrimp beds below. It blew a number of times and appeared to stay in the same spot. The last one was so loud that it startled my dog who headed for the door!

I have no idea if this is of interest to you but we had an experience with
transient orcas
today just to the east of Coronado Island that simply left us gasping with joy. We are outside of
Loreto, BCS, Mexico
and on the way to a dive spot on Coronado Island. I spotted whales from some miles away and our experienced captain Pancho and divemaster Rafael managed to catch up with them about 1-mile to the east of Coronado. We slowed down noticing that the pod consisted of one male (huge dorsal) several females and calves. Total number was seven that we could count. We did not harass them and kept a measured distance. We noticed that they were about to turn north so we complied. And then for an astonishing 20-minutes, the females and calves turned to our boat and swam under, around, beside our 24-ft. craft in exuberant fun. It was astonishing. Some would come and crest right beside the boat, barely touching our side. They would retreat and then others would take their place. The male came no where near us and didn't break stride. We did notice that a baby orca was between him and a female however the four whales accompanying them continued to play with us. One other boat arrived and the scene was repeated with them. When they had their fill of us, all the orcas submerged and disappeared. We expect they were transient because their are no resident orcas here. They had white markings either from tribal conflicts or encounters with Humboldt squid. None of us brought cameras. We are trying to get in touch with the other boat to retrieve copies of whatever digital photos they took. I live in Vancouver and have had other encounters with orcas while fishing and on BC Ferries. Nothing approached today's experience. Bliss.

I noted to Jamie that this sounded similar to an experience reported to us by someone else, where the
orcas
stayed with their boat until a huge wall of
dolphins
appeared ahead, at which point the orcas took off to attack the dolphins. These folks believed the orcas were using their boat to remain undetected by the dolphins. -sb To which Jamie replied: We saw dolphins miles in the distance, discernible only by a slight wake on the horizon, when the orcas left. We didn't see the orcas re-emerge as we were already moving toward the island dive site.
