Orca Sightings for April 25, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nancy Beckvar called to report observing a
Gray whale
feeding off
Ebey's Landing
, west Whidbey Island Saturday around
11 am or noon
. She said it was between the shore and the kelp beds, and was rolling a lot with its pectoral fin up out of the water.
*
At at
Saratoga Beach
boat launch at
7pm
I was fishing with my daughter and her friend off of baby island trolling very slowly and a lone large
gray whale
appeared just in front of our boat in shallow water. The crest was white and pretty scarred up. The whale was moving very slow from shore towards the middle of Saratoga passage not diving very far.

at

I note someone saw a Minke whale off
Pt Partridge
- this bears out my sighting of what I thought was a
Minke Whale
south of Pt Partridge around
4.30 pm
.
Sandra Pollard, Whidbey Island

Orca Network received a call from a woman reporting a sighting of
5-6 orcas
off
Pt. Defiance
shortly after sunset. They were where the tidal rips are just north of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, breaching and spyhopping.
*

10:40 am
- One
Minke
whale roaming just south of Pt. Partridge, NW Whidbey Island.
Al Luneman, Coupeville

We spotted Patch, feeding on the bar south east of Hat Island around

1:30 pm
, amidst the many sailboats who were racing. On our return to Coupeville,

2:50 pm
, we found the newbie feeding by Baby Island. He doesn't like to show too much of himself - but one of his pecs showed a definite chunk missing, and rake marks on the left side.
Jill Hein and Sandy Dubpernell, Coupeville
From looking at Jill's photos, this seems to be the whale that has been observed feeding in Holmes Harbor & surrounding areas - Unfortunately, this may be the whale that was reported floating dead off NW Camano later in the morning, and confirmed dead by this afternoon (see below). S&H
