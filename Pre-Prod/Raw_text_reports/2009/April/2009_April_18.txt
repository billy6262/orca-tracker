I was kayaking off of
Strawberry Pt
on Whidbey (it's east of Polnell Pt) between
3pm and
7:30 pm
and a lone
gray
was hanging out in the area between Polnell and Strawberry Pts. all afternoon. It spent much time a couple of hundred yards offshore but came in as close a the green #3 buoy off of Strawberry Point.

My family and I were enjoying 1st Beach in
La Push WA
around
6:15pm tonight when we spotted more than 3 gray whales, several adults and at least one calf, playing and feeding off of James Island - spyhopping and partial breeching. The whales were in the area for at least two hours, the calf coming very close to the shallows and the surfers at times. From our binoculars we saw alot of activity, mostly feeding it looked like.

Sally Bigger of
Beverly Beach, Holmes Harbor
, called to report observing
2 Gray whales
spouting in Holmes Harbor, some distance apart. 1 stopped and there was a lot of activiting, swirling, etc. - possibly feeding? behaviors.

The
Mariners Cove
community was treated to
AM/PM gray
visits. At

9:30AM
, a gray came from the Southwest, spouting/rolling by. At one point, in really close, right in front of Cove canal entrance to the Marina. Just north of the canal, gray stopped to feed in shallows, before, heading off a short distance to Strawberry Point. Later, around

2:30 PM
, gray steamed out to mid- channel; heading towards Polnell Point and Rocky Point. Both visits today, were from the large gray I observed last night.
