============================================================

Entry 1:
We have been seeing
5 gray whales
in
Boundary Bay near Blaine
for three days in a row now.

A
gray whale
came by traveling from NW to SE, ~
8 pm
. The tide was pretty low and the whale was feeding near the drop off, NW of Langley. The whale moved right along to downtown Langley.
Veronica von Allwörden, NW Langley

We saw a single
gray whale
heading south- east between
Langley
, WA and Camano Island (48°03'17" N 122°24'10" W) around
7 pm
.

We sent this photo link to Cascadia Research, & got this reply from Jessie Huggins: This looks like the same whale as the one that has been seen in Holmes Harbor over the past couple of weeks. These are the best photos we've gotten of this whale so far, so we'll look for it again and see if we can find it in the catalogs.

A lone
gray
was feeding fairly deep off the
Mabana Rd
. today about

4:30 PM
. He was moving slowly south. (Must have thought he was on the Whidbey side of Saratoga Passage!)
Barbara Brock, Camano Island

There was a single
gray whale
off the beach just south of Marrowstone Point in the
afternoon
. - Saw it on the surface twice at about

4:15
a quarter mile south of the point.
Ron Hirschi, Marrowstone Island

My wife and I were kayaking just south of Bells Beach and were returning to
Langley
around four o'clock when
a single gray
heading north stopped to feed. We watched it for about 45 minutes. No other boats around, just us and the whale.

We had an additional single
grey
outside
Steveston BC
at
2 p.m
.

At

12:45 PM
we were surprised by a small
gray whale
that suddenly surfaced right next to our boat as we were running at 8 knots coming into
Port Hadlock
Marina. We immediately shut down and coasted for 20 seconds and had the whale again surfacing approximately 15 feet in front of our Tollycraft before sounding in 58 Feet of water. The whale then went through the passage between the island and Port Hadlock heading north. It then surfaced again between our boat and a following boat and resurfaced within 10 feet of their boat.

5 gray whales
in Boundary Bay near
Blaine

At

8:30AM
saw spout 100 yards SW, probably, heading up from Polnell Point, again. Large
gray
cruised by and camped out a bit 100 yards NE. I went down to rock spit at Mariners Cove marina entrance. Gray passed entrance right below me and headed/fed in bay shallows near Strawberry Point. Then, continued on to hang out/feed? right off Strawberry Point, until noon. Maybe longer. Even though, I have a limited understanding and experience; I still am persuaded this is a dominant large gray male. When with the other gray last week and when kayaker neared yesterday, it seems to usurp a presence of authority. Raising itself higher in the water [to show how big it is?] type of thing. Have not noticed this behavior before when observing Saratoga grays. Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor

According to others on the beach,
two orcas
swam past
Marrowstone Point, Admiralty Inlet
heading north at about

3:30
. Didn't see them, but lots of others got to.
Ron Hirschi, Marrowstone Island

Five grey whales
have been feeding at Crescent Beach,
Boundary Bay B.C
. right along the international border. They arrived on Thursday
April 16th, and have been observed every day since then.
