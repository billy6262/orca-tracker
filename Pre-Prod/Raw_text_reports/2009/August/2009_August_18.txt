I've seen some
transients
between
Campbell River and Quadra Island
. I followed the animals with my bike until the south of Quadra Island, and with binoculars. The 4 (or 5? A big male for sure!) moved to the south.

A
superpod
of Southern Resident
Orcas
passed by
East Point Saturna Island
between

5:20 and
6:15pm
, heading west in Boundary Pass. Beginning with with about 10-12 K's and J's, then a second wave of mostly J's and ending with a third wave of mostly L's, there appeared to be a least 50 whales in total, possibly more. L2's and J2's identified, as well as K12 and K13 among other positive IDs. In contrast to recent weeks, they put on an amazingly energetic display, with so many percussive demonstrations going on that we were overwhelmed with the sound of whale bodies hitting the water from every direction. At it's most intense, there were up to five whales breaching simultaneously, and this continued along with tail lobbing and pec slapping until the last of them were out of sight around the Java Islets, at approximately 7pm. Along the way, there was a lot of back- tracking and cutting across the east-west flow, and much milling around when they reached Monarch Head near the mouth of Narvaez Bay.

We saw the [
orcas
] by the ferry terminal and spread apart past
point roberts
. We saw some members of J pod, L pod and L2's but there may have been more. Here is a nice breach just off point roberts.

Jill and I saw [

Pt Roberts
.

Five (5)
Ocra's
were sighted this morning at

11:10 AM
just south of Whiskey Point on
Quadra Island BC
. Approximate coordinates are: N 50° 02.165; W 125° 12.917'. They were heading south toward Cape Mudge at the southern tip of Quadra Island and toward the Strait of Georgia. We estimate the dorsal fin of the largest orca to be around 5 feet in height.
