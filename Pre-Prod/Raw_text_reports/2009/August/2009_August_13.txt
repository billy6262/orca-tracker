Orca Sightings for August 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving the report below about
orcas
in
Admiralty Inlet
, we headed over to the west side of Whidbey Island to try to find them. At
7:05 pm we watched many Harbor porpoise feeding off Bush Pt, then at

7:15 pm
we finally spotted a large fin & several small ones way across the inlet, just SE of Foulweather bluff. They were slowly working their way NW, with some direction changes & likely hunting behaviors noted. We saw
4 orcas
total, including 1 adult male and a juvenile or calf. They remained on the other side of the inlet, but from our distant photos, Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research made a tentative/possible ID of the bull as T10B, based on fin shape. We watched the pod continue NW for an hour, at
8:15 pm they were nearing the SE end of Fort Flagler, still heading out.

(N. Kitsap Peninsula), reporting
3 orcas
, including 1 adult male, in Skunk Bay at

6:05 pm
, heading slowly toward Useless Bay, Whidbey Island.

T14 'Pender
' graced us with his mighty presence today. He was found approximately 2 miles south of
William Head
, Vancouver Island. He was traveling slowly east. It was good to see him again even if all alone in the Strait of Juan De Fuca. He is still looking good for his age. over 40+. Last time I saw him he was keeping company with a few other Transients earlier this year.

Dall's porpoise
while kayaking in
Useless Bay
, off
