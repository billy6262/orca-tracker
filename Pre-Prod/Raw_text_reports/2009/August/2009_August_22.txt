Orca Sightings for August 22, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our vessel Fastcat was a couple of miles south of
Discovery Island
when we suddenly received word from another boat that they had spotted
Orcas
. When we arrived on scene and one of the Orcas was identified as T63 "Chainsaw" plus T-41, T-41A along with a couple more Orcas. The Orcas moved to Seabird Point off Discovery and then began to travel West towards Victoria. They passed right by Victoria Harbor and we left the Orcas at the end of our evening trip hunting near Haystock Island.

Saturday at
10 AM
the
residents
were heading west past
Jordan River
(S. Vancouver Island).
Peter Hamilton, Lifeforce

J-pod
was heading west just after the tide turned to flood against them, and they struggled mightily against the current. I set myself up on a rock as far into
Boundary Pass
as is possible here, right were a tidal rip occurs and the orcas habitually come very close to the shore travelling along the kelp beds. They are just right there -- you can practically touch them!
