Orca Sightings for August 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hello my name is Joe Arispe im a comercial fisherman. I spotted 3
orcas
while fishing offshore of
Coos Bay Oregon
. The boat was trolling when we spotted the Orcas 200 yards off the stern. They seemed to be showing off as they stayed with the boat for a good ten minutes surfacing in the wake and flopping on their backs. The Lat Long was 4354.225 and 12615.135.

1:18 am - OrcaSound hydrophone
NW San Juan Island: Whistles quite loud now along with widely-spaced clicks, occasional calls, and some very weird low-frequency creaking+g/rumblings. Faint whistles and calls heard at Orcasound since
00:39. Details in Google spreadsheet (link at OrcaSound along with recordings).

We heard whales last night, about

12:45 am
, going N, very close to our west side home, just north of
Bellevue Point
. Loud enough to get up and stand by the window to listen.

12:13 am

I was listening to the Lime Kiln hydrophone (OrcaSound.net) tonight (Aug 4) between

11:15pm-
11:49pm
. Lots of loud, fairly clear vocalizations that sound like L's: a long note going up at the end (sounds like S19 calls(?), but many with less of a sharp up at the end than S19). Calls faded by
11:49pm. As I was typing up this email I turned Lime Kiln back on - lots of very loud calls! (very loud from

12:14am to
12:19am
, then fading in and out). Too many for me to distinguish but many different ones, including some very long squeals.

My brother called to tell me he saw
orcas
breaching off of the Tsawwassen ferry terminal off
Vancouver
, BC at

7:20 pm
. He thinks he saw about 6 animals.
