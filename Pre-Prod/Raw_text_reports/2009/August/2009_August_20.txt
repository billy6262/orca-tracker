============================================================

Entry 1:
At

the
orcas
were once again off
Pt. Roberts
and headed South.
Peter Hamilton, Lifeforce

Saw what appeared to be a
gray whale
between the southwestern end of Hat Island and North
Everett
yesterday morning around
9am
. It was quite a distance from us.
Rebecca Hadley, Freeland

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING vocals on
lime kiln
right now (

11:13 pm
) - the super pod made it back down from
Boundary
! They have been vocalizing for over an hour now.
John Boyd, San Juan Island
*
Party on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
right now (

10:30pm PST
).
Ruby Keefe, CA

9:42 pm
- LOTS of faint, nearly continuous calls on BOTH
Orcasound and Lime Kiln hydrophones
.
Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound, Seattle

A beautiful and educational day on the water with many members of
J and K pods
off
Lime Kiln Park
around
1.00 pm
. The conditions were choppy with the Orcas intent on foraging and exhibiting some lively behaviour - tail-lobs, pectoral waves and breaches. Also one
Minke
whale.
Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island

1:36 pm:
Just started hearing S16 and other (
Southern Resident) calls
at
Orcasound
(NW San Juan Island).
12:02 pm: Just started hearing S16 calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones. No calls at Orcasound since 10am, so they're likely northbound. Recording of Lime Kiln transit is now at OrcaSound.net here (scroll down in player to 090820).
