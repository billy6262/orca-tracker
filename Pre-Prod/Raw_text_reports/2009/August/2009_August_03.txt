Orca Sightings for August 3, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod and K-Pod with some L's
breaching their way south, against a strong flood tide, down
Rosario Strait
past Burrows Lighthouse, from

2:50pm to
3:50pm
.
Caroline Armon, San Juan Island

We spent a good hour watching lots of broaching, with many
Orcas
leaping completely out of the water,
3 pm
. Must have been over 20 Orcas total. Approx. 1/4 mile off
Washington Park, Anacortes
. Seemed to just be playing and not moving in any particular direction.
Bill Rowlands, skipper of sail boat, "Sweet Surrender"

7:45 to
8:30 pm
lots of
orcas
cruised past the south end of
Lopez
. Changes in direction, breaches, two very small orcas with females towards the end of the group.

Today we had early morning reports of
L Pod
south of
Lopez Island
, but the thick fog prevented anyone from actually finding them. In the meantime,
Js, Ks, and some Ls
that had been up north yesterday came down
Rosario Channel
. We caught up with the whales near the Burrows Lighthouse, and even from 1 mile away, it was evident that the whales were excited about something. You could see the huge splashes of breaches against the shoreline, and then you'd spot a bright white chin during a spyhop. We paralleled whales about 250 yards away, and began counting the breaches - we stopped counting at 32, even though there were more. The highlight of all these acrobatics was a rare (for me anyway) double breach. The whales were working against a flood tide, but managed to find every back eddy they could to move southward. We saw J30 Riptide, and J26 Mike (both easy to spot from long distance), and we saw one of the two new J calves.

What a day down in
Rosario Strait
! We were seeing whales from
all three pods
and what a show they put on! Lots of breaches, spyhops and loads of other activities!

At about

4:30 pm
we received a call from Jeff Hogan, relaying a report of Southern Resident
orcas
between Deception Pass and Colville (S. Lopez Island). Also heard from John Boyd that they had j's and k's heading towards deception around
4:30pm.
