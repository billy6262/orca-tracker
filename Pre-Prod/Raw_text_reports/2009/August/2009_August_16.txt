Orca Sightings for August 16, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
6pm
from Fort Worden near the light house we saw
2 Gray Whales
off of
Port Townsend
. They were feeding about 70 feet from shore. They were in the area for about 1 hour before swimming off.

Orcas
were back off
Pt. Roberts
at
1630
and heading south. They were quite spread out in small groups.

The Ocean Magic out of Victoria encountered the
T101's
in
Haro Strait
near Kelp Reef. 4 animals in total. All four members of this group were traveling into
Active Pass
with the BC Ferry boats and other marine traffic. They were seen to swim right along side the Ferry vessels.

A
superpod
was heading south from the
Coal Port
towards Light House Marine Park at

4:15pm
, then in the general direction of Orcas Island. They were spread out several miles wide and it took about 45 minutes for all of them to go by. They were very active with spyhopping, speedswimming, tail slaps and breaches. The most interesting thing that I saw was a very tight family of approximately 9 orcas swimming so close together that they were almost touching while all of the others were in spread out. It looked like there was a baby tucked into the group and several juvinilles.

Through binoculars from the shore, we saw one
Gray Whale
circling the bay off
Everett
, about 1 mile from shore at

1:30 pm
. A boat had stopped and the whale swam up to within a few feet of the boat.

Sunday
evening
. The majority of all 3 pods of
Orcas
had been at the Fraser River all day, presumably feeding on salmon migrating back to their spawning grounds. Although the whales had changed from a southbound direction to more of an eastbound one -
towards Blaine
, Washington we made it! The Resident Orcas were spread out, the water was glassy so you could see their blows a mile or 2 out! The lowering sun glistened on their black dorsal fins. We were shut down, as mother K22 (Sekiu) and her son, K33 (Tika) swam off our port bow, then double-backed in the opposite direction. We dropped the hydrophone in at one point and the Orcas were busy vocalizing! There was a possible J pod female traveling with K22 & K33. The occasional breach in the distance could be seen & heard - blubber on water - there's no other sound quite like it! We turned to start heading home, and stopped to get a great look at L41 (Mega) and his grandmom L12 (Alexis).

We were completely surprised today to find
superpod
in
English Bay, [Vancouver]
!!! They slowly started moving south all day and gave us some incredible activity along the way. We had a few breaches, lots of tail slaps and big groups traveling close together with Vancouver International Airport in the background and the last in a beautiful breach from L22.
