Orca Sightings for August 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dripping wet fog in the Strait of Juan de Fuca echoed the breathing of
Orcas
working the flooding tide from
Hein Bank
toward False Bay, long before we saw them! We carefully made our way off of Eagle Point and shut down from about

3:00pm to
3:30pm
to listen for and watch some L-Pod whales pass through the thick marine layer that only gave limited visibility. L-72 Racer's unique saddle patch made for easy identification from a distance, as she swam in and out of the fog. Although we didn't see them, hearing J-Pod calls through the hydrophone along with the powerful exhalations of all the whales out there, gave us a glimpse into their acoustically oriented world.

We saw the
T10 transient
group in
Captain Passage
just off of
Salt Spring Island
. They were traveling quite slow and not doing anything too active but was awesome to see that massive dorsal fin of T10B.

I have an
orca
report from a fishing friend who was on
Marrowstone Point
around
8 a.m
. when he saw
four orcas
just off the point. Based on size, he thought it was two adults and two calves. The whales swam directly at the tip of the point where Steve and another fisherman were up to their waists, casting for salmon. Steve got out of the water on seeing bubbles close to shore, "well within casting distance" - -- which would be about sixty feet for our light gear.

We have had an amazing (Northern Resident) Superpod and they are all still moving in towards Johnstone Strait. We had the A30s, the A12s, A11s with Springer, A23s, A25s, I15s, I31s, R5s, R2s, C6s, C10s and many more. Here are a couple of pics (here & above under Photo of the day)

This morning at

11:15
, I was flying back from
Everett
to Whidbey and saw two
gray whales
feeding in the shallows west of Everett. They looked like the two that have spent the summer in that area.

Residents have returned to our waterways! After 2 days in the Strait and ocean, members of the fish-eating
Orca
community have made their way back towards
San Juan Island
. One whale spyhopped twice taking a peak above the water. With the hydrophone in we were able to hear more echolocation and vocalizations. The Orcas were lost again in the fog, when we were graced with views of at least a dozen Orcas - lots of directional changes, they seemed to be fishing (we saw several salmon jump throughout the afternoon). I was able to ID J28 in the mix with several L pod members. L72 with her 5-year-old son L105 and and his uncle L95 were amongst the Orcas.

After receiving the below reports, Howard headed over to the west side of Whidbey to try to find the orcas. At

7:14 pm
he spotted the
orcas
from
Lagoon Pt
, just south and about a mile out. He was able to see the male's fin, and a glimpse of another fin or two, but then a fog bank rolled in and they were no longer visible, so unfortunately no photos or ID's could be obtained.

Orca Network received a call from Elsa Leavitt at

6:08 pm
, relaying a report form her neighbor of an
orca
off
Bush Pt
, SW Whidbey Island, heading north close to shore. She headed out to look for it, and called back at
6:49 pm saying she finally found 1 male and several other orcas about 1 mile offshore, just NW of the Bush Pt. lighthouse, heading north at a good clip.

Orca Network received a call from Alex Desoto at
6 pm
, reporting a single male
orca
heading north off
Bush Pt, SW Whidbey Island
, very close (20-30') to shore near the Bush Pt. lighthouse.
