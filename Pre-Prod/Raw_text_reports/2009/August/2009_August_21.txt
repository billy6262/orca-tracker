Humpback
whales are being seen almost daily now off the
Victoria Harbour
, certainly all this week they have been reported. We saw three ambling around in large circles Weds
August 19th on the 3.30 pm Ocean Magic trip. One or two others have been seen south of Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. Great to see these wonderful 'gentle -giants' back in these waters on a regular basis once again.

We were out fishing today around

2:30
near
Mosquito Pass
a mile or so south off NW side of
SJ island
and a huge pod came by - what an amazing site and sound, they were very active and the salmon were jumping everywhere!

Between

12:45 and
1:00pm
, about 18
orcas
passed
East Point, Saturna Island
in Boundary Pass heading west. All the whales that I could ID were members of J-pod. They arrived at Boiling Reef just at the beginning of flood tide, and by the time they were just north of Skipjack Island, the current was already quite strong against them. They were clearly struggling to make headway. 6 whales including one adult male abandoned the main channel and headed back towards Saturna's shore where they could avoid the strong currents by swimming in the tidal shadow created by Monarch Head. They travelled all the way to the Narvaez Bay before making a left turn and heading south, slowing briefly to do some breaching and tail lobbing before re-entering the currents of
Boundary Pass
to meet up with the others. It was about
2:10pm before the stragglers reached Taylor's Point and went out of sight.

We started listening to
orca calls
on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophones
(west San Juan Isl) around
noon
, & were treated to several hours of great calls as Southern Residents headed north. At
2:38 pm we heard a few calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone (NW SJI), with ship noise in the back ground, so the whales were moving north.
