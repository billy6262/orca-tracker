Orca Sightings for August 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nice to see
J-Pod
off of
False Bay
from

2:17pm to
3:25pm
. J-2 Granny once again in the lead as she headed offshore toward the southwest, with J-1 Ruffles following. The rest of J-Pod were spread in a line between them and the shoreline, foraging. Not much of an ebbing tide, they seemed to circle back and we realized there were some K-Pod whales with them. Whales rolling over each other and quite a bit of tactile behavior- mating?! The first Northern Phalaropes of the season gathered at the surface too.

A few

We met up with members from
J, K and L pods
off of
False Bay
(W. San Juan Isl). The J pod males were there, along with either L7 "Canuck" or L77 "Matia", and as we left the area we saw K40 "Raggedy" and K21 "Cappuccino" heading east with some others. All-in-all there was quite a large number of orcas in the area.

We found
K pod
off of
point roberts
. They were vocalizing like crazy! We had breaches, spyhops, tail slaps and lots of foraging!
Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Just saw a male and a female
orca
just off
Edith Point, Mayne Island
heding east - feeding I think just off the reef there off Campbell Bay,
10 am
. They were circling and diving then coming up and repeating that. for about 15 minutes then headed south past Georgeson Island.
