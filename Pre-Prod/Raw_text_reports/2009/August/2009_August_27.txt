Orca Sightings for August 27, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
My name is David Kirner, Marine Technician and Research Vessel captain for Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary. We were transiting from Port Angeles to La Push and spotted 1 sub-adult & 2 possibly 3 juvenile
orcas
just off
Crescent Bay
about 3 - 4 miles out. The sub-adult looked to be female (shorter, more rounded dorsal), while the juveniles were small enough to be this year's calves. They did not seem to be in any hurry, in tight formation, transiting in a westward direction, from approximately

7:30 -
8:00 am
. The saddle patches I did notice were more gray in color rather than brilliant white.

All three pods
were spread apart when we first saw them just south of
active pass
, but once they all went through the pass it was incredible to watch so many whales going through the little pass! We got spoiled with lots of breaches, slaps and spyhops.

Today had two interesting occurrences that I wanted to share. Early this morning we had
all three pods
spread along
San Juan Island
. They were rocketing up the west side amongst the many private fishing boats and the commercial fishing boats that were jockeying for position to set out their nets. Soon the lead whales were long out of sight, leaving us with members of the L2s and L12s. Two interesting observations-- this group of approximately 10 whales spent the ENTIRE DAY in a very tight group, traveling at what would be called a resting pattern. It went on for over 8 hours. They would surface for 3-5 breaths, and then down they'd go for upwards of 5 minutes. I can't recall the last time I saw an extended resting pattern like this. The second interesting occurrence was that while J Pod, K Pod and most of L Pod went up Swanson Channel and into Active Pass, the L2s and L12s actually went up Swanson Ã‡hannel and made a sharp right into Navy Channel! I have no recollection of residents doing this for at least the last 13 years I've been on the water. They pretty much maintained the tight grouping, and once they went South into Plumper Sound (between Saturna & Pender Islands), they did 4 direction changes (during which time they spread out to about 100 yards before coalescing back together & these changes were usually preceded by a spyhop or two). For over 2 hours they were in Plumper Sound, and only the fading light and late hour forced our departure.

We came across the
L12s and maybe L22s
today in
Swanson Channel
. These were the trailers, with the rest of the residents spread out to
Active Pass
. The orcas were closely grouped together and slowly traveling up North Pender Island with little to no apparent feeding going on.

Orca Network received a call from Perry Edwards on board the Salt Chuck out of N. Vancouver, reporting "orcas everywhere!" heading north past west
San Juan Island
& spread out north of Henry Island (48 37.145; 123 12.709) at

10:50 am
. It was
all 3 Southern Resident pods
- some headed east into Spieden and some west west of Stuart Island into Boundary Pass.

Lime Kiln Hydrophone
, S1 calls.

I was skirting the tide flat off of Jetty Island (near
Everett
) and thought I would need to tack as I saw a huge wash to leeward. I could not believe it when I saw a huge [
gray
] whale wallowing in the very shallow water spouting. There were two separated by the shallows of the sandbar in the center of the tide flat. I hope they are OK as the tide was due to head out.
