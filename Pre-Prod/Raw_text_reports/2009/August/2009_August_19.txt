At
1700
some
Ls
and what looked like Raggedy K40 (I have seen her many times over the years swimming with those L males) were heading North from
East Point to Point Roberts
. They stopped many times along the way to play and socialize. L78 had a fresh wound about the shape of a 12 inch ruler below the two "rakes" that were previously reported. Another male had two maybe three long thin marks that went nearly right across the dorsal fin. The orcas were off the park at sunset.

At
10 PM
I heard a "BLOW" outside my cove (off Sansum Narrows,
Salt Spring Island BC
). A whale blew about 3 times and we all heard one blow before they disappeared south, and we then heard the distant breath of a whale/s. It seems as if they were travelling fast.

About

7:30pm
until

8:30pm
there were [
orcas
] on the west side of San Juan Island. I for sure saw J17 and J44 - and J44 was quite active! Jumping completely out of the water multiple times.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales & Soundwatch called Orca Network at

8:15 pm
to report he was hearing
calls
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
.
*
Between

5:15 and
6:00pm
, at least 18 members of
L-pod
passed
Saturna's East Point
heading Northeast into Georgia Strait. Very good ID's on almost all of the 18, including two, L72 and L92, who were seen exactly 24 hours earlier going in the opposite direction past East Point, coming back from the Georgia Strait. Other certain ID's include L22, L25, L27, L41, L72, L92, L94, L95 and L105. I followed them heading East, in Boundary Pass, from Monarch head at about
4:30 to East Point 45 minutes later. They ran very close to shore, as they usually do going East, cutting through the kelp beds, breaching and tail lobbing a fair amount along the way.

1:17 pm
: Hearing first
calls
on the
Orcasound hydrophones

Lime Kiln

12:00-
12:30, none in last 5 minutes, now some more. Val sees them now, they are heading N and now we hear clicks on the Orcasound hydrophones.
