Entry 1:
There were some incredible
vocalizations
today. The orcas must have been close to the lighthouse as they were quite loud.

Orcas
spread out south of
Hannah Heights
at

3:45 pm
. We thought they were headed our way, but they headed south. We also observed many Harbor and Dall's porpoise off Hannah Heights all three days we were on SJI (8/30 & 31 & 9/1).

We were out on the water just outside
Shilshole
marina in Seattle and we saw
marine mammals
I could not identify. They were small- much smaller than orcas- (more like the size of belugas), dark in color, and they had a small "nubbin" on their backs rather than a true fin. We saw a tail at one point so we knew they weren't seals rolling around in the water. We saw them multiple times out in the water past the marina, and off the coast of Discovery park. Do you know what they were? I have been searching online for fin identification photos to figure this out, but have been unable to solve the mystery. I studied whale phonations in college so I do have some knowledge, but this has me stumped!

I15s
in
Johnstone Strait

noon
, they were moving from the bight to West Cracroft Island. We've also seen a large group of dolphins, around Kelsey bay.
