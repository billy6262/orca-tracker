Orca Sightings for August 31, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
While at anchor on the east side of
Eagle Island WA
(near Olympia), we had a FANTASTIC up-close-and-personal show by
4 Orcas
around

5:00pm to
5:30pm
. All orcas certainly looked healthy. We think one in the group looked smaller than the other three. We observed what we think was feeding as the seals are certainly abundant on the island. We watched as they dove as a group, and at times, only one orca jumping at a time, but always re-grouping !!!! ABSOLUTELY fascinating !!!!!! They continued to swim south through Balch Passage towards Dana Point. We hope this information is helpful. We feel so very, very lucky to have observed these beautiful creatures !!!

A great treat today around

4:30
to watch from our shoreline about
25 orcas
head east through
Active Pass
. They were moving in small groups of 2 - 5, very spread out. Some tail slaps, body rolls, and breaches. Some big splashing about in some kelp beds. Sideways swimming under the water just in front of us. J pod?

From Karoline's photos, we have ID'd members of both J and L pods - sb

I have to say the
Grey whales
off of
Jetty Island
(Everett WA) must be quite happy to be there. We sailed up to Fort Flagler and saw them again in the shallows next to the day shape off of Jetty Island.

5 Transient Orcas
were at the south end of
Vashon Island
. It looks like others saw them. A small rental boat from Pt. Defiance was following them.

With so many salmon in the area, it's no surprise that the whales don't seem to be in a hurry to go away. Today we started the day on the west side with sunny skies, while the eastern side of San Juan and the Strait of Juan de Fuca were pretty socked in with fog. I watched from shore as purse seiner after purse seiner plied the west side of San Juan in search of salmon. But they had plenty of competition as whales from J Pod, K Pod, and L Pod worked the same currents as the fishermen. By
afternoon
, it was time for us to leave the dock, and we had a choice of seeing the
L2s and L12s
down at
Hannah Heights
, or go north towards
Turn Point
and see
Js, Ks and the rest of Ls
. No brainer to me--so off we went up north. The whales were traveling a bit more slowly at this point, so it gave me plenty of time to talk about orca life histories, feeding patterns, and of course the guidelines. Soon the first whales were close enough to ID, and it was none other than K21 Cappucino and K40 Raggedy. Soon there were dozens of dorsal fins at the surface as the first half of J Pod swam by. J1 Ruffles in close attendance to mom J2 Granny. J30 Riptide playing with his family. J22 Oreo and her sprouting son J34 Double Stuff. It was great to see the family close together and rolling around on top of each other, swimming upside down, tail slapping. Soon a spyhop had our passengers oohing and ahhing, a perfect segueway to what the behavior was and why we think they do it. As Ruffles came to the surface again, someone asked about him breaching, and I said I had only seen him breach 4 times in the last 13 years. Well, he must have heard me and thought it was time for number 5, as he breached right after the comment!

J, K, and some L pod
members were all traveling together this afternoon! Somewhat of a superpod. (Other members of L pod were at the south end of San Juan Island today). They had been moving along to the north, when we arrived in
Swanson Channel
, a waterway in the Gulf Islands they were just slowing down and gathering together. We watched a big group with lots of whales all busy socializing! Amongst the group were J26, J33, 2 year-old J42, J19 & calf J41, L72, K12, K22 along with many others. Somewhat of a little happy hour - lots of activity at the surface: tail slaps, rolling over, pec slaps, half breaches, cartwheels. It was awesome.

Loud clear
calls
and echolocation from
Lime Kiln
- I began hearing at

We watched
orcas
off
Hannah Heights
from

9:30 -
10:45 am
, spread out & foraging with a few direction changes, but heading north through the fishing fleet. Through photos & confirmation from the Ctr. for Whale Research, we found it was
Js, Ks & part of L's
in this first group. At

11:40 am
, another smaller pod passed by heading north, later ID'd as the
L12s
. From
2 -
3:30 pm
, small pods of orcas came by heading south (L12s & L2s), some closer in and some quite far out. At
5 pm
, we watched the smaller pods pass by again heading north, most of them further offshore. What a treat to get to have a few quiet days on San Juan Island watching the whales go by!

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called Orca Network at

11:30 am
to relay a report she had heard of
3 orcas
near Talequa. She headed out to find them, calling back at noon to report observing 4 - 6
Transient
orcas just off Camp Sealth, coming up
Colvos Passage
. At 2 pm they were off the south end of Vashon Island - she watched them off the Lisa Beula area as they went back & forth between Vashon & the Kitsap Peninsula, then head south on the Kitsap side. At

2:24 pm
she was watching from S. Vashon Island as they headed south on the far Kitsap side, out of sight.

We just (

12:50
) got a call from D. James of Olympia area who is watching four
killer whales
travel east from Eld Inlet into Dana Passage. The whales were porpoising and diving, and there were salmon leaping in the general area.
