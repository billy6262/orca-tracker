Orca Sightings for August 23, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Howard was on the Anacortes/San Juan Island ferry doing naturalist talks, and at

11:30 am
he saw 3
orcas
including 1 adult male just north of the ferry lane in Rosario Strait, heading SW toward Lopez Island. At

1:45 pm
on the trip back, he saw 4 orcas 1/4 mile SE of the
Lopez ferry dock
, milling close to shore. Likely Transients.

Orca Network received a call from Gary Lagerloef reporting seeing 4
orcas
on Sunday near
Thatcher Pass, Rosario Strait
at

10:15 am
. There were 3 adults and a calf, heading north.
*
During the afternoon we came upon three different groups of
Transient Orcas
, one in
Rosario Strait
, another (the T10's) near
Middle Bank
and the final group near
Beaumont Shoals
. This final group was 7 or 8 Orcas that included 2 Calfs several females and the lone male T31! As we arrived on scene they had just made a kill, probably a Harbor Seal and then began to move South Eastward.

We headed a few miles west of Crescent Beach (
Port Angeles
) after receiving reports that a
Gray Whale
had been sighted nearby. As we arrived on scene we could see the Whale was feeding on the bottom and coming up regularly. At first it was moving backward and forward but then after about 15 minutes began to travel in a westerly direction.
