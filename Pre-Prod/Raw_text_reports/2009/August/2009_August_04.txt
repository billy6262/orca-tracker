Orca Sightings for August 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched many members of
J, K and L pods
heading in from the west. I don't believe all members of the pods were together in the large group of Orca we saw just off the
Victoria
waterfront as I would say only 45 whales were present. I was able to ID L78 whose scars appear to be healing nicely, J1 and J2, J30, J8, J 41, J19 and J42, J27, and one of the very small babies. K21 and K40 were there along with many others that were hard to determine on brief visits for air at the surface. It was fascinating to see the little ones briefly spyhopping and tail slapping as if to say, "Well I am awake now." It was a lovely evening with the setting sun turning dorsal fins bronze, while the orca continued past in a slow resting formation.

We were with 10
Transients
at
Discovery Island
watching them head west, and had reports of
Js & Ls
inbound. Apparently around
5:30pm, the whales passed about 100 yards from each other, but neither displayed any behavioral changes as far as we've heard!"

At
4pm
or shortly after driving north on Hwy 1 not far north from Goat Rock State Park (between Jenna &
Mendocino, CA
) I saw a few blows and some people standing along the fence line back off of shore. I pulled over and sure enough, I counted 11 different spouts. Very large, tall spouts with a couple of smaller spouts. Definitely
Blue Whales with one Humpback
. They were feeding in the area and not traveling in any particular direction. We watched them for over an hour. Two Blues were close to shore several times. I was surprised to see Blue Whales so close to shore. Beautiful sight indeed. Regards,

Managed to intercept orcas for viewing for about 1/2 hour off the banks of the
Straits of Georgia
.
9 transients
, 2 babies, 2 males (which 1 was a large bull) - rest females. All cruising and diving. No play. Babies in front would occaisionally frolic. Close to rocks, then away from shore a distance. No residents seen at all.
