6:12 p.m
. Loose groups were spread out across the strait. The encounter ended at

3-4
Orcas
observed at
Lincoln City, OR
, at Roads End, traveling north at
7pm
. Spotted the spray first - they seemed to be traveling rather than circling.

The
3.30pm
Ocean Magic 2 vessel saw the Southern Resident
Orca
group up together off
San Juan Island
. What was interesting was 'Granny', J2 was swimming with L41, 'Mega' and 'Ruffles 'J1, was swimming with K12, 'Sequim'. It sure looked like so many that can be easily identified were mixed up with members of different pods. They were all travelling north past Lime Kilm. There are so many big male fins in the SR's now especially when all three pods come together.

Heard lots of VERY active
clicks, calls
, and activity at
Orcasound hydrophone
from
11am-12pm
.It was the most active sound time we've heard yet in our 2.5 weeks of listening.

The [
orcas
] passed by (
Lime Kiln
, San Juan Island), not once, not twice, but 3 times - each pass by becoming more incredible!

I just returned (

2:20 pm
) from land bank having watched one of the most incredible passes along the west side that I have ever seen. Members of
all three pods
were heading south- in resting lines heading directly into the kelp beds. Just as the first row of J pod approached, I believe it was Granny who double breached right before our eyes. The line stayed in formation however, passing directly along the shorelines. The next line of resting whales was replete with lots of big fins- the younger boys were following suit and passed again, right on the shores. The show was not over, we had Cappuccino and Raggedy pass along with lots of K Pod whales, intermingled with L's- all right at the shoreline. One mother passed by holding her youngster above the water on her rostrum- lots of rolling and play in general. This was truly a once in a lifetime experience today.

Capt. Peter, Ashley and I spent the
afternoon
with "Spirit" and her boys today. A mother's love and authority are never in question and L22 gave a great demonstration of that. All was quiet and calm when we first arrived on scene.
L79
"Skana" was doing his own thing and
L22
"Spirit" was within sight, for us humans, but in her own space away from her son. They were moving at an exaggeratedly slow pace and "Skana" was above water for so long each time that he blew that we could see the small nick in the tip of his dorsal fin. The dives were long and there were some direction changes, but for the most part they seemed to be drifting with the currents. Rather suddenly though, "Skana" and "Spirit" changed direction and sped up. They moved in side-by-side and were definitely traveling northwest. As we motored along trying to keep up, we were surprised by another male orca that popped up right behind us. Nobody had seen him up until then. It was
L85
"Mystery". He quickly joined the others, but then there was another and another! Suddenly we were watching a family of 5
orcas
moving quickly through the waters on there way to somewhere important. It is of course unclear to those of us above water how the decision to change direction and speed was made, much less who made it. But once the word went out, all of the family responded. With our resident orcas living in a matriarchal society, it makes sense that "Spirit" is the one that decides the who, how, when and where. It may be more diplomatic than that, but the decision was obviously agreed upon and/or followed by all involved. We finally said goodbye to this proud family and wended our way back to Friday Harbor. Once at the dock we unloaded other proud families that had made many memories today as well as a connection with an intelligent and devoted species of the earth.
