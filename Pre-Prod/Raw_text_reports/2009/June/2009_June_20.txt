The day started off with a sighting of a
Gray whale
off
Point Roberts
Marina at
7 AM
. At

4:55 PM
the
orcas
were off
Point Roberts
heading north to their historic fishing grounds off the arms of the Fraser River.
Peter Hamilton, LifeForce, Pt. Roberts

At
Turn Point
the Prince of Whales zodiac met up with members of
J Pod
around
1pm
. The whales were so active with numerous breaches etc. They were slowly heading toward the Strait of Georgia. Several family groups were swimming together, however I never saw the tiny ones, J44 and J45. They must have been tucked in tight close to mom. I had never seen Ruffles, J1 breach before. His huge pectoral fins were impressive.
Marie, Orca-Magic, Prince of Whales

We received another report, from Fran Mandich of
Bush Pt
- they saw an active pod of
4 or 5 orcas
off Bush Pt. heading south quickly at

8:20 pm
.
*
T49A, T49A1 and T49A2
were skulking around between
Race Rocks
and Pedder Bay for most of the day.

J Pod
traveled north up
San Juan Island
, past Turn Pt. continuing to head north.
Ruffles J-1 and Granny J-2
were in the lead and they had company -
Spock K-20 and Comet K-38
! We saw LOTS of
orca
. These were all in the vicinity of
Stuart Island
, between

1:45 and
2:15 pm
. Photos submitted included shots of the
J14s
&
J16s

Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island

On the afternoon trip again,
J Pod plus K20 & K38
were observed crossing the
Strait of Georgia
from the East Point of Saturna Island to the Point Roberts/Tsawwassen area. It was one breach after another as the whales made the crossing, with some individuals repeating the behaviour up to 5 times in a row. One whale managed to get his entire body clear of the water by flicking his tail flukes to the side at the height of his breach!
Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch

On the
1630
Keystone to
Port Townsend
ferry, a
minke
whale was observed by myself and the ferry captain around
1645
. The whale was approximately 100 yards off the bow of the ferry. It was alone, heading west just north of Port Townsend Bay. I saw it surface three times.
Scott Hagerty, Port Townsend, WA

Had some of your
Southern Resident
friends come through Discovery Passage headed home! They might be a little skinnier as they had to run the Discovery treadmill, bucking a 7 knot ebb tide and moving through the water at bursts of 14-15 knots! We left them still travelling at
2030
hours in 3 distinct groups. We are guestamating 24-26 animals total.

Orcas
sighted off Whiskey Point,
Quadra Island BC
. between

20:10 and
20:40
(approximately: N 50 02' 10.4" / W 125 12' 55.3"). We believe 6 in one group and 9 in the second group, traveling south - toward Cape Mudge and the Strait of Georgia. They were simply swimming against the out tide. First group was reasonably close together. Second group would have been spread out almost in a line of about 200 meters. One very large male for sure in the second group.

Thanks to a call from a friend working at the
Tsawwassen ferry terminal
, we were able to have a long distance sighting of [
orcas
] between

5:30 and
6:30
. They traversed back and forth in front of the terminal a bit and then headed north. Very spread out. Some breaches. Spotted a couple of young ones.
