One
gray whale
in
Boundary Bay
today. It was actively foraging the entire time we were there - about 45 minutes. When we began to leave, very slowly making our way out of the area, the whale suddenly appeared alongside the boat, and then one more time before turning back to its foraging area. On
May 27, there were 5 grays in the bay - at least 3 of which had been there since mid-April. I think this whale is our final visitor for the season.

Gray whale
today at

2:20 pm
near
Whidbey Island Naval Base
. These whales have a streamlined body with a narrow, tapered head. Gray whales are always great to watch, we observed the whale foraging. We even saw the whales fluke. Gray whales are bottom sediment feeders. The whale exhibited the predictable breathing pattern. Gray whales are a mysticete or baleen whale and have two blow holes. Sometimes you can see a heart or v-shaped spray.

What a magnificent start to Orca Month with over
20 Transient Orcas
in the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
! During our afternoon tour we were incredibly fortunate to not only observe two Harbor Seal kills by the Transient Orcas but
a greeting ceremony
as two different groups met north of
Port Angeles
. We observed one dramatic kill in particular as a young Orca porpoised directly towards a harbor Seal and then exploded onto the poor unsuspecting Seal! Later as the two groups met we saw a number of tailslaps, Spyhops, pectoral waves and breaches, it was breathtaking to watch.

The call came -
3 miles N of Dungeness Spit
, which is near
Sequim
. One of the other captains announced that there was a seal to the port side of his boat. No sooner said, three female
orcas
headed toward the poor seal at top speed, porpoising through the water with blazing speed. The captain said he just saw the seal turn its head toward the onrushing Orcas about a second before he was gone. This all happened so quickly that I missed most of it with my camera but not the eyes. We left about

4:00 PM
and shortly after that the last boat on scene departed and the Ts were not to be found again yesterday evening.

Fred Rice, a visitor at the Klaloch Lodge in

2 orcas

gray whales
headed south, seen from shore at the lodge. One looked like a male.
