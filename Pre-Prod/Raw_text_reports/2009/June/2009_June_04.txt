Orca Sightings for June 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were thrilled to see a
pod of orcas
as we approached the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
at
1441
. We observed them for about an hour from a distance of 1/4 mile or so. Pictures are attached (see above). We were at 48° 03.3' and 124° 54.0' (west of Lake Ozette, ). It is estimated that there were 8 orcas, 3 of them adult males, traveling SE. There may well have been more than 8. As we sail to the Queen Charlotte Islands, along the west coast of Vancouver Island, and in September, back home to Oregon, we will send our observations of Orcas and other cetaceans.

My best guess for the last photo (shown here) is L41 with L77. It would make the best sense since we had them on
June 2nd headed that way.

I want to report that several
orcas
were spotted this morning before heading into the
Anacortes
ferry terminal (5-10 minutes out) in front of the
11:15 am ferry from FH to Anacortes. It was about

12:20 pm
.

Just wanted to inform you of
T14
(Pender) heading north mid
Strait of Georgia
between the
Powell River
ferry terminal and Savory Island in the
afternoon
.

Orca Network received a call from Tyler, a Canadian visiting the California Coast, reporting a sighting of at least
2 orcas
off the north end of Garrapata Beach, near
Big Sur, CA
at

11:30 am
. The orcas were about 1 mile offshore, they were first heading north, then turned south, then back north again.

I was rowing around the south end of Rat Island (near Indian Island across from
Port Townsend
) about 100 yards past the turn inside the green buoy. At very low tide I know it's about 20 or 30 feet deep there since I can sometimes see the eel grass. Anyway my right blade hit something and immediately thereafter a
Gray whale
blew briefly right under my port rigger - and then dived, brushing the bottom of my boat with its back or tail. I'm pretty sure the whale was as surprised as I was. Did the whale see me? I think not. After our encounter this morning the whale took off toward the Navy dock, and then circled back to swim parallel to my path and blew a couple of more times. It never did breach and I never really saw its body but I would guess it was at least 25 feet long and made quite a wake just below the surface as it swam away from me.

Grey whales
off the Nor'Wester building (
NAS Whidbbey
) again today. About 150 Yds off the shore. At least one good size Grey Whale that was actually rotating sideways such that we thought we were seeing an Orca fin at first! The Grey seems to be happily feeding.
