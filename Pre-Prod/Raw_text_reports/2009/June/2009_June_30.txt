Orca Sightings for June 30, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
was encountered just north of
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
(48째 31.298 N; 123째 09.804 W) spread out traveling south at

10:43 a.m
by Center for Whale Research staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah. Whales were spread from shore to mid strait. A lot of milling, foraging and surface activity was observed. The whales turned west off South Beach (48째 26.42 N; 123째 00.68 W) where the encounter ended at

2:03 p.m.
J's later turned around and headed back up island.

Orca Network received a message from Brenden Sams relaying a report of
orcas
in
Humboldt Co, CA
for the last 2 days. He left no details but said he had photos, we will forward on any further info. or photos as they come in.

We spent a delightful day with
J Pod
in the
afternoon and evening
. We left them headed north at

7:00 PM
at
Limekiln
, and later in the evening heard them near Mitchell Pt. on the northwest side of San Juan Island.

We got word that the
Orcas
were near
False Bay
and heading up island. We rushed over there and immediately were able to identify
J-1, "Ruffles"
, we then saw granny, Riptide, Sachi and a few others. We were so excited, J-pod twice in a row! It's always so amazing to see Granny; she is estimated to be 98 years old and the matriarch of J-pod. We watched J-pod as they cruised with the current toward
Lime Kiln State Park
. They traveled very close together for a while, and then spread out a little. On our afternoon adventure we saw J-30, Riptide, along with other J-pod members. Riptide was born in 1995 and is the eldest surviving offspring of J-14, Samish. He is maturing into an adult and is growing a very tall dorsal fin. We watched as he fished, very interesting, you can see how quickly he is capable of moving. We also saw lots and lots of spy hopping. On the way back to Friday Harbor on our afternoon trip we were looking at all the sea birds, mostly gulls, congregating in one spot on the ocean surface. This is a sure sign of 'fish'. The birds were making lots of noise and sure enough we saw a
Minke whale
. Minke whales are one of the smallest baleen whales. We watched for a few minutes and another minke surfaced, but this one was much smaller, one of the Captains named him "Twinkie". "Twinkie" the baby minke

We had word that
J Pod
was also down south of the island! The kids were thrilled when they got to witness
J1 Ruffles
just poking along about 1 mile offshore from
Lime Kiln
. We also watched J2 Granny just in front of Ruffles, and the kids got a laugh out of the fact that Ruffles is a big "momma's boy" who stays pretty close to her for most of his life. We left the whales around
1045
. For our afternoon trip, we went to visit the
orcas
again, who were doing the classic "west side shuffle" between
Lime Kiln and Eagle Point (1300)
. The whales were following the shoreline pretty closely, and as we watched from nearly 1/2 mile from shore, everyone aboard was asking great questions about whale behaviors. We had
J22 Oreo
and her boy
J34 Doublestuff
a bit further away from the main group, and they seemed to be doing some fishing based on their multiple direction changes. And then Doublestuff literally erupted from the water doing two huge breaches in a row. He sure is getting to be big at only 11 years of age! Then the group of inshore whales decided to follow his lead and did several breaches, tailslaps, and spyhops as well. We headed back down to Salmon Bank, as the kids were going to do an experiment collecting plankton. But imagine our surprise as we floated silently in the water while making the collection to have the same very small minke whale from yesterday surface very close to the boat! He must have been down on a long dive as we had last seen him over 800 yards away from the boat in his prior surfacing. One of the kids noted he must be eating some of the same stuff they were trying to collect! We watched for a few minutes longer as we watched the minke proceed to a baitball and scatter all the birds as he "stole" his meal from them.

10:30am
-
Resident orcas
observed from shore at Smallpox Bay on
San Juan Island
. Several male dorsal fins were visible, as well as open saddle patches, as the pod traveled Southbound. One orca exhibited two fluke slaps, and another changed direction for a short time. All continued South, and were again observed at Dead Man's Bay.

J Pod
heading north on the west side of
SJI
near
Hanna Heights
. There are whales coming in from the direction of Hein Bank, not sure if this is J Pod or others - details to follow!
