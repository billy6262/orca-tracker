Orca Sightings for June 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Neal Thomsen called today to report a sighting from 2 miles from shore at
Casper, CA
, just south of Ft. Bragg. He said at least
9 orcas
were harassing at least one seal. The party boat captain saw breaches from a distance and went to investigate. Three large males went south, leaving two juveniles and four others bashing and flinging the seal before letting it get back to the rocks.

Just to let you know that the
L12's, K20 and K38
went west early in the morning. So the (orca) sightings in Puget Sound must have been transients. Mark Malleson found the L12's, K20 and K38 at aprox

11:30 am
off Jordan River, B.C going west.

A report of a
humpback
whale sent us into the Strait of Juan de Fuca off of
Pile Point
from about

1:10pm to 2pm
during slack ebb tide. We watched the whale surfacing, taking 4 to 5 breaths, then diving from 4-6 minutes. The juvenile, about 40'? in length, seemed to be zig zagging as it was slowly working it's way west-northwest, as it would surface offshore, then the next surfacing would be inshore, repeating this transecting pattern. Only saw the flukes once, it showed the arching of it's body- the humped back- on every last surfacing before it dove! On our way out in the Strait we saw 2 groups of 3 Dall's Porpoise.

We watched a
Humpback
Whale off of the west side of
San Juan Island
today. It was just south of Hanbury Point slowly traveling west. It seemed to be a smaller animal and would take one or two breaths before going down for up to five minutes. There was only one deep dive that resulted in us being able to see the fluke. We were on site from

2:20 PM to
3:00 PM
.
