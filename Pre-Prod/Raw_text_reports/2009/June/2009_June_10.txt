Orca Sightings for June 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pod of
killer whales
off the
Oregon
coast. We first spotted them in Manzanita about 30 feet off the shore. They we're headed toward Short Sands.

From

1:15pm to
2:05pm
, we were delighted to watch
L-41, L-77, K-20, and K-38
, actively foraging off of
False Bay
. They headed west-northwest at first, then made directional changes and milling as the flood tide picked up. Lots of percussive behaviors- tail slaps, pectoral slaps, and breaches! L-41 was upside down, repeatedly slapping his curled tail flukes back on the surface! Nice to see the K's with the L's, and familiar behavior- hope they got some salmon.

Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster, Erin Heydenreich, John Durban and Leigh Hickmott of the Center for Whale Research headed out after receiving a report of the
L12's off Hein Bank
from Jeanne Hyde at
6 a.m.
At

9:48 a.m.
L85
was spotted off
Salmon Bank
(48째 25.958 N; 123째 00.629 W) traveling slowly towards San Juan Island (48째 27.93 N; 123째 00.84 W). The whales were very spread out and apparently foraging. The whales present were: L12, L25, L41, L77, L94, L79, L85, L89, L22, K20, K38. All whales that were in the area were documented. This is the first sighting of any L pod whales since March, and the second CWR encounter with L's in Puget Sound this year.

Great day on the water with
L12's and K20 and K38
off the bottom end of
San Juan
.
On my way home (from San Juan Isl) I came across the
T10's and 2 other female transients
cruising north along the west side of Halibut Island in
Haro Strait
. We left them just north of Mandarte Island still traveling north.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research had a brief encounter with
Transient orcas T87, T88 and T97
off the
Victoria
waterfront. Also, we had a report yesterday from Mark Malleson about
T10's off Mandarte Island
and
T21's down south
, but neither report is confirmed at the moment.

K38
was jumping a lot today. He seemed much happier to have other Orcas around.
It's a boy!
I'm so proud! (Big tears welling in eyes.) The photos I took today are the first of the underside of K38.

The
two K's and L12s
started off at

5:12 am
off west San Juan Island - headed north, turned, headed south---and have been doing the shuffle ALL DAY LONG, all day
between South Beach and Landbank
- I dont even think they have made it to Lime Kiln yet. Up down, up down -- CLASSIC.

The
3.30pm
Ocean Magic encountered some of
L pod orca
this afternoon off
San Juan Island
. We found 'Mega', L 41 and 'Alexis, L 12, foraging 1-2 miles offshore from other members of this family group. We watched for a while and then moved closer to shore where we watched L 77 'Matia' and two others that I weren't able to identify, as they were far off. They were all heading North. I did hear that K 20 and K38 had joined this group so perhaps those two seen very close to shore were the K's.
As if that wasn't magic enough (see above report), on the way back we sighted two more
Orca
off Seabird Lighthouse, Discovery Island, and they turned out to be
T20 and T21
. We only saw them once and then they disappeared.

Southern Resident
Killer Whales
on the west side of
San Juan Island
. We identified members of
L-pod
. We first saw some members of L-pod just south of
Lime Kiln State Park
heading North. Just as we decided to make a trip around San Juan Island following the orcas, they changed their direction and began heading South. We quickly changed our direction and began heading south as well. We watched as the orcas traveled and even spy hopped.
