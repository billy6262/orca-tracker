Orcas
off the
central oregon coast
- around

7:30 p.m
. my boyfriend and I were sitting in our hot tub over looking
Otter Rock
watching
a grey whale
and some sea lions close to the beach when further off shore, just west of Bird Rock we spotted fins and ran to get the binoculars. I was certain they were Orcas because the fins were just too large to be porpoises. We figured we would watch them as they continued to travel north and that would be it -- but the excitement was just beginning. Three adults and one baby Orca came right into shore so we jumped out of the hot tub and drove down the street to the point over looking Devils punchbowl to get a closer look. They were so close we did not need our binoculars. They were breaching over and over again! We were the only people out there on the head land to see this until we phoned one neighbor, then the word got out and within 10 minutes half the neighborhood showed up! A group of three sea lions began swimming south from the marine gardens and were headed straight toward the Orcas! When the sea lions discovered the trouble they were in all three jumped out the water and dove toward the rocks. We couldn't figure out if all this breaching, rolling and tail slapping was some kind of ritual, play, mating or feeding?? Still unsure if they had a sea lion under water that they were feeding on or if the sea lions got away? The pod finally said goodbye and continued on their journey North about

8:30 p.m.

Early in the day we had reports of
K20 & K38
inbound. We saw the whales several miles east of
Dungeness
at
1330
. The mother/calf pair were moving at a fairly good clip, with K38 sometimes ahead of mom, sometimes behind. Both appeared to be in good health and moving well. While we have seen matrilines sometimes "do their own thing", this is the first time I've seen a mother/calf separate from the other 4 members of her matriline (especially this pair). We last saw Spock & Comet heading
east
at
1420
.

K20 Spock and her calf K38 Comet
were just off the
Dungeness Spit
. It was a little eerie seeing them out there all alone.

I heard that the lonesome twosome (
K20 & K38
) were at
Partridge Pt
. headed SE at about

5:30 this evening

Orcas
by
Ebey's Landing
(W-Central Whidbey Island) at

4:30 pm
- might be more whale watch boats (4) than orcas, hard to tell, slowly moving
south
.

Today we made the long trip across the Strait of Juan de Fuca (it was calm and beautiful!), to see
K-20 and K-38
off of
Ediz Hook
from about

2:15 to
2:30pm
. They were traveling
southeast
with the flooding tide at a fair pace. In my 12 years of observing the SRKW community, I have not seen just 2 whales without the rest of their family, pod, or other community members reportedly in the general area!?

1900-2030
pst. Pod of
4 orca
. One large dorsal, 3 smaller. Viewed from Devils Punchbowl State Park,
Otter Rock, OR.
10 miles north of Newport, OR. Full breaches, tail slapping, for about 30 minutes. Moved north towards Cape Foulweather and Depoe Bay. Probably feeding on Otter Rock resident harbor seals. Very few gray calves have been spotted yet. The grays usually begin to be abundant around June/July close to the Otter Rock shoreline. We usually see one or two lone transients here. Having this pod display, and so close to shore, is a rare treat.
