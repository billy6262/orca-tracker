Orca Sightings for June 27, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a
gray whale
swim under our sailboat and surface right next to us (yikes, what a surprise!) as we were headed back to Everett Marina. Here are the details: 1 Gray Whale, just north of the green shallow water buoy that is west of
Everett Marina
traveling WNW, towards Whidbey Island, around
6pm
. Traveling, surfacing for air every couple of minutes.

Howard did a talk at NAS Whidbey Island, and was told the
2 Gray whales
had been observed that
morning
off
NAS Whidbey
, where they have been present for three months (between West Beach/NAS Whidbey) - will be interesting to see how long they stay!

The Ocean Magic II caught up with
J Pod
just after

13:00
as they came around the SE point of
Lopez Island
heading West. They were quite spread out and appeared to be foraging. Our later trip found them South of San Juan Island, very active, with lots of splashing and breaching. They then grouped up and we had some great passes by the whole family! It was great to see both new calves looking very healthy. I happened to click the shutter at the right time and got a fantastic shot of Granny, Ruffles, and (I am assuming) J45, Granny's great-grandson! We left them at

17:30
at Middle Bank, still West-bound.

J Pod
was off
Eagle Point
, San Juan this afternoon, around
4.30pm
. They were seen gathering speed as they headed west. In choppy water we watched the individual families file past with spyhops, tail slaps, and breaches, bucking a flood tide. It was awesome to watch them as they surfaced. We got to see individual faces above the waves for a change. The tiny ones looked like they were doing well.

1930
: Likely
J pod
well spread out and moving northward. Few vocals though some great S-4 calls (that neat growl) and some echolocation clicks.
Val Veirs, San Juan Island

Tom Reeve of Lopez Island called to report a pod of
~15+ orcas
was off S. Lopez Island, heading east to west toward
Iceberg Pt
at

1:30 pm
.
*
Nadia Baker called at

11:30 am
to report a pod of
orcas
was heading south from Bellingham Channel, toward where they were kayaking off S. Lopez Island. At

1:25 pm
she reported the whales had nearly reached
Iceberg Pt
, S Lopez Isl.
*
Nadja Baker called at

1:25 pm
to report a
Minke whale
about 1/4 mile south of
Iceberg Pt
, S. Lopez Island.
*
A couple of friends of mine who were out flying today spotted a
Gray Whale
NW of
Everett
at

10:30 AM
. It was feeding in the shallows on the shoals.

Orca Network received a report of 1 whale observed east of Possession Beach (
SW Whidbey Isl
) in Possession Sound (probably about 1 mile from shore). Traveling south,

5:15AM
. Looks like he had somewhere to go. He was heading south pretty quick. He'd surface about every minute and let out a good blow his tail would flop and then go back under. There was a fin on the back, but it wasn't especially big.
From this description, it sounds like it was
possibly a humpback whale
- Grays don't have a dorsal fin, and Minke whales don't have a conspicuous spout and typically don't show their flukes when diving.
