Orca Sightings for June 18, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Once at the
naval air station
, Whidbey Island we watched two
Gray Whales
feeding in 20'-40' of water. One was definitely a larger adult with the second one most likely being a juvenile. They would take several breaths and then dive for 2-3 minutes. They were moving in generally a southward direction. As we were leaving for our sunset trip we came upon a
Minke Whale
in the mouth of Friday Harbor. It slowly circled the boat in a feeding pattern. It was taking single breaths and then diving for approximately 2 minutes.

Jim Maya of Maya's Westside Charters called to report
J pod, the L12s and K20 & K38
looking happy in
Race Passage
at approx.

7:10 pm
. They had been spotted earlier in the day off Jordon River, S. Vancouver Island, heading east.

We saw members of
J Pod
, members of the
L-12s
subgroup, and we saw Spock

I am writing to report that we saw
3 Orca's
while running back from Heceta Banks towards
Newport, OR
at approximately
11 am
. I did not record the lat and lon, but we were approximately 2 miles S x SW of the southern tip of Stonewall Banks. The Orca's were travelling nearly due South in tight formation with what appeared to be 2 adults and 1 juvenile or calf. I am not positive if there was a male as the fins on the adults appeared to be close to the same length. The water at that point was about 58 degree's and smooth.

Mary Jo Adams reported seeing
2 gray whales
again off
Moran Beach, NW Whidbey Island
early Thursday
afternoon
.

We went to Whidbey Island to see not one, but
two gray whales
. We think one appeared to be a bit larger than the other. It was a great show. Gray whales are amazing animals.

I spotted a
Minke
whale off the bow of our whale watching boat coming out of
Friday Harbor
, San Juan Island. The naturalist as well as the captain of the boat said they had never seen a Minke that close to the harbor before. We saw the whale surface the water about 3-4 times in about 5 minutes before it dove for a longer period of time.
