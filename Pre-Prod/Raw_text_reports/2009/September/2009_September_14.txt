Orca Sightings for September 14, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

2:10pm
, as we headed into the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
we could see
killer whales
swimming fast from San Juan Island toward the southeast. L-41 Mega and sister L-77 Matia slowed down and began sweeping Salmon Bank in a classic foraging pattern. So quiet we heard the buoy bell and orcas breathing. Sister L- 94 Calypso worked near shore before joining her siblings. All three turned back northwest and began aggressively fishing, glad to see L-41 with a fish in his mouth! A wondrous stream of L and K vocals and clicks, nonstop for about 20 minutes! (Were L-41 & L-77 putting out the call- there's fish here?!) More L's and K's headed from Eagle Cove and out about a ½ mile, including L-72 Racer with son L-105 Fluke, K-40 Raggedy with brother K-21 Cappuccino, fishing the bank, a few breaches, spy hops, tail lobs, and cartwheels, when we had to head home at
3:34pm.

Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Astrid van Ginnekin and Stefan Jacobs encountered
J's, K's and L's
spread out in
Boundary Pass
(48° 43.499 N, 123° 08.050 W) at

3:12 p.m
. They were traveling in loose groups toward Turn Point. We observed J44 rolling over and were able to confirm that he is a male. The encounter ended at
6:25 off Open Bay (48° 34.982 N, 123° 11.683 W). The whales had picked up speed and were traveling steadily south.

The Center for Whale Research received a report of
10 to 12 transients
off East Point on Saturna Island B.C. at

1:45 p.m
. We quickly departed, but by the time we arrived at the location of the last sighting, the transients were reportedly already several miles north of East Point.

Erica called to report a sighting of
orcas
between
Point No Point
(N. Kitsap Peninsula) and
Whidbey Island
. Between

4:15 and 5 pm
they observed first 1 lone orca with a tall skinny fin, then later another small pod of orcas off Maxwelton beach, mid-channel. The orcas were heading north.
We sent the photos of the orcas off Whidbey Island Sept, 14 to the Center for Whale Research, and received this ID from Dave Ellifrit: Looks like the (transient orcas) T30's.

I am sending you photos of the orcas who have been visiting Olympia lately. KIm says she saw them in front of her house (across from Cooper Point, I think Ralph told me for five mornings.

And this morning, at

4:30
, we were awakened by a pounding sound. I GOT UP AND DISCOVERED IT WAS THE POD OF
ORCAS
, SLIGHTLY OFF
COOPER POINT
, FROLICKING, FLUKE FLAPPING, BREACHING, BLOWING, AND EVEN AN AUDIBLE VOCALIZATION I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE. THEY LEFT THE INLET DOING ALL THAT ACTIVITY THE ENTIRE WAY. THEY HEADED TO
HUNTER POINT
AT

5:00 a.m
.

This is day five (in a row) for our visiting
transient orcas
. Don't know the pod. They have been coming earlier each morning. The first three mornings we only saw them as they were leaving Eld Inlet. The last two mornings we've seen them come in and then go out again. It was quite dark at
6:00 this morning - but Scott got up to watch the sunrise. It was totally calm. Then he heard them. Then he saw them. It was breathtaking to witness the calm of the bay with only the surfacing of the whales and the ripples they left behind. These photos happened as they were starting to leave from
Sanderson Cove
area south of us (which is all the further down the Inlet they went this morning) and were heading back out toward Dana Passage.

My cousin and I were at his house in
Steilacoom
when we saw 3 possibly 4
Orca
whales aprox
5 pm
. They were between Ketron Island and Steilacoom and were playing and blowing for about 10 minutes before disappearing off the north side of Ketron Island. Today we spotted them again from Steilacoom just off the north side of Ketron Island. They were blowing and up and down for aprox 20 minutes and finally moved around and we could no longer see them as they moved to the northwest side of Ketron Island. The time of the sightings today was aprox

4:05-
4:25 pm
.

I was watching some
L-Pod
whales head south from shore near
False Bay
at about

2:45 PM
when I spotted a blow that was way too big to be an orca. It turned out to be from a
humpback
whale! There were actually
three humpbacks
in the group, and they were heading north up
Haro Strait
. I saw them again from Land Bank at about
3:15 and they were probably about 2 miles offshore when I left at
3:30.

Three
humpback
whales off of
Hannah Heights
at
1430
. Two adults and possibly one juvenile slowly feeding along the coastline. Our last view was of double flukes sliding into the water.

We saw orcas for about 45 minutes between the west side of the southern end of
Whidbey Island and Point No Point
, in the middle of the channel. It was
4.15pm
when we spotted them, and 5pm when we headed south again and left them. At one point we briefly glimpsed a group of perhaps
8-10 whales
, (alas no photo), but most of the time we observed a small group of 3 (see photo). From my rudimentary knowledge I am assuming this group was one male, and 2 female (or juvenile) orcas. They were very gradually going north and seemed to be in feeding mode, i.e. there were deep dives for 5 minutes or so followed by 2 or 3 surface breaths, then deep dives again. This little group stayed close together for the 30 minutes or so we observed them. When we left them they were off Maxwelton beach, still in the middle of the channel.

K and L pod orcas
were traveling down island (west
San Juan Isl
). We met them at False Bay and traveled with them until south beach where they moved offshore for ~1 mile and then turned southeast. K21, L41, L72, L105 and L26 were some of the animals present. As they moved offshore they grouped together and headed across the strait in 3-4 groups. There was also a
minke whale
traveling along with them. It had been feeding in the current lines, but changed it's direction when the orcas arrived in it's area. 15 or more Steller's sea lions on Whale Rocks with one female mixed in with all of the large males.
