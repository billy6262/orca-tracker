Orca Sightings for September 19, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
The south sound
transients
came by our cabin just south of Vaugn Bay on
Case Inlet
again at the same time of day as we saw them over Labor Day weekend, almost exactly
3 p.m.
(there seems to be a pattern here.) This time they were only about 200 yards off shore, and were headed south again. They entertained us for about 10 minutes as they passed by, with 3 great spy hops and a couple of full breaches.
