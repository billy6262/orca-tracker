I thought I would share pictures of a number of incredible
Humpback Whale
encounters off
Victoria
between Sept 23rd and Sept 25th. Over the last few weeks we have been consistently seeing Humpback Whales off Victoria but the last three days we have had some amazing encounters with up to six Humpback Whales in the area between Constance Bank and Race Rocks! These encounters have included tail slaps, tail lobs, kelping, spyhops, some breathtaking cartwheels and even breaching. Over the last few days I have witnessed some of the most wonderful Humpback Whale encounters of my career as a Marine Naturalist and all on the door step of Victoria:) Regards,
Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching

We headed out from Snug Harbor and out into
active pass
. The breaches and Ruffles were on the way there and the one with the BC Ferry was at the mouth of active pass. Boy did the
orca
go nuts when they got to that entry.

I would like to report a brief
Minke Whale
sighting. This occurred at about

1:45 PM
, I spotted a Minke surfacing at a distance on a lovely sunny fall afternoon in
Admiralty Inlet
just north of the Keystone to Port Townsend Ferry route. The whale was crossing the inlet from west to east, heading towards the cliffs of Whidbey.
