Orca Sightings for September 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a return trip from Victoria B.C.,
J's, K's, L7 and L53
were encountered off
Trial Island
at

10:44 a.m
. by Center for Whale Research's Ken Balcomb, Marjoleine Roos, and Helen. The whales were spread out in mixed groups traveling north east. The encounter ended at

12:03 p.m.
off Beaumont Shoal.

About half of
J-Pod
heading north toward
Henry Island
, with a light flooding tide, from

2:12pm to
3:15pm
. J-8 Spieden still makes her distinctive sounding blow; she passed with J-28 Polaris and J-33 Keet. J-1 Ruffles at the end of the groups, slowly making his way north, then he turned and headed back south. All the whales that had made Henry Island turned and followed J-1's lead back south. J-17 Princess Angeline with J-44 were now the trailers and began porpoising to catch up! Little J-44 kept right up with Mom, leaping to clear the wake they were leaving! Harbor Porpoise, Dall's Porpoise, Harbor Seals, and a Steller Sea Loin, all in Haro Strait off of Henry Island, made for a stellar September outing!

Just an observation, now that another report of J's killing a porpoise has surfaced. While watching Ruffles, from the bluff of Westside Reserve, and several others from
J-pod
heading toward
Hannah Heights
, I saw distant splashing and leaping of propoises off the Heights to the south. There were several small boats and a large cruiser (which was way too close), near a group of Orcas, including, possibly Kari Koski in an inflatable, observing the behavior. It looked like the orcas were right in there with the porpoise. I was startled to see both species that close together. It did appear the porpoises were trying to flee the orcas. I was too far away to confirm what I observed. If, indeed the report of J-pod killing a porpoise is true I may have seen it happening, tho' from quite a distance away.

We caught up with the [
orcas
] along the northwest side of
San Juan Island
and traveled back and forth with them from there and Kellet Bluff. The whales traveled back and forth, many were along the shorelines, and a few were offshore. We had some great views of J1 & likely J22. We also some some porpoising and apparent fishing action from J14 and her calf J44.

We sped up to meet the
Orcas
heading eastbound across
Haro Strait
, presumably from Beaumont Shoals. The first group encountered were the J2's, and they appeared to be headed directly for the shorline of
SJI
north of Pile Point. A little further to the south, we encountered the J16 matriline, and they appeared to be foraging along the shore. We heard that there may be T's just a little further to the south, and on our way to that point, we spotted J17 having a little one on one playtime with J44. There appeared to be alot of nudging by mom from below and plenty of tail waves from J44. Unfortunately, a full underside view of J44 was never seen, but alot of upside-down swimming was observed. (photo of J44 right-side-up attached - photo zoomed & cropped). After observing this oh-so- intimate moment between mom & calf, we headed off to see the reported T's - which turned out to be more of J Pod. They were mistaken for T's because they had been observed chasing a Dall's porpoise. In the area were J27, J31 and J39, plus a few others a little further in the distance, near the research vessel Phocoena.

I'm still processing my wonderful whale encounters at
Lime Kiln
area. I arrived at Lime Kiln Park at just the right timing, about

2:30 p.m
. I saw one fin while driving and so rushed down to waterfront. The first large female
Orca
meandered by slowly. Then bit by bit, groups of SR's, a few at a time appeared, heading North. Some far out, and some CLOSE IN giving a very WONDERFUL SHOW . Elated and whooping it up from the cliff side rocks, and with lots of people at the Park, and Hydrophone with loud frenzied ORCA talk playing for us at the Lighthouse, MANY (10?) Orcas came in close, slow passing. One Mother and baby duo. lots of females and some HUGE males. They were interested in us , one male spy hopped very close to check us out. The crowd was reeling! Behaviors: A few tail and Pec slaps, lolling, mostly just slow up and downs of groups of fins. About a 20 min show.Then the whales turned around and headed South!!! slow, some out, some into shore, slow meandering, lolling. Another 15 minutes. The best yet was a personal encounter: After all whales had passed, I drove South and parked before getting to Dead Man Bay. Walked down to Shore cliffs. About
3:40 p.m., I noticed another group of 5 whales Southbound toward me from Lime Kiln. I waited alone at water's edge. They came along shore toward me and I hollered and praised them and they swam VERY close to where I was. Passing slowly by, bringing up the rear of all the other whales that had passed, it was Ruffles, Granny (nick on fin?) and some other females. I Greeted and waved at Ruffles when he surfaced and then, he went back down with a lift of his tail. One of the females did the same. I felt that they had waved at me. I'm Honored to tell it!

I am listening to the
Hydrophone
at
Lime Kiln Point
and am currently hearing whales. It started at

1:17
, a gap for 2 minutes and then again at

1:19 -
1:23pm after which the sounds (clicking and squeaks) are much further apart and appear to be gone by
1:27 pm.

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called to relay a 2nd hand report of the
Transient
orca pod off Piner Pt, S. Maury Island at

11:07 am
, heading south. She didn't hear about the orcas until mid- afternoon, but headed out to try to spot them, and at

5:45 pm
found them still off
Maury Island
, and at
6:30 pm they were heading south past Maury Marine Park, where they milled for 40 minutes and continued slowly south along Maury Island until she lost sight of them around
7:30 pm.
