Orca Sightings for September 1, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Greg Schorr and I conducted our monthly outer coast survey from Westport Tuesday. It was a slow day on the whale front, although heavy fog for almost half the day probably had something to do with that. We saw only two
humpbacks
, but we did encounter a good diversity of small odontocetes. We ran into a small group of
Risso's
dolphins twice, only our second sighting of this species during almost five years of these surveys. We also saw
Dall's and harbor porpoise
, and had a beautiful encounter with several hundred
northern right whale dolphins
with up to hundred or so
pacific white-sided dolphins
interspersed. The weather, the size of the group, and their surface active and boat-friendly behavior made for the best encounter either of us have ever had with northern right whale dolphins, and we came back with some beautiful picture of these unusual animals.

Orca Network received a call from Kevin, a NOAA fisheries groundfish observer, who reported seeing
1 orca
with a 3' tall dorsal fin off the mouth of the
Noyo River
heading south, near
Ft. Bragg, CA
at

11:39 am
. The location was 39 39 37N, 124 01 02W.

I first spotted a large group of
orcas
out in the
Strait of Georgia
, well off to the northeast of East Point, Saturna Island around

11:30am.
There were two whale boats on the scene, and lots of breaching and tail lobbing going on. As the tide was turning to flood against them, it would take them about an hour and a half to reach the shelf between Boiling Reef and Patos Island, by which time they had spread out into three groups extending along that line about a mile end to end. By

1:15pm
they were passing
East Point
heading southwest, with numerous J's and L's passing very close to shore including J16, J17 with a calf, J19, L27 with a calf, L47, L86 and L106. With now at least 40+ whales spread out in Boundary Pass, it became very congested with whale boats, private motor and sailboats and quite a few large ships -- at one point a container ship passed right over a group of whales and at least two could be seen surfing the wake as it passed, porpoising, tail lobbing and breaching in the waves. The current, now at it's peak, slowed the pods to a crawl, and it wasn't until around
3:15pm that they reached Skipjack Island. They seemed to linger about there for a while, making little progress, and didn't really start moving again until around
3:45. They reached Taylor Point on Saturna Island around
4:15pm at which point I lost sight of them. The Center for Whale Research poop patrol was in action and spent at least a couple of hours in their search for specimens -- I didn't see if they scored any samples.

We saw a pod of [
orcas
] just off Flapjack point yesterday. This is extremely far south on Puget Sound, and we've never seen whales in this area before. Here are the details:
Location: Approximately 50 yards off Flapjack Point on Eld Inlet near
Olympia
, Washington. Time of sighting:

12:30 - 12: 40 pm
.
Number of whales: Definitely three whales and possibly four. Appeared to be two adults, one youth and one calf. At least one of the adults might have been a male because one of the dorsal fins appeared quite large.
Type of whales: We think they are Orcas. The photos don't show any white, but we could definitely see white multiple times as they swam in the water.
Direction: Whales came from the north and swam about 1/8 mile southward past the tip of Flapjack Point. Then they turned around and went back north. We never saw them again. We assume they were feeding since there are lots of seals in the bay this time of year. You could see the pod on the surface blowing water from their blow holes, they'd disappear under the water for about 2 minutes, and then appear again, swimming in unison.
