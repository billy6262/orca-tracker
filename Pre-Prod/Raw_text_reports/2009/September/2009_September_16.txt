J and K Pods
were located late this rainy
morning
just south of
Point Roberts
, heading southeast towards Cherry Point. The first whales encountered were a group of youngsters, with J28 (Polaris) being the oldest whale present. There appeared to be alot of play going on, with J34 (Doublestuff) being particularly playful, doing much swimming upside down and rolling around the others. The rest of J Pod and K Pod were spread out over miles, doing long dives and presumably foraging. Eventually the whales grouped up and started heading south towards Lummi Island. For a short period, they were porpoising in groups of up to 6 to 8 individuals. When the whales slowed down, the sun was just peaking out and they seemed to respond with multiple spyhops, some breaches and more socializing. We left the whales still heading southbound from
Alden Bank
at about
1 PM
.

We first arrived on scene and everyone was saying it was just
J's and K's
but after taking some pictures we noticed
L's
were there as well! Whales were everywhere! There were very few boats around which made it such a unique day, definitely unforgettable!
