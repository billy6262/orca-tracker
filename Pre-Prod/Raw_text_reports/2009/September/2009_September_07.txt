Orca Sightings for September 7, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mid
afternoon
, [
orcas
] passing
Lime Kiln
, going north. Most were too far offshore to even see, but a small group (the trailers) were within the 1/4 mile. Rumor had it that J and K pods were coming up island, so it was surprising to see that it was Nugget L-55, and her three kids: Kastaka L-82, Lapis L-103 and youngest Takoda L- 109. I posted pics of them on my
blog
.

We saw about 8 or so [
orcas
] around
10-
10:15
Monday morning. They were about a mile offshore
West Beach Rd
, Whidbey Island and a mile north of Libey Rd (Pt Partridge). They then headed further out to the NW, maybe towards Rosario Strait (?). The Pt Townsend based whale watching boat was stopped right off shore here too, with the whales nearby. They got an early treat, usually it's quite a haul from Pt T out to the San Juan's.

K's and L's?
spread out in ones and twos, from Edwards Point into
Haro Strait
, traveling north with the flooding tide from

2:50pm to
3:30pm
. Many commercial and private fishing vessels- most I've seen in years. The air was filled with the smell of fish! Sighted 4 Dall's Porpoise heading southeast.

We were on our way to see the residents along San Juan Island but got reports of some transients along
Gabriola Island
. We found
8 transients
and were surprised to find them very active with breaches, tail slaps, high speed swimming and spyhops. We never saw any signs of a kill but some very fast swimming close to shore with seals on the rocks so there might have been one. I managed to ID T102, T124D and who i thought was T100D.

Jeff LaMarche of SeaFun Safaris called to report
K pod with J27
and a couple of
L pod
whales off west
San Juan Island
around
5 pm
. The rest of
Js and most of L pod
were 4 miles west of
Sombrio
, east of Port Renfrew, heading west at

5:10 ish
.
*
Finally got out on my little boat after hearing that
j-pod
was near
port townsend
, then nw of
smith Island
. got out and to the south end of sji and found about 5 orcas in and amongst the myriad of private and commercial fishing boats at about
1pm
. there were several whale watch boats on scene as the group split up - one heading back toward smith island and the other pair turned north along sji. I sort of followed north, but got outrun by the larger group of reported J's and K's making it to the park (
Lime Kiln
) by about
3pm
. I found myself among dozens of
dalls porpoise
, and soon after, I had at least
5 pacific white-sided dolphins
frisking about my bow as I drifted just after 3pm. they raced around under and surfaced many times for a few minutes and then vanished into the blue. I headed home toward anacortes and spotted a
minke
in the distance surface only once. this was 1 1/2 mile south of
iceberg point
, lopez Isl.

Orca Network received a report from Al Luneman of Coupeville, of a pod of
6 - 8 orcas
1 mile off
Ebey's Landing
, W. Coupeville, Whidbey Isl, with another larger pod further out in Admiralty Inlet heading NW toward Pt. Partridge at

9:48 am
.
*
Around

11:45 AM
we spotted them from
Langley
near Camano Head and heading in a SE direction. They were moving along at a fairly good pace occasionally changing direction and out of site by

12:20
. At

1:30 PM
we spotted them from our plane 1/2 mile south of the Clinton ferry heading towards Possession Point. After we landed I drove down to
Possession Point Park
and watched them pass a ways off shore at

2:20-
2:30 PM
. There was some occasional tail slapping, two spy hops, and swimming right along with all of the boat traffic. From the air we could clearly see that there were 5 orcas. It was more difficult to tell from shore.
Veronica von Allworden, Langley, Whidbey Island
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research has confirmed the pod off Whidbey Island Sept. 6 - 7 was the same pod of Transients that had been down in south Puget Sound earlier in the week - the T137s with T36A & T36A1.
*
Orca Network received a report of
orcas
in Saratoga Passage, 1 mile south of Elger Bay at

8:46 am
, but no direction of travel was given. Then we received the report below, so headed south to Langley. We first found the pod at

11:40
am from the shore at
Bell's Beach
, they were between Langley and Camano Head, milling amongst the many boats in the area. Then they headed toward Langley, so we went south, and found them again at

12:10 pm
, just heading around
Sandy Pt
. We clearly were able to count 5 fins surfacing several times, as they headed south into Possession Sound. From

1:15 -
1:30 pm we watched from the Clinton shoreline, as the orcas were actively jumping and likely feeding, between the Mukilteo Lighthouse & the Clinton Ferry Landing, then they headed on south down Possession Sound.
Looking at Veronica's photos, and the timeline of reports from Olympia, to Seattle, to S. Whidbey, we are certain these are the 5 Transient orcas observed in South Puget Sound Aug. 31 - Sept. 5 - the T137s, T36A & 36A1 - sb.b>

This morning in Saratoga passage from our home on Camano Island at
Mabana Beach
, we saw
3-4 Orca Whales
closer to Whidbey Island (but several miles north of Langley). They were traveling both north and south in what appeared to be circles, playing, jumping, tail splashing, and possibly feeding. There are clearly fish jumping out there, but we are unsure what type of fish. We spotted them beginning at around

9:15am
and are continuing to watch them at this time (
10:18 am). There is one Orca in the group that appears to be smaller than the rest of them. We are CERTAIN there are three, but fairly sure there are actually four of them altogether.

Jeff LaMarche of SeaFun Safaris reported 2
Humpbacks
2 miles south of
Jordon River
, S. Vancouver Island at around

5:10 pm
, heading west. At approx.
6 pm
, he called to report 1
Gray whale
heading west at
SanSimon Pt
.

Lone
minke
whale ~ 1-2 miles behind the previous groups of orcas also slowly moving north toward Pt. Partridge ~ 1 mile out off
Ebey's Landing
, west Whidbey Island.
