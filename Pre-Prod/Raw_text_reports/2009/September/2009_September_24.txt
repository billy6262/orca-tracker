Orca Sightings for September 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was walking in the
evening
at Chambers Bay golf course, University Place, near Tacoma. Several
Killer Whales
were feeding off shore. They then put on a pretty good "show". Breaching, and leaping clear of the water. Quite a site! I did not see where they came from. They appeared to be feeding for awhile. Around sunset they started breaching and then flat out clearing the water. I wouldn't know how to categorize this behavior other than they seemed to be having a pretty good time. There were at least three individuals.
