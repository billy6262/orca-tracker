Orca Sightings for September 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Now I'd never think of
Prince Rupert
as a place to go whale watching, but we were walking along the docks today and saw a hand-written sign that said "whale watching at 1 pm". So of course I checked - we had 20 mins to decide and of course we went along. WOW! We watched
humpbacks
bubble feed for well over an hour - we finally left them to go to another area, and found a few more doing some casual breaches, another just "resting", and a couple more moms and calves.

At about

6:30 pm
we saw a group of 5, possibly
Orcas
, swimming past our house. 4 (including a smaller one). Surfaced in unison several time with very adible blowing, before staying under for several minutes. There was a 5th with was near by, but always separate. We believe we saw a bit of white or light grey on the otherwise black body. They were not Dolphins or Porpoises.

Definitely sounds like the pod of Transient orcas - sb

A
grey whale
calf spotted at the
Keystone Ferry dock
at about

1:30pm
. It was all alone, no escort, no mother to be seen. It came very close to the docked ferry (before we departed), spouted, swam very close to shore in probably 20' of water and circled back out the entrance heading north.

Grey whale

Ebey's Landing
and Pt. Partridge - feeding for ~ 1/2 hour and now slowly moving north ~ 1/2mile out.

: No vocals on hydrophone. Lots and lots of
blows
coming to shore in the black calm night,
NW San Juan Island
. No movement, direction discernible. Blows coming from north, south and center!

Most of the southern resident
orcas
came past
Saturna Island
today, in two groups, going in opposite directions. 15-20
L's and K's
passed East Point headed northeast in
Boundary Pass
at about

1:45pm
. The group included L25,L26,L41,L54,L77,L78,L94,L108 and K21. They headed out into the Strait of Georgia bound for Point Roberts. About two hours later, a group of 40 - 50 orcas came out of the Strait of Georgia, headed southwest into Boundary Pass, and spent about three hours travelling from Patos Island to Monarch head, where I lost sight of them at about
7pm
. The second group travelled in two sub-groups the whole way, but were too far out in Boundary Pass for any positive ID's. For much of the transit, they appeared to be in resting mode, surfacing together and travelling very tighly.

This
morning
on the Western Explorer we up with part of
K-Pod
and part of
L-Pod
heading northeast up
Boundary Pass
at about
noon
. Present were the L2s, the L5s, part of the L12s (L41, L77, L94, L25), and K21 and K40. Right when we got on scene four of the whales surfed in a freighter wake, sharking and porpoising through the huge swells. K21 and L41 did it again on a second freighter wake right before we left. It was pretty darn impressive to see those whales cruising the waves just under the surface at about 25 knots! We also saw K21, L73, and L84 all swimming together, rolling around at the surface. Interestingly enough, there were some "sea snakes" involved in the play behavior of those three males, too! The Ks and Ls we were with this morning continued north and met with the other group of whales that was heading down front Point Roberts (Js, and the rest of Ks and Ls). By the time our
afternoon
Western Explorer trip got off the dock all three pods had met up and we came upon them at about 4 PM a few miles northeast of East Point. The superpod was spread out in several large groups and with the calm skies and seas we could really hear their blows. They were slowly heading back towards
Boundary Pass
but really weren't in any hurry at all. I was having trouble IDing individual whales out there, and when I came home and looked at my photos I realized it was because they were all mixed up and intermingling with each other. One group of whales we saw traveling together included partial family groups from all three pods: J16, J26, and J42 with L5, L74, and K26 of all whales! I always find it so interesting to see which whales hang out together when they all mix it up in a superpod like they did this afternoon.

On our
morning
trip, we had reports of most of
L-Pod
moving up the west side of
San Juan Island
. We were able to arrive just south of the Turn Point Lighthouse as the leaders approached. The whales were semi- spread, and it was interesting to watch several orcas approach and pass a purse seiner as he was setting his nets, with one female even doing a very high spyhop! As we watched, we were surprised to have L79 & L88 show up from a very deep dive almost touching each other with every surfacing. L79 was doing very high chin ups on ever surfacing. After the whales had passed, more L Pod whales arrived. L74 decided to announce his presence with a breath-taking breach! For the
afternoon
trip, we had a super pod of whales spread over several miles south of
Point Roberts
. The whales would come up in large groups, and appeared to be in a resting pattern. As the whales slowly moved along, we were able to get some IDs. In one large group we had J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J27 Blackberry, J22 Oreo, and several others that I couldn't ID as Ruffles' huge dorsal fin blocked their saddle patches! It was so incredible to see 20+ whales on the surface simultaneously. We left the whales just north of Alden Bank.
