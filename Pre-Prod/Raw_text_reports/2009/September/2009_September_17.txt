Another report of the Puget Sound
Transients
, forwarded by Ralph Munro: This morning, at

2:00 a.m
. my neighbors about 400 feet to the south were awakened by the splashing and crashing and flapping and calling of them again (the Transient orcas). I didn't get to hear them this time. But at
4:36 a.m. another neighbor, who lives about 500 feet to the north of us, was awakened by the same loud activity. So once again, they had come into
Eld Inlet
and were headed out again. Apparently they are T137's (3 of them) and T 136a (a mom and an offspring). (
these whales were photographed by Cascadia Research & IDs confirmed by the Center for Whale Research a week or so ago - sb
