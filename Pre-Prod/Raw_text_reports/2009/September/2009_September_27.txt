Orca Sightings for September 27, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
While on a pelagic bird trip in
Monterey Bay CA
, we had a great encounter with
four Orcas
. I assumed they were from the CA transient group, but don't know for sure. While we were watching these four do a lot of playing and jumping, three Humpback Whales appeared out of nowhere and get right into the thick of things. I just missed a shot of two of the humpbacks surfacing with two Orcas right in from of their heads! All three humpbacks were adults, and at least two were so massive that I assumed they were females.

My wife, Wendy, spotted a small pod of
Orcas
this afternoon while heading north along the
Kitsap Peninsula
in Puget Sound. Wendy spotted three Orcas about a half mile ahead of us off Eglon about

4:00 PM
. We stopped our trawler and watched them to see where they were going. They were just milling around between Kitsap and the south end of Whidbey Island pretty much in the shipping lanes. As we watched we noted a couple other Orcas. We saw at least
5
whales, but they were spread out a bit so there may have been more. We watched them for about an hour

We were pretty sure these were the 5 Transient orcas that have been down in south Puget Sound since the beginning of Sept, & in looking closely at the photo, thought we could detect what looks like the very small satellite tag placed on T36A by Cascadia Research & NOAA Fisheries on Sept. 20th. When I contacted Brad Hanson with this sighting, he said the sat tag data confirmed that T36A was at this location at that date & time. Cool stuff! You can check out the tracks of T36A & other Transients at Cascadia Research's website. The maps are updated every few days - they have tracks up to Sept. 26th shown now - it is amazing to see how they have checked out every nook & cranny in So. Puget Sound during just the past week!

We met members of
J & K pod
a mile or 2 off of
Eagle Point
, San Juan Island. They were very spread out with frequent changes in direction - lots of foraging going on! Gulls were swooping in looking for scraps of salmon that the Orcas had left behind.

We turned on the
Orca Sound Hydrophones
(NW San Juan Island) & began hearing loud
calls
at

10:45 am
, with some light boat noise. Must be heading north ? as calls were reported on Lime Kiln earlier.
