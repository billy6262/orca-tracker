Orca Sightings for September 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
L pod was around Lime Kiln. It was a beautiful day and great to see the whales, spread out and cruising.

We did encounter several members of
L Pod
at
San Juan Island late
Friday.

The south sound
transients
(5 or 6) were spotted at

11:00 AM
as they travelled east out of
Eld inlet
and toward Case inlet. Broken into two groups as they crossed Budd bay, they came together in the channel south of Squaxin island and began breaching, finning, and circling each other before slowly continuing on past (very close to the beach) the south end of Hartstene. They were cruising very slowly, and appeared to be enjoying a fine morning.

I finally saw my
Orcas
, after loving them for so long and tracking them via your site for at least four. Caroline was the naturalist on our boat and thought perhaps the L's or the splinter L's. Think it was a "subtle" day out there, with them scattered. It was about
2-3 p.m.
just off
Lime Kiln lighthouse/park
.

At
3.30pm
we headed out west toward Sooke and encountered
6 Transient Orca
at
Beecher Bay
, Vancouver Island. T 63 'Chainsaw ', with that unique dorsal fin all chewed up, was traveling with T65 and T65B. It was the first time I have ever seen him. There was another female and youngster traveling along with this group, and trailing way behind was old T14, 'Pender'. He seemed to be shadowing but was clearly, from my perspective, wanting to be within range of the group but not in the group. Interesting to watch. All the transients were heading east along the shoreline and then south east off Race Rocks. We left them to visit the four very active
Humpback Whales
just off Victoria.

Arlene Solomon of Mayne Island called to report a pod of
18 - 20 orcas
near Enterprise Reef, heading north through
Active Pass
at

3:35 pm
. Two trailing whales were adult males with large fins.
*
Saw
transient killer whales (5)
, 1 male, 3 females, 1 possible juvenile male, starting around

1:30 PM
and lasting until about
3:45 PM. They were heading South past Drayton Passage at
Case Inlet/Nisqually Reach
, SW Anderson Is. At about
3:45, they turned back north.

You've probably heard by now that a group of
5 orcas
"toured"
Eld Inlet
this morning. Looked like a large male, a female, 2 juveniles, and another. About

10:15 am
they were headed westbound across the spit at Cooper Point. They went south down Eld Inlet quite a ways, then returned, and headed northbound up Dana Passage. They were gone by noon.
Karen Fraser, Cooper Point, Olympia

The
transient orcas
were spotted traveling north in Dana Passage at about

12:30
. Several boats were right on them. We watched from our beach as they went past, could not tell which way they went when they got out by Johnson Pt.
