============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving a report of approximately 20 whales in San Juan Channel, Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Astrid van Ginnekin and Stefan Jacobs encountered L's heading north close to shore off
Shaw Island
(48째 34.94 N, 123째 01.90 W) at

1:20 p.m
. The whales turned and went west through Spieden Channel and then headed south down the west side of San Juan Island. The encounter ended at
4:25 p.m. off Bellevue Point (48째 32.27 N, 123째 10.36 W) with the whales spread out in loose groups. The groups seen were: L26's, L43's, L4's and L21's. K's were reported in the area, but none were seen or documented by the Center. J's were reported off the west side.

Plenty of mixed up [
orcas
], so to speak, near
Lopez
. We are fairly certain we saw K21, Cappucino, and we definitely saw J1, Ruffles. The whales were grouping up and travelling in fairly stately fashion with a few breaches, pectoral waves and tail lobs.

While cruising back to Sidney from Friday harbour today we encountered "
L pod
" in
San Juan channel
heading north. They were directly East out of Friday Harbour, and were moving quickly up the channel 5-6 knots. We tagged along up the channel but at a respectable distance as the whales were surrounded by 9-10 WW boats and some other recreational boats. We left the area at the east entrance to Spieden channel as the whales slowed to decide which direction to go, along with the boats.

We luckily received a call from Charles Smith while waiting to catch the
11:05 ferry to Friday Harbor. Thanks to this tip, we were on the lookout and found the pod of
orcas
in
San Juan Channel
, heading north along the shore of Shaw Island at

11:45 am
. The ferry stopped so we could all watch, some spyhops, foraging behavior and a breach or two. We watched until the ferry docked at about
12:30, then we went up the hillside in
Friday Harbor
and watched as they passed across the harbor from

12:45 - 1 pm, continuing north up San Juan Channel. From our photos & confirmation from the Center for Whale Research who was out with them, these whales were identified as the
L37s
.

Lopez Island
heading to the northwest.

Today, for the third time this summer, members of the
Southern Resident Community
(some if not all of L Pod and likely K Pod, to be exact) traveled all the way through
San Juan Channel
. They then continued through the Speiden Channel. We travelled alongside L's and K's and many other boats. We saw a young calf breach numerous times, many animals were cart, spy hopping, and breaching. For the most part, it didn't appear any fishing behavior was occurring. They traveled in a north/northwesterly direction for the duration of our time with them.
