Orca Sightings for September 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today J-2 Granny and K-11 Georgia, lead subgroups of the pods north along
Henry Island
, from

2:20pm to
3:15pm
, keeping a fast pace against a mildly flooding current. Midway up island, the grand matriarchs headed offshore, and as J-2 headed northwest she breached! and did a few percussives. There were no vocalizations. Each near shore subgroup of 3 to 4 whales, including the J-14 and K-14 families, started heading offshore in line with the route J-2 and K-11 had taken. Except J-1 Ruffles, he was already about Â½ mile offshore, taking his time, swimming in his distinctive leisurely way, like he knows he's number one male!

On the west side of
San Juan island
earlier today I think this may be J45 and his clan, but that is only my best guess.

As I passed the
West Side Preserve
,
Orcas
showed up literally out of nowhere and were swimming near
San Juan Island
! When we arrived in Haro Strait later in the day, the whales had rocketed up the coastline of San Juan and were fast approaching Stuart Island. We took our time to find a good place to stop and watch whales, and before we knew it we were looking right at K25 Scoter. He is a growing male still! Soon he was disappearing in the distance only to be replaced by a group of J Pod whales porpoising towards our boat! It was so cool to see this group of Js, as they were very active-porpoising and breaching. For our last pass, we were set up just past the Turn Point Lighthouse. The water was absolutely a sheet of glass, and we all stopped for a "Kodak Moment" of taking a picture of the lighthouse with Mt. Baker in the background. And then our first surprise- J2 Granny, the 98 year-old matriarch of
J Pod
came behind the boat in a series of very slow surfacings. It was as if she was enjoying the calm waters. And then on the other side of the boat came none other than the matriarch of
K Pod
, K11! It was like having a procession of orca "royalty" coming by to pay us a visit. The finale was having J14 and her family (J30, J37, J40, and J45) come by in a big rollicking group.

At about

10:00 a.m.
I saw 4 or 5
Orcas
from my house on
Johnson Pt
. They were breeching and tail slapping (including the very small one), making for quite a show! I was able to get a couple of photos, which may confirm one is a male. They were on the Anderson Island side of the straight and went around the southern point of the Island. This is two mornings in a row. I'll be on the lookout again.
