Orca Sightings for July 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Kpod and L87
passed again by
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. They were spread out traveling North at approximately

10:30 am
. Some of the whales, such as K20, came inshore close to the kelp. I know they traveled North all the way up to
Swanson Channel
. The last I heard they were at Mouat Pt (Pender Isl.) and that was at about
4pm
.

At approx

3:30PM -
3:45PM
, approx
15 -20 orcas
travelling North fairly quickly, viewed from Thieves Bay on
Pender Island
west side, approx 1/2 mile ?off Pender shores. My friend indicated to me that it might have included K and L pod mixed, but can't confirm this.

From the ID's in the report above, it was likely K pod with L87 - sb

This is Lynette Gilbert from Brookfield Zoo in Illinois. I'm the videographer here and I always have the
hydrophones
on while I edit. Today at
2:05pm CST (

12:05 PST
) I heard something that sounded like
orca click trains
, some squeaks and calls that lasted for about 5 minutes but were not continuous. At least, I hope it was whales and not a distant boat.
