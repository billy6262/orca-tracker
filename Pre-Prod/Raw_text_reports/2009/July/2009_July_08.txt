Orca Sightings for July 8, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Salmon Bank
seems to be the place for whales, seals, and marine birds - hopefully providing a buffet! From

2:10pm until
3:25pm
, during a flooding tide and calm summer waters, we watched orcas from
J-K-L Pods
mill and forage. J-26 Mike is easy to spot with the way his dorsal fin leans left, he was lunging, making many directional changes and breached! He didn't stray too far from mom J- 16 Slick. L-72 Racer with very active 5 year old son Fluke went back and forth too. We saw another group with some bellies up - mating? We listened to vocalizations, some of the K calls remind me of cats mewling!

3pm
Zodiac found some members of
J pod and L pod
at
Hein Bank
putting on quite a show close to a tide line. It was fun to watch what looked like the 'chase', L77 'Matia' being pursued by a male, who was really putting on a show of enthusiasm, with tail lobs and somersault behaviour at
4pm
. Perhaps it really was all about fish, but it sure looked like fun! Moms and their babies were foraging in the tide line with several spyhops, baby breaches and kelping behaviours. We left them heading north.

We got a call (
0930
) that a group of
orcas
had been spotted in
Rosario Channel
near the Peapods. We heard a ferry reporting they were delayed by a group of orcas near Bird Rocks, so we knew that we were getting close. And soon, one fin after another began appearing on the horizon. The whales were making their way down the east side of Lopez Island, and were in big groups. As they got further down island, they began to speed up towards Colville. Once past the south tip of
Lopez
(
1030
), I was finally able to make my first ID---J1 Ruffles. Soon we saw J2 Granny, and J14 Samish and J45 (her calf). It was so cool to watch the whales fan out and at one point we knew Ruffles must have found a fish or two as he'd come to the surface facing one way, and halfway through his surfacing he'd make a quick turn and a lunge. And we also heard during the morning trip that had we continued north to
Turn Point
, we would have found
K Pod
with the rest of L's. For our afternoon trip, we didn't have to go nearly as far as the morning trip, as the whales seemed content to mill south of Salmon Bank (1300). Whales were spread out in small groups, and we were fortunate to find a group of about 8-10 whales just having a grand time rolling on top of each other, pushing each other around, and doing a lot of surface percussives, tail lobs, pec slaps, one dorsal fin slap and several breaches. We had the hydrophone in for awhile and could hear so many vocalizations. We got ready to leave and pulled up the hydrophone, but the vocals continued as our rowdy orca group did several vocalizations at the surface, such a treat! Needless to say, it was a perfect ending to our viewing. Last I heard, all three pods were still slowly milling offshore several miles with no apparent direction.

South of
Salmon Bank
(
1300
) - I thought I saw a
minke
whale amongst the orcas--but I was mistaken--it was
2 minke whales
swimming side by side!!!

11:55 am:
Hearing k-calls as
orcas
transit south (on
OrcaSound
hydrphone. NW San Juan Isl.). Some right close to shore and others spread out in the middle of the shipping channel with large ships passing as well.

We had a large and very spread-out [
orca
] pod travel past South Lopez late this
morning
. I watched them travelling east-to-west between Aleck Bay and Iceberg Point between about

11:30 and
12:00
. Our daughter had seen them a bit earlier passing by Hughes Bay.
