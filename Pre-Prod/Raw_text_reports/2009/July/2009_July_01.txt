Orca Sightings for July 1, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went toBoundary Pass to see
J-Pod
traveling east past North Pender toward
Saturna Island
, between

2:25 and
3:15pm
, with the last of the flooding tide. Nice to see J-Pod in familiar family groups, with J-2 Granny and J-1 Ruffles leading the way. They were spread out quite a ways from the leaders to the trailers, with some tail lobbing, pectoral slapping, and breaches as they passed Plumper Sound. J-44 and J-45 looking well with the trailing families!

Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah encountered
J pod
a few miles north of
Turn Poin
t (48째 42.440 N; 123째 14.282 W) at
1:30 p.m. The J22's, and J17's were in a tight group milling off Bedwell Harbour. All the J's later grouped up and were travelling very close to shore off Pender Island, B.C. (48째 44.245 N; 123째 09.165 W).Due to unfavorable weather and boat conditions the encounter ended at

2:55 p.m
. The J's continued to travel north up
Boundary Pass
.

observed from shore at Smallpox Bay on
San Juan Island
. Both male and female/juvenile dorsal fins were visible as the pod traveled Northbound. Orcas exhibited a fluke slap, spyhop, and sideways breech as they continued North without stopping or changing direction.
