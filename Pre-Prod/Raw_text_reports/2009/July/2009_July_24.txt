Orca Sightings for July 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
traveling against a strong flood tide, at a slow pace, almost a resting pattern, south down
Rosario Strait
at

2:14pm
. Matrilines together in 2 tight groups. J-2 Granny classically leading the pod with J-1 Ruffles right behind her. Delightful to see the big boys- J-26, J-27, and J-30, along with the babies- J-44 & J-45. Two year old J- 42 Echo, still seems to have an orangey tint to her white patches, was her birth premature? A few tail lobs as they leisurely made their way toward Lopez Island at about
3:20pm.

At approx

9:30 pm
I returned home to find [
orcas
] headed south. The fins were just barely visible in the fading night, but they were so close to shore their blows echoed off the shoreline and up the hills of
Hannah Heights
. I am not sure I have ever heard their breaths so clearly---or so amazingly loud----all intermingled with tail lobs and pec slaps.

Orca sighting: members of
J Pod
spotted feeding south of
Deadman's Bay
at
9.20pm
. Approximately 7-10 individuals; initially heading north but turned around at Deadman's Bay and went back south. Whales simultaneously changed direction. Two females in particular feeding very close to shore.

Out on the boat today, from roughly

1:30 pm to
7:00 pm
, we followed
Jpod
from Bellingham Channel down
Rosario Strait
and around Lopez as they headed North towards
San Juan Island
. We were able to indentify J1 and J27. There was a lot of active surface behaviors. For most of the day, they were traveling in tight groups.

J pod
was spread apart and doing a few breaches and as we followed them down
Rosario
to Cypress Island, they all joined up! They were doing lots of tail slaps and spyhops. It was amazing to see the whole pod so close together and playing with each other and to see Ruffles and Granny right at the front leading the pod!

10:45am
- I am watching the whales (
orcas
) go south past
Lummi Island
just north of Fern Point. Looks like 5-6 of them. Moving right along!
