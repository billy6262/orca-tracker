Orca Sightings for July 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gato Verde sighted 1 pod of
harbor porpoise
at

5:30
. We were at 48.37.44N 122.44.22W 1.4nm NE of Towhead island (north of Cypress Is.) in Rosario Strait. There were 3 or 4 animals, probably feeding. We saw lots of Auklets with fish in the same area and I assume they were feeding on the same schools.
