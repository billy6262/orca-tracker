Orca Sightings for July 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Matt Klope for forwarding this sighting on: I saw [
orcas
] between
0830 and 0900
at
NAS Whidbey Island
. I was standing on Nortz gate road looking west and you can see Smith Island in the background on a couple of the shots. It was a very low tide and incoming. The whales were estimated 200-300 meters off the beach. I notice 3 separate groups of Whales feeding. One with an adult and 3 calves, one with an adult and one calf and another adult single. There was an occasional breech by the calves (pic).

We showed Chip's photos to Dave Ellifrit at the Center for Whale Research, & he ID'd the following:
J26
in the first pic and
J30
in the next couple.

2:15pm
- Orcas observed from shore at
Lime Kiln Point
, San Juan Island. A female led the set, traveling Northbound. Next came a mixed group of males and females, including a calf swimming out of the female's slipstream. Two males came in about 25 yards from shore, turning sideways to face West as the strong current pushed them though the rapids at the surface by the point. A female and a calf exhibited cartwheels, one after the other. This pair then surfaced at the same time, the calf trailing. After a pec slap, one female changed orientation, but not direction, as she faced South and was pushed Northward on the current.

5:45pm
-
Orcas
observed from shore at
County Park, San Juan Island
. Breach observed far to the North. Through binoculars, some thrashing was observed at the surface, followed by a lunging dive at a 45 degree angle. Some erratic surfacing followed, with male dorsal fins waving back and forth in the fury. Next a female surfaced, far ahead of the others, traveling Southbound. A quadruple-spyhop was observed by the group behind her, each animal surfacing a split second after the other. Next there were some soft tail slaps, and a breach. Several mixed sets of males and females then passed, including a female with a juvenile swimming in her slipstream at her right side. Meanwhile, a harbor seal popped up just off shore, then raising its snout and submerging again. An array of male dorsals then passed, the group surfacing in unison about three times. After a reverse- direction spyhop, another couple of mixed-gender sets followed until the surface of the Strait returned to calm.

Our morning trip aboard the Western Prince had us heading down to the south of
San Juan Island
where we were able to watch members of the
L2s
(
1115
). They were still doing the "west side shuffle" along the shoreline, and we were all hoping that they were finding some salmon to eat. We then started heading back towards Salmon Bank when the morning excitement began. We had heard reports of
J's & K's at Point Roberts
heading down towards the islands, so imagine our surprise at having J-Pod find us at Salmon Bank (
1230
). No one knew they were anywhere close to the area! They came rushing by in familial groups, with lots of tail slaps and breaches and other surface percussives. For the afternoon trip, we finally found the trailing group of whales at
Kellett Bluff
heading north (
1600
). We had J27 Blackberry and an unknown sprouter male giving a great deal of attention to a female orca. Lots of pushing each other from underneath, rolling on each other, spyhops, and general touching behaviors. Soon, all the whales made a direction change to the south (1645), and began to breach, spyhop, porpoise like crazy. It is amazing to see the coordination of movements of orcas. It makes me wonder who, in a superpod is in charge--is it J2 Granny, or maybe K11 Georgia?

We then started heading back towards Salmon Bank when the morning excitement began. First, a
minke whale
surfaced near the Salmon Bank marker (

Forwarded by Dawn Noren of NOAA Fisheries: While coho salmon fishing my dad and I spotted two
killer whales.
Although we didn't get a good look at the second one, the first one had a very tall and noticable dorsal fin. Our coordinates were 43 23 N; 124 32 W. Our port of orgin was Charleston, Oregon. The ocean was a bit too rough to get a closer look and too bumpy to get a decent picture sorry. The time was around

11:45am
.
