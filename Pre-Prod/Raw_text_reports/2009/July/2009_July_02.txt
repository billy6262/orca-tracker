Orca Sightings for July 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving a report of
K and L pods
traveling east from the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
, Center for Whale Research staff Ken Balcomb, Emma Foster, Erin Heydenreich, Basil Von Ah and Tiffany Humphery boarded both vessels Orca and Starlet and departed Snug Harbor. Whales were encountered at

5:07 pm
a few miles off the west side of
San Juan Island
(48째 30.389 N; 123째 10.422 W) spread out in groups milling and moving slowly north. Members of all three pods were present. The whales were very active at the surface, socializing and tactile and very vocal. They were spread out from shore to Kelp Reef. Once they reached Henry Island they turned around and began traveling south. The encounter ended 2 miles off
Hannah Heights
(48째 29.273 N: 123째 08.995 W) as the sun was setting at 9
:11 pm

We caught up with a very spread out
J pod
just west of
Cattle Point
at

1:30
. Granny and Speiden were in the lead, along with a male who I wasn't able to ID. As we arrived on scene there was a private boat motoring along right behind Granny. She quickly responded with 3 consecutive breaches which I interpreted as "Get off my tail!" If I were a whale being chased by a boat, I would think throwing my massive body out of the water and slamming back down might be a good way to get them to back off!!

The
Southern Residents
had met up earlier in the day to form a superpod, and while I was not out on the
1pm
trip I was happy to discover that all three pods (J, K, L) were all still together when we encountered them on the west side of San Juan Island in the evening! They were still traveling northbound at a slow pace, milling about, rolling over, tail slaps, a spyhop or breach from time to time. It was so quiet out that you could hear the vocalizations of the Orcas from hydrophones' on nearby boats! We dropped ours in a few times and heard some great squeals and squeaks and whistles! A little later we had some nice looks at K21 (Cappuccino) and K40 (Raggedy) and another male Orca then some very flirtatious activity between Raggedy and this other male. A little date? and then, as one guest described the mating behavior, "Whales Gone Wild!"

We headed out about
9am
. As soon as we left the dock we received a call that
J's
were headed across
Boundary Pass
returning from their trip to the Fraser River the night before. We met up with J's crossing from Saturna to Turn Point. J30 was the first whale to be identified then the rest of the J14's including the new calf, J45! We traveled with them for a while then moved ahead to the Turn Point Light House. We watched the last two sub-pods come around the point then head south with the rest of J-Pod. Afternoon: We heard that J's had headed out to meet up with L-Pod who were coming in the Strait of Juan de Fuca so we headed for Discovery Island for the meeting of the two pods. We ended up at the southern end of the group and were delighted to see L12. She did two beautiful spy hops that made everyone's day. Next we saw K20 and K38. We are now realizing that this must be a super pod, my first of the season. K38 did three beautiful breaches. Next we had L74 chasing Salmon back and forth. He went down on a long dive and it was anyone's guess where he would come back up. Then to everyone's surprise he surfaced with a mixture of K and L pod members and rolled over in the middle of them with a "Sea Snake."

11:53am - Orca
blows observed from shore on Westside of
San Juan Island
. Orcas approached, traveling Southbound, spread out and passing by for an hour. Orcas had closed saddle-patches and rounded dorsal fins; female and calf seen traveling together nearer to the shoreline.

2:15pm
- Orcas seen from shore at Lime Kiln State Park. Orcas headed Southbound; calf breeched twice.

6:30pm
- Orcas seen from shore from County Park headed Northbound. Numerous animals spread out across Haro Strait, gathering to the North and turning to travel Southbound, passing later in the evening.

After watching
J Pod
come down from the
Fraser River
this
morning
, we picked them up again for the afternoon trip. Word from out west had news of
Ls
coming in. Then news of
Ks
. We were following J26 and 27 and a few other Js, who started to head west. Never thinking that the Ks and Ls could make it in time for the afternoon trip, all of a sudden we got word that they were close. By the end of the afternoon trip were witnessing the Super Pod having a party.

Went to Victoria Harbor about

1:30 pm
seeing
orcas
. After 3 1/2 hours of at least 3 different pods they all headed east to
Haro Strait
. Several males, females, babies. They were playing around by slapping the water with tails, spy hopping a couple of times and the babies jumping up with joy. It was so impressive to all those orcas, went thru about 8 rolls of films. One of the pods was I believe the Jpod. The others we did not get close enough to see the marks.

Orcasound
hydrophones) since about

8:00
.
