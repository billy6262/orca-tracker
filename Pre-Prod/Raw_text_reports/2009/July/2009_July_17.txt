Orca Sightings for July 17, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
A sunny, hazy, lazy summer day watching a
minke
whale fish at
Salmon Bank
in the last part of a flood tide, from about

2:15pm to
3:15pm
.
Caroline Armon, San Juan Island

Here are some of the images I took at about

11:30 AM
. There were two
gray whales
feeding west of
Everett
.

The next two Ocean Magic trips out of Victoria that turned west, had a
Humpback
whale which was my first for this year. It was seen south of
Race Rocks
. It gave us some great fluke shots. There was lots of fish feed and krill around by the activity of the whales and the hundreds of sea birds and gulls over the bait balls. Pics cropped.

Three, possibly 4
Minkes
off
Hein Bank
. I was on the Ocean Magic at 9am and encountered the Minkes. They were busy foraging. The Ocean Magic travelling from Vancouver to Victoria an hour later, apparently had two of these Minkes at Hein Bank breaching which must have been an awesome sight!

John Barrimo of the Olympic Coast Natl. Marine Sanctuary called to report a sighting of a female
orca
with a calf, plus one more individual, mid-day, ~20 miles off
LaPush, WA
.
