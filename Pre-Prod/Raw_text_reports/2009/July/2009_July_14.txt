Orca Sightings for July 14, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We witnessed and travelled alongside the [
orcas
]. Our ferry slowed into otter bay and sat for 15 minutes while the progression swam past. We were headed to Swartz on a throughfare to Tsawwassen and saw the whales again on our pass across the
Georgia Strait
. Was that j14 then who was breeching (
according to report from Jim Maya, it was J14 - sb
)?

We could hear
J Pod
calls on the
Orcasound
hydrophones. By the time we met up with the whales, they were parading past the Pender Bluffs, at the southwest end of
North Pender Island
. The whales appeared to be moving at a very tranquil pace, with J1 and J2 in the lead, as usual. Looks can be deceiving though, as the whales were actually moving by at a quite a clip with the incoming tide at their flukes. As one whale surfaced, it appeared to have an unusual piece of kelp hanging over it's dorsal fin. On closer inspection of a zoomed in photo, it was obvious that L87 [corrected to
L78, Gaia
], will have a new identifying scar - what appears to be rake marks across the fin. On the
PM
trip, we did not have to travel far. The whales had made it almost across the Strait of Georgia and were entering into the foraging area just off the
Fraser River
. We observed many indications of foraging with the whales making quick changes of directions, and some lunges. The Captain on our 2nd boat even saw J1 surface with a salmon in his mouth.

A long boat ride from Friday Harbor caught us up with
Southern Residents
northeast of
Active Pass
in the Strait of Georgia at

3:00 PM
. They were moving quickly, but with a lot of breaches in the area. And not just by juveniles, the big kids were completely clearing the water as well. We tracked them to the coal docks and Tsawwassen.

I don't know what it is with J14. She hits that water between
Active Pass and the Fraser River
and she goes nuts. Js and Ks are up north at the Fraser River, and the Ls are coming in from the West.

A great parade of whales through
Active Pass
this afternoon around

12:45
. About 25 orcas (J pod, we think), heading east. Lots of tail slaps, backstroke and sideways swimming, some breaches. Very spread out, it took about 45 minutes for them all to swim past us.

Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster, John Durban and Jeff Hogan on Starlet boarded both Orca and Starlet and departed Snug Harbor at
8:30 a.m.
J's, K's and the L2's
were encountered off
Kellett Bluff
at

8:44 a.m
. (48째 35.707N; 123째 12.548 W). The whales were spread out in tight groups heading north. The encounter ended at
11:04 a.m. in Swanson Channel (48째 44.380 N; 123째 16.447 W). The whales moved close to shore off North Pender Island, B.C. and traveling slowly north.

At

this morning heard wonderful
calls from Orca-Sound
. Lots of variety (S1, S6, S10 calls) both near and far.

7:50 am
- Great calls on
OrcaSound
hydrophone -- S_1's and more so probably J pod. Update at 8 am: Great calls on OrcaSound hydrophone -- S_1's and more so probably J pod -- spread out and moving northward slowly.
