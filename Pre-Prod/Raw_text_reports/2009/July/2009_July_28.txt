Orca Sightings for July 28, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were trolling along past
Lime Kiln
going south at 1 or 2 knots in my 26' sailboat at about

9:30 AM
and were met by a pod of
orcas
coming north. We took the engine out of gear and pulled the lines and drifted. A large orca surfaced offshore from the boat and made foam without moving. It called three times in the air with the same vocalization. It was facing more of the pod who were approaching and soon passed by. I don't know what it was doing but it was unusual and I have seen orcas in Alaska many times, but this was a treat.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster of the Center for Whale Research encountered mixed groups of
J's ,K's and L's
milling in tight groups two miles off
Hannah Heights
(48째 29.442N; 123째 09.291 W) at

12:40 p.m
. The whales were close in shore for about an hour and then started moving off shore just south of False bay. We observed a lot of milling and socializing behavior. J38 rolled over in front of the boat and has been confirmed male. The whales were spread out in groups and non directional. At
3:45 p.m. the whales made a turn back to shore toward the south end of San Juan Island. They then continued traveling, heading north up island in spread out groups. The encounter ended at
8:50 p.m. just after sunset, a mile north of Kellett Bluff (48째 36.55 N; 123째 12.55 W) .

I went with the 5 star Whale Watch tours - we left Victoria at
2 pm
, and 15 minutes later we spotted the first whale, a
Minke
whale near Oak Bay.

We left Victoria at 2 pm. About 30 minutes after this encounter, we spotted some jumping pink salmon. Up we go, at
3 pm
we finally met what we wanted to meet -
Orcas
- at
San Juan Island
. And not just orcas, it was
superpod
! The meeting took about an hour, then we left again, back to Victoria.

I arrived at the
Land Bank
Property just before
10am
and was delighted to see a small group of
L-pod
members circling between the Kelp and shore. There were three beautiful spy hops, and several surfacings, then a long dive and they surfaced heading south just beyond Edwards Point. I had heard that K's had headed north past the park, and that J's were headed south from Turn Point. As many people gathered at the park we heard that
J's K's and part of L-pod
had met up and were heading south towards the park. The whales seemed to stall at Open Bay, but then continued South passing by between
12 and
12:30pm
. It was amazing to see K11 in the lead (but by herself again). Then many others including K21, J1 without J2, J28, K40 and many others. Then to my delight a whale all of a sudden turned directly towards the shoreline, headed straight for me. She disappeared again and then I spotted her at the edge of the kelp line just below the surface. As she came up for a breath I got a great picture and saw that it was J-2 Granny! Whew Hoo, that was all I needed to make a great day. A few more whales came close to shore, did a couple of breaches and continued South. At 2pm we headed out on the Western Prince. We found the whales about 3 miles south of
False Bay
. They were spread out but in small tight groups with lots of social behavior going on. We parked several 100 yards away and put the Hydrophone in the water. The whales slowly moved our way. It was perfect; they managed to be everywhere we looked but always stayed at least 100 yards away. We sat and watched them for a good half an hour. The vocalizations were amazing and even brought tears of joy to some of our passengers. Sea Snakes, Spy Hops, Breaches, Cartwheels along with lots of tactile behavior. When I arrived home we packed up and headed back out to the west side. We were delighted to see 10 or so whales (spread for miles) slowly headed south.

Had a great day today with
J's and K's
off of
San Juan Island
. They were quite spread apart but pretty active with breaches, tail slaps and spyhops.

We had an incredible pass-by at the
Landbank
land (Latitude, Longitude 48.507507,-123.14283) on SJIsland this
am
.
J's and K's
came right down the beach, less than a 100 yards from shore.
