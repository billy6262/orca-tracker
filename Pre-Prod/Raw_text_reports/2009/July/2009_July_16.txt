Note: A12 is the mother of A33, who was reported missing and presumed dead earlier in the month - after being often sighted alone after the death of her son, she has been seen with other A30 pod members lately - A12 was sighted with the A34s on
July 4th. Between
July 4th and 14th we believe she was alone and travelling in large circles around Hanson Island and down into the Reserve - Jackie Hildering
