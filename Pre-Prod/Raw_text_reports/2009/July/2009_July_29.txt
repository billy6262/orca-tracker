Orca Sightings for July 29, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Went to Canada today, into
Boundary Pass
to see the
L-5's
heading up L-Pod as they crossed from the east to west toward Stuart Island, from

2:30pm to
3:15pm
. Next came the L-86's and we were thrilled to see L-112 looking healthy and active, even venturing away from mom- L-86 Surprise, then porpoising to catch back up! The other L's were spread out to South Pender Island, occasionally breaching and tail lobbing!

My husband and I were visiting Cape Flattery
mid-day
and from the observation deck at the point had good views of a young
gray whale
closely hugging the large jutting rock around the mouth of the two caves. He did swim north along the coast line there after a bit. I photographed him while we were there and have added the photos to this email. He/she looked pretty young. In terms of scale - the black spots on the rock are black oystercatchers. We saw no evidence of his mother and became concerned for him. It would be heartening to know that this youngster might have been of weaning age and therefore was perfectly happy and healthy. It was interesting to note how much time he spent with this particular rock formation, rubbing on it and swimming around and around it.

After receiving a report of whales off
Patos Island
heading southwest, Center staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster departed Snug Harbor at noon. At

12:45 p.m
. we encountered some members of
L pod
off Skipjack Island (48째 45313N; 123째 02.105 W). They were spread out traveling down
Boundary Pass
. We documented most of the L4's, the L26's, L2's, L5's and L54's. The encounter ended just off Blundon Island B.C. (48째 45.001 N; 123째 09.468 W) at
2:38 p.m. The L's continued south and were later seen passing the Center (NW San Juan Island), still spread out in mid
Haro Strait
.

Watched
orcas
off the beach of
Deception Pass
State Park at about
7-8 p.m
. They approached from the north. They were a bit spread out so difficult to count. At least 10. Several adults with large, straight dorsals. Very young orca staying close to specific adult. They lingered off the beach for at least 15-20 minutes. They appeared to be feeding, surfacing briefly for air, sometimes in the same general spot. They changed directions several times. Baby orca seemed very active alongside adult. Three to four incidents of surfacing with tail slapping by adults. One spyhopping.

At

6:10 pm
Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries called reporting some
J's and L's
heading south along the north end of Whidbey, outside
Deception Pass
. They were with them conducting their fecal & scale sampling research.
*
After receiving several calls that Southern Resident
orcas
were off Deception Pass heading south down NW Whidbey Island, we headed to the north end of West Beach to catch a glimpse. At

7:05
pm we started seeing orcas very spread out & heading south, doing some foraging. We watched until about
8 pm
, then headed south to Pt. Partridge. From there, we watched until dark (~

9:30 pm
) as the orcas passed between
Whidbey & Smith Islands
, still heading south under a beautiful sunset. Though the orcas were offshore from 1/2 mile to several miles. We ID'd J1 and up to 6 males or sprouters. They were so spread out and distant it was difficult to get an estimate of how many were present, or confirm more IDs.

8 pm

orca
pod off
west beach
(NW Whidbey) for the last 45 min.

I live on
West Beach
Rd, south of Oak Harbor, at the end of Hastie Lake Rd on Whidbey Island. Last night a group of
Orcas
spent 45 mins to an hour between Smith Island and West Beach, headed south towards Ft Casey. To my untrained eye it looked like one or two large males and several females with small young whales.

On the morning trip, we met members of
all three pods
in the Strait of Georgia. We left them off
Lummi Island
after having observed them for about two hours. They were very active. Lots of tail lobs and breaches - and even a cartwheel. I can't remember who all we saw - other than Ruffles, Granny, Blackberry and Mike. I was clearly not listening well. We headed back to Anacortes, unloaded and reloaded and then met the whales again basically where Guemes Channel dumps into
Rosario Strait
. Still members of
all three pods
. We watched them for hours - all the way to NAS Whidbey.
J42
put on quite a show - nine goofy baby breaches and she spyhopped us - right off the stern - with kelp in her mouth. We also think we may have witnessed some mating behavior off the Burrows Lighthouse. The whale poop scoopers were REALLY close, so they might have more info on that.

Is it me, or is there a lot of "belly floppin" going on these days? On the

3:30
Ocean Magic Adventure, we found ourselves in flat calm seas. It was so quiet we could hear the echo of the
orca
's breath across the water, an unforgettable sound. We began around
Henry Island
as
L pod
was heading southbound. They were very spread apart mainly traveling but as you can see some belly flops along the way. The animals were seen heading south towards Lime Kiln park where as usual, an anxious fan crowd awaited them. Animals were spread right out into the middle of Haro Strait.

My wife and I saw a
Minke
Whale today about 100 yards north of the
salmon bank
buoy at about
3PM
(+/- 30 min). The whale surfaced about 30 feet in front of our boat and then again twice more heading south. It was moving slowly, maybe 4 knots. It's hard to say, but it was probably 25 feet. No markings.

I just recieved the following email from a friend: "About
9AM
I saw
two gray whales
swimming very close to shore heading east along the shore of the
Dungeness
Wildlife Refuge." I then recieved the additional info that USFWS volunteers at Dungeness Refuge have had several sightings of the grays over the past few days.
