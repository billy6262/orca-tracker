We found
L's mixed in with K's and J's
. 'Cappuccino' was obvious swimming close by his sister K 40 'Raggedy'. We found them off Lime Kilm Park at
1pm
and heading out into
Haro Strait
. There were so many big fins out there, that at times it was hard to know who was who - J 30 looked like K 26 or K 25 and even L 89 or L 85 - it was hard to know who was who when saddle patches look almost identical and sprouters were among the more mature whales. Whales were everywhere but all spread out, and all heading north with some foraging in between. The Ocean Magic caught up with them again almost at Swanson Channel, off Pender Island, at 4.30pm still heading north.

Late this
morning
I received word that there were whales off of
Eagle Point
and sure enough, within the next hour- they showed up milling off the west side of the Island. With all the clouds, the lighting was perfect to watch lots of tail lobs, rolls and tactile behaviors. I was able to see several J pod whales and a couple of L's- lots of play by the youngsters.

We saw a super pod all three pods: J,K and L, right off of Henry Island. It was amazing. At first they were a little spread out, and appeared to be fishing. Some orcas were very close to shore; some were slapping their flukes, maybe to stun the fish. The Southern Resident Orcas eat fish and they really seem to prefer Chinook salmon. They seemed to be working together. There were a couple big breaches and even some spy hopping. The orcas then began moving north, toward Stuart Island; it wasn't till then that we realized we
