Haro Strait
, with no others around until about

when her 2-year old

arrived. It actually started at

8:10
with foraging off Bellevue Pt. off in the distance for about 2 hours until they meandered as far as the Center for Whale Research around 10 AM, then moved further north about
noon

This morning we were awoken at

6:00 am
to see the [

] headed north- and after a run to
Lime Kiln
, we were able to see many members of J pod languidly making their way north VERY spread out. Lots of active foraging.
