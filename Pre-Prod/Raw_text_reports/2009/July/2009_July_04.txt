Orca Sightings for July 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We sighted a
grey whale
heading south off shore about a quarter mile north of
Point No Point
, on the west side of Puget Sound late afternoon. The lighthouse coordinates are 47°54'44"N; 122°31'36"W. It was not fully surfaced, but first we saw a spray of water and then a portion of the body became visible before it lowered itself into the water. I doubt whether anyone else spotted it.

5:30pm - Orcas
observed from shore at
Lime Kiln Point
, approaching from the North. Approximately five animals were present, with three male dorsal fins at least one female dorsal fin recognized. Orcas continued Southbound, momentarily turning their bearing Westward toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca, then turning to continue to the South out of sight.

A nice start to the holiday this morning with an
orca
visit early this morning. About

6:15am
just over a dozen were swimming west along the south shore of
Lopez
, headed from Aleck Bay toward Iceberg Point. They were followed by another dozen or more about 20 minutes later. While most continued west, about half a dozen spent 15 minutes or so milling just east of Iceberg Point before heading off with a couple tail slaps and a nice breach. They were clearly residents as the harbor seals didn't seem to mind them at all.

Sally Reeve called & emailed us with this 4th of July morning report:
Iceberg point lopez
- Grand way to celebrate the holiday.
Orcas
traveling east to west. Very relaxed travel with some breaches and direction changes with regrouping. Amazingly beautiful sunrise with Orcas,
6 am to 7am
.

At approximately

6:30 p.m.
, I saw a
gray whale
in front of a beach house I own in
Eglon, WA
. Eglon is about halfway between Kingston and
Point No Point
in north Kitsap county. The sighting was also witnessed by two guests. There was only one whale, he blew once then went under. A few minutes later he resurfaced and I could tell by the size and texture of his back that it was a gray whale, not an Orca. He was heading south towards Kingston and was approximately 75 yards from the mainland.
