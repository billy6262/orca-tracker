Orca Network received a call from Chrissy MacClean of the Port Townsend Marine Science Center - she was on the
Edmonds/Kingston ferry
at

2:30 pm
and saw
~10 orcas
from the ferry, heading north, with some foraging. This is likely J & K pods from yesterday, but no confirmation on ID's at this time.
*
Anthony Woelke of WA State Ferries, aboard the Puyallup ferry, called to report several small pods of
orcas
spread out, mid-channel between
Edmonds and Kingston
, between Jeff Head & Edward Pt. at

2:05 pm
, heading slowly north and appeared to be foraging. He saw a male, female & small calf, another group of 4 swimming abreast, and another 10+ beyond them. They also saw 1 spout further out that didn't look like an orca spout - possible gray whale?

Graham DeWitt of WA State Ferries (

Island headed north in heavy seas at

A couple of

Oak Bay
