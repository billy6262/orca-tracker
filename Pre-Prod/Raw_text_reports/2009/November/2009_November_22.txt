We were on the ferry this afternoon at about
three pm
headed into
Bainbridge Island
and saw 6-8 (?)
Orcas
between Blake Rock and Port Blakely, with lots of blowing and a breach or two. From the direction of the blows and the splashing, definitely headed east.

Amy Carey of
Vashon Island
found the orcas at

10:10 am
, heading south passing through the Vashon ferry lanes. At

11:03 am
they were at Dilworth, N.Vashon, heading south. By around
12:30 pm they were midway between Dilworth and Pt. Robinson, but then she lost them in the wind and choppy seas.

10:23 am:
We just saw
2-3 adult orcas
and a smaller one heading south from the
Fauntleroy
ferry terminal. Last seen heading south past Brace Point!

10:26 am:
Now there are more splashing around in the distant wake of the ferry heading to
Vashon
. Lots of splashing and fins/tails popping up. Some jumping. Now heading towards Southworth.
