Orca Sightings for November 16, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am reporting the sighting of 5
Orca
about 1/2 mile NNE of
Race Rocks
, British Columbia. The Orca were all female with 1 yearling calf. When first contacted the Orca were swirling in a feeding pattern. The Orca stayed in one area and then moved away at a high rate of speed (~10 NMPH) moving in dolphin fashion rather than their normal movement. After moving for about 5 minutes they again swirled for several minutes and then moved away again and again at a high rate of speed. Direction of movement was NNE towards Constance Bank but we did not follow them that far. Contact time was
1510 - 1530
. Saw 3 spy hops. No photographs were taken. And an update: In conversation with another driver today I was informed that they were the
T46
pod. The other driver had been with this pod earlier in the day as they moved east from Beacher Bay. He left the Orcas as they entered Race Passage as this is a no-go area for whale watching boats. I had the good fortune to contact the pod as they came out the other side of Race Passage. Sincerely,
