Orca Sightings for November 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
gray whale
just west of the Ballard Locks around noon on Wednesday, and he sent us this photo. He said it was there for about 20 minutes and then disappeared.

Have been listening much of the afternoon. Just heard
calls
at

16:50
on the
Port Townsend

Orca Network received a call from Scott on the Victoria Clipper IV at

8:24 am
, reporting a pod of
15 - 20 orcas
(J pod?) heading south off West Pt, just N. of
Seattle
. After receiving this report, NOAA and another researcher headed out in boats to find the pod, and we had volunteers on shore looking from Alki to Edmonds to Whidbey to Marrowstone, with no other sightings all day until we heard the calls on the Port Townsend hydrophones this evening - those whales must really be traveling in stealth mode!
