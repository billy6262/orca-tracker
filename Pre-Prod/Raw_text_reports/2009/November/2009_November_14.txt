Orca Sightings for November 14, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went out with Capt Jim (Maya) today. We had an amazing encounter with some
J Pod
whales and especially with Polaris J-28 and the newest baby J-46 south of Race Rocks. They were with new Grandma Princess Angeline J-17 and her youngest offspring J-44. J-17's other offspring, Tahlequah J-35, was traveling with the J-16s. I posted some pictures of J-46 as mom pushed him/her around.
