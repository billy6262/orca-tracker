Orca Sightings for November 27, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call today from John Reynolds, reporting a [gray?] whale feeding in
Agate Pass
, between Bainbridge Island and the Kitsap Peninsula at approximately

2:30 pm
, 150 yards south of the channel marker. He thought it was possibly a Minke whale, it had a small fin and was 30 - 32 ft. long, the flukes looked like humpback flukes, but it surfaced more like a Minke.
