Orca Sightings for November 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am a long time boater that has been on the water observing Orca's for aver 40 years, my home is in North Beach (North
Ballard
) in Seattle and we have a view of the sound from Meadow Point North, up the sound to Whidbey. From
3 to 4 pm
I observed at least a dozen
Orcas
playing about a half mile North of Meadow Point with multiple breaches and hunting maneuvers. It was amazing!

After receiving the report below of
orcas
off S. Whidbey heading north, we headed out to look for them soon as the fog lifted. We looked from the bluffs off Lagoon Pt, Bush Pt, Mutiny Bay, and finally Scatchet head. Just as we were about to give up, at

2:20 pm
Howie saw a big splash in the distance from our perch at Scatchet Head (SW Whidbey). It was followed by another splash or two, and several blows, enough to confirm that the orcas were between
Pt. Wells
(S. of Edmonds) and
Shilshole
marina. They were too distant to tell what direction (if any) they were traveling, but at least we'd finally found them - just a few miles south of where they'd first been reported four hours earlier! Our guess is that this is still J pod, chasing chum salmon around Puget Sound.

A pod of
12 orcas
was sighted off the
Edmonds
Washington State Ferry Dock today about
2 PM
heading south.

I got a call from Billy Wind who came across a pod of
Orcas
south of Whidbey near
Possession Point
in his sailing vessel around

10:20 am
. Billy said there were 7-8 in the pod with one alpha male and one young whale. They were feeding and traveling towards the west side of Whidbey heading northwest.

Just wanted to let everyone know that we spotted a
Gray whale
off the "trap shack" (East
Sooke Park, Vancouver Island
) while on a Marine Adventure tour. 2pm. Seemed to be heading toward the East while milling around in lots of feed. Aprox.10-12 min dives in flat calm water, though quite elusive as we managed only a couple of quick glimpses before moving on.

Orca Network received a call from someone on a boat today reporting
orcas
off the
OR coast
at
1335
- a female and a juvenile orca, possibly others, at 44.50N, 124.43W (approx. 16 mi. SW off
Newport, OR
).
