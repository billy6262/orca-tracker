Orca Sightings for November 3, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We observed a
Minke
in
Admiralty Inlet
at

12:30 pm
- it was off Pt. Townsend and appeared to be swimming first in a northwesterly direction, then in a N/NE direction, presumably foraging.

Mark Malleson, Pina Gruden (from Morigenos, a Slovenian non-profit marine mammal research and conservation society), and I joined Mark on Gonzales lookout in Victoria and saw blows towards
Race Rocks
, followed by another group closer to the Victoria waterfront. We launched and after a quick search we encountered U38 and U39 (U stands for "Unknown" since these animals have yet to be confirmed members of the west coast T community) swimming towards
T103 and T49A
group who were exhibiting typical post-kill behaviour. The two groups got to within 300m of each other but never mixed. We ended the encounter approximately an hour after first contact. That's about it! Have fun,

Orca Network received a call from Rick Huey of Washington State Ferries, relaying a sighting of
orcas
between Vashon and Blake Islands. The orcas were between the Southworth Ferry dock and the point to the north of it from
11 am until 3 pm
, then they moved north to the west side of Blake Island and then out of sight, presumably futher north.
