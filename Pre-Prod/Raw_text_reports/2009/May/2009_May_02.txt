Orca Sightings for May 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 Gray whales
off West Beach for the past 3 days, about 400 yds. N. of Hastie Lake Rd,
between Pt. Partridge and Sunset beach
, approx. 600 yards offshore. He observed 1 Gray whale there this morning,
May 4th around
8:40, then at
10:30 he called to say he was now seeing 2 Grays.

Entry 2:
I saw a
gray whale
surfacing and diving in
Useless Bay
off the west side of Whidbey Island.

Since you asked about recent sightings in Saratoga, while out shrimping Saturday morning, my husband and I headed over towards
Baby Island
. While there, we spotted a lone
gray
spouting occasionally. Not familiar enough with the shoreline there to know if he was feeding, but I don't believe so.

We found a group of about
5 transients
in
Active Pass
. We travelled with them into Swanson channel and they were travelling southbound when we left. I got a few really good ID shots so I thought I'd send them in.

ID's on the Active Pass Transients in photos from
May 2 by Jill Persick: Looks like the
T124A's
and the
T86A's
. The first pic is
T124A2
and
T86A
.

My guess is the one with the 2 nicks could be
T86A
. The one with it could be
T86A2
.

Been watching
two grays
on Friday and Saturday-off bluff at Fort Nugent and
West Beach
. Close to shore at times, seem to be eating in a pattern and staying close together. One seems much larger than the other.
