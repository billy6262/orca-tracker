Orca Sightings for May 1, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Been watching
two grays
on Friday and Saturday-off bluff at Fort Nugent and
West Beach
. Close to shore at times, seem to be eating in a pattern and staying close together. One seems much larger than the other.

We received a call from a woman who was watching a
Gray whale
in south
Saratoga Passage
at

1:45 pm
.
*
We received a call from David Moses, who was watching a
Gray whale
about 1/2 mile off
Priest Pt
, near Tulalip, WA for 2.5 hours in the same exact spot. It seemed to be on its side, and then its head or fluke would come up, but it never changed direction or moved from the spot it was in as he watched it from

9:30 - noon
. He was concerned as the tide was starting to go out and it was in a shallow area, but at

12:30
he called back to say the whale had finally moved and was breathing and swimming normally.
*
Morning
, at least
two grays
still here.

4:00 pm
,
three grays
just passed by
Kayak Point
close to shore moving north.

Two
gray whales
were seen in
Elger bay
Camano Island Wa. They were seen around

9:45 a.m
. They were coming up and out of the water. They stayed around for about 30 minutes, then headed south.

Two grays
dropped into the
Elger Bay
"restuarant" this morning for a "snack." I watched them from about

9:00 to
9:30
or so.

Mabana
(SW Camano Isl) about

6:30 AM
