Orca Sightings for May 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
The following photos (see above) were taken near Flores Island, Clayoquot Sound. We encountered the same whale on two different occasionsand is easily recognized by the local tour boat captains as a regular summer
resident grey whale
though its light coloured head and unique markings. There were other grey whales in the large outer swells and foraging in the bays off the west coast of the island but this individual seemed to prefer the more sheltered east and south sides that day.

This morning between

8:30 and
9:30 AM
, two
gray whales
came from the NW feeding in the shallow water NW of
Langley
. One of the whales was clearly Patch (#49) and I'm not sure about the ID of the second whale. The whales worked their way back and forth and then headed out towards Camano. Update at
1:50 pm: 1 Gray whale mid- channel in Saratoga Passage, off NW Langley heading NW.
