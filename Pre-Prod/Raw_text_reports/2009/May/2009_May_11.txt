Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research received a report of ~20
orcas
in Shelter Cove, between
Ft. Bragg & Eureka, CA
, killing sea lions close to shore.

Orca Network received a message from Carlos Cordina (sp?) on
May 11th reporting he was out in a boat near Crescent City, CA and encountered a lot of
orcas

We had a great encounter with
J pod
today in the
Strait of Georgia
. They were breaching like crazy and we saw several spyhops as well. It was a bit rainy when we first arrived on scene, but luckily the sun came out for us and we got an amazing show!

We received a call from Kay Ogren reporting a small, thin looking
gray whale
heading past Yokeko Pt., Fidalgo Island (NE of
Deception Pass
bridge) at about

4:30 pm
, heading east & north up into Similk Bay. She said it was close to shore when she saw it, & it didn't look like it had the "bulk" of other gray whales she's seen. A neighbor watched it later, a bit further out from shore, continuing to head north into Similk Bay.
*
Just spied two
Gray whales

Langley
Marina at
