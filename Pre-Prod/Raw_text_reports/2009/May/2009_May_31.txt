May 24 & 31 - I have 2 grey Whale sightings to report:

Entry 2:
3:30 PM to
4:15 We spend 45 minutes with a Grey at Golden Gardens Park. It first breached and blew off of North Beach - then we stayed with it for 45 minutes as it bottom fed along the shore of Golden gardens. sometimes within 30 ' of shore.

This majestic bull
T12A
was out there keeping company with
T109A
and
T109A2
. We had good looks of the three of them slowly heading out west. He has a Dorsal fin rather like Ruffles, full of nice waves. We encountered them just
south of Trail Island
and they were in a resting pattern with very long dives.

Working up here in SE Alaska has giving me yet another opportunity to view our awesome black and white friends in their world. I was out halibut fishing yesterday afternoon in
Lynn Canal north of Juneau
and had upwards of
20 orcas
come through. They have been hanging around the area for a couple of weeks and we were finally able to see them. We watched them breach, spyhop and tailslap. One even rolled over on its back and was slapping its fins.

About
9 a.m.
we saw a
minke
whale surface a few times. This was about two miles southwest of
Smith Island
. Also, all day we saw lots of what we think were
Dall's porpoises.

We heard that there was a group of
Transients
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
near the Romeo marker, so we were happy to hear we had whales in the area. As we left the dock, we heard that it was actually a large group of Transients,
numbering between 14-20
. Wow! We arrived about 6 miles north of Sequim at
1320
and slowly approached the area the whales were sighted. The perfectly glassy calm water made spotting the whales very easy, and we shut down about 450 yards from the group. Amazingly--they were in a definite resting pattern, with all 14 whales slowly rising to the surface in unison in a tight, contact pattern. This went on for about 15 minutes until one of the whales decided "nap time" was over. Then the whales began zig-zagging in what appeared to be a random pattern, breaking into smaller groups and then coalescing into a big group again. Soon the Transients were spy-hopping, tail slapping, and then a swirl of water around 3-4 whales--followed by a bunch of seagulls swarming the area. They had made a stealthy kill, and we can only guess it was a porpoise as there were dozens in the area. This was followed by several breaches!! And for only the 3rd time in 12 years--I witnessed whales swimming backwards four times! It always catches me off-guard to see a dorsal fin going backwards! No vocalizations, but amazing to see Transients so active! We left the scene at 1410 as the whales continued heading easterly.

Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called to relay a report of
a large group of 18 Transients
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
- the
T30's, T100's, T101's, T124's, T90 & T90B
. They followed them as they headed east, leaving them at

4:30 pm
off
Pt. Wilson
, still heading east.
*
Ken Balcomb & Emma Foster of the Center for Whale Research had
3 other Transient orcas: T12A, T109A, & T109A2
, south of
Discovery Island
at
11 am
, heading west.
*
A pod of
orcas
went past
Pt No Pt
(N. Kitsap Peninsula) from
8-
8:45
pm. Two whales were seen at around 8pm by beach walkers and then a second group came by around
8:30pm. There was at least one large male and 3-4 females in the second group. They were travelling
south
towards Kingston. The second pod hung out about Â¼ mile past the lighthouse at Pt No Pt and did some breaching and tail lobs.

Bev Wenthin of
Bush Pt
. called to report
3 orcas
just north of Bush Pt. at

6:32 pm
, heading south. They were between mid-channel & the far side of Admiralty Inlet.
*
About
2PM
off
Partridge Point
there was a pod of
Orcas
doing a little fishing. They were probably 10-15 miles offshore from where I am near Partridge Point, so there wasn't a lot of see from my vantage point, but the male's dorsals were unmistakable even from afar.

Cathy Kelly of
Saltery Bay, BC
(27km south of Powell River) called Orca Network with a sighting of
6-8 orcas
traveling NE past the Saltery Bay ferry terminal, up Jervis Inlet at
11 AM
. At least one male and one juvenile were among them.
*
On the trip home we also found a lone
minke
whale between
Middle Bank and Salmon Bank
.

I spotted a
Minke Whale
heading west. 1.5 miles south of
Eagle Point
(San Juan Island). I watched the Minke for 45 min. it was traveling at 4 to 6 knots.

After telling a friend yesterday that we don't often see whales in
Port Townsend Bay
, today several groups of rowers saw the
Gray whale
, roughly between
10 and 11 AM
, closer to Indian Island than to downtown Port Townsend. It was about 200 yards from our boat, slowly cruising, showing small parts of its body at a time. It was visible for about 3 minutes. It may have been a juvenile, roughly 25 feet long, maybe shorter - comparing it to the length of the skeleton we have at the Marine Science Center. Its body had the typical patches of barnacles but what was more noticeable was the scarring along much of its body, especially on its tail -- long white slashes that may have come from encounters with propellers or possible entanglement with a net. Especially exciting since I remember an earlier visit by a grey on Memorial Day as well (and today "really" is Memorial Day.)
