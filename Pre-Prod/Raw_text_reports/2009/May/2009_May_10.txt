Orca Sightings for May 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
From about

6:30 to
9:30 AM
. Our beach is in the cove 1/2 mile north of Beverly Beach (E. Holmes Harbor). After the tide became too low, we heard the
gray whale
heading south looking for snacks.

We spent much of the afternoon watching several
Grey Whales
right off the beach inside the kelp line feeding. The pair was a juvenile and an adult. At times both were within 75' off shore. Sightings range was from Shipwreck point to Chito Beach Resort 48
*
18' 27" 124
*
25'45".

Report forwarded by Candi Emmons, NWFSC: I was working in Astoria on Sunday and was told by a few fishermen that they saw some
killer whales
within 40 fathoms of the
Oregon
coast between the Astoria jetty and Cannon Beach's reefs on Sunday.

At

11:30 PM
we heard a
gray whale
splashing as it fed for about ½ an hour in front of our house, NW of
Langley
.

One
gray
spotted about

7:40 PM
heading toward our beach (1/2 mile north of
Onamac
beach) to feed. We, along with our neighbors, enjoyed watching the big fella feed & blow in the shallows for about 45 minutes. He would make a parallel pass along the beach and then would turn and give it another go in the other direction.

At San Juan County Park I realized there really was a
gray whale
!

I saw two
gray whales
about

5:00pm
in
Port Susan
right off the shore of Camano Island, about a mile north of Tillicum Beach (about 2/3 of the way down the east side of Camano Island).
Julius Budos, Camano Island

Sally Bigger of Freeland called to report a
Gray whale
in
Holmes Harbor
, heard by a neighbor off Beverly Beach at
9 am
, then seen by another neighbor at
5 pm
feeding.
*
Debra Buck called to report seeing
3 Grays
together in
Port Susan
, midway between Warm Beach & Camano Island, heading north toward Stanwood at

3:45 pm
.
*
This morning we observed a single
gray whale
feeding on ghost shrimp in very shallow water on the East shore of
Holmes Harbor
on Whidbey Island, in the cove ½ mile north of Beverly Beach, about 5 miles north of Freeland. The whale was in water as shallow as 5', scooping up large divots of sand and filtering out the shrimp.

The Ocean Magic encountered
T14
, 'Pender' at
1.30pm
, near
Sheringham
light house. He was typically all alone and definitely heading out west this time. Last time I saw him on
April 10th he was keeping company with the T30's and T11's near Piers Island, Swartz Bay. It was so nice to see he had company at that time.

This morning our vessel "Fastcat" was half way between Race Rocks and Crescent Bay when Marine Naturalist, Rachel, spotted a large dorsal fin in the distance. We slowed down and after a few more surfacings soon realized we had found
T14
"Pender". During the 30 minutes we observed T14 he was zig-zagging across Juan De Fuca Strait and then suddenly made a number of sharp direction changes, possibly making a kill underwater of one of the Harbor Porpoise we had also seen in the area. We continued to
Crescent Bay
where we found a lone
Gray Whale
in resting mode logging at the surface. Yesterday, we also sighted a large Gray Whale a couple of miles south of Trial Island.

My name is Julius Budos and my wife's name is Judi Budos. After seeing
Gray whales
earlier in the day (see Gray whale report below) in Port Susan right off the shore of
Camano Island
, about a mile north of Tillicum Beach (about 2/3 of the way down the east side of Camano Ialand). My wife went down to the beach about

7:00pm
and said she saw about
5 orcas
.

We observed
J pod
making only clicks for almost 1.5 hours as they traveled northwestward from between
Matia and Orcas Islands
. Then they began milling and whistling intensely. They were again traveling northward slowly when we left them at 6 pm. Maybe listen to Orcasound tonight as they occasionally seemed to travel towards Boundary Pass.

Their dorsal fins and exhalations came into view just south of
Lummi Rocks
. We slowly approached seeing the tall dorsal with the unmistakable wavy trailing edge belonging to none other than Ruffles! Quickly I began searching out Granny and it was no surprise that Ruffles was being a "good son" on this beautiful Mother's Day staying very close to
J2
. Then a flash of the most beautiful orange caught my eye- it was little J45 surfacing by Samish and surrounded by the rest of their family (see photo on
Orca Network's Photo Page
)! I can't describe just how amazed I was to see the growth the youngster has gone through in the past few months. 11 year old Doublestuff (J34) is really coming into his own as well as Riptide (
J30
). Not to mention seeing Echo (
J42
) in contrast to the newest members of
J Pod
, to think she was that small only 2 years ago! I was able to identify a handful of K Pod whales that were amongst J Pod (Spock K20, Comet K38, and Scoter K25). There were others, but I was unable to get clear photos for identification.

Jeff Lamarche and I had
J's & K's
from
1600-1830
today heading NW up Rosario. After passing through Obstruction Pass, nearing Lawrence Pt (
Orcas Island
) we found out that J's & Ks turned around and headed NW rather than come down Rosario which is what they were doing previously. I left them 3 miles NW of Sucia Island at
1845
when the rain began.

The Beam Reach students were with
J pod
at

5:45 pm
, traveling north from between
Matia & Orcas Islands
. By

7:25 pm
they were west of
Patos Island
. You can read posts from the Beam Reach Marine & Sustainability School's Students on the Beam Reach website blog.

Mother's Day whales off west side
Lummi Island
right around
noon
! Looked to be
J pod
- a few small groups ambling pretty close to shore, with a baby tucked in close in one of the groups. Didn't see J1 - he may have been off by himself, farther out.

We got a report from Susan McLeod at

4:50 pm
, of
4-5 orcas
between
Salt Spring Island and North Pender Island
- out where the Swanson Channel and perhaps the Satellite Channel intersect - south of Beaver Point, Salt Spring Island. I do have a good spotting scope and am pretty sure that the male that I saw had a dorsal fin that was completely bent over at the top (it looked like it was rolled over).
Probably T40/Captain Hook - sb.

I just talked with Radar out of Victoria. He has
T14
("Pender") out by
Sheringham
now.

This is the first really good ID photograph of any of the whales that have been feeding off
West Beach
, NW Whidbey Island. This is a new & unusual place for us to have continual reports of
gray whales
feeding, and this ID shot will hopefully enable Cascadia Research to check their ID catalogs to see if it's one of the "regular" N. Puget Sound whales, or a newcomer that has found a new place to feed.
*
Not sure if this is a Gray or a Humpback (from the photos it is definitely a
gray
). I watched it feed for about an hour about 200 yards off Whidbey Island at Swan Lake at
West Beach
. It was moving back and forth parallel to the shore. This is the second time I've seen it there. Maybe you are able to recognize it by the coloring (see above photo & comment). Love your site.

At

2:30
today a
gray whale
passed by at
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
, traveling north. The whale was following/hugging the shoreline. As the whale passed by the light he/she went into the cove continuing north. I went up to Andrews Bay to see if I could spot the whale.The whale was still following/hugging the shoreline all the way through Andrews Bay, surfacing about at four different locations as he/she traveled on to the north. The last surfacing was just out of my sight - I only heard the blow. Very unusual for Haro Strait.

I was sitting out on the deck about
11 AM
and heard the unmistakeable "whoosh". A lone gray traveled quite rapidly SOUTH along the drop-off at
Mabana, SW Camano Isl
.
Barbara Brock, Camano Island

Sally Bigger called to report a
Gray whale
had passed
Beverly Beach
on the east side of
Holmes Harbor
at about

9:15 am
, heading out of the Harbor toward Baby Island. Her daughter heard a gray whale at about
9:15 am on
May 9th as well.

Veronica von Allworden was out taking some aerial photos of
Gray whale
feeding pits for our Gray whale feeding survey yesterday, and was surprised to find some feeding pits at the very end of Holmes Harbor, right off Freeland Park, downtown
Freeland
!
