Orca Sightings for January 16, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Ranger Kim at
Pt. Reyes Natl. Park, CA
reporting a pod of orcas passing by at approx.

12:15 pm
today. They were first observed from the Lighthouse - they were heading south, then north for awhile, then sort of meandering. There were at least 7 - 8, possibly more, including at least 1 adult male and 1 with a "chewed up" dorsal fin. They came within approx. 600 yds of the shore when swimming in the cove, but were also seen further out at times.
