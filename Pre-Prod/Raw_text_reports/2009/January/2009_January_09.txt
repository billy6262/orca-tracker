Orca Sightings for January 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately

4:15 p.m
. from the Island Packers whale watch boat out of Channel Islands Harbor in
Oxnard, California
. We saw several
Orca
including males on both sides of the boat traveling west along the south side of East Anacapa Island of the Channel Island chain at approximately 34 degrees N by 119 degrees W. The school of Orca were trailing a large school of several hundred common dolphin first sighted at approximately
4 p.m.
swimming west rapidly past both sides of our boat. The crew explained that they have seen Orca only once before in this area, and their presence could explain the absence of the gray whale they had sighted on their morning excursion to the same area that day.
