Orca Sightings for January 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call at
1245
today, from Kevin Jochem at the
Bremerton Naval shipyard
, relaying a report of what was believed to be
a small orca
(12 - 15') sighted between the piers at the shipyard at 9 am this morning.
Upon further checking with the Navy, we received a few more details:
I had my Watch Officer do some checking, earlier this morning there was a sighting of a small orca between Piers Four and Five (east side of SNS BRITTIN toward Bremerton). The orca was observed continuing to swim easterly toward Pier Six and on into the (Sinclair) inlet outside of the security barrier. No other sightings reported.
