Orca Sightings for January 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
A fairly large group (5-8) of
transients
came through
Active Pass
at

10:45 AM
. Moving south with the tide, the transients quickly came through the pass and then spent quite a bit of time at the mouth of Georgeson Bay, seemingly undecided as to whether to go north up Trincomali channel or south towards the San Juans. One whale spent over a minute just floating in the water, dorsal fin exposed, about 100 meters from Colinson Reef. After 15 minutes of hanging out, they decided to head south, and roared off in a flash.
