I didn't see them but my old neighbors on the North East side (Glen Acres) of Vashon saw Orcas going by today at approximately

4:15pm
- headed south towards Point Robinson lighthouse (Tacoma way). I was in Seattle for the day and I tried to look for them from Des Moines and Tacoma side and saw nothing.

Staci sent an update today saying she had heard a report at the same time of day about 1/2 mile down the beach (place called Dillworth) of Dall porpoises being sited, and thinks her old neighbors may have seen porpoises and mistook them for Orcas.
