Orca Sightings for February 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Something made me leave the conference yesterday and catch the
2:40 ferry back to San Juan Island. When I drove up the west side road around

4:00 pm
, I saw blows out in windy
Haro Strait
. They were from
resident killer whales
heading south in mid-strait. I snapped a couple of distant unidentifiable photos from shore (but one can see a resident group pattern) and dashed home to listen to the hydrophone. In the stormy noisy seas I heard what could have been one faint K call as the whales headed out into the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca. It was too rough and getting too dark to go out in a boat to try to confirm ID's.
