Orca Sightings for February 22, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I took over one hundred pictures of this
pod of orca
while they fed on a couple sea lions. The time was around

10:00am
. They started feeding in
Boundry Pass
just west of Waldron Is. I was impressed and happy to get the photos, which were approx. 3 miles away. Then they worked around to Sandy Point on Waldron.

I saw a large pod of
Orcas
in the Bay, off Point Grey, outside of
Vancouver Harbour
. I believe it was J pod with two calves, one very small still had the pink saddle patch. look like 12 to 15 animals.
