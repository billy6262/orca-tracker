Orca Sightings for February 27, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a
gray whale
, at

2:40pm
while riding the Washington State Ferry from
Clinton
to Mukilteo terminal. The whale appeared to be alone travelling north up Saratoga Passage towards Langley. I was able to see the fluke once in the sunshine and it had white spots/patches on the underside (
sounds like Patch-sb
). It was about two hundred yards from the starboard side of the ferry. I had binoculars with me in the car so was able to confirm my sighting.

Mac Shearer of Greenbank called at

9:30 am
to report seeing a
gray whale
blow mid-channel between
Camano Island
and Greenbank, Whidbey Island, and another blow 1/4 mile further SW. Sounds like the 2 grays seen later in the day further south in Saratoga Passage -

While crossing the

3:00
ferry, from Muk to
Clinton
, the captain told us there was a
Gray Whale
to the right. I saw one blow and it dived deep between both ferries about mid channel. Never saw it again.
