Entry 1:
ID confirmation from Cascadia Research on yesterday's grays: Yes this is

While surfing at Wickaninish Beach,
Tofino B.C
we saw a
gray whale
hanging out
all day
just beyond the 7-10ft waves. All that is visible in the photo is the blow in the distance. According to the Pachena lighthouse keeper, her first gray whale of the season was spotted off Pachena Point Friday, Feb.6.

A late breaking report of "very strange sounds on OrcaSound's Lime Kiln and Orca Sound
Hydrophones
at
1837
- are they Ts?? follow up at 1850: faint calls on Lime Kiln then switched to Orca Sound Hps. and the same call was repeated over and over - really loud. y the time I sent the prior post they had stopped. I learned that the Ts were coming back south a while ago and so that might very well have been them.

I got a call from Captain Ivan this
morning
that there were whales inbound at Victoria, and then it was confirmed as a very large group of
Transients
! I got another call that the whales were still around, actually just across Haro Strait near Gooch Island. So off we went to see if we would be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the whales. Suddenly about 800 yards ahead of us the water fairly burst with froth as 9 orcas came to the surface simultaneously! This group of Transients were heading north at a fairly fast 9-10 knot pace as they continued north. We didn't know where the other whales that had been sighted had gone off to, so finally around
4pm
we turned south to head home. Suddenly another group of
orcas
appeared ahead of us. Fortunately for us, this group (
T102
is the only one I can give an ID for) was south bound and led us down Sydney Island. We left the whales at the southern tip of Sydney still heading south.

Orca Network received reports from The Center for Whale Research & Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales, who were out with the whales, which turned out to be a very large group of
Transient orcas
. Mark said after they got the report from the Victoria Clipper, they found the whales off the south end of Trial Island near
Victoria
, & tentatively ID'd them as the
T87's
, T100's,
T101's
, and the
T124's
.
*
They fanned out into 3 groups and headed up
Haro Strait
moving fast. More IDs & info: Mallard and I figured out that we had a total of 19 whales around today from the T87's, T90's, T100's, T101's, T124's, and T124A's. We got on them near Beaumont Shoals around 1235 and left them just north of Kelp Reef at about 1350.

Jeff Lamarche of Seafun Safaris got a report from Jim on the Clipper IV of
5-8 Orcas
Eastbound approx. 1.3 nm straight off
Clover Pt
. The whales were grouped up tightly and headed for Trial Island at

10:22am
.
*
We spent the afternoon with about
20 Transients
, the mammal eating Orcas, and with a Steller Sea Lion that was using our boat to escape the Orcas, who had been tormenting him.

Orca
sounds were heard near Vancouver this afternoon, perhaps Js, which bodes well for tomorrow.

Veronica von Allworden of Langley called Orca Network at

10:30 am
to report a
gray whale
off Camano Head, Camano Island. She was going up flying, & was able to get a better look & take some photos - she updated us at

12:45 pm
to say there were
two grays
, and one of them was
Patch
, one of our favorite Saratoga "regulars"!
*
Captain Carl & Captain Michael just called from onboard the Island Explorer 3 that they are with a
Gray Whale
at
Camano Head
! During the reposition of the boat to Everett for our Gray Whale Program, the huge exhalation of a Gray Whale was spotted from the bridge!!
