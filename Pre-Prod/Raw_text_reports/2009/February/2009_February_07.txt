Orca Sightings for February 7, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just letting you know I was fortunate enough to go out with Radar on a Prince of Whales boat in the
afternoon
and we ended up picking up a group of
transients
at
Sheringham Point
. It was a great sighting - saw them kill at least 2 steller sea lions. Lots of cartwheels and lunges. Looks like it was the
T41s and T109s
but I've got to get confirmation from my photos. We watched them from around
1500
for about 45 minutes and they spent the entire time near the lighthouse at Sheringham Pt. They had no direction of travel when we left them but Shamus was out on another Prince of Whales boat (and helped us find them!) and apparently they were joined by more transients after we left.

When I returned to work today, two of the people I work with had gone surfing over the weekend. They were surfing at
Crescent Bay
which is west of
Port Angeles
. On Saturday around

1:30 - 2pm
they saw a handful of Orcas offshore, including one large male. This would jive with the sightings off of Victoria the day before. This is second hand information, but please post if you like.

Late afternoon
we saw
J's L's and probably K's
extremely spread out between Entrance Island and Silva Bay outside
Gabriola Island, B.C.
Canada.
