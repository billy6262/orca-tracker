I was on my deck Saturday night about

11:30 pm
and heard the blowing of a
[gray] whale
on the
Greenbank
shores.

While staffing our display at the Mussel Festival in Coupeville yesterday, we met Steve Daily, who reported seeing a
gray whale
from the
Mukilteo Clinton ferry
at

1:30 pm
on his way to Whidbey. He said the whale was closer to the Clinton/Whidbey Island side of the sound.

This morning at

8:50 AM
, we watched
2 gray whales
off the shore swimming towards
Langley
. It was very wavy and windy. Both whales started spy hopping not sticking their heads out real high but angled into the wind! I got my camera and took some shots as they headed away (see photo above!). One of the whales looks like ID #531. I'm not sure about the other one. One of the pictures is a partial fluke and that might be ID# 383.

And ID's from Cascadia Research, of photos from Veronica von Allworden from
March 7th off Langley, Whidbey Island: Jessie and I looked at the photographs and
ID#531
is the fluke (see photo below) and good IDs. We suspect the other animal is #53 but we did not feel certain enough of this to make a definite determination. Thanks for sending these on.
