We finally got to see
some grays
today! While walking Sweet Pea around the neighborhood, I took a peek over the edge of the bluff north of
Greenbank
, & instantly saw a spout & at least 1 gray (possibly 2?) below, feeding close to shore at
5 pm
. One small boat was drifting along nearby watching, & it appeared the whale was heading south. So we went home for binocs & camera, & received a call there were also 2 whales south of us. We headed out to our neighbor's bluff - unfortunately the whale I saw earlier must have turned back north as it was nowhere to be found, but we did finally spot 2 whales across the entrance to Holmes Harbor, just north of Baby Island at 6 pm. It appeared they were feeding close to shore, difficult to determine direction of travel.

4:51 pm
to report
2 gray whales
close to the Whidbey Island side of
