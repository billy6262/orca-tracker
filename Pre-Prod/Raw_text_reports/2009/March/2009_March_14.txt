============================================================

5:25 PM.

The Island Explorer 3 was heading northbound up
Saratoga Passage
when we spotted a couple of blows off in the distance! Their blows were only lingering moments before the wind flattened them down, giving us just enough to spot them from a couple of miles away! We found
#53 & #531
swimming side-by-side heading south with consistent respirations that produced a few great opportunities to capture that quintessential Gray Whale fluking photo!! A couple of interns from Cascadia Research were on board allowing them to practice identification and gather some great data on these two beautiful giants!

Camano Isl

10:00am
- I just spotted
two grays
feeding in shallow water north of Kayak Point, northeast part of Port Susan, east side of
Camano Island
. I've been reading reports of them in the Camano Head area and waiting to see them up here.

We've been watching our first
Grays
of the season for the past 45 minutes (from

9:35 -
10:20 am
). There are
two
, one of them a calf, feeding back and forth in Elger Bay. They then headed towards deeper water out past the shelf in the bay in a south westerly direction.

Around
seven fifteen pm
while grilling outside to report several
very loud blows in Saratoga passage
, very close in shore. He said he would hear several frequent blows and then long pauses inbetween, so I assumed they were down there sifting out shrimp.

I received a call from my son on the sv Nelle Bly. While under sail at

1:05 PM
off of the NE end of Clements Reef, between
Patos and Sucia Islands
they were overtaken by two adult
Orcas
and a tiny calf. The mom and calf passed very close to them and they estimated the calf to be apx 4-6' in length. The other Orca was a bit further away so they were not able to closely observe it. The Mom and baby were porpoising, coming quite far out of the water several times and moving very rapidly in an easterly direction.
