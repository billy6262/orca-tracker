Orca Sightings for March 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
L-Pod was spotted off Monterey on Thursday,
March 5. I spoke to Richard Ternullo, who confirmed that he had observed L-Pod in Monterey. He spotted them around
noon
, spread out over 4 miles. He watched them for about 45 minutes, at which time they gathered in a tight group and headed west at about 8-9 knots.

I was out on the Ocean Magic today and 'Magically'
two orca
surfaced in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, east of
Race Rocks
between
1-3pm
. We soon were able to identify these two as
Transients
,
T20 and T21
. They didn't appear to be actively hunting , just cruising along in a zig-zag fashion. We left them heading farther east.
