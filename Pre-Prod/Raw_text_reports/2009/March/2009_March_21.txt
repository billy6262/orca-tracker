Orca Sightings for March 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
There was a small
gray whale
lazing about in the bay between Tongue Point and the mouth of Salt Creek on the
Straits of Juan de Fuca
. We observed the whale for at least an hour between
1700 and 1800
. It sounded slowly making several passes thru the area just outside the kelp line on the south side of the point. We never saw tail flukes, but it raised its barnacle-encrusted head once to look around.

Two
gray whales
were sighted off
Polnell Point
, Whidbey Island making their way toward Mariners Cove. Photos taken at
10AM
, from the Polnell Shores community beach area.

In
Mukilteo
, we noticed a whale heading north. It seemed to be playing. It would occassionally come to the surface and we could see it blowing water from it's blow hole.

Edith Bryan called to report
2 gray whales

Greenbank
) heading SE at

5:15 pm
.
*
Barb Jaksa saw
3 gray whales
in
Possession Sound
from the
4 pm
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry.
*
We saw a marine mammal spout about three times within a five minute period. It was a single animal with a pronounced spout visible from a quarter mile or so away. We did see its back as it sounded and there was no dorsal, so my guess is that it was a
gray whale
rather than a minke or orca.

3:10 PM
, about one quarter mile offshore, just North of Pt. Partridge buoy, and heading North.

2 pm
,
three adult gray whales
are swimming to the north around Possession Point and up the east side of Whidbey. Also a 4th gray just off Picnic Point.

[More Mariners Cove Gray Activity] At

10:30 AM
a
gray
was right out in front. Next 5 minutes or so we saw nothing. Then, farther out, about 100 yards, two spouts.
Two grays
appeared. Stayed for a few minutes, as they were only passing through. Neighbor who had informed us of grays, had first noticed one coming from the southwest close into shore, so they had turned around and now, were heading south towards Rocky Point (Camano). They stopped 1/4 mile from shore off, Camp Grande, near Rocky Point. Localized spouting for about 15 minutes. Then, spouts continued south possibly towards Harrington/Race Lagoons south of Coupeville.

While making coffee this morning at
ten am
, I stuck my ear next to the open window "just to check", as I do every morning, to see if I heard whales, and I heard blows!
Two grays
were coasting North, slowly, close to shore by our house near
Polnell Heights
; then they turned around near the Mariner's Cove community and headed back South mid-channel, picking up speed.

Just spent 45 minutes (
~9-
9:45 am
) watching
two gray whales
on the east side of Polnell Point (5 miles east of Oak Harbor). They are within 100 feet of the shoreline.

I spotted
two whales
trolling ~

7:45 AM
this morning in
Langley
harbor; one much larger than the other; I don't know if the smaller of the two was a "baby," as this was my 1st whale sighting and I'm completely ignorant or their biology. The smaller of the two surfaced every 30 seconds or so, while the larger one, trailing behind, only surfaced once during the 10 minutes I watched.
Croft, Langley, Whidbey Island

I just saw gray whales off of
NW Langley
about an hour ago (
6 am
). Now, at
7:00 AM there is
one gray whale
feeding in the shallow water NW of Langley. It is really foggy out and I can't tell if this is one of the earlier whales or not.

Orca Network received a message at

5:50 pm
, no name or phone number given, reporting
2-3 orcas
off
Hwy 1
at Power pole # ?6, a few miles from the Lighthouse. They were looking at one of the Center for Whale Research's posters with our number on it, but Ken said there are several Lighthouses on the CA coast where he posted signs on poles, so we unfortunately have no further clue as to where this was.
