Orca Sightings for March 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted a geyser/plume of an exhaling whale from the
4:30 run of the
Edmonds to Kingston Ferry
, to the south of the ferry route, near President Point/Appletree Cove, at

4:45 pm
.

We were walking the dog on the beach at
Greenbank
this evening, & brought along binocs just in case. We happened to see 1
gray whale
spout in the distance at

5:35 pm
, somewhere off the tip of East Pt/Fox Spit. We watched for more spouts until dark, & never saw any, so our guess is it was heading south & went around the spit & out of sight.

Captain Carl on Island Explorer 3 spotted
2 Gray Whales
, just south of
Camano head
, this
afternoon
. It was so beautiful and calm, he saw them from the boat while tied to the dock!

This morning at

3:00 AM to
3:30 AM
I could hear a
gray whale
splashing and breathing as it fed along the beach
NW of Langley
. Today there are fresh whale pits on the beach.
