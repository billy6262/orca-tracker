Orca Sightings for March 15, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just had 8 to 10
orcas
pass our house (
7pm
) one single male two calves and some females maybe J pod to far to ID. They were having a great time frolicking in the waves. Heading south on the north side of Hornby Island BC. We have just had our annual herring spawn, possible food source for them? Have had reports of Orca sightings for the past three weeks around Hornby.

Two gray whales
swimming SE along
Langley's
waterfront. I saw them about
3 p.m.
heading past Seawall Park going toward the marina. I could actually see their huge bodies just under the water's surface from way up here on 6th St.
