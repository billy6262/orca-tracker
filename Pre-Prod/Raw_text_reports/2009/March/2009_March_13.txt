Orca Sightings for March 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Malleson spotted splashing and fins offshore of
Ten Mile Point
, Vancouver Island (Gulf Islands, south of Nanaimo) at
1015 AM
and notified me that it looked like
Transient killer whales
beating up on something in Haro Strait. I cast off from Oak Bay in "Orca" at 1043, and found the whales near Fulford Reef at 1058 still beating up an animal that was an adult male Steller Sea Lion weighing approximately one ton. The
T100's, T101's and T124's
were explosively ramming and tossing the sea lion into the air, while adult male
T102
and sub-adult male
T97
circled in the background. The whales were being very careful to avoid being bitten or slashed by the canine teeth of the sea lion, and were mostly hitting it from behind or below. At
1140
it was all over for the sea lion and the young whales began breaching while the adult females submerged for minutes at a time. The males appeared to be involved in sex play, and the gulls swirled and dove for sea lion scraps. I left them south of Discovery Island at 48 degrees 23.42 minutes N by 123 degrees 12.2 minutes W in a sloppy ebbing tide.

I was lucky to be out on this special day, for it was an awesome day with a group of
transients
. These animals were spotted north east of Ten Mile Point by Mark 'Mallard' of Prince of Whales, who was on shore earlier at
10.30 am
. They appeared to be hunting a sea lion. We later found them again on the 1pm Zodiac trip south of Sea Bird lighthouse. They were very active and appeared to be cleaning up a kill as were the gulls all around us. The transient identity by Mark and Ken Balcomb who was also out on the water, were the
T100, B, C + D. T101, A + B, and T102
.

T101s & T102

One
gray
heard my wishes/desires this evening at dusk. Was feeding a squirrel around

7:15PM
and was going inside when I heard familiar spout. Turned around and saw single gray very close into shore. After another spout, swirling/swishing started, dinner was on. Walked along the beach until dark; as gray slowly headed southwest towards
Polnell Point
in north Saratoga/Skagit Bay. Feeding, steadily along the way. Any regulations about 'walking' too close to whales along the beach? I was walking well under 7 knots. Cheers,

We had at least
three Grays
at
Bell's Beach
at

6:15pm
: 2 adults and possibly a calf swimming very tight side-by- side. They came across the passage towards Bells Beach directly infront of us then turned to head S. towards Langley. Despite fluking (only two flukes- again possibly indicating the third may have been a calf), they were never down more than a few min. Usually when we see a fluke they are down longer. Three spouts were always within a second of each other - 1,2,3. At one point we thought there was a fourth adult following about 50' away, but maybe an adult circled around. I know Patch has been hanging with just one other- so either more Grays have arrived, or there's a "new arrival" Gray.

According to Cascadia Research & photo ID's, there are at least 5 different gray whales identified in Saratoga Passage so far this season - sb
