Orca Sightings for March 3, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
L pod
was last seen up this way in Puget Sound on 20 February, and then they raced the eight hundred miles down the coast to be seen on 3 March by Richard Ternullo of
Monterey Bay
Whale Watch. In this photograph, L pod seems to be racing back to the north with Moss Landing in the background. In this photo we can identify
L25, L47, L54, L84, and L100
.

Thanks to a call from Jeanne Hyde, Dave Ellifrit, John Durban and I got out with
J pod
in
Haro Strait
just before sunset and confirmed that there are now
TWO new babies in J pod: J44 with J17 and J45 with J14
. Both babies appeared to be in good condition and energetic. In this photo, J45 is in foreground, next J14, and J1 is in background.

I just spotted two
gray whales
already past my house, headed for
Langley
and continuing to the SE. They were close to shore but I could not tell if they were feeding or not. The tide is a ways out and they were near the drop off. I did watch both both whales do a deep dive and saw the knuckles and fluke. The only thing I could tell for sure was that neither of them was "Patch".
