Around

3:00pm
we saw one female
Gray
and her recent newborn swimming north between Possession Point and the Mukilteo shipwreck. Taking their time and staying on the surface. We watched them for about 45 minutes. We saw two other spouts in the distance but were unable to identify them.

It's very difficult to determine the gender of gray whales (unless they roll over), and the grays that visit this area typically are males or whales that don't have calves with them, though that can always change! We have had one whale in the past that is smaller than the others, with a smaller spout, that looks like a calf but is just a smaller adult. With photos, Cascadia Research can verify if there are any mom/calf pairs present this year, so send us photos if you see this pair - thanks! sb

2 gray whales
were feeding in the shallow water NW of
Langley
. They then swam out and back again and fed more in front of Langley. The whale bell was rung and it sounded like a number of people saw the whales that continued to work their way to the southeast.

0715
Bells Beach (N. of
Langley
, Whidbey Isl). Watched
two beautiful grays
for 15 min+ eating their breakfast while I ate mine. Their satisfied baritone blows vibrated through the brisk dawn air, settling in my chest. Some deep knowing, recognition fills me with calm... What a gift! I love living here!
