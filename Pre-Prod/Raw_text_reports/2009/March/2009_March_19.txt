Orca Sightings for March 19, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky enough to be out on Mark's 'Mallards' Zodiac again yesterday with POW and we encountered the
T30s
east of
Race Rocks
along with another female, thought to be,
T172
. They were generally enjoying the calm seas and favourable weather with a little foraging on the side. Although we believe they were after a seal we never saw any remains of the prey item. The youngster T30C seems to be a male as he was easily sexed when waving his fluke high out of the water.

Amy Carey called to relay a report from Argossy Tours of Seattle - they were anchored off Alki Pt. with a group of students and saw the orcas (
J pod
) head by going north across
Elliott Bay
at

11:15 am
.
*

11:58 pm
. Just started hearing lots of
J pod
calls on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
. Seems like they may be getting closer... Will post recording to OrcaSound once they pass.

I finally saw some fins at

7:30 pm
, just as it was starting to get dark. They were just coming into view from the south of
Bush Pt, Whidbey Island
. All I saw was a very tight group of fins-no backs, just fins sticking out of the water, very close together. Probably four or five. They were moving slowly and were pretty close to our side. I never saw more than that, altho I kept looking till dark.
Elsa Leavitt, Whidbey Island

I saw the
orcas
heading north past Hansville at around

5:20 pm
. They were mid- channel and moving at quite a clip. I cropped the images but if you zoom in the big male fin has some pretty distinctive markings (definitely J1/Ruffles!) . Looked like 3 whales traveling together.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries said they caught up to
J pod
at

2:30 pm
, off
Kingston
, just west of mid-channel. They were slowly heading north. They followed them to just south of Pt. No Point at

4:30 pm
but had to head back in due to high winds. They reported all J pod members present, and that they were successful in collecting 1 fecal sample.

Lori Robinson called at

1:25 pm
to report
orcas
south of
Port Madison
, heading
north
.
*
Two
pods
heading southward off Rolling Bay/Skiff Point on
Bainbridge Island
,

8:15am
. At least two males close in shore, feeding.

Mark Malleson of Victoria called to report Transient
orcas T30, T30A,B & C, & T172
east of
Race Rocks
heading west at
1530
. Observed one seal kill.

There is a
gray
back in
Elger Bay
-

1:57 pm
. Dale Wagner, Camano Island

Richard Kell of
Camano Island
called at

12:50 pm
to report 1
gray whale
in Elger Bay. There were 2 grays there
March 18th, and almost every day for the past week.
*
The Island Explorer 3 first found
Gray Whale #356
just west of Gedney Island moving slowly at around

11:30 am
- there abouts! Due to the whale simply sinking back into the water it was quite the challenge to get an ID, but patience paid off in the end! After leaving for a spell to check out some Bald Eagles we ventured back to find
Gray Whale #383
moving from the Snohomish River Delta toward the south end of Gedney Island! This is the same whale that last April spy-hopped 7 consecutive times!!

Orca Network received a call from the Ferry Kitsap at

10:50 am
, reporting a pod of
orcas
1 mile off
Alki Pt
, between Alki & Restoration Pts, near the Tango Buoy, heading south.
*
We are watching what looks like 4
Orcas
in a line between Rolling Bay, Bainbridge Island and Carkeek Park,
Seattle
. They are close to the south bound shipping lane heading
south
. Looks like one male, two females and not sure about the 4th one. Saw the first one at
8am
.
UPDATE

8:30am
: The four came in by Skiff Point,
Bainbridge Island
still heading
south
. A mother and a juvenile are also out in the south bound shipping lane off of West Point. The juvenile is particularly frisky - jumping clear out of the water.

9:00am
: One, possibly two
grays
in Port Susan (east side of
Camano Island
) out in the middle of the bay, moving south. Long intervals between blows.
Gary Lingenfelter, Kayak Point

8:30 am
: There is one smaller
gray whale
playing/feeding about 100 yards off shore just north of the
Mukilteo
ship wreck.

Two
grays
have been feeding in
Elger Bay
since dark this morning. They are over on the west side of the bay now (

8:25 am
) and too far for pictures.
