Orca Sightings for March 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon was a "Welcome the Whales" ceremony at La Push on the Quileute Reservation. There were
gray whales
off of First Beach for most of the ceremony. Two maybe, maybe more......The kids came ashore. And exactly then, about

2:30 PM
, a pod of
orcas
appeared. I was too excited to get the binoculars or camera pointed at them, or count them, or do anything useful; but my first impression when they were closest was that the dorsals looked like transients.

Update: Looked in the camera this morning, and found that I actually accidentally got a tiny bit of a picture of them. Useless for ID, but they are at least evidence that it really happened. Even the Quileutes and visiting members of tribes to the north were amazed that there were orca. Not normal for First Beach.

This will be my first attempt to put into words what it was like to be in attendance at the Quileute Tribe's second Whale Welcoming Ceremony yesterday. Hundreds of humans and numerous
gray whales
gathered at the mouth of the Quileute River in a wondrous display of tribal regalia and ritual, and cetacean frolicking and feasting. There were prayers, songs and dances that were answered with spyhops, rolling backs and waving fins. Most of the humans were from visiting tribes...standing awestruck in their beautiful capes, watching the grays gathered close to shore. The Quileute Whale Callers, three men in cedar bark hats and capes, recreated for a new generation a very serious rattle chant...walking slowly toward the water...calling to the whales. The Quileute children did many dances, the descendants of the whaling families were honored, a new whale/man mask and dance had their spellbinding debut, stories were told, neighboring tribes were thanked. The final part of the ceremony was this: two young teenage boys pulled a small raft made of sticks , covered with cedar boughs, down to the beach. A salmon was placed on the cedar and the boys, encouraged by the crowd, pulled the little gift of food out into the gentle surf. As the raft floated on it's own, riding the little swells out into the bay, I kid you not:
THREE ORCA DORSAL FINS
BROKE THE SURFACE STRAIGHT OUT FROM THE RAFT!! The crowd had its' collective mind blown! The grays were still close in, stage left, while the raft floated straight out toward what seemed to be a large male dorsal fin in a tight group with at least two smaller dorsals fins showing. I was juggling three cameras...one digital, and two that need the film developed. I can let you know if I caught the orcas and the salmon gift...I may have. Still in a state of magic- hangover.....

Lucky to be out once again with Mark Malleson, to encounter
6 Transients
south of
Trial Island
on the way toward Discovery Island, between
3-4pm
, The
T10's
were ID'd by Mark . The bull was travelling with three 'exotics '...not sure who they were at this time. Possibly, T10 and T10C were seen farther off by themselves.

5:45-

6:30
- 2 miles southeast of
Kelp Reef, Haro Strait
. I saw a splash way in the distance over toward Kelp Reef. Sure enough it was the wayward
Transients
. They had made a kill and were very active. We left them at

6:00
two miles southeast of Kelp.

T26's
and the
T10's
south of
Discovery Island
this
afternoon
heading north for Haro Strait.

I went out to the edge of our bluff after dinner just in time to watch 2, possibly 3
gray whales
dining in the shallows just south of the Mabana Rd. Lots of flukes and fins. They had already passed us by unobserved as they were so close to shore. Lots of seagulls feeding on the left overs. There had also been at least one gray mid channel towards Langley around the middle of the day.

Our encounter with
L pod
off
Westport
today: Spent entire day with them as they were heading south - left them off Long Beach - too far inshore to take the Mac II at night so will have to try to relocate in AM.

3:30 am
-
L pod
off
Grays Harbor WA
. We found L pod on the 4th day at sea!!! The NOAA ship, McArthur II ran into all of L pod just north of Grays Harbor WA. in the middle of the night last night (~
0330
). We lost them acoustically but then found them visually and acoustically in the mid morning and were able to deploy the small boat (RHIB). The whales were spread out and traveling south most of the day. Brad and the rest of the crew got photo IDs and some prey samples, stayed with them day until
1830
. Last visual sighting was at dusk when they grouped back up and became quiet. Hopefully we will stick with them through the night to get more samples tomorrow.
