============================================================

Happy to report our first

Camano Island
. Just cruising, lots of spouts, headed SW towards the Greenbank area.

A kind neighbor called with the news last night, today we checked for ourselves: it sure seems early, but at least
two grays
are feeding in
Clallam County's Crescent Bay
, west of the Elwha River. A large white-faced whale was easily seen in an aerial-type view from a bluff at Salt Creek County Park. Very near shore in the shallow east side of the bay. A blow could be simultaneously seen on the west side of the bay. The white-faced whale had almost no barnacles in the dorsal hump area , but a white patch on each side of the top surface of tail flukes, and heavily barnacled blowhole area. First gray whales of the year for us!

today southwest of Polnell Point (
NE Whidbey Isl
), from a Crescent Bay beach. Spouts appeared localized for about 45 minutes. Drove to a bay just northeast of Polnell Point and at

5:15PM
; same
gray

This morning at

6:20 AM
we listened to a
[gray] whale
feeding close to shore northwest of
Langley
. It only stayed for about 10 minutes before heading off. It was still to dark to see which direction it went in.
