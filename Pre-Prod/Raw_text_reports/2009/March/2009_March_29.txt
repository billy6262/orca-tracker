Orca Sightings for March 29, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Patty and I sailed up to
Langley
over last weekend, and had the joy of seeing 3, perhaps juvenile,
gray whales
feeding just off the water front park. A high school senior had recently installed a "whale bell" in town as a senior project, and it was happily ringing away.

This evening at

5:15 PM
we spotted several
gray whales
(looked like three whales), were near
Camano
island, first heading NW and then changing direction and heading SE and closer to Whidbey Island. At

6:45 PM
three whales came from the NW and were feeding in the shallow water in front of our house moving onto downtown Langley at about
7:10 PM.

Nancy Nolan called at

6:50 pm
to report
1 Gray whale
near Baby Island (
Holmes Hbr/Saratoga Psg
) heading east, and another heading south 10 minutes earlier.
*
Fred Lundahl of
Langley
called with an ecstatic report of
3 Gray whales
feeding off the
Langley
waterfront at

6:45 pm
. He said the whales were side by side, all entwined with each other, a few hundred feet from shore. They rang the Langley Whale Bell, and 100 people came to the park to watch this magical experience! The whales fed for 15 minutes in front of the Dog House, then headed south, mid-channel, coming back to feed again in front of Boy & Dog Park.
*
You are probably getting constant whale reports now (yup!).
Gray whale
headed south east about 1/2 mile NE from Baby Island. Seems like it is headed towards beach between Baby Island and East Point.

We observed
a gray whale
feeding??, or just swimming along having fun, in
Holmes Harbor
. It was going along the eastern shore, near the northern end of Holmes harbor, but seen south of Baby Island. The first was mid- day
12 to 1 pm
, (reported by the neighbors) the second sighting was around 6 pm. They may or may not be the same whale. The
6 pm
whale came into the harbor a-ways along this shore, then went out again, so we got to see it pass by twice.

The sun was just right to be able to watch lots of spouts from
two grays
as they worked their way from Bells Beach to south of
Langley
, from roughly
4PM to
5:30 PM
.
Barbara Brock, Mabana, Camano Island
*
Watched
1 Gray whale
at

2:30 pm
, moving very slow through the water at the edge of a shallow / drop off heading north along the east side of
Holmes Harbor
towards Baby Island (48 5'6" N 122 31'16"W).

After we saw the
T30s and T49s
this afternoon we decided to check out the seals and birds in the Chain Islands in Oak Bay and ended up seeing
T14
heading past the islands on the west side of Chatham Island and then N up Haro Strait from Baynes Channel. We watched him from about
1500 to 1530
.

2 gray whales
in Saratoga Passage between at Bells Beach, north of
Langley
, and Camano Island, closer to the Camano side heading north.
*
One gray
1/2 mile off west point at
Deception pass
in about 175 of water for at least six hours.

Just in from a great trip on the water with Mark Malleson. So nice to be in the sunshine for a change! We encountered
9, possibly 10 Transients
between
2-3pm
. Certainly the
T49A's
and the
T30's
were ID'd by Mark, and were seen frolicking around together. We came across them 5 miles south of
Trial Island
and they certainly were very happy Orcas. We saw lots of happy behaviours , including fluke lobs, breaching, cartwheels and spyhops. They even motored over to us at one point and some of the animals disappeared beneath us.

Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called at

2:15 pm
to report the
Transients
were 5 miles south of
Trial Island
near Victoria, heading north slowly. There are 9 of them, identified as the
T30's and T49A's
.
*
Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales called to report hearing faint
Transient
calls on the
hydrophones
, and sighting a pod of Transients from shore about 5 miles south of Trial Island at

10:30 am
- there appear to be 6 or 8 of them.

I am hearing
Transients
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone's
right now.....

Barbara Ellingsen
1220 pm
- hearing same faint calls again on
Lime Kiln Hydrophones
, just like earlier today. it was reported to me by Jim Maya that there were
Transients
about 3 to 4 miles south of Trial Island.
and an update: That previous alert was from a sighting of the Ts at about
11:30, so sounds like they have moved back up a bit. I had heard them at

and another update: As reported by Scott Viers, the transient calls were made from 25 km away from the Lime Kiln hydrophones, establishing a new long distance record for detection of orca calls.
