Lori Willson called at

2:20 pm
to say her daughter spotted the
orcas
mid-channel of
Alki
, heading north. She was heading out to find them as well, and sent this update: I was able to watch that small group off Alki Point for 30 min or so before I had to pull myself away. They were just kind of milling about in a slow northerly direction. Lots of tail slapping going on. A couple of research boats were out there with them. They sure were drawing a crowd down to Alki Point. Everybody was so excited! I noticed one large male in the group. I also saw some very cute, tiny little exhalations from a calf.

Our Eagle Eyed Captain, Trev, sighted the first
Humpback
about 3 miles East of
Race Rocks
. This is the full grown adult female Humpback Whale we believe is the mother of the 3 year old known as "Split Fin" or Bart". After watching the Humpback for a while we left to go towards Race Rocks as another boat arrived on scene. At Race Rocks we saw several hundred California and Steller Sealions both in the water and on the rocks. We then headed back towards Constance Bank and came across a large group of very playful Dall's Porpoise who immediately started playing in the bow wave of our boat. We spotted a number of Steller Sealions playing in the water and stopped to investigate. As we were watching the Sealions check out our boat suddenly the Humpback we had found earlier surfaced nearby and this time "Split Fin" was also there. The 2 Humpback Whales were trumpeting and splashing the water with their tales at two Sealions that were following closely. We then saw a terrific Cartwheel by the large Humpback Whale. "Split Fin" was also being very playful and was seen waving his large Pectoral Fin in the air. We were just south west of Constance Bank when we encountered these two Humpback Whales and it is amazing these wonderful encounters happen so close to Victoria!
