Orca Sightings for October 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
J & K
pods had just passed
Lime Kiln
heading south. The whales had continued south and we soon found them out past
Salmon Bank
. They were very spread out and appeared to be foraging. We saw K12 with K37, then K16 with K35, then had a nice pass of K14 and 3 offspring which includes K26, K36 and K42. I could also see J1 and J27 much closer to shore. As the sun glistened on the water there seemed to whales in all directions off in the distance. It appeared that J's were grouping up near
False Bay
slowly heading up the island. Then!!!!!!! we got news that 15-20 Orcas had been spotted in San Juan Channel heading south. It was the group of
L pod
that had been spotted up in Blackfish Sound a few days ago. They were traveling in a tight group which included the L43's, L4's, L21's and L'26's. L92-Crewser was in the lead with a few other whales. He rolled over to show us his Sea Snake, and seemed to be a busy guy.

Marty, Kim, Mariah, Judy, Monem, Dean and I went out with Jim Maya off San Juan Island and saw lots of
orca
, as well as impressive Stellers (see photo of the day, above). We did see Ruffles and Granny, said Jim.

A group of
Orca
whales steamed past on the west side of
Orcas Island
along Spring Passage (the passage between Orcas Island and Jones Island). It is extremely rare for us to see whales through this channel (hasn't happened since I've lived here). The water was calm, and the sound of the blows was breathtaking. I could count seven simultaneous dorsal fins plus blows, but don't know the total count of whales. It happened fast, and I grabbed my camera, but didn't have the zoom lens on, so only got one shot, from Spring Point on Orcas Island, with Jones Island in the background. The whales headed out north of Yellow Island and then out into San Juan Channel. Based on your report of yesterday, I'd assume this was the L-pod subgroup.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called with a report of
J & K pods
off
Eagle Pt, W. San Juan Island
, heading SE at

11:54 am
. At around
3 pm
, the sub pod of
L's
that had been reported in Blackfish Sound Oct. 3rd came down San Juan Channel, while J's were off Salmon Bank.

Orca Network received a call from Mike, reporting a juvenile
orca
(~12 - 16'), 5.7 miles west of the
Pt. Wilson Light
(48 10.2 N; 122 54.05 W) at around 5 pm. It was heading west.
We received the following response to a report from Mike of "a juvenile orca (~12 - 16'), 5.7 miles west of the Pt. Wilson Light at 5 pm Oct. 6" - perhaps it was a Minke? sb
There is a juvenile
minke
that we've seen with its mother throughout the eastern strait this summer. About three or four weeks ago we started to notice it swimming on its own, mostly
between Partridge Bank and Admiralty Head
. I'd bet $5 that is what Mike saw; it has a rather short body length to its dorsal fin height, so it could easily be mistaken for a killer whale.

Calls
, clicks, and whistles on the (OrcaSound.net)
Lime Kiln hydrophone
now at
0955
, getting more intense since 0950. They made it from Orcasound to Lime Kiln (traveling south) in less than ~45 minutes.

It is
9.30 am
and I can hear high pitch whistles and lots of echolocation clicks on the
Hydrophones at Lime kiln
right now. Good to hear once again.
