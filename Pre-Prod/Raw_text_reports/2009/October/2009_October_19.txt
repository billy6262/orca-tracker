Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported
J pod

Orca Network received a call from Susan Clines, reporting one
gray whale
at the outer edge of the kelp beds off West Beach Rd, near Ft. Nugent Rd, (
NW Whidbey Island
) at
10 am
.
*
The Ocean Magic at
12.15pm
picked up two
Transient Orca
whose ID were T87, the male and T88, the female. They were spotted east of
Race Rocks
and south of Victoria near
Constance Bank
. They had just made a kill before we arrived so we didn't see any real aggressive foraging behaviours while were with them. They were milling around for a while with fairly long dives and then they headed west toward Race Rocks.
