Orca Sightings for October 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
A friend and I were on the bluff of Fort Ebey State Park overlooking
Admiralty Inlet
and the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca around
noon
. We saw disturbed water and with binoculars saw it was a group of
orca
heading south toward Puget Sound. We watched them for about 20 minutes. We observed one slap its tail. The orcas came into view from the north and we were able to count 8 we thought, one a large male, looked like some small ones with mothers, maybe one a younger male with smaller fin. A small boat was motoring toward the island and stopped to allow the pod to cross in front of him, very close. The orcas passed leisurely on a diagonal path towards Pt Townsend so we had many chances to see them and try counting. It seemed that the main group of perhaps 8 was accompanied by two groups at a short distance: a trio and another quartet of various sizes, the quartet including a male, possibly both smaller groups had males. All told we estimated up to 11-16 orca. Any idea which pod this would be?

This was K & L pods - J pod had gone into Puget Sound about an hour or so before - sb.

Jami Nagel, Naturalist with Island Adventures Cruises, took a photograph off Port Towensend, of the calf traveling with L94 (female, 14 yrs.) and L41 (male, 32 yrs.). Until further documentation, the identity of the mother is unsure.

30?
Orcas
seen at 47 degrees 46.061 min N; 122 degrees 26.503 min W (Richmond Beach, south of
Edmonds
) traveling South at

6:30 PM
(see photo of the day, above). Just transiting for the most part and blowing. However, one adult jumped vertically into the air full body out of water and then a calf followed suit and copied the action. There were a mix of male and female and young ones. Regards,

At

5:00 p.m.
, we watched with excitement a large group of
orcas
(even saw a baby) traveling south spread out across the water from
Richmond Beach
to Jefferson Head.

John Herman called at

6:15 pm
to say he was watching what is likely the last group of
orcas
heading south between
Skunk Bay
(Hansville/Kitsap Peninsula) & Double Bluff (Whidbey Island). There are 12+ orcas in the group, one of them breached while he was calling in his report. He had been watching since early afternoon - ~2 pm, a pod went by that looked like it included J1.
*
We received word that a pod of
orcas
were sighted near Partridge Bank (off
NW Whidbey
), so headed north & from Ft. Ebey State Park at
11:10 am we saw several orcas, including 1 adult male, heading E toward Partridge Pt, then turning W, then E again. We moved a bit north for a better view, and at
11:29 am saw 6 + orcas including 3 males heading south, just N. of Partridge Pt.
11:50 am - we saw 30+ orcas heading south at Partridge Bank. We then headed to Ft. Casey, where we watched whales parade by from

12:30 -
2:30 pm
(very close to the Port Townsend side!). MANY males were observed, and though we are still going through photos, we believe we were watching members of K & L pods (J's had likely been the group headed south about an hour earlier). We headed to
Bush Pt
. arriving at
3:35 pm, and sighted ~10 - 15 orcas off the south end of Ft. Flagler heading south, spread out in small groups. At 4 pm, more orcas came by, spread out in small groups, and at
4:02 pm the southern group turned and headed NW, while more orcas were still coming south from the Ft. Flagler area. at
4:09 pm, a group with 3 large males + 2 - 3 other whales came by heading south. For the next 30 - 40 minutes, whales were heading in every direction, with some foraging going on, but the main direction of travel remained southward. We watched as whales continued to stream by, mostly mid-channel, until

4:55 pm
we were surprised by a VERY CLOSE pass by - 40' offshore of Bush Pt, of a tight group traveling south fast - this group included L41. They went under after they passed, not surfacing again until they were quite a distance, then they surfaced in a resting line, still heading south. By
5:05 all the whales had passed Bush Pt.

John Fortin of
Skunk Bay
, called at

5:17 pm
to report a pod of
orcas
heading south between
Bush Pt. & Double Bluff
, Whidbey Island. Luann Fortin had called at

1:52 pm
to report orcas had just passed
Mutiny Bay
, heading toward Double Bluff. They were spread out, 2 large males were present, and a few boats were right on them. They then sent more details via email: A fabulous day for whale watching. We got to see not one but two large Orca pods. The first had two males and was more than 12-15 whales. The second pod was much larger with 3-4 males and at least one small fin. We were tipped off by a whale watch boat that a second pod was coming and we were able to watch them from Admiralty Bay past Mutiny Bay and Double Bluff then lost them as they headed towards Point-No-Point. They were spread out, in small groups. We saw many breaches and tail slaps.

They sure put on quite a show from

3:30 to almost 5 pm
in front of us at
Bush Point

Pat Scott of Bush Pt. called at

12:21 pm
to report 4-5
orcas
heading south past
Bush Pt
, including a calf and a large male. At

4:30 pm
, he called to report 2 orcas off Bush Pt, with an orange zodiac with them. At
4:50 pm he reported 10 - 12 more orcas passing by, doing tail lobs.
*
At

3:45 pm
Orca Network received a call from a woman reporting
orcas
off the south end of
Marrowstone Island
.
*
Just before
1pm
, at least 6
orcas
came by going south (south of Bush Pt, Whidbey Island) 1 large fin among them. The water was like glass so easy to see.

At

9:56 am
Orca Network received word from Erick Peirson that there were
orcas
at Partridge Bank heading east. At
10:28 am he called to say it was
L pod
, still heading east toward Whidbey Island. At
10:56 they turned south. Here are more details from Erick: We first encountered these orcas in HOT pursuit of that juvenile
minke
I mentioned a few days ago. This was not the friendly encounter we've seen over the summer; the minke was clearly panicked, traveling at high speed, and at one point even seemed to try to use the boat as a shield. Two females (L54?) and a male (L74?) were porpoising after it, and trying to flank and entrap it in much the same way they seem to herd salmon. We sat and watched this go on for 20 to 30 minutes before the minke escaped over Partridge Bank and headed toward Whidbey. So you can see why we thought they were transients! As we started looking further afield we began to see larger groups, and got good enough photographs to confirm that it was L pod. I'll be listening intently tonight (to Port Townsend hydrophone at OrcaSound.net).

Bob Whitney of
Port Townsend
called at

10:45 am
to report 12 - 15
orcas
, in 2 pods, heading SE off Pt. Wilson. At
2:10 pm, he called to say he had been watching from Pt. Wilson for the last 30 minutes as 30+ more orcas came by, heading into Admiralty Inlet.
*
Ann & Ron Olson called at

1:20 pm
to report they were on the PTMSC Protection Island Cruise, and it was turning into a whale watching trip as they were watching 2 groups of orcas, 9 in each group, between Protection Island and
Pt. Wilson
. She called again about a half hour later to report they were seeing more whales as they neared Port Townsend.
*
Alex DeSoto called at

12:35 pm
to report 8-10
orcas
heading south past
Bush Pt
, Whidbey Island, mid- channel. We got to meet him in person as we all watched the 2nd wave of whales pass Bush Pt. 4 hours later!

Chrissy McLean of the Port Townsend Marine Science Center called at

11:12 am
to report a pod of
orcas
were sighted between Marrowstone Island and N. of
Lagoon Pt, Whidbey Island
, heading south.
*
In addition to the
Minke
at Partridge Bank earlier in the day (reported above as being harassed by several L pod orcas!), I am fairly certain I saw a
Minke
off Port Townsend at about

12:50 pm
. I saw it surface twice - though I was watching from Ft. Casey State park so it was quite a distance, I saw a fin that was not quite orca-like, in a typical wandering Minke pattern.
