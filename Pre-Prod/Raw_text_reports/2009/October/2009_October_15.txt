Orca Sightings for October 15, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed out this afternoon and came across
3 Humpback Whales
between Race Rocks and Constance Bank. Two large female Humpback Whales were encountered 2 miles South East of Race Rocks and were being harassed by a Steller Sealion. One of the Humpback made a very dramatic Cartwheel as the Humpback tried to shake off the Sealion. We also saw a number of tail splashing and tail flicks as these large Baleen Whales tried to get rid of their pesky tormentor! We then moved on towards Constance bank where we encountered the 3 year old Humpback that has been given various nicknames, "Split Fin", "Bart", "Cleaver". One of the Humpback Whales we had encountered earlier is the Mother of "Split Fin" and it is so nice to see that these mothers are imprinting on their young that the Strait of Juan De Fuca is a great place to find food. "Split Fin" obviously knows this and has been hanging in the water off Victoria for almost two months now and has provided some very dramatic encounters!
