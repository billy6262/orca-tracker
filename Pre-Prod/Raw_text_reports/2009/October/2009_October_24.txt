============================================================

Entry 1:
After a long search, we finally caught up to a group of
Transient Orcas
that had been reported off
Nanaimo
at

9:30 AM
. They were eventually located on the west side of of Bowen Island at approximately

3:00 PM
. I have Id'ed 9 seperate individuals from photos, 3 of them calves. A photo, taken with a 300mm zoom lens, that shows 8 individuals is attached.
Whales IDed
are T36, T36B, a calf that surfaced consistently beside T36B, T46B plus a calf that surfaced with T46B, T46B1, T99, T99A and T99B. Photos of the calves will be sent to the Centre for Whale Research and to DFO. These T's were last seen heading east into Howe Sound along the northwest side of Bowen Island.

Humpback
Whale catalogue ID produced by Mark Malleson and the Center for Whales Research. It was fairly active and making some deep dives. We had finally found some animals including this Humpback almost at the end of our trip. Other animals included some Steller sea lions surfing in our wake and a few Dall's Porpoise.

It's been a while since I've seen some orca and finally today after a lot of searching we found a group of
transients
off of
Bowen Island, BC
. There were 9 or 10 whales but no adult males, a few females and 4 calves! I managed to ID two of them so far as T36 and T36B. They were mostly just traveling along Bowen island, with the calves trying to chase a seal every now and then. The first was one of the young whales trying to catch up to the rest after chasing a seal for a bit.
