Orca Sightings for October 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
From Mt Erie we could see the blows off
NAS Whidbey
of what could well be the two
grey whales
which have been lingering around Whidbey Island.

We went over west of
Victoria
to see a
Humpback
. She started to jump just before we started to leave, and what a spectacular sendoff. We have been seeing Humpback females and calves for the last several years on a regular basis to the south of Victoria.
