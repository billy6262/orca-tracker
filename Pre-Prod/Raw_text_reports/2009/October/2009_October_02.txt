Orca Sightings for October 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Viewed
~7-9 orcas
just south of
Kellett Bluff
traveling north at
1300
hours. They were well spread out and transiting at a moderate pace. We were able to identify L87 "Onyx" and possibly L77 "Matia". Maybe it was a date. We motored with them until they came even with Spieden Channel, about 1 hour.

Orca calls
off
Lime Kiln
(OrcaSound.net) this afternoon featuring some loud and lovely S-16 calls, buzzes, clicks, and many other great noises. They were also reported being heard on the Orca Sound hydrophone shortly afterwards (so they must be heading north).
