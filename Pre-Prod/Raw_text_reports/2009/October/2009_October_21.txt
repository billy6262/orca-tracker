Orca Sightings for October 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Jefferson County Extension WSU Beach Watchers saw a pod of
orcas
off
Ft. Flagler
on Weds. around
2pm
while we were doing our micro plastic monitoring for the Port Townsend Marine Science Center. Too far away to get good pictures. We were on the beach that faces west and the orcas were straight out from the parking lot.

Donna Sandstrom called to say she and others on the beach at
Bush Pt, Whidbey Island
, watched the
orcas
approach Bush Pt. and then listened to the orcas as they passed by in the dark at around

7:30 pm
- saying it was "completely magical"!
*
After hearing the orcas were heading back north from Edmonds this morning, I headed out to try to find them, and at

12:15 pm
found them from
Bush Pt
, as they were crossing the entrance to Hood Canal. They were on the far side, doing some foraging, lunging, and tail lobbing, with a young one breaching a few times as they continued up
Marrowstone Island
. I watched until about

1:30 pm
, then headed up to Ft. Casey State Park, where at
1:45 pm I watched as they approached Ft. Flagler/Marrowstone Pt, continuing north spread out across Admiralty Inlet. They continued
north
past Pt. Townsend, staying nearer the PT side of the Inlet, then after passing Pt. Wilson, headed over toward Partridge Pt, Whidbey Island, at about 4 pm. Just as the rain started falling and it looked like the whales were going to head up to San Juan Island or back out to sea, a male turned back, then another, then another, and soon all the whales were heading south toward Protection Island, then SE back into Admiralty Inlet! By 5 pm it was evident they were on a definite course back down the sound, passing Port Townsend heading south. I had to run an errand, then headed south and got to Lagoon Pt. at 6 pm, and the orcas were just arriving, still southbound, mid-channel. There was still enough light to see them, and it was quiet enough to hear their blows as they passed by. I saw at least 4 adult males during the day, but the whales were too distant and spread out for good photos or IDs, but preliminary word is that some members of all three pods were present, however it doesn't appear all members of all pods were there. The day included the brightest double rainbow I have ever seen, sun, rain, and meeting a lot of great folks along west Whidbey, all of us lucky and happy to get a glimpse of the whales today!

2:20 pm
: We counted 10 [
orcas
] in what appears to be two groups moving due North in the Inlet midway
between Whidbey and Port Townsend
. If you draw a line from Seacrest Lane over to the Port Townsend ferry landing they are 2/3 of the way over in the inlet. There are a couple of big fins in the pods and now two of the whales are breaching. They are not moving as fast as when we first saw them at the tip of Marrowstone Island - and they are working the tidal rip. Update at
3:30pm: We are watching as the lead pod has cleared the inlet and looks as tho they are going straight ahead or turning left - hard to tell.The second pod is on their heels and a third smaller group is half a mile behind. A whale watcher in about a 30 foot, black bow and white stern area with twin black outboards and maybe 20 people is to be commended. He sat and drifted well to the West of the moving pods and when he moved North to catch up he headed due West to clear the area and then came up well clear to drift again. Lots of breaching in the second pod - couple of stragglers in the last pod.

I spent an amazing day out on the water off of
San Diego
today. I planned to run down south to explore the Coronado Islands today but never quite made it. About 6 miles out of Mission Bay, in 900 ft of water, I saw two enormous blows! The animals attached to them were definitely larger than anything I have seen before.
Blue Whales
for sure! I was fortune enough to see 5 surface periods total, each lasting about 2-5 minutes with anywhere from 6 to 15 surfacings at a time. I then tried to head towards the Coronado Islands again. On the way I spotted another Blue Whale about 3 miles south of the first two! Then about 5 miles north of the islands I found over 100
Common Dolphins
. Lots of acrobatics and surfing in the swells! Beautiful animals! By the time the dolphins decided to head on their way I had to turn around and head back.
