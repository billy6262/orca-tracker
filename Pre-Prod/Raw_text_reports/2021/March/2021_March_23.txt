Entry 2:
Possession Sound
- The two close to mainland were
CRC 531 and 2249
.
----We scoured the southern end of Hat island as well as the Snohomish river delta, but it was the
north end of Hat Island where we found our first whales
of the day. They turned out to be
CRC53 and 21
, and they were traveling closely together, socializing with each other as they relaxed above a shallow sand bar. After some great views we decided to branch and check out some blows we saw in the distance near the Tulalip waterfront. Soon we were on scene with two new gray whales that gave us some great looks at their tail flukes. These two whales ended up being CRC 2249 and 531 and they were headed for the Snohomish river delta. After 531 gave us a few more tail flukes and she began to move into the shallows of the delta with 2249 we decided to go expand on our wildlife check list. Moving up to Camano Island, we found two adult bald eagles that were in great lighting for some wonderful photos. By now the sun was out, the clouds were disappearing, and so we decided to once again join up with Little Patch and Shackleton. They had made their way to the south end of Hat Island and after settling in on scene we got a nice big spy hop from Little Patch. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)

. Appear to be heading south. -Ted Wiederhold
*

11:50 - Gray
is feeding
between Mariners Cove and Polnell Pt
. -Terra Parham
*

15:30 -
Update-I guessing wrong on the direction-the gray is heading south and staying more toward Camano. I just happened to see a puff just in my line of sight
between Mariners Cove and the point just south of Maple Grove Beach
, not terribly far out from Camano.
3:30pm

15:17 -
I just spotted a spout out in the channel
between Mariners Cove and Maple Grove Beach
, and it appears to be heading southwest, heading possible in the direction of Polnell-ish. Way too far away to get photos unfortunately!

11:48 update -
I ran out to see where it was going and its way down/southwest of me now, but I think it might be Patch - appears to be a huge white spot on back half. Maybe Polnell folks will get a better look.

11:38 -
I'm watching a gray now (
11:38) that just came south from Utsalady mid channel and then headed toward Whidbey and is now grabbing a bite at the south end of the Happy Meal mudflats on the way
toward Polnell
. -Marianne Parry
*

09:45 -
We started seeing probably the same gray from our deck, we're up on the hill right next to
Greenbank
Farm. We hurried down to our community beach and only saw one more spout, very close to shore and deep in the little cove that's formed by our beach on North Bluff Rd. and Dines Point. Lost sight after that. What a treat! -Deja Brandeis
*

09:45 -
Spotted a
gray whale a few hundred feet from our shoreline (in Greenbank
, due west of Baby Island), heading north towards the Greenbank Farm area. I rarely spot them so close to this side of the island, very exciting! -Martha Sinclair
*

17:31 - Gray
spotted 50 meters off
Enetai Beach in Bremerton
, heading south towards ferry terminal. -Brian Fiesta
*

17:31 -
Kitsap Orca Watch received a report of
a Gray off Bremerton:

5:31pm, Gray Whale spotted 50 meters (close!) off Enetai Beach (Bremerton) heading south. -Susan Marie Andersson
*
I live on
Bainbridge Island on Rich Passage
now. I moved here in January. We had our first whale siting today:
a gray whale
. Additional info: So this gray passed by at least 3 times today: first headed deeper into the passage toward Bremerton, then back out toward the entrance, then back in
toward Bremerton
again. Then I had to go to town to run errands... so I don't know if it headed back out again. It was not surfacing in a manner where I could get a good look at the dorsal fin or back, but having seen so many grays over the years in Langley, I was pretty certain that's what it was. The last time I saw it pass by, the ferry came very close to it. The passage really narrows there and I don't think the captain would have seen it since it was barely surfacing.... with what you shared, this makes me concerned about its energy level and whether it is managing to find any food. It is very rocky here!! Ghost shrimp need a sandy bottom, right?? -Anon.

Sighting 3/23 9AM in
Port Washington Narrows

At

07:10

reported in the area before and after this. -gs
