Seeing blows among the whitecaps

---- Blink and you might miss them... With a strong wind whipping up the waves in
Saratoga Passage
, we were fortunate to spot
T87 and the T124A2s
from Hidden Beach as they bucked the whitecaps on their southbound travels. Although the whales were closer to the Whidbey side the encounter was brief as they disappeared quickly in confused seas. T87 certainly gets around, and keeps us wondering who he'll show up with next (photos Richard Snowberger taken from shore, zoomed and cropped). photo - "The magnificent T87 bucking the wind and waves near Hidden Beach, Whidbey Island." -Sandra Pollard
