Hey, staying at an airbnb a quarter of a mile south of the

Entry 3:
11:23 - Gray whales CRC185 and CRC723
are here. 185 is southbound and 723 is aiming west. [
map indicates location near
Mabana
, right off of Camano Island. -gs
]----We had a fun day yesterday [3/19/21] in Saratoga Passage watching a total of 4 whales in the same vicinity as they crossed paths with each other. At the end of our visit, two of the whales,
CRC383, and CRC723, (Lucyfer)
, paired up in the deep water and were rolling around with each other. 383, and 723 were first documented in our area in 1999, and 2000 respectively. Those arrivals coincided with an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) that happened during those two years in which there were unusually high numbers of gray whales that died along the west coast looking for food. During these events in the past we have often added more gray whales to our group of regular visitors called the "Sounders" as a result. Researchers aren't exactly sure what causes these UMEs but it might be linked to a lack of food in some of the gray whale's typically feeding areas. Luckily some of these whales find that our area has food and then they come back for more in later years, adding to the numbers we can see here and helping the population as a whole. 383 and 723 are shown in the close-up tail fluke photos, and CRC53 Little Patch has the water spray around his flukes. -Bart Rulon, Photographer/Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

11:00 -
We left
a gray whale
heading northwest from
Eagle Crest in Saratoga Passage
. It had been feeding very close to shore for at least 3 hours during high tide between the Eagle Crest tram, the 2 buoys and a little bit north, swimming back and forth many times. Hopefully, I got a few good photos for ID. He was feeding so close to shore on our rocky beach, it was amazing. -Kristina Trowbridge
*
Gray whale #531
was feeding just off
Mabana Beach
and was giving us some great looks and even showed us his tail flukes. Continuing north from there about a half mile we joined
CRC #53 "Little Patch"
as he was traveling around in the deeper waters of Saratoga. We headed back south after that with blows in the distance from
CRC#185 and 723
! -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
