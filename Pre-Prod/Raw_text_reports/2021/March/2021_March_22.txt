heading North toward Kellett

15:33 - Center for Whale Research Encounter #14: "… Through binocs, and Katie taking dot shots with her longer lense, we could see that it was the
J16s (minus J26) and the J19s
together on the shoreline-despite a rising wind and a swell rolling out of the southwest. At about 1240,
J16 and J42 split
from the group and headed west. The others also eventually came offshore and milled a bit before heading back down island. We decided to go around these whales and head down island to try and find some other whales. The water got sloppier the further down island we went but we found J26 by himself heading slowly up island off Edwards Point maybe a few hundred yards off the shoreline. …" [See CWR Encounter #14 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-14 for full summary and photos.]

J-Pod came back in to Haro Strait from out west this morning
and spent most of this afternoon foraging and resting on the west side of San Juan Island. Six-month-old
J58 Crescent
was a little ball of energy, seen here on one of her only "normal" surfacings off Lime Kiln (as opposed to upside down or sideways, which she did plenty of while she played around at the surface as mom foraged). -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 2:
15:42 -
Maija Holston, WSF Marine Ops, emailed to report: Master off TOKITAE reports
3 orca whales headed south in Possession Sound
close to the Mukilteo dock.
*

15:40 -
My sons and I saw
at least 4 orcas from the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry
at
3:40 this afternoon! Fins and blowholes. Sorry we weren't close enough for photos, but it's the first time in 21 year as a Washington State resident I've seen orcas so I wouldn't have been much help identifying them! We were toward the end of the ferry's westbound transit, so it appeared to me they were in the middle of the channel there. -Collett Janning
*

Entry 3:
Hood Canal to Admiralty (T65As, T77, T77B, T77E)
-

19:30 -
Caught one more glimpse of the male fin; he was a little bit further NW of first sighting, I think likely milling/hunting in the area that is just across from the entrance to Hood Canal, fairly close to the Whidbey side. Getting too dark to see much now.

19:10 -
Just returned home and saw one male orca fin
~1 mile south of Bush Pt.
at
7:10 pm - looked like it may have been chasing something/moving closer to shore, and unfortunately out of my vision for now; but neighbors saw at least two, so will continue watching! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Anna SinghDa and Pip Gordon called to report
at least 5 orcas, including a bull, south of Bush point

These were the
orcas at Hood Canal
and came by our house today. They were close to Jefferson County side, finally, for once, but quickly traveled to Kitsap side after passing the bridge, and we followed them down to our boat launch (we live on paradise Bay) and they seemed to stall for a while (must have found some orca sausages for lunch) as they hugged the shoreline for about 1/2 hour before traveling on. -Tammy Shelton
*

12:29 -
They just passed me off Talah Shores fr. mid canal.

11:39 -
They passed north side of bridge ...mid to east canal a few minutes ago. Still heading north. They are grouped closer together now. They were taking longer dives around and north of the bridge.

11:08 -
They are just
south of bridge
now. East side. Still slow travel.

10:10 - [orcas]
Spotted 4 just south of Bridgehaven, 1010am, far east side of canal, still heading north. Coming up frequently far above water. Slow pace as they are just riding the tide. -Tisa Annette
*

10:07 - [orcas]
I think that I just spotted two just north of Lofall. (If what I saw were orcas, it was a good size pod not too far off the east side of the canal heading towards the bridge.) -Alan Robertson

Email received at
09:56 from Randy Kimball who's just
south of King Spit
: "Hello, I saw
a pod of Orcas heading north in Hood Canal
about 30 minutes ago [~

09:30 -alb]. They were on front of Bangor Base heading north towards Hood Canal Bridge. I saw two large orcas but there could have been more. I will watch to see if they turn around..."

08:05 -
