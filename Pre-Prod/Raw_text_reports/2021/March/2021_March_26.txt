Orca Sightings for March 26, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
20:00 - As of 8 PM tonight at least some members of
J-Pod were southbound in Boundary Pass
- could be a good night to keep those hydrophones on! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*
Seen from the shore of
Galiano Island
, a distant sighting of
J pod as they swam south in Georgia Strait
in the late afternoon. Very spread out, a few tail slaps and breaches. A distant sighting is better than none! -Karoline Cullen
*

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T46Bs) -

11:15-

12:00 -
I wanted to report a sighting of Bigg's-type killer whales. 3/26 between
11:15 and
12:00,
5 miles ENE of Port Angeles
. I saw
5-6 whales predating a sea lion
. The pod looked to have incapacitated the prey, which was alive but barely, while a juvenile attacked it and played with it. It was presumably members of
T046[B] pod because one of the individuals was a leucistic sub-adult
. I didn't have a camera with me for any photo-ID, but I am 100% confident in my report (I have experience in whale fieldwork and as captain of a whale-watching boat). -Andrew Micks

Entry 3:
~

12:00 -
These whales were last seen pushing east towards Whidbey around noon.

10:25 - At least 4 orcas in Rosario Strait south of the ferry lanes
, first northbound then southbound as of
10:25. Thought to be Ts but after yesterday's report you never know! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*
Fri, Mar 26 - Admiralty Inlet - Dave Anderson just called, and said his neighbor told him this morning he had seen
orcas headed north off Bush Pt.
He told Dave about it at 10 am but didn't say what time he had seen them.

GRAY WHALES - Fri, Mar 26 - Rosario Strait - We decided to take a turn to the south in Rosario Strait and were rewarded almost immediately with the tall spout of
GRAY WHALE
! WHAT?! This was an unusual location for a gray but certainly a pleasant surprise! It became apparent early on in the encounter that this whale was not one of the typical "Sounders" that visits Washington each spring. The markings on his or her tail striking - what a beautiful fluke! At one point the light hit this whale just right creating a beautiful "rainblow". We submitted the photos to Cascadia and they were able to identify the whale as
CRC-1364
, a whale seen only once before on
April 9, 2011 off La Push, WA. -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
[
"...matched to
CRC1364
previously only seen on 4/9/2011 in NW WA outer coast, close to La Push." -Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective
]

Entry 4:
08:15 - Gray
was feeding a little (i.e., waving) but moving quickly south. It went through the mudflats but didn't appear to feed and kept right on going down toward
Polnell
. This was very close to the beach this time and I wish I had had time to grab my camera sooner! In the seconds it took to get outside, I missed my chance at pecs/flukes shots.
*

Entry 5:
Gray whale
season - we have
at least 10 gray whales in Island County
, sometimes hard to find with our gray skies and gray water, but they're here. Here are a few photos taken Friday,
March 26th. All pics zoomed and cropped. -Jill Hein

18:39 -
More easterly towards and nearing north side of
Elger Bay
.

17:50 -
Current watching
a lone gray 1/4 mid channel from high bank mid Baby Island Heights
very slowly SE bound. Amongst a bunch of barking rafting sea doggies(lions) -Marilyn Armbruster
*

14:40 -
Allyson Koontz,
Elger Bay
, Camano Island, called to report
a gray whale hanging out in the bay
. Today the whale has been circling all the way out in the channel then returns, then circles the bay again. They've been seeing grays come and go since Sunday, usually a lone whale most of the times, other days have been up to 3-4.
