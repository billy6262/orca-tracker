Arrived at Land Bank, SJI at 1500. Saw one female and a couple flashes of dorsals that were gone as soon as they appeared between 1500-1505, offshore, slightly
south of Land Bank, heading south
. Very tough viewing with the weather. -Cassie Barclay

14:55 - 6+ members of J-pod southbound
, a mile or more out across from
Landbank/Edwards Point
. Hard to see in choppy seas, at first 2 males were separate but then joined the group. Diving for long periods, they traveled S/SW away from shore. I saw
J27 Blackberry
for sure and I'm almost positive J47 Notch was there. Photos heavily cropped and enlarged. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Js made an unexpected appearance in Haro Strait
this afternoon, heading south! Even though all the whales present were in one group, they were tough to spot in the big seas while doing long dives. Thankfully J27 Blackberry, pictured here, surfaced high enough to show his distinct saddle patch to confirm the ID in the field. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
