Orca Sightings for March 10, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (J17s and ?) -

12:50 -
It sounds like the J17s have been spotted
near Victoria
, which creates more questions than it answers! Were they the whales on the LK hydrophone? Were they also the group reported as Ts? Where is the rest of J-Pod? -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

12:55 - [orcas]
It looked like whichever they were, they started heading offshore
past Clover Point in Victoria
. -Jackie Cowan
*

12:15 -
Can't say for sure that these were transients, but I did manage to film a couple of orcas off of Trial Island at
12:15 PM today. [per Monika Wieland Shields, OBI: "I can't say 100% either but the group composition is right for the J17s."]

11:19 - [orcas]
Got them off
Ten Mile Point
. Heading for Baynes Channel. -Gerald Graham
*

09:57 - [J pod] Calls on LK hydrophones.
-Tami McEathron

Entry 2:
16:10 - [gray] Something spouting in the Snohomish delta
right now. -Jaime McBroom
*

Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

13:55 -
There is something spouting around
Utsalady Bay
right now. I can't find my binoculars though to get a closer look!! Been watching it for about 30 minutes. -Whitney Sparling
*

08:30 -
More grays frolicking in
upper Saratoga
! I'm watching spouts way across the channel just
south of Utsalady
, heading south. I'm guessing there are
two
based in the frequency. It's dead calm so the sound is traveling and the puffs are spectacular! (update: There are definitely two grays, putting on quite a show for the folks at Maple Grove Beach(?). I saw a couple of spouts simultaneously right next to each other - pretty awesome!!)

07:30 -
What an exciting morning! While the coffee was brewing on this gorgeous, calm, sunny morning, I heard a faint puff through closed windows(!) and bolted out just in time to spot a big happy Gray, having a leisurely stroll past Mariners Cove en route to a yummy breakfast at the happy meal mudflats! As I was attempting to get some video, I heard a puff further out and saw a big dark back-arch out in the channel to the south, probably
out from Polnell
or maybe a little further south. I didn't see that one again though. The first lovely gray is the one that is mostly dark gray but looks like it has a bunch of white mini-marshmallows randomly stuck on its back. I know I've seen it before, and I'm sure you'll know who I'm talking about. -Marianne Parry
