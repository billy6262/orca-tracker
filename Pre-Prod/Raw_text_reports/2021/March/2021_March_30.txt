Orca Sightings for March 30, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
(T18s) -

12:20-

19:21 - 2 orcas approaching Harwood Island
. Will try to confirm number. It wasn't until quite a while later that I saw another two. There was definitely a considerable distance between the first two orca and the second two that followed behind. I watched them until
3:20. At that point Mark and I decided to go to another vantage point to continue watching.
At
4:30 we saw two orca approaching Quadra Island
. At that time, it was difficult to determine whether they would travel on the east or west side of Quadra. At
5:25 the four orca were together on the southwest tip of Quadra.
At
7:21 we left all four of them going north through the Discovery Passage

Entry 5:
13:11 - [grays]
Just giving a heads up that in the center of
Saratoga Passage heading toward Fox Spit
I am seeing two whales and it looks like a skiff from NOAA is following them. I thought they were grays but when I watched both of them breach, they looked more like the undersides of humpbacks. I am too far away to know for sure even with binoculars but, I'm sure NOAA will be able to report them more accurately. Also, there is a group of Steller sea lions closer to the shore. I'm at Bells Beach, Langley, WA. Wow what an incredible gift to see on such a beautiful calm day...Update: too far away to get pictures and yes, they came almost fully out of the water and it was amazing to see. Glad others are closer and able to confirm they are gray whales. -Kristin Carlson
