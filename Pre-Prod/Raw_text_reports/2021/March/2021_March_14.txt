Sun, Mar 14 - Northern Saratoga Passage/Skagit Bay - On our way south along Whidbey island Captain Shane found
gray whale #44 Dubknuck traveling near Strawberry Point
. Dubknuck was very cooperative and gave us some great looks with some close surface action and even showing his flukes a few times. As Dubknuck continued south we decided to wave goodbye and continue our search for more. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

Little Patch [53]
, and then
2259 and 383
together looking very chummy!----We had received reports of a gray whale to the north in Saratoga Passage, but lucky for us, as we headed in that direction, Captain Carl spotted not one, not two, but
three gray whale spouts
even closer to home! We investigated the first spout and found it to be an old friend, #53 Little Patch, near Camano Head. He seemed to recognize us, logging at the surface and then turning our direction for a nice close pass along our starboard side as if to say "hello!". We bid farewell and then headed off toward the other two spouts which were quite intriguing. These two whales were swimming so closely to each other that you could hardly tell where one whale ended and the other began! Some wind and chop made it difficult to identify these whales at first, but thanks to some persistence, we were able to capture some ID shots of veteran Sounder #383 along with a relative newcomer, gray whale #2259 who first appeared last year and lingered in
Possession Sound
long into the fall. One wonders if #2259 ever left? Hard to say! -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
