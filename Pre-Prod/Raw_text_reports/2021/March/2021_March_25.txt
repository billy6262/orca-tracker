10:30 -
I saw a beautiful California
Gray Whale
slowly cruising north off of Whidbey Island and between Goat Island. He lingered for a while and swam north toward the buoy, then turned around and swam back south. He did a beautiful dive and I could see his tail completely. He was in my view here in
Oak Harbor off of Whidbey Island
from around
9:30 till
10:30. I believe this same whale was here around
8:30 am yesterday, 3-24-21 but I forgot to report it as I was very busy during the day. The whale appears to be alone. -Trisha Ferreira/Oak Harbor WA

Was able to
ID 723
and thinkin 383 as two gray whales traveling south by the Clinton ferry landing, will try to confirm tonight with bigger screen. ----… We cruised back into Port Gardner and as we passed the Clinton ferry landing joined up with two gray whales! They were CRC 723 and 383 and they were both hanging out cruising south together. We got some close looks and even a couple of great flukes before these two giants of the deep waved goodbye and continued south along Whidbey Island. …Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
