Not sure of species, I am sitting on my stairs to the beach at xxxx SW Camano Drive "Saratoga Pass " looking west at Whidbey Island and can hear them breaching at
10:01 exactly. I heard breathing, it's very calm, quiet, and flat tonight; you could hear a needle drop on Whidbey. I heard a total of two breaths, not sure on amount of whales, and headed south for sure. Hard to believe I haven't ever heard that in 48 years, it did however excite me like a kid at Christmas. I'll be sure and pay more attention and give more time, and also wanted to thank you for your efforts and all that you do. [Thanks, that's very helpful. It sounds like
a gray whale
on the move. -hg] -Andrew Smith
