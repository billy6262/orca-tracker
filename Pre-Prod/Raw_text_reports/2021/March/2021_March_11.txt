18:10 -
A gray is spouting waaay across the channel near the buoy at
Utsalady
-
6:10pm. It's apparently late for happy hour somewhere because it's in a big hurry.

11:25 -
There is at least one gray still at the
north end of Camano
, but now I'm seeing a huuuge gray southbound in Saratoga much closer to Whidbey and hustling down the channel (
11:25am). I got a pretty good look in binocs as it did a deep dive - lots of prominent bumps on the knuckles - prob not unusual though. It is already past Utsalady and def on the move.

10:20 -
Quick update on the grays I'm still watching. There are
definitely two, maaaayyybe three
...naaah, partying over north of Utsalady. One of them has an enormous spout - I'm a couple of miles away and it's a little bit breezy, but with binocs, I can clearly see two massive streams coming out of the one whale. It's like twin volcanos - lol! The other gray spouts the way I normally see - impressive and lovely but not the twin turbos that first has.

09:45 -
I'm seeing spouts way out in the channel between Mariners Cove and the northern tip of Camano (

9:40-
9:55am). I'm pretty sure there are two of them based on binoc viewing. They appear to be heading north, but are in no hurry at the moment. -Marianne Parry

08:30-

09:15 - Gray whale
seen at 8:3 am off of Whidbey Island in
Oak Harbor, close to Goat Island
. He was leisurely swimming north towards Deception Pass Bridge direction. He was diving and surveying Skagit Bay. It is
9:15 and I can still see him lingering by one of the buoys! -Trisha Ferreira, Oak Harbor WA
*

Entry 4:
Holmes Harbor -

17:30 -
As I was heading home, I stopped north of
Bells Beach
, and pretty sure it's Little Patch but will let Orca Network do the id'ing. My photo was taken at
6:30 pm, so not real clear. once he passed Fox Spit, he milled back and forth south of Fox like he was just going to hang out for a bit. -Marilyn Armbruster

Blow right in front of
Fox Spit
, still southbound.

17:25 -
Observing blows from 1 gray currently southbound just north of
Fox Spit
. I'm at Camano State Park, so too far for me. -Krista Paulino
