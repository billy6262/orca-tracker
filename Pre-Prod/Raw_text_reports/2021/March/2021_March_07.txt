============================================================

Entry 1:
Baynes Channel/Haro Strait (T124As) -

11:16-

12:22
- Center for Whale Research Encounter #11: "… The whales were mid-channel and being pushed north while facing east with the strong current. The crew on Mike 1 counted five animals, but George called again to say there was a straggler around 300 meters from the group. The main group was quickly identified as members of the 124A matriline, including a new calf! The little one was travelling alongside the 11-year-old
T124A4
, and would be her first offspring! The
T124A group
is quite prolific, the matriarch having given birth to six of her own offspring, three of them now with calves of their own. The whales were somewhat hard to follow, as they zigged and zagged their way slowly east upon entering Haro Strait, presumably well-fed with long dives. Mark and Joe were able to confirm
the entirety of the T124A matriline
(less the dispersed T124A2s)
including T124A1
, who is not always with the group. …" [See CWR Encounter #11 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-11 for full summary and photos]

Continuing north along the Camano Island shoreline we found a feeding gray whale at Mabana Beach. After some great feeding action, we moved a little further north and found
#723 Lucy who was also feeding like crazy along Camano Island
. The whales were definitely getting their fill as they made multiple passes in the shallow waters. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
