Center for Whale Research Encounter #13: "… As Mike 1 got abeam of them, Mark confirmed that they were the
J17's
. Fish eaters, as Brian had suspected! The J17's were last seen two days prior westbound in Race Passage but must have decided to turn back rather than connect with the rest of J pod, which had headed west out the Juan de Fuca 24 hours ahead of them. …" [See CWR Encounter #13 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-13 for full summary and photos]

Entry 6:
16:45 -
Our sighting at
Golden Gardens
was on
March 12,
4:45pm.
Not sure if it was a Gray or a Minke
. We first saw it in the middle of the bay and it was hanging around a buoy, above the surface, then a dive or two. It then moved a few thousand feet to another buoy and did the same thing for a minute or so. It then continued to swim, breached, and disappeared. Not sure about which direction it traveled, but it kept on a straight path, starting at the water opposite the farthest out end of the beach and moving toward and past the Shilshole Marina. -Linda Barckert
