Center for Whale Research Encounter #87: "We saw our first whales around 1150 halfway
between Gooch Island and Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island
. The encounter began at 1155 with
J27
traveling down mid-Haro Strait by himself. The whales were very spread out. About a quarter mile to the northwest of
J27
we saw
J26
also traveling down Haro.
J16
was about 100 yards to his east. J26 briefly turned east before continuing south again. J27 was then seen chasing a fish to the east of us." [See CWR Encounter #87 for full summary and more photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-87 -photo - J31 and J56 by Dave Ellifrit

Entry 6:
South Puget Sound
- Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021. We keep our sailboat on our private buoy at: LAT. N 47 07.481 LONG. W 122 46.401. I
heard a blow
and caught a brief glimpse, observing the whale from shore as it passed northbound, following the contour of the beach between our boat and shore. I went down to the beach and heard another blow from the area of
Dogfish Bight
. I was on our beach north of Big Slough (Tolmie State Park). Judging by the tide and location, I would guess it was in 10 to 15 feet of water. -Barry James
