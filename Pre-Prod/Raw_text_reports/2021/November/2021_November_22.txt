Orca Sightings for November 22, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Central Puget Sound (Js and Ks) -

17:09 - They passed Point Robinson still heading south.
----After almost a full year absence, we finally got a visit from the
Southern Resident Orca J-pod and K-pods
. It was blistering cold, wet and windy, but it is all worth it when you see those beautiful black fins coasting through the water towards you. We got the most unexpected, close pass, from
J35-Tahlequah, J57-Phoenix, and K35-Sonata
as they were chasing fish close to shore. I threw one in of my favorite boy,
J27-Blackberry
, at the end. -Kelly Burns Keenan

16:25 -
Many whales, at least 5 southbound
between KVI and Point Robinson
right now, viewed from Three Tree Point (with scope). Whales are approximately here: 47.4169710, -122.4162139. -Raphael Fennimore

at least 3 moving eastward

15:55 -
Trailers have now passed Dilworth, big spread, lots of foraging, and a whole bunch of whales! Some closer to shore but mostly mid channel,
southbound
in lots of loose small groups.
----So lovely to see the
SRKW's
again, their long absence was most certainly felt. We waited for them as the gathering dusk brought in foggy rain and glistening dorsals late Monday with just enough daylight left to snap a couple pictures. The spread was so wide as they poured down the channel, we thought most were too far from shore for pics until Sonata (I think, couldn't get a good saddle) appeared out of seemingly nowhere, making us scream out of surprise and delight followed by
Tahlequah
and others. The chop was so high, the only saddles I saw was
J38 and J27
as the darkening skies swallowed them up as they powered south. -Marla Smith

15:27 -

Seahurst

3 orcas pass in front of the

11:20 -
They are traveling fast!! They just passed
Fay Bainbridge
. Kitsap to mid channel. Continuing south at a good pace. Saw several breaches. They are really spread out too. I think 4 maybe 5. It was so hard to keep track with the waves. One large male for sure.

At

09:51
Marie Waterman, WSF Marine Ops, emailed: Master reports, via 800MHz, they have slowed due to
two (2) orca SB [southbound] just off Apple Tree Cove.
*

08:55 -
Sara Frey called to report seeing
orcas off Apple Tree Point
, Kingston, heading
southbound
, west of the southbound shipping lanes. She is seeing at least 5 orcas including a male, female, and a little one. They are still north of the ferry. Seas are choppy, fierce south wind. Sometimes down for long periods. Little one definitely hard to see in the chop without binoculars.
*

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound -

16:50 - [orcas]
They passed underneath the
Harstine Bridge
. -Erin Pedersen
*

15:23 -
They are still traveling in slow motion, with deep dives. Heading northwest across from the far shore of
Budd Inlet
, angling toward Hunter Point, Squaxin/Harstine/Hope and Steamboat islands. I totally missed where they came from - before an alert from someone on Cooper Point.

15:10 - At least five orca (one large bull) heading north out of Budd Inlet
, passing in front of Boston Harbor Marina. Slow, leisurely surfacing series. Close to shore. Sea lions have dispersed from the tip of Cooper Point, except for one silly and tough one in front of my bank with a giant fish! -Kim Merriman
*
~

14:15 -
Approximately at
2:15 pm, spotted
three to four orcas swimming Dana Passage
between Harstine Island and Henderson Inlet/Fishtrap Loop. One of the orcas was much larger than the other orcas - extremely large fin. They were headed south towards Boston Harbor/Olympia waters. Currently, we also have a group of sea lions taking up residence at the head of Henderson Inlet. The group of 12 to 15 (?) sea lions were not disturbed by the orcas passing, as the orcas were closer to the
Harstine Island
side of the passage rather than to Henderson Inlet. The sea lions took up residence about three weeks ago right near our house. Nobody in the neighborhood can remember sea lions doing this before. We have seen them swim by before in the winter but never take up residence in Henderson Inlet for presumably the winter. We are always so excited to see the orcas as they don't make it to the South Sound very often. -Jacquelyn L. Jacobs
*

10:58 - [orcas]
We just saw them, just south of
Vaughn Bay
heading north in Case Inlet. There were at least 5, including the small one! -Leslie Hanks
*

10:08 -
Cammy Malm LaRiviere reports seeing
6-8 orcas
, including at least one very small one in upper
Case Inlet heading into Allyn
. She is viewing from Grapeview, directly across from north end Harstine Island. [Photos are at least good enough to confirm T68 and her son T68A (large male). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network]

12:15 -
At
12:30 Griffin Hoins called again to report seeing the pod of
7 orcas
again at around
12:15 in
Case Inlet
. Orcas were heading southbound, still north of Herron Island grouped up. They were a little surface active; he reports seeing little tail lob and a spyhop while group traveled in general south, much closer to the Key Peninsula side. He's viewing from north end Harstine Island.

10:07 -
Griffin Hoins called to report
orcas at the northern end of Pickering Passage
, north end Harstine Island, heading northbound. He reports 7 orcas, including male and little one. He is part of a crew working on the marina at Harstine Point which includes pile driving. Marine mammal observers are on sight, and they do suspend work when whales are in the zone.

10:06 -
My neighbor just texted me at work that they are by
Harstine Point
right now. -Leslie Blaisdell
