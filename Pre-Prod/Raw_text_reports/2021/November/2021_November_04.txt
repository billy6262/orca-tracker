Entry 2:
05:00 -
This morning while out Aurora chasing, I heard a whale @ 20 ft. offshore on
Alki
. It was surfacing with blows frequently and sounded
like Orca blows
. Only one. I looked for the dorsal in the dim light pollution but didn't see one so had to be a small dorsal. Water was super calm. It was hugging shore toward lighthouse from Alki Beach (westbound). Heard about 30 blows on the quiet water. At first thought it was just a seal or sea lion, but it was methodical loud blows. Only about 15 seconds apart. -Kristen Alvarez
