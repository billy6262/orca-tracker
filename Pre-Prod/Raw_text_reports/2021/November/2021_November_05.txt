Orca Sightings for November 5, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (J pod, L pod, K12s) - We were lucky enough to see a superpod of Orcas head
through Cattle Pass late Friday afternoon
. We were told that there were
around 60, traveling south together
. We understand that these were likely resident pods. [not a true superpod, as all SRKWs were not present -gs] -Peg Bill

Center for Whale Research Encounter #86: A little to the north of
L85, L105
milled with
J49
and another juvenile.
J37
crossed the stern of the boat on her way to somewhere.
L86 and L125
were also seen traveling quietly down the channel by themselves. Dave then saw a small group to the north near the Shaw Island shoreline and headed over there. This was the
L22s, L91s, and J47
traveling together. J35 and J57 passed by on the other side of the boat not too far from another pair that turned out to be
J46 and J53
. The SR3 team had reported seeing the K12s at the beginning of their encounter with the lead whales. Dave never thought he made it to the leaders and did not encounter any K pod whales." [See CWR Encounter #86 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-86 for photos and full summary]
