Hearing really faint
echolocation on the Sunset Bay hydro
. -Ariel Yseth

I think I've heard a few faint
calls on the Sunset Bay hydrophone
the past few minutes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Can definitely hear them on the
Bush Point Hydrophone
. -Cherie StOurs

Viewing from Shore Meadows. Orcas surfing inbound Matson container ship on
Hansville
side. Good visibility but a bit wet for cameras and binoculars. Trending south.

08:25 -
Seeing adult male plus a couple of others milling south of
Bush Point
, looking toward Foulweather Bluff. Big splashes. -Sandra Pollard

08:00 -
Karen Scott called to report seeing at least two orcas, male and smaller one,
south of Bush Pt
., Whidbey side of mid channel, heading southbound.
*

07:55 -
Saw at least
three orcas, mid channel, south of Bush Point, traveling south
. Saw one breach. -Bill Pippine
*

07:15 - [SRKW] Loud calls, Bush Point hydrophone.
-Rachel Haight
*

Entry 2:
NW Strait of Georgia -

11:20 - Orcas off Comox.
We see three so far. - Update: Orcas first seen between VI and the north end of Harwood Island. What caught our attention was a lot of splashing (which we thought was the Humpback Whales we had been watching since around
9:00 a.m.). The orcas moved south fairly quickly and we could see continued splashing and tail slapping as they travelled. -Patti and Mark Perepeluk
*

Entry 3:
San Juan Islands (T167s) -

12:05-

12:25 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #89: "Turn Point was considered a good potential option to re-find the whales, so Dave turned northwest toward Stuart Island. After maybe ten minutes of heading in that direction, he saw a large splash offshore of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. Shortly after, he spotted fins where the splash had been, and the encounter began at 1205. The whales were in a tight group heading north about three-quarters of a mile south of Tiptop Hill, at which point they submerged again before "Orcinus" was anywhere near them. When they came up after a dive lasting four and half minutes, they were closer to shore and still in a tight group moving up the
Stuart Island
shoreline. Dave got just close enough ..." [See CWR Encounter #89 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-89

Today we got to meet some new-to-us Bigg's killer whales, the
four T167s
who are uncommon visitors to the Salish Sea. They are seen more often in SE Alaska. This group of Ts broke off from the Stuart Island shoreline and swam directly at a freighter heading up Boundary Pass. Occasionally orcas will surf freighter wakes or even bow ride on large ships, but today, these whales just meandered right over to this ship as they zig-zagged through the channel, surfacing right next to it, when they easily could have gone in the opposite direction.

*

13:00 -
They've been zigging and zagging with 3-4-minute dives and worked the
Stuart Island shoreline up to Turn Point
. Now as of 1PM, heading back south and possibly to Spieden whence we picked them up having pinniped brunch.

10:30-

11:00 - T167s milling and killing in Spieden Channel
. My first time seeing this family and these kids are big for their ages!
----Follow-up to my 11/26 sighting of the T167's in Spieden Channel (San Juan Islands). Aboard Maya's Legacy, we were the first humans to happen upon this family of top apex predators in
Spieden Channel
on Friday morning. It was quite the ID conundrum for a while as these orcas are so rare in the inland waters of the Salish Sea. Coupled with their uncommon appearances was the fact that this family puts the "BIG" in Bigg's ecotype. We were convinced for a long time that the sprouter male we were looking at was more like 15 (he's ELEVEN!) and the calf was like a three-year old and it is just ONE! But April Ryan's ID skills were superb and this was later confirmed by other naturalists and CWR. When we arrived, the presence of gulls getting scraps and the tell-tale aroma of a fresh kill made it apparent that this family likes to eat. I believe they probably had another couple of predation events given the surface activity before we left them. It was one of the most fun encounters I've ever had as well because these guys would dive for 4-5 minutes and where they came up was anyone's guess. Zigs and zags were the order of the day. photo - "

T167A
is an 11YO sprouter male that will undoubtedly rival the largest Bigg's bulls when he is full grown." photo - "View of

Entry 4:
Central Puget Sound - At
14:20
I saw
3 Bigg's killer whales
heading west along
Alki Ave
., maybe 50-75 yards from shore just west of Cactus. I drove around the corner and caught them at
Constellation Park heading southwest
. By
14:35, they'd flipped north midchannel line of sight to south Blake Island. Long down times after that, last sighting
14:54 heading north just west of the Tango buoy off Alki Point. I usually don't even bother with my phone, but they were fairly close. I also regret not taking a few still photos. Video shot at
14:24. -Jason Lee Bell
[
I think you likely have at least 5. I see two females surface at the same time, at the end, and 2 young ones near the same time distance apart, and the bull. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

*

Entry 5:
14:00 - Just off
Golden Gardens/Shilshole Bay Marina
. Follow-up: I
think there were 5
, looked like they were feeding. Lots of birds on the water for a long while after they headed south. Thought I saw red in the water at one point. Thought they may have got a seal?? -Korey and Mandy Knote
*

Entry 6:
Central Puget Sound - ~

16:20 - [HB]
I'm fairly certain we had some
Anderson Island
folks see this whale today around
4:20. -Belen Bilgic Schneider
*

09:04 - Humpback close to Dune Peninsula Park in Tacoma
, it was just a couple feet off from Dune Peninsula. He hugged the shoreline east to west, then disappeared near the black-over-red cargo ship. -Jason Cook
*

Entry 7:
(San Juan Islands) - ~

16:00 -
We were alerted to the presence of a couple of
humpbacks just south of Friday Harbor
. In fading light about 4PM, with blows hanging in the chilly air, we saw Raptor (BCY0660) and another animal we were unable to ID. The second animal would not show fluke despite several surfacings and subsequent deep dives. They were traveling southbound in San Juan Channel very cozily side by side. It is utterly amazing how two animals weighing 30-40 tons each can swim in perfect synchronicity like the most practiced ballet dancers. Gal pal, male suitor or family member we may never know. But it was fun to think they might be heading to Haro Strait to join the singing chorus heard on the hydrophones as of late. -Debbie Stewart

Entry 8:
South Puget Sound -

16:25-

16:35 -
But it did seem like the [gray] whale was indeed in that shallower area I previously described. According to the timestamps on my photos, it appears we saw 3-5 surfaces from just before
4:25 to about
4:35. Then it presumably headed towards the eastern end of the bay [Oro]. -Terence Lee

REPORTS BELOW relayed by Belen Schneider: I spent 3.5 hours yesterday [Nov 26] with Shrimp and I have so much more information about what he got up to. He took us on a tour of Oro Bay, from one side to the other and back, with much more proximity to shore. I'll have map and photos later today, along with a few videos that may help with body condition and proximity to shore, along with another islander's photos who was across the water from me in a kayak, so we have two angles. In the meantime, here's the sightings I've had or had reported since the last one:

22:00 -
Paige reported, "Scrimp (my androgynous name) has been in one spot to the left of me for 20 minutes with no movement. If it was stranded, I would assume I'd hear splashing? (a few minutes later, she heard it moving and splashing right under her house)

13:38-

16:15 -
My husband David and I were on shore at
Jacob's Point Park
. When we arrived, [
gray whale
] Shrimp was already deep in the west inlet (Oro Bay proper) and further in than the
Oro Bay Marina
. We got some very close shots and then it headed out into the main bay pretty fast, across to Cole Point, stayed off the point, then came back along the shoreline of east Oro Bay - close to shore (within 100 yards, I'd guess), and then moved fast again across the bay, lingered in the middle across from Jacob's Point and then took off for the west shore, got very close again and by the time we left, it surfaced right in front of the old dock at the old store, way deeper in than I expected. As we left, it was headed back out of the depths of the bay at a good speed. Again, I'll map all this, but it was really interesting to see so much slow and fast behavior, close and away from shore. [Belen's firsthand report]

13:00 -
Paige deSaro Banks (Cole Point) messaged me to say [gray whale] Shrimp was in front of
Jacob's Point
, close to shore, going back and forth.

12:00 -
Bryan Schmidt at Jacob's Point Park: It's presently feeding just off the
south end of Cole Pt
. Watching from the brickyard. I can add a few more details. It was anywhere from 50-100ft from the end of Cole Point. We watched it dive to feed 5 times. Each time it was down for roughly 3 minutes. It would take 3-4 breaths between dives. Saw the fluke twice. Left at
12:30. Reports by & relayed by Belen Schneider
