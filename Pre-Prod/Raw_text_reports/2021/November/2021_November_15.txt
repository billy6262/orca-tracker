Orca Sightings for November 15, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
South Puget Sound -

16:30 -
From the east shoreline of
Harstine Island
I saw, and heard, a baleen whale surface in
Case Inlet
very close to Fudge Pt. on Harstine. Only saw it surface once, but size and shape were unmistakable. Seemed to be heading south. Was just inside the bay north of Fudge Pt. I stuck around till dark, but no further signs. From the shape of the back, I'm guessing it was a gray. Sorry, no pic. -Dave Berliner
