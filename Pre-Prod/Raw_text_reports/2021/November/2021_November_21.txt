I think there might be a second group? What I was seeing off
Zittel's
is too far out to be what Kim was seeing [from Cooper Point]. I definitely, for sure, saw a full body out-of-water breach off Zittel's.

14:43 -
Additionally, there are some off
Zittel's Marina
. Breaching even.

14:38 - [orcas]
With the cooperation of the sun lighting up blows, and binoculars, I can see them from
Joemma
, across the waterway between Harstine and mainland, direction unknown. -Melissa Bird

16:00 -
They are currently
heading south into Budd Inlet
- after crossing east across from Hunter Point, to Boston Harbor Marina (heading under Mt. Rainier) and now are slowly heading into Budd where I have lost sight due to stupid land!

14:50 -
There are five in this group as they headed north
out of Eld Inlet
passing my front yard!

14:35 -
They are
heading north out of Eld Inlet
angling toward Hunter Point. Still at a leisurely pace.

14:25 - Orca are heading south into Eld Inlet
. Slow surfacing series....lazy travel. Heading south on the Cooper Point side of Eld Inlet.
----NOTE! My husband has 6 fins/animals in several of his images. -Kim Merriman

07:30 -
I've had a secondhand report of orcas off
Hunter Point/Carlyon Beach
area (Olympia/Eld Inlet) at around
7:30 a.m. So timing would dovetail the sighting off Zittel's Marina/Johnson Point. -Kim Merriman

South Puget Sound -

Dave McGoldrick observed the whale in
Oro Bay
again.
*

16:28 -
It's back in the channel between the 2 sections of the
[Oro] bay
, heading into the marina. Also, the last nights I have heard it clearing it's blow hole. It was dark of course, but it's a pretty specific sound. I'm hoping it is OK?? It doesn't look very big, and it's staying in roughly the same place. Back and forth mid channel and in front of the point at Jacob's. Seems somewhat lethargic? -Paige DaSaro Banks

Here are photos of the
gray whale that was along Agate Beach Drive in Oro Bay, Anderson Island

Entry 6:
E Strait of Juan de Fuca/NW Whidbey Island -
I got your info from the South Whidbey Record. I believe I saw a Beluga whale last weekend. I was launching a kayak from my friend's house next to
Moran Beach a
nd saw it swimming north toward
Deception Pass
. My girlfriend spotted it too. It had a round head and the ridge on its back. I was a little confused because it was dark grey and I thought they are white but the other features convinced me it was a Beluga. The date was 11/21. -Bryan E (King Bee)
