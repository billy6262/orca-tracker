Orca Sightings for November 12, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (T36As) -
We spotted a
new calf in the T36A pod yesterday
from the M.V. Saratoga, Puget Sound Express! It's rare to be the first to document a new calf so we felt very fortunate to have this exciting experience, and it almost didn't happen if it wasn't for some unusual behavior from a bunch of sea lions at the south end of Lopez Island, Whale Rocks. The calf was
surfacing right next to T36A
during most of our visit with the pod, and it's very likely that she could be the mother. We will wait for the researchers to make that final determination on who the mother is, and they will likely need at least a few more encounters to make that decision. Usually, the mom is the one who the calf surfaces next to the most consistently in those first several encounters, but it's not always obvious right away. I'll be sharing the photos from our encounter to help them make that determination. At the very end of our visit with the pod It also appeared like the calf was nursing right behind T36A, and lingered behind her for a few seconds appearing to feed at the surface after T36A went under. Also,
T36A2 and T36A3 were back with the family again
! Earlier in 2021 this sibling pair (a 9-year-old and 6-year-old) split off from the family for a long stretch and they spent a lot of time traveling with the T137 pod instead of their mom. It's nice to see them back with the family again. All photos were taken with a super-telephoto lens (960mm equivalent), and cropped, and all whale watching regulations were followed. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, PSE

Report by Alisa Schulman-Janiger, California Killer Whale Project: - 12
November 2021 -
Offshore Killer Whales
Encounter
Total #: 80-100
On 12
November 2021, we arrived at 3646.45 N, 12154.55W at

10:59
. Approximately
80-100 killer whales were spread over 2-3 miles
, in at least 12 subgroups averaging 5-6 whales. We observed lots of tail slapping (aka lob-tailing, a favorite behavior seen during most of our offshore killer whale encounters) and milling. The whales were
moving west
, following each other. Some dispersed, some picked up speed with rooster-tailing and bow-riding, and others were very curious and dove close to the boat. Over the next two and half hours, new sub-groups appeared and others left (some headed SW and others NW). It was reported that some were carrying a shark carcass!
Among hundreds of photos that we are still going through, we
identified multiple whales including O87
(the first identified offshore killer whale in CA) and her daughter
O231
.Others present included
O77
and
O79
: this is very likely their first confirmed sighting in California! These
"O" (for offshore)
ID numbers were originally established by Graeme Ellis (DFO: Fisheries and Oceans Canada) and colleagues. We are currently working with Graeme to ID more individuals, and will do a follow-up post.

O87: The first known offshore killer whale sighting in California: in Monterey Bay during the ACS (American Cetacean Society) Biennial Conference whale watching trip on 6
November 1992, 29 years ago! Our CEO & Director of Research Nancy Black and Lead Research Biologist Alisa Schulman-Janiger were on board. They saw 20+ whales - including O87! Capturing IDs was very difficult, as they were racing at high speed during this encounter!
*
O87: Long-distance match! Alisa has matched O87 and her daughter O231 from Dana Point, California to the Bering Sea!

Fun Facts!

*
24 years ago, on 12 Nov 1997 - 50 offshore killer whales visited Monterey Bay!!
*

*
One of the last times they were documented in Monterey Bay was on 13
December 2016, when Monterey Bay Whale Watch drone footage captured them carrying and feeding on a sevengill shark: the first time that this prey species was ever confirmed!
*

There was a shore-based sighting in
January 2021, where we identified the female O111! Thanks to Kate Cummings and Tim Huntington for submitting those photos.
A fantastic, once-in-a-lifetime experience for everyone! Photo credit: Monterey Bay Whale Watch intern Ella Mckhann.

Entry 4:
South Puget Sound -

14:26 - There is a gray
(I assume from the blow) heading deep into
Budd Inlet
toward Olympia. Heading south. I have seen video (far away) and heard it. It surfaced twice while my friend was watching it. -Kim Merriman
