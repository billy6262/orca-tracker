Adventures for
November 29th: Our reports began with Shrimp at 8am in the middle of the bay, meandering over to Cole Point by
8:10. By

9:30
, Shrimp was deeper in Oro Bay (the west side) midway between Lyle's Old Store dock and the inner buoys, touring over to
between Jacob's Point and Cole Point by
10:45
. We picked up our zippy friend again around
12:15, where s/he delighted islanders with about an hour in front of Lyle's Old Store dock, swimming back and forth in the bay inside the Yacht Clubs' marina line, coming up about every 5 minutes. By

2:30
, I had made it to Lyle's Old Store dock and Shrimp was on his/her way out into the wider bay, near the outer red buoy. Shrimp went pretty far out past the red buoy - maybe 200-300 yards and did a lot of deep diving, showing off a lot of fluke, staying down on the longer side of 5 minutes with each dive. By

3:51
s/he was mid-channel of the inner bay, inside of the red/green buoy line and about 130 yards from the Jacob's Point shore (Marina Overlook). At

4:17pm
, Shrimp was ending the daylight hours back at the end of Lyle's Old Store dock, just as I saw him/her on Friday, and heading out of the inner bay by

4:30
. I'm so happy for all of the islanders who had the chance to see Shrimp today! -Belen Schneider
