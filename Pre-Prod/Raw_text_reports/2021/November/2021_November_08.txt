Orca Sightings for November 8, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Central/North Puget Sound (Js, Ls) -

17:46 -
Still no SRKW signals on the
BP hydrophone
, though ambient noise level is lower now... It seems they are loitering in this extended quasi-slack period. Will they ride the big ebb out, or fight their way back in to Puget Sound?

16:36 -
Still no SRKW signals on Bush Point hydrophone (just tug boat noise). -Scott Veirs, Orcasound/Beam Reach
*

16:30 - Orcas
still
south of Bush Poin
t in no particular hurry, foraging and milling, couple of breaches. One whale mid-channel turned south. Others trending generally north as light fades.
---- What a difference a day makes.. After Sunday's high winds and stormy seas, Monday brought forth calm conditions and the welcome news that
J and L pods had stayed overnight in Puget Sound
. Throughout the morning and afternoon, they slowly made their way north in Admiralty Inlet, foraging and socializing, breaching and spy-hopping, drawing shore-based whale-watchers from far and wide to the mesmerizing parade. The whales' arrival just short of Bush Point at sunset, with a couple of whales turning south as the light faded, raised the big question - would we have the pleasure of their company again tomorrow? (Breach sequence occurred in less than 3 minutes) -Sandra Pollard
*

15:53 -
Still viewing the whale parade from
Limpet
! Absolutely beautiful in the sunset. Lots of rolls and slaps. We think the last of them are going by now.

15:03 - Several more approaching Limpet
.

15:00 - 12-15 orcas
have passed Limpet Ln., NB. Pretty far over on Kitsap side. Saw a nice breach! Baby with this group. -Donna George
*

15:00 - 3 pm
, seeing leaders passing N end of
Skunk Bay area, headed NW
toward Foulweather bluff, way over on the Kitsap side. Watching from 1 mile south of Bush Point. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

16:55 -
Left
Bush Point Lighthouse
where about 6 or so folks were enjoying the amazing views of Mt. Rainier and Orcas at a distance. When we left, they were hanging out around the area circled. Hopefully they will stay in town for another day. So happy to see you all today!!!

14:49 - At Mutiny Bay
, Frank Robinson Park.
At least 2 Orca
coming around point,
mid channel! NB

16:35 -
I just left the bluff
1 mi. south of BP
. There are
a few moving very slow NB
pretty far out mid-channel.

14:00 -
Still gradually
trending NW
but milling and foraging as they go. Zero boats with them.

13:28 -
Seeing many blows spread out
between Scatchet Head and 1/2 way toward Point No Point

14:40 -
Still watching from
PNP
. There is a group foraging in the midpoint of
Double Bluff
near research boat and more in middle of Cultus Bay. Most others went north into Admiralty after we had some great passby's within (guessing) 300-400 yards of shore. Are pretty far over now.

12:40 -
Update multiple whales around
Scatchet Head
from Cultus Bay heading NW - I'm going to head to PNP, at Apple Tree Pt. now. - KOMO chopper is with them, plus research boat. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

~

16:00 -
Donna, Amanda, Teresa and her mama pretty much watched the trailers, around 6 of them,
both sides of channel northbound
with a few intermittent foraging stops. Line of sight was Limpet Lane public beach and maybe 1 mile south of Bush Point/southend Marrowstone Island. 2 large males in this group.

13:37 -
I think most are mid channel ish from my vantage point. I'm now at
Maxwelton
. I see the research boat and a few just passing Kitsap side of the Pt. No Pt. yellow buoy channel marker.

13:10 - Near Scatchet Head
green buoy channel marker and still heading north. Group that I'm watching.

12:40 -
Viewing from
Scatchet Head
and see quite a few loosely spread south and north of Eglon and, I want to say, middish channel. The at least dozen or more that I have my eyes on are NW bound.
---- I absolutely love the fall color and Olympic Mt Snowy backdrops. Also, the pinkish skies that reflected onto the waters, sun was going down, photos taken from 2-4. Most taken from
Limpet Ln
area. At the same time, we were seeing
orcas south of Double Bluff
in line with Hansville and blows about 1 mile south of southern tip of Marrowstone. That is probably like 5-7 mile spread south to north. Many of the orcas were mid channel with some on Kitsap side and some on Whidbey side. To see the Residents fills my heart with joy...and they all looked pretty happy out there. Most photos are zoomed, most are cropped. -Marilyn Armbruster

spread from north Edmonds to tip of Whidbey

UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Mon, Nov 8 - Central/South Puget Sound - Mary Moreno called to report a whale and was wondering if beluga is still here. Whale was described as light gray, bulbous head. Surfaced 4 times then went on a dive and was down for some time. She saw it surface again, same surface dive pattern further south. She did see a spout that time. Location was the very
south end of Colvos Passage off Sunrise Beach Park
. The whale was southbound close to Kitsap shoreline. Sighting was somewhere around 11-Noon. Follow-up call: She did say
could have been a Gray
when asked about that possibility based on her description. No photos or video.
