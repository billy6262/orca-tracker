Orca Sightings for November 9, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound (Js, Ls)
- Here's a glimpse of a few members of J and L pods taken today - from several locations. Looks like they
headed out of Admiralty Inlet
in wickedly windy conditions, they were probably loving it. After 3 days of looking for them, these are the best pics I could muster, along with a few of our other beautiful local residents. -Jill Hein

12:45 - [orcas]
Seeing dorsal fins at
Ebey's Landing
. Breaching, but moving fast. -Molly Manfredo DeCroes
*

12:19 - [orcas] Good calls at Port Townsend
. -Jim Pasola
*

12:10 - [orcas]
Viewing from
Fort Worden
. Multiple fins and blows heading north,
approaching PT to Coupeville ferry lane
. -Jesse Avery
*
12.37 - Orcas
are passing
Point Wilson fast northbound
. Viewing from Fort Casey. Some whales trending more in the direction of Protection Island so maybe the pods are splitting.
12.07 - [orcas]
Spotted two blows and dorsal of adult male northbound Whidbey side passing Coupeville ferry dock. Viewing from boat ramp at state park. ---- Rolling seas and flying spume accompanied
members of J and L pods
as they passed Bush Point mid-morning on their northbound exit from Admiralty Inlet, following a three-day sojourn in Puget Sound. The tumultuous conditions (with a typhoon warning to the south), made spotting the whales challenging, but
J26's (Mike)
distinctive leaning dorsal fin and open saddle patch was visible among the whitecaps. With the whales moving fast, timing was of the essence to reach Fort Casey in hopes of seeing them from a higher vantage point. We were not disappointed - at least a dozen streamed past Point Wilson toward the open water and their next destination. Wherever that may be, here's hoping they find all the nourishment they need. -Sandra Pollard

11:40-1145 -
At
11:48, Kit Turner called. She is observing from the
north end of Lagoon Pt
., Whidbey. At ~

11:40-
11:45 she was seeing orca whales
heading northward
on the Marrowstone/Port Townsend side; there were many but she couldn't get a count because seas are so choppy. There was also a large male, mid channel, heading north. They all seem to be traveling quickly.
*

11:35 - [orcas] Northbound
, mostly, but a couple of turn backs. Must be fishing. -Bill Setter
*

11:50 -
Distant fins splashes from high bank
Lagoon Pt
.

11:10 - 2 males passed Bush Pt
., mid channel, very windy!
---- Out to Bush Pt. and caught
J26 Mike
(I think!) and another male mid-channel powering north through very rough water. Up to high bank at Lagoon Point and saw a few splashes/breaches mid channel with
Ft. Flagler
in the background. Then raced up to
Ft. Casey
and just caught a glimpse of a few dorsals as they headed northwest. Some fins are better than no fins! -Bonnie Gretz
*

10:57 -
Hard to count due to chop but see
6-7 northbound
mid channel, halfway
between Marrowstone/Bush Point
. -Jan Bell
*

11:40 - CALLS ON BUSH PT
Hp NOW!!
~

10:45 -
We were on a zoom meeting so I only had a few chances to look, but saw several pods/groups of orcas bunched up much more than yesterday, in fast travel mode - they were all past us by ~
10:45. I would guess there were at least two dozen, but given I wasn't able to watch continuously, and was challenged by huge white caps and sunglare, that is a guess. They were definitely in travel mode, headed NW out of Admiralty fast!

10:20 -
Looks like
Js & Ls went up Admiralty Inle
t! We are seeing orcas spread all over about one mile south of Bush Point out front ON headquarters heading NW in travel mode moving fairly quickly. -Susan Berta and Howard Garrett, Orca Network

09:40 -
Heard what sounded like faint
echolocation and calls
but now boat noise is drowning it out.

08:36 - Faints calls and intermittent echolocation on Edmonds hydro
. -Ariel Yseth
*
At

07:45
Monika Wieland Shields reports hearing
L pod calls: S19 and S2iii (L12s)
.
*

07:50 -
I believe hearing faint calls.

06:00 - SRKWs are still in inland Puget Sound waters
! Hearing probable Js at least! Just before 6am, tuned into the new test
hydrophone in N Edmonds
, hosted by Orcasound - Listen for whales, and could hear what I thought was faint calls, but a tug was passing through masking the calls. By
06:15 I was clearly hearing
S1 calls
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
