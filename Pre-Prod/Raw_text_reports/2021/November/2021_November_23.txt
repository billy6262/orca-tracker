13:45 -
I was able to view the
Southern Resident Orcas
on Tuesday 11/23 from
Dune Peninsula in Tacoma
, I got there about noon, orcas were still far off in the distance at that point but steadily traveling south; they kept getting closer and closer but were all spread out from
Dalco Passage to Browns Point
. There was one large male that I mostly saw near Browns Point/Commencement Bay, and at least three other individuals (but very spread out so it was hard to tell, possibly more), one looking pretty young. A pair of individuals (one of which was the younger looking one) seemed to stay more in front of Dune Peninsula and Point Defiance and circling Dalco Passage. I had to leave around
1:45pm, but they were still all spread out throughout Dalco Passage and in front of Browns Point/Commencement Bay. It was an amazing day to be out there and to witness the Southern Residents; I will never forget it! -Sally Milligan-Smith

Trailers have cleared
Point Robinson
, large spread, porpoising southbound in small groups, some foraging in singles and doubles. Beautiful close pass this morning with these beauties.
----Tuesday brought just the Js to my surprise, but was able to spend most of the day with them in the cold late fall sunshine, jumping from beach to beach to catch a glimpse. The
Point Robinson
pass was wild, as they were porpoising so fast, it was hard to see them through the spray, but oh, so cool! Got a sweet picture of sweet little Crescent and a saddle pic of
J26
with a new big scar that I didn't see last year, making him all the more handsome. photo - J41 & J58 ID: Brendon Bissonnette -Marla Smith

Entry 5:
South Puget Sound -

16:51 -
deeper in the bay. Foraging. Down between 2-5 minutes, usually 3-4 breaths when up, had 5 twice. We watched for 45 minutes with 10-12 surfaces.

16:00 -
I have the
gray in Oro Bay
right now. At 4, we were on the beach at the far side near west Oro Bay when I heard a blow. The second time I heard it, I saw it's back and we hauled it down the beach.
----Today was a joy, through and through. In recent days, we've had a juvenile (I think)
gray whale visiting Oro Bay
to forage. It was a gloriously sunny day, so we picked Jacob's Point Park to hike in, hoping that we might get lucky and see the whale from one of its many overlooks onto the bay. We hiked the whole shoreline with no sightings from 3pm on, and at 4, we found ourselves on the beach on the West side. I heard a blow but thought it might just be a seal surfacing. Then I heard another and saw the gray's back about halfway up the beach from where we came. We hauled it down the beach and spent the next 45 minutes at eye level with this beautiful creature before hopping up onto the bluff for some final fading light surfaces. I couldn't stop grinning as we hiked the mile back to the car in the dark. I have a feeling that this whale might be coming to the bay to forage when tide is 9+ feet (it arrived around that level as tide was rising). It certainly seemed to be foraging, staying down between 2-5 minutes, taking 2-5 breaths when it was up. As it moved into the bay and the water got shallower, we stopped getting fluke views as it dove. -Belen Schneider
