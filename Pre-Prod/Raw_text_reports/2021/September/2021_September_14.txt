It was very misty out, not really fog but everything was soft, muted and grey.
K-Pod and L-Pod southbound at Edwards Point

16:12 K33 Tika cut across the water. As visibility quickly decreased, it was a guessing game who was who, so I just enjoyed the beauty of their dark shapes against the misty background. Photographed from shore.

11:38 - Center for Whale Research Encounter #72: "… He could see a tight group of females and juveniles south west bound and was able to quickly confirm
members of the L12's; L77 with her two offspring, L119 and L124 and L77's sister, L94 with her two offspring, L113 and L121.
After scanning around in the mist for the rest of the group, L89 appeared charging along up swell a couple hundred metres behind the gang and soon overtook them. It became clear that the rest were slightly ahead as they too eventually appeared.
L22, L85 and L25
were travelling in a trio, L88 was on his own, and
L54 had her two offspring
in tow. …" [See CWR Encounter #73 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-73 for full summary and photos]

It's always fun being on the water - and to find Humpbacks and Minkes was a special treat. Heading west to
Race Rocks
under overcast skies yesterday (Tues), we first spotted
a humpback
(ID'd by Bart Rulon) named Aerie, and a little further west found Hemlock who dove frequently, hence some fluke/ID shots. AND
two Minke whales heading back to Port Townsend
. Pretty cool - my first 2021 sightings of these whales in our local waters. -Jill Hein

MMY0080 (Hemlock)
ID: Bart Rulon

We found
humpback Aerie (MMY0106)
near
Race Rocks
(Victoria), who was not doing much fluking up. We then moved a bit west and found
MMY0080 Hemlock
, who was moving along just under the water, fluking up, then resting for a bit, then fluking up again. Caught up with two elusive minke whales on the way back to Pt. Townsend. So great to be out on the boat and to see these lovely big whales! -Bonnie Gretz
