Spotted

,
1:15. They also seemed to start hunting and then disappeared. Mainly 1 was milling around; only saw another pop up once or twice. They disappeared quickly after circling around a bit and a couple tail slaps. -Jessica Richter
*

14:35 - Southbound
. They are committed again to a southbound path of travel. Closely grouped together. They are still
north of Bangor
but getting close to it now. Mid to east side of channel. I can still hear them all breathing but the glare on the water is making it harder to follow them with my lens.

14:22 -
Moving again. Facing northbound but no real commitment on direction yet. 222pm. Lots of porpoises hiding out in the shallow by me.

14:20 -
I think they are sleeping or at least resting now. All grouped together at top of water and not moving much. Just floating slowly. Almost directly out from my location. No real direction. Mid to Kitsap side.

14:00 -
Yay, I see them. Still north of my location. Will send pic. Looks like a research boat with them now. Kitsap side. Very slow travel. Oh gosh I can hear them all breathing too! They are circling the research boat. A couple of tail slaps.

13:00 -
They started porpoising and then haven't got eyes on them again yet. They were straight out from
Squamish Bay
. Southbound. Jefferson (west side).

12:56 -
Milling around by the large buoy on the south side of the bridge. Still trending south but looked like they were really interested in something at the buoy. Lots and lots of circling around it.
1230 - [orcas]
They are just slightly north of the bridge now. Chilkat is with them still. They were milling around for a bit but seem committed to traveling south again. photo - last sighting before they took the dive to go under the
Hood Canal bridge
. They were ~3/4 mile out from me here. -Tisa Annette

Wow y'all, I came over to Termination Pt./Shine and got to see them go under the bridge and group up around the channel marker to hunt, just wow!!
