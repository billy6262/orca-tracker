Center for Whale Research Encounter #62: "… Around
10:30, the whales were re-acquired off the coal docks north of Point Roberts. The team arrived on scene at
11:18 and began their encounter. When the team arrived, the whales were very spread out, generally heading northwest. The team first found a trio of whales, which turned out to be the
J41s
, including new calf
J58
. After this group passed the team,
J40 and J53
began foraging in the area near the research vessel, followed by
J46, J35 and new calf J57
, also foraging, with J47 near by. J57 and J35 took a moment to socialize with each other near the boat for a before continuing on their way.
J19
was the next whale encountered, followed by J45. The whales changed direction, and began moving southeast down the strait. The team spotted an adult male a few hundred yards away. A distant photo showed that this was
L88
, a slight surprise as previous reports of the group suggested it was only members of J pod. L88 joined up with
J45
, and the two males travelled together for a while. They were soon joined by a third whale,
J46
, who stayed in front of the two others. A short way ahead of this group, the team located
J31 and J56
. L88 broke off from J45 and J46 and began following this mother and daughter pair. The team moved over to a group of young whales and sprouters they had seen in the distance. They found
J39, J44, L108, and L117
, all young males, socializing together in a tight group. Ahead of them was a single female,
L54
, confirming that all members of the L54 subgroup were present with the J pod members. …" [See CWR Encounter #62 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-62 for full summary and photos]

16:30 - Orcas South of West Point
. I and many folks at the beach and on the bluff saw three orcas frolicking about 300 yards SE of West point for at least a half hour around 430 pm today. Looks like they may have been doing that bubble fishing thing a couple times as I noticed them swimming in a tight circle on the surface of maybe 30-50 feet in diameter for 30 seconds or so with much white water in the center. Other times they would jump out of the water a bit or thrash around but mostly they were just swimming around and hanging out. They seemed to then head into
Elliot Bay
and came within a quarter mile of the SW corner of Elliot Bay Marina. We drove to an overlook on Magnolia Drive and I think I saw them then
heading straight south towards Luna Pt. in W Seattle
but they were far away by then and I'm not sure. There was a ~45' powerboat and a ~40' sailboat watching this event as well from several hundred yards away, too. -Eric (no last name provided)
