Orca Sightings for September 12, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCAS - Sun, Sept 12 - Haro Strait - The ideal ending to a perfect weekend was having them come by at sunset in two big groups - with all of
J Pod in one line followed by the Ks and Ls.
Absolutely breathtaking. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network
*
Sun, Sept 12 - Haro Strait (J pod, K pod, L4s) -
J-Pod, K-Pod, and the L4 sub-group of L-Pod (L4s, L47s, L72s, L87, and L90)
remained off the
west side of San Juan Island throughout the day
. This would be a
total of 60 whales
if all members of all expected matrilines were present. While members of all three pods were together, we only call it a "superpod" if ALL members of the Southern Resident population are together, something we have not (yet) seen in inland waters this year.
In the evening, the whales grouped up from
between Salmon and Hein Banks
and started heading north up Haro Strait. The first group was all of J-Pod together - a stunning sight. The second group was a mix of another 20 or so Ks and Ls. These whales all passed Land Bank and Lime Kiln right around sunset, still going north. There were two matrilines we are pretty sure weren't in this mix, so they either went north further offshore, went north after dark, or stayed south. After midnight, whales
were heard going north in Swanson Channel towards Active Pass
, probably some or all of these groups. -Orca Behavior Institute

19:22-

19:30 -
A second group from the south, the sea calmer now and tinged pink and orange in the sunset. This group wasn't as tight as the 1st group and in a ragged double line, closer to shore. They were members of K-Pod and L-Pod. The thing I take away from seeing them all together tonight is their familiarity with each other. They are at home with one another. A single family made up of individuals. Photographed from shore, 1 mile south of Landbank.

18:54-

19:07 -
The orcas came from the south side by side in a long line. They moved as a group, tight, their collective fins almost undulating. They were the members of
J-Pod
, family and friends, northbound 1 mile
south of Landbank
. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

18:28 -
The first big group of about 20 whales is up to
Kanaka Bay
. Still traveling close together. There's another large group traveling together further offshore. Also, about 15 whales or so. Also
heading north
.

17:46 -
One large group traveling together coming back towards
Eagle Point
. Looks awesome! Wow. They're coming in side by side and one big long line.

12:51 -
The first ones have passed Eagle Point. Close to shore. Whales are spread out from Eagle Point up to
Pile Point
close in and very far out.

12:28 - [SRKWs]
First ones are just about to
Eagle Point
. Traveling very slowly. -Chris Wilson

At

11:30 AM
today, Sunday,
September 12, 2021 I filmed two or three Southern Resident Killer Whales mid-Strait, southbound, from my perch on
Ten Mile Point, Saanich, BC
, approximately three miles distant. Here's a link to my clip: https://youtu.be/yR_gAlWjaNQ -Gerald Graham

11:22 - [SRKWs] Slowly continuing south past Land Bank.
----In addition to missing the Southern Residents so much this summer, I have also missed the excitement and comradery of watching them with friends. While we humans have so much to learn from these orcas, in many ways our little dorca community mirrors their society and culture. We greet each other, enjoy spending time together, and care for each other. We have our little ceremonies and customs (like playing Free Willy songs while waiting for the orcas), and we even have a dialect that others don't quite understand.
After months of waiting,
J, K and part of L Pod
are finally here, and what a wonderful weekend spent with them and the people who love them! There were so many moments of joy that I will treasure. Seeing my phone explode with messages and reports of the whales' whereabouts. Calling to people in the Lime Kiln parking lot and telling them not to leave because THE WHALES ARE COMING, and seeing their surprise and delight at learning that it's the residents, and there are 60 of them! Telling a mother with young children that the orcas are on their way, seeing the frustration of her kids standing in the rain waiting and asking if they can leave to get dinner, then hearing those same kids squeal with delight 15 minutes later when the whales came by, hunger and discomfort completely forgotten. Hearing the crowd at Land Bank cheer and clap when the Fish and Wildlife enforcement boat pulled over the recreational boater who just ran through the middle of a group of orcas with a young calf. Listening to beautiful calls on the hydrophones and hearing the blows of the whales from shore. Seeing a breathtaking close pass in the kelp - and yes I may have cried a little when my special little "nephew" J38 Cookie circled through the kelp and came back for another pass, popping up right in front of me.
These are the moments we must hold on to and rejoice in - the ones we used to enjoy on a regular basis, but have been so scarce in recent years. We must remember them during the long lonely months waiting for the whales to return, as a reminder of why it's worth the heartache and the frustration and the waiting. A friend and I said today that we wouldn't trade this for a million dollars. We truly are so incredibly rich already.

11:00-
13:00
, The Southern Residents streamed past for a full 2 hours. Estimated by Orca Behavior Institute as 60 members, the sea was dotted with orcas. The first tight group of 4
southbound at Edwards Point
were K26 Lobo, K38 Comet, K35 Sonata and K35's mom K16 Opus. Seeing the matriarch with those 3 males was stunning. (J-Pod, K-Pod and L-Pod, Haro Strait, SJI. Photographed from shore, cropped and enlarged.) Some highlights:

12:44 - J27 Blackberry
and a companion swimming in unison together are the last orcas to go by, out of sight by
13:00

12:13 - J31 Tsuchi and J56 Tofino
, together milling in one area for 15 minutes. J56 seemed more independent today, swimming in a circle away from her mom. She had been staying close by mom on previous days. Meanwhile orcas continue southbound in the near distance.

11:43 - K26 Lobo and mom K14 Lea
vigorously porpoising together.

11:10 - The K-Pod males
started fluke lobbing.
K35
rose so far out of the water that he flopped over sideways, belly up. Then the males began to breach. Firing off one after another, 3 half breaches and 2 full breaches. Orcas continually streamed past, some individuals far out, some close, some in groups and some solitary. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

now.

07:05 - SRKW
can be heard now on the

~

19:30 -
Seen about
5 or 6 orcas passing the south end of Cypress Island heading east

Still
northwestbound at Partridge Bank
.

11:22 -
Now they have
turned more west
. Northwest, really, from my map. Spreading out to hunt.

Sun, Sept 12 -
San Juan Islands/Rosario Strait (T65As +) -

18:30 -
At
6:30 pm Sunday,
September 12, we happened upon 6 orcas in Rosario Strait traveling together,
eastbound
. (Our route was south around west Lopez Island through Rosario Strait headed back home to Anacortes). We continued watch them for about 30 minutes. I have attached a video I compiled of our photos and videos for you to observe so that you may try to discern the location. In one photo you can see a ferry. And I believe Decatur Island is to the NW of them and that the whales are to the west of Burrows Island/Washington Park area. Email w/ YT link https://youtu.be/czeWTP_B96A -Marie Faires
