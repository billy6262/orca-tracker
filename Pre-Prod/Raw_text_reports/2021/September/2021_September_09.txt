As identified by Orca Behavior Institute,
K-Pod and the sub-group L4 of L-Pod
northbound mid-channel across from Landbank/Westside Preserve. They flew up the channel literally jumping over the surface porpoising. Their blows and splashes gleamed bright against the dark blue sea. They were traveling north to meet up with J-Pod and I guess they were running late. Or very excited to meet up again. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Center for Whale Research Encounter #68: "… We got on scene at 1640 about halfway
between Hannah Heights and Discovery Island
a little over the Canadian border. Most of the whales were spread out in singles and small groups heading quickly north up Haro Strait. Some whales were porpoising and, except for grabbing some quick pics as some whales flew by us, we were left in the dust. We were forced to play catch up for the first part of the encounter but we did see enough whales to confirm to us that we had K pod and the Ls that Mark had out west the day before. … There were several groups of whales milling and socializing in the Gooch Island area. We quickly identified some
J pod whales
mixed in with the
Ks and Ls
. The whales were behaving in a Superpod manner with tight groups of socializing whales spending lots of time at the surface. Several whales vocalized in the air. …" [See Center for Whale Research Encounter #68 for full summary and photos"] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-68

and a large group of Southern Residents reportedly inbound off the Victoria waterfront, Mark and Joe concluded that the 14 present were the only ones yet to move into the inside waters of the Salish Sea…" [See CWR Encounter #67 for full encounter and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-67

At least 3 whales off of
Hidden Beach
heading south. Heard them before I saw them. Saw 3 spouts very close together so assuming 3 or more. -Nancy Culp Zaretzke

07:00 -
I saw these
Orcas
when walking my dogs on
Hidden Beach
just after 7am. Absolutely breathtaking as the water was like glass with the sun coming up still (very little fog at that time). I definitely saw two but could have been three. Follow-up: They were fairly closer to shore so the last I saw it would have been Holmes Harbor direction (they went under and didn't resurface until past my view being blocked by my neighbor's tree). They definitely were going fast on a mission! -Ann-Marie Darrough

COASTAL ORCAS - Thu, Sept 9 - Oregon Coast -
~

11:00 -
I saw
an Orca
today, probably more than one. He (they) was/were just out from
Bandon, Oregon
this morning just after
11:00 a.m. They were about 200 yards offshore traveling north. A bunch of dolphins, at least dozens, were just off shore traveling north, and the orca(s) were clearly to me, tracking them. Thanks for what you do. I reported a sighting a few years ago. -Mike Claassen, Bandon, Oregon
