At

one orca between Alki Point and Duwamish Head
. moving in a SB direction. Vessel reports another group of five animals further north, also moving in a SB direction.

13:00 -
They are spread out now… 4? Still heading
south [of Blakeley Rocks
]. Midchannel. Still followed by San Juan Clipper.

12:52 -
They are still a little north of the ferry as they are lining up. (It got a little confusing watching them. I lost track of the other one in lead as they started to turn north and milling around. The second group was easier to follow as they were closer to the Kitsap side. Last I saw the first group was northwest of elliot bay marina area. a possibility of what just happened was that the first group spotted by
Elliot Bay Marina
turned north & met with the trailing male and joined together at that point. The timing on that would make sense.)

12:47 -
Heading towards the ferry leaving Seattle. Towards Alki now.

12:42 -
Big male is trailing a little but the others are grouped tight. Out from
Elliot Bay heading south
still.

12:38 - Southbound.
Viewing from Pritchard Park. They might be split up. Seeing others…unsure of number yet. In front of San Juan clipper. Off
Bainbridge
. Closer to kitsap side.

Only Saratoga is with them now… in front of
Elliot Bay
.

11:56 - [orcas]
They are past
Fay Bainbridge
now & heading south. -Tisa Annette
*

10:20 -
Sara Frey called to report this group is off
Apple Tree Point
, Kingston in general,
southbound
. 1 male was in lead, not sure where he went, and 3-5 others (females & juveniles) slow southbound and engaged in a lot of surface activity including 4-5 spy hops. Maybe on a hunt? They are closer to the Kitsap side, west of the southbound shipping lanes.
*

08:07 -
