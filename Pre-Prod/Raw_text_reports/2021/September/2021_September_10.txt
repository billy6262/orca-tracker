Center for Whale Research Encounter #74: "J
, K, and over half of L pod were off the west side of San Juan Island
since the early morning. One of the other single whales in the area was
L115
traveling by himself. This was our third encounter in a row where we have photographed
all the L47s except for L47 herself
. We had heard that a DFO team had not been able to find her from their field work out in the western Strait of Juan de Fuca earlier in the Summer. Unfortunately, it is indeed
looking like L47 is missing
. K38 soon joined L115 and the two began traveling together. Most of the K3s were about three quarters of a mile offshore of this pair. …" summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-74 [See CWR Encounter #74 for full

I saw
L86 Surprise! with her daughter, 7-month-old L125 Element
, swimming close behind. L86 slowed down and became completely stationary to rest, low in the water.
L125
moved a few yards away and began to practice fluke lobs, 3 of them. She popped up for a shorty spyhop and then flashed the underside of her little fluke, pale orange in the sun. After a few minutes L86 slowly continued her journey and L125 quickly moved ahead to mom's side and the two traveled north side by side. What a lovely little girl! (Photographed from shore.)

A group of people saw them off orcas ferry terminal heading up north, maybe into West Sound which is fascinating. We just left West Sound to the ferry and they are not here anymore! We couldn't tell if they would turn around or not! Or possibly Deer Harbor?! Very weird but I just saw a whale watching boat go up north in that area so maybe they are up there which is rare, I feel like!

Captain Jeff and Naturalist Ellie of Maya's Legacy Whale Watching happened upon a fun surprise yesterday in Rosario Strait -
a new Bigg's killer whale calf! The presumed mom is T99 "Bella"
. We've shared the news with researchers for confirmation. The T99's were seen on
August 15th with no calf present, so this little one is less than a month old. Welcome to the Salish Sea! -PWWA

Skagit Bay - ~

orcas in Skagit Bay
at

6:30 pm, his son Ray Jr. is out fishing and they have had
a pod of 3 females and a calf milling around Tulalip Shores

brand new calf T99E
per Jared Towers, Fisheries and Oceans Canada] -Karen MacLeod
*

12:07 -
Saw two in travel mode right at
north ferry slip
. They were very close to Whidbey. Should have been able to see them surface again but they either went on a longer dive or was too close to Whidbey shoreline to see from my vantage point. Looking like a track up to Saratoga. -Debbie Stewart

They were on fire yesterday [9/10] with all members participating in two harbour porpoise predations. -Simon Pidcock, Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay & Parksville B.C.

GRAY WHALES - Fri, Sept 10 - WA Coast - Hi there! At
Kalaloch campground on the coast
. Looks like maybe a
grey whale
. Really close to shore. Still breathing with blows. But seems to be rolling and on back most of the time and not sure if that's normal behavior.
Follow-Up: I'm sorry I didn't get any pictures. We were on the bluff so not on the beach. It was just beyond the first shore break and going with the current south. At times I saw both pec fins or pointed flippers. But maybe the whale was still on their side. I've just never seen that before. -Emmi Jensen
