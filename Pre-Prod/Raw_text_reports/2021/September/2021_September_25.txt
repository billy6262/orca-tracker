We were returning to port on
Hartstine Island
after an uneventful sail trip when we spotted
3-5 Orcas in the vicinity of Jarrell Cove
. They were meandering north in pursuit of a seal, and passed fairly close to our boat, breaching twice. There were at least 10 boats in the water, most keeping a respectful distance except for one power boat who got way too close. By the time the Orcas exited Pickering Passage, it wasn't clear whether they'd made their kill or were still pursuing their prey. In any case, once we docked we saw a very relieved seal swimming inside the breakwater-who we decided to nickname "Nearly Sushi." -Paul Murphy

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sat, Sept 25 -
Haro Strait
- What a day for humpback whale action!
Split Fluke and her calf
played like crazy during our trips on Sept 25 near the Canadian border. In the morning when we first arrived on scene with Split Fluke (crc-15671, bcx1068) and her 2021 calf we had no idea that we were about to witness such a playful interaction between mom and calf. We watched them slowly swimming along for about 10 minutes and then suddenly Split Fluke did a caudal peduncle throw (cartwheel), and her calf followed suit with a cartwheel of its own. For the next half hour, the calf went on a tail slapping and cartwheeling binge that made us all short of breath! Mom also chimed in with more tailslaps in the middle of her calf's most energetic marathon. Eventually both whales started slapping their impressive pectoral fins on the surface too. We even got a bit more of this playful action from this pair on our second trips of the day too. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist/Photographer, Puget Sound Express
