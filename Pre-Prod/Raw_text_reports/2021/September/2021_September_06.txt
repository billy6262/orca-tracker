============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCAS - Mon, Sept 6 -
W. Entrance of Strait of Juan de Fuca (Ks and Ls) -

13:00-

16:16 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #65: "… The encounter began at 1300 at 48° 30.7' N / 124° 49.6' W, with most members of
K pod
tightly grouped and charging north toward Nitinat on the Vancouver Island shore. The Mike 1 crew noticed several more animals ahead of the K pod whales, so they made their way there and found L25 and the L54s, including L88. The
L12s and L22s,
along with
L85
, traveled near this group as all continued toward the Island.
K16 and K35
were just ahead of this loose grouping with
L82 and L116
and appeared to be leading the charge today. [See CWR Encounter #65 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-65 for full summary and photos] [video] https://www.facebook.com/CenterForWhaleResearch/videos/190174606545426/

19:25-

20:00 - 1 mile south of Landbank - J-Pod traveled northbound
in loose groups after the sun set. Over a calm sea with no breeze, the sound of their breaths was strong and abrupt. The orcas were spread out with one group coming close in to shore, their bodies split the calm flat water turning it into dark ribbons behind them. Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

. Others visible spread to the north and south.

15:55 - Js spread between Eagle Point and Hannah Heights
, facing south but treadmilling in the flood.
----It was a
classic "westside shuffle" day for J-Pod
and a record-setting day for us with over 8 hours of data collection. We spent quite a bit of time with
J31 Tsuchi and J56 Tofino
this afternoon (all our viewing was from shore) and J56 was energetic, actively foraging and breaching several times. She does not show any sign of "peanut head" from what we could tell. While her designation as a "vulnerable whale" indicates she's at an increased risk for mortality, what we saw today gives us hope that she can make a full recovery. -Orca Behavior Institute

9:30 am. They were heading northwest. There were
about 4
