Orca Sightings for September 17, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCAS - Fri, Sept 17 -
Haro Strait (JS, Ks) -

14:15-

15:50 -
Spread out, orcas southbound 1 mile south of
Landbank Westside Preserve
. The group was active racing south, 4-5 breaches and half-breaches, tail lobbing, extended porpoising and a cartwheel far to my south. There were less white caps than in the morning but the swells and distance keep me from seeing saddle patches. I'm not sure if this group was just K-Pod or there were also members of J-Pod present. I photographed K26 Lobo southbound in the morning and traveling southbound again in the afternoon. I did a double-take. He must have circled back north again at some point.

In rain, wind and rough dark seas,

very quickly southbound
1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve
