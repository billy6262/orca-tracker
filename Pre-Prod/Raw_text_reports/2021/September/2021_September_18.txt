.

have come back around
Eagle Point

17:45-

18:10
-The orcas changed direction south of my position and came into view again at
17:45
northbound
, traveling past me towards
Edwards Point and Landbank
.

15:50-

17:20 - 3 orcas quickly southbound at Edwards Point
with 2 males farther out. By
16:20 16 orcas had come southbound passing Edwards Point, including
J47 Notch
. At
16:15
J56 Tofino
traveling quickly in front of and energetically leading her mother
J31 Tsuchi
, southbound.
J56
doesn't seem to be sticking so close to Mom. She's more independent the last few days and I take this as a good sign. Next came
J38 Cookie, J35 Tahlequah with J57 Phoenix, J39 Mako and J26 Mike
- all southbound. At
17:10, NOAA was using a very small drone to sample the orca's breath.

11:15-

14:15 -
The lead orca traveling northbound followed by many others slowly filling up the sea in front of me. Milling, foraging, changing direction - an ebb and flow of orca movement. None were very close in at my position and there were only a few brief lulls of activity. I didn't see members of K-Pod but many were far out. Orca Behavior Institute confirmed that L-Pod was not present. I saw Dr. Deborah Giles' poop-sniffing dog, Eba, in goggles leaning over the bow of the boat,
J35 with J57, J38 Cookie, J47 Notch and happily J31 with J56 northbound
. Interestingly I saw one orca lunge through the water and a fish flew up beside her!

07:35 -
A few
orcas slowly northbound
, milling 1 mile
south of Landbank
. One large male turning back to the south and soon the rest followed, southbound out of sight.

From the south at
05:53. Beautiful orca blows heard traveling north, 1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve. Continuous multiple blows. At
06:08 it was light enough to make out the trailing large male as he rounded Edwards Point. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Several orca approaching

Tyee Spit (Campbell River)
at
19:00PM. It took an hour and half for the orcas to get there from our first sighting of the group. Always worth the wait! photos -

bringing up the rear about half a mile back. Leaving the scene now. Did not see T65A5 but they were really spread so he could easily be here too.

and spread out.

is southbound off

UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Thu, Sept 16 - South Puget Sound - Were there any reports of a whale or whales
in Carr Inlet near McNeil Island
on Thursday? My son and I kayaked down to Penrose Point State Park and saw a large splash and a what looked like a spout in the distance (toward McNeil Island) but never actually saw any whales. Thanks! [Follow up:] The splash and blow were too large for a sea lion and too far away to have been seen if they were from a sea lion - I am poor at estimating distances but maybe ½ mile? I was thinking humpback whale but, as I said, it was not seen. -Tim Hoffnagle
