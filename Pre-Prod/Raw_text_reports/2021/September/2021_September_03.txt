---- With 5 matrilines around the area, I headed south after work. I was surprised to see boats close to shore at
Lagoon Point
, and I pulled up just in time to see the T65Bs southbound close to shore. I headed to Bush Point to wait for the T65Bs to head south. I also had a hunch the
T18s would come from the south at Bush Point
. Sure enough, I pulled up to the light house less than 5 minutes before Galiano popped up about 50 feet offshore, wow! They met up with the
T65Bs just north of Bush Point
then travelled north together. They passed by close to shore at Lagoon Point before pushing northwest towards Port Townsend. -Rachel Haight

16:00 -
I had arrived over at my parents' property Wednesday evening after dark. … Jump to Friday afternoon around 4pm… Their property is in a small community of North
Kingston
, WA. … I was just relaxing and enjoying the afternoon sunshine and glanced up at the water and saw the unmistakable black dorsal fins of orcas come up out of the water. I leaped up out of the lounge chair faster than I have in probably my life. I grabbed my camera which is always out on the deck with me. I bolted down the stairs and running into the house to announce to everyone that there were orcas off the property like a ten-year-old excited on Christmas morning because Santa brought him his number one gift. My Mom was the only one awake and my dad was off doing an errand. I took a few photos from the house deck and then decided I'd have a better vantage point from the property edge. I figure they were upwards of a mile offshore moving north. There was a lead boat and a whale watching boat behind at a safe distance. -Brendan Ramsey

09:30
sighting: At
10:55 Ken Preston, Sgt of the Yukon, called to report seeing orcas earlier around
09:30 while anchored off
Blakely Rock
, Bainbridge. Ken was
approached by 2 mature orcas, 1 female & 1 male
. The pair made numerous passes close to the boat, at times within 4-5 feet, both submerged and at surface. They'd then circle out around 100 yards then approach again, he thinks seal was near. It seemed like they weren't going to leave him alone so he left, they did not follow him. He is happy to see orcas at a distance, but 4-5 feet was little bit unnerving. Orcas looked plump and in good condition. As he was leaving the rock, he encountered two porpoise reported as Dall's, but he did not see white markings so can't say for sure if Dall's porpoise, he saw two more once he was at Blake Island, both at 200 yards, and both pairs circling around as if fishing. [he was not familiar with harbor porpoise and thought likely them since no white seen -alb]
Email Follow-up: Hello, I called in a sighting of two adult orcas, male and female at Blakely Rock, off Bainbridge Island this morning at about 0930. I'm embarrassed by my overall failure to get any good photographs, but I'm not accustomed to being so close to such large creatures. They both (separately) made many passes at my anchored boat (15.5' long cabin skiff) at very close quarters. . .mostly closer than 10 feet and only in about 10 feet of water. Anyway, here are the only three photos that might possibly have some identifying marks. The male's dorsal fin seems un-marked, but the female's does have a small nick in the edge, which might be useful. Both of them had some very minor scratches on their backs but I didn't get any useable photos looking down on their backs as they passed. . .I don't think you'll get anything from the photo of the flukes and I'm only fairly certain that was the male. He'd just finished a close-up pass and then went off in that general direction. . .but really it could have been the lady just as well. -Ken Preston

I don't have a very powerful camera on my phone….sorry this was the best I could do… partial fin of largest
orca…
looked like 2 adults and 2 juveniles… hugging the
Port Orchard
side, then crossed the passage to Fort Ward side. Never got very close to where I was standing. Ferries are being extremely cautious. At least one recreational boater was cited and ticketed for passing too close… I'm guessing that was the Bainbridge Police marine patrol who watched after them through most of their journey out of the passage. Thank you! -Deborah
*
The Gods (especially Neptune) smiled upon me today. I checked Orca Network this morning and found that there were
Orcas
close by. Found them by
Bremerton
and watched them from required distances for about 1 1/2 hours. Just finished tying back up to the mooring buoy and they started coming my way. Please excuse the salty language. This truly made my day. This was between BI and Illahee. [video] https://www.facebook.com/scott.macdonald.564/posts/10224213717323751 -Scott MacDonald

Almost on my beach, 7 am,

It was interesting the females were all close to my beach for a bit, the male(s) were out further. They all joined up when they got to my neighbors down a couple blocks. Fascinating! I just went out to lower my blinds on the deck and heard them, turned around and there they were! -Jan Fuller
