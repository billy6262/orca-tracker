Very distant blows starting at
17:56.
Southbound
, very spread out and so far out I could see them across Landbank to my north. I was mostly just seeing blows. The sea was choppy and in the low sun their blows were bright white. The wind took the blow exploding it out behind them. It looked like distant fireworks on the dark blue water. Just before
19:00 a few came close enough to identify and the trailing orca was reported to be
J27 Blackberry
(ID Ariel Yseth).

11:51-

12:50 - Members of J-Pod and L-Pod NB, 1-1/2 miles from Westside Preserve Landbank

Js and Ls. L72 Racer
was in the lead then L105 Fluke, J27 Blackberry and then a threesome traveling tight:
J41 Eclipse with son J51 Nova
, and sandwiched between them
J51's little sister J58 Crescent. J16 Slick, L55 Nugget with her son L109 Takoda, J31 Tsuchi and daughter J56 Tofino. J38 Cookie
in the trailing group. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
