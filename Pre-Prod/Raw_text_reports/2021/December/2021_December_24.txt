Entry 4:
Boundary Pass/Haro Strait -
We had a lovely visit with
four humpback whales
this afternoon, including
MMY0136 "YinYang", Big Mama's 2014 calf "Beak", and Divot's 2018 daughter "Olympus"
. The fourth whale never fluked. YinYang seemed to be acting competitive and trying to keep between Olympus and the other two whales, lifting chin and flukes up on nearly every surfacing. It was a really lovely encounter and another great Christmas Eve trip. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu/Maya's Legacy

We always look forward to our Christmas Eve trip and today was no exception! We found
four humpback whales
near
Turn Point
and watched as they cruised south. The lighting was spectacular and even though it was definitely cold on the water there were a lot of warm and happy smiles watching these magnificent creatures. -Maya's Legacy Whale Watching
