I'm seeing 6 or so heading
towards Foulweather Bluff

Residents. Hard to count because of the spread, but around 20, I think definitely not two full pods like yesterday.. [
"looks like
K12
to me" -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
]
----
K's
Friday pass on the other hand, was full of speed! They were very spread out and traveled at a fast pace, with very, very long downtimes. The spread was wide, as only a handful came close in, and they kept it that way for most of the day. The Colvos pass found them more towards the mainland side, still spread, with
Tika
meandering behind and giving three mighty breach/bellyflops in a row to our delight! What a handsome guy he is becoming, that dorsal is so bendy and beautiful. By mid-island, they grouped up and were porpoising northbound in an impressive line of spray and spouts as they marched north to exit Island waters. It was good to be with K's again; it's been quite a bit since they've made a solo run down here by themselves. -Marla Smith

Currently at the very
north end of Dabob Bay
. Still
northbound
. IDs to come in a bit.
----We had another encounter with a "rare for this area" Bigg's killer whale pod yesterday. This time it was the
T68C pod and we found them in Dabob Bay, Hood Canal
. It's always exciting to see orcas we don't see very often, and this family gave us some great views. This pod of 5 also has a calf born last year (2020) that isn't in our most recent ID guide dating back to 2019. Right towards the end of our visit with them they had a dramatic harbor seal hunt, and little T68C5 was getting right in there too. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound
