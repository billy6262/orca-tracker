I'm over on Wawa Point and haven't seen them since they went north past
Pulali Point
approximately an hour ago. My husband and I watched them with the binoculars until they went out of sight. At one time we saw 5 come at once, including what appeared to be a baby.

to Quilcene Bay right now! -Cynthia Canfield

Entry 3:
a whale today between Point Defiance and the Tahlequah ferry terminal
. I thought maybe it was a minke, but could definitely be wrong. It was way too long to be a porpoise, but seemed small for a gray.
Follow-up/description:
I saw multiple blows from far away, which is what first caught my attention. I never saw the tail, unfortunately, but it showed its back multiple times, a couple of times for long enough to see a slightly bumpy dorsal ridge and then eventually a small fin. I was pretty far out from it and without camera or binoculars, so I couldn't get any more detail than that it was a dark gray. Yeah, these were big, very obvious spouts, so no minke. -Lauren Holton (Comment in CRC53 arrival post)

Mark spotted two Humpbacks near
Denman Island
. Throughout the afternoon we continued to watch
three groups of Humpbacks between Texada and Comox
. There were
at least six Humpbacks
around all day. By our estimate, there were also over 300 Pacific white-sided dolphins that travelled north at
13:00. At
16:00 we also saw
a group of orcas head north past Kye Bay
. It was a full and enjoyable day! -Patti Perepeluk
