Entry 2:
Hood Canal (T68Cs) -
This family of marine-mammal-eating type orcas has been plying the waters of Hood Canal for a full month now feasting on harbor seals, harbor porpoise, sea lions, occasional sea birds, and a river otter. Yesterday,
December 17th, T68Cs spent the day in the
northern end of the canal
doing what orcas do: socializing, traveling, resting, and doing their part to keep nature in balance. Pam Burger, who was out with Puget Sound Express, so beautifully captured this family and the gulls who opportunistically feed on scraps. -ALB. -Pam Burger

They continued circling the same 1/4-mile area for an hour. We left them in the same spot we found them just off of
Bangor
around

2:15-
2:30ish.

13:02 - They're still circling across from Bangor. T68Cs must've killed something big, they are actively feeding.
---- 12/17/2021 on the Chilkat Express brought us into the Hood Canal near Bangor where we encountered the
T68C pod of Bigg's/Transient Killer Whales
. They were actively feeding from the time we arrived to the time we departed. We suspect they killed something large like a sea lion and remained in the same place feeding on the carcass for most of the day. The orcas' meal wasn't the only casualty either. As we arrived on scene, we noticed a dead juvenile Bald Eagle right next to the T68Cs. I suspect the eagle attempted to grab a scrap of meat from the orcas' kill and it's talons locked shortly before one of the whales grabbed the same piece of food and pulled it under. However, I have also seen orcas play with diving birds until they die and swat at gulls with their flukes, so it's possible the eagle's demise was a deliberate effort by young orcas testing their skills or learning to hunt. Since we didn't see the struggle between the eagle and orcas, we can only speculate. As you can see from the photos of the eagle carcass, it does not appear to have been bitten by the whales. All members of the T68Cs but especially the youngest member, T68C5, surfaced near the eagle while we were there but showed only passing interest in it. They did seem quite curious about the Chilkat Express or perhaps the humans onboard. We spent most of the encounter with our boat completely shut down (engines and generator) and the whales approached us repeatedly despite our best efforts to maintain proper distance. Just goes to show that these incredible wild animals are unpredictable and each encounter is very different. You never know what to expect from these intelligent apex predators! -Justine Buckmaster, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express
