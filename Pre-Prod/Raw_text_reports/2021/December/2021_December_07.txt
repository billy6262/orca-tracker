Found them tonight
between Twanoh & Belfair
. A lot harder to follow them in the dark so not sure if they flipped back to the west. They were heading east towards Belfair when I heard them. South shore. -Tisa Annette

Some orca action today while kayaking in
Union between 1 and
2:30pm
. Follow-up: They were traveling eastbound; this was after the bend of the Hood Canal in front of the Union/Hood Canal Marina there were
5 orcas total
3 of which were hunting together moving farther east and the other two were a good quarter mile behind them. I saw them again on my way home around
3 o'clock in front of Twanoh State Park
. As far as the distance, I tried to keep the legal distance but they were zig zagging a lot back and forth and just popped up right in front of me. I'm thinking they were hunting sea lions that are present in the area a lot. -Daniel Joseph Ferreira

Entry 3:
North Puget Sound -

10:30 -
We had a
gray whale
up and down feeding extremely close to shore off
Witter Beach Place, between Sandy Point and the Clinton ferry
. I only had iphone so photos aren't great but I will attach in case you can ID from the bit of pattern! follow-up: This was on Dec 7 (Tuesday) around
10:30 am. We first saw it heading north from the ferry, but it passed our little group of houses around Witter Beach Place and then looped around a few times while feeding and headed back south again. Was in front of our house for maybe 20 min all up. Would love to know if you find out more! We've had more whales - grays and orcas -- in our little area between Whidbey and Hat the past few years than anyone remembers having. -Lara Nolan

Entry 4:
8:45-
9:20
, I watched a pod of
dolphins in Crescent Harbor
on the seaplane base. If I had to guess I would say there had to be at least 10-12 possibly. Please let me know if you have any questions. Follow-up: I was not aware of the harbor porpoise! We are Navy transplants and have only been here for about a year. I took a few sketches because they were too far away to get any good photos. The dorsal fin definitely looked more like the harbor porpoise. But, the distance made it hard to tell and they were moving fast. I read over on NOAA's website that they typically remain in groups of 2-3. There seemed to be at least 10. Also, do harbor porpoises jump? At one point I went back to my original sketch and quit paying attention to them and I heard splashing. When I looked up I could see a couple jumping. -Hannah Sewell
