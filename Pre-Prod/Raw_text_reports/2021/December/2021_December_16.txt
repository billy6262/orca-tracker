Orca Sightings for December 16, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fidalgo Island (T49C & T49A2) - ~

13:12-

13:34 -
I was prepping for a 1pm-2pm class at Washington Park's boat launch when I got a text that someone may have spotted orcas off of
Skyline Marina.
I drove the park's loop to where the overlook looks down into Burrows Pass (SE part of the park), and sure enough,
two orcas were right off of Tugboat Beach/the marina entrance
making a lazy trek westward. One orca was a mature adult male with a huge dorsal fin, but I wasn't too sure, at the time, on the other one. I had arrived at Burrows Pass around
12:40pm and only had about 15 minutes to stay; eventually the orcas picked up the pace a bit, continuing west, and came right by (underneath the bluff I was on), Anacortes-side of the channel, heading for Fidalgo Head. I had to go get the kids checked in for class so I went back to the boat launch; as soon as I had them all we made a beeline with them down to Green Point (NW part of the park) hoping that the orcas might come around the corner and continue east. When we reached Green Point,
they were milling just north of Fidalgo Head
for about the first 5 minutes. We saw a couple of inverted tail slaps and some rolling around. Then the adult male (later ID'ed as
T049C
and then verified in my photos and using the Bigg's catalog) began breaching (three times total), and the other orca (
T049A2
) was throwing tail lobs repeatedly. For the next 8 minutes or so they spent more time under water than above, and when a huge flock of gulls and seabirds came onto the scene I'd assumed they'd likely made a kill and ate, though I never did see their prey. Afterwards they continued an eastward trek at an average pace and passed our growing group of onlookers right off of the rocks of Green Point. They couldn't have been but 50/75 feet from us. We watched as they continued east toward the Washington Park boat launch until they were out of our sightline. On scene time roughly
1:12pm, departure time
1:34pm. It was such an amazing experience, and two of our five-year-old students had never seen orcas prior to this. Listening to their squeals and watching their faces light up just added another element of magic to this close passby. So glad to finally have the Washington Park experience after being there so often but always seeming to miss them. -Amanda Colbert

A pair of
Bigg's killer whales (T49C and T49A2)
with a close pass along shore today! They travelled through our field site followed by some brief foraging before continuing on hugging the shoreline.

12:10 -
Elisabeth Jenkins called to report seeing
two orcas, including a male, in Burrows Bay
around
12:10. The orcas were in the northern end of the bay
towards Skyline Marina
. Very surface active; male was breaching, tail slapping etc. Last they observed, the orcas appeared to be heading out the north exit between Burrows Island and the S end of Washington Park.

15:45 -
Still in the same area right up against the east shore. It's like they have something cornered in the overhanging trees. They have been extremely stealthy and hard to follow. I've seen two for sure.

15:00 - [orcas]
Spotted them just
north of Eagle Creek trending southward
closer to the east side.
----They were staying low to and under the water. They really seem to be at home and were just lounging around while I watched. There were seals everywhere! -Jim Pasola
