Orca sighting about a mile
south of Bangor

15:33 - Four Orcas were in Dabob Bay
again, went north towards Broad Spit and have since gone south. My husband was out crabbing and they came to them, bumped the boat, spraying them and went under the boat. They had been sitting, getting ready to pull, when they showed up. We thought they had left the area by then. -Lynn Stewart

It was another day of
Humpback Whales

14:00 until we ran out of daylight at
16:26. The weather was poor and taking any good photos was next to impossible. Nonetheless, it is wonderful to have the opportunity to see the Humpback Whales from shore. -Patti and Mark Perepeluk
