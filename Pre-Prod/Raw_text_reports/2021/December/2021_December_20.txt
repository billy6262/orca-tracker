Entry 2:
San Juan Islands (T99s) -
Eventually picked up the T99s on the
North side of Stuart Island
hugging the shore. Heading west, they passed the Turn Point Light Station, crossed the border and approached Moresby Island. After a few minutes of westbound travel, they stopped and exhibited feeding behavior on the southwest side of Moresby. photos - "

HUMPBACK WHALES

Entry 3:
Haro Strait -

00:10 -
I was listening to the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
and listened to whale vocalizations for at least an hour the other night. Because I was listening so late, I actually fell asleep before the vocalizations ceased so I'm uncertain about the duration. This was on Monday 12/20, and the calls I heard began around
12:10am. The initial calls were overlapped a bit by a ship passing, but once the ship was gone and after a brief respite the whale began vocalizing more consistently. Heard several unique sounding calls, I am just a casual observer so that's as specific as I can be. Hopefully this is helpful in some way. -Janell Spirup
