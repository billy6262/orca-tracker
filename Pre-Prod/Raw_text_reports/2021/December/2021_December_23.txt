Orca Sightings for December 23, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T49A2 and T49C) -

15:21-

15:28 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #91: "At 1521, Mark and Joe identified
T049A2 and T049C
as the southwest-bound duo. They were travelling side-by-side from the VH buoy for Race Rocks. Just prior, the trio on Mike 1 had paused to document
a pair of humpbacks
travelling a reciprocal course to the bulls, and as both species dove it appeared that they were on a collision course." [See CWR Encounter #91 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-91

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T251) -

14:03-

14:32 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #90: "About seven minutes later they finally spotted what George had, and slowed to find a lone killer whale roughly 3.5 miles south of the webcam position at
Race Rocks
! Incredible. They began the encounter at 1403 just northwest of the VF buoy with
a solitary T251
, as the crew got one beautiful breathing cycle from him before a long dive and direction change." [See CWR Encounter #90 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-90

Welcome back
Little Patch #53 -
SO good to see you today feeding by
Hidden Beach, Saratoga Passag
e. Thanks for the heads up Orca Network and Nancy Culp Zaretzke! -Jill Hein photos "Little Patch's fluke (tail) in action. He is propelling himself along the sediment with mouth open, collecting shrimp and all kinds of goodies. This is a unique feeding behavior of the gray whales who visit our area each spring (The Sounders). Little Patch is the first to arrive for the 2021-2022 season."

Entry 5:
Hood Canal - ~

15:00 -
I think we had a grey at the
Great Bend in the Canal
this afternoon. The fin swooped back a bit, was not upright like an orca, and there appeared to only be one animal. Was heading south around 3 pm. Follow-up:
Minke
would be the closest. Fin was obvious, but further back than an orca, no white, and very grey, rather than black. And the animal was not massive, but not small. Slow moving while rolling along. It did not come up out of the water very high as it traveled, so we saw mainly the top, it's back and fin. It also would roll about 3 or 4 times before going under and staying down for several minutes at a time before surfacing again further south. Much larger [than a harbor porpoise]. I could see it near the South Shore at first, and we are on the inside bend of the Canal, up on the bluffs. Mom's got an incredible view of the Bend there. She caught the Bigg's going through a couple weeks back, too. See a blow?: Nope, not once! So maybe Minke! Mom will be fascinated by that! My husband found a YouTube vid of a
Minke, that's it for sure
!! -Kimberly Smith
