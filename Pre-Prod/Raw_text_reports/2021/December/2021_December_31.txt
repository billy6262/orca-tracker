Center for Whale Research Encounter #96 (continued): "The new group welcomed from Haro Strait proved to be
sisters T075B and T075C with their offspring
, including a very young calf travelling alongside
T075C
! The animal appeared just slightly younger than
T124A7
, with folds still clearly visible along the trailing edge of his/her dorsal fin, and it was glued to mom's side.
This youngster has been designated T075C3

Center for Whale Research Encounter #96: "As Mark and Joe arrived, they had observed two groups of whales, one milling and one southwest-bound for that milling group. In hindsight, they realized that the group arriving was an additional one to what Mark had observed on the waterfront earlier in the afternoon. The original group of whales, the initiators of the sea lion predation, were identified as the
T068Cs and the T124As
. Both matriarchs had young animals in tow,
T068C5
being born in late 2020 and young
T124A7
having been observed for the first time last week off the north end of Vancouver Island by colleague Jared Towers of DFO's Cetacean Research Program and Bay Cetology." [See CWR Encounter #96 for full summary and more photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-96

Happy New Year! For our New Year's Eve cruise with Puget Sound Express, yesterday, we spent a little time with
two humpbacks [off Dungeness]
. They were staying mostly on the surface (sleeping?), not much activity or clear fluke shots. One had distinct scarring just in front of its dorsal fin - a series of 11 parallel scars (propeller?) The other's back seemed smooth with a small cluster of barnacles on the tip of the left side of its dorsal fin. Betsy Carlson, Citizen Science Coordinator, Port Townsend Marine Science Center

Entry 9:
Central Puget Sound -

13:57 -
My wife and I were walking along the Promenade at Pt. Defiance yesterday and a man there pointed out that he saw some whales out in Dalco Passage. I had my camera and aimed it out into the passage and caught the whales out in the distance. I know they were not orcas but wasn't sure what species they were.

Entry 10:
Possession Sound - At
14:54
Judy and Tom Nowack called to report at least one whale (possibly 2) swimming around
Port Gardner Bay
in Possession Sound. They didn't think it looked like a gray so are leaning humpback, but either is possible (definitely not orca). They are viewing from Mission Point, Tulalip, ~4-5km distance away.
