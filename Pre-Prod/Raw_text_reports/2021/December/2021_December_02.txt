Been viewing from north side
Alki
for ~30 minutes, orcas have streamed by still spread, heading northbound north side of point to south of or approaching
BI/Sea ferry
lanes. Seas are choppy on this side making for less optimal viewing than when they were on south side.

Js and Ks continue northbound
travels, spread out with at least some, including at least couple males, on east side of the Sound approaching Emma Schmidt/Mee-Kwa Mooks area of West Seattle on their way to Alki. NOAA out with them.

12:42 -
Don't see any more at or
south of Three Tree Point

12:42.

Some trailers at least off the yellow buoy at
Three Tree Point
breaching while northbound. Lead male continued and is ahead of larger group, larger group continued as well and slow/med pace with some directional changes and lazy tail lobs as they continue on to the north.

At least dozen, including 1-2 little ones and at least one male.
Northbound
under incoming rain...

Large group cut over the Sound and is off

A male, and he's turned in to forage perhaps...

12:00 -
Lead whale well
east of Three Tree Point
, mid channel buoy, steady northbound with little tail lob added in.

Amy Carey messaged: the orcas just
passed Point Robinson northbound
and said it was an awesome pass. And so now from across the Sound and through some trees I can see fins north of her/them at the point heading north. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Visible mid channel, large tug in middle of group now,
between Point Robinson and Gold Beach
still. -James Rempt

It was another wonderful couple days of spending some quality beach time with
J's and K's,
feeling extremely grateful to watch them foraging and frolicking as they circumnavigated the Island, some very soul filling hours keeping the heart warm in the bone chilling December wind. J's and K's northbound pass was a bit different, seeing them coming up from the south at that time, but hoping they filled their bellies on their way down. They seemed relaxed and contented as they made their way north, seemingly enjoying each other's company very much.
