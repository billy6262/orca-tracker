They are a bit east of

15:48 -
They are closer to south shore now but could see spouts. About a mile past
Belfair state park
. We are on north shore.

Lost them for a bit, they came up closer to South Shore side.

Still here.

15:00 -
Lots of tail slaps.

14:48 -
Lots of action right now, still mid channel.

14:32 - [orcas]
Seeing breaching. Mid channel. We headed up west from
Belfair State Park
. 8600 block, north shore. -Heather Berry
*

13:24 -
No direction at this point yet. They turned out & then back by the park. (They were mid channel but then were on the south side last I saw them.)

~

13:00 - [orcas]
Saw them about 1pm or so, pretty close to
Belfair State Park
from the opposite shore. -Bryan Owens
*

13:00 -
Possibly made their turn now.
Heading west
.

12:50 -
They made it all the way and are turning back west. Quite the current so travel speed is slower.

12:35 - Belfair State Park
. Still following current deeper in mid channel.

12:20 -
Signs of a hunt. Mid channel. The current is definitely pulling them a lot faster so having to calculate for that. Tough conditions for viewing. Choppy. Blows are way out in front of them by the time I see those, you have to pan back west to see the whales. Still
eastbound towards Belfair
