Center for Whale Research Encounter #32: "… The
four animals
were spread across 200m travelling very close to the shore of
Parker and Parry Bays
, and were soon identified as the T069As! Rare visitors to the Salish Sea, the T069As were last documented by the Center in August of 2017 when Dave Ellifrit was on a busman's holiday at the north end of Vancouver Island with Jared Towers out of Alert Bay. The T069A's are more often seen along Vancouver Island's west coast and the central coast of BC. Mark last encountered them over a decade ago in the Salish Sea. … [See CWR Encounter #32 for full summary and photos - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-32]

20:30 -
Passed south of
Lisabuela, T65a2
close to Vashon shores, others on the mainland side. Beautiful still waters and backlit blows. All
southbound
at a leisurely pace.
----Got a lovely late evening pass from the T65A's on Sunday with a nice knee melting mugging from ooxjaa/T65A2. What a hunk! As they came down the channel, he was zig zagging between the shore shelf and mid channel, Island side, with 6-10 minute downtimes, a bit hard to track until he got close. The rest of his family stuck to the mainland shore side scouring that shelf as they all leisurely swam south into the dusk. The still waters and sound of their breath cutting through the quiet evening made it all the more intoxicating. So grateful to watch the wild be wild. -Marla Smith
