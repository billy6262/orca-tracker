Orca Sightings for June 17, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Thu,

Entry 2:
Haro Strait (T18s) -

21:10-

21:15 -
Just at sunset with the waves picking up, 4 orcas made a dash northbound in the fading light 3/4 mile
south of Landbank/Western Preserve
. Using a tip from Alan Giles that the T018s were seen near Trial Island a couple hours earlier and some sketchy photos, I could make out the 2 nicks on T018's dorsal and the saddle patch of T019C. Really nice to see them fly over the chop with a faded sunset as a backdrop. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Center for Whale Research Encounter #42: "... The encounter started at 1258 maybe a quarter of a mile from the border off
Hannah Heights
. Most of the whales were in one large tight group heading slowly north. T65A2 and T37B1 were traveling and interacting with one another on the periphery of the larger group. They sometimes moved as far as a couple of hundred yards to the east of the big group but would repeatedly turn and approach the group again. Both
T65A2 and T37A1
would briefly join with the others throughout the encounter. The whales continued slowly up Haro Strait and we ended the encounter at 1500 about a mile from the border off Sunset Point. After we got home, the whales moved closer inshore and were only about a half mile offshore as they very slowly passed the Center."
