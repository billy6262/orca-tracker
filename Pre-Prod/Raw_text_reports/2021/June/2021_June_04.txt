Whales on east side of mid channel I believe. Can barely make them out from
Edmonds Marina Beach
. (North of ferry lanes.) I think trending west and south. -Sue Nilson Peterson
*
I'd like to report a sighting. From my house in the
Possession Sound near Browns Bay
, I saw not less than two Orcas. I contacted Puget Sound Express as I saw a whale watching boat nearby, and according to them it was T165 [was
T65As
]. I am quite sure I saw a second Orca, as the second whale that surfaced had a much smaller dorsal than the first. The whales appeared to be moving south. -Kashf Iqbal

~

15:45-

16:00 -
We went on to find the
T65As, T77 & T77E south of Possession Point
, east channel north of Edmonds around

3:45-4pm until about 6. They were very spread out traveling and looking for meals. Finally at the very end of the tour they began to hunt. Lots of tail flapping. They took out a couple seals very quickly and then we watched them celebrate several times with many large breaches and spyhops! It was like a gift, as we had to leave to get back to PT... The best goodbyes we could have received from these beauties! -Jessica Richter
*

15:30 -
Seeing one male from
Mukilteo Lighthouse going south
more on Whidbey side. Past Glendale. Long down times. Only saw the one. -Linda Aitkins
*

14:48 - [orcas] In ferry lane off Clinton.
-Robin Stangland
*

14:30 - [orcas]
Small pod spotted leaving the middle channel near
Langley heading south
. -Jamie Thibault
*

14:03 -
Pod is moving down
west side of Hat
, between Hat and Whidbey toward Clinton.

13:58 -
Orcas are back into hunting mode, so may have been chasing prey and slowed down again.

13:50 -
Pod on the move again toward
west side of Hat Island
. At least four.

13:47 -
Orcas have regrouped and are milling.

13:36 -
Now two blows so he has company again.

13:35 -
One male on a mission (presumably T65A2)
south of Camano Head
, directionally toward west side of Hat. Have not seen others.
---- There and back...there and back... That's the story of the
T65As
over the last few days as they explore Puget Sound. Once again T65A2 was some distance from other family members as they headed south in Saratoga Passage before re-grouping north of Hat Island. After milling briefly, the orcas picked up the pace and maintained their southbound route
between Hat and Whidbey toward the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes and Possession Sound
(images Sandra Pollard, zoomed/cropped). photo - "T65A2 rejoining other family members at
1:47 pm as they exit Saratoga Passage southbound." photos - "The long lens caught this reunion between T65A2 (b. 2004) and Mom T65A (b. 1986) during yesterday's encounter (see earlier post) when the whales regrouped north of Hat Island. T65A2 had been travelling separately from other family members in Saratoga Passage for some time, as he had done similarly in Port Susan two days earlier. It just shows that, although he may be almost grown up, he's not yet ready to leave home!" -Sandra Pollard
*

13:24 - 3 separate groups headed east near Camano Head
. One group is mid channel. One group is near Camano ahead of the other two groups. -Luanne Seymour
*

13:10 -
Big male is lagging back near
Whale Bell Park (Camano side)
and at least 3 other members are almost out in front of
Langley Marina
(mid channel). Still headed south, moving quickly when surfacing (except the male), and spending a decent amount of time underwater.

13:00 -
Spotted three fins just out front of
Whale Bell Park
, but more mid channel to Camano side. Still heading south and spending a lot of time under water. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network
*

12:30 - 5 orcas
heading south grouped close together. They just finished a hunt (seal & possibly a porpoise) and heading at a decent pace to the south...Tisa Annette
*
… We dodged our way through a maze of crab pots between Goat Island and Strawberry Point, then continued on towards
East Point
where we met up with the
T65As
! This note-worthy pod of Bigg's Killer Whales has been spending quite a bit of time in the Salish Sea of late. They looked to be busy finishing off a meal when we arrived. SR3 and collaborating researchers were on scene taking drone photos during the encounter; fun to watch research in action. Artemis and most of her kids continued south, while Calisto and babysitter Amira lagged behind. Calisto has been making a habit of this of late, trailing behind the pod after a kill while being babysat by one of her older brothers. …Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

. Two surfaces and then I didn't see it again. Follow-up: More off north end of
Kayu Kayu Ac Park toward Pt. Wells
. Hard to judge but maybe 1/2-mile [from shore]? It was through binoculars in my line of sight towards the orcas. Edmonds side for sure. -Kristin Kreifels

20:15 -
Saw on My
Edmonds
Neighbors, gray whale spotted at
8:15 pm off of
Marina Beach
Friday night. -Janine Harles
*

18:00 -
There's at least
one Grey
a couple hundred yards off the
north end of Richmond Beach Park
, as of
6:00 pm. It's been hanging out in the same general vicinity for about half an hour.
Follow-up at
20:01: A few times it laid on the surface for a few seconds (could see a good portion of its back), and a couple times it stuck the front of its head out for several seconds (I don't know if it was far enough out to be called spy hopping -- couldn't tell if its eyes were above water). The rest of the time it would take a couple breaths then disappear for quite a while; I wasn't timing the dives. I was watching for Orcas coming south from Edmonds at the same time. -Andrea Grad
