Orca Sightings for June 14, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia (T99s)
- T099's off
Campbell River
today: We waited at Tyee Spit for pretty much 6 hours for the tide to change and the T099's who were at the
north end of the Seymour Narrows
to swim on by..... and they did not disappoint! We saw them close to shore at Tyee Spit and then drove to the Pier only to watch them play with kelp as they hugged the pier! T099B Holly even swam under the top end of the pier! Thank you T099 family for making today so awesome!! -Ella Smiley, CVWS
