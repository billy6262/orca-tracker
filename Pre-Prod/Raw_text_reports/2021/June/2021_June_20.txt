surfaced close to shore at
Lagoon Point
on their northbound travels in Admiralty Inlet on Sunday evening. Some of the T37s were also present, though keeping their distance a little more. What better way to welcome the summer solstice...Sandra Pollard

Almost perfect timing last night, the whales were northbound and I had just a few minutes to spare to jump out of my car when they made a close to shore pass-by at
Lagoon Point
! Love it when they do that, love all of the 30 seconds or so it takes for them to thrill us all and pass on by!! Several of us were fortunate to see them,
mostly the T36s but also some T37s

Bush Point
