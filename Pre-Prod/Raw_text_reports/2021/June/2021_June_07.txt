Center for Whale Research Encounter #34: "… …Mark spotted a lone killer whale dorsal fin on the horizon! As the animal surfaced again, it was clear that the bull was traveling on a north-north easterly line toward Mike 1. They began the encounter at 1136. The bull was apparently just beginning his breathing cycle and surfaced several more times, though he showed little saddle patch in the swell. No matter, the familiar towering fin of
L85
is distinct enough! On his second cycle, the ID was confirmed, and Mark and Joe began scanning farther into the deep for more of the
L12 and L22 sub-groups

Mon,

Entry 7:
on Salmon! Two minke whales were zigzagging across the bank
, one appeared to be a juvenile while the size of the other suggested a probable female. Between sightings, we visited Whale Rocks where Steller sea lions, harbor seals, and a lone California sea lion were relaxing. These pinnipeds were also being watched by a mature bald eagle, go figure. The minkes on Salmon were showing off how they earned the nickname "Slinky Minke" so we continued south to Partridge. Here we found several more minkes, one which surprised those of us on the bow with an incredible close pass. While the bait was boiling, the whales didn't seem to be focused on the surface-active bait balls where hundreds of birds were circling. Instead, they meandered across the bank, keeping us on our toes. -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

MINKE WHALES - Mon,
June 7 - E Strait of Juan de Fuca - … Cutting into the back eddy to Cattle Point Lighthouse before fighting the flood out to
Salmon Bank
. One mile south of the green can we met
two minke whales
. One of them was our familiar friend who has a nick on the leading edge of the dorsal fin. We've seen this minke for several years now and refer to it as
"Minke Mouse"
. The other had a sharp pointy dorsal fin. We didn't observe any foraging behavior but while we silently drifted, they gave us some great close views. It was a phenomenal minke encounter. … -Captains David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
