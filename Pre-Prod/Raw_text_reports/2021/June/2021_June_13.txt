2:39.----Today's orca adventure brought to you by the words grey and rain. I spotted the orcas in Hood Canal from Big Beef creek and caught them a few minutes more south from Scenic Beach. The rain never stopped so visibility was difficult. 6/13/2021 from
Big Beef Creek and Scenic Beach after
5:30
. -Stacey Crofoot

11:20 -
Anna SinghDeo,
Bush Point
, called to report observing the orcas who are now
south of Marrowstone
. They have been watching the orcas for about 45 minutes. Pod includes at least one good size bull, and looks like a couple young. Rough guess, they thought they were seeing between 8-12 orcas [that we know of only members of T65As confirmed, 5 whales -alb]. Orcas on Kitsap Peninsula side, south of Marrowstone, basically milling. Earlier had been tail slapping and breaching (seeing full underside).
