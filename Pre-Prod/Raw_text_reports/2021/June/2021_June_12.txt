Fern Cove
, Kitsap side, 3-4 including male, stealthy hunting headed north towards SW ferry dock. ("Reviewing images, see
T65A, T65A2, T65A4, and T65A6
.") ---- Early morning pass means sprinting to my car and rolling up to the beach in my pajamas just in time to catch them! As soon as my boots hit the sand I could hear those giant exhales cutting through the morning birdsong as black fins rose in glassy waters. They carefully hunted the shores on the other side of the channel, slowly making their way north giving me some time to watch along with the numerous seals happy to be in safe in the shallows. What a beautiful way to start the day, loving their Island visits so much! -Marla Smith
