----Follow-up by HG: Thank you for sending this amazing video. That's highly unusual behavior but the orca and boat appeared unharmed. It would help greatly to know where this took place, and what time of day? And any other descriptive information you can provide.
Reply: Around
12:30pm, between
Camano Island's southern tip and Elger Bay on the east side of Saratoga Passage
. After the encounter he followed us for about 20 minutes in deeper water. I stayed in the shallows, not wanting a second close encounter. He played with the boat for about 10 minutes, going under and rocking, then pushing and then spinning us before he swam off.
----Further follow-up by ALB:
1. What was location of T65A2 first time you saw him and what direction was he traveling? East side of Saratoga Passage between south Camano tip and Elger Bay. 200' of water.
2. Was
12:30 when you parted or first saw him? When we first saw him.
3. Had you spotted and followed him along at all prior to him approaching you? No
4. What direction was he heading in Saratoga last you saw? South right in front of us. We were heading north.

passed so close and under our boat and proceeded to spend about 30 minutes in resting pattern. Was very nice to see. PSE is doing a great job following the guidelines and Justine B. was naturalist that day and was awesome!! Wonderful amount of education they are providing on their trips these days! -Sue Larkin
