split up but rough water conditions out by Smith Island made it too sporty to keep track of them. The last sighting of some of them was just

Sighting (received
09:40): Good morning, I just encountered
6 orcas
, heading
southbound towards Anacortes
, on the
east side of Guemes Island
, between Saddlebag and Huckleberry Islands, 9 am 6/18/21. I was headed northbound so we passed quickly and I did not get any pictures. There were two groups, two larger orcas in one, and about 150 yards away, a second group of 4, which included a smaller one (youth?). The largest one seemed more grey and black, not as white and black as some I've seen. -Happy summer, Keith Ronnholm
