Orca Sightings for July 7, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
B.C. Gulf Islands (T77C and T77D?) -
The T077s made their way stealthily eastward through
Active Pass
just before dark. At our viewpoint, one did the backstroke and one did a headstand (tail up). They were very close together, churning about in the same spot for a few minutes, blowing bubbles under the water. First time we've seen that behavior. Thanks to Rachelle of Salish Sea Orca Squad for the ID. Photos and video taken from the shore of Galiano Island. -Karoline Cullen

Had a fun day yesterday (Wednesday 7th) - we found
T49C
as he traveled north along San Juan shoreline, past
Spieden Island and on towards Battleship
. Then on our homeward bound ferry, the T037As stalled us right by the Lopez Ferry dock. Pretty darned cool!!! photo - "

Caught up with big guy
T49C right outside Friday Harbor
and followed him along the San Juan Island shore line for a while. He was just cruising along as we admired him. After visiting the exotic deer and quite a few turkey vultures, eagles and harbor seals on Spieden Island, we visited with T49C again as he passed Battleship Island. More excitement on the way home on the ferry, as the
T37As
crossed in front of us right at the
Lopez Island landing
! Just my second time seeing orcas from the ferry, and both this year! photo - "
