GRAY WHALES - Wed,

Entry 5:
~

12:45 -
I spotted this whale from land around
12:45 from
Port Hadlock
. From the fluke and dorsal ridge, I thought it was grey, but it was a bit small... It spent a lot of time in the same area, skimming the surface and doing short dives. Follow-up: We were on the shore of Oak Bay in Port Hadlock facing SE. It was headed East-SE but I don't know if it then headed into the Sound or toward Hood Canal. No photos, it was pretty far away. I only could see the spout without binoculars. -Jessica Rose

08:34 -
Unknown whale in
Hood Canal
, looking at it as we speak. It's on the east side, heading south. towards the Hood Canal Bridge. It possibly had a heart-shaped blow, but this is only my 2nd time seeing whales here, so don't quote me on it. (I think it might be a gray though as I didn't see a dorsal fin and it seemed to have a more spotted body and the blow looked kind of heart shaped.) -Sean Quinn
