T37A2 (Inky)
, a 12-year-old whose dorsal fin has sprouted considerably from last year, was having a lunge/breaching competition with his little brother
T37A3 (Spinnaker)
who has become a pretty spunky 8-year-old. The brothers took turns lunging out of the water, one right after the other, as they seemed to be egging each other on in the process! The youngest member of the family,
T37A5
, a 2-year-old, also got into the mix with some breaching too. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express
