My daughter and neighbors saw them in
Discovey Bay
around 700 pm. Sierra Sinkey said lots of tail slapping. They were farther in. About even with the WorldMark Resort but farther out towards the highway 20 side of the bay. (Sierra Sinkey added: "At one point they were pretty much at the very south east corner of the bay.") -Nancy Lindsley

GRAY WHALES - Sun,

Entry 3:
14:57 - Two gray whales
playing near
Ruston Marina in Tacoma
. In the muddy shallows feeding. Very sure it was two gray whales. Tandem heart-shaped blows in the beginning before they swapped to side feeding. It looked like they were heading toward the inlet by the mud flats towards Dash, boats were following them up. -Rheama Neas
