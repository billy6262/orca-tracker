Entry 3:
(T37As minus T37A1)
- A few photos from Monday's whales along the
west side of Whidbey
. So fun to unexpectedly see the T037As as they
hustled north and out of Admiralty Inlet
. These photos are from several viewing spots along the west side, and we kept 'picking' up more orca-dorks along the way. They were fairly close when passing both Bush Point and Lagoon Point - a beautiful evening too. Lots of spyhops! photo - "T037A (b.1994) named Volker" - photo - "This is T037A3 (b.2013) named Spinnaker" - photo - "T037A mom with I believe her youngest calf, T037A5 (b.2019)" -Jill Hein

A quick evening dash to
Lagoon Point
was met with the arrival of the rambunctious
T37As
intent on hunting down a seal for dinner. Checking out their quarry with numerous spy-hops, their united efforts were soon rewarded as evidenced by numerous gulls swooping for scraps. Energized by their meal, the orcas were soon on their northbound travels again, celebrating their victory with breaches and tail-slaps while porpoising toward the promise of yet another glowing sunset (photos Richard Snowberger/Sandra Pollard) -Sandra Pollard

Spent the evening with some of my favorite beings.
