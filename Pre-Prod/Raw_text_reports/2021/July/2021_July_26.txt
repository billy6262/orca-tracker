----All day I've been watching the sightings of this group as they headed south. I figure Murphy's law says they'll pass close by while I'm at work. Double Murphy's law in play because it's a rare day that I've left my camera at home. They're headed past Pt. Defiance and I have 20 minutes to go. Why are they going so fast? Finally...I'm off work. Where to go...where to go? South to Chambers or home to Fox Island?? Home and the camera win out. I head to the concrete fishing pier on Fox Island. A sighting update makes me think they have headed into Hale Passage but nothing to confirm. I hesitate to leave. This close to seeing them close in and I don't want to mess it up. I go back down to the pier to take one more look. There!! They are headed right for me. So close. Shoot....a long dive. Scanning. Crud....where did they go?...I hear them. I'm facing the wrong way! They're already southbound past me under the pier. So close. So cool! The park host said he saw them launch a seal before I turned around. Wow.....just wow! 7/26/2021

16:50-

18:30 -
Around
4:50pm from Dune Peninsula in Tacoma. The orcas seemed to be split into two pods and with what seemed like possibly 2 males and then another pod of 3 females/juveniles? I first spotted a male in front of the red container ship, with my binoculars. Then I saw the pod of 3, and they were more towards mid channel, both pods seem to be
moving towards point defiance
. I kept losing them now and then, maybe they were doing deep dives? I watched them move
past the Tahlequah ferry line
, and continue to the tip of point defiance, where they milled about in between point defiance and the southern tip of Vashon. I stayed there watching until about
5:30pm. Then I went down to Titlow Park and saw two orcas around
6:00pm right across the way on the Gig Harbor side of the Narrows. They started going north again for a little while but then turned around and continued south slowly and there was some splashing about. I left Titlow around
6:30pm and they were continuing
past Point Fosdick
looking like they might go into Hale Passage. -Sally Milligan-Smith

I submitted a report at
7:30 but I'm not sure if it went through. And an update since I'm here - the pod just passed
Point No Point
fairly close to Kitsap side, still
traveling south
. [Original reporting details]: It was awesome.
5-6 orcas, 2 males
; first spotted maybe
6:30. They were mid channel in Admiralty Inlet between PnP [Point No Point] and Whidbey, milling around for close to an hour. I don't know if that definitely means they were on a kill. Numerous spy hops. So cool. Definitely size differences between the females. They started moving and picked up speed passing by the PnP Lighthouse heading south. -Rod Lundberg
