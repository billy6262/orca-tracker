Orcas (NW) off of
North Beach today were the T65As, T37s and T34s (total 12 orcas).
They took down a harbor seal that had been hiding by the engines of the Maya's whale boat. Whoever was on that boat got quite the show today. Not much post celebration after the hunt/kill. They finally did some breaching long after the hunt when they started messing around with the rhinoceros auklets. Also some engaged in dragging kelp around on their dorsal fins. -Tisa Annette

Just spent a few minutes watching what I believe is a single
Minke
(based on dorsal and blow) heading north in Haro Strait off of the Lime Kiln point, about half a mile offshore. -Julia Vollmer
["A friend at the lighthouse just reported that she saw the blow to the north despite the breezy conditions, which does make me think
possible humpback rather than minke
! She was certain it was a baleen whale." Monika Wieland Shields, OBI]
