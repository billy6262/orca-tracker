That's when and where I saw them last too [

See them
south of Possession Point continuing south

Kim Page called to report they are watching some orcas far distance across from
Pilot Point (Kitsap)
on the Whidbey side by bluff. 4-5 orcas who look to be feeding and moving slowly south.

About
6:15 a neighbor that I trust spotted
orcas heading south in Hood Canal
, just north of Kitsap Memorial Park. I looked for them but the sun is a hindrance right now. The viewer is on the east side. I'm not sure how far out the orcas were. -Alan Robertson

midchannel favoring Whidbey side
between the north end Double Bluff and Hansville, SB
pretty fast. Viewing from north side of Double Bluff. I see at least 3. Too far for id photos. -Marilyn Armbruster

Saratoga found the Admiralty group and followed them from the south end of
Useless Bay to Possession Bank
. At the bank they spread way out and went on a deep dive and we never resighted them. These were the T34s, T37, and T37Bs. On the last dive they were facing east toward the mainland shore.

I have a second-hand report of orcas off
Hansville heading into Hood Canal
. MV Saratoga is on the way to check it out! -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

MINKE WHALES - Tue,

Entry 4:
Shark reef west of Dead Man's
and area just north.
Two whales
. All black. Short, well-defined dorsal towards tail, approx. 2/3 of the way back. Rolling surface then down, minimal exhalation, short surface time then dive 3-6 minutes. Size approximate large orca size. Time Tuesday
8:30 pm. -30 minutes. P.S. I have seen Minkes in Iceland but never here. Also looked at whale ID chart for comparison. Follow-up: No flukes when they dove, and the shape and dorsal was
consistent with Minkes
. -John Pohl FGS
*
PORPOISES - Tue,

Entry 5:
15:56 - HP
all over,
east of Possession Point
. Watched for over an hour spread wide! So much going today! Watched an osprey, blue heron, and eagle successfully fish. The seals and
porpoise were everywhere
. -Sara Bowen
*
UNCONFIRMED BALEEN WHALE - Tue,

Entry 6:
17:46 - I've got a baleen whale in Elliott Bay
. Saw when it was diving so couldn't tell if
gray or humpback
. It was off my starboard side; I'm driving the vessel Neptune's Car. I'll update when I see surface again. Follow-up: It was doing the breath hold Olympics. When we saw it, it was heading west out of the bay. I didn't see a full fluke and didn't spot the dorsal so it has me
leaning toward gray
. But my passengers and I only saw it that once. There was some chatter on the radio from the Kitsap ferries about it, but it must have been doing 30+ minute downtimes. -Joey LaMarche
