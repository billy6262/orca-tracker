NW Strait of Georgia (T2Cs, T90s)
- Encounter with the T090s and T002Cs, the Discovery Islands Resident Transients. They spent the day doing what I believe is a big sweep searching for dolphins. 5-7 knots just cruising past all the seal haulouts and working their way through all of
Bold Point, Village Bay, Open Bay, Heriot Bay
, right through busy Drew Harbour anchorage and finally back up the way they came finally falling asleep at around 4pm. -Nick Templeman, Campbell River Whale & Bear Excursions

Quickly found the
T137s by Lummi Island.
...we were first on scene! Lovely close passes (all photos with 300 zoom and cropped), especially with Jack, T137[A] (born 2002). They cruised in a large circle, then were
joined by 2 or 3 others (T36A2 & A3?)
, and after some logging, went on a hunt! Crazy breaches, porpoising, tail slaps, one great spy hop....poor hapless harbor seal was harassed for quite a while until they finished. photo - "
T137A, the infamous Jack
, born 2002" -Bonnie Gretz

We didn't need to travel far - just to the
SW end of Lummi Island
. They were spread out, but came together at mealtime. We were treated to breaches, tail slaps, a spyhop, and several of them porpoising around their ultimate lunch, a harbor seal. Such a beautiful day, too many photos, but such a wonderful treat. All photos zoomed and cropped. photo - "
T36A3
named Storm (b.2015)" -Jill Hein

11:00-

13:00 -
Six whales, including at least one large bull, on the edge of
Rosario Strait and Bellingham Bay
. They hung around two hours from 11-1, then slowly swam toward Eliza, then Vendovi, around Jack Island, then along the northeast coat of Guemes back toward Rosario. We watched them from a distance and only grabbed these videos when they finally got on the move and chose to come straight at us. At the time of the video [pixelated] the bull was over by Eliza Island on his own and these animals were swimming in his direction. -Cory Marshall
