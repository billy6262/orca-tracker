I'm watching it breach (assuming a
humpback) right now off the Alki Lighthouse
, just south but not at all far offshore. Has breached more than 10 times. It's headed south. I'm up on the Magnolia Viewpoint so can't see detail, but got blurry video/pics through the rain and distance of the splash! -Sasha Ertl
