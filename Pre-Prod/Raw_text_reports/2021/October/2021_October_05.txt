They are now approaching

07:15 - 3 orcas
, spread out traveling northbound, 1 mile south of
Landbank Westside Preserve

Attached is a photo I received last night of the

The tower is currently notified of the importance of real time reporting of this animal, and will call me directly/immediately if any more sightings are called in. -Julia Stockton, Temporary Bremerton Environmental Supervisor, Biologist/Game Warden, Naval Base Kitsap - Bremerton, Certified Natural Resources Professional --E via K.
