Then onward towards
Discovery Island
to see first time Bigg's whales for me, the
T252, T251, T253 and 253A!
! T251 is a huge beautiful looking male, born in 1982 so he's almost 40. He seemed to dominate most of my photos! T252 (female born in 1972) along with T253 born in 2001, and her calf T253A born in 2019. -Jill Hein

ï¿½we zoomed out to Hein Bank on word of orcas! This is the
T252 Biggs pod, with matriarch T252
, born in 1972 (49, so very young when she had T251), BIG male
T251
born 1982 (39!),
T250
(1989), her calf
T250C
(b. 2017), and
