Center for Whale Research Encounter #82: " Off the
north end of Henry Island
, Dave caught a glimpse of a few fast-moving whales heading north about a third of a mile to his west. The encounter began at 1007. The three whales turned out to be
T60, T60F, and T60G
and they turned almost due east
towards Spieden Channel
and began porpoising. Dave followed along and got a few shots of the trio as they sped towards the channel. Jane had said they had seen a male so Dave figured that T60C and maybe T2B, who often travels with the T60s, would be around somewhere. Around 1015, the trio slowed down about a
quarter mile north of Battleship Island
. About this time, two more whales, a male and a female, showed up about a half mile north of the others. This was indeed  T60C and T2B and they were slowly snooping around the north edge of Danger Shoal." [See CWR Encounter #82 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-82

I Just spotted the
beluga! He's in Commencement Bay
right now heading towards the naval ships that are docked. Viewing from the N. 38th St. Overlook on the Ruston side of the bay. I reported it. He stood out because he's so white! He is also fast so it's tough to get a good photo of. We reported the sighting immediately to the fish and wildlife and other agencies. Then we watched him for over 45 minutes. At first he was going toward dash point but then turned and started heading towards the navy ships that are docked.

Beluga
today, 10/9, at
10:40. Whale was heading
southbound under Tacoma Narrows bridge
, mid-channel. We asked level of confidence, and she said certain; and about possibility of Steller sea lion, she said no, whale was bright white. She's lived here her entire life and never seen anything like this. Whale was bright white, traveling slowly with regular surfacing and diving, could see body of a whale and could see entire time it was underwater.
