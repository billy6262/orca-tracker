Entry 1:
Boundary Pass (J pod) -

16:10-

17:35 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #84: " We moved about a third of a mile to the northwest to a pair that turned out to be J44 and J51 traveling together. Another third of a mile to the west of them was J39 traveling southwest by himself. We were still hoping to find J36 to see if she had had her calf but we couldn't find any whales on the horizon we hadn't been on yet. After a little looking we saw a male a half mile east of Turn Point near the Stuart Island shoreline. This was
J27
and he followed the groups ahead of him around Turn Point and into Haro Strait. We were not seeing any other whales in Boundary Pass so we decided to head down Haro toward home and see if any whales we were looking for had joined the leaders. " [See CWR Encounter #84 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-84 for full summary and more photos]

I don't think it's an orca, looks like possibly a small humpback? Wasn't sure where else to report it. I'm concerned it might be a young calf without a parent. Keeps breaching repeatedly. Near the grain terminal on
Elliott Bay
, just now. -James Parr

"Thanks for the report, James! We just received a call from a Marine Mammal Observer; it is a
humpback
." -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

We received a call (at
11:45) from Sam who has been observing a
humpback whale
since
11:25. Whale was first seen well within
Elliott Bay
, sighting line from Harbor Island to Elliott Bay Marina. Whale has been breaching on the north side of the bay, and is now traveling westbound, approaching outer edge of Elliott well on King County side of the Sound. Whale has covered a fair amount of distance since he has been viewing. -Sam Fason, Protected Species Marine Mammal Observer, on Terminal 5 Project for Port of Seattle
