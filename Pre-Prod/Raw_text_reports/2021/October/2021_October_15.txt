Orca Sightings for October 15, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T2Cs) -
On the way home [from Race Rocks], despite no known reports of orcas, we did find the
T02C
family and got some nice looks at them, with
big guy Rocky T02C1, born 2002; mom T02C, born 1989; Lucy T02C3, born 2011, and calf.
.. This is Tumbo's family (T02C2) who had scoliosis, and disappeared in 2019. They took good care of him since he was born in 2005 with this deformity. -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 3:
Haro Strait -

17:28-
17:37, The humpback BCY0785 Mathematician northbound
, zig-zagging then southbound 1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve. When I first saw him, he was very close to shore in the kelp. He submerged and when he came back up, he was about 250 yds out traveling south. He submerged and when seen again was farther out but had changed direction to the north again. As he approached
Edwards Point
(just before Landbank), he turned west, dove deep and I didn't see him again for some minutes. Then 1/2 mile out I saw a humpback southbound in the same area that I last saw BCY0785. I will assume it was him, this time heading back in the direction he came. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 4:
Race Rocks
in some pretty soupy water with gray skies. Caught up with
two humpbacks
who never fluked up at the right angle to get i.d.s. However, one did a massive breach which of course I didn't catch on camera, but did see it! We then headed west closer to Race Rocks and found
humpback MMZ0028 Dalmation
, who did show us his/her really beautiful tail fluke. -Bonnie Gretz
