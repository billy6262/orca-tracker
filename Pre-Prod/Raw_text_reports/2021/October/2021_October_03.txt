Orca Sightings for October 3, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:00 - We saw this guy in
Commencement Bay
, Tacoma, Washington. Any ideas? Looks like a
Beluga
whale to me. Location: Around LAT 47.287264 LONG -122.426447. [beluga confirmed by multiple researchers from Jason's video] https://www.facebook.com/OrcaNetwork/videos/229185192523265 -Jason Rogers

We saw what looked like an albino dolphin or small whale on Sunday in front of
Point Defiance
while we were fishing. Didn't get a pic or video of it but it was completely white. I fish out there every day and have never seen anything like it before. Any idea what it might have been? My buddy thinks it was a beluga but I can't imagine they would be this far south. [beluga in Commencement Bay on 10-3 confirmed by multiple researchers from video by Jason Rogers sent to Orca Network] follow-up - There was a grain ship anchored off the slag pile and it was just north of that. Mid-morning around 9am probably. [Gabe's map indicates location out from the
Tacoma Yacht Club
] [Gabe's sighting is not photo/video confirmed] -Gabe Miller

From Dyanna Lambourn via email: "Keith Gidball and his daughter saw the
beluga between Point Gibson, Fox Island and Toliva Shoal buoy around noon
on Sunday. He said they meet to leave to go out at 1030 at Chamber bay so it might have been a little earlier then noon.

Entry 2:
Fox Island
on Sunday?? I couldn't for the life of me figure out what I was seeing. I saw a bulbous figure come up and back down quickly, similar to seal feeding behavior. What confused me was the coloring. It was very light in color, almost a peachy/blonde hue. Too light in coloring to be a sea lion and too big to be a seal. -Dannyn Kaczmarek-Dybdahl

Probably
humpback calls (and whistles?!) on the Orcasound Lab hydrophone
(5 km north of Lime Kiln). Here's the single detection that fooled the OrcaHello AI into thinking SRKW's were present... https://aifororcas.azurewebsites.net/detections/detection/709c8675-1aba-44c4-9c0e-354276298018?fbclid=IwAR3TTAJYi-6Bj67rGB-0wdrbxxrwyzAArE-SXgBMsuj9e8Fzu9y6vc1Hubc -Scott Veirs, Orcasound

Not sure if they're the same
humpbacks
, but there are two approaching the

08:10 - 2 humpbacks southbound 1 mile south of Landbank, Westside Preserve
. The pair was beautiful in the early morning light, surfacing often and traveling close together, 300-400 yards from shore drawing closer in as they moved south. The trailing humpback had a small notch in the top edge of the dorsal fin and showed his/her fluke 3 times. Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

I am a frequent Hale Passage kayaker. My partner and I sit out in the mouth of Wollochet area for long periods of time because we love the blackfin porpoise. On Sunday around 1230pm I looked east between Pt. Fosdick and Fox Pt. and saw
4-6 large blackish fins.
Moving south. Then at least 2 headed to Zees Reef area. Not porpoise. I was too far away to positively identify them. They were big and not blackfin shaped. I can spot blackfin porpoise from a long distance on a good day. I think orca, but not positive. -lawest17
