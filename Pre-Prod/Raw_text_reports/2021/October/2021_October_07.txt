October 7 at 11-
11:30 heard something. He was sitting in his boat w/engine for about an hour, when he heard high pitched squeaks, it didn't register at first since sound was above water, but when he came back later and saw the research boats and helicopter in
Commencement Bay with the beluga
, he does believe that is who he heard.

Beluga
at
12:15 today (Oct 7)
along the Tacoma waterfront

2100 block Ruston Way
(approx. between Jack Hyde Park and Silver Cloud Inn). Whale was in Commencement Bay along Ruston way heading Northwest toward Point Defiance, ~ 100 yards from shore.

10:30 -
Robert Kerr called Orca Network at
12:30 to report his
10:30
Beluga
sighting. He's moored in the marina and was out salmon fishing in
Commencement Bay
when he saw a white thing a couple hundred yards away which he thought might the Beluga. The whale came up about 3-4 times, first time he could see about 4 feet of the whales back, and another time could see about 6 feet of whale's back, whale was snow white, definitely beluga. He then thought to try for phone photo/video while trolling 2-300 yards away, but the whale never came up again and could not find it again. Time of sighting was
10:30. Location was in Commencement, was near the 2 anchored yellow buoys. He was trolling toward the buoy right in from river; the whale was just outside the buoy to the NE of him in ~25 ft deep water. He had heard about the whale, but just this morning read Tacoma Tribune piece on the whale w/Orca Network contact info so had that information.
