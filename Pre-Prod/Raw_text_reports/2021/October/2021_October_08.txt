Around 2pm Friday, we observed
Orca traveling south between Fox Island and Chambers Bay
Golf Course. There were two very large whales leading the way and three smaller yet large whales together following the leaders. We almost think there was a 6th smaller whale with them but they were too far away and we did not have binoculars. There were 4 boats observing the pack at significant distances. Amazing encounter. No pics. They were too far away. -Paul Fournier

area at 2pm on 10/08/21. One large male (?), 2 med., one small. They overtook a sailboat, under sail in near calm conditions, 2 of the smaller ones seem to be playing near the bow. The large one came out of the water to at least half its length--i.e., "spyhop" ... We were a channel-width apart but it still looked huge. -Carl Straub

They continued on
past Langley
at a steady pace. Mid channelish toward Camano. Still loosely grouped.
14.15 - T137s have rounded Sandy Point
and are now
northbound in Saratoga Passage
. Not closely grouped up but not that far apart either.
---- Happy birthday to my grandson from the T137s today, cutting through the glassy waters of Saratoga Passage after bypassing Brighton Beach and Sandy Point. The orcas were initially tightly grouped after leaving the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes as they edged closer to Whidbey, but had split apart as
T137A (Jack)
sneaked around Sandy Point with the others more mid-channel doing their own thing. Well, that's what whales should be doing, isn't it? After passing Langley northbound at a fairly steady pace, the whales zig-zagged about for a while off Bell's Beach before
T137A and sibling T137D suddenly surfaced close to Fox Spit
, their exhalations like bellows, loud and clear. As always, such a welcome treat to see this fabulous family nearby on such a beautiful fall day. -Sandra Pollard
*

13:26 - [orcas]
Family in a tight group in slow travel mode just past

At
