Entry 1:

Center for Whale Research Encounter #81: "We headed south and found
J38 off the County Park
and then
J19 off Bellevue Point
. The whales stalled out about a quarter mile north of Lime Kiln State Park. For the next half hour there seemed to be a lot of foraging going on between the old lime kiln and the County Park as we sat about three quarters of a mile
northwest of Lime Kiln
. A few spread out whales passed us heading south but they didn't head south of Lime Kiln yet. One of these was pregnant J36 who was at the top of the list of whales we wanted to see in case she had had her calf. She did not have a calf yet but we are hopeful we will see her with it sometime this Fall. A few of the whales that had passed us to the south milled their way back north of us again as they foraged. J53 chased and caught a salmon near us. Around 1345, the whales finally committed to heading south and began making their way down the west side."

J-Pod
went north on the evening of
September 30, and must have been up in the Strait of Georgia since then, as this morning they were picked up
heading southwest down Boundary Pass
. Today we got to spend some time with this cutie,
J57 Phoenix
. He is an absolute ham, and we love him for it. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

17:45 -
Far to the south I could see 3 - 4 orcas NB. They swung out southwest away from the island. They were followed by a small boat with 3-4 photographers. There wasn't a research flag or Whale Warning flag flying. The boat followed them until it was a small dot in the distance. Photographed from shore, cropped and enlarged.

14:05-

18:00 - J-pod traveling generally southbound 1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve
, 1/3 mile to 3 miles from shore. They were spread out and changed direction many times, back and forth, in and out; some continuing and some staying in the general area.
J56 Tofino and J57 Phoenix
were traveling together some distance from their Moms. J31 Tsuchi was ahead and
J35 Tahlequah
behind them. The calves circled and dove and splashed and breached together! They were having the best of time playing. They decided to change direction and head back north but
J31
was quick to notice and she immediately turned back to catch up with them. Meeting up with J35, the moms gathered their playful calves and the 4 of them continued south again. Into the evening, at sunset, traveling solo J27 Blackberry,
J38 Cookie and later J26 Mike
slowly swam back and forth before everyone headed south. Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 4:
Haro Strait -

16:22-

16:33 - 2 humpbacks, northbound
, 1 mile south of
Landbank Westside Preserve
, 500 yds from shore. One was smaller, so I am assuming a mom and her calf. The calf was also lighter and a different color; a warm grey. The pair stayed very close together, their dives perfectly timed. As they approached Edwards Point, they lifted their flukes together. Their close connection was beautiful to watch. Photographed from shore.

14:00-

14:15 - 2 humpbacks northbound,
1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve, 600-700 yds from shore. The pair crossed the path of J-Pod who were very spread out traveling south. The humpbacks dove and stayed submerged until past the leading male. I don't know if that was coincidence or planned. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

10:37 - Two humpbacks
