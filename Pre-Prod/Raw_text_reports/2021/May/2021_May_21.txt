All photos were taken by high school student Faith Jayaram on 5/21 as part of a summer internship while with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. All pictures were taken between
4:30pm and
7:30pm, and the orcas stayed fairly close to the harbor for the duration of the tour; at one point, they were just off of

Fri,

Entry 2:
T123's Biggs orcas
, who we'd seen on our morning sail, were now reported as
Southbound at Jones Island
. We sailed North and met them as they rounded Yellow Island, also watched by a bald eagle on the reef. They continued South at speed on the ebb and crossed to Turn Island. They hunted harbor seals for quite some time again watched by a bald eagle on Turn Rock channel marker. They then changed course to head North and came in the South entrance of Friday Harbor. They travelled inside Brown Island surfacing next to the breakwater in front of a crowd before heading out the North entrance. There was a brief and energetic charge pitching a Steller sea lion into the air near Point Caution. The sea lion escaped and was seen close to shore while the T123's continued their travels North into the sunset. photo - "

*
Northbound on the flood and a nice close hauled sail through the
Wasp Islands
with bald eagles watching as we sailed between the islands. After we came through Spring Pass we picked up a report of orcas at
Sandy Point
. We met the
T123's
just North of White Rock and sailed alongside to Point Disney. They continued on the
Waldron shoreline
and we left to sail across Presidents Channel and follow the Orcas Island shoreline to return. Behind us the whales changed their minds about traveling north and remained near Point Disney for a few hours before heading South to Friday Harbor. A beautiful sailing day with whales. -Captains David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

After exiting

photo - "From noon. As they headed north from Carlyon Beach Marina - that's Hope Island in the background. I'm standing on the Steamboat Island Bridge."
photo - "At noon, the orcas headed into the marina at Carlyon Beach. Bull on the inside with the boats, females on the outside on the other side of the log boom - thick with seals. They tried to nudge them off the boom...which they were successful at doing. Here's the bull."
photo - "Here's one of the females. Lots of scared seals already in the water and under the bridge."
photo - "This was around
3:00 when they were heading out of Totten Inlet back toward Steamboat Island and the back side of Hope Island (where they hung out for a long time) before heading east toward Boston Harbor and Budd Inlet." -Kim Merriman
