12:00 - I was camping this weekend at Fort Flagler. I always spend lots of time on the beach and am always hopeful I'll see whales. I've seen orcas all over Puget Sound but never while I've been out camping and never from
Marrowstone Island
. Until Sunday. (5/23/21 12ish) Orcas passing my campsite at
Fort Flagler
around noon today. I didn't know if this was a new group or the one that had been on South Puget Sound all week. This group turned out to be a second/new group, the
T65As with some T77s
headed in. -Stacey Crofoot

While kayaking in Possession Sound at

Jetty Island

~

12:00 -
A little before noon yesterday, 5/23, I was looking towards
Pt. Wilson and Fort Worden
with binocs. The orcas and 2 ww boats were out from shore there. About mid channel it
looked like a baleen whale
about the size of a minke. It caught me off guard as I was focused way over. I refocused to see what it was. I knew it wasn't a sea lion as many hang out at FC. I never did see it again. I should have said something at the time altho it was not clear. But it wasn't over at Fort Worden, it was middish channel or so. And that's a pretty large channel there. -Marilyn Armbruster
