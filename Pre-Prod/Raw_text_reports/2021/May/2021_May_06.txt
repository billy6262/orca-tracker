Orca Sightings for May 6, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
14:44 - Report Tl'uk off Neck Point
Hunting about an hour [ago]. -Comox Valley Wildlife Sightings
[
The 46Bs and B1s were east of Port Angeles but 46B1B was not with them. If he was reported today, it will be interesting to find out who he's been traveling with! -Jeff Friedman, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

Thu,

Entry 2:
Admiralty Inlet (T46Bs w/o T46B1B, T46C2, T87, T125A and T128)
- We had a great opportunity to watch an unusual mix of Bigg's killer whales today lined up with the Olympic Mountains as a backdrop on both of our trips! We found the big adult bulls T87, T128, and T125A traveling along with the T46B pod just offshore from the Dungeness Spit. T87 is a lone male that mixes it up with other pods most of the time. The supposed brothers, T128 and T125A, travel together and we've seen a lot of them in this area lately. -Photographer/Naturalist Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

Through my photos taken during the whale watching trip today, I can confirm
T87, T125A, T128, T46Bs (exclude T46B1B), T46C2
were in this group. Follow-up: Yes, I saw the eyepatch of
T46B1
at least twice. Update: I scanned the photos again, I can confirm that T46B1A was there,
only T'luk was missing

20:30 -
My wife and I saw a group of
roughly a half dozen orca
, including a large male, off of the north side of
Port Townsend
around sunset last night (
8:30ish). We first noticed them around Middlepoint and then lost them in failing light headed toward Pt. Wilson (They were
traveling west to east
). We observed a group of about three otters head out to a large offshore rock (roughly 500ft offshore) and one of the smaller orcas investigated the area around the rock. Otherwise, the orcas stayed offshore at least a quarter mile. We think we could just make out some nervous heads of the otters on the rock; the light was failing. Also, some harbor seals sticking pretty close to shore. Seems likely that this is at least part of the group referenced below [by tug Cpt. Joh Gore, seen in Admiralty Inlet]. -Neil Harrington

06:45 -
John Gore (sp?), Captain tug Ocean Mariner, called while southbound
off Marrowstone Island
and passed
two groups of NORTHBOUND orcas
: one included a bull with ~5 smaller whales; 2nd group was stationed 200 yards behind lead group and included a bull with 4 other killer whales. Approximately
a total of 10-12
heading northbound in the southbound shipping lanes off Craven Rock, heading for Marrowstone Point and then beyond to Port Townsend. Orcas were running along pretty good; lead bull was kind of playing. That was
06:45 this morning, today,

14:30 -
Every year, for the past 6 years, we have sighted Orcas from our backyard. They were a little early this year. We always report them to you and hope maybe you can identify the pod. Today's sighting was approx.
2:30 pm on the
Siuslaw River in Florence, OR
. They only stayed about 20 minutes or so. Swam in a bit over a mile and back out. [video] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4oxate0rSk -Deborah Heldt Cordone

Viewing from high bank between Fox Spit and Baby Island, saw a

Saw the blow again at
