and more on the move.

14:12 - Orcas stalled out off Fox Spit
, still actively hunting.

12:50 -
At least one group of 4-5 Orcas steady northbound in Saratoga Passage heading toward Fox Spit.
---What a way to bring in the merry month of May, with the arrival in style of the T123s and T124A2s rounding Sandy Point, Whidbey, before entering Saratoga Passage where they continued northbound past Langley before congregating off Fox Spit in search of lunch. They spent some time actively hunting as a streamlined, coordinated group, showing the relentless determination for which they are renowned to wear down whatever prey they had in their sights, though it was difficult to tell how successful they were. No obvious evidence surfaced and, apart from terns fishing close to shore, few birds appeared. Even so, the variety of behaviors presented gave a fascinating insight into the intriguing world of the ocean's top predator, before they turned tail and meandered

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sat,

Entry 4:
Strait of Georgia
- Several Humpback Whales have already been confirmed in the Salish Sea this spring, but there is always extra excitement when
BCY0324, aka Big Mama
, makes her annual debut in the Salish Sea. Big Mama was first spotted by Humpback Whales of the Salish Sea contributor Maeva June off Galiano Island on
April 24th. Maeva photographed not one, but two Humpbacks that day, and although she saw them from a great distance, we were able to identify one as Big Mama. The second whale, however, was a mystery, and there was a chance that Big Mama had a calf with her. We knew that subsequent encounters were needed to confirm this. Big Mama's last known calf was Poptart, born in 2016. Then yesterday afternoon [
May 1st], Grace Guiney and crew aboard Eagle Wing Whale Watching Tours photographed Big Mama in the Strait of Georgia, confirming that no calf was present. However, Big Mama is looking as beautiful as ever, and everyone is happy to know that she is back, calf or no calf. We have documented Big Mama in the Salish Sea in 16 of the last 17 years, during which time she has had 6 successful calfs, and 1 grandchild (so far!). -Tasli Shaw, Humpbacks of the Salish Sea
