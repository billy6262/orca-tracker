headed toward
Snohomish Delta
near chip barge.

12:09 - CRC 531 off the south end of Hat Island. 185 feeding in Snohomish Delta.
1-2 more feeding far into the delta earlier today.
--- â€¦ As we reached the delta's day marker, we found an adult bald eagle and joined up with gray whale 185 as he was feeding along the outer edge of the shallows. After sometime we left 185 and went over to Hat island where we found gray whale 531 and she gave us some amazing looks. After many great looks at her flukes, we headed back over to 185 that had made his way back up into the delta and was quickly trying to escape the [declining?] water levels. We could see him as he was quickly swimming out of the delta because it had gotten so shallow he could not dive below the surface. He made his way to the deeper water near us and then headed toward Hat Island. He led us directly to 531 again and she came in for a very close pass!!! -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching

UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Sun,

Entry 7:
13:30 -
There may also be
a baleen whale near the Hood Canal Bridge
. It was a brief glimpse as I was driving, but I saw what appeared to be a grey peduncle diving. It was far too large to be the porpoise that frequent the bridge, but I didn't get a long enough look to identify specific species. Time was around 1330. -Kris Clark
