HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun,

Entry 3:
Thatcher Pass
, through the inner islands, and out Wasp Pass we went until we reached
Waldron Island
where
a humpback mother-calf pair
were chilling. It turned out to be none-other than Salish-Sea regular "Slate" returned from her wintering grounds with a new little bundle of blubber at her side. The calf was quite playful, rolling across mom's back and throwing its flukes at the surface. At one point, the pair turned towards us so we shut down and waited until they passed. They surfaced right off the bow, both mom and calf in unison, melting our hearts in the process. …Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

Green Point

Sun,
May 9 - San Juan Islands/Bellingham Channel - The fun started just fifteen minutes into the trip when the crew found

Unidentifiable
gray whale south end of Hat Island
.

10:45 - Gray whale 185 west side of Hat Island
.
----a.m. trip: We cruised out to the west side of
Hat Island
where we found gray whale 185. He was moving north quickly through many fishing boats and then suddenly put on the brakes and gave us some looks. We left him with the boats and circumnavigated Hat island to find gray whale 2356 feeding off the southern end of the island. We were headed north when we spotted 531 along the edge of the Snohomish River Delta and quickly joined up with her for some time. After a while 531 began to head back out toward Hat Island so we swung over to the Snohomish River marker to look at an adult bald eagle. We got some amazing views before the eagle took flight and we headed out toward Hat Island. We joined 531 for some final views before making our way back in to the dock. -Tyson Parker Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching

Entry 6:
Port Susan
where we found
multiple gray whales
in the middle of a feeding frenzy. We got some very close looks at
21 Shackleton
and also watched
gray whales 53, 723, and 44
swimming and feeding in the distance. Waters were raging and pectoral fins were thrashing everywhere you looked. … Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
