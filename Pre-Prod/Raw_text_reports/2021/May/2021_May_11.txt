UNIDERNTIFIED ORCAS - Tue,

Entry 3:
19:23 - Orca heading south from Savary Island.
Will update if I can confirm number. Update: The orcas I saw remained in the same general area for about 20 min. (
7:23pm-
7:40pm). They were far away, but I could see a couple of spy hops and I can confirm one orca with a large dorsal fin. At
7:40 the orcas began moving north from Savary Island. I continued watching from shore until
8:10pm and the orcas were still moving north. -Patti Perepeluk

Absolutely not confirming that it was Orca(s) but we did see a black dorsal fin surface roughly 7-8 times in about 10 minutes off the southern tip of
Ketron Island
today around
5:45 PM heading quickly southbound towards Nisqually. The fin was "orca-like" in size and shape, but we were far away (just got done kayaking) and even with binoculars couldn't confidently identify it as an orca. The fin did look larger than most of the porpoises I've seen. I usually see the porpoises in large groups north of the Steilacoom Ferry and Sunnyside Beach where multiple fins surface at once in a more "chaotic" fashion. This was different, definitely
heading southbound
and we know we did not see more than 1 fin surface at a time. Finally lost track of it as it got closer to Dupont. -Katie Dyer

11:30 -
This morning, on the west side of
Anderson Island
, south end of Key Peninsula -- basically in the middle of the water intersection between all 3 points of land there (Nisqually Reach Aquatic Reserve?). I watched them (from the air) for about 10 minutes and they didn't seem to be headed any direction in particular---just meandering back & forth in the middle there. It was a pod -- maybe 10 or so? Some large, some younger, occasionally disappearing, but surfacing a lot. Follow-up: No images - I was 1800' above the water so they would have been tiny in an iphone picture, but they were very visible to the naked eye! Dark colored, moving as a pod, and big enough to see clearly, so I assumed orcas. -Rebecca Graham

Just saw a whale spout east of
McNeil Island
, south sound. Not close enough to id. After blowing twice, I never saw it again. -Scott Perry

UNIDENTIFIED BALEEN WHALES - Tue,

Apparently, I missed the whale completely. A different neighbor's daughter watched it for more than an hour last night
WAY south into Eld Inlet
. Still trying for a good enough photo to ID as
either gray or HB.
It now makes sense that my husband thought he saw a foot print just slightly to the south of our house....but passed it off as the bait ball/sea lions/seals, etc. Which, when very active, leave giant 'prints' in the water. -Kim Merriman
