Entry 6:
13:30 - Humpback whale swam by Tulalip Shores
, in Port Susan today, Saturday, around
1:30 pm. We saw one last weekend too. Yes, a humpback because of that cute little dorsal fin (not a knobby spine like a grey), 3 breaths in concession, and then a deep dive with a wonderful tail shot. No swirling in the mud like the grey whales that visit. -Margie Eliason
