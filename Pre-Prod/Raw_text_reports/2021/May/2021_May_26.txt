â€¦ We met the two brothers,
T125A and T128, at Middle Bank
and sailed alongside until we crossed Hein Bank. We sailed North passing a large group of rare visitors, Sabine's Gulls, near Hein Bank who usually reside in the Arctic. There were some active bait balls on Salmon Bank but no sign of the minkes who were there earlier. Catching the tail of the flood gave us good speed past Whale Rocks and up San Juan Channel where water conditions turned to glassy finishing off a perfect day. -Captains David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
