about an hour ago. [~

Entry 4:
Possession Sound - Breaching Gray Whale
!! Sometimes we search for 4 hours and don't find the whales until the very end of a trip, and the reward can be amazing. Today was one of those days. Thick fog makes it very difficult to find whales and today had more than its fair share of fog in many of our whale hotspots. After searching far and wide for other species in that limited visibility we managed to find three gray whales at the very end of our trip today. All the hard work paid off with an amazing encounter with
gray whales crc531 (a female) and crc2356
(sex unknown). These two were swimming around with each other in a normal manner when all of a sudden crc2356 surfaced with a high arch of the back and a exaggerated tail fluke wave aimed at crc531. I was shooting video at the time and knew immediately to switch back to photo mode because something cool was likely to happen between these two whales next The other experienced crew, Captain Trever, and Tony, had the same feeling. Sure enough, in less than a minute
2356 came shooting straight out of the water in a big breach
and 531 surfaced right next to him a split second afterwards! We don't get to see gray whales breach here very often, but this one was definitely spectacular. Gray whale 2356 is relatively new to our area and was first spotted and given an identification number last year. 2356 spent much of the summer of 2020 feeding in the Snohomish River Delta. It was great to see this whale back again this year. -Photographer/Naturalist Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

12:35 - 531 has now joined 2356 and 723 between south Hat and Snohomish Delta
. eastbound, all 3 together.

12:02 - #44 Dubknuck headed northeast from Hat toward Port Susan
.

11:09 -
I am pretty sure the other one was 185, about 85% sure.

unidentified whale, all off the southern end of Hat Island. -Tyson Parker Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching

A slow moving
humpback
northbound 1/4 mile south of
Edwards Point, west side of SJI
. The humpback surfaced often but didn't rise very high out of the water. 400 yards from shore, it shifted close-in as it approached Edwards Point. Nice to hear and see. Photographed from shore, cropped and enlarged. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
