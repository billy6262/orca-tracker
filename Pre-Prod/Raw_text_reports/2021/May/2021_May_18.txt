Orca Sightings for May 18, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
3 T's inside Port Angeles Harbor
. By the time I got there, they were outside heading west. Stopped just a little east of the mill, doing a lot of surface activity. Assuming they were chasing porpoise or seabirds ...Looked like a mom, a young male and a smaller calf...one had a pretty distinct notch on the right fluke. -Alethea Leddy
[
Maybe the
T75Bs and Cs

There is a
pod of orcas in the Port Angeles Harbor
this morning. Couldn't tell what ones they are. I heard they were headed back out to the straits heading east. There's been some between here and Dungeness in the last few weeks. -Nick Sue

Center for Whale Research Encounter #27: … "There were no confirmed IDs yet so Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1140. "Orcinus" soon arrived on scene and the encounter began at 1200 mid-Spieden Channel. The attack on the sea lion was apparently over and the whales were actively milling and acting like they were feeding. There appeared to be
five whales
but the two adult sized females went on a long dive early in the encounter. A small whale was breaching periodically. Two other larger young whales were also charging around rambunctiously. These three were starting to look like
T46Bs when T46B herself and T46B2
finally surfaced from their long dive and confirmed that the whales were the T46Bs minus the T46B1s. The little breacher was T46B6 and she continued to breach throughout the encounter while the whales milled. …" [See CWR Encounter #27 for full summary and photos]

[T46Bs]
They dragged a Steller sea lion around (in
Spieden Channel
) for over 2 hours before finally destroying it. No B1s present. -John Boyd
*
…This brought us to
Battleship Island
where a feast was taking place. The
T46Bs
(and only the T46Bs upon review of photos) were busy destroying a Steller sea lion. We watched them fully skin this massive mammal and work to divide the meal amongst the family, letting the carcass float up to the surface before dragging it back down beneath the waves. Amidst this hunt, the youngsters were busy breaching up a storm. Massive oil slicks from the sea lion were spreading at the surface while gulls and bald eagles gathered to scoop up the scraps. That's right, BALD EAGLES. It was a whirlwind of activity, our eyes glued to the water, not wanting to look away for fear of missing a breach or tail slap. Little Sol (T46B6) really stole the show, not only was she incredibly surface-active, she was getting at the sea lion along with the rest of the family, and she's only two!...Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

at minimum 4 other grays around Kayak Point

Entry 5:
12:00 and

13:00 -
There were
2 humpbacks south of Anderson Island
, probably the same two seen entering Admiralty Inlet 2 days ago. We found them
south of Taylor Bay
passing very close to the Ts heading east around 12, then saw them south of Anderson heading SE at 1300. -Christopher Hanke, Puget Sound Express
*
UNIDETIFIED SPECIES - Tue,

Entry 6:
19:10 -
I'm not saying it definitely is the humpbacks but I've seen four big black blobs come up and go back down just south of
Henderson Bay
and heading north..too far away for me to confirm. They definitely weren't seals or sea lions, dolphin, or anything of that size. They definitely weren't orca, either. -Barb Horn Hartman

Admiralty Inlet - ~

19:20 -

May 18, approx.
7:15 PM. A
pair of humpback whales traveling southeast between Fort Casey and Lagoon Point
