3-4 orcas heading east just off North Beach
, Port Townsend. A bit south of mid-channel as they headed around the
Point Wilson
bend, it looked to be two males with possibly a female and juvenile. Some minutes later, a very large male surfaced roughly 20yards from shore (2 blocks west of North Beach Park), resurfaced several times, then went on his evening way. Magical mystery tour carries on...Annette Huenke

These Orcas came into
Discovery Bay
about
1:15 yesterday heading southeast until they got to Contracter's Point. They stayed at the bottom of the bay, whales feeding until about
2:30. …then the pod slowly started swimming toward
Beckett Point
, mid-channel. The biggest male came right next to the Beckett Point shore as they headed towards Protection Island. The whales fed out there until about
4:30 when they swam past
Diamond Point
very close to shore heading west towards the Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Karel Reeves

I'm near Joemma Beach and just saw a grey whale. it was
heading South near Joemma Beach out the Case Inle
t at 1420, today 5/5/2021. There was one boat following it; otherwise, it was just us and them. The whale was about 15-20 yards from the shore line, in pretty shallow water. -Melanie Boling

Wed,

Entry 5:
Possession Sound … Gray whales #723 and friend (possibly #56)
were socializing at the surface. We stopped to drift with them as they synchronized their breathing, taking in the sweet stench of whale breath with each surfacing. We noticed another gray whale in the distance making its way towards us. As it approached, the two we were with seemed excited about the appearance of the third (possibly #185), as they picked up the pace and bee-lined towards them. What unfolded next was nothing short of spectacular. The three proceeded to feed in the shallows off the southeastern corner of Hat Island, spyhopping repeatedly. Even the most novice photographers could have captured a spyhop photo today, there was plenty of opportunity. As the activity died down, we continued the search to the north of Hat Island and then into the Snohomish River Delta. We did find a fourth whale rolling in the delta, showing off pecs and flukes as it fed. We watched from afar, as the water was far too shallow for us to approach, a testament to the skill of these massive benthic foragers. Before heading home, we visited with the trio of grays one more time. They were lounging at the surface, lined up side by side. …Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
