Orca Sightings for May 30, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
(CA20 (T132), CA54 (T134), and CA177 (T237), T99s, T125A and T128)
. Sunday 30 May, Awesome Adventure: our California transients, off Washington/BC Sunday - VIDEO! Mark Malleson (Center for Whale Research/Fisheries and Oceans Canada) encountered six killer whales milling in Haro Strait on Middle Bank (USA/Canada border), including three of our less often seen California transients: CA20 (T132), CA54 (T134), and CA177 (T237) - a trio we had last encountered on 4
May 2021 in Monterey Bay! They were with adult males T125A and T128, and young adult female T099B. Maya's Legacy Whale Watching, with naturalist April Ryan, joined them around 11am. The males were initially very social, and then everyone spread out. T099B was with one of the CA females, and CA20 (T132) was following them. After 1pm, males T125A and T128 started to hang back and eventually headed west. The
three other members of the T099s - T099, T099C, and T099D - showed up when the group was zig-zagging back and forth over the border.
They stayed mostly on the Canadian side for the next several hours, and were visible on the Lime Kiln camera (San Juan Island) for about an hour. The seven whales were on the U.S. side headed toward Turn Point just before 6pm, and then turned left into Canadian waters. By
6:30, they had turned into Swanson Channel, and went though Active Pass (Canadian Gulf Islands). NOTE: Some of our California Bigg's transient killer whales have other catalog ID number designations; if they have been encountered off British Columbia or Alaska, they also have T (Bigg's transient) numbers. For example, CA20 (T132) and CA54 (T134) were spotted in Glacier Bay, Alaska in 1989 with two other whales, CA18 (T133) and CA27 (T135) - our only California transients ever confirmed in Alaska! VIDEO from Sunday, in Active Pass! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRQg4n4Eoqg.

Seeing May out with transient orcas just as we saw the month in with them. The
T65As, T77 and T77E
graced the shores of Whidbey Island, tightly grouped as they passed
Brighton Beach
this morning. Impressive as ever, the orcas were a wonderful sight to behold whether seen from the ferries, the shore or from the water, as they wended their way navigating the eddies and currents of Saratoga Passage before continuing
northbound closer to Camano Island

orcas just north of the Clinton ferry dock
still aiming towards Saratoga Passage.

10:50 -
Had to honk at a boat and get on the loud speaker to stop them from motoring right in front of the whales. PWWA alerted both ferry boats with our help so that they could swing widely around the orcas today when they were swimming in the ferry lanes.

Entry 4:

We saw the blows of a humpback or grey mid channel
north of Edmonds
from our place on President Point, Kingston, around 2020. Around 2120 we saw really odd behavior of I assume the same whale heading south but mostly staying on the surface. We saw a couple of small blows and never saw a tail. We lost track of it a little after it passed the refinery. It was eaat of the shipping lanes. -Judy Kimelman
