at least 3 whales with big spouts from Boundary Bay beach
looking due east at 9-10 am this morning. The whales are off Whatcom Co. Not sure what whales? Large, breached right out. Spouts a huge vertical spray so not Greys. Viewing from nearly 10 miles away! Humpbacks or orcas? (updated: Definitely 2 whales, maybe 3 or more. Very distant but two breaching right out. Blow went up strong and vertical. We were viewing with good binoculars but they were far away!) -Anne Murray
