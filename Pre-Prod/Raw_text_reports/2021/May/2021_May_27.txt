Center for Whale Research Encounter #29: "… There were persistent but unconfirmed rumors that T77 had a calf with her on
May 22nd so Dave decided to head out and see if the calf was there. "Orcinus" began leaving Snug Harbor around 1555 and saw a couple boats with the whales near
Kellett Bluff
before even reaching the entrance to the harbor. The encounter began at 1610 after the whales had passed the bluff on Henry Island. The
T65As plus T77 and T77E
were in a tight group heading slowly north. T65A3 and T65A5 were not present. Neither was there a calf with T77. If there had been a calf with T77 on the 22nd that was not T75B4, it was gone now. …" [See CWR Encounter #29 for photos and full summary] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-29

14:40 - 5 Bigg's Transients northbound 2 miles south of Land Bank/Westside Preserve
. The group had 2 youngsters and a large male and traveled somewhat slowly, surfacing low but often. Members identified were the
matriarch T65A (1986), her son T65A2 (2004), her young daughter T65A6 (2018) and traveling tight together T77 (~1981) with her calf T77E (2016).

14:20 - 2-3 orcas northbound
slipped by me. I saw them just as they passed out of view to the north at
Edwards Point

Entry 3:
Oregon Coast (T49C) - ~

09:00 -
I observed one orca on

Entry 4:
Charleston Boat Basin at Coos Bay
. Although I have lived just across the water from Charleston, but this is my first observation and it appeared to be an adult. It swam around the area near the ice plant for a few minutes, with dorsal fin often visible, and it spouted a few times, before departing the area, headed North into where the Coos Bay Bar meets the rest of Coos Bay. I struggled with my phone and spotting scope while attempting to get a picture. I have attached some pictures, which were not as good as I'd hoped. -John Chatt
