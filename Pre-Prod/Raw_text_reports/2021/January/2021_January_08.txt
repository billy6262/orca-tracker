Allie Hudec called. She is down at
Fox Spit
doing some eelgrass work and just saw a
fluke
. Could be a gray, her neighbor saw gray earlier, but she thought looked like a humpback to her, but cannot confirm either way. Whale was mid channel, midway between Fox Spit and the point off Camano Island State Park, and appeared to be heading north. Will let us know if comes back around.
