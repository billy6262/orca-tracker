09:15 - Grey
feeding and travelling this morning off
east side of the island
, first saw them north of Comforts winery, then moved south past Hat and on to the ferry ... didn't get close enough to see markings. Seemed to be feeding a little deeper than they do in the summer; maybe trying to avoid some of the big lumber floating in the shallows? -Sean Nolan
