============================================================

Entry 1:
09:35 -
Allie Hudec called. She received a report from a neighbor of the gray. She reached the beach, saw the
gray off Fox Spit
about 20 minutes ago (~
09:15) then lost it as it moved on in the fog. Apparently, whale was heading inside buoy feeding then off again towards Bells Beach.

08:50 -
Christie Schaefer called to report a
gray whale feeding at Whidbey Shores/Fox Spit
and now heading southbound towards Bells Beach and Langley.

Entry 2:
13:10 -
My wife (Alean) and I saw a beautiful
humpback whale
roughly 15 to 20 yards from the shoreline by
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
on 1/23 at
1:10 pm. He breached once to clear his blow-hole in the little cove to the north of the lighthouse and then three additional times as he casually made his way SSW into Haro Strait. I've lived in Washington for 30 years and this was the first time I've seen a live whale. It was absolutely thrilling!! -Damon J. Gray, Lynden, WA
