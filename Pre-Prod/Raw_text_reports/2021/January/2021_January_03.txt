Center for Whale Research Encounter #1: "… Dave got a good enough shot of the mom to convince him that he had the
T167s. T167A
had sprouted since the last pictures Dave had looked at of him. The T167s have shown up a few times in the last several years (Mark just saw them on
December 31, 2020) although they are not a common group in our area and Dave hadn't had a chance to see them yet. Dave had seen T167 herself several times back in the late 1990s up in Southeast Alaska when she still used to travel with T165 and T166. …" [See CWR Encounter #1 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-1 for full summary and more photos]

First reports on Jan 3 came from
Beckett Point
with reports of a pair heading into
Disco Bay
. We spotted them around
3:15 as they surfaced very close to the east shoreline just north of Tukey Point in the middle of a baitball feeding frenzy by gulls and mergansers. They then moved west across the bay to the Gardiner side. We watched them until dark moving back and forth between Mill Point and Contractor Point. (Approximately the same area where we sighted them again on Jan 6.) -André Wilson
