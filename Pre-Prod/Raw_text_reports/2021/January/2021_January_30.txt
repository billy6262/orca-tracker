-----Orca Food! One of the cooler critter events I've been blessed enough to witness on all my journeys spying on Orcas from land.
Easily 60, maybe as many as 100, Stellar Sea Lions
are hunting Herring in Hale Passage. They would herd the fish under the bridge to the shallows (what initially attracted the Orcas that morning) and feast on the bait ball with all the sea birds helping too. At one point they drifted out mid channel and then started to meander towards Tanglewood and the small shallow bay there. All of a sudden, all the Sea Lions BURST out of the water in unison, I'm talking 60 at once, porpoising with speed and purpose to round the fish up again. Of course, my camera chose this moment to refuse to focus, so this photo does zero justice to what I saw, but it's still pretty cool!! (That is Tanglewood with the Lighthouse. It's a small Island next to
Fox Island
!) -Melissa Bird
*

09:30 - [orcas] northbound in Carr Inlet
(in the middle of Forest Beach). -Jacque Pierson
*

09:12 - The orcas
are still visible from spit at
north end Fox Island trending north
in Carr Inlet in direction of Raft Island. (If they are not in travel mode they may just be drifting while eating their prey -alb)

08:53 -
I saw them 1 male and 2 plus smaller ones. They looked to be headed around
Fox Island
and not towards Raft Island.
----- The sea lions have been hanging around Fox Island for over a week. I thought, I'll take my coffee and my camera and head to the park at the end of my street for a sea lion photo shoot. As I'm crossing the sand spit, I see a big splash and then what I first thought was a sealion with its flipper waving out of the water. Except that it's big....really big...OMG OMG OMG it's an ORCA!! I dropped my coffee and almost choked myself with my camera strap but still managed to get a few pictures. -Stacey Crofoot
