08:33 - Orcas in Penn Cove
this windy morning. Heading west past Monroe Landing. (One large male and at least two smaller ones.) It was my 8-year-old, Jonathan, who spotted them as we drove by. He yelled "Orcas!" Of course, I thought he was looking at driftwood... But there they were! It is always such a thrill. He was very proud...spotting them from a moving car in among the waves! --Geoff Kappes
