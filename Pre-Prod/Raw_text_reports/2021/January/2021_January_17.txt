Orca Sightings for January 17, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Discovery Bay -

16:20 - [humpbacks]
Spotted out by
Gardiner Beach
at
4:20. We and other neighbors have been seeing it consistently for the last two weeks. Two weeks ago there were two, one larger one smaller. But for at least the last 10 days we've only seen the smaller one (presumably the same but not sure). Our sightings over last 10 days have been from the east shore, with the whale very close to west shoreline, generally swimming back and forth between Kalset and Contractor Points but sometimes a bit more north towards Gardiner Beach. -Andr√© Wilson

12:30 - 2 or three humpbacks in Discovery Bay

January 17. First sighted along western shore at
12:30 heading out of bay but then they turned around mid-point and headed back into the bay. They are traveling slowly and feeding. First sighted only one about mid bay
in front of Beckett Point
. Next opposite Beckett Point we saw 2 or 3 blows then rolling with the tail finally coming out of the water. We watched 2 or 3 (we could not tell from how close the blows were) blow then roll - saw dorsal fins and sometimes tail. They continued going out towards Diamond Point but then turned around and headed in again. They were on the opposite shore from me below Gardiner. Headed back towards Contractors Point then we lost them. About
2:00 one surfaced by rolling (did not see any blows) just off Beckett about mid-channel heading out towards Protection Island. We did not see 2 - only one and never saw it again even though we watched for about 20 minutes. No photos as too far away. -Karel Reeves
