06:38 -
This morning at
6:30am I heard whales headed
up (S to N) Colvos Passage
between Vashon Island and the Kitsap Peninsula, near the western (Kitsap) shore. I got my binoculars (I am on eastern shore) and watched them swim, surface, and blow in tandem. I don't know their sex. They didn't appear to be eating because of how fast they were traveling. A motor boat approached up the middle of the passage. I don't think the boat saw them, but the orcas disappeared (to me) as the boat got closer. I observed the pair ~
