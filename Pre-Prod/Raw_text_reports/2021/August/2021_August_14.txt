Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia (T41s, T121As) -

14:30 -
Several orcas headed north very quickly past
Tyee Spit (Campbell River)
. The lovely thing about this sighting was the reaction of the family who was standing nearby us on shore. We pointed out the orcas to the family. They were so very excited. They explained that they were from Ontario and had never seen orcas. What a great day! -Patti and Mark Perepeluk

Entry 3:
19:03 - [orcas]
8/14/21 we were headed east through
Rosario Strait near (just north of) Cypress Island
when they popped up off our port side. We shut off our motor and watched 5-6 orcas hunting and playing. They came right up to the boat and swam underneath us, then continued on westbound. [video: https://www.facebook.com/OrcaNetwork/posts/10165868647835601 ] -Amber Erdmann

We spotted a pair of
orcas at Lummi Rocks
around 4 pm on

, entered Admiralty Inlet today, slowly meandering across the channel from Marrowstone to Lagoon Point and continuing south beyond Bush Point. Onlookers watched, enthralled, as they witnessed an impressive parade of dorsal fins and backlit blows as the various matrilines passed close to shore before slipping away into the hazy light in search of unwary prey. -Sandra Pollard
