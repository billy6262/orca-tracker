Changing direction at

18:15 - L54, L108, L117 and L88 southbound a 1/4 mile from shore, at Edwards Point
. In windy choppy conditions, at first I only saw two orcas but as they passed me the group came closer together and I counted 4. Varied surface behavior included a half-breach and multiple fluke lobs. Matriarch L54 Ino, L108 Coho with a handsome wave along his fin, L117 Keta and L88 Wave Walker.

17:10 - L-pod members traveling southbound
seen on The

----After spending several days up in the Strait of Georgia, the
L54 sub-group of L-Pod
made their way back down Haro Strait this afternoon and evening. This group is made up of just four whales:
L54 Ino, her sons L108 Coho and L117 Keta, and the adult male L88 Wavewalker
who is the last living member of his matriline. Even with just the four of them, the behavioral differences between the two ecotypes are so striking. The L54 sub-group was super surface active all evening, with breaches, tail slaps, spyhops, cartwheels, and dorsal fin slips as they made their way south. They were also very chatty on the hydrophones! Shortly before sunset they all grouped up and made their way quickly back north, perhaps heading back up to the Fraser? Even though it was a super windy afternoon, we no longer take any time we get to spend in the presence of the Southern Residents for granted, and we are so grateful to have spent a few hours with them. -Orca Behavior Institute
*
They were a long way away, but here are three images from this evening at the
Land Bank. L54s. Wave Walker
is the the big male. -James Mead Maya

Entry 4:
T18s, T34s, T37As and T37Bs pass Brighton Beach
, close to shore. I've never seen
so many breaches
one after the other, with the various matrilines interacting in perfect harmony with one another in their pursuit of prey. All photos were taken from just above the beach, zoomed but not cropped, so the full perspective of size comparisons and natural background can be appreciated. The words 'took my breath away' were never more meaningful. -Sandra Pollard

Bruce Bunich called to report orca: "Spotted a big male with huge dorsal, he came right up in front of me yesterday (Aug 30) at 7am off
Norwegian Point
. I was fishing for salmon in waders; my friend down the beach was yelling & waving his arms; he is a quiet guy. I looked, didn't know what he was saying, but was yelling get out of the water, get out of the water. Then next thing you know a big killer whale came up about 20-25 feet in front of me heading
toward Point No Point
from Norwegian Pt. Afterwards, friend said he thought I was a goner, fin was like torpedo headed straight at me. I think he must have been chasing salmon or seal. He came right at me. He submerged just before he got to me then came up by me. I saw his whole body and big old fin. He then went back down, and we didn't see him again. We have been catching a lot, catch-and-release King salmon, while fishing for silvers. That was yesterday morning, 7am. One lone big male. -Bruce Bunich

I took some photos from Tacoma of the
Bigg's Orcas yesterday at Dune Peninsula and Titlow
. I first spotted 3 orcas through my binoculars from Dune Peninsula around
5:45pm yesterday, they were mid channel in East Passage, still pretty far away. I then saw a pod of about 4-6 harbor porpoises around
6:07pm close to shore at Dune Peninsula and they continued around to the Tahlequah ferry lane. At
6:16pm they suddenly appeared very close to shore at the tip of Vashon headed towards the ferry terminal. At
6:19pm It looked like the ferry had to stop in order to let the orcas pass through. The orcas continued past and then hung out near the tip of point defiance for about 15 minutes, two orcas seemed to split off and continue towards the narrows bridge and one orca (possibly male) hung out a little longer near point defiance and I snapped my last photo of him at
6:40pm and then I left to go to Titlow to see if I could catch them there too. We waited a long time to see them at Titlow, they took their time passing through Narrows. I first spotted them from Titlow at
7:26pm and they were hugging the Gig Harbor shoreline. The two smaller orcas seemed to travel closer together with the male bringing up the rear. They would appear and then disappear for some time but eventually continued past Titlow and Fox Island and seemed like they were going up into Carr Inlet. I snapped my last photo at
7:44pm just before the last one disappeared into the distance. Attached are some of the better photos I took yesterday. Thanks! -Sally Milligan-Smith

I can't describe it very well. I almost thought it was a porpoise at first, but it was definitely a small orca. Quite a substantial dorsal fin. I didn't get a good enough look at the saddle. He (aren't most solitaries male?) was heading southeast past
Rolling Ba
y. Not slowly, but not super quick where they hit the air on every stroke. About every 20-40 feet, he came up for a breath. He turned back once, then resumed southbound. Last seen off of
