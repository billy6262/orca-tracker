============================================================

Entry 1:
South Puget Sound (T65As minus T65A5) -

19:19 -
Just past Frye Cove. Headed north.

18:52 - [orcas]
Headed north out of Eld....at Flapjack Point now. -Karen Kt Thomas
*

16:56 -
We are leaving them now, still
westbound at Cooper Point
, but I don't think they have decided on a direction from here yet. They are still pretty playful. See my map [NE of Cooper Point].

16:20 - T65As
just made a kill. Slowly westbound. See my map [SW of
southern tip of Harstine Island
]. Viewing from MV Saratoga, Puget Sound Express. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, PSE
*

20:30 -
They just headed out of
Eld
, heading north. Long dives right before this last surfacing series. Mid channel and angling toward Squaxin Island. All grouped together with all surfacing in unison and then a staggered one. Breaths are like geysers.

19:46- Orca
are currently heading very slowly out of
Eld
. Heading north. They are criss crossing the inlet in dark and brooding skies. Big blows and lots of surface activity. Can hear them a few seconds after their exhales. Magic!

17:36 -
They are still
heading south in Eld Inlet
. They are on the far shore, sometimes all surfacing (and exhaling) at the exact time. It's very choppy but in this one little area, it seems calm. So their fins and backlit blows are obvious. Grace. Gratitude.

17:00 -
They have now crossed across
Budd Inlet
(toward the west) and entered the mouth of Eld Inlet...heading south. They took the western side of Cooper Point. They are on the far shore of Eld Inlet. Super choppy water but can still hear the power of their exhales.

16:20 - Orca
are still heading south out of
Dana Passage - into Budd Inlet
heading toward Boston Harbor and Zangle Cove. VERY surface active in the choppy water. Just saw 4 blows in unison. Bart calls it west. From my vantage point it is south.

16:03 -
Whales are heading south out of
Dana Passage into Budd Inlet
. Just passing the southern tip of Harstine Island and Big Fishtrap on the far shore from me. -Kim Merriman
*

15:35 -
Thursday,
August 5 at
3:35 p.m. a pod of at least
five orca
traveled from Johnson Point and through
Dana Passage headed toward Olympia
. They were very active "spyhopping" and slapping their tailsâ€¦ -Pam & Charlie Rhubart
*

13:37 -
We left them about 10 minutes ago (5 Orcas) as they were heading up the West side of
Key Peninsula
near Devil's Head just outside Drayton's Passage. Saw a kill in the mouth of Drayton's Passage and then they headed north.
---- Yesterday we were motoring (at very safe distance) following three
orcas from outside Oro Bay/Nisqually Reach
west. They stalled outside Drayton Passage. We turned to our starboard, North into the mouth of the passage, when suddenly two additional Orcas surfaced to the right of our bow. So we had 3 to the port side and 2 to starboard. Rather quickly they merged right in front of us (off our port bow at that moment) and started a chase - based on my photographs. I caught several quick snaps of a grab and prey capture. -Christy Jobe
*

16:00 -
Just left them at the southern tip of
Harstine
. Lots of breaching, tail slapping, etc. Lots of directional changes. PSE just showed up.

15:30 -
Still traveling south along

10:02 - [orcas]
Can see from Chambers Bay 2 looks like but not sure heading south not quite to Fox Island east side.
----It was hard to decide, go to Titlow or Chambers Bay yesterday. Anyway, I chose Chambers Bay to view the T65As! It was approximately
10:00am when they approached Fox Island. They stayed on the opposite side the entire time on up through Nisqually Reach. No hunting just straight traveling, but the sound of the blows were phenomenal. -Cherie St.Ours
