Orca Sightings for August 23, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (T2B, T59, T60s) -
We had a picture-perfect afternoon on the water with six Bigg's killer whales, an interesting group made up of f
our of the T60s and the two adult females who are traveling with them, T2B and T59
. -Orca Behavior Institute

18:43 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #56: "After leaving the
T77s
at Battleship (see Encounter 55), the team headed northeast towards a report of another group of Bigg's killer whales, reported as most of the
T60s with T2B and T59
. At
17:15, the team arrived on scene Cowlitz Bay, on the southwest side of
Waldron Island
. The whales were in a resting pattern, logging at the surface for some intervals and then taking long dives with unpredictable headings between surfacing sequences. After the first sequence, the whales split into two groups of two as the rounded Sandy Point and headed northeast. …" [See CWR Encounter #56 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-56 for full summary and more photos]

Center for Whale Research Encounter #55: "… At
14:39, the team arrived on scene just off
San Juan County Park
, with a pair of whales that turned out to be
T77C and T77D
. While the team had photographed these whales recently, they were interested to see how T77C's wound had continued to heal, and to collect behavioral data using drone follows. The two whales made their way up the west side of the island, crossing the mouth of Mitchell Bay and heading into
Open Bay
. There, the team observed them initiate a prey pursuit dive, characterized by both whales turning belly-up before quickly diving. The whales next surfaced close to shore, apparently pursuing a seal, but they did not successfully make a kill. The whales hugged the shoreline tightly as they continued north along Henry Island, still in hunting mode. They tucked close to a pebble beach, and from the drone the team observed them again unsuccessfully pursue a harbor seal, which escaped into the shallows, followed immediately by another unsuccessful pursuit of a nearby river otter. …" [See CWR Encounter # 55 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-55 for full summary and photos]

We are seeing
2 orcas hunting off west side of San Juan Island
, a few miles south of Lime Kiln. -Tori Kidney

14:05-

14:10 -
The pair resumed their travels and headed north past Landbank and out of sight. I suppose this hour of activity could have been hunting for fish or sibling rough-housing. Maybe a little of both. Maybe just happy to be orcas.

13:30-

13:55 -
Trending southward and moving farther from shore to 1/2 mile out, the pair continued their engagement with each other. Circling, bobbing up and down and almost giving chase.

13:14-

13:30 -
The 2 siblings began to circle each other, rising high out of the water and twisting as they re-entered showing their entire saddle path and sometime even a flash of their white belly. Lots of splashing and sideways, upside-down fluke lobs. Circling and circling, up and down in a tight circumference. The water was churning with their activity.

13:05 - 2 Bigg's Transients (T77C and T77D) northbound
just south of
Edwards Point
(south of Landbank). These two snuck right past me. Surfacing to my right the pair stalled as they reached Edwards Point. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
