Elliott Bay

17:20 -
I returned to my spot at
Elliott Bay Marina
in time to see them come out to the west around the Marina. They lined up, a dozen exhalations at times, circled around, directional changes then dove and are now back out of sight around the corner into Elliott Bay back in front of the Marina. Sky is painted in wonderful dark hues, Olympics shaded in pinks and oranges. Sun beams busting through cloud cover...sublime setting.

16:25 - Orcas
have been trending northbound from my earlier updates, but still making directional changes. They continue to move further north, from my vantage not clear if they committed, but looking more likely.

16:05 -
Still stalled out in same general place, drifted a bit south and now back north a little. Making a lot of directional changes and just saw sweet spyhop.

15:33 -
From
Elliott Bay Marina
just watched mini breach fest, dotted with some tail lobs, approx. 3/4-1 mile due south of West Point. Looks like they've stalled, making directional changes. Maybe found some food.

spread out w/many at least well on the mainland side of the channel, others east of mid. All (up to 14 if all still out here) still heading slowly southbound towards West Point, Discovery Park.

Golden Gardens
park.

14:10 - Orcas
have picked up pace... currently south of
Jefferson Head
, out from south end Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. Ts are still traveling steady southbound in at least 3 groups in close proximity to each other. Lead group more mid channel now, others trending that way.

13:55 -
At least most if not all group of 14 off
President Point, Kingston
, and just to the south, well west in channel loosely spread steady slowish southbound (maybe 4 knots). More breaching and tail lobs along the way.

13:34 - Orcas
are loosely grouped slow drift/trend southbound with some surface-active behaviors (breaches, tail lobs, directional changes).
