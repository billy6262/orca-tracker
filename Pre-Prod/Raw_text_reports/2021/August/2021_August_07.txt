NPS/Admiralty Inlet (T65As minus T65A5) -

Lost them shortly after the above report and thought they'd moved on, but looking one last time with the big eyes at
8:30 pm, they popped up just a little bit south of where they were nearly an hour ago, and on another kill! Just SE of Foulweather Bluff, chasing what looked like a sea lion back and forth, lots of tail lobs and porpoising chases and action.

19:45-

19:45 -
Seeing them between us (so. of Bush Pt.) and Foulweather Bluff, watching for about 5 minutes, appear to be hunting or on a kill, but first seen traveling south. [possibly 1st group with T36A2, T36A3, and T137s?] -Susan Berta, Orca Network

They appear to be grouped up and taking a nap, very slowly northbound from my last post as we continue on.

Still drifting very slowly south. About 1/2 mile south of
Marrowstone Island
, in line with the southern tip of the island. It is raining now, so visibility is getting poor.

13:15 - [orcas]
I'm about 2 miles south of Bush Point on the Whidbey Bluff. I can just see them with binoculars about 1 mile
south of Bush Point
very close to Marrowstone Island. They still seem to be going steadily south and are about to be level with the S tip of Marrowstone. Just milling around now. -Mike Meyer

are still sb on
Marrowstone side, opposite Bush Point
