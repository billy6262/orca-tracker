Entry 5:
Port Susan -

12:00 -
Sorry for the delay in reporting, but our crew was on Port Susan on

Entry 6:
four, possibly five transient orcas
, one male, three to four females, two of which appeared very small. They were in the vicinity of 48.1382, -122.3987 noontime. They were relaxed yet appeared as if actively foraging, but it was not a seal hunt. We watched them for at least ten minutes, but then had to go onto our next station further north. It was pretty amazing. I have worked on Port Susan for over 15 years and never seen or heard of them being up that far. And neither have local residents I chat with. -Franchesca Perez, Marine Stewardship and Shellfish Program Biologist, Stillaguamish Tribe
