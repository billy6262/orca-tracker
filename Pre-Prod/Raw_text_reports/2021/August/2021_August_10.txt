Entry 3:
2:20 pm. Seen from … Canal Lane, just south of
Duckabush estuary, Hood Canal
, nearest town Brinnon, WA. They were dispersed but generally heading south. One lingered near the Duckabush estuary (where there is a seal colony). We did not see them returning. I believe at least 1 adult male and 1 smaller juvenile? I have no experience but there are Facebook comments that claim these are the T65[A] group. On the other hand, to me the dorsal fin looks curved. I don't see any open saddle patches but photos don't show this well for most individuals. This is unusual for us! But we have a lot of seals - 4 were huddled on our shore when they were present. -Reid Johnson, Brinnon

14:20 -
Our family was staying in a house this past week along the
Hood Canal
in the Canal Tracts neighborhood (
Brinnon
, WA) and we spotted orcas from the balcony on the other side of the fjord just southeast of us around
2:20pm on Tuesday, the 10th of August. Through our binoculars we saw a breach by an orca with a curved fin. It looked like there were younger orcas with it, possibly 3-4 total, but I cannot confirm that for sure. It was a pretty magical experience…I truly love seeing whales in the wild. -Carolyn ZM

Entry 4:

10:00-

12:00 -
I know it sounds weird, but I think I saw a minke yesterday in
Oakland Bay [Shelton]
. Several surfaces but I wasn't quick enough with the camera to get a picture.
(follow-up: I'm not an expert at all, or even a novice but I'm guessing it was feeding. It was popping up north and south of me for about 2 hours. But I did get one great look at it as it surfaced and saw that it surfaced leading with its nose and barely made any waves. It was at least 20 feet long. It was about
10:00 to noon or so. I left around then so I don't know when it actually left. I've worked down there loading barges for about 10 years and this is a first for me. I've only seen a whale spouting once before and the orcas a couple of years ago. But they didn't get very close. -Bryan Walsworth

Entry 5:

16:40 - We believe a pilot whale went by in Hammersley Inlet
, heading out towards Arcadia Point at the 3.4 to 4 milepost marker on Arcadia. This was at approximately
4:40 pm.
(follow-up: All visible blows (we saw and heard at least 6), surfaced every 2 minutes, went long distance in between, shorter dorsal fin very dark, black. It's behavior and coloring were not that of a gray whale, Dall’s porpoise. It was the size of a Dall’s porpoise though. No pictures, these things happen fast, and it was traveling fast back out towards the mouth of Hammersley Inlet. -Brenda Rix
