Orca Sightings for February 10, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saratoga Passage (T87 and T124A2s) -

12:36 -
Mid channel just south of
Onamac
feeding for past 30 minutes. Eyes on 1 no longer can see two others that were together before. Birds flapping overhead. -Marie Heil
*

16:00 -
I don't know where they
disappeared
- we had eyes north and south, I checked all along northwest
Camano shore and Penn Cove
- nothing. They sure can be stealthy.

12:10 -
Probably on a kill, milling around the north end of
Cama Beach
, non-directional at the moment - mid-channel to Camano side.

12:04 - [orcas] They appear to have turned south, almost back to
Cama Beach SP
- Camano side. -Jill Hein
*
10.59 -
Looks like brunch in
Elger Bay
. Tail slaps. Milling. Birds flocking.

10:32 -
Male and one other orca passing Fox Spit, steady northbound, mid channelish.----Not the clearest images of
T87 and the T124A2s
passing Fox Spit closer to the Camano side, but no matter. We saw whales... They paused in their travels by diverting to Elger Bay for brunch, evident by the slow circling, tail-slaps, splashes and birds hoping for scraps, before continuing north in Saratoga Passage in pursuit of the next adventure (photos Richard Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard

12:38 -
Viewing from High Bank
Hidden Beach
, like Marie says they are on a kill south of Onamac and north of Indian Beach.

10:46 -
Milling in
Elger Bay
area. On a kill.

10:18 - [orcas]
Out from
Bells Beach
, nb. ----We even lost them for a bit when they were in the Elger Bay area. I left after seeing David from high bank Fox Spit and he pointing out they had passed Camano State Park and in line with Cama Beach. I headed to Hidden Beach. From the high bankside there, viewing between trees and brush, I could see them on a kill with bunch of birds taking advantage of scraps. my line of sight was from north Hidden Beach high bank to the southside of Onamac Point. because of limited sighting and feeling they were heading northbound, I headed to Shangri La, no viewpoints in between. I never did see them again either. When they were down, they were down for LOOONG downtimes! -Marilyn Armbruster

I'm at Fox Spit now and

of them yet.

David Haeckel called to report the
orcas are in Saratoga Passage
heading northbound out from around Langley, on Whidbey side to mid channel. -David Haeckel photos - "Great treat seeing these T's today traveling up the Saratoga Passage. Amazing place we live!"
*

8:45 - North of Hat on Whidbey side
. Two spyhops! (definitely northbound, likely to Sandy Point but maybe drifting more east to Camano, little hard to tell.) -Sean Nolan

Entry 3:

09:45 -
my neighbor saw
a puff between Clinton ferry and Hat
heading towards Hat about the time the orcas were reported at Langley (

9:45-ish). I'm guessing that may have been a gray. -Debbie Stewart
