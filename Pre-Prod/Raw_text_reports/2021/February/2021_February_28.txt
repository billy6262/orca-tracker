16:52 -
At least one gray feeding right off shore - deep in the cove at Hidden Beach.
----My first gray whale sighting of the season. I wish the camera could capture how amazing it is. This guy was feeding which is like a delicate dance performed by a 30-ton being. Just a few feet off shore at times. It was magical. -Dori Dace

At least two, maybe
three gray whales west of Baby Island
, slowly moving north towards Saratoga Passage. -Martha Sinclair
