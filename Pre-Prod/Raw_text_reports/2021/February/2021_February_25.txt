Orca Sightings for February 25, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Discovery Bay -
I just recently received these images of
one of the humpbacks that were in Discovery Bay in December and January
. The images were taken by Maria Melito and are screen grabs from her video. -Betsy Carlson, Community (Citizen) Science Coordinator, Port Townsend Marine Science Center

Entry 2:

Milling back and forth out from and near green channel marker
north of Baby Island
and out same distance from end of dock. These [photos] would be the right side of both.

16:45 - 2 grays pretty far out from Baby Island dock
. Milling around. Looooooooooong downtimes.

14:48 -
Marilyn Armbruster texted: From Hidden Beach she was observing two grays traveling together again. From there they were in a difficult area to view,
between Hidden Beach and Greenbank Farm
, possibly out from Surf Paradise Drive at the time, close to Whidbey. -Marilyn Armbruster

Wow! FOUR spyhops off
Hidden Beach
! Pretty sure we have
#53
here [confirmed],
Little Patch
. Now just hanging out Whidbey side of mid channel feeding.

10:50 -
Blows and flukes seen to
west of Polnell Point
so confident there are two whales there although they may not be close together.

10:30 - Grey whale blow and flukes
(there may be two) seen mid channel in upper Saratoga Passage from Hidden Beach. ----More in hope than expectation we headed for Hidden Beach, Whidbey, this morning in anticipation of seeing gray whales - or at least a gray whale. Within five minutes of our arrival, we were amply rewarded by spotting two blows and disappearing flukes in upper Saratoga Passage, north of Hidden Beach, but with visibility decreasing could not determine any direction of travel. An hour later we were privileged to witness a rare sight when regularly returning Sounder #53, Little Patch, spy-hopped not once but FOUR times off Hidden Beach. He was in no hurry to go anywhere and, after taking a cautious look around, remained mid-channel closer to the Whidbey side feeding in the same spot until we left. Although we had also seen a blow from another gray whale a bit further south nearer Whidbey, this whale proved elusive and did not appear again. But what a fantastic start to gray whale season and the arrival of the Sounders. (photos Richard Snowberger/Sandra Pollard) -Sandra Pollard

We had a visitor to our neighborhood cove
(Polnell Point)
this morning (2/25/21)! It wasn't close enough to get any decent identification shots, but it seems to be zig-zagging through the area feeding. -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor
