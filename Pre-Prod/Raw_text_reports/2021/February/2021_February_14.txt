I can confirm these are orcas -- we have sight of them on our camera at the Seattle waterfront. They are moving SB and will likely be
headed to Alki
.

Report of
6-8 orcas near the Seattle waterfront/Edgewater Inn
. Guy who lives above the Edgewater estimates them to be 500' off shore and breaching with lots of surface activity. -Durand Dace

Maija Holston, WSF Marine Ops, emailed at
16:24: Orca whales, today, 1610, Elliott Bay, Â½ mile
off the Edgewater, 3-4 orca
. No direction.

15:15 - T87
present traveling with
T124A2 et al
. T87 thought to be the oldest male on the west coast. At Anchor Park they were at their closest to shore. Probably 50-75 yards. They came in off Magnolia bluffs at
3:15 yesterday, went into
Elliot Bay along grain silos
, then cut over to west Seattle. Cruised south along west Seattle at dusk. at
Alki point
, attempted a predation on an adult male California sea lion, and failed. Moved further south and east in channel. Tightly group and breathing in the grey mist they passed Me Kwa Mooks and then stalled out on another predation attempt that was successful in near dark. -Kersti Muul

Entry 2:
17:30 -
Well, this is quite the crazy year, so why not grays in Feb?! I know
Little Patch [CRC53]
has been hanging out down south, so I'm guessing that's who joined us for Happy Hour close to the beach up here at Mariners Cove. It lingered for several minutes with the typical puffs and swirls, but was slowly moving south and as it got dark and we lost sight of it. So cool! -Marianne Parry
*

13:35 - Little Patch (#53)
heading northbound mid-channel Saratoga Passage, slightly closer to Whidbey, approaching
Harrington Lagoon
area. Possibly 2 whales but can't yet confirm two.
1:35 pm. -Jill Hein
