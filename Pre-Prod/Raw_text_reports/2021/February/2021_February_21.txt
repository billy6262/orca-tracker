Orca Sightings for February 21, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
17:00 -
I spotted a gray mid-channel-ish, maybe a little closer to Whidbey than Camano, straight out from
Mariners Cove
at 5pm today (2/21/21). It was heading south, possibly toward Polnell, and I think it was just one whale. -Marianne Parry

15:34 - 2 grays
(assuming 53 and 56) hanging out again off
Mariners Cove, Whidbey
. -Tyler McKeen
