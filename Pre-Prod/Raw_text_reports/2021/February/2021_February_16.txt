February 16: They're back!
T87 and the T124A2s slipped past Sandy Point mid-morning
after pausing for a snack, attracting the interest of gulls and a pair of watching eagles, before entering Saratoga Passage and continuing north past Langley and beyond. (photos Richard Snowberger/Sandra Pollard). -Sandra Pollard

They are circling and feeding? Off
Sandy Point
. Still there. Lots of spyhopping and seagulls are feeding on the leftovers. A couple bald eagles flew out to see what was going on! There looks to be a small 1 or 2 with them and one of the big ones has a very tall straight fin that flops over to one side a little at the tip. (I watched them for at least an hour from Sandy Point. Lots of spy hopping and tails.)
