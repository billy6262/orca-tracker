Orca Sightings for February 19, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
February 19th,
Southern Resident killer whales were seen heading down the Strait of Georgia
from the shores of Gabriola Island, B.C. Mark received a message from Jane Cogan at 0610 the following morning that she heard faint SRKW calls on her private hydrophone. [See CWR Encounter #9 of Feb 20th encounter] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-9 -Center for Whale Research

Entry 2:
16:45 - 2 grays near Polnell Pt
., a little south and west of there. I'm viewing from high above Long Point but too far for ids...they are traveling towards Crescent Harbor. Very low tide right now. -Marilyn Armbruster

11:54 -
Haven't seen him in about 20 mins. He seemed to be
heading north in Skagit Bay
at last sight.

11:20 - [gray]
Spotted from
Mariners Cove County Park
. Milling around for at least the past 45 mins. He was really far out there. Barely visible to the naked eye. -Victoria Greene

12:30 - A Gray appeared right by the old "Happy Meal Mudflats" just south of Mariners Cove
at about
12:30 (2/19/21), moving south. It must have snuck past right under my nose but at least I caught the tail end (get it - hahah) of its visit. I think it was feeding because it was progressing pretty slowly and I saw a fin here and there, but it was fairly far away so tough to tell. It did not appear to curve in toward Polnell, but I'm not positive. I watched in binoculars once it was out of range of my camera, and one thing I noticed is that it did a huge back-arch move - way higher out of the water and arched than our buddy from last year - so maybe that's something distinctive to help ID.

09:05 -
Looks like a gray is out in the channel
between Mariners Cove and Utsalady, heading north
. What a thrill to see a gray this early in the year! -Also, my neighbor reported hearing a gray at Mariners Cove around
5:30am today. Marianne Parry

Entry 3:
11:00 -
Victoria McKay called to report seeing a gray whale hanging out, north Whidbey. Not sure who, saw 4-5 blows then saw it's back. She is sitting at
Mariners Cove County Park
. Whale is heading in no particular direction, is just moving back and forth making directional changes. She's been there ~20 minutes and had only put eyes on him once. She'll stay a little while longer. Just now while on this call, she saw one more blow.
