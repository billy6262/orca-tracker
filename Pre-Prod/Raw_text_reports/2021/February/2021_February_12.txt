Orca Sightings for February 12, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
17:32 - [orcas] We just saw 4-5, two seem to be juveniles, in Dungeness Bay
. They looked to be feeding about 200-300 yards right off the Lighthouse Keepers quarters. Circled around and spy hopped for about 20 minutes before moving on. -Dale

11:41 -
Looks to be
a pod of transients with a young calf in between Cape George colony and Protection Island
right now, watching them from the road/beach. They looked like they were playing/socializing before a boat approached and they seem to have moved off, could possibly be heading towards North Beach area in Port Townsend, but I'm not exactly sure of which direction they're headed. I watched for about 10 mins. According to my mom who spotted them on her walk and then called me to come out, they were there for 5-10 mins. before I arrived. There were a few breaches and they seemed to be lingering in that one spot before the boat approached heading straight towards them. Couple of spy hops when the boat was approaching but shortly after it arrived, they went under and slowed their surface activity. Looked like 1 adult male, possible juvenile male, and several females/younger whales and possibly a young calf, but I can't be sure as I was observing from land with binoculars. -Mary-Ashley Meideros
