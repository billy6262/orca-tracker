Center for Whale Research Encounter #9: "… Mike 1 continued to slog its way west, tracking the animals as they made their way towards distant flatter water in the lee of Parry Bay between Albert Head and William Head. The next pair of whales that Mark and Joe spotted simultaneously was
L86 and her new calf, L125
! They were racing quickly westward, and L125 appeared to have no trouble keeping up with his/her porpoising mother. The pair joined up with
L55, L90
, and several members of the
L47 matriline just as L72 and L105
also arrived. By this point, both Mark and Joe were fairly confident that only the sub-group of L's that they and Dave had encountered with the J's and K's two days prior (see Encounter #08) were present. Sure enough, reports of J's and K's heading south in San Juan Channel a few minutes later confirmed their suspicion. …" [See CWR Encounter #9 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-9 for full summary and more photos]

Happy World Whale Day to my fellow Dorcas. We were so fortunate to have a visit from
J pod and part of K pod
yesterday. There is always magic in seeing these orcas, and for that moment in time, nothing else matters. They have a beautiful way of bringing people together, and so much of the joy in being with them includes spending time with friends - both human and canine. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

Maybe 30-40 minutes ago…last I had eyes on them from Grandmas Cove, they were several miles off shore, continuing WNW slow and steady travel,
headed back out the Strait of Juan de Fuca

Leaders
approaching Friday Harbor
----After documenting nearly a hundred orca sightings in the Salish Sea so far this year seen by others, to say we were thrilled to finally see some dorsal fins ourselves is an understatement! Fittingly, our first encounter of the year was with Southern Residents as
J-Pod and the K13s made their way down San Juan Channel this morning
. Here's
K20 Spock
, who we objectively claim is just a beautiful whale. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

16:55 -
Just spotted puffs way over by Camano,
south of Utsalady
. It appears to be heading south. Busy whale!

13:30 -
The
gray
that's been cruising around today popped by the Happy Meal Mudflats for a bite at around
1:30pm, coming from the south. It looked like it was going to continue up past Mariners Cove but it turned around right about when it reached our place and slowly worked its way back through the snack bar heading toward
Polnell
.

11:40 -
Wow, the whale(s) is active today! I'm seeing spouting in the direct line between Mariners Cove and what I believe is Maple Grove Beach (
south of Utsalady
), fairly far out in the channel but close to Whidbey. I've been watching it on and off for prob 20-30 minutes now and still can't quite tell if it's going anywhere in particular. It might be slowly meandering south/southwest down Saratoga, but might also be cruising slowly toward the Polnell area. Go Grays!

I was lucky enough to catch sight of a gray heading past my place at
7:30am, so I grabbed my camera and ran outside. It appeared to be feeding at the mudflats, but the tide is pretty high so not a ton of splashing and waving of fins, unlike our summer buddy (2261) from last year. By
7:45, it was moving past the mudflats toward
Polnell
