Orca Sightings for February 27, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
15:15 - A gray popped up at Mariners Cove
a few minutes ago (3pm-ish) and is currently snacking his way through the happy meal mudflats. He appears bound for Polnell, at this point, but not in a big hurry (about 30 minutes since first spot, so he's def lingering!). Love watching them waving fins in the sunlight on the water - so beautiful! -Marianne Parry

Entry 2:
Saratoga Passage/Holmes Harbor
- Today was a remarkable winter day that combined many of my favorite things in one trip - outdoor adventures with my wife, wildlife encounters, photography, and sea kayaking! Very fortunate to encounter
Saratoga [NPS] Gray Whale #53 "Little Patch"
who has been reliably seen in these waters since 1991, the year I graduated from college. -Steve Smith
