Entry 2:
offshore Saturna Island
. -Mark Malleson
*

Entry 3:
Hood Canal -

15:20 - Solitary orca passing under the Hood Canal Bridge southbound
at
3:20 PM. [Follow-up]: So the level of confidence of it being an orca is 100%. You could easily see the dorsal from a mile away, very long. I was thinking that it was two adult orca. The first one I saw was near the east command post of the bridge. The time it took for me to turn around and head on back I saw a dorsal on the west structure near Shine Tidelands [State Park]. I guess it could be a possibility of two adults, however observing for 10 minutes only one was seen heading south without seeing two dorsals at the same time. The intervals appeared to be a single adult. -John Adamson

I live next to the Inn at Spanish Head in
Lincoln City
and saw orcas on Sunday
April 4th between
6:30 and
6:45 pm. I know the exact time because I texted my neighbors who also saw them. I saw
at least 2
, but not a huge group. Maybe 3-4. They were going north. They were pretty far out, but I could see them with the naked eye and confirmed it with a high-powered scope. Since I can see the ocean from inside my house, I am always looking out and can let you know of sightings in the future. -Gail Sammons
