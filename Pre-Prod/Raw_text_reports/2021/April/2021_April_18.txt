The first two pics are from
Dilworth
, that flat glassy water was so lovely and there was this strange haze that hung over the water that looked almost like sea fog, but later determined it was a pollen fog that settled over the water and gave the everything this weird green/yellow hue. Pretty wild! The rest of the pics are from the point. Didn't get a decent pic of him, but
T65A2
was trailing everyone else by himself at quite a distance behind them and was much closer to the mainland side during the pass. Amira though, is looking quite dapper lately with that sprouting dorsal of his, won't be too long before he catches up to his handsome brother. -Marla Smith

I saw it show its entire fluke... The fluke looked like a
