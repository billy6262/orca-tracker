Orca Sightings for April 21, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T90s and T49A3)
- A memorable sail with the T90's and T49A3. Trip recap: The orcas moved
offshore from Lime Kiln
and began a zig zag pattern as if hunting for harbor porpoise which took us close to the border. At the shoals north of Middle Bank a hunt began of a Steller sea lion who was close to a Canadian zodiac. As we watched and photographed the event we were taken by surprise when the sea lion poked his head up at our stern. He circled us and glommed onto the hull. He was very large and our passengers reported that he had bad teeth. We set sails to head for home via Cattle Pt and the sea lion remained under us while the orcas followed behind for the next five miles over an hour and a half of sailing at 3.5 knots.
A little over
a mile from Eagle Cove
the sea lion left the refuge of our boat and headed for shore. The orcas became aware he was awry about ten minutes later. The orcas traveled at speed and caught up with the sea lion resuming their hunt. The approximately
4-yr-old calf, T90D
, was first up charging the sea lion while the other orcas remained on the fringe blocking the escape including to our boat. Little by little others started joining in. The charges were powerful, producing 10-foot waves of spray as the orcas were leaping all around,
knocking the 2,000 lb sea lion into the air
. Thirty minutes later the action diminished and they appeared to be eating. A somber moment as we resumed our sail to Cattle Point. -Captains Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

13:56 -
Saw one big male just approaching
Kingston ferry. Northbound
. West side of channel.
(When looking back thru the pics from the 21st (at Kingston Ferry dock area)... I can actually see what looks like 2+ dorsal fins turned back south about 75 yards behind the male that was visible (right before the
Kingston ferry
area)... while the males continued to go north by me. I would guess that is why that group ended up so far behind the two male brothers. I didn't notice them at all as my focus was on the male at that point & it was so bright out looking out at the water.) -Tisa Annette
[
Sara Hysong-Shimazu ID'd him as
T101A
in your images. The other male then presumably would have been his brother
T101B

Entry 4:
Port Susan/Possession Sound - â€¦ Gray whale #2259
was slow cruising the edge of the [Snohomish] delta, showing enough fluke for an ID before snorkeling into the shallows. Our journey took us to Port Susan, where we found four more gray whales. Sounders #383 and #531 were closely socializing, culminating in BACK TO BACK BREACHES by
#383
!!! It was spectacular, to say the least. Following this excitement, they led us down to the stunning treelined southern coastline of Camano where we met up with #44 and #21. These two males were sticking close to shore, their spouts brilliantly illuminated in the morning sun. The setting could not have been more breathtaking. â€¦Island Adventures Whale Watching
