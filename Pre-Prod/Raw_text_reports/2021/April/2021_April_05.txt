Saw them about 45 minutes ago (

12:30-
12:45 or so). Looks like there was a baby in the mix? Location was on the
west side of Hood Canal along Coyle Peninsula
, just a bit north of the peninsula's south end. (I'm not sure [of direction]. They were stationary for a period. By the time I got down to the beach they were gone.) -Laura Griest

YAY!! They are still in the
Hood Canal
- Monday
April 5th! They were spotted closer to the west side - looking over at
Brinnon
[the Duckabush River]. Southbound. Sighting appears to be around 11am. -Tisa Annette, secondhand from Brinnon Community Group

Entry 4:
~1745-

19:50 - Deception Pass Area
- Received these images from one of our Whale Sighting Network volunteers who photographed this
gray in Rosario just N of Deception
. I defer to Alie to confirm that ID, but looks like a match to the 2nd Rosario whale, the one photographed by Amanda Colbert and Erin Gless on
March 27th off Deception. The gray was swinging around the little island--Northwest Island. -Desiree Sauvé [
"Yes I can confirm that is same individual." -Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective

Entry 7:
12:30 - Gray whale, south east of Hat Island
. Lots of fluke action in deep water.----Taking full advantage of two calm, sunny days and the magnificent Pacific Northwest scenery, we renewed our acquaintance with some of the Sounders, old and new. On
April 5 we spotted a blow south-east of Hat Island, and came upon gray whale
CRC2259
(thanks Alisa Lemire Brooks for ID), a 'newbie' from last year. This whale took a number of deep dives and made a number of directional changes, surprising us more than once. photo - "CRC2259 south-east of Hat Island." -SP, photo -Sandra Pollard

this morning in
Port Susan
spotting from 6am until noon.----Port Susan Whale Watchers have been tracking
4 grays in various locations between Tillicum Beach and Kayak Point
spread out north and south. They were midchannel, 3 came into Pirates Cove for a while, but then Shackleton led the other 2 back towards mid channel. Saw spouts from 1 or 2 other whales mid channel off Tillicum at the same time. So lots of Grays in Port Susan. Lost track a couple minutes ago in the sunrise. -John C. Storbeck
