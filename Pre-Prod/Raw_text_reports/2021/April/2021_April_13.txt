Entry 2:
April 13] at sunset, I saw
a large whale (gray whale?)
Feeding just off shore of
Carroll Point on Hood Canal
. This is about a mile north of Lilliwaup, WA, on Highway 101. I have been on Carroll Point for over 50 years and have never seen a large whale like that in Hood Canal. -Chris Dickinson

Entry 3:
NW Port Susan -

08:25 - 5-6 Minke? whales
just north of Cavalero moving north. Correction - they are
south of Cavalero (across from Thunder Ridge)
moving north. The dorsal fin was small and far back on the body like a Minke. I am certainly just a novice but their size and force of their blow was larger than a porpoise. It was a treat to see them this morning. I hope we get more visits. I was using a spotting scope so the vapors were only visible. They were black and around 30ft in length. There were feeding birds in the vicinity. They were [within] 1-2 body lengths [of each other] and seemed to be interacting. -Amy Noel

John Miller, WSF Marine Ops, emailed to report: TOKITAE - Gray Whale Report 1845hrs: Vessel reports via 800MHz
