============================================================

Entry 1:
~

13:30 - Saw a pod of eight orcas at Davis Bay, Sunshine Coast, BC
, today at about
13:30. One small baby, a cluster of others, and one BIG adult. Traveling eastward. Gorgeous sight. Feeling blessed. -Ruth Ritchey

Entry 2:
14:29 - There's at least one whale (humpback or gray) if not two in Rosario
, south of Lopez heading east/northeast towards James Island. Escorted by one whale watching boat. I'm on shore and can't identify, too far out for my camera. -Morgan Chasson
[
"The whale-watch vessel has reported this as a gray whale." -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI
]

Entry 3:
Gray Whale
scoops, Whidbey Shores - probably from the one I saw couple days ago (I called you then). Looking down from my 200' cliff. I'm. Walking to Baby Island tomorrow, will look for more. -Christi Schaeffer

Entry 4:
14:07 - Viewing from Clinton Ferry Terminal, gray
is in ferry lanes on Muk side, northbound.

13:41 -
Don't know if this is the same whale, but just saw a gray across from
Glendale heading north
.

13:21 -
Correction, heading southeast. I'd say he or she is east of mid channel out from Possession Beach Park,
Mukilteo
side.

13:10 - Single gray whale south of Glendale Beach/Whidbey,
appears to be heading north. I'd guess Whidbey side of mid channel. Viewing from Glendale Beach. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 5:
Port Susan - ~

12:00-

12:30 -
There were
4 gray whales
in Port Susan just south of Kayak Point.
CRC56 and CRC723
were slowly circling together much closer to the Camano shore, and
CRC21 and CRC44
were just a few hundred yards from the mainland side. The two groups were parallel to each other but on opposite sides of the channel. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express
