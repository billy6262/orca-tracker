----We kicked off our 4 1/2 hour trips from Edmonds today with a great double-header. First, we found two pods of
transient killer whales eating a meal about 10 miles south of Edmonds
this morning, and then we headed north to view 3 gray whales in the afternoon. The killer whales were the T123 pod and the T124A2 pod. They were very active during our visit, including a couple of breaches and 5-6 spyhops! The gulls circled overhead as the pods ate their meal for a long time, and then they decided to move on. In travel mode they sent water spray flying as they had to crash through the oncoming waves with each surfacing. Enjoy some pictures from today's action. -Photographer/Naturalist, Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

Entry 6:
minke whales were actively feeding at Eastern Bank
, showing off their speed as they flitted from bait ball to bait ball. We spent a lot of time with these beautiful beings, enough for them to get very comfortable with our presence and come in for some closer passes. Nothing nicer than just drifting with whales. â€¦Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
