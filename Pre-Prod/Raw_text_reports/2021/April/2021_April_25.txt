Center for Whale Research Encounter #23: "… At 1118 they came across a group of five killer whales approaching Secretary Island traveling close to shore on a path
between Possession Point and Secretary Island
(48 20.2/123 43.0). There were two bulls and three cows, and Mark was quickly able to determine that it was the three members of the T101's, although this was his first encounter seeing them since the disappearance of T101's eldest son, T102, who was last seen on
September 17, 2020, and was presumed dead. With Joe Zelwietro's help, Mark confirmed the other two traveling with them were the T100B's, T100B, and her 11-year-old offspring T100B1. …" [See CWR Encounter #23 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-23

Gray whale CRC-1364
was hugging the shoreline of
Bird Rocks
before cutting out into
Rosario Strait

As it continued on towards Burrow's Lighthouse, we continued south with hopes of catching up to some early morning reports of whales in Puget Sound. Along the way we found a slinky minke near Smith Island that was feeding amongst harbor porpoise in glass-calm waters. We got several looks at this rorqual before continuing south… -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
