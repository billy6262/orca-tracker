Have been watching for them from
NE tip of Blake

1:40. (Asked for more info: sounds like the boat saw both and they said they split. One went west and one continued south.) -Rachel Messerschmidt

GRAY WHALES - Sat, Apr 24 - San Juan Islands - …It wasn't long after that some vigilant passengers found us a whale! The heart-shaped spout of
a gray whale
had caught their eye as we passed Swirl Rocks, and sure enough it was none other than
CRC- 1364
. This mature gray wowed us all when it surprised us with a close pass off the port side, sounding and showing off its stunning flukes. We cruised with it past Colville Island and off into
Rosario
before we parted ways… -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
