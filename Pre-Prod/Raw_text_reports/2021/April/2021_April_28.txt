9:09 a.m. today (Wed 4/28/21). They were masked intermittently by ship and boat noise. To date, no other human or machine detections of this event, so no direction can be inferred. Listening to recording, he and I agree these ~2kHz down-sweeps were Bigg's calls. -Scott Veirs, Orcasound

Entry 3:
Hat Island
, we met up with two beautiful gray whales.
Sounder #531
was joined by
another individual
who seemed to be paying her a lot of attention. We got to spend ample time drifting with these two as they circled the waters north of Hat Island. During several instances,
#531
turned directly towards our idle boat only to be intercepted by her companion each time. â€¦Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)

Entry 5:
17:55 - Saw unknown whale, likely orca, off Hastie Lake County Park.
Breaching (back and fin only) once every 5 minutes or so for the last half hr. It's in a different place every time it surfaces. Started from the south close to me, then saw it further west, then came north toward Lopez. Seems like zagging within the vicinity between surfacing. Fairly sure saw a dorsal fin. -Cory Prusha
