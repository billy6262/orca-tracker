…as we neared
East Bank
Captain Carl found us a
couple of minke whales
. It took some time to dial them in, but once we did we realized that we had found a minor whale jackpot. We spent some time down on the shallow banks south of Smith Island and found 3 different minke whales out feeding on this gorgeous afternoon! … -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
