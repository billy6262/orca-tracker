ORCA ALERT tonight near sunset 7ish, my sailboat motor quit running and a small Orca surfaced next to the boat, swam around and under the boat. Seemingly observing us. Within a 1/2 mile, a pod appeared; we were dead in the water. We got cell vid of the little one by the boat. With my camera I got several pics of 1 maybe 2males that were in the pod. Maybe 5-8 whales. Location was middle of
Gardner Bay

Hello! Today I saw a bunch of grays up close while kayaking in
Port Susan
. They kept surprising us by popping up very nearby, when we were floating and watching from a distance. There are 3 different (probably) whales. photo - "Saw this one
north of Kayak Point
in Port Susan at
12:30ish." -Matty Leaman

We had
383 and 531 SE of Hat Island
and Chilkat reports they're still there and spyhopping! -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express
*

09:30 - Gray whale heading south from south end of Port Susan
.----Taking advantage of good tidal and wind conditions, we set out from Langley early to spot gray whales. It wasn't long before we saw two blows against the backdrop of the bluff on the far side of the entrance to Port Susan. After cutting the engine and waiting patiently,
#53
1 suddenly surfaced ahead of us, traveling in a steady trajectory toward Camano Head before turning south. Despite a slow cruise deeper into Port Susan we never came across the second whale, but that's the way it goes sometimes -Sandra Pollard
