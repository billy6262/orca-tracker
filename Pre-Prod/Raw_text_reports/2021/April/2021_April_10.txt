Center for Whale Research Encounter #19: "After Dave and Katie left J pod (Encounter 18-1), they headed across San Juan Channel to try to re-find T77A and T49A2 who had last been seen
near Low Island
. It was a recent sighting but nobody was with them now as it was approaching 1830. We did a search loop around Yellow and McConnell Islands before Katie spotted the two whales off the northwest side of Yellow Island… " [See CWR Encounter #19 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-19

Just as we began to head toward Upright Head we spotted a dorsal fin off the
west side of Decatur island
, and we quickly changed course and headed that way. In no time at all we were on scene with
T77A
and one other
Bigg's orca whales
. The two adult animals we're definitely scouring the shorelines of the surrounding islands for food, spy hopping and circling many of the smaller islands until finally the hunt was on. Being very experienced these two whales made short work of what must have been a harbor porpoise but we could not confirm as it was over pretty quickly. Many sea gulls showed up after that and we even had a bald eagle come in to carry away some scraps. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
