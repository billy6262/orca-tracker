Orca Sightings for April 15, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia (T49As and T49Bs) -
09:00 and

10:00
- These photos were taken on Thursday
April 15, off
Mayne Island on Strait of Georgia
side, early afternoon. Very impassive sight!! Updated: The Thursday
T049As
and Bs were taken at 10am off Mayne island. I had spotted them earlier at 9am in Campbell Bay, crossing from Bennett Bay. So, they seem to have taken an unusual route! The sea lions initially literarily flew above water to run away, and then bunched together in a big group, all raising their heads and barking loudly at the orcas. Orcas moved on but apparently took either seals or sea lions a bit further up the coast before Lighthouse Park. -Yves Tiberghien

San Juan Islands (T90s) - ~

We were on our boat this morning heading west in the Harney Channel near the
mouth of Eastsound
when we saw a blow in the distance around
11:00 am. We stopped and watched 4-5 orcas through binoculars. There was large Orca, 2-3 adults and one juvenile. They moved north to south for about 40 minutes before heading in the direction of Eastsound at around
11:40 am. We were too far away to get any pictures. -Gloria Eppig
