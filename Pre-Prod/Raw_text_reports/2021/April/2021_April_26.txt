14:24-

14:50
- Center for Whale Research Encounter #24: " … At 1424 he spotted a bull dorsal near
Gossip Shoals
amongst a large group of Bonaparte gulls at the
east entrance to Active Pass
. He slowed down as he approached the area where he had seen it and, within a minute or two, spotted a pair of bull killer whales slightly north of him, which turned out to be
T049A1 along with T123A
. They were tight together and coming up in unison on every surfacing. When they dove, Mark scanned around for others as the original report was five animals seen from shore with only one bull. He soon spotted a group of what looked like 5 or 6 females and juveniles a half-mile to the northwest, working their way northwest. He confirmed the rest of the T049A's less T049A2 and T049A3 and the rest of the T123's were in the group of 6.
T049A2 and T049A3 often disperse from the T049As.

13:00-

17:30 -
Watched from
1:00 with spotting scope from Cape George. Very Active! Lots of breeches by all members - at least 5 - tail lobbing, spy hopping. Large male captured what appeared to be sea lion (it was dark brown) half way
between Cannon Point and Cape George
. Dove with it clamped securely in jaws. Down for about 10 seconds and tossed in the air. 4 other orcas in immediate vicinity may have assisted in capture. Lots of "play" close contact, spy hopping, tail lobbing, breeches throughout day. About
5:30 they moved out of
Discovery Bay
toward North Beach and Port Townsend. -Eileen Loerch

12:30-

16:30 - My wife and I observed and photographed the
Biggs orcas spotted off Diamond Point
today from about
12:50 pm until now --
4:30. There appeared to be
6 individuals
including a baby. Lots of enthusiasm. More than 2 dozen complete breeches (recorded about 20 of them), many pec and tail slaps over 2 hours when activity became more leisurely. They were in about 300 feet of water and appear to have been lingering over a kill, which drew numerous seabirds. [Viewing/photos from] our home at the mouth of
Discovery Bay
at Cape George. Extreme telephotos from almost 1.5 miles away. I'm a Wildlife and Fish Biologist, but without specific marine mammal expertise, and my wife is a member of WA's Fish and Wildlife Commission, so a wonderful event for us! -Darrell Smith

---- 4/26/2021 on MV Saratoga was another great day to venture into

…first heard and then saw it at
6:42am and then last saw it at
7:30ish. It was heading around the bend towards Langley around
7:30.
----We saw this off of our cabin deck at Whidbey Shores this morning. So beautiful and breathtaking. I saw what I think was
1-2 gray whales off Whidbey Shores
this morning and it was amazing. Wanted your input on identifying and to let you know that it was there. follow-up: We first heard and then saw it at
6:42am and then last saw it at
7:30ish. It was heading around the bend towards Langley around
7:30. Our cabin is down on Whidbey Shores. This was my first time and it was so amazing and beautiful. So graceful for something so large and listening to it as well was wonderful. Thank you for helping with the identification. -Pamela Sheehan

Entry 7:
11:58 -
There are swarms of harbor porpoises off of
Fay Bainbridge State Park
. Scanning from Shilshole to Jefferson Head, there's not a bit of water without harbor porpoises. Very calm great viewing. Follow-up: I find them impossible to count! When there are small pods they can be elusive, popping up here and there. I could see well to the other shore and from Shilshole to Jeff Head; there were constant visible fins.
Maybe 4-8
at any given time in my binoculars, which is unusual in my limited experience. There were also quite a few in the harbor in front of Port Gamble yesterday, but not like this. -Jim Pasola
