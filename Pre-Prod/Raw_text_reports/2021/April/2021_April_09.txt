Entry 2:
Port Angeles Harbor -
12:30 &

15:00 -
Hello, I work at Downriggers in Port Angeles and we had 2 visitors today. Thought I'd share with you! They came through
the first time at about
12:30 and then again at 3
! It was incredible. I was showing some new diners the video of the whales from earlier and all of a sudden, they popped up again in the same spot! I never would've thought they'd get that close to the buildings! In between the Coho ferry and where we are, we only ever see wood ducks, seals and sea otters occasionally. What an experience!! -Sandra Harringon - videos - https://www.facebook.com/sandra.gearhart.16/posts/6003682449657416 - https://www.facebook.com/sandra.gearhart.16/posts/6004420396250288

Entry 3:
San Juan Islands (T87 and T90s)
- What an amazing day out on the water today. Meliss and I went out on the IE5 out of Anacortes with Tyson and Shane and got to experience an incredible hunt of a Steller [sea lion] just off
Spieden Island
. They seemed to be in teaching mode with the more experienced teaching the younger ones, but that's just a guess. It was exciting and a little hard to watch at times, as that seal did not want to give up. We aren't sure if it got away. If it did, as Tyson Parker Reed said, he'll have a great story to tell the other Stellers. Speaking of Stellers, a group of them went on the offense when the orcas swung by the tip of the island. It was a show of unity and force! The transient
[Bigg's] orcas were T87 and some of the T90s
. -David Haeckel

13:00 -
Update from other post:

, visible from Orcas Island.

12:15 -
12:15 now eastbound in Spieden Channel
.

09:29 -
Another male, as well, further offshore now - 4 or 5 whales total.

09:20 - Milling off County Park. NB
at the moment,
T87
present.
----Based on my photos from County Park these whales are the
T90s with T87 (5 total)
. T87, nicknamed Harbeson, has a distinct notch at the top of his fin and is a regional icon as the oldest living male orca that visits the Salish Sea with an estimated birth year of 1962! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 4:
North Puget Sound (T65As, part of T77s)
-

20:04 - Viewing from Redondo. They have passed
Pt Robinson
moving swiftly.

19:51 - Orcas approaching KVI towers
. Heading southbound, Vashon side of channel. -Steve Brown
*

17:19 -
Just saw a lone Orca off the
North East tip of Blake Island
about 10 minutes ago. It didn't seem to be moving very quickly, it was facing southbound. Came up for 3 or 4 breathes in about the same spot, then didn't come up again that I saw. -Brenden Messerschmidt
*
Had to crop a ton, and they were hard to see from Picnic Point, but I definitely saw some surface action and it's awesome to think they were taking down a minke! -Danielle Carter
*

13:36 - [orcas]
West of
Richmond Beach
. Just east of shipping lane. S bound, coming up on yellow buoy. -North Allen Aspelund
*

13:50 -
They were steady southbound clearing north end
Richmond Beach/Jefferson Head
east side of channel. I moved and haven't found them again.

13:36 -
Pod is loosely grouped just at yellow mid channel buoy
off Richmond
on east side of channel. Steady southbound in whitecap seas. Earlier some antics and directional changes by little one.

13:03 -
Eyes on pod, east of mid channel out from
Point Wells
, Woodway, steady southbound approaching
Richmond Beach
, grouped tight. Beautiful. -Seas rough, wind has a bite. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

12:23 -
Donna Sanders, WSF Marine Ops, emailed to report Walla Walla
pod of Orca
unknown count within the EDM>KING SB traffic lane
[Edmonds to Kingston
southbound lanes].
*

12:12 - [orcas]
They are south of
Stamm Overlook
, heading south. -Shelby Phelps
*

13:27 -
We think it's likely that they
may have killed a minke whale
today. Here is a screen shot from my computer of them punting scraps in the air over and over again. They fed there for a very long time and the oil slick on the surface was huge. Skin looks like minke whale color, and there were two spotted at Camano Head yesterday. (
south of Possession Point
)

12:15 - T65As, T77

11:30 -
Still milling, eating a big meal. [map shows midway between Edmonds and Possession Point -gs]
----The day started out with lots of promise when Captain Trevor spotted
transient killer whales circling around at Possession Point
about an hour before our trip even started. Once underway we found the
T65A pod, and part of the T77 pod
within 5 minutes and noticed they hadn't moved at all since Trevor's first spotting. It was obvious, by all the birds circling above them they were eating a meal. They continued to eat their meal for our entire visit and towards the end a few of the orcas started punting large pieces of their prey 20-30 feet into the air! Killer whales punt stuff by turning upside down and swiping their tail flukes at their target. This is a tactic they often use to stun and injure their prey while it's still alive, but they are also known to do this as a potential form of sport. There were plenty of "swing and a miss" moments, but the black and whites also hit their target on a handful of occasions, sending the skin/blubber flying high. At that point we started to speculate what the prey might have been and the evidence pointed towards a very large animal such as a small minke whale or an elephant seal. The tremendous size of the oil slick on the surface of the water was one clue, as it was much larger than normal. The color of the skin on the prey remnants they were kicking into the air did not match harbor seal, Steller sea lion, California sea lion, or harbor porpoise (their most common prey items). The best color matches seemed to be for a minke whale or an elephant seal. Elephant seals are rare but we definitely see them in that area of Puget Sound from time to time. Minke whales are also rare in that area, but two of them were spotted nearby just the day before. Perhaps we will never know what they did kill on that day but it's always fun to speculate and lean on past experiences to try and come up with an answer. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

Entry 7:
Rich Passage/Central Puget Sound -

07:18 -
This morning, Friday
April 9th. Large gray or humpback whale went by our house in Rich Passage, fairly close to shore. Heading east towards Fort Ward Park and the main shipping lanes. Edit w/added description: It was super
big, no dorsal fin, and had white/barnacles on its back
. Sorry... no pictures. It would blow on the surface and just barely go under, then come back up again 20 yards farther away. -Shannon Mcorr

Entry 9:
~

13:30 -
This afternoon around
1:30 I caught these photos off of
Camano Island State Park
. I thought they might be harbor porpoises but they seemed too big and now I
think they were Minke Whales
. Any experts want to weigh in? -Pamela Troeppl Kinnaird [CWW]

"This is fantastic documentation, thank you! While minkes are seen around the Salish Sea, that's a rather unusual spot for them and I've personally never encountered one in Saratoga Passage!" -Erin Johns Gless, Marine Biologist/Naturalist
