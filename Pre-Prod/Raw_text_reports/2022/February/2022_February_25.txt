Entry 3:
Possession Sound -

12:51 -
I had to take one more look from
Legion Park in Everett
. There are definitely
2 grays feeding off of Priest Point
right now.

10:45 -
Ok, there's one in
between Tulalip and Hat Island
, heading north, that I'm nearly 100% sure is a gray. It's possible there's another one that I quickly saw through binoculars and looked to be quite a bit closer, heading southwest towards
Clinton/Mukilteo
, but I haven't seen it again, so it's hard to confirm.

10:15 -
Popped up again. Roughly the same place, but seem to generally be heading west. [
gray whale confirmed from distant back-of-camera image by Sara
] I'm not fully convinced there aren't multiples out here, though. There was another one that popped up a little closer.

10:00 -
Just spotted a few blows and then a tail (viewing from the side at Harborview [Park], so couldn't tell ID based on that) in between Priest Point and Hat Island heading southwest. -Sara Montour Lewis

Entry 4:
Port Susan to Possession Sound -
08:00
Judy and Tom Nowak called to report seeing
2 large whales
, they are reporting as sperm whales knowing how improbable that sounds. The Nowaks are familiar with grays and all other large whales, and know the grays are here but state with confidence they are not gray whales. Described as ~60 feet in length, uniformly gray, and exhalations extend to the right. They've seen at least 20 blows as the whales moved from Port Susan to now Port Gardner Bay, Everett, keeping to deeper water as they appear to be heading toward the Mukilteo/Clinton area. We did make him aware that there are at least 4 grays here and are seen daily, feeding or passing through in those very areas, but they are confident they were not grays.
