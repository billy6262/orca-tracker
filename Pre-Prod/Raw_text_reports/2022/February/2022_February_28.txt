Entry 3:
N Saratoga Passage -

10:30 -
I was lucky and happened to look out over the water as a gray was passing by
Mariners Cove
- looks like a repositioning cruise because I only saw two puffs and then nothing, so I'm not sure which direction it went. It was closer to Whidbey than Camano, not terribly far out. -Marianne Parry
