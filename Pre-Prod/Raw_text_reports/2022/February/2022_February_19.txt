one Gray
still feeding in same area as

one Gray off Jetty Island

: out from Naval base; one a couple hundred yards off the very south end of Jetty Island (off rock jetty) and 2nd whale ~1/4 mile west of them. Fins swirling in shallows and deeper shallows. Likely same two unless more out here.

This whale has traveled a bit west, but still in same general area.

Entry 5:
15:50 - [gray]
We were just watching a whale or two from
Mariner Cove County Park
. Probably 200 yards off shore. -Nick Sue
*
The same gray as earlier this morning [in photo] came by for a quick snack at the
Happy Meal Mudflats/Mariners Cove
, but moved on pretty fast (10 min). I saw that distinctive white diagonal line in the binoculars so I'm sure it was the same whale as before.
