08:30 - Southern Residents this morning in Boundary Pass

18:50 -
One of the
grays
came back (presumably from
Polnell
) right before sunset and was feeding at the happy meal mudflats around
6:50pm, so there are some orange-y photos in the bunch from that visit.

16:30 -
As of
4:30pm, the one that was consistently feeding was out in the happy meal mudflats but not super close to shore, heading down the beach into the sunset, and the other one was just a little further out, weaving back and forth and not quite sure about this feeding business.

15:50 -
Heard a puff in the distance and finally spotted the gray way out in the channel
between Mariners Cove and Utsalady
. It's staying under a long time between spouts. As I watched, I now think there are two of them, unless the one is lightning fast underwater. Not positive though.
----OK, so this was a treat! As I was watching the spouts out in the channel trying to figure out if it was one or two grays out there, one of them popped up with a huuuuge blow literally right in front of me (I was sitting on the beach). -The second one came in toward the beach as well and they met up right in front of
Mariners' Cove
- very exciting to watch! ... But very frustrating to try to photograph - whack-a-mole with the camera. Quite a bit of feeding going on, although one of them was more skittish and would head back into the channel a bit and then back to the beach (this is also the "stick my head up and look around" guy). The other one was consistently feeding and working its way southward down the beach. -Marianne Parry
[
your sunset whale is
53 Little Patch
, and the earlier two I am pretty sure is him on the left and for sure
56
on the right. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
