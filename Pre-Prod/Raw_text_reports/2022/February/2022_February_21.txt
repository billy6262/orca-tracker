Orca Sightings for February 21, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands - Js were just outside of Eastsound
slightly to the west of the entrance moving east. -Dawn Fujino Redmond
*
There was a
12-noon report of possible orcas in Eastsound [Orcas Island]
, so that must have been
Js
! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*

Entry 2:
Boundary Pass -

10:00 -
Good morning. We have
a pod of Orca heading to the east side of Stuart in Boundary Pass
. They came south through Plumper Sound. Sorry, in the chop hard to count, but
between 5 to 8
. Baby in the group and very large male. Male has wavy dorsal. -Kath Durant

Entry 3:
14:50 - [gray] Going back and forth off Mariners' Cove jetty
- I think only one gray. -Paul E. Belanger
*

14:04 -
Based on location of last blow, the whale I saw appears to be trending towards
Mariners Cove
.

13:42 -
I'm at
Maple Grove on Camano
and see a blow straight across, 1/2 way
between Polnell Pt. and Mariners Cove
. Too far for pic or direction. -Krista Paulino
*

13:19 -
Second whale identified,
#56 is currently heading into Crescent Harbor
.

13:04 - Gray whale #53 is the whale hanging around Rocky Point
. Getting on scene with second gray now heading toward Crescent Harbor. -Tyson Parker Reed, Naturalist, Island Adventures
*

14:48 -
More follow-up info - I've been staring out here trying to figure out if it's one or two grays. There is one here (still looks like just one) but I spotted a spout waaaaay in the distance between here and the point
south of Maple Grove on Camano
.

14:37 -
I may have mis-spoken - I could swear I saw two grays out there initially, but I think I'm
only seeing one now
. Unless they're really good at taking turns spouting. At least one gray is passing the Mariners Cove marina area heading north now, but still fairly far away from shore.

13:45 -
Two grays popped up frolicking mid-channel just out from southern tip of Mariners Cove.

10:35 -
I can confirm
two grays out in the channel
, spouting simultaneously right next to each other. They're near the
south end of Mariners Cove
, but not close enough to get photos. I can't really tell where they're heading - maybe south/west, but if it's 53/56 then they are apparently fond of taking the scenic route so hard to know.

10:00 -
Just looked up from my laptop and was lucky enough to catch a huge puff out in the channel (10am). I think it was heading north/east,
approaching Utsalady from the south
, but I haven't seen a subsequent puff so I'm not positive. -Marianne Parry

Entry 4:
Possession Sound -

11:26 -
Alice Moyal reports seeing
2 grays close in mid-way up northside Hat Island
. Partial breach then another breach! Then the two grays went on their way, appeared to be heading eastbound toward Everett.
