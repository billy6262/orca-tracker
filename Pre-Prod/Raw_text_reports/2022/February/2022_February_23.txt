Entry 1:
a gray whale passing by Ebey's Landing
when I was out for a walk at sunset tonight. So close to the shoreline! -Karen Bishop

Entry 2:
N Saratoga Passage/Skagit Bay -

11:00 -
There's
a gray (and prob two) spouting way out in the channel out from Mariners Cove
, and it's working its way southward just in line with Maple Grove beach now. It's too far away to be positive, but the frequency, location, and direction of the puffs makes me think there could be two.

09:45 - Gray in Skagit Bay
. Good morning! I just spotted puffs waaaaay out in Skagit Bay - so far away (to the north) that I can barely see them - but I think maybe it/they are heading this way (toward Mariners Cove). Might be wishful thinking. photo -
15:45: "The tide was out a few minutes ago so I snapped this photo of the
whale pits
at the northern end of the Happy Meal Mudflats." -Marianne Parry

Saw this
gray at Pebble Beach
