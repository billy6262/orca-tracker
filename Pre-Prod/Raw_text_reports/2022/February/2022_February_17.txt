Orca Sightings for February 17, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gulf Islands -
10:50 hr.
first sighted: At first travelling fast northward through Sansum Narrows, BC (my location: Stoney Hill, Outside Maple Bay, BC). Exiting the Narrows, they crossed NW to near Grave Point and appeared to be feeding in that area for about 15 min. I am certain there were
at least 4
(3 surfaced at once with another surfacing shortly after but too far away to have been in the trio), but I suspect there were more animals. Observed one incidence of spy hopping. They were far from me (1-2 km). -Karen Lund
