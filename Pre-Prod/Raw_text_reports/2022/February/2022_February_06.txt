Orca Sightings for February 6, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
NRKWs (A42s) -

16:00 -
Just reporting a sighting of
a pod of Transient Orcas [NRKWs] seen around Grebe Islets moving south towards Lighthouse Park in West Vancouver
. There were approximately 10-12 animals. [Confirmed A42's (Northern Residents)" -Rachelle Hayden on Howe Sound FB group page] -Mike Klotz
Follow-up: It could have been 6-7 as there were 5 smaller whales breaching together and two larger at the front for sure. The breaching was sporadic after that with different groups. -Mike Klotz

Entry 2:
NW Strait of Georgia -
There were a few whales together on this day. Several sea lions were in a group fairly close to shore. There were others that were further out of course and I saw the whales take a sea lion. But, on
February 6 I also saw the whales in a resting line. Several of them rested for about five minutes and at least one whale continued to rest for nine minutes. Light was fading and I thought about packing up my gear. My inner voice said, "just one more minute" and I was happy I did not put my camera away as one of the whales breached twice. The whales were in no hurry to move on. When nightfall came, I remained there on shore just to take it all in and to just listen to the sound of the whales breathing! -Patti Perepeluk

Killer Whale (Orca) Sighting: Number Sighted: 5
. ON follow up: They were heading towards Nanaimo (north). I tried to get a shot but they went around the corner. That was the second time I saw them yesterday. First time had to use the telescope they were about the third of the way between us and Vancouver. sApparently, the herring was running, there was quite a few boats in the area. Yes, that is correct. We are on
Gabriola Island
. Our view is almost 180 degrees from Sechelt to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal. Our 12 o'clock is UBC and downtown Vancouver. -Patrick Mulvaney
