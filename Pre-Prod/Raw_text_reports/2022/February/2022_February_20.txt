Orca Sightings for February 20, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound to E Strait of Juan de Fuca -
Think we saw these same ones [orcas] off of
West Beach [NW Whidbey Island/Oak Harbor]
at sunset. They were really far offshore, too far for pics. There were also a couple of baleen whales about halfway between shore and the Orca. -Melanie Holbrook

12:00 -
Had a wonderful siting of
4 orca (one of which a large male)
east and then northbound close in on the
SE shore of Marrowstone Island
at noon on the 20th. This being the month's anniversary of my husband's death, seeing these magnificent animals where we've never seen them before (They are usually much farther east.) opens my heart and gives me hope. -Janet Welch
