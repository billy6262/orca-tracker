Orca Sightings for February 15, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (Js)

18:40 -
Sounds like maybe they ended up going south. The last blows I could hear were south from RT.

18:15 - Passing Reuben Tarte northbound
in the moonlight.

16:55 - [orcas]
Got a visual from
Reuben Tarte
of blows
west of Yellow Island in San Juan Channel
- too far to determine direction.
---- After spending a few days up in the Strait of Georgia, J-Pod made an appearance in the San Juan Islands today. They remained out of our view until close to sunset, when we saw them heading back into San Juan Channel in a large, slow-moving group. We thought that distant look would be all that was in store for us, but then as the light was fading, the whales made a turn towards us on shore at
Reuben Tarte County Park
. Seemingly waking up, they picked up speed and started becoming very surface active with breaches and tail slaps. As dusk fell, their blows became audible. Through binoculars, we could somehow still glimpse them in the near-darkness, and it looked like they were going south. But suddenly the blows became louder. The clouds parted, revealing the nearly full moon, and in a bucket-list moment, several dorsal fins were visible in the moonlight, heading north. (Despite how bright it looks in Jason's video, that's the moon track at the end of this video clip!)

14:50 - [J pod]
At @
2:50pm I saw a
pod of 5
cross westbound within the interisland ferry as it was about to
head to Shaw at the Orcas dock
. They came within 20 feet and seemed to have at least one baby hanging close. What a gift! This passby included two spy hops which I have never seen before with my previous dozen or so sightings mostly from when I lived at Three Tree Point. I was hoping it was the Southern Residents and sounds like it was. -Carole Blakey

Entry 2:
N Saratoga Passage -

20:25 -
A neighbor alerted me to a gray puffing out in the dark tonight, so we hustled outside to take a listen. It was dark so no visuals, but I could hear puffs at the Happy Meal Mudflats (just south of
Mariners Cove
). Based on the frequency, I'm guessing that it was just one whale. It was too cold to stay out for long so I don't know how long it stuck around, but I hope it had a good nighttime snack. Also, I noted that the tide was only around 1.5'. Hearing a whale breathing so close by in the darkness is just.so.cool. -Marianne Parry
