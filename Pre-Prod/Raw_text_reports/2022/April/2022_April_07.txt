Looks like 1 male. ----Wow, incredible day watching them Chambers Bay to Anderson/Ketron and back again! The one male made a very close pass near Sunnyside Beach in Steilacoom and then met the others in between McNeil and Fox Island. Pretty sure that’s where they did a kill and celebrated and then one, I believe, the male slept! He just laid motionless on top of the water for quite sometime. Something I have not seen before with Orca but with Harbor Porpoises. -Cherie St.Ours * 11:12 - Just passed by Pitt Passage heading south on McNeil side. 2 of them? One very large male.

I can’t tell what type of whales they are since I’m pretty far away, but there are a bunch of boats huddled in that area watching them. I know I’m not being super helpful, but maybe someone can give you guys more info. I don’t think they were orcas because their dorsal fins appeared small. Just milling around. -Ashley Hironimus * Thu, Apr 7 - South Puget Sound - 17:21 - A lone whale just passed Treble Point (Anderson Island), moving quickly heading south. It was definitely NOT an orca, but I’m not sure what it was. Minke? Not a gray whale. It definitely had a dorsal fin.

We made our way north from there and found CRC531 fluking around near Tulalip. Last but certainly not least, southbound off the NE side of Hat Island was a cuddle puddle of 4 gray whales! This social group was made up of CRC21 "Shackleton", CRC22 "Earhart", CRC383, and CRC2362!

No ID yet. ----We cruised out to Hat Island and found gray whale 531 cruising around the shallows and showing off her flukes a few times.

He showed off his large patch a few times but as usual was hesitant to show his flukes.

[N of Trinidad, CA] In Sue-meg State Park (41.3198 -124.1620), we watched through binoculars three Oo [Orcinus orca] swimming north about 0.5 nmi from shore. There was a tall but not fully adult male, a medium falcate likely female and a smaller one, stocky with a squat angular dorsal fin shorter than seemed right for body length. They were dispersed, paused to mill off the reefs, along surface slicks, then increased speed once past Patrick's Point. I kept scanning offshore for other subgroups, didn't see any, in part due to light haze. By around 1715 we lost sight of the trio. At 1813 I got a text from commercial fisherman Marc Schmidt (an avid wildlife biologist who instantly notifies me of Oo et al.) who was passing Big Lagoon (at 41.1981 -124.2119, 200' depth), about 4 nmi NW of our shore observation reporting 8-10 Oo including one big male "near some good salmon sign and I saw a couple salmon... heading north but then milling around that bait spot", "...some of them looked nearly a mile apart".
