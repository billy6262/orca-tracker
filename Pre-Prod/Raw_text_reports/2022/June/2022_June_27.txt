Kim Page called to report of the group or
orcas making their way up Puget Sound
. They are now mid way
between Eglon and Pilot Point
, close in on the Kitsap side. They slowed up on their northbound travels and had been circling for a while and looked to be feeding. Kim is looking into the sun, so hard to get total on numbers, but there are at least 2 males and 3-4 females. (sounds probable for 65As at least).

MINKE WHALES -
Mon, Jun 27 - A last minute decision to go to San Juan Island yesterday (Monday), but shore-based whale watching was not an option so we took a trip out to see
3 minke whales
, lunge feeding,
south of Cattle Point
. What a treat. -Jill Hein, Orca Network

Stubbs

Entry 16:

We managed to get on board Odyssey and found a great group
(3-4) of lunge feeding minke whales
south of Cattle Point
. With the birds helping out in congregating where the whale would probably come up, I managed to capture some great looks at a face of a minke whale! This was probably one of my best minke encounters, as they're known for being very sneaky! -Bonnie Gretz
