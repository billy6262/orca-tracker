09:24 -
Amy Wheeler called again after returning from walk to report
Orcas in Admiralty Inlet
. She and her wife were walking on
Maxwelton Beach
, Whidbey when they spotted first one fin, but then next
two orcas
surfaced together heading
southbound
. Orcas were coming from Double Bluff area, mid channel, but were trending more towards Kitsap side as they continued south. They were viewing without binoculars, and could see the orcas well, so think possibly two males.

1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve, two humpbacks
side by side, very slowly, very stately southbound, less than 1/4 mile off shore. One of the humpbacks was
BCZ0298 "Split Fin"
. About 100 yds south of me, they changed direction passing in front of me again to the north. The sun wasn't on the water yet, just striking the tips of the dorsal fins and their shapes were just beautiful cutting through the dark surface. Photographed from shore, cropped and enlarged. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
