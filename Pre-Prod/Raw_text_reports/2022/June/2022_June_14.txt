UNIDENTIFIED BALEEN WHALES -

Entry 5:
Possible juvenile humpback
alone off
Port Townsend
. I would like to report this, even if I am unsure of what I am reporting, because if indeed there is a juvenile humpback in distress off Port Townsend, I would be one of several voices that would help confirm the event. Rick and I bought a coffee at the espresso shop and walked down to the water and sat on the seawall shortly before 5 o’clock today. I watched a small (25’?) whale, which I believe was definitely a whale because of the way it was swimming out in the water at about 75 yards. The sun was out and I distinctly, repeatedly saw the dorsal fin as being the same profile that I can only identify in a humpback whale. This animal would flounder a little at the surface exposing the dorsal fin and then pop its head up just for a brief second (as if it was peeking above water), and then continue to very slowly swim at that distance parallel to the shore. -Judy Eidge
