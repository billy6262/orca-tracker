Saw this
humpback
on Wed.
June 15th, 4-6pm, while paddleboarding in
Case Inlet south of Herron Island
. Was initially moving south, closer to Key Peninsula side, surfacing for 3-4 breaths and then diving for about 3 minutes, never showing its fluke. Eventually crossed the inlet toward
Harstine Island
, south of Fudge Point and breached 4-5 times mid-channel; spectacular full-body breaches! Then moved back north to the south-west end of Herron and crossed toward Harstine north of McMicken Island, at which point I lost it. Sorry, no pictures, just memories. -Dave Berliner
