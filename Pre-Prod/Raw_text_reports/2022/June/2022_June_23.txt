Day report: 6-23-22,
J-Pod, Haro Strait -

08:27 -

09:26 - A line of J-Pod members
traveling in a closely spaced line southbound past
Point Edwards
, just south of Landbank Westside Preserve. They were traveling tight, not rising much out of the water. Slowly the line of orcas crossed in front of me. Surface vocalizations were heard. I got into the car to follow them to a private beach near Pile Point and when I arrived at
08:53, they had just begun a turn back to the north. I hurried back to my previous spot where I found
J-Pod
milling, 1 mile
south of Landbank
. At
09:10 they turned back towards the south and again I heard surface vocalizations. I drove back to the private beach to watch them pass Pile Point heading south at
09:26.

12:02 -

12:09 - J-Pod northbound 1 mile south of Landbank.
J-Pod returned from the south, some in a close line again and others separately or in small groups.

All of J Pod
in one group off
Lime Kiln northbound
.

8:30 - L25 and L85
going north just north of
False Bay
-Monika Wieland Shields, OBI [WSSJI]
Fifteen years ago, the L12s were a classic westside shuffle group, spending a good portion of the summer plying the waters between Salmon Bank and Lime Kiln. More recently, they've become even more infrequent visitors than the rest of the Southern Residents, becoming one of the most rarely encountered groups in inland waters. It was thus an extra special surprise to see
L25 and her sub-group
show up earlier this week
with J-Pod

Entry 15:
Sent via form submission from Orca Network
Name: Remi Haeri
Date of Sighting: 6/23/2022
Time:

9:15
AM
Species seen:
Minke with calf
Number of animals seen:
2
Where seen: Seen NE off of
Marrowstone Island
Direction of travel : NW towards Port Townsend, not moving very fast
Behaviors observed: The baby seemed playful, they looked relaxed, like they were leisurely traveling
If orcas, any males?:
Any unusual markings?:
Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: The baby seemed playful, breaching once and throwing their flipper out of the water
FOLLOW UP: I looked at the chart to be sure, but I’m pretty positive they were minke. The size and coloring would be hard to be sure of as the sun was causing some glare on the water. They seemed pretty small for a whale though and they weren’t black. The tails also looked very similar to pictures I looked up. I had a hard time identifying them at first, since I’d never seen whales that looked like that before. It’s possible I’m wrong, but it was definitely not an orca, gray, humpback or a porpoise. The dorsal fins looked like the dorsal fin on the minke whales on the chart. Hope that helps! Remi
