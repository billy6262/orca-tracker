approaching Landbank's Westside Preserve. They passed quickly, some as close as 300 yards from shore.

18:22 - J-Pod southbound after passing Point Edwards
. As they neared my vantage point I suddenly could hear blows close-in to the south and L-Pod appeared traveling north to meet up with J-Pod. An amazing greeting ceremony commenced with breaching, fluke lobs and rolling with each other in small groups. The activity wasn't frantic but slow and graceful, swirling in all directions. After the greeting, they all headed south.

Entry 6:
~

10:30-11 -
Kevin Stephenson called on the 28th to report a whale he saw on Friday,
June 24th around

10:30-11 am in the
north end Agate pass
about 1 mile
south of Suquamish dock
. The whale was heading northbound (as he was transiting southbound in his boat). He is on his boat year-round, familiar with and sees all species of whales and this was like no one he’s ever seen. He
thinks it was a beluga
. Whale was 12-15 feet long, had a bulbous head, was tawny to white in color. Whale surfaced several times and continued northbound. Tried for a photo but by time got it out whale north and he had to keep focus on getting himself safely through the narrow passage. (
reported as beluga, but not photos to confirm -alb
)

HUMPBACK WHALES -

GRAY WHALES -

Entry 8:
Oak Harbor -

20:14 - Marlyna Stewart called to report
a gray whale in the Oak Harbor area
[approx. 48.26758 , -122.65361]. They have been watching the whale
since about

7:30-
7:45
. When they first saw the gray she was in the middle of the entrance to the harbor (Oak Harbor) heading out toward open water. When she circled back she was on the other side of the entrance to Oak Harbor on the Maylor Point side, feeding super close in maybe 10-20 feet, moving back and forth feeding about the length of a football field. Whale was coming back towards the harbor at the time of the call. Beautiful to watch, rounding up the shrimp by spinning onto her side, exposing her fin and part of her fluke above surface as she was gliding along the mud then spinning back up. Her blows ~ 4-5 feet tall. Whale was going to town having quite a feast for about an hour. Really cool sight to behold right here near the marina in shallow waters.
