J-Pod, Haro Strait, SJI -

11:55 -

12:45 -
J-Pod southbound at
Point Edwards
. Spread out and traveling quickly, the orcas were 1/3 to 2 miles from shore. With heat distortion over the water, photography was suspended unless they were close in. There was some porpoising from one member but it didn't last long and there were 3-4 breaches to the south. The trailing members were
J37 Hy'Shqa and her daughter J59. Surfacing often the pair moved quickly accompanied in the distance by SoundWatch, J59
tight to her mother's side. Both SoundWatch and StraitWatch were present on the west side and did a great job of stopping the recreational boats and sending them out to the west to circle around J-Pod!

12:59 - There's still a lone male 2 miles out, southbound.

14:00 -

15:50 - Splashes to the south near Pile Point. I could see 2 orcas including a large male and they were trending north. The orcas moved to the north and south within the general area. Sometimes I could see them and other times I couldn't. -Michelline Halliday

Entry 4:
Admiralty Inlet (T65As, T77, T77E) -

16:05 -
The T65As and T77 with T77E are still
southbound at Point No Point
mid channel. -Justine Buckmaster, PSE
*

14:40 - The orcas have passed close to Bush Point boat ramp at a steady pace southbound
.
Timing is of the essence with whale watching, and today was no exception.
Bush Point boat ramp
was the place to be as the intrepid
T65As
together with the
T77s
advanced with a dash of panache from
Lagoon Point
along the Whidbey shoreline. Quick, short bursts of speed alternated with long down times, and they succeeded in surprising spectators as their rising dorsal fins suddenly sliced through the surface of the water, accompanied by loud exhalations carrying on the breeze. Despite the heat of the day, their powerful presence as they passed sent a shiver down the spine (all photos taken from shore). -Sandy Pollard -

Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: We're still shaking. They were right off our dock .....so close, so exciting. Best day ever!!! We have to do everything we can to keep them safe and fed!!!
*
There is one photo where
one of the orcas has a line around it’s dorsal fin [intestines!]
. It seemed they were feeding and stayed just off our dock for quite some time. It is just so special to see and to hear them! We are really fortunate to live here and be able to share in such a special moment. My daughter and her friend, who has never seen a whale “in real life” are here visiting. Everyone was so excited, ovens were on and all the food was abandoned uncooked as we all ran to the dock! My daughter spotted a giant fin and screamed “whales!” and I’m not kidding this time. It could not have been more perfect and they were brilliant as we watched them breech, and tail flap and roll. Magic! -Jan Willis

Entry 17:
Tacoma Narrows -

19:45 -
Saw what I’m fairly certain was a
minke
on the north side of the
Tacoma Narrows
at around
19:45 this evening. Definitely a baleen whale and definitely had a dorsal fin, but the fin (and the whale) was much smaller than that of a humpback. The proportions were too small to even be a juvenile humpback. I was driving so I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure it was a minke. -Dave Mullbock

HUMPBACK WHALES -

Entry 22:
South Sound -
Last Sunday 6/26, during our mini-heat spell, I went paddle-boarding about

17:30
, but it was still so warm that I headed to McMicken Island and hid out in the lee of the island for some shade. While hanging out there I heard the humpback blow and spotted it
south of Herron Island
. Eventually it headed south of Fudge Point, next thing I knew the whale surfaced about 150 yards away, heading back north, and treated me to a close pass! It stayed on the surface for about 5 breaths. -David Berliner
