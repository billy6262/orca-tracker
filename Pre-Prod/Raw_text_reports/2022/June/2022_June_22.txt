11:00 -
12:10, J-Pod
leader seen at
11:00, milling
1.2 miles south of Westside Preserve Landbank
. I didn't see the anyone else for 44 minutes and as they came into view they were
spread out, northbound
. 2 orcas came close to shore in the kelp then left quickly. I believe the leader was
J19 Shachi
and when she reached
Point Edwards
, she breached twice and the group began to change direction to the south and went quickly out of sight.
J-Pod
was traveling with the
L12 sub-group
as reported by Monika Weiland Shields. Seen in the group
L94 Calypso, L85 Mystery, J19 Shachi, J47 Notch and J38 Cookie traveling with his buddy, beautiful J26 Mike
.

15:00 -
15:40, J-Pod and L-Pod were traveling northbound 1 mile south of Landbank
.
Within 5 minutes they had turned back to the south
. At
15:20 they were milling
1.2 miles south of Landbank trending north, then turn south
, out of sight at
15:40.

17:05 -
The group was milling near
Pile Point trending north
.

17:11 -

17:45 -
The orcas began to appear
1.2 miles from Landbank, northbound
. They were traveling
in the same corridor as a humpback
, big bellows and whooshes compared to the crisp blows of the orcas. All traveled past
Point Edwards
out of sight by
17:45. Photographed from shore.
