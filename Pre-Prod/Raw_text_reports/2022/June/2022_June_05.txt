Orca Sightings for June 5, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lee
[Andelson] and I ran one of our all-day tours and we caught up with a mix of
Bigg’s killer whales up in the Strait of Georgia. In the group was T124A, T124A1, T124A6, and T124A7 hanging out with T086A1 and T101
. They snagged a meal (we never saw what) and then had some celebratory antics afterwards. I didn’t get a chance to snag many photos, just enough to ID plus a couple extra…but this was one of the extras. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Maya's Legacy WW
