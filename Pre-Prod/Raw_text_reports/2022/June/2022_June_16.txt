Entry 7:
Possession Sound -
At approximately

11:30
this morning, just off the
Hat Island
. FOLLOW UP: It wasn’t that great of a video because it was a distance away. It was the tail of a lone orca [identified as
humpback
] flapping quite a bit. It was close to shore by Hat Island. I know it was an orca because it breached completely out of the water a few times but I wasn’t able to capture that… it breached twice then went in the direction of Langley. -John Shackman - Frame from video showing a humpback -

Entry 10:
Skagit Bay -
We had a bit of a surprise Thursday night in
Skagit Bay
. We had our deck doors open and were watching TV when we
*
heard
*
a whale. I ran down to the bulkhead and a short while later it surfaced again not more than 100’ offshore. We then watched for the next half hour as it slowly explored the shoreline over to Kukutali and then up around Flagstaff Point, surfacing every one and a half to two and half minutes. I posted some photos on a La Conner Facebook group and someone said that after it went around Kukutali, it did the same in Similk Bay. Link to [

Entry 11:
Port Susan -
“We had a familiar
Gray
swim north in Port Susan first sighted off
Tulalip Shores
about

5:48PM
then next seen about 1000 yds off Pirates Cove and Port Susan Terrace. Last seen about

7:45PM
heading towards Country Club. Saw this same whale with Shackleton about 8 days ago and last Tuesday swimming solo between Tillicum Beach and Mckees. We suspect it is the same Gray that was reported a couple times in the last week but were unable to get video of it to confirm.” -John C Storbeck
