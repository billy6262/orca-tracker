Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: I was standing on the bow of the car deck, looking at the outgoing cruise ship with my son. Suddenly this grey torpedo shot straight up in front of us! I was the crazy lady screaming with excitement… couldn’t believe our good fortune. We just returned from a Sea of Cortes small ship cruise a month ago and didn’t see anything like this! I was surprised at how long it took for the ferry to slow, but the whale successfully swam off the port side and dove. I hope someone got a photo!
