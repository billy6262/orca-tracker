Leaders porpoised around the point with purpose. -Sandy Pollard*Thanksgiving  Day (Nov. 24): Would the Southern Residents stay around for Thanksgiving and enhance a special day? was the question on many people's minds. Sure enough there they were in all their glory exuding their uniquely magnificent presence as they milled, foraged, breached and porpoised their way along the Whidbey Island shoreline in a spine-chillingly spectacular procession. With calm conditions prevalent, 'booms' reverberated across the water from energetic breaches, along with the 'whoosh' of exhalations carrying on the still air. Every encounter is different and some more memorable than others - this one was  exceptional. -photos by Sandy Pollard, November 24, 2022 -photos by RJ Snowberger, November 24, 2022*15:41 - They are hanging around Sandy Point area. -Luanne Seymour*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Larry NicholsDate of Sighting: 11/24/2022Time: 3:30 PMSpecies seen: OrcasNumber of animals seen: 15Where seen: Saratoga passage, just north of Hat Island, headed northDirection of travel : NBehaviors observed: traveling and huntingIf orcas, any males?: ?Any unusual markings?:Is there anything else you'd like to share about  your encounter?: Fantastic day to see this many Orcas (I've never seen  so many at one time).
