Orca Sightings for November 23, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) -

Entry 2:
Southern Residents in inland waters for 17 days and counting

Entry 3:
Abundant Fraser River spring and summer Chinook and Puget Sound fall chum runs used to regularly support the entire Southern Resident population in inland waters for weeks at a time in the summer and fall. Over the last decade, superpods have become so rare in the Salish Sea, we are now almost surprised when one occurs. The fact that all the whales have been able to stay for so long this month is a  positive indicator that there are enough fish here to sustain them right  now.

Entry 4:
Per an article shared earlier this week by the  Puget Sound Institute referencing WDFW numbers, abundant chum runs are certainly part of the reason we've had all the Js, Ks, and Ls here. After the worst chum run in 40 years in 2019 at just 164,000 fish, fall runs in Puget Sound have improved every year since then, and are coming in at an estimated 600,000-700,000 fish this year, double the number  originally forecast.

Entry 5:
abundant chum runs are certainly part of the reason we've had all the Js, Ks, and Ls here

Entry 6:
With the whales also spending a lot of time in the  Strait of Georgia, it's also a positive sign that that there are likely abundant winter Chinook this year. These fish, also called resident Chinook or blackmouth, don't go out to the open ocean but rather spend most or all of their saltwater life in inland waters. Scientists are still studying which fish do this and why, but one fisheries biologist I spoke to said the number of resident Chinook has remained relatively constant over the last 50 years, in contrast to the declining run numbers overall. While these fish are still declining in size (which means less bang for the whales' buck per fish they chase down), they're a big reason why we've had Southern Residents, particularly J-Pod, around  a lot in the winter months, even in recent years. -Orca Behavior Institute*Wed, Nov 23 - Puget Sound (K Pod) - Happy Thanksgiving from Point Robinson! -photo by Jim Diers, November 23, 2022*K26 from Owen Beach/Point Defiance -photo by Gayle Swigart, November 23, 2022*I think this is the baby K Pod member. -photo by Craig Craker, November 23, 2022*17:14 - Pods are near stationary as if all logging.

Just as I typed that, I looked up and  dozens of fins all grouped still, then a flip facing south! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*16:30 - Been watching the southbound group from Lincoln Park between Bainbridge and Blake for the last 15 min or so.

It was great seeing them  and the rest of the pod with help from The whale trail group who  brought binoculars for us to borrow. -Ricardo Aguayo*Really appreciative of this group! After living in  Tacoma and Seattle for 18 years I've finally seen the orcas two times in the past two weeks. I absolutely never would have if it wasn't for  the updates here. Had a great time watching them from Sunset Hill Park around 10 am. My fingers were too numb to type or I'd have contributed better! Can't wait for next time. -Sarah Nickel Smith*The research boat had quite a show this morning. This from south of Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge. -photos by Jim Pasola, November 23, 2022*17:11 - I posted on K pod thread as well but pods have merged and after some directional changes are all grouped together, tight. They were facing north barely moving when in same spot they next surfaced all facing south, it was beautifully surreal. They are facing southbound but are just drifting in one big logging cuddle under where the light meets the color, north of the ferry lanes mid channel. It’s  one of the most beautiful sights I’ve seen with orcas.16:20 - Southbound Js [approx. 47.513192, -122.432332],, Northbound Ks [approx.47.4330326, -122.403061].

Lovely  place we live and share with lovely beings. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*Saw J-Pod from Lincoln Park right before sunset. -LieShia Ong-Sintzel*16:09 - This is the biggest single group of orcas  I’ve seen since I started observing in April.

Two main  groups. Wondering if waiting for K pod. *15:33 - 2nd subgroup group, tightly grouped, east of larger group.15:29 - Stunning resting line southbound south  side Alki mid channel sightline approaching north end Blake (from Constellation Park). Sublime wrapped in orange from low sun filtered by  clouds.15:25 - Appears yes, a flip, at least for now. Pod all now southbound in slow mode. Several off north side off Alki including calf.

Super calm seas stunning conditions. All slow steady northbound.14:30 - Male leading mid channel sight line south of Tillicum Village, Blake Island (from very south end Emma Schmidt). Large number group southwest of him in resting mode. Few others including mom/calf on east side. All slow resting mode except spunky little babe flexing her adorable orca self. Lots of surface activity from her. Pierces ones heart.14:15 - Who has to be teeny J59 was making  directional changes in the ferry lane right off Fauntleroy. Mom continued on. Eventually so did little one, and then porpoised cute self  and snuggles right up next to mom in her slip stream. Northbound off  Lincoln Park close to West Seattle side. Others spread across slow slow resting travel. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*14:35 - At Constellation Park. 3 or 4 heading  north off the north tip of Blake Island. Another group further south near Fauntleroy. -Greg Snyder*14:06 - At least 3 northbound from Southworth dock visible from Emma Schmitz west of mid channel. -Mary Hartmann*13:50 - J pod leaders (including male) are approaching the Fauntleroy/Vashon ferry lanes spread across the channel  heading northbound.

Haven't seen them come into Elliott Bay. -Ian Trautman*10:05 - Kimberly Sylvester called to say she thinks there are 30+ orcas in this northern group. Wonder if yesterday's northbound break off group met with Js? Still too far for IDs so maybe  down the sound or as images come in. All still southbound. Leaders southern end Shilshole mid channel with others trailing to either side  of.*10:00 - Leaders mid channel out from south end Shilshole. Others spread tailing and either side of channel some more west now than earlier. So lovely. All steady southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*10:00 - Still more orca coming south.

Too far for ID but looks likely J pod at least. Series of breaches, and tail lib by mom with  teeny calf by her side. All continue on southbound.08:12 - Can confirm SRKW. At least three males, one 1/4 way to mid from Kayu Kayu, another just east if mid and third mid to west if. At least a dozen whales so far. Spread across  approaching yellow mid channel buoy.
