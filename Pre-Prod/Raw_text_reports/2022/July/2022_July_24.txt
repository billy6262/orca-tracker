WRAS updated. *Double trouble! On the left is T65A3 Amira and on the right is T49A2 Jude, who we saw this morning in Upright Channel. These two 15 year-old male Bigg's killer whales have been plying the waters of the Salish Sea together for the last week, and like any teenagers off on their own, we can't help but think they're looking to engage in some shenanigans. The T65As and T49As are two of the most commonly encounters Bigg's family groups in the Salish Sea. We've seen these two matrilines together over the years, so these two boys undoubtedly have known each other their whole lives. Both families are also known for their unusual dispersal patterns, with sometimes very young whales wandering off on their own. T49A2 has been one of those roamers for a while now, but T65A3 has typically stayed with his mom. Today, they were zig-zagging all over the place, checking out shallow beaches and little coves as they explored the San Juan Islands. On the left is T65A3 Amira and on the right is T49A2 Jude. -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI*Thu, Jul 14 - Hood Canal - Fri, Jul 15 - (Members of T65As & T77s) - We’ve seen a lot of the T77 pod traveling with the T65A pod so far this summer, and they spent several days in Hood Canal recently. The T65As are one of the few pods that regularly hunts in Hood Canal. Other pods have spent time in Hood Canal in the past but not as consistently over time as the T65As. Inside Hood Canal one of their favorite hunting spots is Dabob Bay. Almost every time we find them in Dabob Bay they are hunting, and eventually eating something. July 15 was one of those typical days out with Puget Sound Express from Edmonds. We saw them hunt and catch a harbor seal during our morning trips up there, and then when we found them again in the afternoon, they went on the hunt again. When we arrived, they were traveling close together but after a few sudden changes of direction it was obvious they found some prey. The slow speed of their pursuit indicated it was probably a harbor seal, and sure enough, before too long a seal popped out of the water in the middle of the orcas. Sometimes a seal hunt goes by very quickly, like in the morning, but other times they take their sweet-ole time. This occasion appeared to be a training moment where they let some of the younger family members do some of the work. Four or five times we saw one orca or another chomp down on the seal, but then they would let it go under the water. It's hard to imagine how terrifying it must have been to be that seal, but this is a critical part of how these killer whales train their young ones to hunt for themselves.A funny side note of all this was that T65A2 (Ooxjaa) and T77C (Alcyon), both teenage boys, were not paying any attention to the hunt at all. They were rolling around with each other off to the side, having a little bromance, the entire time we watched the seal drama. Eventually the seal met its demise, and the meal began. The playful celebrations we witnessed during the hunt and afterward were pretty special so I wanted to share some of them with you. -Additional video can be seen on Instagram or Facebook -Bart Rulon*18:53 - Still watching blows in the distance from Scenic Beach.

Several minutes later we found J42 heading southwest down Boundary by herself ...See full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter 40*Haro Strait - As I've said several times recently, loving these whales is an emotional roller coaster. Embracing them like family means celebrating their joys and witnessing their sorrows, often at the same time. Amidst it all, they are a constant source of inspiration on how to greet every day with joie de vivre and a grateful heart for the simple presence of one another.This morning was particularly surreal, sitting on the rocks at Lime Kiln in the summer sunrise, watching L-Pod whales in a resting line under the Olympic Mountains. It was here, surrounded by a dozen other orca advocates, that I first heard the news that the Biden Administration filed two reports this morning stating that removal of the four Lower Snake River dams is not only doable, but necessary to recover wild salmon in the region.While not yet an outright recommendation, this is a monumental step forward in a conservation fight that has been waging for decades. I've only been engaged in this issue for the last 8 years (while some have been involved since the 1990s) but it has been a marathon, one where you have to celebrate every time you're able to collectively inch the needle in the right direction. Realizing that momentum is building to breach these dams, possibly sooner rather than later, is a much needed glimmer of hope for these endangered whales and the wild salmon they depend on. 21:30 - Leaders off the lighthouse.20:50 - Steady echolocation and intermittent calls on the Orcasound hydrophone.18:41 - Cue K-Pod!18:04 - Still frequent J-Pod vocals.17:27 - S4s (J-Pod).17:20 - Echolocation and faint killer whale vocals on the SIMRES Boundary Pass hydrophone. -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI*15:19 - Just saw a pod from the ferry going from Tsawwassen to Victoria, 4 or 6 whales. -Andria Papineau*10:15 - Js and Ks headed north into the Strait of Georgia; no word on Ls since they headed offshore from the Hannah Heights area aiming towards Hein Bank.10:00 - Seeing photos taken from Pender, it is Js and Ks up north - went through Active Pass.08:00 - Others - likely Js and maybe Ks - heading north up Swanson.07:40 - Just south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse drifting south, facing north.

This morning for an hour just offshore of Yachats were four gray whales. Gray whales are often seen here. A red tide lasting several days had cleared up, and in between the grays were four to five orca, hardly ever seen here. For the hour I watched they were intermingling. Were the Orca trying to separate out a young Gray so they could kill him? I have never read, seen, or heard of an account of Grays and Orca intermingling that long, less than 200 yards off shore in shallow water. I am astounded. -John Marshall*HUMPBACK WHALES - Mon, Jul 4 - Deception PassSent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Natasha DillingerDate of Sighting: 7/4/2022Time: 1:09 PMSpecies seen: Believe humpback based on dorsal fin shape. Gray in color and close to shore so at first we thought gray whale.Number of animals seen: 1Where seen: Cornet Bay near Deception Pass. Coordinates from Google Photos: 48.4082000, -122.6150000Direction of travel : Unsure. Short surface time facing towards Cornet Bay boat rampBehaviors observed: Probably fishing. Surface was short and very close to shore (30-40 feet).Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?:Photos available?: YesEMAIL FOLLOW UP W/PHOTOS: I submitted a sighting report on the website, but am sending along a couple of cellphone photos we managed to get. The whale's surfacing was brief and there were a lot of power boats nearby so we never saw them resurface. We were sad to miss the orcas near Penn Cove today, so were beyond thrilled to have even a brief bonus sighting of this whale. Thanks for all you do tracking our beautiful neighbors! -Natasha Dillinger*Mon, Jul 4 - Central Puget Sound - 11:16 - We saw him [humpback] an hour ago in the middle of Elliot Bay.

The tip of his dorsal fin curls down over to the left and makes him easily recognizable. Many have called him 'Captain Hook' as the curl on his dorsal fin is very similar to that of T40. However, the true original 'Captain Hook', T40, is likely deceased. T72 has the nickname 'Young'. Just wanted to clarify that they are indeed two different orca.
