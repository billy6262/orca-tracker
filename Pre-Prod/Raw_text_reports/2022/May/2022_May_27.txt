Newest J Pod Calf is a Female! “On May 26, the Center for Whale Research staff encountered J pod during a photo-ID and aerial observation survey. The whales were very social, with lots of rolling both under and at the surface. During this encounter, the team managed to capture photographs and drone video of the ventral side of the pod’s youngest member, J59. From this, the team was able to determine that J59 is a female. Having another female is good news for the southern residents; the population’s growth is largely limited by the number of reproductively aged females. While one calf won’t save the population, we hope that J59 can grow to adulthood and contribute to future generations of southern residents.” ..."After receiving reports of J pod being back on the westside of San Juan Island, the team met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 0907. We saw our first whales about a half mile north of Lime Kiln State Park and the encounter began at 0919. The J19s and J22s were traveling slowly north in a tight group near the San Juan Island shoreline. The whales were rolling around some and seemed to be being low-key social. J38 spyhopped a couple of times. J41 and J58 briefly split off from the others before rejoining them again. We followed this group up to Bellevue Point before dropping back to get another group of whales who had just passed Lime Kiln…” -Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 28*11:05 - [orca] Amazing watching them breach!

[VIDEO ] -Gerald Graham*Encounter Report from Monika Wieland Shield: “We had picture perfect morning with J-Pod on the west side of San Juan Island today, complete with some kelping action from J35 Tahlequah. Note the seaweed on the whale's tail! They like to swim through and play with kelp, surfacing with it draped over their fins. Being super tactile animals, it probably feels like a whale massage.” -Monika Wieland Shield, Orca Behavior Institute*Heard blows in the night and couldn't fall back asleep right away so I slept through the alarm - woke up to J-pod noises - flew out of bed!09:22-09:45 - Only 2 orcas remained, way far out.

I lost sight of them by 09:45.09:06 - The groups became more active, some had already went north towards Landbank and beyond.08:32 - J37 Hy'Shqa and 13-week-old J59 resting together. Mom was on her back while J59 swam around her often spy hopping. Then little J59 lays on her/his back by Mom, both of them belly-up. Heartwarming and touching to watch.07:52 - The group that was milling is slowly moving north towards Edwards Point (a bluff just south of Landbank), other groups from the south slowly coming back into view. Some individuals laying on their backs pectoral fins up, just drifting and others barely moving with just the dorsal fins and blowhole above water. One of the larger groups formed a resting line.07:33 - A few of the groups had turned to the south out of sight.07:20 - J-Pod spaced out in small groups milling 1 mile south of Landbank, moving very slowly.02:53 - I heard a group of orcas traveling southbound. I put a rough count of the blows at under 10 individuals, but I don't know if there were more, and I had just caught the tail end. Later looking at reports, it was J-Pod.

No discernable direction of travel. Then they dove and we lost them. They could have gone back up into Case or they could have gone southwest behind Johnson Point. We are fairly confident they didn't go south into Nisqually Reach because they would have had to pass directly in front of where we were all standing. [map shared approx. 47.21921,-122.83179]. -T.J.

What used to be a common sighting in May has become rare in recent years with the continued decline of Salish Sea salmon. They were first seen in the Gulf Islands heading north yesterday morning, but instead of continuing on to the Fraser River they looped back around and came down the west side of San Juan Island to the delight of many islanders and visitors who had been counting the days since they were last seen. After passing Lime Kiln Point State Park and the Land Bank Westside Preserve in a very slow, spread travel pattern, they grouped together and came north again, this time with a lot of playful activity. We were so excited to see little J57 “Phoenix” and the newest member of the pod, J59, in a stunning group pass close to shore just before sunset. Welcome back J Pod! We hope you find plentiful salmon to keep you here and that we will be fortunate enough to have many more days like this in the coming months. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network*19:47 - 20:00 - At 20:00 Last orca passed Edwards Point approaching Landbank.19:58 -1 mile south of Landbank, J47 Notch curved in towards shore to the kelp beds.

In unison 4 of them rushed in towards Notch creating a tsunami wave ahead of them. They met and rubbed bodies along their flanks, then submerged as a group and continued their northbound journey but not before a huge single breach.19:55 -J37 Hy'Shqa, J59 and 3 other females raced by fast and tight, northbound.19:47 - Direction change! J27 Blackberry with purpose NB passing Edwards Point towards Landbank. J42 Echo followed.

And OBI Encounter Report: “Yesterday [5-24] was a very special day! J-Pod popped up in the Canadian Gulf Islands in the morning, making only their second appearance in the month of May over the last five years. Often when they head north into the Strait of Georgia, we won't see them back down by the San Juan Islands until at least the next day, but they made a very quick circuit of it, returning to Haro Strait by late afternoon. This gave the opportunity for a lot of very excited whale watchers to see them go south, then back north again at sunset on the west side of San Juan Island. While they were very spread out heading south, they grouped up going north, making it an especially impressive sight to see all 25 whales together. I also got my first look at the newest member of J-Pod, J59, seen here surfacing next to mom J37 Hy'shqa off Lime Kiln last night.“ -Monika Wieland Shield, Orca Behavior Institute*“Early in the morning, Michael received reports from several people that members of J pod had been seen heading north through Swanson Channel towards Active Pass. The team got off the dock at 8:37 and went north towards Active. As the team came out of Active Pass, they saw a single adult male in the distance. This adult male turned out to be J26, foraging all alone. The team stayed with him for several minutes, scanning the horizon for the rest of the pod to no success. After several minutes, the team left J26 to search for the rest of the pod. Over the next two hours, the team ran several transect lines around J26, dropping the hydrophone several times, but never detected any other whales visually or acoustically…” -Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 27*08:30 - What a way to start a day! 8:30 am and J pod travels eastward through Active Pass. Very spread out. A few spy hops and tail slaps. -Photos and video taken from the shore of Galiano Island. Cheers, Karoline Cullen -photos by Karoline Cullen, May 24, 2022*02:00 - Surprise surprise....J-Pod just went through Active Pass [mid-morning] and were on the Lime Kiln hydrophone at 2 AM! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute*Tue, May 24 - Haro Strait (J Pod) - J Pod surprised us with a visit to the San Juan Islands! What used to be a common sighting in May has become rare in recent years with the continued decline of Salish Sea salmon. They were first seen in the Gulf Islands heading north yesterday morning, but instead of continuing on to the Fraser River they looped back around and came down the west side of San Juan Island to the delight of many islanders and visitors who had been counting the days since they were last seen. After passing Lime Kiln Point State Park and the Land Bank Westside Preserve in a very slow, spread travel pattern, they grouped together and came north again, this time with a lot of playful activity. We were so excited to see little J57 “Phoenix” and the newest member of the pod, J59, in a stunning group pass close to shore just before sunset. Welcome back J Pod! We hope you find plentiful salmon to keep you here and that we will be fortunate enough to have many more days like this in the coming months. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network*19:47 - 20:00 - At 20:00 Last orca passed Edwards Point approaching Landbank.19:58 - 1 mile south of Landbank, J47 Notch curved in towards shore to the kelp beds. J47 came within 20' of shore setting the neighborhood dogs to barking. His surface vocalizations were heard! He was joined by 5 others surfacing 20' - 40' from the shore. In unison 4 of them rushed in towards Notch creating a tsunami wave ahead of them. They met and rubbed bodies along their flanks, then submerged as a group and continued their northbound journey but not before a huge single breach.19:55 -J37 Hy'Shqa, J59 and 3 other females raced by fast and tight, northbound.19:47 - Direction change! J27 Blackberry with purpose NB passing Edwards Point towards Landbank. J42 Echo followed. I heard blows to the south as more members appeared, northbound.19:37 - J27 Blackberry and J42 Echo separate, stalled very slowly milling 1 mile south of Landbank.19:14 - J31 with J56.18:51 - 2 orcas traveling together burst up with 5 breaches one after another.18:30 - J46 Star followed by J37 Hy'shqa and little J59 who leaps out of the water.18:17 - J35 Tahlequah, J57 Phoenix and J47 Notch traveling south in a tight group. Mom and her two sons.18:05 - J-Pod leader southbound at Edwards Pt followed by another. Moving quickly.Filmed and photographed from shore, cropped and enlarged. -Michelline Halliday, SJI*14:40 - Killer whale echolocation on the SIMRES hydrophone in Boundary Pass, presumed to be J-Pod.And OBI Encounter Report: “Yesterday [5-24] was a very special day! J-Pod popped up in the Canadian Gulf Islands in the morning, making only their second appearance in the month of May over the last five years. Often when they head north into the Strait of Georgia, we won't see them back down by the San Juan Islands until at least the next day, but they made a very quick circuit of it, returning to Haro Strait by late afternoon. This gave the opportunity for a lot of very excited whale watchers to see them go south, then back north again at sunset on the west side of San Juan Island.While they were very spread out heading south, they grouped up going north, making it an especially impressive sight to see all 25 whales together. I also got my first look at the newest member of J-Pod, J59, seen here surfacing next to mom J37 Hy'shqa off Lime Kiln last night. “ -Monika Wieland Shield, Orca Behavior Institute - J59, seen here surfacing next to mom J37 Hy'shqa off Lime Kiln. -photo by Monika Wieland Shields, May 24, 2022*“Early in the morning, Michael received reports from several people that members of J pod had been seen heading north through Swanson Channel towards Active Pass. The team got off the dock at 8:37 and went north towards Active.As the team came out of Active Pass, they saw a single adult male in the distance. This adult male turned out to be J26, foraging all alone. The team stayed with him for several minutes, scanning the horizon for the rest of the pod to no success. After several minutes, the team left J26 to search for the rest of the pod. Over the next two hours, the team ran several transect lines around J26, dropping the hydrophone several times, but never detected any other whales visually or acoustically…” -Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 27
