It was too far out and only viewing with binoculars. 12:03 - We are standing on Owen's Beach watching the Saratoga close to Gig Harbor and can see a humpback there. However, another spotter here is also saying there is a humpback in between Dunes and Point Ruston. I know there have been rumors of two. Maybe they could confirm that there is two in the water. April Basham and I both confirmed the one on the Gig Harbor side however it was other spotters who saw the one headed towards Point Ruston. -Candace Gavin*11:45 - [humpback] fluke shot diving off Southeast Vashon heading southwest.11:37 - [humpback] spotted from Pt Defiance: west Owens Beach looking toward southwest corner of Vashon.

One more gray came by for a late happy hour tonight around 6:15pm, and it looks really familiar. I was able to get some good pec shots and a couple of face/upper body, so I’m guessing it will be enough to identify this delightful gray friend. It zoomed by pretty quickly once it noticed two pleasure-craft bobbing and watching and headed down toward Polnell. Little Patch based on the line on its face maybe? [gray CRC2356]. -Marianne Parry18:15 - Gray whale CRC2356 Mariner's CoveID: Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network -photos by Marianne Parry, May 8, 2022*16:00 - Gray feeding northbound at Mariners' Cove/Whidbey. Wow – busy whale day! I’m not sure if this is the same gray that just passed by southbound an hour ago, but a gray just cruised by northbound at Mariners’ Cove around 4pm. It appears to be feeding a bit but is moving steadily up the beach as opposed to the one earlier that was seriously chowing down. -Marianne Parry*14:45-15:15 - Gray feeding at Mariners' Cove, southbound. I’ve been watching a gray feeding out here at the Happy Meal Mudflats for half an hour – back and forth but finally moved southward toward Polnell. I took photos and will send them later, but I think it might have been the one that has the big hump behind the blowholes (from a couple of weeks ago). Gorgeous day out here but the wind has picked up and my camera fingers are frozen – lol! Enjoy your day! Go Grays! -Marianne Parry[ID notes per Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective (CRC): "The whale in this selection of photos is CRC2440. Interesting it has moved into that area."]14:45-15:15 - CRC2440 (2022 newbie ) Mariner Cove - ID: Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective -photos by Marianne Parry, May 8, 2022*14:15 - [grays] heading into Crescent Harbor.14:02 - Gray whales at Maylor Point. At least 2. -Lauren BM*08:39 - I’m seeing a puff prob mid-channel between Mariners’ Cove and Maple Grove beach on Camano, and it’s slowly working its way south. I suspect there were grays here by our beach earlier this morning because I saw a neighbor boating back from the south at a waaaay too early hour to be any other reason. -Marianne Parry*Sun, May 8 - Port Susan - 15:10 – [gray] Moving fast south now lost him.14:58 - Gray Whale in front of Port Susan we are watching it mid channel from the beach [map: between Kayak Pt & Spi-bee-dah]. -Kristen Bogren*Sun, May 8 - Possession Sound - Strange behavior between Hat and Jetty Island for about the last half hour. I was kayaking out by the buoy and a fast-moving gray adult surface about 30 yards from me on a bee line course right at me. I got out of the way, and it went straight to the southern tip of Jetty Island. After changing my underwear, I could see it was heading for a much smaller gray that seemed to be in distress very near the Navy yard. It looked like several straight up blows, like Orca with a tiny heart blown in the middle, could have been just the gray breathing a lot in distress?? They headed south the back towards the southern tip of Hat Island not feeding and inseparable. They just seem to be relaxing. Been doing this over 5 years and I've never seen anything like it out here. Hope the little one is okay. -Jay Irwin  May 7 BIGGS/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Sat, May 7 - Rosario Strait (T124As and T87) - 17:54 - I just went to WA park to look.

She is at the Keystone ferry, Coupeville parking lot looking south-ish. She spotted at least two orcas in the far distance, sightline just south of Fort Flagler, Marrowstone Island. Orcas were moving to her right so could be moving west or northbound, wasn't clear from her angle. Male described as notched. (Sarah looked up Chainsaw it wasn't him, so maybe T87 or another notched male - alb). * Cascadia Region Whale Sighting Killer Whale (Orca) Sighting: Sighting Time: Sat May 7 4:41:00 PDT Sighting User Reported Location (Lat/Lon): 48.51193,-122.68670 (Anacortes Ferry Landing) Number Sighted: 3 Reported Animal Status: Submitted Comments: video on snap chap maps/ Report Generated: Sun May 8 4:49:02 PDT 2022 Submitter Name: Brenda Molloy Whale Alert App * HUMPBACK WHALES - Sat, May 7 - Puget Sound (BCY1218) - At 18:14 Maija Holston, WSF Marine Ops emailed: Whale.

Number Sighted: 2 Reported Animal Status: Live Submitter Name: ShiSh Whale Alert App * Sat, May 7 - North Saratoga Passage - 21:30 - Grays (2 or more) feeding near Mariners' Cove/Whidbey. I just got home tonight and heard the familiar sound of grays at the Happy Meal Mudflats as I got out of the car – yay! It was dark so I couldn’t see them, but it sounded like more than one, based on the frequency of the blows. I think they were heading south toward Polnell, but they weren’t moving quickly at all – they hung around for at least ten minutes in one area before they became slightly harder to hear. Nice to know they’re still in the area! Have a great day! Go Grays! -Marianne Parry * Sat, May 7 – Skagit Bay - 18:24 - CRC56 and CRC2356 are northbound in Skagit Bay 18:00 - CRC2440 is southbound along the eastern shore of Whidbey Island across from Skagit Bay!! -Bart Rulon * Sat, May 7 – Possession Sound - 12:56 - Gray whales CRC22 and CRC2362 are north of Hat Island eastbound. -Bart Rulon * 12:15 – [gray] based on the rate of blows I am guessing there are 2. 12:03 – while looking for orcas I’m seeing a grey whale at the SE corner of Hat Island.

I’m not familiar with their behavior but I’d guess they’re on a hunt, they do not look like they are moving from point a to point b. They’ve moved west of the ferry lane, but not committed to heading down the Narrows or up Colvos. -Mary Moreno*16:00 - [if going Colvos?] It's impossible to tell. It's a long way from here I just stepped out for another quick look in the pouring rain and there's lots of splashing jumping tail slapping probably on a kill seem to be fairly close to land on this side I can't tell whether it's dune or point defiance from here it's not good viewing.15:45 - 3:45 viewing from dukes on Ruston Way I'm watching a group heading south looks like they're heading for the narrows.
