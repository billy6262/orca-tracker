Viewing them from the west side of Whidbey, they seemed to be closer to Marrowstone Island. The lighting was in our favor - and I was glad my camera was with me! All pics zoomed and heavily cropped. -Jill Hein * Are they finally leaving? After their prolonged sojourn in Puget Sound, the T123s made their way north in Admiralty Inlet in the silvery afternoon light on May 2. Photos from last year show they were in Saratoga Passage on May 3, 2021, so maybe this was an anniversary visit. Their continuing presence in the inland waters has certainly kept whale watchers on their toes, providing many shore-based opportunities to view these magnificent orcas in their chosen environment. -Sandra Pollard * 16:30 - [T123s] mid channel-ish and a few miles north of the Southend of Marrowstone Island.

They were moving North fast." -Red Rider 62 So, maybe L-pod? The salmon bite is good off of Santa Cruz now, and likely Bodega Bay. * HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun, May 1 - Attached are the photos I took yesterday [May 1], viewing from Dune Peninsula. The humpback came pretty close at one point. When I got there around 4:45pm the humpback was still pretty far off in the distance, over by the southern tip of Maury. Slowly but surely, the humpback made its way to the east, closer to Browns Point, but then began heading south towards us at dunes. The humpback then started moving west, past dunes, and into the ferry lanes in between Vashon and Point Defiance. Unfortunately there were many boats following and one jet ski in particular with two young men on it, harassed the humpback, and got way too close, I’m not sure if they actually hit it or not, but the humpback did a large tail slap and splashed them right in their faces. From my photos, I can see the person sitting on the back of the jet ski filming the whole thing on his phone. Several people witnessing the incident made calls to the police and the Coast Guard, and it looked like the ferry was yelling at them too... I ended up leaving around 6:40pm and the last sighting of the humpback was somewhere off in the distance by Vashon, getting closer to Colvos, but at that point we had all lost sight of the humpback for a while. Also, I am not 100% sure myself, but a lot of people out there yesterday thought there could have been 2 humpbacks. They were thinking maybe a mother and juvenile? -Sally Milligan-Smith Humpback BCY1218 Kata - ID: Orca Network -photos by Sally Millgan Smith, May 1, 2022  * 20:34 - [humpback] Just seen back at Pt Dalco. 20:09 - [humpback] Seen a few minutes ago around Quartermaster harbor -Anna Panasiuk Simmons * Thank you Cherie St.Ours, Jason Cook, and friends who helped us spot and learn about the beautiful Humpbacks this evening.
