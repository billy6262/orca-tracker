Again, I was pretty far away, looking from binoculars, but I would guess they were closer than the guidelines, and certainly over 7kts within .5 miles. If you get reports from people on the Fox Island Sand Spit (there were several people out there) , they would likely be more accurate than me.*07:12 - [Orca] No photos, but 2 males, 1 very small orca and at least 2 others.
