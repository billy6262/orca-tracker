Sure enough, L87 was the first animal identified, along with  several other L pod whales. This group turned out to contain all of the L12s and their constant companions L22, L25 and L85, and the larger  subgroup of L pod that L87 has been traveling with for the last few  years, the L4s, L47s, L72 and L105, and L90.

One of the males was very big, very tall dorsal fin.Is there anything else you'd like to share about  your encounter?: It was wonderful! To my novice eyes, it looked like 3  males with a juvenile, simple because the 3 dorsal fins were quite tall and straight (not curved as much as a typical female). They were quite a  ways off shore, so we were using binoculars to watch them. They appeared to be playing much of the time with the lob-tailing, breaching and occasional spy hop. Lots of porpising and going back and forth,  almost like they were patrolling a certain stretch before heading off to  the west.*16:32 - At False Bay with wind coming right off the water.

As we stopped completely, the female group passed  right in front of us (!!!) then zig zagged around, while the males were  further to the east. They all headed north quite fast, with the slightly  choppy seas making them lift their heads out of the water and create  beautiful water dynamics! Thanks to wonderful naturalist Colleen Farrell  and Captain Christopher Lewman, and the rest of the crew for a  wonderful day! -Bonnie Gretz - T77D Alcyon - T65A4 Ellifrit - photos and IDs by Bonnie Gretz, August 5, 2022*15:45 - We left the scene at my blue mark with all  of them northbound.

Other whales do it too, but the  Southern Residents are particularly known for their "kelping", where  they surface with seaweed on their dorsal fin or tail flukes. It's  likely that, as very tactile animals, it feels like a whale massage! The  kelp off the west side of San Juan Island is likely one thing that  draws them close to shore there, as it is possible to see them right off  the rocks within a few yards of shore as we did on that morning. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute - A whale kelping right off the Lime Kiln Lighthouse on the morning of August 4. - photo and ID by Monika Wieland Shields, August 4, 2022*The Southern Residents have been full of surprises  this summer, including "appearing" on the west side of San Juan Island  without warning, as they did this morning. In the lead was all of J-Pod  passing Lime Kiln, and then we were surprised by another group behind  them that turned out to be most of L-Pod! While Js were "all business"  heading north, the Ls were in less of a hurry. They meandered into the  coves and through the kelp beds, and were tail-slapping, spyhopping, and  cartwheeling. The first breach from Onyx I heard rather than saw,  because he was so close to shore I couldn't see him around the  lighthouse! Thankfully he obliged with a second one after I got into  position! Onyx traveled with J-Pod for many years, but since 2020 he has  been traveling with the sub-group of L-Pod we call the "Greater L4s" -  interestingly, not the part of L-Pod he was born into! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute - Now this is what we call an epic breach!

Hugging Bainbridge Island  in front of Fort Ward State Park. Stayed a few minutes there, could hear  them leaping, lots of tail slapping. Water was very calm and flat, so  we could clearly hear them continue south toward Blake Island. Not sure  which direction they headed after that.

I know T65A2 was with the main group. Last I  saw them they were along the point of the marina heading back toward  the Manette Bridge.20:42 - They've gone under the minute bridge right  up tight against the marina looks like they're gonna head for the ferry  terminal.20:30 - They are between Warren Avenue and Manette Bridge heading towards Manette.20:15 - They made it to the Bridgeview Marina and have turned back southeast, towards the Warren Avenue Bridge.20:07 - I'm at Lion's Park they are on this side of Warren Avenue Bridge and heading this way.20:00 - I jumped out of my car and left the phone  in the car.

They are trending northbound. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express*8/2/2022 was a fitting start for "Fogust" with a misty morning ride on MV Swiftsure. We were making our way up Admiralty Inlet when a passenger spotted killer whales! It didn't take us long after slowing down to view them before we spotted the familiar fin of T37! The group began very spread out so it was hard to get a count of every whale present. I thought I counted 7 fins but could only find 5 individuals amongst my photos, so I can't say for sure if everyone was accounted for, but we definitely saw T34 "Grace", T37B "Harald" and T37 "Rocky III/Pizza Fin"! They suddenly went from travel mode to punting a Harbor Porpoise in the air like it was nothing! Eventually they all got together to feed near the shore of Marrowstone Island but that was when we had to leave the scene.

Latest sighting at 13:45 S of Beverly beach heading toward Freeland Park. Still same gray whale been having, same markings, very unique [CRC2440] - 11 days now on and off!*06:00 - Hi there, We’re tourists on Whidbey island Bells Beach, and were excited to observe a cetacean this morning around 6am. Our house is on a moderate slope and close to the shoreline, but the shoreline view is obscured by trees and scrub. The animal was cruising so close to shore that it was obscured by this tree line. We got glimpses of its wake and could hear the blows about every minute or two. We saw one blow. Pretty sure we saw the blowhole when not blowing but never saw a fin of any kind. Could hear splashing at times. Only one animal was observed and it did not seem to be very large. It was initially heading south, then tracked back along the shore heading north. I got some audio recordings but no photos. I think 6am today was high tide. Wondering if we might see it again at next high tide.
