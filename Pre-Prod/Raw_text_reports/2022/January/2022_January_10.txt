confirmed by expert Melisa (thanks Melisa) -
Saratoga Passage at
11:45 am - southbound whales
. I have lost sight of them; conditions are really tough.

11:45 -
WOW just saw 2 orca heading south - very blustery conditions - passing Race Lagoon - near mid channel but closer to Whidbey -
11:45 am. There may have been more but can only confirm 2. Will send a distant photo.
----After an Orca Network alert this morning, we were REALLY lucky to spot 2 Orcas traveling southbound in front of our house - in really blustery conditions. Images are zoomed and very heavily cropped, but good enough for ID guru Melisa to confirm these are
T049A1 Noah (b.2001), and T049A2 Judy/Jude (b.2007)
. Wow what talent! We only saw them for a few minutes, long down times, and whitecaps all over. First orcas for me in 2022 - YAY! -Jill Hein

08:10 -
I just happened to glance up from my laptop and saw
two orcas
cruising by (near
Crescent Harbor, Whidbey Island
) - thought I was dreaming for a moment. One enormous orca with a huge straight fin, and one a bit smaller. I only saw them very briefly, and my stupid camera wouldn't focus through the rainy window, so no photos unfortunately. They slowly surfaced and went back under the water, no showing off or anything. Then they disappeared for what felt like a few minutes (prob much less), and then I saw them again south of here just out from the old Happy Meal Mudflats [gray whale feeding grounds]. It's rainy and windy with some whitecaps, so really hard to see much out there, unfortunately. I'm still looking to see if there are any more, but so far it was just the pair. Fun (and unexpected) way to start the day! -Marianne Parry
