Center for Whale Research Encounter #8: "Joe quickly recognized the trailing animal as
T117A
, a wandering bull last seen by CWR staff in late 2019 in the western reaches of the Juan de Fuca Strait (see Encounter #99, 2019). The others remained a momentary mystery, though by the time the whales next dove the trio had identified members of the
T086A and T124D matrilines, along with T124A1
. A quick reference to the DFO Bigg's catalogue then confirmed their suspicion that the remaining animals were the entirety of the
T071 matriline
, a rarely encountered group in the Salish Sea!
T124D
was also travelling with a young calf" [See CWR Encounter #8 for full summary, photos, and a video] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-8
