Today,
January 11, we saw
2 orcas in Skagit Bay
, heading west towards the Deception Pass Bridge They were taking their sweet time hunting in our back yard. Follow-up: The two orcas had very large dorsal fins, and one's fin was larger than the other. I suspect they are the two brothers spotted in Saratoga Passage. We live just west of Yokeko Point and
NE of Cornet Bay
. The orcas came quite close to our shoreline, pretty much skimming right across our little cove (we call it Kingfisher Cove). -Diane Christman

Entry 3:
Central Puget Sound -

I spotted two spouts and the unmistakable surfacing of a full-grown
humpback
on 1/11/2022 at
1:15 pm from
Golden Gardens Park in Ballard
. The spouts were spotted about an hour earlier. When it surfaced, it was on the move and headed northbound along the east side of the sound. But with the spouting spotted earlier, I'm not sure if it was really headed anywhere or just loitering. It appeared to me moving at a cruising speed when it surfaced briefly. The surfacing was probably just to breath but I hadn't turned around quick enough to see that, just the characteristic hump. I know it's not an orca, but a humpback in the Sound near Seattle seems worth mentioning. -Scott Bickers
