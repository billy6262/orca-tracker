Center for Whale Research Encounter #2: "Another whale was seen briefly further to the northwest but it too was being hard to re-find. We finally saw a male to the northwest of us and headed toward him while our cryptic whale surfaced a distance behind us after an extremely long dive. The male came up off the southeast corner of
Moresby Island
not far from where the original report was and it was J26." [See CWR Encounter #2 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-2 for full summary and more photos]

Nina Cooper called to report seeing a whale in Grays Harbor off
Damon Point, Ocean Shores
, on the protected [east] side of Damon Point. Whale was traveling. She presumed it was a gray, but then saw stubby dorsal fin of a humpback. Whale was pretty close in, did not see the fluke. Was inside the bay inside two red buoys, first time she saw the whale it was between buoys close to shore. Second time it came up, she heard the spout; it was closer to commerce side, then as it moved away was hard to see due to haze.

Entry 3:
Central Puget Sound - Porpoises active in Tramp Harbor/Vashon
this morning. At least five. I don't get the impression people care much about porpoises, but I see them often and don't know if you like to track their activities. Definitely not orcas. -Scott Hill
