Entry 2:
South Puget Sound -

16:00 - Case Inlet
, between Harstine and Herron Islands. Humpback spotted north of
McMicken Island, closer to Harstine side
. Feeding, along with many sea lions.
----I've attached some pics I took of the
Humpback in Case Inlet
which I reported on Jan. 19th and 21st. These were taken from over 2 miles away with a 600mm telephoto lens, and heavily cropped. I doubt there is enough detail to ID, but I'm sending them along anyway since I haven't heard that you were able to positively ID this whale yet. -Dave Berliner

in front of the house just south of
