Jill Hein messaged with update:
Little Patch
has moved south. Seemed to be closer to Camano, line of sight from
Hidden Beach
heading SW. Fun to see
#53 Little Patch
feeding along the shoreline again today at Hidden Beach. He passed close to shore a couple of times before heading southbound. Hope some of your friends arrive soon, #53! -Jill Hein

Arrived at
Hidden Beach at
9:45 and Little Patch

He seems to be heading north. We had a LOT of run off with the snow and heavy rain, and I wonder if it affects the feeding area. The water was very 'dirty' looking the day after the torrential rain.

07:30 - 1 gray feeding north of Hidden Beach
. -Nancy Culp Zaretzke
