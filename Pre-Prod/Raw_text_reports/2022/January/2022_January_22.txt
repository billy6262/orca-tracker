Center for Whale Research Encounter #6: "The encounter ended at 1610 about halfway between Middle Bank and the northern part of Hein Bank with the whales still heading southwest. The L54s and L88 were not present during this encounter. Everybody else in L pod was photographed by the end of the day with the exception of L89. Our friend and colleague Jared Towers had had the L12s up off northern Vancouver Island in front of Alert Bay on
January 13th and L89 had not been present then either." [See CWR Encounter #6 photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-6 photo - "

Entry 2:
N CA Coast/Trinidad -
Today, 22 Jan 22, from elevated shore position (41.099541, -124.158298), we saw a splash offshore around
1345, observed at least 6 scattered subgroups traveling north
into a lite chop, with some breaching by a big male. Spotting scope and binoculars revealed resident dorsal fin shapes, no saddle detail, didn't attempt digiscoping. About 15 individuals, more depending on how many were in the way offshore groups. There were 3 large males, maybe 4; 2-3 medium males, moms and kids. We lost sight of them around 1515. Seemed just like how the SRKWs spread out when foraging or traveling through this area. There were two brief moments observed of milling by single individuals. -Jeff K. Jacobsen

My friend and I spent all day at
Camano Island State Park
yesterday (Saturday) to try and see the whales, and right when we were getting ready to leave, around 330pm, I got out of the car to take a sunset picture, and we saw spouts! We ran back down to the beach to see the grays for a few minutes swimming by. It was an amazing experience! -Shelly Rosenberg
