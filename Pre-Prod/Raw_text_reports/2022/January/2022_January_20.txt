Center for Whale Research Encounter #4: "We then moved up ahead and to the west a little and found two loosely spread mom/calf pairs. This was
J35 with J57 and L86 with L125
. These whales then spread out a little and headed northwest with J57 and L125 charging around together.
L87
suddenly appeared on our port side and J45 was also nearby.
J27
showed up two hundred yards or so to our east at the same time and water streamed behind his dorsal as he surfed a wave for a moment. We were somewhere around mid-Haro Strait by this point-between Gooch Island and Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island." photo - "

Weirdly, the OrcaHello AI only got one true positive this morning, right at the end of the human detections. This 60-sec candidate has an odd combination of calls and whistles, but here it is. https://aifororcas.azurewebsites.net/detections/detection/294b0e97-fb76-4d66-8c24-6a0aa7a8eeb1?fbclid=IwAR2op2bdhtZNP7J2P9vm8k3yxmlcXw3jPe09eNpG57-eLW3GYTB5FtJsPAE

Entry 3:
Strait of Georgia - The Risso's dolphins
were first seen
Thursday morning in the waters off Campbell River
and again later in the afternoon near Nanoose. Almost a dozen of the dolphins were observed to be travelling south in Strait of Georgia near Nanaimo Friday morning. "This is quite unusual to see them and this time of year and to see them in the Strait of Georgia," said Ford. "They're not a very common species for British Columbia generally because they're found mostly further off shore and rarely come to inside-waters." -John K.B. Ford, research scientist emeritus at Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Pacific Biological Station Nanaimo. Ford says the dolphins he saw
near Nanaimo Friday
appeared to be healthy animals and were behaving normally. How they came to be in the strait is unclear. "It's the first time I've seen them in the Strait of Georgia (and) it's just a real treat to be able to watch them," said Ford. "They looked in great shape, healthy, so for such a rare event it's just a fascinating thing to witness." Rare marine mammals sighted in Salish Sea by CTV News Vancouver Island (Scott Weston)
