============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T69s) -

13:31-

14:47 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #7: "At ~1330 Mark located multiple blows on the horizon offshore of
Sheringham Lighthouse
, which turned out to be the
T069 matriline
. The 4 whales were traveling east in a spread out but parallel line formation, with
T069F
(the youngest whale of the group at age 12) quite far out from the rest." [See CWR Encounter #7 for full summary, photos, and a video] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-7

Entry 2:
SE Vancouver Island -

13:00-

14:00 -
We observed a pod of
at least 13 orca in the Saanich Inlet
yesterday (Sunday,
January 23) near Mill Bay. We watched them for at least an hour. They were in the middle of the inlet but closer to the Mill Bay side and heading out of the inlet towards the western side, meaning they were heading generally in a northerly direction. There were at least 3 calves, and 2 large bulls. One of the bulls had very distinctive notches near the top of his dorsal.
Follow-up: We only took one terrible photo as we only had our iPhones with us. I have excellent binos., though. Sounds like with 3 calves it's unlikely they were residents. Sighting from 1-2pm
. -Mari Wood

Entry 3:
N CA Coast/N of Trinidad -
And... at 0900 today, 23 Jan 22, I got a text from a local birder who saw a pod milling off of
Wedding Rock, Patrick's Point
, part of what is now called Sue-Meg State Park, a few miles north of where we saw them yesterday. And... at 0900 I was aboard a friend's boat to go 25 nmi offshore to retrieve a DASBR buoy that had been floating out there since Monday, didn't see his text until I got back ashore. It is possible that there could be Oo [Orcinus orca] calls on that recording, I'll ask Shannon Rankin to look/listen for them. -Jeff K. Jacobsen
