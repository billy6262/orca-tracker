----Day 4 of the
T99s extended visit to and around Saratoga Passage
, including a further foray into Holmes Harbor, sending nervous seals to seek sanctuary in the shallows. Although the whales came tantalizingly close to our viewpoint, they did not continue south deeper into the harbor after slowing down to flush out their next meal, and we last saw them in formation northbound toward Greenbank. -Sandra Pollard

Entry 5:
20:40 -
I’ve got a visitor or two at the Happy Meal Mudflats tonight. I’m not positive, but I’m going to say that there are two grays based on the breathing frequency and perceived locations (it’s dark outside).  I think they are coming from the north, have passed
Mariners Cove
, and are hanging out at the mudflats but might be very slowly working their way southward. I stood outside listening to them for a good 15-20 minutes – so special! -Marianne Parry

Dubknuck (44)
, Little Patch (53) and #56!...-Sam Murphy, Naturalist, Island Adventures
*

14:37 -
3 grays near
Strawberry Pt., Whidbey
. Moving toward Brown Point, Camano. Little Patch [53] and #56, plus another. Dubknuck [#44] was further south, crossing toward Onamac, earlier. -Matt Stolmeier
*

14:41 -
There is
at least one gray
, and I suspect two based on how close together the puffs are, heading north past
Mariners Cove
, but way out in the channel. It’s way too far out for me to see any detail, and I’m never pointing the camera in the right place when I try to guess where they’re going to pop up. One more note about this gray in case it helps with ID: my parents are visiting and my dad says that this gray looked like the one I saw a couple of days ago that I mentioned looked like a log. It presents a longer-than-usual length of its body above the waterline, which seemed different from the arch that we usually see. -Marianne Parry

Entry 8:
Columbia River -
Just wanted to let you know that I'm 99% sure there was
a whale right at the Lewis and Clark Bridge at Longview, WA
, this morning,
March 15, 2022. It was grey and white and appeared to be as large as a medium sized boat, in fact, there were log trucks parked on the Oregon side, and it was near to the shore there and was comparable to the cabs on those trucks. What was also strange is that there were other dorsal fins surfacing around it, and across the Columbia River. Appeared to be at least two dozen dolphins. -Stephanie Clemons
