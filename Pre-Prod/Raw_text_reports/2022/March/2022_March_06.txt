Entry 3:
Port Orchard Passage - ~

08:00-

08:30 -
We watched about
4-5 orca traveling south inside of Bainbridge Island
. I saw them just north of Fletcher Bay and followed them until they disappeared behind University Point. About 8 am to
8:30. 3/6. -David Sours

Entry 4:
Saratoga Passage -

17:02 -
They are both heading towards Camano Island. Added: It might be three since the one I lost was heading southbound and further away from me. Once I realized I had 2 near the base water tower, I thought he snuck back but maybe 723 left and the other 2 stayed. 1 of the greys looked to be much bigger in size. I left them
heading east towards Camano Island
.

16:19 -
Lost one, the second one is
heading (west) to
[toward, per Anya's map]
Penn Cove
.

16:09 -
Saw 2 grey whales from
Crescent Harbor
. Between Whidbey Island and Camaro. Showed me 2 tales and went down. Looks to be aiming towards Whidbey. -Anya Sika
*

14:03 - [grays]
Spotted them from Madrona on Camano. It looks like they're close to
Shangri-la on Whidbey
, still heading north, and there's a research boat with them (assuming research? Black & red zodiac). Added: If Marilyn is seeing Lucyfer at Hidden Beach and Anya was seeing two further north at the same time I wonder if there were 3 up there together. When I was viewing from Madrona, I kept saying it looked like there were 3 spouts, but it was hard to tell because I was so far away and, of course, they never surface at the same time. -Sara Montour Lewis

16:21 -
Now coming near
Hidden Beach
. Southbound. Added: I thought I saw 3 when you [Sara Montour Lewis] posted from Madrona and research boat out there. I had just showed up at
Shangri La
. Watched for about 15 min then totally lost them. There was only 2 when I was at Hidden Beach earlier when they were about a few miles north of there.

16:15 -
The one
gray
just fluked again, now
nearing Cama Beach
mid channel, southbound.

16:00 -
just pulled up to Hidden Beach. Saw one fluke middish channel in line with
Indian Beach, Camano
. Appearing southbound.

13:24 -
13 min downtime. Def moving northbound. Still viewing from
Hidden Beach
. My best guess would be mid-channel north of Onamac Pt. (Camano) and Shangri La Shores (Whidbey).

13:00 - 2 grays
, assuming 723 and 531 between Onamac and Whidbey
Shangri La
? Cannot tell direction but could be northbound still per previous report. I'm viewing from Hidden Beach. Loooooooong downtimes! -Marilyn Armbruster

10:30 - [grays] 723 and another
were NB [northbound] past
Camano State Park
at 1030. --Michael Colahan

11:35 -
The 3 joined up right before we left and went down the east side of
Hat
at around
11:35 AM. They were
22, 2356, and 2362
.

11:15 -
MV Saratoga is on scene with
2 gray southbound on the west side of Hat Island
another one is going down the east side of Hat in the distance! -Justine Buckmaster, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

12:17 -
MV Saratoga is watching
CRC531 and CRC723 off Hidden Beach
, northbound.

11:15 -
We had
CRC 22, 2356, and 2362
at
11:15am from the
north end of Hat Island
on MV Saratoga. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express
---- On Sunday,
March 6, we spotted gray whales
CRC 22 (Earhart), 531, and 723 (Lucyfer)
in addition to spotting
2356 and 2362
again! We didn't see Earhart (CRC22) last year because she likely had a calf in 2021. Researchers determined she was pregnant using drone photography the last time Earhart was here in 2020 so we didn't expect her in 2021. The moms skip visiting Puget Sound when they have a calf, so it was exciting to see her back again in 2022 especially knowing she likely brought another gray whale into the world last year. Little Patch (CRC53) was the first gray whale to return this season, once again. For the second year in a row, he arrived in December. -photos (531, 22, 723)

Entry 5:
NPS/Admiralty Inlet -
I am on the bluff just south of [
Bush Point
] and hearing blows. Heard one, thinking it might be gray, then heard again, several times. Sounds like may be going north. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Entry 6:
Rosario Strait - ~
08:06 &

08:24 - Grey Whale
sighted first around
8:06 AM from
Rosario Head
looking west/northwest. Hopefully these photos can help identify which whale. The tail was from the first sighting at
8:06; the other photo was taken at
8:24. The whale did four deep dives while we observed - we left the area approximately
8:38 AM. -Jacquelyn Owens, Natalie Thomas - Sedro Woolley WA
