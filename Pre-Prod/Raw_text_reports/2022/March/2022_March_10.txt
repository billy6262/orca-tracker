At

a friend messaged that she saw a blow off
West Beach Road
, Joseph Whidbey SP area. -Rachel Haight

13:28 -
There is more than one and they are milling.

12:41 -
There is
one or more gray whales between Joseph Whidbey State Park and Smith Island
right now. -Luke Schwantes

Entry 2:
Skagit Bay -

12:00 -
I see some puffs very far in the distance out in
Skagit Bay
, NE from Mariners Cove. I’m going to guess that it’s just one gray based on the number and frequency of spouting. -Marianne Parry

Entry 3:
N Saratoga Passage -

16:50 -
It looks like there are two grays out in the channel in the line of sight
between Mariners Cove and Maple Grove/Camano
. They are way out there, maybe closer to Camano, and I think there are two because I just saw two puffs right next to each other, with just a split-second delay (just saw the same thing again). They appear to be heading south down the channel, but very slowly.

13:00 -
Earlier today (maybe 1pm-ish), I heard some second-hand reports of
two grays out in the channel by Mariners Cove
, but I didn’t see them personally. Hopefully someone else reported more details. -Marianne Parry

08:30 - From Mariners Cove, gray
heading east, mid channel from Utsalady Point. -Paul E. Belanger

Entry 4:
Saratoga Passage -

17:16 -
Allie Hudec called: She just got report from her neighbor of two grays about 250 yards off
Fox Spit, Whidbey
, heading southbound in
Saratoga Passage
, slowly, not much surfacing. She thought it was a log then saw blows. This was different than the ones she’s seen going by lately.

I think
Dubknuck is east of Sandy Point
a mile or so. No close photos but thru binoculars sure looks like him, just not for sure. PSE is with him. SE bound. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 5:
Holmes Harbor -
We saw the first
gray whale divots
of the year on Mar. 10 on the east side of Homes Harbor on Whidbey, visible at low tide, north of Beverly Beach. We have not yet seen the whales. They feed here on ghost shrimp. -Bruce Schwager
