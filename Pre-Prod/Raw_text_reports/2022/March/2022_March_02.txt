Orca Sightings for March 2, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T18s)

15:55 -
I've lost them in the approaching fog bank, but I'll hang around for a while and see if they reappear.

15:40 -
It seems the orcas flipped back west and the porpoises disappeared to the south. The
big males (T19B and T19C)
are still visible through binoculars.

15:30 -
A large group of 20+ harbor porpoises are also visible much, much closer to my vantage point. Orcas seem to be milling still in the distance.

15:20 -
Looking SW from
Landbank
, I can see very distant fins of about
3-4 Bigg's/Transient orcas
. Still several miles out but appear to be aiming toward False Bay. -Justine Buckmaster

Entry 2:
N Saratoga Passage -

11:40 -
I'm seeing a gray spouting out in the channel
between Mariners Cove and Utsalady
, although it has moved south fairly quickly and is approaching my Maple Grove sight line now. My guess is that there is just one - a couple of puffs and then long downtime and quite a bit of distance covered. -Marianne Parry
