============================================================

Entry 1:
Saratoga Passage/Holmes Harbor/Penn Cove (T99s)

17:40 -
I saw yesterday someone posted here about the pod being in
Penn Cove
. I thought it was a long shot but went to Captain Whidbey Inn for a drink and light bite. I lucked out and saw the whole pod plus the new little baby orca! It was at
5:40pm today! They swam in and out of the cove, all within 15 minutes. -Crystal Prater

Freeland Park
.

Sure looks like orcas coming straight
towards Freeland dock
. I’ll get back. I don’t know for sure???

12:35 -
Marilyn Armbruster messaged with an update: the orcas (she thinks
T99s
, includes wee one) were ~300 yards from
Freeland Park
! She thinks heading back north, they are being stealthy, super long down times. -Marilyn Armbruster
