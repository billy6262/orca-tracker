Orca Sightings for March 25, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gulf Islands, BC/Strait of Georgia (T137s) - ~

15:00 -
We saw some Bigg's orcas on Friday around 3pm [
Strait of Georgia, NE of Active Pass
, per map provided]. Two pods got together after making a kill. -Stephanie Held
*
T137’s
went north in
Active Pass
today to meet up with a
Bigg’s party in the Strait of Georgia
. -Rachelle Hayden, SSOS

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T77 & T77E) -
After T77 and T77E broke off from the larger group they had been traveling with in Puget Sound, we caught up with them in
Juan de Fuca Strait outside of Port Angeles
Friday (3/25) afternoon.  In steady travel mode heading west with purpose, some sudden directional changes and lunges indicated they had an opportune snack.  A gull swooped in for a big prize (T77E is apparently a messy eater) and several others came in for a slick of oil that had formed on the water.  T77 did a double breach in post meal celebration and off they went west again.
These were also "new to me" whales and I had seen T77A a few years ago so knew he was dispersed from his mother and often traveled as a solo whale.  What was astounding is that the rest of her calves dispersed (with the exception of T77E who is now six years old) after the death of T77B a couple of years ago.  Because we know the role of the matriarch and that generally orcas stay together in family pods for life, it leaves wonder and curiosity as to why this family is different.  The more we know, it seems the more we don't. -Debbie Stewart
*
Today we got out on the water with
T77 Asja
and her youngest, six-year-old T77E Misneach. A few days ago they were hanging out with the
T65As and T99s
, but they have now split off and the two of them were booking it west in the glassy waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon. -Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 3:
Admiralty Inlet -
Nice Bigg's killer whale calls detected by the OrcaHello AI on the
Bush Point hydrophones early this morning (
05:43
on 3/25/22)!
Thanks to Orca Network for hosting this location. We've been hearing pigeon guillemots recently here, too, but this is an exceptional acoustic experience with the T08 calls (and maybe an excitement call) reverberating across Admiralty Inlet. -Orcasound - Listen for Whales

Sandhya Ballal called to report the
orcas hanging around south side of Three Tree Point, Burien
, for the past hour, close to shore. Her husband has been keeping track as they've circled around, they presume hunting. He saw a baby breach. She'll head out now to view them.

(~
13:12)

13:22 -
They headed north about 10 minutes ago. They were definitely hunting and eating. Lots of activity. Tail slaps, spy hoping, breaches, porpoising--it was incredible. We watched them, one large male, three females and a baby. Best day of my life! At
Three Tree Point
.

10:52 - 3-4 others
mid channel closer to mainland side, as well. All stealthy, headed northbound.
T65A
is in this group.

10:41 -
Seeing one lone male, so far, from
Point Robinson
heading north leisurely, island side of channel, very long downtimes.
T65A3
was the lone male, did not see T65A2
... Heard some folks saw another male after the pass, trailing mid channel, might have been him.
----Another thing to note, the T65A's spring return to Island waters was on the exact same day as last year. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not, but it definitely is something to note as we get used to the new rhythms of an ever-changing Salish. -Marla Smith
