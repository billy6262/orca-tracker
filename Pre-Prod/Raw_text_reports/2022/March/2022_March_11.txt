Orca Sightings for March 11, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gulf Islands, BC -

10:15 -
My location:  Stoney Hill, Outside
Maple Bay, BC
(North Cowichan) north entrance of
Sansum Narrows
facing Saltspring Island. (Lat:  48.803377; Lng:  -123.579548). Sighted a pod approximately 1015 hrs. The group appeared to be feeding for 30-40 min at the northern mouth of Sansum Narrows, making large sweeps from Saltspring Island across to Maple Bay and back around several times. Lots of tail slapping, some breaching, some spy hopping.  My friend took one photo showing 5 adults on the surface. I have one photo (included) showing a mother and calf. We can say at least there were 5 adults and one calf, although there may have been 1 or 2 more adults.  I heard orca traveling north at 0510 hrs (still very dark) and they also sounded like they were feeding for a short time in the northern mouth of the Narrows before moving on (20-25 blows with some splashing).  Impossible to know if this was the same group. -Karen Lund

Entry 2:
Here are some photos from 3.11.2022 of the
T99s hunting a Steller sea lion
in southern Rosario Strait. The hunt was drawn out and T99E was getting right in on the action, particularly towards the end once the family had tired the Steller out. Photos taken on the Island Explorer 5 by myself (Sam Murphy) naturalist with Island Adventures Whale Watching. -Sam Murphy

ON follow-up:
Traveled a bit south from my original sighting. They were close in to shore, initially, actually. Later I saw them southwest - too far away for a photo. They appeared to be thrashing around for quite a while at that location (off of Goat Island, Mendocino Headland area). Will try to photo next time. It would help me to identify the group next time, as well. Thanks for the prompt response. -Sue Ellen McKenzie-Bolt
