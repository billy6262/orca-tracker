Center for Whale Research Encounter #14: "We could see a couple of whales, including a male, south of them but thought this might be members of the
J16s
. Right when we almost turned back to see if the
J37s
were behind us, Katie saw more whales down the channel toward the west tip of Shaw Island. We went there and, luckily, this turned out to be the J37s. The calf was still there and was keeping up with its mom as she traveled quickly down SJ Channel." https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-14 [See CWR Encounter #14 for full Encounter Summary and more photos]

Entry 2:
N Saratoga Passage -

20:00-
21:00+ -
A neighbor alerted us to a gray feeding right outside tonight, so we just spent a good half hour down on the beach in the dark listening to our big gray friend splashing about and "raiding the frig" - lol. It finally got too cold, and the whale did not seem to be going anywhere at all, so we reluctantly went back inside. Tough to walk away though!

15:25 -
I wish I had more info on this one - it came and went really quickly! One gray cruised by fairly close to shore and I thought maybe it was heading for the mudflats (just south of
Mariners Cove
), but then it simply vanished. I heard a few puffs, which is why I was able to spot it at all, but it only surfaced for a moment so I got just barely caught a glimpse of its back. It was low tide, so it must have misjudged snack-time. -Marianne Parry
