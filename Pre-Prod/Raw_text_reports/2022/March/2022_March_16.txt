March 16: Here they are again - the

17:00-

We watched
2 grey whales feeding off West Beach (Oak Harbor)
last night [
March 16] from 5 pm til we had to leave an hour later. They were going in a large circle over our second sandbar at first, and farther out as we watched. -Teri Wise

14:00 - Dubknuck [#44]
outside the west entrance to
Swinomish Slough
. -Matt Stolmeier, Outer Island Excursions
*

14:55 -
I spotted puffs way out off of the tip of
Camano
(Brown Point?), and after watching for a few minutes with binoculars, it appears to be two grays (simultaneous blows) slowly working their way down toward Utsalady.

13:30 -
I peeked outside a few minutes ago and saw a gorgeous big arching dive complete with tail flip out in the channel straight
out from
Mariners Cove
. This one was heading south, and I didn’t see it again.
Also, up to the north
in
Skagit Bay
, there is another gray
spouting a bit. It’s pretty far out (northeast), and I can’t quite figure out which direction it’s going yet. Perhaps these are the two that I saw this morning up in Skagit Bay working their way down the channel.
~

11:30 -
Update on the grays - there is definitely more than one out there, based on simultaneous blows in different locations. They moved slightly east toward Stanwood and further away from me now, so the puffs got smaller, and I haven’t spotted them for a good ten minutes.

10:50 - Gray in Skagit Bay:
I saw a couple of puffs in the distance up in Skagit Bay, northeast of my vantage point here at Mariners Cove. It’s too far to judge any direction yet though, but I’ll let you know if they stop by for snacks. -Marianne Parry

grays milling in front of Joseph Whidbey State Park

Amateur here, but just spotted at least one whale rounding
East Point? Fox Spit?
on Whidbey. Not local, so not sure what landmarks everyone uses. Saw at least one whale's back, a few times, then several minutes later, we saw blow more than the times, followed by two separate trail slaps. This was at
2:11 pm, heading south, amazingly close to shore! -Bernadette Clapper
