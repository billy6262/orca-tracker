============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG/TRANSIENT ORCAS -

Entry 2:
While orcas continued to thrill people in inland Puget Sound, there were several more in northern waters. What a treat today to meet some "new to me" whales
off Sidney & Mandarte Islands in Canadian waters. T30B's, T49A1, T49B's, T117 and T172.  Say what? T30B's, T117[B] and T172
were all new to me. Abundance of Bigg's in the Salish Sea! -Debbie Stewart
*
We were so excited to meet this little tyke today:
T49A6
was first seen just over three weeks ago, and is the
sixth offspring to T49A Nan
.
Most of the
T49As
were there (just no T49A2) along with at least the
T49Bs, T30Bs, T117[B], and T172
, so it was a unique group! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*
We encountered
T30Bs, T49As, T49Bs, T117B, T172 in Swanson Channel
.
[video] ----When a report came in of some uncommon Bigg's killer whale visitors to our region, we were lucky enough to be able to hop out with our friends at Maya's Legacy Whale Watching to go see them yesterday afternoon as they headed north into the
Canadian Gulf Islands
