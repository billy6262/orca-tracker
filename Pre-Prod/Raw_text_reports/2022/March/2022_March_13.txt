Yes, we can confirm this is the same whale that
has been in Case Inlet
and matches both a photograph I took of it in February and an earlier one someone else took…We have not found a match to it elsewhere yet or in HW [Happy Whale] or our catalog so have not assigned an ID to it, though if it continues to hang around we will assign an ID. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research Collective]
