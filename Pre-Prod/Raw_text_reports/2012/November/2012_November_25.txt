We could hardly believe the surfing we were seeing from our boat either - plus some breaches, tail lobbing and a min-spyhop or two. So lucky to have been able to join the southern residents on the water today, and see the vapor from those powerful exhalations shimmering in the sunshine as they headed up
Admiralty Inlet
. Sweet dreams tonight.

Watched them from
Pt. Wilson
... lots of spy-hopping, breaching. They headed North then west... so they were a far distance from
Port Townsend
as they headed out the Strait.

They were definitely surfing! 5 or 6 of them, streaking along with just the tips of their dorsals throwing up a roostertail, then lunging ahead as the wave ended. The wave was going their way, so it's like power booster, but it sure looks like fun. We left them even with
Pt. Wilson
at the top of Admiralty Inlet, still spread out over miles, with no way to tell which way they went from there.

It's been fantastic viewing from
Fort Casey
. At one point a container ship went by, and 3 of them looked like they were surfing the wake! They were skimming the surface for a distance, so cool! Looks like they're heading out the Strait of Juan de Fuca now.

Fort Worden

Bonnie Gretz called from
Ft. Casey State Park
, reporting the whales just south of Ft. Casey, heading out Admiralty Inlet at
noon
. Howard just joined Jill and Clarence Hein at Keystone Harbor and called at

12:30 pm
to say the whales were just outside
Keystone Harbor
and off Ft. Casey - they just saw a huge breach, and it sounds like a sunny and calm day for watching whales!

Fog has cleared, I'm seeing orcas from Bush Point, heading northwest towards
Pt Townsend
.

Inspired by the sightings posted here from yesterday, I went out looking this morning. Saw only eagles until I was walking home and saw them, spread out and mostly headed northbound, just off the
south end of Marrowstone Island
.

Our houseguest just spotted 3 Orcas going by
Point No Point
--headed north about mid channel. The small group we saw was north of PNP at a few minutes before 8 this morning. They were going north rather quickly.

Our son phoned from south of Whidbey Island saying they saw probably
5 orcas
. I will see if I can find out which Point they are near and which direction they were headed. Their boat just rounded the
south end of Whidbey
.

Off the shore near the lighthouse in
Ucluelet BC
. Approx
12 noon
. Witnessed at least 4 different animal sprays off a small rocky island. Seemed to be feeding. We watched repeated sprays for about a half hour. Difficult to exactly determine which type of whale but from the brief view of a dorsal fin during one dive I feel they were
juvenile humpbacks
.
