Orca Sightings for November 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Davenport saw a
minke whale in Possession Sound
while fishing.
*
Ivan Reiff of Western Prince called at

2:55 pm
with an update on the
Pacific White Sided dolphins
- they are foraging at the top of
San Juan Channel
, and he reports there are AT LEAST 200 of them! Wow - what a treat!
*

1:15 -
Ken Balcomb just called from the ferry about
2 miles NW of Friday Harbor in San Juan Channel
, with a report of about 50
Pacific white-sided dolphins
.
*
L pod whales
were encountered coming down island along the
west side of San Juan Island at about
9:45 a.m.
They were spread from about two miles offshore to about a quarter mile from shore. They passed
Lime Kiln lighthouse at
10:20 a.m.
The whales eventually moved west and south passing the east side of Discovery Island, but they didn't seem in any hurry. From shore and from Maya's Westside Charters I saw representatives of the
L26s, L37s, L4s, L21s
. The individuals are
L92, L105, L95, L47, L83, L91, L110, L115, L27, L55, L82, L103, L118, L86, L106
. There were two juveniles, who would be L109 and L116, but pictures not good enough for proof of presence and a few others in the distance, but too far. We arrived on scene at
11:50 a.m. and departed at
12:40.

4:15 -
Sandra reports seeing
orca dorsals from Bush Point
now, still moving northward.

3:52 -
Sandra says she's seeing a few more from the north end of
Mutiny Bay
, still trending slowly northward.

3:40 -
Sandra just called from back at the north end of
Mutiny Bay
, seeing about 5 dorsal fins, including two males, slowly meandering northward out in the middle of the channel.
Sandra Pollard reports in from her soggy post looking for the whales off SW Whidbey - she saw two orcas from N end of Mutiny Bay, mid-channel heading north.
*
We left members of
L pod south bound
1 mile south of the ODAS buoy
south of Discovery Island at 1440
to follow up a report of
transients spotted from shore in Oak Bay
.

At about

2:10
or so I spotted another group of
four Orcas
, probably one male. North end of
Useless Bay
. Odd behavior. No direction. Lots of surfacing. Then speed north in a tight group as a Navy ship approached from the south and a tug w/2 crates and a coast guard vessel approached from the the north. The group seemed to freeze as the navy and tug intersected right in front of them. Then after they passed lots of activity including 2 breaches from the same Orca (J27 maybe?). Then, the fog and rain came in and I lost them.

2:02 -
I'm at
point no point
. More heading north by Whidbey.

1:20 pm - Js and Ks
have turned NW, now
between Pt. No Point and useless bay
, slow, spread out, closer to Whidbey side.

1:43 -
Update on
L pod
from Ron Bates: No meeting today,
L's S. of Discovery Is. going S.S.W.
and I understand J's and K's have flipped going back down.
*

12:53 -
Heading north west side of
Whidbey Island
. The first group I spotted was of 4. Including one large male, a female, and two smaller fins. (I'm going to guess K26, 14, 36&42 but that is just my best guess). As I said they were slow and spread out there were also changing direction frequently.

11:19 -
when we left
Picnic Point
, that's what direction they were headed (looking like they are now heading SOUTH), way over on the Kitsap side.

11:14 -
We were watching them from
Picnic Point
as they headed back south, way over on the Kitsap side.

11:10 -
Got to see a couple big breaches and a large male surface from a distance at
Mukilteo
around

9:30
, but that was as far up that way they came before turning back to the southwest towards Posession Pt.
Pam Ren

10:56 -
Like they do so often, poof. No idea which way they went, but I would guess north up the
west side of Whidbey
.

10:45 am -
Dave Davenport posted and called with a report of 2 males and 4 - 5 females off
Possession Pt. (SW Whidbey)
, between there and
Pt. No Point
, looking like they are now heading SOUTH TOWARD EDMONDS.
*

10:25 -

picnic point

It was

2:30
when I went looking to see if I could locate the
Pacific White Sided dolphins
that had been seen in
San Juan Channel
earlier in the day. It was easy, there were so many of them, where at the east end of Spieden Channel they were churning up the water. They moved down San Juan Channel about a mile and appeared to be foraging as there were many birds as well as PWS dolphins going in various directions. After a while they changed direction and moved back up the Channel where they began stampeding north for what seemed to last a half hour. I've posted a video clip, taken from Maya's Westside Charter's boat, on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.
