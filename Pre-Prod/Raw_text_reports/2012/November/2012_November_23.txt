Orca Sightings for November 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fri evening around

8:30pm
we heard multiple different blows spread out across a hundred yards or more near
Fox Spit
. Assuming these were the same whales reported by Mukilteo-Clinton ferry riders a few hours earlier.

When we arrived at
Mukilteo
at

3:30pm
the skies were clear and the rain was still over Whidbey, visibility was good. Overall we saw
3 large males, at least 10 females/younger males, and at least one young calf
. Lots of foraging & rolling behavior when we first arrived and then movement westward, then eastward. A couple of breaches, a tail lob and a spyhop was seen between the three of us (Pam, Ed and me). Lost visibility but stayed until dark just in case. The eastbound
4pm
ferry came to a stop at abou
t
4:20
a mile or so out from Mukilteo so we were hoping they were coming into sight but it was not to be. We left about
4:45. A total of about two dozen Callifornia Sea Lions "patrolled" the shoreline most the time we were there, they were pretty impressive.

Weather wasn't so great, but it was great to see them...I was having withdrawals, it has been a few weeks! What is weird is that not long after we first got to
Mukilteo
, a group of about 8 big sea lions came flying past us just off shore, looking very anxious and like they were on the run from something-- we wondered for a moment if possibly there were transients out there, but it was sounding so much like people were sure they were residents. Interesting...And they were definitely acting upset...the were swimming so fast they were breathing very hard, their eyes were big, and they were moving fast!

Certainly four orca out there, three together including a male and another adult male nearby (look like residents). That was all I could make out in the mist, but they were traveling fairly fast towards Hat Island when I left at

4:15 pm
in fading light. But I saw them, what a joy! Where will they be tomorrow, I wonder? Also a group of about 8 harbor porpoise close to the ferry dock. And yes, I'm sure those whales are residents...Hmmm, and I saw the biggish (for harbor porpoise) group close to the
Clinton ferry dock
. Wish I'd been able to get a good photo.

4:00 -
rain moved in fast, very little visibility. Last we saw they were spread out mid channel moving southwest.

3:48 -
Another group coming from the east...must have looped in
towards Everett
and now moving west
towards Hat/Gedney
.

3:40 -
Ed, Pam and I are at
Mukilteo
. Easily spot them due north mid channel looking at Hat/Gedney. They are foraging, two large males at least. Also...a dozen male Cal Sea Lions just passed 50 feet from shore...

Was on the
