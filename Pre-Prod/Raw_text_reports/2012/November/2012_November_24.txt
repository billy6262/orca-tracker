============================================================

Entry 1:
Approx

8:30 am
witnessed a group of
Orca
heading south off the shore at
Edmonds
(we were riding the Victoria Clipper) at least 6 whales did not notice a specific male dorsal. It seemed like they were just traveling.

Transients CA172
with another female and juvenile were traveling quickly west bound in the middle of the
Juan de Fuca Strait
. I previously documented
CA172
in the same region in
December 2010 with 6-8 other individuals.

Great sighting of a pod yesterday.
Southworth to Fauntleroy noon ferry
. Captain advised passengers of a pod of Orcas in the area. Jumping males with repeated near full breaches. Babies to the south of the ferry while two larger Orcas to the north. Sadly being followed by two boats and a kayaker. But absolutely one of the best sightings I have ever had and the ferry personnel said the same. They were heading south. We encountered them very close to Fauntleroy and it was a beautiful sight!

Still heading south at sunset...we thought for a time they were heading back north towards those few of us still at
Point Robinson
. Through are binocs we were seeing the blows of a resting line, but they ultimately those beauties continued south.

A pod was heading south off

between Lincoln Park and Vashon
