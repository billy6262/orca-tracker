Orca Sightings for November 3, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
T20 & T21 2.5 nm South of Beechey Head
(East Sooke Park).

I just heard a clear
transient orca call
on the
Neah Bay hydrophone (
11:06 p.m.)
. It's nice to have that one working again, although it still has a slight grounding-type hum.

I found the
T020's
headed back out west mid
strait Juan de Fuca
. The
T123's
passed within 2 miles to the north east of them on an easterly heading.
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
