Jim West saw
at least a dozen orcas
spyhopping and "having a good time" about

2:30 pm between Hansville and Founweather Bluff
.

Left them about

1:50 pm
, they were between the
entrance to Hood Canal and Hansville
(N. Kitsap), mid-channel so difficult to see well, but we did get lucky and saw several full breaches - one whale jumped further out of the water than I've ever seen before! hopefully they are jumping for joy because there are a lot of fish for them to munch on. Very thankful to be blessed by whales this Thanksgiving ~
