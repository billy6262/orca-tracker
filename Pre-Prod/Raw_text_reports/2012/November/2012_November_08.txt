I love days like today! Sunny, windy, cold, lots of eagles, seals, otters, good cheer and then...way off, over four miles away...a "puff" on the horizon! Over near
D'Arcy
, the former leper colony just on the other side of the border in Canada, another "puff" to go with the first one. I wasn't positive, but then as we got closer, and my passengers started seeing the same "puffs" I was able to shout out, "
Humpbacks
!"
