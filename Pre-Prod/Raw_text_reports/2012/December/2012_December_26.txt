============================================================

Entry 1:
At around

7:30am
, I sighted at least
6 (possibly more) orcas just off Sandy Point, Whidbey Island
, heading east southeast. Unfortunately, I was up on Clyde Road above the main bluff without binoculars so could not get a better look.

I am now just

they are out from
Cultus Bay
between the two green buoys directionally south west but still no definitive direction as far as Admiralty or south.

9:05 -
I just spotted
at least three Orcas
outside my home on
Brighton Beach
(just north of the Clinton ferry dock). I estimate that they were half-way between Whidbey and Hat Island (I look directly at Hat). They were traveling West, and there appeared to be at least one male (very large fin). Unfortunately I did not get photos.
