Orca Sightings for December 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:51 pm -
Lots of breaching and other acrobatics north of the mid-channel buoy. Getting too dark to see dorsal fins. Splashes are about all that's visible now...

4:44 pm -
I just spotted the first breach,
south of the Edmonds-Kingston ferry line
. They're still north and east of the mid-channel buoy to the west of Richmond Beach. Choppy water, no estimates of numbers or direction yet.

1:30
saw a bunch due north of
Point No Point
. [
Orcas
] came straight at the point, rounded the point and headed south and angled out into the Sound. Last I saw, they were still southbound. Once out in the middle of the Sound, saw one breach several times. I don't know how many--there seemed to be two groups each having several Orcas. One was a male--biggest dorsal fin I've ever seen. They were traveling fairly fast--seemed to be "on a mission." Amazing, amazing sight from Pt. No Point! I put my camera on continuous shooting mode and probably got 300 photos. I'll post some pics soon.

1:33 -
I'm starting to see something due north of
Pt No Point
. Lots. Southbound.
