Transient killer whales T49As
off
Cattle point near San Juan Channel
. As we arrived on scene this small group were hunting a sea lion. The two hours spent watching them they held and shared the prey carcass. There was a lot of fat and oil on the surface and plenty of sea birds. I recorded about 10 minutes of vocals.
T49A, T49A1 and T493
were present.
