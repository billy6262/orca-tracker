Orca Sightings for December 11, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Oy it was a nasty cold whale tracking day. After finding them at
Dilworth
(on Vashon) they continued to move southbound and were about half way to Point Robinson when they stalled out and moved back and forth from Vashon, mid channel and ultimately closer to
3 Tree Point
. Seemed like they were going all directions but our way. With more squalls kicking in, and fog coming across the water we lost track of them just North of Three Tree point. Jeff Hogan reported looking farther North from the Seattle side but didn't see them. Could be they turned and went fully South after I had to abandon the watch or they could have been lost in rain and fog as they went North again. Kelly Burns Keenan posted some of the photos she took today at the Preserve Our Islands facebook page. Pretty far for ID's but we did have some photos and ID's were
at least some K pod whales
so residents are at hand. Really don't think we had all of K pod though - just didn't see that many. Maybe 10 with lots of back and forth action.

right off the point. They must be going deep. I only see the spray when they surface briefly and then nothing.

Maya of WA State Ferries reports
3-4 orcas southbound in mid-channel of the Vashon/Fauntleroy ferry lane
. Amy Carey reports the passenger ferry from Vashon to Seattle also reports a group of orcas at about the same time, headed south.
