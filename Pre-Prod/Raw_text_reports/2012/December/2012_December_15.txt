============================================================

Entry 1:
Watched
2 Risso's Dolphins off Sunset Beach north of Steilacoom
on Saturday at
115 PM
during the Tahoma Audubon Christmas Bird Count. It looks like there were 2 in the south Sound about the same time last year. Also 4 Harbor Porpoises just north of Pitt Island by McNeil.
