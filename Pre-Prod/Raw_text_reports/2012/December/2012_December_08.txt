Orca Sightings for December 8, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
All 3 pods
made their way north in
Haro Strait
. Love these guys so much. So important to make sure we provide them the best habitat we can. Also, it's important that people stop supporting marine parks, it's tortuous for orcas. This is the wild, this is the real sea world.
