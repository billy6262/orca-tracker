Orca Sightings for December 6, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Karl Menard of the UC Davis Marine Lab in Bodega Bay, called to report seeing
at least 12 females (or juvenile males) and at least one male orca five miles south of Sea Ranch, north of Bodega Bay CA
. He said there were many sea lions on rock and the orcas were in water about 20' deep all around the rocks. They were too far away for photos.
