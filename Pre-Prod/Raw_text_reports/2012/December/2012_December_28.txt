4:45 - at Double Bluff
, there for around 2 hrs watching them hanging straight across at
Pt No Pt
, they hung out there for a long time, playful as can be, breaching, tail slapping, cartwheels, just having a grand ole time! They somewhat started moving slowly north of the lighthouse at Pt. No Pt and north of the housing community there and kind of just hanging too! I really don't know what they were doing? all I know is there was something they liked over there! There were many of us at Double Bluff Point watching.

a pod of Orcas north of Point-No-Point
lighthouse about

3:30 PM
. The whales were near the southern end of Whidbey Island. They were breaching just south of
Mutiny Bay
, where Admiralty Inlet meets Puget Sound. We watched through spotting scopes from about 3.5 miles away. One watcher reported seeing six or seven orcas.

We just got a call from Brandon Befosse reporting an incident from last Friday, at around

5:30 or 6 pm at the Ruston Fishing Pier
. Brandon and about 20 others were jigging for squid off the short pier, with lights on & their lines in the water, when
a 30' gray whale
came by the pier. It came right through their lines and snapped at least 5 of the lines, went under the pier and back out again. It was swimming just under the surface of the water, and when it left it was headed toward the Port of Tacoma.
