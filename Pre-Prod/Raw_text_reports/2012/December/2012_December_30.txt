Ken Balcomb was on the Coho ferry from Victoria to Port Angeles this morning at
11 am
when he saw a pod of
orcas
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
, heading eastward.
*
K pod
seems to be coming north out of
Admiralty Inlet
according to hydrophone reports and a call from Mike Waitt, who saw two orcas approaching
Lagoon Point
, heading north at

8:33 this morning
(Could these be the Transients still following K pod?).
*

8:32am -
I just heard a
call
.

8:36 -
clearly
K calls
now that seas are quiet.

Hard to definitively hear over the boat noise but sounds like
K pod
!

8 am -
Can anyone tell me what I'm hearing on
port Townsend hydrophone
? Heard them from about

when I turned it on to

8:23
. Great way to start the day!

a blow at pt. defiance
before sunrise today. Too dark to see anything.
