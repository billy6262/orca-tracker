Orca Sightings for December 14, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received this report from Susan MacKay of Whales and Dolphins BC at about

3:30 pm
: Thought you'd like to know that we just had the
Southern Residents
up our way....
Malaspina Strait passing Powell River
then angling towards Vivian Rocks by Harwood Island. I knew they would come as they do every December. Lost sight of them now as they turned and headed towards Vancouver Island and the West side of Texada.

2:47 - J Pod off Powell River
right now.

I saw
about 8 orcas heading east past East Point on Saturna Island at
9:00 am
this morning. They were moving slowly but deliberately with a full flood tide. Saw one spy hop. I couldn't get good photos for ID, but here's a shot of 2 orcas surfacing by the very crowded Boiling Reef haul out. Bellingham is in the background.
