Orca Sightings for December 5, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
Ft. Casey
about

12:25
- blows to the south, coming up from
Lagoon Pt
., accompanied by a submarine and two CG tenders. They moved steadily north past Port Townsend and
Pt. Wilson
over the next 45 min. in mid-channel, so no IDs. I was at
Admiralty Head
while Ken Balcomb was at Pt. Wilson, but they were too far from both shores to get IDs. The ferry went way off course, apparently to go whale watching while stopped off the Port Townsend Marine Science Center. No clear direction of travel out of Admiralty, but Ken saw a breach
between Ft. Casey and Partridge Point about
1:45
.
