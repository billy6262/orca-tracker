Seeing them now, off
Sandy Shores (south Maury Island)
. Far out in the middle of the sound. They are heading south. Spending a lot of time underwater, unfortunately. Not too many of them from what I saw, but it's hard to say, as they have not been surfacing much. An occasional three or four spouts, then down. They appear much closer to the east side of the sound than the first group that came through.
