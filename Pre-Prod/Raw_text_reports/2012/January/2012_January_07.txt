Orca Sightings for January 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw a couple of
orcas
off the coast of
Big Sur CA this morning
- as best I could tell, they were hunting sea lions as they went after a couple of them, though they left alone large rafts of sea lions closer in to shore. They headed north past Grimes Point afterwards.
