Orca Sightings for January 18, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cool! I watched him (her?) (
gray whale
) from the lobby at the Inn at
Langley
for a while. Also rang the whale bell for the first time this season! Hurray!

What a pleasure!! The
gray whale
that I called you about earlier finally headed off at
about
1:45
, looks like to the north. I watched it feeding in front of my house
NW of Langley
for a couple of hours. The whale was doing the typical feeding pattern of feeding for 15 minutes or so and then swimming out to deeper water, does a couple of big head nods and then circling back in for more feeding. I took some pictures- challenging in the driving snow! Got a good back shot and I'm sure you'll agree that its Cascadia research gray whale #53, back early this year! I did not get any shots of it's fluke and will send you more pec shots.

There are
two whales
(momma and baby?) about
300 hundred yards off of Langley beach
and heading towards Camano. That bell was the Eagle Scout project of Michael Scullin.
