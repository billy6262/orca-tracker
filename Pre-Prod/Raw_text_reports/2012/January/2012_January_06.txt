Orca Sightings for January 6, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:10am, 7 Orca
seen from the
Vashon - Fauntleroy Ferry
, traveling south
Submitted by Shango Los but observed by Topher Farrell

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries, who was out with the orcas today in Puget Sound, said
members of both J and K pods were present. They did see J16, but did not see her new calf, J48 while they were with the whales today.
He conferred with Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research, and they agree no confirmation of the calf's status can be made until they are able to have another encounter with J16 and her matriline. They left the whales half way between Kingston and Point No Point, just before dark. Brad feels the whales were likely going to head out of Admiralty Inlet (however reports below, posted shortly after the research boat departed, say the whales slowed down and stalled out - so who knows which way they will go).

The
orcas are headed slowly north

3:10 pm -
I've spotted the
orcas
through binoculars:
south of the Kingston-Edmonds ferry
, north of mid-channel buoy, 2-3 miles from the Shoreline/Edmonds side. There is clearly a research boat out with them now. Headed slowly north still. Kitsap peninsula folks may have a better view...

Sounds like they are finding a lot of fish, nearly every report we've had is of
lots of tail-lobbing
! KOMO News said their video even showed one orca on it's side tail-lobbing.

Saw them at
1150
from
magnolia blvd

group with research boat is smack in the middle of the
east & west ferry lanes of the Bainbridge run
, much tail lobbing.

11:36 -
They are still off
Elliot Bay mid channel
northbound nearing
Bainbridge ferry lanes
. They are moving fairly slow though they probably will take a little longer to reach Golden Gardens if they continue direct north movement at this pace. Also look for the small research skiff.
