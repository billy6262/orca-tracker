Orca Sightings for January 5, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw about
6-8 orcas
. A group of 4 or 5 and a second group of 2 or 3 following the first. We saw them from North Beach in
Port Townsend
around
4pm
. They were moving East toward Pt. Wilson. We left North Beach and drove over to the overlook above the Marine Science Ctr at Ft. Worden. We saw the whales just off from the lighthouse, but it was getting dark and they seemed to be hanging out there.

Fred Lundhal called with a second-hand report of
two orcas, a mom and calf, about 400 yards off the beach at Langley, Whidbey Island from
4:15 to 5 pm
. In light of the report of orcas going south past Ballard after 3 pm, we can't verify that these were orcas, or whether they were possibly sea lions rafting and sticking their flippers in the air, since we haven't spoken to the original reporting party. Or it's possible that there are some transients near Langley while the residents are headed south in Puget Sound.
*
S/V ORION: The
whales were headed south past Ballard and West Point between
3:00 and
3:30 this afternoon
. We saw around ten whales including a mother and calf who were surfacing more frequently than the others. Much too far away for photos.

Just got a call from the neighbor. There is a group of
Orcas heading south just going past Hansville
--almost to Point No Point about mid-channel. They were pretty far out. I saw about 3 or 4 dorsals at least.
