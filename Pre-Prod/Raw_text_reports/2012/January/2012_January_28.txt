Orca Sightings for January 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Greg Falxa and I saw a Gray Whale yesterday. Here is the info:
Gray Whale, Steilacoom ferry dock, ~

1:50 -
2:10 pm
. First saw the whale at
1:50 pm as we got on ferry. It surfaced west of the terminal, approx 80 yds from ferry. In a 20 minute period we saw about 6 surfaces, whale was traveling northwest. Ferry left the dock at
2:10 pm - and that was the last we saw of it. On our return from Anderson Island on 1/29 I asked the crew if they had seen it that day and nobody had. We are not certain of the age, but it was 'not small'........
