Orca Sightings for January 1, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
My last view of them (before it was too dark) was at

4:40 pm
, slightly north of
where they'd spent the past 2+ hours
. Perhaps they'll go in to Penn Cove under cover of darkness!

An email from Steve Rothboeck: have been watching them (the
Transient orcas
) for 15 minutes,
Saratoga passage
, well east of Coupeville. My best estimate is that these 2 Orca's were 2 miles east or NE of Harrington Lagoon in Saratoga Passage as I watched them between
1600 and 1630
today. :)

At

3:30
I was on the pier at Shangri-La Shores (just
south of Penn Cove
) and saw
3 orcas
cresting the water, midway between me and the northern tip of Camano Island. At the time, I thought they were dolphins because they seemed smaller than the orcas we saw earlier today off Ft Casey (2 adults, then a mother and calf). I'm wondering if they were the same orcas others reported. If they were, they looked younger because the arch under the fin was more pronounced, smaller and higher than the adult orcas off Ft Casey.

3:15 pm -
Jill Hein reports the
orcas
are still in
Saratoga Passage
, between Harrington Lagoon & NW Camano Island, closer to the Camano side, still hunting.

1:28 pm -
Long range iPhone shot of a pair of
orcas northbound Saratoga Passage
, shot from midway
between Camano and Cama Beach St Parks at Breezy Pt
.

2:14 pm -
Just got a call from Jill Hein - she was watching
7 or 8 orcas off Harrington Lagoon, south of Penn Cove
. There was at least 1 male, and a calf present - sounds like the group Marilyn just posted about below, but they sure headed north in a hurry!

1:45 -
We just came in from watching
5 to 6 orcas pass Fox Spit (Saratoga Passage)
, then from near Baby Island on Whidbey. Thinking it may be the group Alisa video taped at Richmond Beach yesterday, as there were a couple bigger males, and a calf with one of the females. Last we saw of them they turned just before baby Island and headed straight north.

About

1:10 pm
- [
Orcas
] were pretty spread out for awhile from
Baby Island Heights (Whidbey Island)
. It seemed like the females and the calf were sort of hanging together, while the males were pretty much roving around on their own a bit. I think they were resting up some, since they were taking their time about things--Until they turned and headed north; it was just awhile later that someone reported that they were moving fast, had made a kill, and were very active. We didn't see that kind of activity, just some slower paced travel.

Another update from Cindy - at

1:05 pm
she called to say 2 more orcas, a mom & calf, had appeared off
Ft. Casey State Park
- between the Admiralty Head Lighthouse & the smoke stack in Pt. Townsend.
*
1 pm -
again saw the small pod in
Saratoga Passage
, out our office window in
Greenbank
and from the bluff, at least one male closer to
Camano Island
, and females with young between Baby Island and Camano Island State Park - we saw 5 of them across from Fox Spit closer to the Camano side about 5-10 min ago and they are coming towards Baby Island/Camano State Park right now or fairly soon....they are a bit further north now, but appear to be continuing foraging. As Cindy just said on the phone, "Whidbey Island is being hugged by orcas" today - Happy New Year!

12:57 -
Just received a call from Cindy Hurn who is watching
2 orcas from Ft. Casey State Park
- they are NW of the Park, off
Ebey's landing
- must be the same 2 reported off Bush Pt. earlier.
*

12:50 PM - Calls at Port Townsend
, sound like transients.

12:34 - Whidbey Island is surrounded by orcas
right now. We have at least five headed north
up Saratoga Passage almost to Greenbank now
.

12:25 -
We see them from
Greenbank
coming north up Saratoga Passage between East Point, Whidbey Island and Camano Island, mid-channel.

Noon - about 7 or 8
, maybe a baby or two are in
Saratoga Passage
currently, near Bells Beach, closer to Camano. Headed North while feeding. We THINK we saw a very small fin so this may be the group with the baby. What a fabulous way to greet 2012!!!

11:50 -
I just saw
two Orcas heading north at Bush Point (Admiralty Inlet)
. They were swimming in the middle of the sound at a fast pace around 25 minutes ago. Very exciting!

ORCAS again today - heading down the coast! ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project volunteers ROCK! They watched
~7-8 orcas
for about two hours (off the
Palos Verdes CA Peninsula
); they breached many times, and also spyhopped and lobtailed. They started out about two miles off, and came within a mile of shore. A pod of
six gray whales
moved further offshore just before we found the orcas. A pod of common dolphin swam by, not far from the orcas. I just went through most of the images taken by Diane Alps and Bernardo Alps aboard the First String. IDs so far: the
CA51s
(7 whales ) and the
CA140s
(3 whales); I suspect that the
CA50s
(2 whales) were also there. This adds up to 12 orcas - the same ones we saw off Pt. Vicente on Dec 10, and Davey's Locker saw off Newport Beach on Dec 11. This encounter lasted from ~
4:45 pm until shortly after
5:00 pm.

Southern California was treated to a special new year's day surprise. A pod of
7 Orcas hung out off Palos Verdes CA
for over 2 hours this afternoon. The ACS/LA Gray Whale Census folks watched them from shore as they frolicked about 1 mile off shore. It was pretty amazing. We have not been able to ID them yet...waiting for pictures from nearby boats.
