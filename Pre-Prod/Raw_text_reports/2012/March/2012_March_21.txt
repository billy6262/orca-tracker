Orca Sightings for March 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb called in two indirect reports. At

6:20 pm
today David Howitt called from the dock at Friday Harbor Labs to say he was watching
orca fins, probably transients, across San Juan Channel near Shaw Island
. The other report was from earlier today when Farnum Alston was whale-watching in
Monterey CA
and along with several
humpbacks
and
four orcas
.
*
Believe
a gray
is having dinner in Rolling bay area off
Bainbridge island
. First sighted about

5:45pm
Tuesday evening. It is fairly close to the shoreline of Bainbridge Island and slowly heading south and now north. It is still in the N. end of Rolling bay.

Yesterday evening from

6:15 till ~
7:25, 4 or 5 Gray Whales
feeding, ~ 75 feet off the beach, NW edge of downtown
Langley
. I quietly watched from our bulkhead then heard the most amazing thing: one long tone of a whale song. Magnificent. Also, sighted 3 or 4 Dall's Porpoises playing 200 yards off the beach at the NW edge of Langley, Saratoga Passage.
