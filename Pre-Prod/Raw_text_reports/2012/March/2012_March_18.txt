An update from the captain of the Sealth ferry: now there are
at least 15 orcas NE of Frost Island, near the north end of Lopez Island
, heading SE. It's amazing how they can locate each other, considering they go completely silent, not even echolocating, when they are hunting seals or sea lions.
WA State Ferries called Orca Network with a report of
8 orcas off Humphrey Head
, at the north end of
Lopez Island
, heading east at

9:40 am
, and we have an indirect report of others this morning in
Maple Bay, north of Cowichan, BC
.

I just talked to my
12:00 passengers, who are on the ferry coming to Friday Harbor. They saw
whales between Shaw and Lopez Islands
, headed NE at around

9:30
this morning.

transient calls
on the Orca Sound hydrophones, lasting less than 4 minutes.

The neighbors just (

1:30 PM
) came to let me know
a gray whale
was feeding in shallow water right at Mabana Road (
SW Camano Island
). Went out on the bluff to watch, and saw mainly Scoter feeding on the remains. The whale was so shallow he really didn't need to blow. One whale watch boat keeping a respectful distance with their motor off.

About

9:30 AM
there was
a single Gray
feeding deep off the drop-off in front of our house south of Mabana (
SW Camano Island
). He moved out even further across (Saratoga Passage) toward Langley and I lost sight.

Transient Orca - Killer Whales - Had a report from a friend that the saw
2 Orcas
( one large fin and one small fin) northbound past Cape Mudge (
Quadra Island
, north Georgia Strait) at
3 pm
. Makes sense they were northbound because current was ebbing then. They did say the large fin had a distinctive bend in its dorsal. Sounds like they had a large number around Telegraph area yesterday n this morning as well.
