Orca Sightings for March 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:15 pm -
I just got a glimpse of
either a gray or minke
in front of my house on the north side of
Commencement Bay
(Browns Point) about 400-500 yards from shore about 45 minutes ago. Since it did not resurface, or at least I could not see it resurface, I would think a minke. It did have a somewhat slim and long body.
