I spotted
4 orcas traveling North up the Johnstone Strait at about
12:15pm
, viewed from my apartment in
Campbell River, BC
, which is located directly across from the Cape Mudge Lighthouse on Quadra Island. I followed them in my car, stopping to take photos along the way, the last I saw them, was at Brown's Bay, at

2:45pm
, still heading North. I've attached some photo's for ID'ing purposes. I know that there's an adult male, and I'm guessing an adult female with 2 calves?

Dave Ellifrit: The bull is T11A and T11 is in there too.

About 5 PM.
Just came in from watching
at least one Gray
feeding deep off the drop off in front of our house. Wind and whitecaps make for difficult whale watching! I think moving slowly north and west toward
Mabana Rd
.

I thought I heard
a blow
from our deck, just north of
Greenbank
on Saratoga Passage around dusk tonight, possibly the same whale.

Vickie Saywer relayed a report from someone on Whidbey Naval Air Station (north of Oak Harbor) of
two probable gray whales
near the beach at the north end of the base in the
afternoon
.

Sue Miller called to report seeing
six Dall's porpoises at Point Robinson, Vashon Island
Friday about
noon
