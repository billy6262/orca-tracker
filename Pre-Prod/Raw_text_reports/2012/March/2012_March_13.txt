Orca Sightings for March 13, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:35 pm -
Today as we walked along the beach below Camano Head, a single
grey whale
slowly worked its way from the west towards the waters
between Hat Island and Camano Head
. Didn't seem to be in much of a hurry, came up for air w/o going much distance. It was about 100 yards from shore.
