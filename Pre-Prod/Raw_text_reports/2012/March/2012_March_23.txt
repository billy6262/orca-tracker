Orca Sightings for March 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

1:40 pm
today,
5 orcas
swam westward through
Active Pass
. They did some rapid porpoising as the ferry went by them. Transients?
Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island, BC

We have water frontage in Saltair, BC (about 20 miles
south of Nanaimo
). Our location is approximately 123-46-12 lat by 48-57-48 Long. My husband spotted unusual activity outside. Around
5 PM
, our son yelled "
Orcas
!" A pod of about
7 members
were about 100 feet off our beach in we figure about 20 feet of water. We assume that there were three adults to young whales (one to be the male, much larger than the others). They occasionally slapped the water with their flukes. They moved southward towards Chemainus.
