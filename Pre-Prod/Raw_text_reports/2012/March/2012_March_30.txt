11:20 am -
a call came in that there were
Hundreds of fast moving Pacific White Sided Dolphins
between Black Point and Myrtle Rocks heading Northward towards
Powell River
. The ocean was a massive foaming boil from their fast maneuvers. They just seemed to disappear.

3:45 pm - Three Orca
two large dorsals and one small one were very slowly moving Northward right where the Dolphins (
Powell River
, above) had been. They were doing long dives and just taking their time.

about
8 orca
of all sizes coming north up the middle of the
Malaspina Strait
past Myrtle Rocks. They were rolling and diving and tail slapping and one breach. Too far away for a photo unfortunately.
