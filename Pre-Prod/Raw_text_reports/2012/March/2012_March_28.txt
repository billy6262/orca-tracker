J pod calls
on the

. An hour later their calls were heard more clearly, still on Orca Sound hydrophones and soon began on Lime Kiln. I spotted one whale cartwheeling, south of Kelp Reef marker heading toward Discovery. Then at

apx 1/2 mile from shore heading down island. I could then see another on the east side of Discovery Island heading out. The whales were spread all across Haro Strait heading down and west.
