A group of 7 kayakers from the Hole In The Wall Kayaking Club spotted
a Humpback Whale
between Sares Head and Northwest Island, just North of Bowman Bay on
Fidalgo Island
(just northwest of Deception Pass Bridge). At about

2:30 PM
. We could see its blows in the distance as we traveled south from Williamson Rocks. It appeared multiple times surfacing in between deep dives after showing it's tail. It was a perfect way to finish a day's paddle.

I was kayaking w/a group on Sat. 3/10 & we saw
1 lone humpback whale
just north of Bowman Bay, near
Deception Pass
. It was about
3 PM
. It seemed to be hanging in that area, but it dove & we lost track of it.=

I caught one quick glimpse of a very short hook shaped fin very close to shore at

1:30
today at
Lagoon Point
. I believe it was a Minke Whale?

From Al Luneman at

9:48 am
, from Ebey's bluff,
Coupeville
, Whidbey Island: Just sighted something? ~ 1 mile out seeming to move slowly south (in Admiralty Inlet). It would only come up every few minutes and seemed to have a small dorsal (larger than a minke, but smaller by far than an orca). And not a flipper of a sea lion. No spout visible and just came up briefly each time and before i could get binocs on it for better look. A single large porpoise...? other...? any thoughts
