There is
one gray whale
feeding between due south of us, just west of the
Camano Head/Hat Island
passage, about 200 yards off shore. We watched it feed in the same area for about five minutes, at

10:00 this morning
, before it headed out of sight towards Everett. We've seen the whale here before this month, perhaps there is a new area of available food this year.
