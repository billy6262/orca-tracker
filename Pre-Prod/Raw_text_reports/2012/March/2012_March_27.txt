Someone just came to my desk to say he saw
a gray whale
just offshore on the Northwest side of the

, Oak Harbor, earlier this afternoon.

This is my first sighting of the year from my office, about

3:15 PM
. A bit later in the year than usual but definitely
a single Grey whale
feeding about 500 feet out, West of the Norwester building (
Naval Air Station, Whidbey
). He/She seems to be awfully close to a group of commercial crab pots! Hope they don't get tangled up. This is just down a couple hundred yards South of the airfield runway itself. Gray whale is generally moving North at this point
