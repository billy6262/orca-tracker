We were at Neck Point Park in
Nanaimo, at around 11 am
, at a spot facing North looking up the Strait and saw
5 Orcas
about 100 yards off shore. One had a very large dorsal fin and there appeared to be a baby with them. This sighting was just before the Herring spawn reached here from the north. We were very excited to see this pod.
