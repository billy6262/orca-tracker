Orca Sightings for March 3, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got a report from my friend Josh Duncan on the Western King (commercial fishing vessel) that he saw
13 Orca heading just north of Seymour Narrows
(Campbell River area) in a northerly direction. He said there were 3 large fins in the pod. I asked if he took photos and if he noticed any notches in the dorsals but no reply yet.
130 pm
(He didn't take any photos, and didn't notice any notches. No additional information to this posting time. Susan)
