============================================================

Orca Sound hydrophones at approximately
10:15a.m.
a few faint
transient calls
; again at about

10:30
still faint but a longer duration of intermittent calls for several minutes; and then at about

11:30a.m
. there was a burst of calls/sounds lasting about 27 seconds. See my blog Whale of A Purpose to hear the 27 second clip of those interesting calls/sounds that occurred. Rough seas made it difficult to locate the animals from shore, though some people were looking.
