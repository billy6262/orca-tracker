============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw the
T124s
on Saturday also, but with a different male.

In
Boundary Pass
the whales I saw were
T12A, the T124As and the T109As.
The T109As I had seen on Sept. 2, 2011 off the Victoria waterfront and at that time there were 3 members of that group. Today,
March 17th, there was an additional young whale,
a baby
, still with yellowish tinge, just not a brand new baby. I think that T109A had her third offspring, sometime after 9/2/11. Both of these encounters were while on Maya's Westside Charters.

As we were scanning Boundary Pass, we got a call that
a group of Transients were just below Pender Island
, so off we went. Soon we could see a group of what appeared to be
8-9 Transient Orcas!
They must have just made a kill as there were lots of seagulls around, and the whales were milling about and playing a bit. So we dropped the hydrophone just on the off-chance they might vocalize a bit. And
the vocals were stunning
. So many whistles and clicks, almost Resident-orca-ish! Lots of surface percussive behavior. Then the lone big male (that was later ID'd by Dave Ellifritt from the Center as
T12A
) had a huge breach! His huge pectoral fins and wavy dorsal fins were very reminiscent of a certain J Pod whale. We continued to watch these very active whales continue east towards Monarch Head and wondered who they were. Turns out they were the
T109As and the T124As
. After rounding Monarch Head, they proceeded into the bay behind it (which I've rarely seen whales do). Soon they were passing by us and heading East, so we continued back towards the islands. Lots of harbor seals enjoying the full-on sunshine, as well as about 7 Stellar Sea Lions on Greenpoint.

CWR -

14:05 -
16:37
, from south to north of East Point, Saturna Island. I left the T109As, T124As, and T12A in Tumbo Channel at 1635 today. The whales were milling but seemed to be heading back west when I left them.

There was a whale tour boat watching by the
gray whale
so it didn't stay long but once the boat left it passed the opening of the bay going north and stayed across the opening looking north within our sight at
Fox Spit
for about 20 minutes. A sea lion headed south right by the spit passed by us as well! It was our first time seeing a gray whale and was amazing!

Ed and I are in
Langley
and have been watching
a gray whale
blow, moving up island. First spotted around what I think is
Bell's Beach area
, past Fox Spit? Road, now nearing what I think is towards Baby Island. Sorry going off maps and such..it's heading your way.

3:13pm -
Now the south side of the island, moving east. Seen a couple of blows.

3:00pm -
On the
Mukilteo/Clinton
run, just spotted a big whale fluke just off the west side of Hat/Gedney Island. The Clipper is there with it, was a good clue.
