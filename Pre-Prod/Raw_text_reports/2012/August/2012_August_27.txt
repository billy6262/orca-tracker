The weather was perfect: high around 70 degrees, clear blue sky, and very light breeze. We ran north - through beautifully calm water, enjoying the spectacular scenery. As we got nearer to our destination, members of
J & K Pods
showed themselves. Plenty of porpoising, a breach, a spy hop, another breach - lots of activity. We identified
K-25 (Scoter), K-27 (Deadhead), J-27 (Blackberry)
, and a host of other gorgeous
Orcas
. It's what we do. 48 47.91N, 122 46.7436W (10-12 miles north of
Lummi Island
).

We found
transients at Otter Point
foraging near shore at a kelp bed. They traveled from Secretary Island to Race Rocks doing inshore foraging within 200m. Circling each haul out they consumed 4 harbor seals. The identification of the transients was the T60s (T60, T60C, T60D, T60F, T60E). While foraging inshore 200m their respirations were some what synchronous. They did typical 30 second passes near harbor seal haul outs. The transients went offshore near Race Rocks where they killed and consumed a harbor seal. They were spotted a half mile from a mother humpback whale and calf but no interaction between the species was encountered. An example of prey handling time interval:
Dive times: 1st 4.5 minutes, 2nd 3.8 minutes, 3rd 5.1 minutes.
Dive average was 4.46 minutes.
Time from encounter to time of death, Tk= 5 minutes.
Time from death to complete consumption or abandonment, Te= 4.2 minutes.

Orca Network received a report from Shawn Henderson, who saw
a Humpback around
5:30 or 6 pm
in the Salmon Beach/
Tacoma Narrows
area as well.

5 pm -
We just saw a
very large whale
in the water south of the
Narrows
bridge between Day Island and Point Fosdick area.

I want to report a whale sighting in the
Puget Sound
area for your records. The whale was spotted about

12:15pm
on the ferry route between
Steilacoom and Anderson Island
, as well as the return at
4pm
. The whale was alone, and I believe it was a Grey whale, definitely not an Orca. We saw no unusual markings. The whale come up to the surface and quickly returned below.

Note: Considering the other reports and photos confirming a humpback, this
may have been the humpback
.
