Orca Sightings for August 14, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
While boating among the
Broughton Islands in British Columbia
, we spotted
about five Orca Whales
at approximately

12:15 pm
, just west of
Kwatzi Bay in Simoom Sound
. Kwatzi Bay is located at 50 degrees 52' N ^ 126 degree 15' W. The whales appeared to be feeding as they were circling in the same area during the time we observed them. We were traveling approximately 10 knots and they were in sight for about 15 minutes as we continued down Tribune Channel.
