Orca Sightings for August 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
During the afternoon the
J11s and J22s
were off the south end of
San Juan Island
while the rest of
J-Pod
was coming down from way up north. By

6:45 PM
the whole pod had reunited off of
Andrew's Bay
, and began making their way back south. As they came into view from
Lime Kiln around
7:45 PM
there was a lot of breaching going on in the distance, made all the more impressive by the thunder and lightning going on behind them. From

8:15-
8:45 PM the whole pod passed Lime Kiln going south. It was awesome to meet the young
J49
, who was tucked right in next to
mom J37 with aunt J40 and uncle J45
right nearby.
Grandma J14
was a bit further offshore. The clouds began to glow pink in the sunset as the whales continued south, so overall it was pretty spectacular viewing conditions! Photos at www.orcawatcher.com
