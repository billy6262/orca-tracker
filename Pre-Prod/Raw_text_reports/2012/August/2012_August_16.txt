We spent our afternoon near
Victoria
(48°25.3N, 123°09.5W) where we saw
Southern Resident Killer Whales
. At least
15 members of J-Pod
were traveling east, separated into 3 groups. In the largest group 8 individuals were porpoising in close proximity with one another. The whales were cruising at a fast clip, around 11 knots. This larger group also performed some surface displays: breaching, lobtailing, and rolling around at the surface.
