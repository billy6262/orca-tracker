Orca Sightings for August 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
. We saw many seals and a few dolphins. Much to my surprise, after leaving the Outspan Coast and hopping a BC Ferry back to the city ... Orcas! Sadly, no photos, as the camera was in the car and I was on the deck. Sighted b
etween Saltery Bay and Earls Cove
(heading south),

2:20 p.m. on

Entry 2:
5 pm -
they just cruised by
Ebey's Landing
not too far out heading south.

Attached are two pictures we took Friday afternoon in
Admiralty Inlet
. We were shrimping on
Partridge Bank
when the
large Orca appeared and soon met up with a group of about 8 more in the inlet
. We found the large male at

5:30 PM
. He met up with about 4 others and we followed them into the inlet for the next two hours where they met up with about 4 more. They put on a show for all three cruise ships! When we left they appeared to be headed for Lagoon Point.

Turnpoint Lighthouse, Stuart Island around
2:00 pm
. Some members of
J pod
porpoising and moving at a fair clip, including
Blackberry (J27)
and new calf
J49
with Mom,
Hy'Shqa (J37)
. Such a treat to see this little one alongside Mom on a calm, quiet day with few boats around. The whales changed direction a couple of times with occasional milling. Passengers on 'Mystic Sea' were thrilled with the sound of their blows, and being able to see these charismatic creatures in their natural environment.

I got to see them from
Ft. Casey
, first saw them a little north of Port Townsend, well north of the ferry terminal, then they traveled slowly across the ferry lanes towards Ft. Flagler but I would say mid-channel but more so closer to the Pt Townsend side, south side of the straits, about
4 of them
. One boat was following them...one had a nice size dorsal fin. I think I was at Ft Casey starting around

6:30 pm until 8ish
. at that point they were straight across at the Ft. Flagler side and still moving south, making it harder for me to see them.

We spotted
two groups of Orcas
traveling south through
Admiralty Inlet off of Whidbey
. The first group between
7-
7:30pm
traveling from near Ebey's south toward Lagoon Point. There were
5-7 whales in that group
. A second group just past the same direction with
4+ whales at 8-
8:30pm
. No play just commuting - coming up to breathe then traveling underwater. Such a thrill to spot!

7:41 -
Moving slowly south of
Ft Flagler
(Marrowstone Island) now, closer to that side. Sounds like Lagoon Pt or Bush Pt might be good.

7:33 -
Mid channel nearing point at
Ft Flagler
, one with a very large dorsal fin.
