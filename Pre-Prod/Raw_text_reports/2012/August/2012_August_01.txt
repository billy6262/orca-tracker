Orca Sightings for August 1, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the ferry from Bremerton to Seattle, my niece and nephew reported seeing a pod of either
4 or 5 Orca whales
in
Elliot Bay
between Bainbridge Island and West Seattle. Only their dorsal fins were visible along. It was around
1030am
and they were headed away from Seattle. My niece who is fairly familiar with marine life was pretty certain they were Orcas. I hadn't seen any other recent sightings so weren't sure if there was an actual pod in that vicinity.
