Orca Sightings for August 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
wasn't sure if they were orcas or humpbacks
- he didn't see any white, and the blows were very high and could be heard at night by the campers. One of the campers seemed to think they were humpbacks, but Al's description of the fin sounded like they may have been larger fins than what would be seen on a humpback from such a distance. There was a previous report of
4 orcas off the Quileute River the night of the 21st
, heading north, so not sure if this may have been the same 4 whales possibly patrolling the area for a few days, or if it was actually humpbacks.
