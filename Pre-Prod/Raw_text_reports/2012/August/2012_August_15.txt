Orca Sightings for August 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
A wonderfully loud symphony of
whale blows and slaps
and other assorted sounds for a long time at around
2200
in the still evening at
Eagle Point
, San Juan Island.

It was the
T36's and the T99's
at the bottom of
East Sound, Orcas Island
... They ate dinner at Yellow Island and headed towards Jones Island when we left them last night...

Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called in a report of
transients in East Sound
early in the afternoon, where they found and killed several seals over several hours. Mystic Sea posted this on their fb page "......before continuing up to East Sound, Orcas Island, where we were the very first whale watching boat on scene. Starting out with some wild splashing and tumultuous waters, we knew right away that the Transient Orcas had just made a kill. Soon after, we saw the blood in the water and could see two of the larger bulls tossing a seal back and forth (sad but nature). We identified these Transients as being the
T36 and T37
pods."

We were with
around 8 transients
yesterday near
East Sound at Orcas island
from around

4:00 to
4:45
. We think some of the transients were the
T36s
. They were definitely in hunting mode as they swam over to rocks were seals were hauled out. They hugged the rocks and it looked like they were creating waves to wash the seals off of the rocks. They also were tail/pec/dorsal fin slapping, sharking, spy hopping and breaching.

When we arrived in
East Sound
we saw
7 Transient Killer Whales
traveling south down the middle of the sound (48°37.366N, 122°52.303W). Generally Transient Killer Whales travel in small groups, 3-5 individuals, and are stealthy and elusive as they are hunting marine mammals. However, this pod was very surface active: spyhopping, lobtailing, cartwheeling and rolling around at the surface. We were all excited to witness the variety of behaviors and had excellent views as the whales changed direction and surprised us by cruising against the shore.

I was looking out from Beachyhead in
East Sooke
park (15-20 miles west of Victoria) today and saw
two humpbacks
. From

3:00PM to
5:00PM
the two humpback stayed close together, about 5 miles directly off shore. For two hours they would disappear for six minutes then surface a few times, then disappear again. With the exception of a few passing freighters there were no boats with them. The two were last seen going east.

Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters reported seeing
2 or 3 minkes on MacArthur bank, just off Iceberg Point, Lopez Island
, rolling on their backs and breaching, highly unusual behaviors for minkes.
*
We cruised to
Salmon Bank
to look for the Minke Whales. We only had to wait a few minutes before a
Minke Whale
surfaced 200 yards from the boat! At that same time the Captain received a call on the radio that Orca Whales had been seen in East Sound. It was clear the word had spread as the handful of boats viewing the Minke Whale all turned and headed north.
