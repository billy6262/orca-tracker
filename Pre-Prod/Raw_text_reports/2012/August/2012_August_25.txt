My last report was 7 years ago from
North Pender Island
. Today a big thrill spotting
5 T's at
12:30 pm
hunting a seal off Downes Point (SE corner of Hornby Island). Tracked them eastwards still circling their prey to the northeast side of outer Tribune Bay. Big ones and a teenager making up the pod. The big one did not come across as a male with no strong vertical dorsal - just not sure. They continued circling and chasing down their prey below our cliifside vantage point. After a while they headed southeast towards Flora Islet at the east tip of Helliwell Provincial Park before heading south into the Strait of Georgia (towards Lasqueti Island?).

had been observed 1/2 - 1 mile off Sand Point, on the north coast on Tuesday & Wednesday,
