We were out today with Mackay Whale Watching and saw members of the
I15s (Northern Residents)
. They were heading East in
Johnstone Strait
. The young male
I77
(15 years old) surprised us two times and surfaced right in front of us.
I65
and her kids
I103 and I122
were resting, then starting to play. They made a tail slap and a spyhop. It was awesome!

1:30 pm - Minke whale
and youngster near
Lime Kiln, San Juan
, traveling steadily south. We were lucky to see some lunge feeding and a beautiful, tapered head breaking through today's calm, glassy waters. Several harbor porpoise nearby 'shared the water', while several growling Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks shared the air.
