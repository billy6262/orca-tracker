I finally got to see the new little one today! We spent our whole trip with
J37, J49 and J45
along the
Pender Bluffs
. It was great to see him/her.

We caught up with at least
12 members of J-Pod
today near
Boundary Pass
(48°43.03N, 123°16.14W). The whales were traveling in small groups headed north along the southern end of South Pender and North Pender Islands. In the first group
"Princess Angeline" (J17)
was traveling with her daughter
"Polaris" (J28)
and granddaughter
"Star" (J46)
along with several other whales. The whales were traveling and surfacing in close proximity with one another.
"Blackberry" (J27)
, a mature male, was also traveling with this group. After spending some time with these whales we had reports of other members of J-Pod further north. In the second group we saw
"Mike" (J26)
, a mature male, traveling with his mother
"Slick" (J16)
and sister
"Echo" (J42)
born in 2007. At least four other whales were also seen surfacing near shore. So great to spend time with J-Pod!
