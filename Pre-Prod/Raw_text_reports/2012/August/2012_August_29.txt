Orca Sightings for August 29, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another amazing day out on the ocean.
Transient killer whales
were again sighted and turned out to be the
T60 group
. They were spotted less than a mile from
a Humback whale
which they left alone. They then made their way West in the
middle of Juan De Fuca Strait
and swam past
a minke whale
and
a school of harbor porpoise
. Soon they locked onto
a Dall's porpoise
and the lead female T60 began breaching at full speed at the swift little porpoise. The rest of the pod seemed to not know how to handle the foraging behavior. This may be due to inexperience because of the younger whales in this group. The Dall's porpoise fled the female orca and the hunt was stopped. It seemed the mother was giving a hunting demonstration to her offspring.

California - Pt. Sur
Clipper was on the whales before we were, and I guess there was a male with this group [of
orcas
] before but we didn't get a chance to see him. We caught up with the group at about

12:15
at 48/00 and stayed with them until
1pm
. They were moving NW at about 5 knots and then did a 180 and started to chase something... we could see the tips of their dorsal fins zipping under the surface and two of them porpoised completely out of the water. We didn't get a look at what they caught, but they quickly moved on afterwards to the NW. We ended up at 49/02 before going home.

At

5:30 PM
I was fishing from my boat on my buoy and was startled by a very loud blow and turned to see a
Humpback
surface about 300ft from me. I live about in the middle of
Mutiny Bay
. It then surfaced about 10-12 more times as it was heading
toward Bush Point
. There was a small inflatable following it for about 4-5 miles. Pretty sweet evening!

Spotted a single
whale
in
Admiralty Inlet
, immediately east of
Eglon Wa
. Swimming north towards point no point at

3:15p.m
. Possibly a
humpback
. Seemed too small for a Gray.

Just missed the pic but what a close encounter we just had with
humpback
. Fluked right next to our boat at 1500 heading north about
2 miles north of Kingston
quarter mile from shore. Very cool finish to our sail today :)

3:30 PM -
The Three Minketeers:
3 Minke Whales
out in
Haro Strait
, just south of Salmon Bank and San Juan Island (48°24.97N 122°59.02). Doing their Minke thing, traveling from bait ball to bait ball and lunging after any food in their course.
