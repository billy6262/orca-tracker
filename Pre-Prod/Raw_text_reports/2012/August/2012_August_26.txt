Orca Sightings for August 26, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Type of whale seen:
humpback
whale (field marks used to confirm ID: triangular dorsal fin with rounded tip and hump in front; easily visible blow that extended up to 2 m from the surface and was conical (v-shaped); the blow was clearly visible from at least 1.5 km; flukes with uneven trailing edge and white along the trailing edge; each time it sounded, it fluked.
Number of animals seen: 1
47deg 20' 13 sec N, 122deg 45' 43 sec W (between Dash Point State Park and Vashon Island in the middle of the channel)
Direction of travel: South (towards Commencement Bay)
What was the whale doing: Traveling and possibly feeding. It sounded on multiple occasions and fluked at least twice. We initially observed the whale from our sea kayaks. We were approximately 500m offshore of
Dash Point State Park
when we heard the blow behind us (farther out in the channel). The whale was SW of our position by about 400-500m. It continued swimming down the channel to the south. I am a seabird ecologist and conservation biologist and have spent considerable time at sea conducting seabird and marine mammal surveys. I am confident that the animal we observed was a humpback. A colleague of mine, Dr. Kristin Laidre of UW, who is a marine mammal ecologist and whale expert saw the whale from shore and also confirmed that it was a
humpback
.

I am just wanting to know if the whale many of us saw close to
Lincoln Park
was a humpback or a gray. In researching and looking at photos, to me it seemed most like a humpback but I didn't think that was possible this time of year in this location. Wondering if there were any reports from yesterday Sunday the 26th of any humpbacks in sound near Seattle? It did several blows, and dived. We saw it dive twice and each time its fluke/tail came fully out of the water. It was dark gray without a visible dorsal fin, or a very small one, and looked like that classic humpback angle on the back. It came up right in front of two standing paddle surfers (the kind who stand and paddle on boards). Very big, very exciting.

Note: From the photos above it was a
humpback

Encounter # 55-1 and 55-2 -
J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait
. The encounter began at

8:22 am
when we found
J2
passing San Juan County Park. Trailing behind her were the
K12's and K13's
. The whales were spread out in loose groups travelling north in Haro Strait. In the distance off Bellevue Point, several large groups of whales worked their way up the strait as their exhales got closer and closer. More on the this encounter and incredible photos at the link above.

, heading south.

Eric Strachan observed a pod of
9 - 12 orcas
between

6:30 - 7 am
this morning while he was fishing from the old concrete dock on the
Fox Island pier
(SE Fox Island, south of the Tacoma Narrows) - the orcas were mid-channel.
*
We observed between
10-15 members of L pod
that were spread out south of
False Bay
and heading to the southeast (48°25.25N, 123°05.87W). Five to six orcas were surfacing in a tight-knit group. Three other individuals were at least 500 yards away to the south and east, but traveling in the same direction. One orca breached twice; what an incredible splash! We believe we spotted the
L85 "Mystery"
in the group, and two-year-old L116 with mother L82 "Kasatka".

This morning I got to Land Bank on the
west side of San Juan Island
at

8:20 AM
, just as the last group of the
superpod
whales were heading north. In this group were at least:
J16, J26, J27, L83, L110, L47, L115, L72, L92, L105, L95, L26, L90, and L91
. I went up to
San Juan County Park
then, where large groups of active whales continued to head north between
9 and
9:30
a little ways offshore. Later, with word the whales had turned back south, I went back out to Lime Kiln Point State Park where
K21, K16, and K36
passed by heading south at
11 AM
. They were followed by the
rest of K-Pod at
11:40
. As Ks continued south (towards the L12 sub-group who remained off the south end all day), another large group of whales was visible several miles to the north and offshore, presumably
J-Pod and the rest of L-Pod
. They were heading southwest, angling towards Discovery Island.
