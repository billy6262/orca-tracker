I was traveling on the
4pm
Swartz Bay to Tsawwassen Ferry. Just after coming out of
Active Pass
there were approximately
5 whales
heading north up the Strait of Georgia. They just seemed to be transiting and they all looked like adults. When a smaller ferry passed they did slap their tails a few times when surfacing.

Today we met up with
7-8 members of J-Pod
on the southwest side of
Mayne Island
(Canada) headed north for Active Pass (48°50.93'N, 123°20.55'W). They were resting, traveling in a tight-knit group, surfacing in unison for a few breaths, and then taking deep dives for a few moments. In this group we identified
Blackberry (J27), Doublestuf (J34), and Princess Angeline (J17)
. We left them headed north around

3:30 PM
