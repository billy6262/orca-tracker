Orca Sightings for July 25, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mecea called at
5 pm
to say about
50 (fifty) orcas are headed east in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
, past Muir Point.

Near
Salmon Bank
, just south of San Juan Island, our Captain spotted a
Minke Whale
(48°25.10N, 122°58.03W)! Minke Whales are a baleen whale and approximately 30 feet in length. Salmon Bank is a very productive area and the Minke Whale was busy foraging. The whale seemed to be listening for bird activity at the surface indicating a bait ball of fish had formed. The whale would then come up from below and engulf the bait ball, scaring all the birds into flight. A very efficient foraging strategy; who wouldn't want their own sous chef.
