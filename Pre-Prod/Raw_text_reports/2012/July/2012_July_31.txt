Entry 1:

Off the south end of San Juan Island, around
Salmon Bank
(48 24.977'N 122 57.291' W), we came across at least
three or four minke whales
. Two of which were traveling right next to each other! Baleen whales typically travel individually in feeding grounds, so seeing two, thirty foot whales surface one after the other, multiple times was quite a sight!
