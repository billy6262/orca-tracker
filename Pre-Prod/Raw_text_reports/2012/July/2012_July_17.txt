Orca Sightings for July 17, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we traveled through Cattle Pass, we headed west and observed members of
J-pod
, particularly two males,
J-27 "Blackberry" and J-39 "Mako".
These two were foraging and feeding near
False Bay
(48°28.679N, 123°06.621W). We also spotted
a minke whale
south of where the orcas were foraging. The minke had a few slow surfaces and then went for a deep dive.
