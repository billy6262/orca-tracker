Orca Sightings for July 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient killer whales T60
were off
Sooke BC
. We found them at Secretary rock haulout foraging. They circled secretary rock and church rock. They made 2 kills, both of harbor seals. They carried one seal for about a mile. We left them at race rock passage. Average dive time was 1.37 minutes. longest dive times lasted 4-5 minutes.

In the morning
J and K pod
whales were reported coming down
Boundary Pass
, but just north of Henry Island they turned around and headed back north, up
Swanson Channel
toward Active Pass. That afternoon Susan and I joined Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research to find them, which took us all the way to
Active Pass
. At about

2:30
we suddenly found ourselves surrounded by
J and K pod orcas
, who seemed to saying goodbye as they parted ways for a while.
