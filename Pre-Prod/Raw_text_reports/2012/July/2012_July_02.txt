Orca Sightings for July 2, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were fishing off the Olympic peninsula and saw
three Orca whales
, two adults and a juvenile. The photos are not great but maybe they can be of some use. We saw the flyers asking for information about killer whale sightings at the La Push marina. Hope this information is useful.
Time:

2:30
(approx.)
Location:
Needles by Second Beach
, not far from La Push marina, Washington

Southern Resident Killer Whales
today! Caught up with about 7 slowly foraging members of
J-Pod
, including Granny (J-2), Blackberry (J-27) along with Onyx (L-87) on the west side of San Juan Island at 48.27.388N 123.03.597W. We stayed with them until peeling away at the light house at
Lime Kiln
to complete a circumnavigation of San Juan Island. Caught a quick sighting of
2 Dall's Porpoises
close to Kelp Reef too.

Crazy day today!
6 Orca at Stanley Park in Vancouver
!! I made a 180 turn and just over an hour later we found
T49B, T49B1, T49B2, T49A, T49A1 and T51
. I have never seen them so close to the city! News cameras all over, they made a kill right along the shoreline of Jericho beach and a couple spyhops after. No sign of T49A's other two calves A2 and A3 so that doesn't look too good. It was an awesome show and our passengers were blown away....so was I!

Okay, photos are pretty fuzzy and distant, but it does look like
two Risso's dolphins
, definitely smaller than a minke, and tallish falcate dorsal fin like a Risso's. I don't think we can say 100%, but 95% sure. Really hard to imagine what else they could be.

Entry 2:
About

7:30am
, I saw the two whales again. I live on
Puget Sound on Sunrise Beach Rd NW (Steamboat area) across from Sunset Beach on the Cooper area
. The water this morning is very calm. I heard the whales. They were traveling together south towards
Mudd Bay
. The whales are dark grey and smooth. Their dorsal fin is slightly curved towards their tail. I haven't seen their head or tail. I don't see any spots on their back. It's
9:00am now, and they have been swimming around Sunset beach for about an hour.
