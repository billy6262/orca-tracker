Orca Sightings for July 18, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:30-
2:30pm -
A pod of
Orcas in Desolation sound (upper Georgia Strait)
, passing by the falls in Teakern Arm then along the north shore of the arm before heading north along the Redonda west coast. We were with them for almost an hour, with them swimming toward us, then along with us. Many spy hops, breaches and twirls. It was truly an amazing gift for my 70th birthday. We also heard from several folks on Cortes that the pod or another were seen heading north past Cortes Bay , then past Seaford earlier in the day.

Not long after passing
boundary pass
we saw one dorsal fin, then another, then three more! There were about eight to ten southern resident killer whales, traveling close to each other. They were moving north along Pender Island (48 36.54'N 123 04.94'W). We watched as three whales spy-hopped, one after another, followed by a full, body out of the water, breach! The whales then moved close to shore, slowly diving and surfacing. In this group naturalist Jenny and I were able to identify members from both
J and L pods
, including
L-72 Racer, J-27 Blackberry, J-28 Polaris, L-25 Ocean Sun
.
