Orca Sightings for July 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the west side of
San Juan Island
, we came across
at least seven killer whales
. Both members of
J and L pod
were around. We identified
L-86 "Onyx," J-16 "Slick," and L-92 "Crewser."
The whales were milling about, not in a hurry to go one direction or the other. We had amazing views of their white saddle and eye patches, especially when one orca spy hopped, bringing its head out of the water!
