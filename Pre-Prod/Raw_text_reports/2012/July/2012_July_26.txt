We traveled west near
Eagle Point
, San Juan Island (48째26.7577N, 123째00.5170W) when a large dorsal fin appeared belonging to
J27 "Blackberry"
. Two other males were nearby,
J26 "Mike" and J34 "Doublestuff"
. These members of J-pod were actively hunting, circling through the water. We saw slapping of pectoral fins and flukes and could hear the splashes.
J35 "Tahlequah"
and her male calf
J47 "Notch"
were also foraging for food. It was incredible to see the orcas surface in synchronization and hear their exhalations.
