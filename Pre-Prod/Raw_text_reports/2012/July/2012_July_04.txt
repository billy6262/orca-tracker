Orca Sightings for July 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the
evening
we were out on a friend's boat sailing between
Lagoon Point and Marrow Stone Island (south Puget Sound)
. On several occasions we saw "blackfish," two mammals, which were surfacing 3 to 4 times then diving. They were completely black on the parts we could see, and the dorsum was tightly curved. It was so quiet out there, hardly any other boats, that we could hear them breathing. There were lots of birds out there as well so it was probably feeding time.

These sound like the two Risso's dolphins that have been seen in south Puget Sound, although they haven't been seen for a while, so we can't be certain.

9:58 pm - Whales
just passed
Eagle Cove
heading south close to shore. We could hear them echo-locating from shore. Such a beautiful sound!

I spotted some
orcas
swimming off of
Rosario
off southwest Fidalgo, west of Deception Pass, this morning at

8:30 AM
. I heard some breaths and looked up to see a few orca passing and one large male dorsal fin in the distance. They heading south, southwest. The male (very large) seemed to be heading westward. I think I caught the tail end of a group so can only say I definitely saw about 4. The others were behind Rosario Headland.

Members of
J- and L-pods
were observed traveling north along the west side of San Juan Island near
Lime Kiln Point State Park
(48째30.3261N, 123째10.8999W). L87 "Onyx" was exhibiting foraging behavior, surfacing quickly and changing direction frequently. We also saw J28 "Polaris" traveling with a young whale. While watching the Southern Resident Killer Whales a
Humpback Whale surfaced near Small Pox Bay
also traveling north. The Humpback Whale would take a few breaths of air before diving for several minutes. We last saw the Humpback Whale perform a fluke-up dive just south of Mitchell Bay (48째34.0625N, 123째11.0407W).
