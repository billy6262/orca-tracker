Orca Sightings for July 14, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Last Saturday, approx.
4pm
, my wife and I were looking for whales around the
Salmon bank
area, between cattle point light house and the outer salmon bank buoy. We observed the whale watching group 3 to 4 miles north west and thought we had missed the orcas. The sea state was very lumpy, 3 to 5 foot swells. My wife spotted a fast moving fin and did not know what it was, due to the sea state. All of a sudden
the whale
was right next to our boat moving faster than I have ever observed a whale to move. Our boat is 16 ft wide by 55 ft long. By now we are dead in the water with the engine off. The whale looked like a sub, it was so wide and fast . We saw the whale several more times by watching the feeding birds move out of the whales way. The fin was very distinct, we finally found the fin match on the computer and
totally agree it was a fin whale
