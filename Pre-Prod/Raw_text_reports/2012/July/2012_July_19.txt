============================================================

Entry 1:
A pod of about
8 orcas
was off of
Washington Park
(south of Anacortes) this morning at

10:00
. Others at the park reported another pod on the other side of the park.

K Pod
finally returned today! It was great to see them back.
J's and L's
shared my enthusiasm...what an awesome day! Whales as far as the eye could see...extremely loud vocals, touching, rubbing, breaching...the whole nine. One of my favorite days I've ever had. It was so amazing to watch the interaction between all of them.

We reached the whales at 48° 36.73'N 122° 44.88'W (
northern Rosario Strait, between Cypress and Orcas islands
). At first we spotted a large group of probably ten or more killer whales, but as we looked around, there were
several large groups
. Dorsal fins were slicing through the water's surface everywhere! Big ones, small ones, sizes in between! We were witnessing a super pod;
members from J, K, and L pods were present, at least twenty, if not thirty whales
. We watched as the whales spread out horizontally and started swimming towards each other. The whales then split again into two groups. Both groups were active. You name the behavior, we saw it. They were spy hopping, lob tailing, pectoral slapping, cartwheeling, back diving, and yes, BREACHING! One small whale breached six or seven times in a row! Additionally, we heard their vocalizations both above water and underwater via the hydrophone, as well as their distinctive blows from either side of our boat. All this activity in tight groups made it difficult to identify individuals (honestly, there was so much to watch I forgot about trying to figure out who we were seeing), but we were able to ID the super distinctive 35 year old male
L-41, Mega, as well as L74, Saanich
.

11:00 am -
Went out on the chartered Western Prince with documentary crew, headed for Rosario Strait and found
J and K pod north of Lummi Island
. Not much luck with IDs but there were many passes as they moved SW toward Orcas Island and down Rosario.
