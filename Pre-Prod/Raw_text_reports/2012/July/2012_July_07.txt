Orca Sightings for July 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just before sunset, approx
4 (poss 5) orcas
spotted feeding just off shore, between Mt Gardner dock and bluewater (
Bowen island
north of Vancouver) in Collingwood Channel between Bowen and Keats islands. Played happily until a boat came too close then they disappeared to be seen some time later frollicking off shore of the south point of hutt island.

We saw our first, large Orca dorsal fin slice through the water at 48ยบ52.88'N 122ยบ56.61'W. It was
L-87 "Onyx."
We thought he might be alone, but there were two females, J-2 "Granny" swimming along with J-8 "Spieden" not too far behind him. Everyone was super excited not only to see the 101 year old matriarch of the southern resident killer whales, but also to see the difference between the tall, triangular dorsal fin of the adult male killer whale compared to the smaller, lunate shaped dorsal fins of the females. And while all this was going on, Mt. Baker was the backdrop, giving the opportunity for amazing pictures.

After a few days of hauling down to the San Juans, we finally got the
J22's, J27 and the L72's
up near us in
Active Pass
and into the Strait of Georgia. As they normally do, they showed off coming out of the pass with breaches and tail slaps...it was impressive. Great show from the whales, not to mention flat seas and the sun shining! Great day!
