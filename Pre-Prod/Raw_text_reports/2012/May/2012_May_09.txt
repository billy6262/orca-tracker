Entry 1:
John Ford relayed a report of about
8 Bigg's killer whales near Nanaimo around 3 pm
. Graeme Ellis got out to document them as they were feasting on something, but seas were too heavy to tell what it was.

We found the whales 1.5 miles offshore from
Lime Kiln Point
(48°32.49'N, 123°10.71'W). The whales were members of
J-Pod
. They were spread out, and cruising along the coast headed south. A member of the
L-Pod, L87 "Onyx"
, was also seen among the J's. Unfortunately the seas were deteriorating and the whales were headed into rougher waters, unusual for San Juan Islands, so we turned around and headed back to more sheltered waters.
