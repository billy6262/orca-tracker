, the occasional call of a single orca on Line Kiln from 0255. This was right after the tanker Alqadisia passed South. Recorded some of it using Audacity. I assume they/it were resting??

William White called about 4-6 orca off the northeast side of
Patos Island
(northernmost island of the San Juan Islands), at

1:15 pm
today, heading north about 500-1,000 feet from shore. He saw one male, 3-4 females and one juvenile.
*
We spotted a large group of
six to seven transient killer whales
identified as
T18s
just outside of
Friday Harbor
. The transients were more active than usual, tail slapping, rolling around, and spy hopping. As we were heading back through Spieden Channel, we came across the transient killer whales again! This time a huge male joined the group, with a dorsal fin at least five feet tall. It was a spectacular site and perfect ending to an amazing day.
