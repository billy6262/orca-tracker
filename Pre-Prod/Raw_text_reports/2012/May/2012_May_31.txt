T65A and T65A4, her new calf, off Discovery Island
. Lots of breaching and playing, a harbor seal kill and mostly playful whales. T65A just sat there rostrum pointed towards me and watched me for 5 minutes. It was weird behavior. Russ Nicks was with me as well.

All of our best guesses were that the residents had gone out to the ocean Wednesday evening. I was happy to hear of some
Transient Orcas near Victoria
and figured that was where I was headed on our

12:00
sailing. However...at
11:30 I got a call that there were
Residents near Lime Kiln
! Oh yes! I called our naturalist, Jeanne Hyde, who wasn't going to be with us that morning. She was totally surprised since she had not heard any vocalizations on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. She came running and off we went! We spotted Orcas off of Lime Kiln in about 15 minutes, out in the fog.
All of J Pod, most of the Ks and old L87
, now a J Pod member! It was a most unusual day. They were very quiet on our first trip, doing a lot of milling. We came out again at
3:00 and they went back to their usual behavior, with a lot of breaching and playing around.

Whales were spotted passing
Lime Kiln lighthouse at about
11:15 a.m.
On Maya's Westside Charters a short while later we located
J and K pods and L-87
in a tight group heading for Discovery Island. It was an unusual encounter as the whales stopped for several minutes, bunched up, at first all aiming the same direction. Then some changed their position facing the other direction. After almost 5 minutes of this they all went under. The next whale to surface was
Granny J-2
who appeared to be leading the way. They zigged and zagged up Haro Strait all afternoon. Late in the day we left them at Turn Pt. looking like they were heading up Swanson Channel. Pictures and more of the encounters of the day are posted on my blog: Whale of A Purpose

A report of Transients off
Lime Kiln
that ended up being
J's and K's
!! It was a little foggy and overcast as they slowly headed north in a resting pattern. The combination of all the whales surfacing at the same time and the weather made for a really cool setting and a very relaxing show.

WOW what an amazing day on the water with
J Pod and K Pod
!! They were all grouped up resting for most of the day. So spectacular to see over 48 Orcas all grouped up with a few spyhops to check us out!

Transients:
T30, T30A, T30B, her calf T30B1
(which was first seen
April 5th) and
T30C
were traveling west in
Spieden Channel at
6:15 p.m
. They were closer to the shoreline along Spiden Island.

A group of around
20 orcas
, well spread out, passed by
Thieves Bay, Pender Island between 6.15 and 6.45pm
. We just caught the tail end as the last three passed.

My boyfriend and I were out on the water today, and this afternoon at
1530 off of Tounge Point (Crescent Bay) On the Straits Of Juan De Fuca
.. Lat/Lon: 48.18°N 123.71°W . West of
Port Angeles
. There was
a single female Orca Heading out west
. She was doing a cruzing speed and would surface 2 times then disappear for about 8-10 minutes surface 2 more times then she was gone for a good 10 or more minutes. We heard her blow about a mile away but never saw her again.. Strange to see a female Orca out on her own. Wish I could have gotten a pic or 2 of her.

Ron Pool called with a report of seeing a
n orca about a mile offshore, about 1 - 2 pm, about a mile north of Crescent City CA
(by the green can). He saw the poster with the number to call.
*
I am not sure if these are the same killer whales that were sighted off
Quileute
last night, but we saw about
4-5 killer whales
on the East side of
Carroll Island
headed South at around

6:30 PM
.

5 orcas off Quileute today at 2103
, heading south. Coordinates were 47.53.9 x 124.39.1. No photos.
