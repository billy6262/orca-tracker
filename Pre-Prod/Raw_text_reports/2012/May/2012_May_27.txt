Orca Sightings for May 27, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Billy Wood called to report that on
May 27 at
4 pm, he saw 3 killer whales within feet of the rocks on the north side of Cape Blanco, OR
, 7 miles north of Port Orford. He said one looked like an adult male. He said he saw the poster with the sightings number at a fish and chips stand.

I was out today scouting for transient killer whales west of Sooke with Russ Nicks..... unfortunately no transients we did pick up a large older
gray whale feeding
. I wonder what encounters she has had with transients in her migrations from the South.
