8:13 pm - Orca
alert...heading north in
Saratoga Passage...about 6 total
, traveling in pairs...just north of C
amano Island Inn (about even with Coupeville)
. They are not moving north very fast...so awesome! They have stayed in relatively the same spot for about 30 minutes so far...they appear to be diving down and traveling north and then turning around and coming back a little...very fun to watch! My 9 year old son wants me to share that they were breaching and jumping up :)....they are now slowly moving north...

At approximately
1100
today (23
May 2012), a US Navy small boat conducting operations in and around Gardner Bay spotted
two separate pods of orcas
. Our approximate position was 1 nautical mile
southeast of Gedney Island
.
One pod had 5-6 members
and was traveling southwesterly, in the direction of Mukilteo.
The second pod had approximately 2-4 members
. They were 1 mile southwest of us (therefore, approximately two miles directly south of Gedney Island). We were too distant from them to determine specific numbers or direction of movement. The nature of their activity seemed to be transit.
