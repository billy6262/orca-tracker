Orca Sightings for May 19, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient orcas
located today in the more northerly portions of Georgia Strait. We found
T10
with her sons
T10B and T10C, plus T26
with her daughter
T26A
northwest of Winchelsea Island, heading west. They continued in this direction until we left them at approximately 2 PM northwest of the Ballenas Islands. For those unfamiliar with this part of Georgia Strait, we were northwest of Nanaimo. Nice to have some orcas around again.

Located
4 transients off Mistaken Island
, near Parksville, about 20 miles northwest of
Nanaimo
. They were traveling north, and included in the group was
T26 and T26A
. They were with the
T10s, T10B and T10C
. Shortly after we left the scene, the four were joined by at least 9 other transients. Wow, what are they up to?? They were taking 2 minute dives, and swimming just under the surface, as we could see the their white eye patches and flank patches flashing just under the waves. They were making a slow and steady pace north, and were not exhibiting the "super stealth" mode of hunting transients.
