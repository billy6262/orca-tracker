"Spouting News" - BIRDSEYE VIEW OF ORCA POD - Around
7PM
this evening, on the
6:45PM Kennewick ferry from
Port Townsend to Coupeville
; we were treated to
ORCAS
!! Lots of them, spread out over a mile; maybe, up to 2 miles. Resident or transient pod??? Difficult, to guess how many, 15? More? Viewing them/looking down from the ferry "top deck" was also a neat experience. Lots of tail/fluke splashes as quite a number of orcas got into the act. Contagious? Spouts, tall dorsal fins out on display, along, with some frolicking. Also, the "top deck" provided a birdseye view. Seeing lots of white on their sides/underbellies; when several surfaced close-by. Orcas are magnificent. I grew in my appreciation for them immensely this evening/watching them do their thing. As the Kennewick continued east to Whidbey Island, the orcas were heading south towards Marrowstone Island to get ready for the sunset.

From
Lagoon Point
, watching some
J pod and K pod orcas
, and
maybe the L2's
if it's the same group that was up on the San Juans yesterday, probably about 30-35 whales in all. At

6:45 pm
they were way spread far apart, from mid channel off
Pt. Wilson to many miles south of Port Townsend
, a good eight to ten miles apart, all within our view from 8-10 miles away at about 250 feet elevation. We were seeing blows, dorsals, taillobs and a spyhop, all backlit by the setting sun, for over an hour. Almost always one or another group was at the surface doing something. Then a few minutes after 8 pm they just disappeared. We watched for about 55 minutes afterward and never saw another sign of an orca until dark. This was an amazing disappearing act. So we don't know which way they went.

A terrific sighting of
orcas
today off North Beach,
Port Townsend
around

6:10pm
coming down the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Rounding Point Wilson, at the light house of Fort Worden and continuing down the strait. Being a whale novice, there seemed to be numerous pods probably about 40 orcas in total. One breached, numerous tail slaps and another coming vertical out of the water showing it's head. As a new resident of the PNW this was an honor to see, as my first ever Orca sighting.

The sun was shining high in the sky as we left Friday Harbor this afternoon. We headed south, far south, enjoying the natural beauty of the islands along the way. At 48o 10.80'N 122 o 59.70'W, off shore between
Dungeness Spit and Port Angeles
, we spotted our first blow. It was the
Southern Resident killer whales
. The Orcas were spread out all around us. We watched as they milled around in groups of two to four individuals, diving and blowing, their dorsal fins cutting through the water. What a sight! After spending some time with the whales it was time to make the long journey back. But time did not stop us from viewing two bald eagles on Long Island, a group of Steller sea lions on whale rocks, and gulls and cormorants on Goose Island. We couldn't have asked for a better day!

8am
Saturday morning - About
10 orcas
, spread out, traveled east to west along the south end of
Lopez
. They provided a distraction to those bouncing up and down in their boats while waiting for shrimp traps to fill. One small boat motored right through where several orcas were - either oblivious to them or not caring about them. Orcas were bigger than some of the boats.

orcas 1.5 miles off Sekiu

12 noon
. He saw about 6, including 2 males.
