Orca Sightings for May 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
J2 crew
were around
Point Roberts
, making their way toward Sand Heads, foraging foraging foraging. There may have been others there, but I only managed to ID
J8, L87, J14, J37, J40, and J45
... they were really spread out.

We spotted the first dorsal fin at
Robert's Bank
, immediately followed by another. We followed the first two whales for about 15 minutes and had to start heading back, but just as the boat gained speed we spotted another two. Then we started seeing several more orcas, both off in the distance, and as close as 200 yards away. The passengers and crew grew very excited and it seemed as though the Residents fed off our excitement. A young calf started breaching, followed by an older member of the pod lobtailing, and another spy hopping. It was an amazing site to see! We then continued to travel with the
Residents
for a significant amount of time as we made our way back home.

8am - about 6 orcas
coming past south end of
Lopez
, going east to west, far out, some tail lobs and other splashing.

Humpback whale BCX1057
crossed paths with the
southern residents west of Dungeness light
as she headed east. She returned last season with a calf. An ongoing catalogue of humpback whales of the Salish Sea is available online through the Centre for Whale Research.

1:50 pm - Minke or humpback
. Stasha Decker called from just
south of Whidbey NAS
(northwest Whidbey Island) to say she's watching a large black whale moving south and lifting its flukes.
Fluking indicates a humpback

I have to say I think it was a Minke Whale due to the distinct fin I saw as the whale rolled across the surface. It looked like the Whale Boat out of Anacortes was following it North to South, about a hundred yards off the shore along the Naval Air Station today, at just about noon. Looked like he/she was alone?
