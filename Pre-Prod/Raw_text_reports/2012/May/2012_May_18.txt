Orca Sightings for May 18, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
My boyfriend and I spotted
orcas from the Spouting Horn at Cape Perpetua (20 miles south of Newport OR)
. We saw two, and there were two other people nearby who also saw them. They seemed to be traveling out to sea. We saw the orcas at around

12:30 pm
. Earlier in the same day we had seen
two gray whales
from the visitor's center at Cape Perpetua the people working there said they were a mother and a baby, and they seemed to be traveling north. That was probably around

11:00 am.

WOW... We had an epic day on the water yesterday! We traveled over 110 nautical miles or 200 km to see a
group of transients
. When we first arrived with the transient orcas off Parksville, we sighted 5 transients the
T10's and the T26's
. After spending time with them we saw more transient orcas appear in the distance. Then more and more appeared from almost every direction. We ended up with at least 17 transients socializing and having a big party. It was a truly amazing day!!! Here are the transients I managed to i.d.-
T10's, T87, T26's, T90's, T86A's, T100's
