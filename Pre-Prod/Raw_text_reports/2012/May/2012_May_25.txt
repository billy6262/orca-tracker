After a day with no Orcas, I had a hunch! Heading south to Victoria about an hour in our trip we go the word from a buddy on a boat out of Victoria.
Transient Orcas
, about 4 miles south of where we were. Lovely! Orcas again in the afternoon. We left them headed west at at

4:00 PM
.

Transient Orcas
T36 A's and B's, T37, and the T99's
- with Nan Yates Simpson at near
Victoria
, B.C. Nothing got munched, but they were being SUPER playful! So much rolly-polly surface action (including LOADS of spyhops) I was beginning to think we were watching residents.

Today we caught up with a group of
4 Transient Orcas off the southwestern end of Victoria
; coordinates 48°22.0'N, 123°25.0'W. This group was not as stealthy as we typically see with Transients. They were surfacing multiple times, almost in a predictable manner, and were lobtailling often with a couple spyhops here and there. This group was also quite young; two younger calves and two adults who appeared to be in their 20s. We got to travel with them for about 20 minutes or so until we headed back for San Juan Island.

12:40 pm:
Stephanie Raymond reports: Just heard from Victoria Clipper that there is a group of
9 or so orcas eastbound at Constance Bank
(south of Victoria).

A report was sent to Orca Network from onboard a commercial fishing vessel
~40 mi SW of Cape Flattery about ~40 orcas in tight groups heading S-SW
. They were too far away for any ID photos.
Initial sighting was made at
5:00am
. I saw a few females with open right saddles, but couldn't make any positive IDs. They were in the same vicinity as
two humpbacks
. The whales stayed with us for about 2 hours, and a female with a calf made a close pass across our bow. I only got one look with no photo confirmation, but I'm about 90% sure it was
J16 with J42
. The only other similar looking saddle at that distance is K20, but I don't think it was her based on the dorsal shape.
