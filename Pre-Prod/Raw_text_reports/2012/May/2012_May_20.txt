Faint
calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones now (

Finally, after what has seemed like an eternity,
ORCAS
!
J Pod returned late this afternoon
. We left them this evening just south of Victoria at

6:30
headed toward San Juan Island. They were energetic, fat and sassy... It was an hour filled with all sorts of playing and horsing around.

Ron Bates, MMRG, received a report at approximately
12.10pm
from Russ Nicks, that 4
Transient Orcas were near Sooke
, heading East. We immediately contacted the next boat leaving Victoria and sent it west to investigate and they did encounter the
T's near Beecher Bay
moving East. When we set out on our
2pm
tour we heard the T's had turned West and were near Secretary. Just as we arrived on scene one of the other boats thought they saw more blows closer to shore and when we investigated we
discovered it was J-pod
moving East towards Race Rocks! Finally, J-pod had returned to the Salish Sea after almost 2 weeks out at sea!

Just thought I'd let you know that the Transients seen near Beecher Bay, then
off Sooke
were the
T137s
. We caught up with them on Goldwing around
3:30 and had a great encounter.
T137A
(a big boy for 10 years old!) and
T137B were traveling together, and T137
and her youngest calf were not far away. Lots of socializing and play, mostly instigated by the little one!

Several
orcas
spotted this
afternoon about 2pm
traveling south just off
Magnolia
. They actually
went into Elliot Bay
and after about 45 minutes headed out towards
Blake Island
. One of the Argosy Tour boats also enjoyed the show. There were two large orcas and possibly up to 5 smaller ones.

Myself and Ron King picked up
6 or 7 transient killer whales
a mile and a half off
race rocks light house
. They were breaching and lots of spyhops as well as high speed porpoising. We found them making a kill on a group of harbor porpoise. Pretty sure the identification was the
T65s
and a brand new calf still bright yellow. Photographs on transient killer whale research blog and orca network.
