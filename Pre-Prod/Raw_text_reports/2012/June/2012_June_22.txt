Orca Sightings for June 22, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Watched part of J pod move up and down the westside of SJI. At

9:50am
from the West side preserve watched a mature male moving southbound quickly. Shortly after we some whales turned, we watched
J2, Granny and J8, Spieden
in the lead in the morning move northward past
Lime Kiln
. The trailers turned south again so J2 & J8 turned too. We left at

1:10pm, they were Hannah Heights
with one of the big males heading northward again. We returned to Lime Kiln about an hour later in the pouring rain and saw J16 and her children J26, 36 and assume
J42
was there.
J26
gave us that hearty pec slap (the photo used on the last report). They continued north.

Rain rain rain from the moment we left the dock until the moment we returned. It was well worth it though, we found J pod on the
west side of San Juan
heading up island. We spent time with
J2, J8, L87, J16
and her crew as well as
J14
and her crew.

Southern
residents AND transients
today, starting with some playful, tactile behavior from southern resident
J pod
members,
Polaris (J-28)
and her calf
Star (J-46)
near
False Bay, San Juan, around
1:00 pm.
As 'Mystic Sea' neared Eagle Point around
2:00 pm, three more J pod members came into view before they turned back towards False Bay.

Transients
crowned the day on the homeward trip as they cruised around
Pointer Island, Thatcher Pass at
3:30 pm
, eyeing up the potential bounty on offer - one unlucky seal copped it while dozens more bunched up together for safety. Despite the rain, passengers were privy to an exceptional educational treat.

Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries called to relay a report from the ferry Hyak of
three adult and 2 juvenile orcas heading east out of Thatcher Pass at
2:50 pm
.
*
Having heard reports of whale activity, Captain Craig took us east through
Upright Channel
and around the north end of
Lopez Island
where we found
6 Transient Orca Whales
surfacing and traveling together in Swifts Bay on the northeast side of the island. There were 2 large males and 2 youngsters in the pod. The whales would surface 3-4 times before diving for several minutes. Transient Killer Whales tend to be stealthier than the fish-eating Resident whales, because they hunt intelligent prey (marine mammals), so they did keep us guessing in which direction to look as they would surface somewhere new after each dive. The whales then began to slowly travel south towards Thatchers Pass.

Time:
1400 hours
Where: [general] Out in the Strait of Georgia from Cape Lazo
Where: [detail] exactly six nautical miles north [magnetic] from the
Comox Bar bell buoy (50-60 miles north of Nanaimo)
. My first sighting was the large black fin of the male orca from some 500 metres. As I closed on the pod I saw female orcas and what I believe were two juvenile males [the fins were smaller than the big male but not curved like the females]. All whales were close to the surface and swimming in a random manner. The two juvenile males periodically would lie together on the surface for some 15 seconds before submerging again. The pod did not seem to be traveling in any set direction. I guess that there were approximately six whales in total but there could have been more.

A woman studying at the Friday Harbor Labs at about
10 AM
this morning was rowing from the dock at the Labs to Friday Harbor. An
Orca Whale
suddenly BREACHED right near their tiny row boat. She said it 'scared her quite a bit'. She said before she could think and get her camera - it swam away.

Kari Keiski called from Brown Island, near the Friday Harbor marina, to say
5-6 orcas
, all females and juveniles, just went north up
San Juan Channel at 10 am
, very close to the Friday Harbor side.
