We saw
three killer whales off of Lime Kiln State Park about
4:00 pm
today! It was so exciting for "Midwesterns"--they are so beautiful!

About

4:45pm
today
a single adult male orca
slowly swam east to west past
Iceberg Point
. Then
between
5:45 and
6:30 another 8-12 orcas
followed, very slow and spread out. A few tail slaps and breaches, but mainly just slow progress westward.

3:44 PM -
We are seeing at least
2 Orca whales 150-200 yds off the Norwester building at NASWI
. There is a small whale watching boat accompanying them. It looks to only accommodate 12-15 people but it is chock full and they are getting their money's worth! They are heading South to North this time and seem to be riding the incoming tide. A bit of leaping and feeding activity. A fine sight, any time of day.

10:30 -
John Rogstad of WA State Ferries relayed a report from the captain of the Yakima of at least
a dozen orcas
abeam of
Anacortes
frolicking their way southward.
*
L87 (Onyx)
yesterday surfacing with a Salmon in his mouth! We were with the whales in the morning in
Rosario Strait
, and in the afternoon we were with them around the
Eagle Point
area. In the afternoon they were spread out and foraging. I'm always so happy to know they have food to eat. This salmon doesn't look very big, but then again in the mouth of a Killer Whale, most things look small! He surfaced several times with it in his mouth before moving on.
