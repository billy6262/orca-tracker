============================================================

Entry 1:
We witnessed

It was a fun day for the floating pandas as they took their time passing
Eagle Cove, San Juan Island
. Early in the
morning
, they were a mile out and very active. And then in the early
afternoon
, several waves of them came by from the southeast headed around the bend at the Point, presumably up to
Haro Strait
. Lots of breaches, tail lobbing and spy hopping! Several of them swam very close to the kelp beds as they rounded Eagle Point.

Love Is In the Air...Everywhere we looked around!!!!
J's and L's
were enjoying themselves today, intermingling just off the west side of San Juan Island,
Haro Strait
(48°32.60N, 123°10.58). There were approximately three different groups spread out and one of the groups had two large males intimately chasing after a set of females. We decided to give them a little privacy and let nature takes its course, so we went on to catch up with
"Moonlight" (L83) and her son "Midnight" (L110)
. The two were cruising pretty fast, porpoising out of the water to keep their speed, allowing us to see the full extent of their black and white bodies. They changed direction on us a few times giving us a little play, both on the starboard side and off the stern. Son was stickin' close to mama, demonstrating the true matriline connection that forms amongst the southern residents. Gotta love them mama's boys! We left them headed north at approximately

3:15PM
. Whether it was family love, or a little more-than-friendly love, it was all around today and man could you feel it!

Delighted to go off of
Henry Island to see J and L Pod
families swimming north, with the almost 10' flooding summer tide! They were spread out miles from each other, it was like a whale parade of 50 to 60 or more whales!! The Center for Whale Research folks were out taking photo identifications, so they will post the results. We were grateful to witness breaches, spy (sky) hops, tail lobbing, and foraging behaviors. To see the physically close families with many mothers and youngsters closer to shore, while older females and males tended to be out in Haro Strait, gave guests an insight to the culture and life long bonds these whales share. A group of males brought up the rear and began porpoise swimming, 2 together in synchronicity!!

Transient killer whales
T30, T30A, T30B and T30B1
were off
Discovery Island and Trial Island
near Victoria BC. Three harbor seals were taken with allot of splashing and circling with visible parts of the killed animal present. We arrived at Discovery Island and Trial Island to major Harbor seal Haul outs. The T30s with their new calf T30B1 were there traveling. Their pattern changed and they went into foraging mode. The Large Male T30A was doing long 7 minute dives while the females stayed above the surface. They soon located a harbor seal and two females using short bursts of speed rammed from different directions. There was a lot of fluke slapping and chasing. The group then separated into two units with T30A and T30 feeding closer to Trial Island while the other group went off shore. Typical inshore and offshore behavior. Remember transients as a top predator should not stay in one area while hunting for too long. They consumed three harbor seals within two hours.

Sarah Paturzo called to report seeing
6 orcas around
9:00 am
, about 100 yards from shore at the
Pigeon Point Light Station
, between
Santa Cruz and Halfmoon Bay, CA
near Pescadero, CA. She said there was one adult male, one subadult male, two females and two juveniles. They were feeding for over an hour. After about an hour the adults were going under for a few minutes at a time while the calves were fluke slapping at the surface.
