Orca Sightings for June 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Andy Stevens was sailing off
Brown's Point, west of Tacoma, about 5 pm
, when he saw
a gray whale
. He stayed with it for two hours. It was swimming well. He said it was much bigger than his 22' boat.
*
As we reached
Salmon Bank
, it took only a few minutes to spot
a minke whale
in the distance. As we slowed, we noticed that there was
more than one minke
around. Two surfaced at the same time, giving us an amazing look of their blow holes and bodies. But the minke whales weren't alone. There were harbor seals all around! They would poke their heads out of the water then dive back down. Also in the area were lots of harbor porpoise! We saw their small fins break the water surface in every direction off the boat. Sea birds were around too; gulls, cormorants, rhinoceros auklets, common murres, and even a pacific loon! Truly a spectacular day!

June 3 & 4 - It's been awfully quiet out on the water for the past few days, but we did find
multiple minkes at Salmon Bank
on
both
June 3 and 4
. There were at least two of them present both days, and they were surfacing frequently, skimming the surface with their mouths open but not lunge-feeding. Must have been plenty of food to be had out there, because there were a lot of Dall's and harbor porpoises and harbor seals around where the whales were.
