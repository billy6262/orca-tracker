Orca Sightings for June 27, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
With reports of
Resident Orcas on the west side of San Juan Island
and
Transient Orcas north of Stuart Island
, it was a tough call on which direction to take. Fortunately, heading north to search for Transients turned out to be a great choice! At Blundand Island (Gulf Islands, BC) we caught up to about
8 or more
tightly grouped whales (48°43'86N 123°10'9W), including
T102
, that seemed to be slowly moving along the island until something kicked a pair into action and they repeatedly porpoised along the island, took a long dive, then surfaced along with the rest of the group.

I am writing to report sighting of ~
7 orcas off the NE shore of Waldron Island
last night around

7:00
. They came from the direction of Sucia and Patos and were travelling south down the channel. They lingered off the shore for quite a long time and then continued on down, only to circle around and head back north but closer to the Orcas Island shoreline. I was wondering if anyone could tell me if these were residents or transients. I don't know enough to give much more info. There was one big daddy who seemed to stay further ahead while the rest lingered in what appreared to be a whole lot of frolicing.

We were with the residents in the middle of
Haro Strait
south of Kelp Reef when we got a call about a large group of
Transients near Turn Point
. We hurried over there and found
12-14 animals
and they were quite active and doing a lot of socializing with each other. There was one big male
T51, the T49's were there and The T36's
.
