J pod

.

We found
J-pod
spread wide apart at the south end of
Rosario Strait
, and later saw them off Iceberg Point on
Lopez Island
. Identified
J2 Granny and L87 Onyx, and J26 Mike
. We saw them again heading up the west side of San Juan Island as we headed south in the afternoon. We also spotted
two minke whales between Smith Island and Point Wilson
.

On one of the most beautiful days of the year, the last day of Spring, we watched
J Pod
feeding all day long from
South Lopez Island to Lime Kiln Park
, on the West Side of San Juan Island. We saw them last heading south toward Lime Kiln, but hear that they went north very early this morning.

We left Friday Harbor and headed down the eastern side of San Juan Island past Griffin Bay. As we came out upon
Salmon Bank
(48°25.45 N, 122°58.54 W), we found some members of
J-pod
including
Granny! L87, Onyx
, was also in the crowd. M/V Sea Lion then turned east towards Iceberg Point. There were at least four more members of J-pod swimming through. Looking at photos of the dorsal fin and saddle patch, we believe we saw J32, Rhapsody, but we would need a view of her right side to confirm. Many sights of tail-slapping and splashing.

12:58 PM -
At least
4-6 Orca Whales
about 100 yds off the shore going North to South in front of my workplace, The Norwester at
Naval Air Station
, Whidbey. At least 2 were smaller whales, babies but they were strung out quite a distance from each other! They appear to be spread over quite a distance because the whale watching boats are still North of us some ways. Must be more to come!
