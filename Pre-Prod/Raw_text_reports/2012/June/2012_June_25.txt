Orca Sightings for June 25, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out fishing in
Nanoose Bay
(about 20 miles NW of Nanaimo, BC) with a few buddies last Sunday. The day started off as usual, eating breakfast at home before heading out fishing. While eating I was staring out at the water when I saw the distinct dorsal fins of Killer Whales. I texted my buddy Greg who was already out fishing and let him know the whales were coming his way. Little did either of us know that we would soon get a bit closer to them than we bargained for! We hit the water to go fishing about an hour later and Greg gave me a shout on the radio indicating that the whales were nearby. I wanted to test the new cam so I headed over and pulled up beside him. Further out from us the whales were swimming past and I grabbed a few distant pics. You can find the photos here, at: One scared harbor seal.

At about

9:30 a.m. 3 orcas
were spotted in front of
Hannah Heights
. I went to check it out and saw some amazing behavior. The L's were coming in from the west. Two females were hanging out just south of Edwards Point close in to shore, while a male was about ½ mile south of them, also close in to shore. As the L's got to within about 2 miles of San Juan Island, heading towards Hannah Heights, the male orca started making a beeline for the L's. The two females stayed where they were. As the male got closer, about 15 whales lined up in a greeting line to meet the solo male. They met up & appeared to have a greeting ceremony just with the solo male. The solo male was L87, and the two females were J2 & J8. After this J2 & J8 made their way out to the others, then lead them up island slowly. Loved it!!

A great encounter with several L pod whales at Turn Pt. at
3:00 Monday.
*

11:00 -
heard that
L pod was off of Hannah Heights
. We drove to West Side preserve, easy to see them to the south, very spread out and milling and moving in all directions. One female in the lead started heading north at a steady pace. We moved to Lime Kiln to the south side overlook.
J & L pod
were passing us by

11:20am
(heard that some of J pod were off Whidbey NAS) 2-5 orca would porpoise in tandem right towards us! Witnessed some tactile behavior, rolls, tail slaps, and some breaches to the north in front of the lighthouse. They streamed by in groups a bit spread out for 20 minutes or more continuing the steady move northward. A stunning and beautiful morning with those majestic beings, such a gift!

Whales passed Eagle Cove at

heading north fairly close to shore. initially four adults with a large male breaching, followed by three adults and a juvenile! The youngster started breaching repeatedly! Could see others further out also heading north! Spectacular!

We had an exceptionally awesome day on the water today, including a great look at
L119 & L77
just north of
Henry Island
. We also witnessed some exciting mating behavior by
L41
. Kayak guide Michael identified members of
K, L, and part of J p
od on his tour today and observed a huge spy hop by an adult male inside Half Moon Bay on the west side of Henry Island.

Very exciting to hear that
Lpod
was making their way back into the Salish Sea. By the time our boat caught up with them, Lpod had met up with Jpod and they were all making their way east up
Boundary Pass
. They were fairly spread out, and in two groups, one at Turn Point on Stuart Island, the other closer to East Point on Saturna Island. We were with the leader group, which included the
J2s, the L26s, J19 and J41
, and several others. They made their way around East Point into the Strait of Georgia, where they spread out even more and broke into a bout of breaching, spyhopping, and porpoising.

Members of
J-Pod
were seen off of
South Pender Island
today. The whales were spread out and moving in an easterly direction. Several individuals were very surface active: spy hopping, lob tailing, rolling over, and even breaching! There were also a number of mature males including
J26, "Mike."
After spending some time with J-Pod, Captain Jim heard reports of L-Pod off Turn Point on Stuart Island (48°42.140 N, 123°15.687 W). Again the whales were spread out and traveling in an easterly direction. Among members of L-Pod, was L41 "Mega" a 35-year-old male! So, not only did we see whales from one pod today, we ended up seeing two different pods of the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale population!

At
12:30pm
, we observed a pod of
7 or more Orcas
feeding and playing next to
Smith Island
across from the corner of Ft. Nugent and West Beach Road on Whidbey Island. There was a mother and young Orca. The pod stayed in between the two island for more than an hour before heading South. Unfortunately, from the shore we were unable to see markings very clearly.

Marie Waterman of WA State Ferry Operations called to relay a report from the captain of the ferry Yakima, that
6-8 orcas
were headed west, just east of the Rickland bouy, in

.

Same gang of

T002C's, T090's, T100's, T101/102
Gangs. Watched them in the afternoon in an amazing little corner behind
Surge Narrows
bucking a 7-8 knot flood current to get up to Okisollo Channel (near
Campbell River, BC
). It was spectacular to say the least!
