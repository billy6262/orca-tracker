Myself and Russ Nicks were coming out of
Victoria harbor
and right away
L po
d was in front of us! we were like wow....it was
1030
when we picked them up. We followed for 2 hours and they were at Sombrio beach at 1230 according to a short calculation I made. But they were moving fast westward 9 knots at times in a straight line.

We heard a few rumors of Big Black Fish milling around Lime Kiln so we headed in that direction. As we passed
South Beach
we saw our first group of dorsal fins break the water surface (
Haro Strait
, 48°26.27N 123°01.48W). Big
"Mike" (J26)
somehow made his way into a group of female K's including
"Raggedy" (K40)
and seemed to be looking for a hot date! He was definitely showing off what he's got, wrestling around, and strutting his stuff. We figured we'd let him continue his pursuit and head west into open water to catch up with Cappuccino (K21). We rode alongside
Cappuccino (K21)
for a bit. He was just chillaxin' by his lonesome, milling around, doing his own thing. His pace was great for us though! We were able to cut the motor, watch him slowly emerge from the water, releasing large, exuding blows, and glide back slowly into the water. His actions were so smooth it caused passengers to grow silent, awestruck by the size and serenity of this amazing creature, living and breathing beside them. There were also a number of other groups
both from J-pod and K-pod
spread out in the surrounding area fishing and what not. The Kittiwake got to ride with both Blackberry (J27) and Polaris (J28). We ended up leaving the whales still milling around in the same area at approximately

3:30 PM
. All in all, it was another unbelievable day amongst our Southern Residents!

Happy to see
Balcomb's Orcas
Sunday
afternoon
off of
South Beach, San Juan Island
, spread out and foraging for salmon in a flooding tide. They don't often head east past Salmon Bank, and sure enough, the whales turned southwest and swam across the Strait of Juan de Fuca toward the Olympic peninsula. I have also observed they will then also travel west toward the Pacific, which sure enough they did!
