Orca Sightings for June 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
L pod and K40 were in Johnstone Strait
late this
afternoon and evening
. They were all business, which seems to be the way they are every time I see them in this neighbourhood. I left them eastbound off
Naka Creek at
19:00
with the end of a big flood behind them. It looked like about 35 whales in total. I haven't gone through the shots in great detail yet but did notice that L119 is still doing well next to L77.

L-Pod + for a total of 35 Southern Resident Orca
are on their way down Johnstone Strait
below Robson Bight at 1600 hrs
. We're keeping our eyes out for their arrival! I'll let you know if they make it this far or just zip past.

Granny J-2
was in the lead as members of
J Pod
began to pass by
Lime Kiln Pt. State Park at about
5:15pm
. Over the next one and a half hours, the whales moved up island sporadically, from close to a half mile off shore to more than two miles offshore. Those I was able to ID were:
J2, J19, J41, J14, J37, J45, J40, J34, J17, J44, J27
