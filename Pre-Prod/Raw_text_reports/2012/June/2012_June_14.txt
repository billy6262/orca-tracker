Today we spotted
CA50 and CA50b about 2 miles outside Moss Landing (CA) harbor at around
10:30am.
The pair was very stealthy & staying under for 10 minutes at a time. They moved in to just one mile from shore and then turned west. At some point (we did not see) they made a kill... we could see bits and pieces floating to the surface and birds began to gather. We then left the killer whales and headed out 3 miles from shore where we encountered
2 humpback whales
. The killer whales traveled through and passed within 100 yards of the humpbacks. No interaction took place as the humpbacks remained in the area and the killer whales continued southwest.
