Orca Sightings for June 1, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mary Campbell reports seeing at least
7 orcas
about 600 yards from shore at
Sekiu, about 10 am
. They were heading west and seemed to be feeding.
*
Went out with Island Adventures today. Saw some
orca and minkes
.
Granny
was one I know we saw and maybe Onyx along with a young one (not the new L babe).

2nd hand report this morning...
Whales near Anacortes
right now! Most likely
L pod
, this is the group with the brand new baby:) At

8:10
they passed Strawberry Island along the west shore of Cypress. They are moving fast with an ebb tide, heading south toward Washington Park.

The
T30s
were stalking around
D'Arcy Island
(mid-Haro Strait) today at around

1:15pm
. When we encountered them, they were traveling very slowly, surfacing as a group. There is a young calf in the group, who appears to be the offspring of
T30B
. They were displaying a pretty classic transient zig-zag pattern of surfacing, but doing so very slowly. They were making their way south for the most part.

We encountered transient orcas,
T30, T30A, T30B, T30B1 and T30C
, while on Maya's Westside Charters this afternoon as they traveled south on the west side of
D'Arcy Island
, BC. We left the scene at about

3:30
as the whales continued south passing to the west of Zero Rock.
