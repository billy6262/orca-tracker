Orca Sightings for June 9, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 26
*
L's in Swanson Channel
(with photos)
Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Bender
After receiving a tip from Jeff Lamarche that
L pod was heading south from Active Pass
, CWR staff left Snug Harbor at 1145 aboard Shachi to intercept them. We arrived on scene at
1225
near Otter Bay in northern Swanson Channel (48 47.537N 123 20.062W) to find
L pod spread out all the way across the channel
heading south fast. The whales were too spread out to find everyone there that day but we did see L77 and her new calf L119. Erin H. got a belly shot on L119 and it looks to be a female. We believe eight Ls (the L2s, the L54s, and L84) were not present and were off somewhere else. We followed the Ls as they continued south in Haro Strait in singles and small loose groups and left the whales in Mitchell Bay in front of Snug Harbor at 1448 (48 34.524N 123 11. 534W).

Mid-day, L-Pod
residents headed south, down
Haro Strait
with an ebbing tide, spread out in many groups. Off of Stuart and Henry Island, we were thrilled to see
L-77 Matia
with her new baby girl;
L-119
! And
L-41 Mega
looks regal; he is the eldest male in the Balcomb's Orcas, at 35 years old. The whales began to gather closer together and porpoise (fast, lunge) swim! We heard on the radio that J-Podders were off of Lime Kiln State Park, heading north! They turned south though; L-Podders joined them and a community gathering of
L and J Pod
families going back and forth in
Haro Strait
along San Juan Island, continued for hours! Out at Whale Watch Park, I watched them forage and socialize well into this special day and evening!

We had the best show of our lives out at
Lime Kiln
. We watched different groups from
J and L pod
for a total of 4 hours,
from 4-8
, coming in VERY close to shore (we were probably 20-30 feet from the whales that came by the lighthouse) and doing lots of surface activity - I saw a total of 14 breaches throughout the day, and countless tail lobs, pec slaps, spyhops....oh my! It was a party! Never felt luckier!

Ocean Sun L25
(Lolita's mom) surfaces with an adult male named
Mystery L85
behind her. Ocean Sun may have adopted Mystery now that he just lost a female named Alexis L12 who had adopted him when his mom died.

The first sighting at
Lime Kiln Point State Park
was of the southbound
J-Pod between 12 and
12:30
. Around
2:15, five J-Pod whales headed back north, followed by the rest of J-Pod about half an hour later, all of them pretty close to shore.
They met up with Ls north of the lighthouse
, and all the whales headed
south in Haro Strait at
3:00
. Once again, they didn't go far, and were
milling close to shore off of Land Bank for the next two hours
. It was amazing to watch, with the whales swimming in tight, slow-moving groups amid the choppy water as the wind had picked up. There seemed to be lots of touching and rolling around with each other. Finally, by
6 PM, all the whales headed north
once again. You can see some photos I took from today's amazing encounter here.

We got early reports of
J pod at battleship
going south but then
L pod popped up in Active Pass
! They were heading south around 9 knots....very hard to keep up with but awesome to see. I wasn't able to take any photos, I was just trying to keep up with them.

Today we caught up with 3
members of L-pod
, a female and her offspring, on the
west side of San Juan Island
(Haro Strait 48°33'56.84N, 123°10'50.29W). They were headed south right against the shore line, moving at a very quick rate. Within a few minutes of arriving we discovered that the female was
L-55
also known as "Nugget" and one of the calves was
L-118
! We were very excited to see L-118 return home with mama because this calf was just born last year (2011) and can now be given a proper name. It is days like these that really allow us to appreciate our Southern Resident Killer Whales, because although endangered, and battling many threats to their food and environment, mama still returns home with her calves showing us the true strength of the species. We left the group at approximately

3:03 PM
still making their way south, to catch up with the rest of the pod.

On the way home we found
a humpback in the Strait of Georgia!
It was lunge feeding over and over and making close passes by the boat. Here is a shot of a close pass.
