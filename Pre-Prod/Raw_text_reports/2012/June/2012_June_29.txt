Orca Sightings for June 29, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I came across
T002B in Oak Bay
on the
morning
. She went into the Chain Islands and skulked around the seal haulout for a few minutes. No kill was observed. She was last seen heading west.

9:10pm - 4-5 orcas
headed rapidly east to west past
Iceberg Point, Lopez Island
.

We caught up with the
whales just west of Eagle Cove
(48°27.92N, 123°04.29W) at the southern end of
San Juan Island
.
Eight members of J-pod
were spread out and traveling east along the coastline. J26 "Mike", a 21 year old male was traveling with his mother J16 "Slick" who was born in 1972. In general, male killer whales stay with their mothers their entire lives, only briefly leaving her and the pod to mate with females from different pods. Needless to say, these males bring a whole new meaning to the term "Mama's boy." We also saw J14 "Samish" a 38 year old female. Although the whales were primarily traveling they were surface active and did exhibit other behaviors including acrobatics. A calf breached not once, not twice, but FIVE times. Another whale turned over on her back and then slapped the surface with her tail while upside down.

2:30pm at least half a dozen orcas
traveling east to west off
Iceberg Point
, South Lopez Island. A few breaches and tail slaps as they go.

1245 -
Faint
calls
and loud echolocation clicks on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
--
1206 - J pod (S1/4) calls on Orcasound hydrophones
. Now echolocation clicks. No detections since
10:00 at Lime Kiln, so likely southbound in Haro Strait.

I was heading out hiking with my friend Jeff and got a call to head out on the ocean. We left from
Sooke
(NW of Victoria) and myself and Russ Nicks found a group of
transients T36s. T36B and her calf T36B1 as well as T36As and T36
. They traveled a steady route with occasional changes in movement where T36Bs traveled closer fanning out for prey and the T36As and T36 hunted offshore. Dives lasted 5 to 6 minutes.

9:09 am -
My husband just spotted
about a dozen Orcas
(probable transients) off the nwest side channel of
Guemes Island
. He said he saw a few babies, one breached the surface and saw one adult catch something and played with it for a few (not sure what "it" was, to far to tell). He was pretty excited to see them and feels pretty blessed when he does get to see them swim by his job site.

About 45 minutes ago, my mother and I saw
a whale off alki point
. It clearly wasn't an orca. It surfaced three times, and on the last showed a long back, a dorsal fin and it raised its tail. Then it disappeared. The strange thing was its dorsal fin. It was curved on the top, swept back, quite small relative to the back, closeish to the tail, pointed, with a crescent moon shape (like a cut out) down to the back. Now I have seen gray whales before and I don't remember them looking like that. It was big, like a gray, but not massive. It was heading north. Was this a humpback? Can a humpback be in the sound????

Humpbacks do occasionally travel into Puget Sound
