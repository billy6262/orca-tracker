============================================================

Entry 1:

T30's east of Baynes Channel

Observers: Dave Ellifrit
After receiving reports of the
T30's
and viewing them in Cordova Bay through the scope at CWR, I departed Snug Harbor in Orca at 1635 for a brief encounter. I arrived on scene at
1705
about a mile NE of
Baynes Channel
(48 27.87N 123 14. 07W) where the whales were milling and gulls were diving to pick up scraps so they had obviously just made a kill. One could even smell the greasy slick from the blubber of the seal or porpoise they had just eaten. I left the whales in the same spot at
1715
as they started moving SW toward Baynes Channel and arrived back at Snug Harbor at
1740
. Whales Photographed:
T30, T30A, T30B, T30B1, and T30C

Today we visited
five Orca Whales on the western side of D'Arcy Island
(mid-Haro Strait - 48°04.14N, 123°18.21W). As we approached the scene we could immediately tell they were Transients based on their stealthy behavior. Once they went under no one knew when, or where, they would come up next. After continually changing paths they unexpectedly surfaced right towards our boat providing us with a great amount of excitement and the most amazing view! There was
one LARGE male
, his dorsal fin standing almost 6 feet tall, along with
two small calves, and two females
. At first, it appeared they were feeding judging by the swarm of gulls hovering over their tracks, waiting to dive bomb any left overs, but after a while, it seemed as though they went back on the hunt as they chose one direction and stuck to it. They eventually gained speed and headed south, surfacing multiple times for shorter dives.
