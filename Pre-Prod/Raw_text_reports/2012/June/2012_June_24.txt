Orca Sightings for June 24, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:27am -
I started hearing calls on
Lime Kiln
so we drove down to the southern lookout at the park and watched as all of
J pod & L87
streamed northward at a steady pace in the beautiful calm of the morning seas. One female breached twice, 100 feet from the rocks.

Yeeeeeup, with the whole gang. Beautiful stuff. It was really interesting. We found
J2
hanging around off Helen Point at the south end of
Active Pass (around
3:15pm)
, waiting for the rest of J pod to catch up, who were all down the Mayne Island shore further. We waited with her for at least 20 minutes as the rest of the group made their way toward Active Pass, where J2 was waiting. This whole time, Granny was milling around, spyhopping occasionally, and logging at the surface. She also began to tail slap quite a bit, almost like she was getting impatient and signalling everyone else to hurry up (I know, major anthropomorphizing)! She didn't enter the pass until everyone was with her. It was really cool to watch! Once J pod in its entirety made their way through Active Pass and into the Strait of Georgia, they became really animated and started to breach, porpoise, spyhop, and tail slap. Their tight group formation split into various matrilineal groups, where they continued their way toward Point Roberts.

We spotted at least fifteen members of
J-pod just off the west side of North Pender
(48°48.22'N 123°19.93'W) traveling north. The whales were very close, almost on top of each other-true family bonding! We identified members of both the
J-22's
including "Oreo" (J-22)and her son "Cookie" (J-38), the J-17's including "Princess Angeline" (J-17) and her daughter "Polaris" (J-28), along with some other J's "Samish" (J-14). These whales were especially playful today: breaching, cartwheeling, spy hopping, lob tailing, rolling over, and swimming sideways were just a few of the amazing behaviors we witnessed. The cookie family seemed to be showing a lot more dough than their chocolate chip side today. :)

Jim Richison reported
30-40 orcas off Cape Alava at 9 am
, headed north fast, at 8-9 knots, at 48 11 by 124 59, in two groups spread out about a mile apart. He will send pictures when he gets them in a couple of days.

We just got a report from Tina Gurney who sighted a whale (
likely a gray whale
) yesterday around
7pm
swimming under the
Harstine Island Bridge
from north to south. The whale was gray in coloration, surfaced numerous times, had a visible blow, and no obvious dorsal fin. It was last seen swimming south towards Squaxin Island.

8:15 am - Minke whale
just north of
Ebey's landing
~ 1 mile out slowly heading south.

I spotted a
humpback in the Strait of Georgia
near active pass on the 3 sailing. On the 5 sailing back from Vancouver it was right beside the ferry being watched within close proximity! by 2 boats.
