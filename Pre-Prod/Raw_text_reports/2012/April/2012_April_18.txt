Orca Sightings for April 18, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit was able to identify individuals from Meg McDonald's photos in Colvos Passage by Southworth: Well, I'd bet the whale in the first pic is
T49A1
and the last pic may be
T65A3
so I think you probably have at least the
T49As, T49Bs, and T65As
down there. They have been spending a lot of time together this spring.

Phillip Parkes called with a report of
4 - 6 orcas in Nootka Sound
, at the base of the Muchalat Inlet, at Gold River, heading NW out toward the sea. There was one male, and he saw one spyhop while paddling a kayak. He said the locals told him that was the first time they'd seen an orca in Nootka Sound since Luna died there in March, 2006.

4 - 5 orcas

Watched
2 gray whales
this evening off
Jetty Island in Everett
from Harborview Park on Mukilteo Blvd. Wasn't sure at first if I was watching one very active whale or two, and then they both surfaced next to each other and spouted at the same time, so I knew it was two. One was prettty active, I saw fins and flukes a couple times, and one came out of the water enough one time to see that it had a lot of white on it's side. Wondering if maybe it was Patch.
