Between
12noon and 2pm
we saw about
20 Killer Whales
playing. they came by our boat within 15 feet. They were Spyhoping splashing about for the first hour. Later when we went to the North side of the Island they started to Breach. We saw 6 breaches in about 30 seconds. they continued to swim about and around our boat... At one time we had Orcas on all sides of the boat. At one time we saw 8 fins out of the water at the same time. We do not know how many whales were there we only guessed by seeing whales out each side that we could count 20.
