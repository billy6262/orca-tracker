Yesterday Transients Orcas, today
Residents Orcas
! Traveling all the way to
Mouat Point off North Pender Island
, Canada, we caught up with members of
J and K pod
. Although the Orcas kept us on the move, we paused long enough to see foraging, plenty of tail-slapping, a slow-motion spy-hop by Sekiu
(K-22
), and an excellent full-body breach! It was also a treat to clearly hear vocalizations on our hydrophone.
