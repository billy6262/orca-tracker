Orca Sightings for April 1, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
*
T65A's
Moresby Island
Observers: Dave Ellifrit and Jim Maya on Peregrine
After receiving reports of transients near Gooch Island, we left Snug Harbor with Capt. Jim Maya aboard Peregrine around
1:50 p.m. We arrived on scene at

2:20 p.m
. to find the
T65As (four animals)
milling just south of Moresby Island. The whales began traveling north into Swanson Channel where they soon fanned out in hunting mode. T65A2 was the westernmost whale while T65A and T65A4 were the closest to the bluffs along South Pender Island, B.C. T65A3 was somewhat in the middle. We left the whales still heading north in this formation at

3:10 p.m.
in lower
Swanson Channel
.

4:28 pm -
Jeff Lamarche call with a report of
T65A, T652, T65A3, and T65A4
, northbound 2.5 miles south of
Active Pass
.

Two phone calls about

1:15
, one from my naturalist, Jeanne Hyde and the other from Vancouver Whale Watch. John from VWW had found some Transient Orcas near
Gooch Island, BC
, about 30 minutes from our dock at Snug Resort and Marina on San Juan Island. In the boat with Jeanne, David Ellifrit, from the Center for Whale Research, and Lorie Gogic by

2:00.
After some sun, rain, and then sun again, we found them, the
T65As
, 30 minutes later. We just missed a kill on the south end of Moresby Island. First Orcas in five days. We left them in Swanson Channel headed N toward
Active Pass
.

We saw
a gray whale
making its way about

10:00
, a whale watching boat following, about 200 yards from shore. As it worked its way toward
Camano Head and Hat Island
, another whale watching boat (Victoria Clipper, a hydrofoil) arrived from the south, stopping outside the boat boundary for whales. I drove down to Camano Head (1/4 mile) and waited to see the whale come around the corner; but it never continued on its regular route towards Everett between Camano and Hat Islands. I wonder about the engines on this boat? The whale never resurfaced, my husband continuing to watch from our own bank, looking over at Langley, and myself at the Head. Sometimes the greys just seem to disappear!

On the
12pm
sailing from
Powell River to Comox
midway through the crossing, the crew announced sighting
a pod of orcas
in front of the ferry. We observed
6 orcas
in one group and one large male orca behind the ferry. We observed the male orca surface numerous times as it passed beside us. It came within about 100 metres of the ferry. It had a very tall, straight dorsal fin. The group of orcas in front of us turned towards the male orca and came towards us. We observed two medium sized orcas with a small orca swimming with each of them, a second large orca whose dorsal was bent over at the top and one other medium sized orca. After passing by the ferry's stern, the orcas turned north. I took a few photos from a distance. Enlarging them I could see the one large male orca's distinctive bent dorsal fin and some of the marking on one medium sized orcas.

Orcas
Northbound by
Campbell River at 6 pm
. Apparently some at Menzies Bay, near Seymour Narrows now. Not sure how many. Not sure if we had 2 groups here or just one - seems pretty quick for them to get to the Narrows in 1 hour. Later info: Sounds like the number of Orcas Northbound past Campbell River at 6pm was
4 to 6
. Sounds like there were between
10 to 15 Orca in Menzies Bay
. Just milling about. Lots of seals in there - unusual.
