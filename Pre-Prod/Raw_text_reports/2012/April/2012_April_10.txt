Orca Sightings for April 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We started hearing
Orca vocals
early this
morning
. Later they were sighted pretty far off shore of the
County Park
(west side of San Juan Is.). We think there are 19 in the pod.

10:45 am
a call came in that 8 to 10 Orca were very slowly headed Northward towards
Powell River
BC from just North of Black Point (also known as Albion Point). No large male dorsals were spotted. They were zig zagging back and forth between Texada Island and the mainland. There were some sea lions tight to the mainland shore heading South.

After a few calls to find out if they had maybe turned again, at

1:40 pm
they finally showed up tight to the
Texada
shore across from Westview,
Powell River
. I watched them as they appeared to have a snack where numerous Harbour Seals have been hauled out on the rocks. They slowly turned back towards Grief Point (Powell River) and around

2:45 pm
I caught up to them with the skiff. They were very spread out in smaller groups that were resting, milling about and a couple of calves were playfully splashing about all just off of Myrtle Rocks. With it being so calm and no traffic, I managed to hear some wonderfully clear communication (vocals) and echolocation amongst the group of around 10 to 16 Orca. Garry Henkel of Aboriginal Journeys joined me with his tour all the way from Campbell River. Our two boats enjoyed the show slowly Southward till we were just below Brew Bay. We watched the whales continue towards
Scotch Fir Point
till around

5:10 pm
.

two whales
from just south of
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, either gray whales or humpbacks, out in the middle of Admiralty Inlet, heading south.
