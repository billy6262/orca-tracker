Orca Sightings for April 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Captain Brian spotted a large male in the group of
T65As and the T49As & Bs
about 50 yards away. The male surfaced with a large adult seal draped across its half-open mouth! The orca made a shallow dive and Brian, Jesse, & guests could see the whole seal being held delicately in its mouth. All of a sudden...WOOOSH! The male surfaced right next to the Sea Hawk with the seal still in tow. Prior to that, a juvenile swam past with a fresh kill in its mouth. It was a little gory, but Brian & Jesse could follow the blood trail streaming from the whale's prey. Shortly after, small pieces of seal meat & blubber started surfacing around the boat. Brian estimated there was a slick about 30 yards long of blood, oil, and seal meat at the surface. All this happened near
Yellow Island just outside of Friday Harbor
.

On Maya's Westside Charters, we responded to a report of 2 whales south of
Constance Bank
, heading east. We located them by

12:45
.
T103 and T49C
, both males, were the two whales present. We left them about 6 miles west of
False Bay at
1:00
, as they headed south easterly. At

4:00
we met up with
10 whales
, heading north at
Flat Top Island
(Haro Strait), on the east side. Other boats had been on scene as these whales came north up San Juan Channel earlier. The whales present were
T49A, T49A1, T49A2, T49A3, T49B, T49B2, T65A, T65A2, T65A3 and T65A4
. We left them heading up
Boundary Pass at
4:40 pm
. More of the encounters of this day and pictures on my Blog.

While watching
many Dall's Porpoise
race around if front of
Limekiln Park
, we got word that
two Orcas had been spotted south of Victoria
. We zoomed off, but alas, couldn't find them. Then we heard about some
more Orcas near Cattle Pass
and started off to see if we could find them, and...Wouldn't you know it. Way off in the distance a blow. It's so exciting to see a blow in the distance. We saw two big males,
T103 and T49c
, and then headed for our dock at Snug Harbor Resort. Later in the afternoon, as the second group of Orcas got closer, we went out on our second trip of the day to see them. They were the
65As, and the 49As and Bs
. We left them at Sandy Pt. on
Waldron Island
.

This afternoon at

2:30
, we hear
a grey whale
approaching our bank from the west, across from
Langley
, about 100 yards from shore. It traveled steadily out of view to the southeast, and I got into my car and drove to Camano Head to see if it would come into sight, and what it would do. Once it was directly off the Head, it was only about 30 feet from shore and was going in circles, feeding..? The tide was not fully out, so it was in very shallow waters. Once it had surfaced three times, it headed around the corner northwards towards Port Susan. I walked around the Head hoping to see what it would do, and it slowly came around the corner, in no hurry. I then heard another flow coming from the direction of Hat Island, but didn't see it through the trees. The first whale slowed down but eventually continued on north, followed by the second whale. I have always been curious to know if grey whales feed off
Camano Head
, and maybe they do.

"Spouting News" PEDESTRIAN TORTOISE CATCHES GRAY - Glanced out window around

8:20AM
at [
Mariners Cove
] while having a morning latte' and wala,
a gray whale
splashing around with its fin out of the water. After, only a 5 minute laid back feed/snack [on an out going tide] it headed towards
Polnell Pt
. Walking, the beach to keep pace wasn't going to happen. as gray was on the move. Kept falling further behind. Along, the way, bystanders that observed the gray; included, a blue heron on large almost submerged rock, a myriad of eagles, and kingfisher. A 30 minute walk at my turtle pace was rewarded; as, I caught up with the gray, at the finish line. Which had stopped to feed several hundred feet from the shoreline. An adult bald eagle was also at the finish without a checkered flag. Only, 30 feet away on a low 20 foot high branch/almost above my right shoulder. Highly unusual for an adult eagle to allow a person to get this close, as they always will fly away. We both watched the gray feeding and when the whale started to leave, the eagle, while facing me, turned its head to watch the gray spout away. Minutes later, the eagle flew away. About 50 spouts later, I left the gray steamboating around the secluded bay, off Polnell Pt. A good morning walk, indeed.
