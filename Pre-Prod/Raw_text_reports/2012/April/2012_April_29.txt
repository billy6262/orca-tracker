============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a phone message from Roger Freel relaying a report of
at least 15 orcas off Westport, WA at 1700
between the #2 buoy and the mouth of Grays Harbor.

Cascadia Research
undertook a survey out of
Westport, Washington
, and encountered a group of
~25 southern resident killer whales
including individuals from
both K and L pods
. The whales were traveling rapidly to the north. We were able to photograph many of the individuals present and the photos are being sent to the Center for Whale Research and Northwest Fisheries Science Center to confirm identity of those whales present.

I believe I may have seen an
orca
. Solid black with very defined arch when it surfaced out of the water. I saw something black out of the corner of my eye and then saw it surface in rapid succession twice, and then once more about 15 minutes later further south. It did not have a large dorsal fin. It was not a humpback, gray whale, or dolphin. Off of
Joseph Whidbey State Park beach in Oak Harbor, WA
, traveling south.

We saw everything and it felt like we went everywhere today. After being on the water for over an hour a whale report came to Capt. Bill that the [
orcas
] were in
Haro Strait
near Canada parallel with the Lime Kiln lighthouse. Leaving Speiden Island we headed back to Haro Strait. On a mission to catch up with the whales, we nearly missed several Dall's porpoises foraging on the north side of Kelp Reef. Soon after, we caught up with a group of
approximately 6 Transient Orcas whales near Kelp Reef
.

My husband and I were in the South Sound (
Case Inlet
) and saw
a whale
today around noon. We couldn't tell if it was a grey what or a humpback. We saw it moving North toward Allyn and since there's no outlet going that way we thought we would see it going South but we never did. It was a very cool experience!
