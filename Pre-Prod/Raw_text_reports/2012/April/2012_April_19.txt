Orca Sightings for April 19, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amazingly enough (to me anyway!) about
2:oo
I stopped by Legion Park in north
Everett
. It took less than a minute to see the first blow, then looking that direction with my binocs, I caught
3 seperate whales spouting
all in the same time! It's crazy how many are hanging in that area at the moment.

Luana beach (Vashon Island) -
12:45ish
. Can anyone tell me what it was? No dorsal fin, but a triangle shaped "hump" in its place, large tail, loud blow hole sounds, gray and barnacle-y.... ? It was heading south- Towards Point Robinson. it was definitely
a Gray
, just a slight bump, no fin, lots of barnacles and "knuckles" for sure!

"Spouting News" - SARATOGA GRAY CAUGHT EXHALING
Shortly before
8AM
; a Mariners Cove friend and neighbor called to notify me, to check out
whale
spouts mid channel, between north Whidbey and Camano islands. Traveling south, first seen from Camano's Brown Pt., passing Utsalady Bay, old time boat house/fishing communities of Maple Grove and Camp Grande. Right before Camp Grande's boathouse near Camano's Rocky Pt,
gray
turned west towards Crescent Harbor off Polnell Pt. At one point, saw two spouts within a second of two of each other. Two whales, exhaling? However, that was the only time I saw the two spouts together and wonder if my eyes were playing tricks on me. Will be curious if any reports come out today of gray sightings from the Crescent Harbor off 'Oak Harbor" and/or Penn Cove near Coupeville.
