Orca Sightings for April 9, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had an incredible encounter on the Western Prince. We left Friday Harbor and were with the whales within 20 min. We caught up with the
T65's
(I think), a Mom and her 3 kids. We watched them from about
Yellow Island
heading north. They were spyhopping quite a bit and then when they rounded the corner, they started porpoising. After a couple min we caught back up with them and could tell that they were indeed
going after a Harbor Porpoise
. There were no other boats around and it was quite a sight. The Porpoise was thrown in the air, jumped on until it expired. We saw visible blood on the water and scraps that were getting carried away by gulls. It was a remarkable encounter. Here is a photo of the whale launching the harbor porpoise.

I love it when there are three sets of Orcas to visit. We only got to two sets, and saw
11 Orcas
in total...A larger group there were a total of 7 whales, the
T100s
- 5 of them, which included the two kids and
T11
and the big male
T11A
. The small group (San Juan Channel to Spieden, etc) of 4 whales were the
T65As
. (Thanks Jeanne Hyde, my amazing naturalist...Check out her Blog: Whale of A Purpose )

We were watching them from
Pt. No Point
between about

5:30pm and
7:00pm
when we had our last sighting. It didn't seem like they were in any hurry to pass thru, but were slowly continuing North at last sight, still outside of Useless Bay.

Useless Bay
. A few spy hops and tail splashes:)

2nd group just passed in front of
Kingston
Ferry, still west of mid channel, making good time northward. Revise to

with at least 1 big Male.

Just spotted what is probably the second group. Moving northward towards Kingston. West of mid channel, they just passed
Pt Jefferson
about 5 minutes ago. 6-8 orca.

Lori Wilson called from Ballard with a sighting of
5 or 6 orcas
headed north at a good clip off
West Point
, just north of Seattle.
*
And forwarded by Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries: I wanted to let you know that my step dad just called (~1

2:25 pm
) me to tell me he saw
6 or 7 Killer whales
just now up off of Sunset Beach in
Gig Harbor
. He said they are heading North toward Olalla.

From Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales at

11:45 am
: Group of
transient killer whales
are heading north near
Lincoln Park
.
*
Chris Kennedy relayed a report of
6 "juvenile" orcas
in
Dalco Passage
, heading west at

11:37 am
- which is likely the pod reported off Gig Harbor. The first pod that was heading north off Vashon earlier was reported below as being off Alki Pt. at

12:14 pm
, still heading north - so we have
TWO pods of orcas
in Puget Sound.
*
Believe I just (

11:20
) saw
3 orcas
off the coast of
Vashon
-- just south of the ferry terminal. They were headed north. I couldn't get to my telescope in time but I viewed them from W. Seattle. I saw the dorsal fins of at least 3 whales-- one looked a bit smaller than the others so maybe a youngster.

), mid-way between
Vashon Island and Fauntleroy
, heading north.
