On my way over to Whidbey this morning for the Welcome the Whales day, I saw
3 different grays
...one about half way across
between Mukilteo and Clinton
...one just off Clinton that did the most awesome high in the air tail flukes deep dive...and one more off Bells beach on my way to my friend Marilyn's house! I feel like it's a sign of good karma for a fantastic day ahead!

4:18 pm -
After a short search for them, Aaron,
Campbell River
Whale Watching found the Whales still in the same area. There were at least
8 Orca
in total with
T02C
and one Sprouter (young male whose dorsal is growing to it's adult size) and possibly another male off in the distant. The two groups of around 4 each joined together. 2 very young calves still tinged with orange were cavorting. They were resting, spyhopping and very slowly working their way towards the green buoy marking the end of Mystery Reef and the mainland. By

5:30 pm
when Aaron left them, the Orca were still between Savary and Grant's Reef. Reports were received over the radio from Aaron 'as it happened' and they never did show up closer to the mainland by dark

grey whale
surface and blow several times as it moved north of Steamboat Island and south into
Totten Inlet
(south Puget Sound), and later that same day as it returned to Budd Inlet and traveling North.
