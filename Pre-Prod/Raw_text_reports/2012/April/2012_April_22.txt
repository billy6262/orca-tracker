Orca Sightings for April 22, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
calls woke me up at

6:25 a.m.
Granny and her group were up ahead of the rest of the whales by a couple miles or more.
The rest of J pod - the J11s, J17s and J22s along with Cappuccino K-21, Raggedy K-40, Opus K-16 and Sonata K-35 were the trailing group
. I saw the K13s only once and was glad to see Deadhead K-27 and baby K-44. More of the day on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

Heidi Malcomson called with a report of
a pod of orcas
off West Side Road on
San Juan Island at
7:30 am
, heading south.

UNKNOWN WHALE (probably
a gray whale
, see
April 25 post). On both Saturday and Sunday in
East Sound Bay
, between
Olga and Obstruction Pass, Orcas Island
, we observed a solitary whale (humpback? gray? couldn't tell...) surfacing and moving slowly in the same general area. Couldn't tell the size since we were looking across the Bay from the White Beach area of Orcas. I was able to get numerous pictures of spouts and one picture actually captured the back as it surfaced - on blow up the whale looked extremely thin, with the spine quite prominent. We never saw a tail. We did see a head, though, and thought it looked like a humpback (which we have seen many times in Maui). At one point a fixed wing plane flew over the whale and circled him two or three times. The whale spent a good deal of time right on the surface from what we could tell at our distance. We first heard him spout on Saturday about 1000 and he disappeared about noon on Sunday. I thought you might want to know as he most likely is sick and may surface elsewhere in the San Juans... It is very unusual a whale is seen in this area (except maybe for rare orca).

1:22AM -
Spotted
a single gray whale
feeding in
Carr Inlet
, about a half mile S.W. of Cutt's Island off Kopachuck State Park (south Puget Sound). We watched for 30 minutes as it stayed in the area coming up several times to breathe and then going into a dive. We where more than a mile away and could see the blows and hear then a second later. This was the first gray whale I have seen in that bay, we were very excited.

Today we took off with reports of our
resident orcas coming north on the west side of San Juan Island
. We made our way slowly into Haro Strait
between Henry Island and Stuart Island
. Up came dorsals. Out came whale breath. Over all there may have been
15 - 20 animals
. They were traveling in small groups of 6 - 8 and it appeared to me that they were in a resting-style mode. Residents can be very vocal. No vocalizations today - we dropped the hydrophone three separate times. Residents can be very playful and energetic. None of that today. Lots of slow "up" and sinking back "down". The water was glass-like. No wind. No noise. It felt very peaceful bobbing in the water with the engine off.

Ken Balcomb just called to report that
J pod, K pod and L87
went north up San Juan Island this morning beginning around

6:30 am
. They headed north slowly in
Haro Strait
, working against the tide. When the tide changed, they started moving on, by about

3:20 pm
he believed they were up near Turn Pt, Stuart Island. Good to have some Resident orcas back in the neighborhood!

We found
gray whale #22
and with
another gray, southeast of Gedney Island
about halfway between Gedney and Everett, at

3:30pm
. After several deep dives showing their flukes, the whales logged on the surface, occasionally lifting a fluke out of the water.

One gray
spotted in the middle of
Possession Sound at
3:00
, just south of the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry route. Just one blow and then it was gone, on to the next meal!

Tonight around

10:00PM, two whales passed by Tulalip Shores
, heading north. Heard them for about 15 minutes until we couldn't hear them anymore as they turned the corner towards Spee-be-dah.

Gray whales in Cascade Bay, off Rosario, Orcas Island

Susen Oseth, Orcas Island

There were a number of
gray whales
seen some distance from the
Clinton-Mukilteo ferry
this morning about

9:10
, headed both north and south. Very still waters and easy to spot the blows.

We spotted a small boat with people leaning out watching something at about

11:30am
, just south of Oak Harbor. Then we spotted fins, and thought we had found some transient orcas. A closer look revealed them to be
Risso's dolphins
. I got a good look at the melon on one as it surfaced coming toward our boat, and one of them spyhopped, leaving no doubt about their identity. I wonder if they are the same ones that were in south Puget Sound a while back? They were milling around in the area where we found them, sometimes surfacing together a few times, sometimes with a few hundred yards between them. At one point a sea lion swam along with one of them for a few breaths! About

3:00 pm
we spotted two
Dall's porpoise
heading west between Gedney Island and Whidbey Island.
