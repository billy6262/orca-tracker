Orca Sightings for April 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:56 am -
Connie Barrett saw
a gray whale in Saratoga Passage
heading north about
1.5 miles from the Camano State Park
.
*
Saw and followed

(north of Everett) heading south
on 4/14
then today 4/23 watched and followed
two gray whales
just south of Warm Beach headed north up into
Port Susan
bay.

10:00-

13:00 -
We saw
possibly more than one Gray whale
(based on frequency of breath spouts) in the
Carr inlet
(south Puget Sound) between the Maple Hollow Park on the Key Peninsula and Horse Head Bay to the North and Fox Island to the South. It looked like feeding behavior with Fin out of the water and a lot of rolls, but I believe the water was fairly deep, as opposed to a tide flat.

2:40 pm -
Brooke McKinley saw
a gray whale
in the western side of
Crescent Harbor
while the necropsy was underway on the east side of the bay on the gray whale that was found off Camano Island on
April 22. Blows were seen until about
4 pm
.
*
Around
noon, two grays
passed by off shore from
Tulalip Shores
. They are heading north towards Spee-bi-dah. They don't seem to be feeding, but appear to be moving along with some purpose.
Vicki Mattson, Tulalip Shores

Grey Whale
feeding just off the shelf this morning (west side of
Whidbey Island
)! Looks to be alone but will keep looking. Moving from North to South so someone may catch it at Sunset Beach later this morning.

8:15 -
9:00 am -
Fred Lundahl is watching
two gray whales
in the mudflats off
Langley
.
*
This morning I had the delight of being woken up at

5:20 by a gray whale
feeding in front of my house, northwest of
Langley
(Saratoga Passage). The whale worked back and forth for 45 minutes before heading off to the north. I was not able to ID it.

Beam Reach students are observing
~10 transients
passing the
Lime Kiln lighthouse northbound at
11:30
this morning. There are
two groups of ~4 and ~6
, including an adult male and 1-2 calves. As they passed the lighthouse a
Steller sea lion
was swimming quickly southward, breathing hard...

From

3:15 a.m. to
4:00 a.m. transient calls
were on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. They started out faint, increased in volume, with lots of buzzing occurring at

3:30 a.m.
and at about the same time, I heard their calls for a few seconds on the Orca Sound hydrophones.

When we joined the
orcas
they were in
Haro Strait
, SE of Victoria, Canada. And they were headed west into open waters. It was a
part of J pod
that we were viewing - about 8 animals. They were in traveling mode. We watched the rhythmic up-for- air/down/travel/up-for-air. A youngster gave several tail slaps. And there were a few 'spy hops'. No vocalizations. We were all a bit mesmerized.
San Juan Safaris
*
On Maya's Westside Charters we encountered the
K14s, J14s, J-8, J-19 and L-87
. A couple others were present but I wasn't able to get ID pictures of them. We left them a few miles south of Discovery Island heading in a westerly direction
at
2:40. At
6:39 pm
I heard Resident calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. They were faint, increased in volume for a few minutes and then became so faint I had to have my speakers turned all the way up to hear them. Their calls lasted for about 18 minutes.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island

12:22pm - Four or more orca
, quite spread out, headed northwest past
Eagle Point
and presumably up the Haro. One came fairly close to shore here at the point, and others following at the same time were nearly a mile out. What a joy to hear, and see them, again!
Alex Shapiro
*

19:38pm
(approx) faint sound of calls on
lime kiln hydrophone
, two possible three distinct animals. Silenced by passing ship.
Nicole O'Neill
*
Josh Azevedo, a sport fisherman, called Orca Network to say that at

11:25 am
he had seen about
ten orcas
, 3 miles west of "the buoy" off
Ft. Bragg CA
in about 50 fathoms depth, seeming active. He had seen the signs all around the harbor with our number. No photos and no direction given.
*
Just to report a sighting of about
seven orca
at Myrtle Rocks this morning at

7:45 am
. They were heading south , taking long, long dives. What a great sight to wake up to!
Holly Roy,
Powell River

8:30 am - At least 6, maybe more, Orca
including 3 larger dorsals and at least one small calf tight together heading Southward. Between Myrtle Rocks and Black (Albion) Point, south of town.
Bill Taylor,
Powell River
