Orca Sightings for April 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1930 hr.
Along with hundreds of people on ferries between
Swartz Bay and Tsawassen
I saw a pod of
killer whales
doing what looked like feeding, hanging out, circling round and round in one area in
Active Pass between Mayne Island and Galiano Island
in BC. There were at least 6, 2 seemed small-young, mostly females, not sure if a male was with them or not.

6:56 pm -
Christina Baldwin called with a report of
4-5 orcas
in tight formation just south of
Bush Point, Whidbey Island
, for 30 minutes between the shipping bouy and Whidbey Island. One young male was among them.
*
We saw a large
pod of Orcas
in Puget Sound off the
"Seattle side" of Vashon Island
...lots of young whales too...They were swimming and breaching along side our power boat on the way back to Tacoma Sat eve. Very exciting!

The
orca
were always too far to ID and there was no research boat all day. Hopefully one of the boaters who tune in to ON got some photos to share. We leave now at

4:50pm
, last seeing blows just north of Vashon looking like they are heading down the east side. Beautiful day!

4:25pm -
Puget Sound Orca update. Watching from
Magnolia bluff
, the pod appears to be about a mile north of Vashon Island, still moving south. Ed just saw a couple of breaches.

11:34 am -
John Rogstad of WA State Ferries called to relay a report from the captain of the Spokane about a "plethora" of
orcas in the Edmonds to Kingston ferry lane
, "frolicking and acting like silly mammals."
*

9:22 am -
Just saw
3-4 orcas
just northwest of
Edmonds
on the ferry run to Kingston.

Exciting first day on the water! Not only were we rewarded with an unseasonably gorgeous, sunny day, but we caught up with approximately
7 Transients
traveling in
Swanson Channel
(BC Gulf Islands), just off Salt Spring Island, and with Ganges Harbor in sight. Since transients tend to travel in very small groups, 3 - 5, our sighting today was exceptional. Also exceptional was the fact that they continually surfaced, which gave us many good views.

Approx.
20 Orca near Turn Pt.
going N right now. (That's where Haro Strait turns right almost 90 degrees toward Vancouver, at the west tip of Stuart Island.)

6:30am -
We just had about
7+ orcas
head south very close to shore (Hannah Heights, west side of
San Juan Island
). Could not identify them as residents or transients- but there were two moms with youngsters and lots of tail lobs and rolls. Nice way to begin the weekend!
Sandy Buckley, west San Juan Island
*
We had the
T036's, T099's, and T037
off of
Moresby Island
in the morning. In the afternoon they were hunting seals in
Ganges Harbour, Saltspring Island
(BC Gulf Islands).

Single Gray Whale
sighted south of Skagit island and north of
Ala spit
(and Hope island, north end of Saratoga Passage). This morning about
11 am
spouting and appeared to be ;feeding along the tide line off
Skagit Island
. Then again this afternoon about

5:30pm
: repeatedly spouting as it circled the fish pen in Kiket Bay and rolling along the surface on the East side of the fish pen. No deep dives until it drifted off!
