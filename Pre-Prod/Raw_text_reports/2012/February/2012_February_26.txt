5:20 pm -
At least
20 Pacific White-sided Dolphins
were playing in the Queen of Burnaby's wake heading towards
Powell River
BC. A few leaps and surfing movements then they turned to follow the ferry's wake towards Comox. I spotted a few off to top of
Texada
around
6pm
, but I guess the rest continued with the ferry.
