============================================================

Entry 1:
At

15:45 hrs
, an
orca pod was spotted
off the shores of Security Services NW HQ, Fort Discovery, WA. Fort Discovery sits

, which is located
between Port Townsend and Sequim, WA
.

Dave Ellifrit looked at the video and replied: Yep, that's
K21
(I can't tell but I bet
K40, K16, and k35
are in there too) along with at least the
L2s, L5 and L84, and maybe the L54s
. Cool!
Cheers, Dave

I saw
at least 7 orcas
, including probably one male, moving south into
Discovery Bay
from the Strait. (Sent at

4:28 PM
