Orca Sightings for February 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
This morning on the
1:15 ferry from Vancouver about halfway to Langdale we saw a good size pod of
white-sided dolphins
. They were so close to the ferry. It was beautiful to watch them playing in the water. They were headed north.
