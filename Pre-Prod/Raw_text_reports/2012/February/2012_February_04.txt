Orca Sightings for February 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

5:16 pm
a crewmember on the WA St. Ferry called to say there were
orcas off Restoration Point
, Bainbridge Island, heading north, including three small ones and at least one big male.
*
At

5:44
Fred Felleman relayed a report from a friend who had seen
4 orcas in Elliot Bay
.
*
As viewed from Space Needle the Seattle-bound Bainbridge Ferry is about to pass north of a group of
orcas at
4:55
.
5-6 orcas
visible from Space Needle, heading north slowly from just
west of Elliott Bay
.

Got a short glimpse of them around

4:00
from Sunset Hill Park in
Ballard
. They were on the other side of West Point, though, but looked pretty active. I decided to head back over to West Seattle, but by the time I got there they had turned north again.

We saw
seven orcas
in the
Puget Sound
while we were at the Blue Ridge Park in Seattle at about

3:30 p.m.
. They were headed south. It was a special treat to see them!

You've probably already have heard this, but I just saw an article in the My Ballard blog (with photos and video) about Orcas sighted from
Golden Gardens
beach in Ballard, right next to Shilshole Marina and the Ballard Locks. It would be great if someone can ID this group! In the video it almost looks like there's a baby with the group (small fin initially seen right near the rear)? We've lived here for 23+ years but this is the first Orca sighting from this beach I've heard of. It's amazing how close they came to the small group of what appear to be tiny training sailboats.

They swam right by
Golden Gardens at
3:02pm
, about 300 yards off shore, near the big, round white buoy where the sea lions linger and through a Lazer regatta. Totally envious of those sailors - but it was an amazing view on shore as well! Watched them off and on for the hour as they swam towards Bainbridge and back. My first sightings, ever, and a day I'll never forget!!

220 pm -
Group of around 5-7 transients (most likely) about 1 mile wsw of
carkeek park
. Looks like they're headed west last time they were up but they were headed south initially. Probably a little north of meadow point still but definitely moving south now a fair ways offshore.
320 pm -
right off
west point
right now. in pretty close.
420 pm -
I'm at a pullout on
magnolia blvd
and there's a few visible due west a little ways offshore.

Saw about
7 Orcas
headed south at Edmond water front around

1:30pm
today. There was at least one male but they were too far away to get a good look. They were swimming pretty fast, not sure if they were hunting or trying to get away from the boats.

This afternoon at approximately

1:30
we observed a
Humpback Whale
breaching, rolling, pectoral slapping and generally have a great time! The location was approximately 300 yards off our home ( 9300 block/Hwy 106) on the south shore of
Hood Canal
generally across from Sisters Point. We are approximately 3-4 miles past the Great Bend. Our visitor appeared to be a juvenile (maybe the same as in Dabob Bay recently) and in our 10 minutes of observation we felt there was only one. We have watched our unexpected visitor continue to head in the direction of Twanoh State Park towards the closed end of Hood Canal and Belfair. We have observed numerous Humpback whales in the past at Neah Bay while salmon fishing and of course in Hawaii. Never have we seen a Humpback in this or any other part of Hood Canal. We have seen the transients orcas in 2005 and a couple of years prior and a few Grey Whales but never a Humpback.

Yup, Dad saw the whale that morning from our side (North Shore) right at Great Bend, (
Hood Canal
) twice. He was just beside himself, lol.

A
humpback whale
half-breaches near the 9300 block/Hwy 106 on the south shore of
Hood Canal
generally across from Sisters Point.
Mark Denniston,

Entry 2:
*
I live in
Totten Inlet
, in deep south sound. This morning I sighted two animals I believe to be orcas out front of our house. I can't imagine a mom and calf being alone, so maybe these are some other whales with similar-shaped dorsals. I saw them first about
10:45 AM and again about
1 PM
. They did not appear to be feeding actively but cruised south in Totten to about Deepwater Point and then turned around and headed out of the bay toward Steamboat Island. They typically went down for only half a minute or so and then surfaced. I was able to capture one dorsal fin, which is quite far away, but it might be of some value. It was over half a mile away, so it's not real clear even with the telephoto. Have there been any other sightings recently in south sound? They appeared to be swimming mostly close together, and both appeared to have the female shaped dorsal. One animal was smaller than the other.

From the photo and description it is possible these were the
Risso's dolphins
reported recently in the south Sound by Cascadia Research.

There was a pod of
Orcas
heading South past
Golden Gardens beach park
in Seattle on Saturday at

2:59pm
. I had my camera with me and was able to get some decent video footage of them from the beach.
