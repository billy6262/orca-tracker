Orca Sightings for February 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
A REPAIR JOB INSTANTLY REWARDED (Video)
... At Chuck Point, Barkley Sound, we repaired a broken fishery boundary marker to protect the closed areas and to have the fishermen avoid fines. A group of killer whales came to check the repairman.

A follow up with IDs from Heather Lord: The photos you sent me [extracted stills from the video] show T2C (Tasu), a female born in 1989, T2C1 (Rocky), T2C2 (Tumbo) and T2C3 (born in September) are all her offspring. T2C1 is the male, and we don't yet know the gender of T2C2 but it does have scoliosis, which is why the dorsal fin is so wobbly. We also don't know yet if the calf T2C3 is male or female. It's wonderful to see the group live and well.

Yay! Just got a message from Mary Pacher up the road here in Greenbank, and at

they were hearing
1, or possibly 2, Gray whales
blowing in
Saratoga Passage
