At about
1305
the Condor Express saw
six transient killer whales
(including a very young calf), 18 miles from the
Santa Barbara Harbor
(CA), near the shipping lanes by the Anacapa Islands. They were generally headed northwest. One of these whales is CA155; she is a seldom-seen transient, first photographed in 1983 in Monterey, CA. The new mom appears to be CA126; she also is a seldom-seen transient, first sighted in Monterey in 1994. Two of the other whales were previously sighted at least once (2007) off of Monterey, CA; they have the temporary designations of N170 and N170A.
