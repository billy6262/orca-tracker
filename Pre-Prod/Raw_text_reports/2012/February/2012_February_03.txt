Clarence just called from
Ebey Landing -
1:45 pm
- he can see
4 orcas mid-channel
, near the ferry lanes, heading south but in no particular hurry.
*
Another message from David Gluckman, who again saw the orcas while traveling from
Coupeville to Pt. Townsend on the ferry
. He was watching them at

1:43 pm
, they were feeding 300 - 400 yards from the ferry in several groups. He said there appeared to be
1 - 2 adult males, 4 - 5 females, and 2 juveniles or calves
. They were breaching & tail-slapping.

1:21 pm - More calls!

A call came in from David Gluckman at

11:35 about 4 orcas headed south down Admiralty Inlet
, between Keystone and Port Townsend, with possibly one male among them.
*
Now this is very significant for our records; this is the first time we've seen fish-eaters right in the heart of
Clayoquot Sound
. Called in at

08:50
, caught up with them at

09:05
in Browning Passage and followed them out of the pass, through Tofino Harbour>Templar Ch.>cut across between Wickanninish I. and Stubbs>Wilf Rocks where I had to abort at
10:03 because of open ocean conditions. This is an exit route normally used when the whales are heading up the coast. No time to look them up, can anyone tell me who they are, I'm guessing Northerns.

Jared Towers and Ken Balcomb have ID'd the orcas in these photos as the I11s, Northern Residents!

Whales and Dolphins BC received a late report of
3+ Orca
at the top end of
Johnstone Strait around 1 pm
. Later reports had these whales as Resident Orca.
