Orca Sightings for October 2, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted
4 humpbacks
in Port Madison (47' 43.6882, 122' 30.718, north of
Bainbridge Island
) at about
1pm
. They did a big circle in Port Madison before heading north. A crew on board got several minutes of HD video. They surfaced every 4 minutes or so.
