Orca Sightings for October 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Love it that the
So. Residents are already checking out the restored Elwha river
, along with the salmon who have wasted no time going up the river before the dam removals are even completed! At least there are whales around.
J Pod and K Pod are at the Elwha River
right now while
L Pod coming in from Victoria
.
2 Humpbacks were in San Juan Channel
this
morning
but have since exited though Cattle Pass and into Haro strait. There are
Transient orcas up north as well
.

6 Transient Orcas were seen 7 miles east of Sekiu
, and they were heading East along the kelp beds. There was at least one male (large dorsal fin) and they were aggressively hunting seals (throwing one of them into the air). I did not see the Orcas personally, but I got several first hand accounts and saw one video which was recorded by a fisherman who got much too close to the group of Orcas.

We were hiking around
Turn Island (outside Friday Harbor)
- and heard a strange notice - almost siren like - heard it again and saw a whale come up out of the water and just saw the tail as it went under - fluke like -
humpback
? At approx
11:30am. We heard the trumpeting sound several more times working its way around Turn Island in the direction of the point - but did not see it.

I live on the bluff at
North Beach, Port Townsend
. All day Sunday, there were
minkes in the Salish Sea between the Olympic Peninsula and the San Juans
. I've lived here for 7 years, and have never seen more than a rare glimpse of a loner. From
11am until the sun set
, especially in late afternoon, I saw several dozen surfacings. It was very hard to tell how many whales there were. They seemed to be going back and forth; there were some that were recognizable as pairs, some looked to be alone. I had the binoculars on a fish ball full of gulls when suddenly all dispersed and a 4' or so dorsal fin appeared and disappeared. No other sign of orcas, though.
