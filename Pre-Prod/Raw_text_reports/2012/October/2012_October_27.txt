5:15 pm
Orca Network board member Fred Lundahl of Langley reports
5 orcas off Clinton ferry dock
heading up Saratoga Passage!! Might be time to ring the Langley Whale Bell tonight if they continue up that way....
*
5ish -
I just got home from the
Mukilteo
area, got to the Lighthouse as just the tail end of the group was passing, probably about 5ish? Not positive about the time.. One large male closest to the Mukilteo side, probably 150 yds out from the lighthouse. Others spread out across the channel, a couple over towards the Clinton side, and one or two drifted more towards Hat Island area. Left there and ran up to Harborview Park, where we could see them out
between the Clinton and Hat Island area
, looking like they were coming back together more, and headed up the Saratoga direction last I could see of them.
