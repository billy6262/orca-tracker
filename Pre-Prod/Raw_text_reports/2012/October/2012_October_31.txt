Orca Sightings for October 31, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

11:45
this morning I was on the
south end of Lopez, near Iceberg Point
, watching a tanker moving through the choppy straits. Some of the splashing between me and the tanker was larger than the surrounding whitecaps and that splashing seemed to be moving east to west. After a few minutes of watching through the binoculars I was able to spot a
minke whale
breach completely clear of the water, heading west.
