Dolphin Pt, NE Vashon Island
, just south of the ferry dock - they are still moving south slowly, but doing a lot of foraging - good news! She said the water is nice and flat there, making for good viewing of the whales! Find a good beach south of there, or hop on one of the Vashon ferries for a good view of the orcas!
