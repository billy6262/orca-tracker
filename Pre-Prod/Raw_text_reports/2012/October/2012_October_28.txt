Orca Sightings for October 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
From the West Seattle Blog: We followed them
from roughly Alki all the way up to Mukilteo
. We had all the members of
J Pod, K Pod and a few L-Pod whales
as well. Didn't see any foraging, but just lots of slow travel and socializing. Collected several fecal samples in addition to all the photo identification work.

6:30 -
Pam, Cindy, Ed and I leave in darkness, could just see
Js & Ks gliding northward
100 yards out from
Edmonds dive Park
buoys. So close to this side they very well could be heading up Possession Sound towards Mukilteo. Saw breaches, tail lobbing just before nightfall. Amazing journey with orca and other wildlife today.

6:00 -
in the rain and waning daylight they are east of mid channel out from
South Edmonds /Kingston.
Foraging, tail lobbing and in general steady movement north

To the delight of everyone on board, we saw

on both the outbound and return ferry trips between
Seattle/Bainbridge
, about 200 yards off. Outbound at

10:35 ferry
: saw 4 or 5.... Return trip
at
2:05, saw 6-8
. They were playing, swimming, not sure about feeding. One breached up and out of water, then flopped on its side. Made everyone on board shriek with delight! On the return trip around
