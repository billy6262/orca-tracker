============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 72-1 and 2 -
T18's in Haro Strait
Observers: Ken Balcomb on Shachi. Erin Heydenreich, Lisa Moorby, Richard Philpot, and Jamie and Eilen Falahee on Orca.
On a return trip from Victoria, B.C. Ken received reports of T's off Bedwell Harbor. On the way across he encountered
2 humpbacks off Moresby Island at
12:20 pm.
About 20 minutes later he found the T18's. ... They were moving very slowly down Haro Strait. We spotted them off Kelp reef from the Center at
4:30 pm and shortly departed on Orca. We encountered the T's at
5:28 pm mid Haro Strait a few miles SE of Kelp Reef. ... We left them still heading slowly south about
4 miles off Lime Kiln State Park
