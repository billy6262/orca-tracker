Orca Sightings for September 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 71-2 -
L12's, L22's, J's and K's in Strait of Juan de Fuca
Observers: Ken Balcomb, Barbara Bender & Barbara Todd.
After departing from an earlier encounter (see encounter 70-1), we headed to Canada to greet incoming L pod whales. This encounter began at

4:10 pm
when we found L22 and L79 swimming together in a northeasterly direction. ... Continuing south we came across two sisters, L77 and L94, and their offspring L119 and L113. ... Next up we saw L25 and a bull in the distance and assumed that it was L85 based on social association of these whales. ... At one point L77 breached and her daughter, L119, was out of the water with her on her back! ... Then L77 stayed between L119 and L113 as she seemed to be pushing the baby up out of the water. Indeed this was very interesting behavior. Then a short moment later, J34 appeared out of nowhere with the group and they all swam off together. Before we knew it, there were groups of J, K and L pod whales heading southwest in our direction and right on out the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
. There was also a humpback in the area too known as "Split Fin" which seemed to be following the same path as the orcas. We watched it for a few moments and snapped a fluke ID photo before it took a long dive. We ended our encounter at
6:15 pm and returned back to Snug Harbor.
Whales Photographed:
J26, J27, J31, J32, J34, J36, J38, K13, K14, K21, K25, K26, K34, K36, K42, L22, L25, L41, L47, L53, L72, L77, L79, L83, L89, L91, L94, L105, L113, L115, and L119

Encounter # 70 -
J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait
Observers: Ken Balcomb, Barbara Bender and Barbara Todd on "Shachi."
... We encountered our first group of whales at

1:02 pm
which included the J14's, J16's, J19's, K14's and L72's. ... At one point we saw either J26 or J27 chasing after a salmon and we saw the fish go flying through the air. ... Majority of the whales were moving south down the
west side of San Juan Island
, however there were loose groups of whales over on the Canadian side of the strait. We changed course in that direction to see which whales were there. Here we found the J22's and the J17's who were traveling south as well. J34 was seen milling for a bit and we were surprised to see him leap out of the water as he did a half breach. There were rumors of the L12's incoming from the Juan de Fuca Strait so we ended our encounter at
3:40 pm to go find them.

Report of
Orcas off Sooke

I think I saw
a Minke at Point No Point WA
(Probably more than one :-). I had convinced myself it was a harbor porpoise, since it was out where they usually hang out, but the two times I saw it come up, it seemed a lot longer than a harbor porpoise. It also only came up to breath twice and disappeared, Normally, once I see the harbor porpoises they are coming up all the time it seems like.
