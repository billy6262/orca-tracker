There were
8-9 whales
headed north between
Middle Bank and Discovery Island
(48°23.02N, 123°12.54W). This was a rather large group for the
Transient Killer Whales
who are known to be very stealthy and elusive. Initially the whales were traveling in a tight group but as we continued watching them they began to spread out and form two smaller groups. They were still traveling within close range of each other; one group of whales was only a few body lengths ahead of the other group. On two different occasions we saw several of the whales circling and diving in a small area while several seagulls were swooping in from above...it turns out the Killer Whales were having a late lunch evident by the remains of what we suspect were Harbor Porpoise, based on our earlier sightings, floating at the surface. When it was time to head back to Friday Harbor the Transient Killer Whales had once again formed a tighter group and were traveling in close proximity of one another.

Wow, interesting day with
Transients
. They were pretty hungry as they dispatched 2 harbor porpoises fairly quickly.

Transient orca traveled up Haro Strait
, passing San Juan County Park at about
5 p.m.
They were at least 2 miles from shore. There were a few moments of action. Then they continued moving north. More of the day on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

About

11:30 AM
, a circus of whalewatch boats and a large
group of orcas
, eastbound. We were off Freshwater Bay on the
Olympics side of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Saw no large dorsals, and the fins looked curved to me. But my assumption was that we had transients.

We were approximately
8 miles SSW of Victoria Harbour in the afternoon
. I believe we were with a mix of the
T036's and the T071's
. Calm seas made for amazing reflections.
