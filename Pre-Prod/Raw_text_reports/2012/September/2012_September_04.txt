Orca Sightings for September 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 61 -
T20 and T21
Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Bender on "Orca."
We watched T20 and T21 come in close to shore past the Center for Whale Research at around
1:30 p.m. We shortly departed Snug Harbor and encountered the T's just outside of
Mitchell Bay.
We continued with the whales past Henry Island to Battleship, where they turned east through Spieden Channel. They were traveling in a loose formation, at a steady pace. We did not observe any foraging or hunting behavior. We left T20 and T21 at

4:30
as they went past the Cactus Islands around the eastern tip of Johns Island.

We found
Transient Killer Whales
near
Kellet Bluff
on the west side of
Henry Island
(48°36.15N, 123°12.60W). The whales were identified as
T20 and T21
. The whales were traveling north, tightly against the shoreline. Initially their behavior was predictable: several breaths at the surface before a deeper dive as they continued to hug the coastline. Then, the whales began to extend their dives and change direction under the surface. When they resurfaced, they were traveling east through Spieden Channel before again changing direction and continuing north around Green Point.
