Orca Sightings for September 9, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sunday was another beautiful day on the Salish Sea - and we were fortunate to find
several transients west of Sucia Island. T18, T19 and 19B
were amongst the group of 5-6 whales. They were milling in the area, doing some long dives, but didn't appear to be on a hunt. What a treat!
