Orca Sightings for September 24, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I would llike to report a sighting this afternoon. We saw
2 (maybe more) gray or humpback whales at about
3:45 off Shilshole bay
heading south. We were viewing from our house so we were at a large distance. The whales were pretty active. A bunch of tail-in-the-air dives (not sure what these are called). I also saw a full jump (breach?) by one of the whales. It was really spectacular! I almost don't believe what I saw.

Thought I'd share this picture of a
hybrid porpois
e we came across north of
Salmon Bank
during our
2pm
tour on Monday. It was with a large group of
Dall's Porpoise
that began to bow-ride our vessel.

Roughly ¼ mile offshore of San Juan Island
between Pile Point and Hannah Heights we found a Minke Whale
(48°28.45N, 123°06.48W)! The Minke Whale seemed extra curious today coming in for a closer look as it circled the stern of the vessel. Such a rare treat for this normally shy and elusive animal.
