Orca Sightings for September 12, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
You can file this under the "for what it's worth" - but I was told by a fisherman at
Point No Point (WA)
that on Wednesday last week there were
3 orcas
out at the end of the point, very close into shore, and one was trying to steal a salmon from a fly fisherman. Those guys are out in chest waders, and the whales were in very close.

We found
2 Humpback Whales outside of Victoria
, British Columbia near Race Rocks (48°18.14N, 123°30.73W). The whales would surface four or five times, their powerful exhales vaporizing the water over their blowholes into a 10ft high mist, and then dive raising their tail flukes out of the water. Fortunately their deeper dives lasted only 4-5 minutes so we had several opportunities to view these majestic beasties.

Out of Port Angeles in the vicinity of the yellow PA buoy, approximately 6 miles WNW of the end of Ediz Hook (shipping lane separator buoy), I saw
a whale spout
. The sighting was about
11 a.m
. There were 3 whale watching boats in the area, too. I don't know what species of whale it was.
