Orca Sightings for September 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had early morning reports that
all of the three pods of Resident orcas
were spotted on the west side of
San Juan Island
. Yay! But by noon, they were speeding past
Turn Point on Stuart
. But at
1:30 PM,
just after passing Moat Point on Pender Island, the whales gave us a reprieve and began rocketing south
! We had just passed Battleship Island and multiple groups of orcas were speed swimming (aka porpoising) down Haro Strait. Perfect! There were maybe 5 boats spread out over several miles, so we felt like we were having our own private wildlife experience. Taking photos was a bit hard at first as they were all porpoising and you just never really knew where to aim. But they settled down a bit as they approached Kellett Bluff, and that's when the other action started! Breach after breach after breach began. First in one group, and then in others. We counted over 30 breaches in less than an hour. It was awesome. Then as the whales slowed a bit, we were able to start getting a few IDs, including
Oreo, Doublestuff, Cookie, Polaris, Star, Lulu, Spock, Onyx, and more
. Lots of rolling at the surface and playing. The whale "parade" went on for quite awhile as each group made its' way down Haro.

The
Orcas
gave us quite a show today while we were out in our Whaler enjoying our vacation. Everyone was very respectful to them and gave them plenty of room to play. I had to crop a lot but it is still great to get to see them!! This was over by
Stuart Island
and they were headed for Lime Kiln it looked like..there were so many and they were spread out a lot.

Exciting land based viewing from
San Juan County Park and Lime Kiln State Park
between

3:00 and
5:00 pm
of
southern residents
ploughing through the white-caps - lots of activity, breaching, spy-hopping. Mike (J26) was the closest to shore, his dorsal fin silhouetted against the glare as he passed in front of the lighthouse on a beautiful clear day.
