Orca Sightings for September 13, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 64 -
J,K,L pods
Observers: Ken Balcomb, Erin Heydenreich, Barbara Bender, & Dan McSweeney
A few days ago, on
September 10th, members of all 3 pods returned after their previous sighting off the west side of San Juan Island on
September 6th. ... It was delightful to see the whales return today with beautiful weather and sea conditions. We departed in "Shachi" and began our encounter off land bank south of
Lime Kiln Lighthouse at
1:43 pm
when we found
J34
who was circling and chasing after a fish. ... We found mixed up groups of
J, K and L pod whales
making their way up island at a fairly slow pace. ...
J28
was seen logging a couple times and so were a few others. ... The
J14's
were traveling in tight group during the time we spent with them, and baby J49 was repeatedly popping up belly high doing what appeared to be spyhops or aerial scans. It is unusual behavior for such a young little baby. ... We ended our encounter at
4:08 pm just north of County Park with whales loosely spread and mostly traveling south.

I am friend of Capt. Jim Maya, I sent him some pics of the
super pod
we saw & what we experienced to be a scary occurrence. The super pod was magnificent, but a huge freighter started heading directly for them & right
at Henry Island
. The freighter seemed to be dramatically off course. It literally came between the whales & Henry Island at about 1/2 mile from Henry. It was rather disturbing. I am not sure if you have any clout in this matter but I don't think this was legal? See pics... Not only was it disturbing to watch it intersect the whales, it seemed dangerous for it to come that close to Henry Island. Are there rules for the freighters???
Kim Bruder
From ShipTraffic.com - a search for Star Epsilon shows the ship's track all the way to Vancouver, passing Henry Island at about Â½ mile, and about 500 m off turn Point. It was doing 10.7 knots on a bearing of 343 approaching Henry Island, then veered to a bearing of 337 at 10.6 knots away from Henry, then back to 345 at 10.9 knots up Haro Strait.

More
killer whales
! I ran into this active group as I was kayaking out of a nasty tidal rip, trying to head into
San Juan County Park
. The orcas were all over the place and were very active off the County Park for a couple more hours after I arrived. Here is the video link!
