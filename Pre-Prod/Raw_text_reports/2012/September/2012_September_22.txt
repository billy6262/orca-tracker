Orca Sightings for September 22, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 69 -
J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait
Observers: Ken Balcomb and Barbara Bender on Shachi; Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Todd on Orca.
"Shachi" departed Snug at
10:52 am and encountered whales at
11:25 am approximately Â½ mile north of Salmon Bank. As the whales were rounding the tip of San Juan Island we observed several cartwheels, breaches and taillobs. ... We found mixed groups of
J's, K's and L's
socializing and foraging as they worked their way northwest. There was a really nice group including the J11's, L72, L105, L92, L27, L86 and L106 that were socializing and spending time together during most of the day. We also found L83 and her son, L110, hanging out with K21 and L95. There were mixed groups all over as we worked our way north up San Juan Island. ... By the time the whales reached Kellett Bluff, they all seemed to stall out and wait for the J22's, J32, J28 and J46 to join up with them. ... We heard rumors of whales in Bounary Pass and were hoping to see both groups meet up, but the sun was setting quickly and so we ended our encounter at
7:15pm. When we departed the scene, the whales were milling in the kelp beds off the lighthouse and socializing once again. It was a spectacular day with the whales!

I was out on the water yesterday for a couple of hours (

3:30-
5:30
) as the whales progressed north from
Bellevue Pt to Battleship
. There were 3-4 brief direction changes at the end as the current approached slack low and the whales appeared to be lining up in a greeting ceremony. We left them continuing north as Ken returned from gassing up at Roche to take them into sunset. Tucker came up with at least 4 poos and could of had another if the whales did not change directions making it difficult for collection. A laden tanker was heading north bounds well as a partially loaded containership. A large bulker (coal?), tug and tow as well as a few other deep draft vessels were noted heading south. There was quite a few ww boats out for this time of year and they were pretty well behaved with the more offshore groups, but I was quite surprised how close vessels were getting as the whales hugged the shore north of Andrews Bay and along Kellet Bluff.

Blackberry (J27)
and
some of the L's
cruising in a tight group off
False Bay, San Juan
, around

1:30 pm
on a calm, peaceful day. Yellow research flags flying with tail-wagging Tucker the scat dog present, and NOAA applying suction cup tags. A rewarding trip for end-of-season passengers on 'Mystic Sea'.

Incredible day today in the
Strait of Georgia
! The water was so flat and the skies were overcast, it made for an awesome vibe with the whales. They were spread all over so we just shut the boat down and watched them forage and travel. We saw a lot of
J's and some K's
too.
