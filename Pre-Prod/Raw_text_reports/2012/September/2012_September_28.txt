Orca Sightings for September 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Every now and then, once or twice a year, we have a Top Ten Day! Yesterday was one of those days! While heading north to the T18s who were coming down
Swanson Channel, BC
, we ran into the
T36As and the T49As
. Right around
Cooper's Reef
, off the eastern tip of
Gooch Island
, they came together and started hunting the many seals that abound in that area. (The harbor seal population has exploded in our area) Here's a link to Jeanne Hyde's wonderful blog about the encounter.
