Orca Sightings for September 25, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
September has always been my favorite time of year and today was a great example of why! First,
3 Humpbacks around Moresby Island (Boundary Pass)
followed by the
T18's around Halibut Island (Haro Strait)
. After an awesome time with both species, we headed home. On the way, we found the
T100's in the Strait of Georgia!
They were is flat calm seas, which just made it that much nicer. Great day!

We decided not to cross the Strait of Georgia today because of rough weather. We, instead, went into
Howe Sound
(north of Vancouver BC) to look at the incredible scenery and, with any luck, some marine mammals. About 3 hours in we spotted a fin, which turned into about
15 more Pacific White Sided Dolphins
. The group was mostly mothers and calves and we had some incredible passes by them, nothing like seeing the whole pod underwater beside the boat!

There were
three humpbacks off of Eagle Point
in the afternoon. Saw a couple of great fluke-up dives.
