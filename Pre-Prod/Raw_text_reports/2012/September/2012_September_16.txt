Orca Sightings for September 16, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 66 -
J's, K's and L's in Boundary Pass
Observers: Ken Balcomb, Barbara Bender and Florian Graner on Shachi; Dave Ellifrit on "Orca."
J, K and L pod vocalizations had been heard on the hydrophones early before sunrise and continued for several hours. ... whales very spread out in Boundary Pass between South Pender and Stuart Island. ... At first we were with the L55's and soon a larger group formed including the
K13's, J2, J19
and several others. ... trailing groups were the L2's and L54's which have not been seen regularly with the rest of L pod in the summer months.

Orcas passed Saturna
. Pictures taken from near East Point around
noon
. Whales were feeding off Monarch head for 1 hour prior to passing E Point on their way to Fraser River. Number of Orcas would suggest superpod.
