3:00 PM - T10s
grouped in their usual threesome, scouring the shoreline near
Clover Point, Victoria
(48°23.97N 123°21.90W). Left them headed east for Haro Strait.

Two minke whales
off
Salmon Bank at
2:00 pm
heightened a glorious day for 'Mystic Sea' passengers, while the southern residents continued on north past Victoria. Steller sea lions with attitude held the fort at Whale Rocks, and harbor porpoise and seals swam in leisurely fashion or basked on the rocks enjoying the warm September sun.

Last Friday I was fishing out of Port Angeles in the vicinity of the yellow PA buoy, approximately
6 miles WNW of the end of Ediz Hook
(shipping lane separator buoy). About

1:30 p.m.
, a large
pod of Orcas
came through the area we were fishing. There were a number of males seen. Saw one whale breach. They seemed to be traveling in small groups of 3-5 whales. They hung around the buoy area for about 10 minutes and then moved on to the west. There were some whale watching boats out of Victoria in the area.
