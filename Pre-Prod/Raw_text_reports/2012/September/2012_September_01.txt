Entry 1:
We saw this
grey
while kayaking this morning about

7:30 am
. After about 30 minutes, he came closer and closer finally coming up right next to our kayak! Very exciting. 48 18'19.00 N, 124 25'22.29. Just east of Shipwreck Point and right in front of
Chito Beach Resort
(Sekiu, WA). Seemed to be feeding. We have been seeing one or up to 3 whales over the last week or so.

Whoo hoo - most of the
superpod
today, whales in every direction, we found them west of
Patos
. Lots of action, breaches, tail-lobs, a few spy-hops and LOTS of porpoising.
