gray
whales came by Langley, feeding close to shore. One definitely was a mature adult, I'm not sure if the second one was smaller or not.

Beauty of a day and whales very slowly moving up the West Side of San Juan Island. I spotted
J-Pod
around
10 AM
near Mitchell Point/Low Island, they were still hanging around, tightly grouped, and slowly moving North.

I just came in from watching a couple of
grays
go by Cama Beach heading North. One of my camp hosts heard it blowing and came and informed me around

6:30 am
. I for sure saw two grays with a possibility of a third smaller one about the size of a calf.
