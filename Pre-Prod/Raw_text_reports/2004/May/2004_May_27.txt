Orca Sightings for May 27, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Met up with
J-pod
off of Cypress Island. Great look at J-11 and her spunky calf. Sub groups were separating and then rejoining together during the time we observed them. J-22's all cruising together- J2 did a bow pass next to us when we were stopped that was as close as any I had ever seen. Her breath smelled sweet and clean. Half a dozen breaches on the cruise down.

The news of the day is that
some of L pod showed up in Blackfish Sound late this afternoon
; OrcaLab was able to see open saddle patches & at least 4 males. Jim Borrowman took photographs and positively ID'd L41 & L72. They observed about 20 whales. They were heading east in the Strait toward Robson Bight, & will likely show up down south soon. It is not known if any of the K pod whales were present, or if all the L's were present. We'll let you know as we get more news, keep an eye open for any fins out there!

We left
J Pod
today at

6:00 PM
headed back toward Eagle Pt.. from about 4 miles off of Lime Kiln Park, west side, San Juan Island. Unusual behavior. They were headed north, as has been their custom for the last couple of weeks, or so, and then they turned south west toward Discovery Island, like they had heard the K/L Pod siren song. They stopped, milled around for a while then headed back toward San Juan Island.

A very unpleasant morning. We went S.E. towards Hein Bank and over towards Iceberg Pt. We got the call of
transients
at Race Rocks, a pounding run in the pouring rain to find T20 and T21, missed the seal kill. In the afternoon a toss up to go meet the J's at the bottom of Rosario or west to relocate T20 and T21, the T's won or lost. We left them off shore near Sooke on a angle for Pillar Pt. Race Rocks had 11 El. Seals and 30 Steller and the same # of California's.
J's
went up the west side. Very cold and wet day.

Clouds and rains didn't deter us from going out in hopes of seeing
J-Pod
. A report of J-Pod in Rosario, so we headed East, and found them very spread out at the bottom of Rosario Strait, heading West towards Iceberg. For the most part, the whales stayed in groups of 2-3 until Iceberg, when about 8-10 bunched together as they passed the boat. Large waves out in the water made Ruffles & Granny practically pop out their chins as they came up for air. As we headed towards Cattle Point, we saw our first sighting of 3 Pomarine Jaegers as they flew past the bow.
