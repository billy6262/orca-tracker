============================================================

Entry 1:
As promised here is a belated report. Rich, Val, Marine Naturalist Training Program volunteer, and I heard very very faint calls over the SeaSound hydrophone array at Limekiln at

2:30pm
. Scanning the water we noticed the "fleet" coming around the corner at Discovery Island.

Ron Bates called with an interesting sighting by some fishermen off Swiftsure bank at the entrance to Juan de Fuca Strait. At around
7 pm
they saw a number (~10) of orcas pass by a humpback whale, and the humpback breached, but apparently wasn't under attack.
*
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called in a report of one gray whale between Mabana (SW Camano) & Langley (Whidbey Island) at

9:10 am
, sort of heading slowly west. The whale was ID'd as "new A" (it doesn't yet have an assigned number).
