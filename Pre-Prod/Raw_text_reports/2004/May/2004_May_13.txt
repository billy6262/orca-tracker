============================================================

Entry 1:
Belated report of J pod travelling from Cherry Pt. area south along west side Lummi Island and on towards Bellingham Channel on Thursday
May 13 from about 1230 to 1430. Very spread out and very active - lots of breaching, tail lobs, cartwheels, but moving right along.
