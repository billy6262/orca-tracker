A lone
gray
whale leisurely feeding off the West end of First St (Langley), about 300 ft out, headed East toward The Dog House ... Lots of breathing sounds; good visuals of its PECTORAL fin and tail... a lot of mottled "white" all over its back, and the one pectoral fin raised out of the water when feeding had a white BLUNT end at the tip.
