Orca Sightings for May 17, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
The animal reported as a fin whale (see
May 21 report) in Puget Sound is more likely a humpback whale. Todd Chander and Erin Falcone of Cascadia Research along with two volunteers did a survey of this region in response to reports of a gray whale. They instead found a juvenile humpback whale off the south end of Vashon Island who was very active and doing peduncle slaps (sideways slaps of the tail). This behavior and location is similar to the recent sighting reported which makes me think it is the same humpback whale.

From an email from Marilyn Joyce of Canada's DFO today: "We have confirmation that the sighting of
killer whales
off Tofino, B.C. on Monday
May 17th at
1300
hrs was indeed members of
K and L pods
. There have been no subsequent sightings and their last known direction was SW off Long Beach, on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
*
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research reported a pod of
15 Transients
off Discovery Island in the evening. Could be some of these whales that are visiting Dyes Inlet - John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research was out to get photos in Dyes Inlet yesterday, so hopefully we'll have some ID's of this pod soon.
