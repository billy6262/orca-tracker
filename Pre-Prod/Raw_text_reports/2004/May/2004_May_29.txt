Err, well, at the end of a long day, this is the best summary I can come up with. We had almost all of
L pod
minus the part of the L12's who were photographed with K's off Tofino a couple of weeks ago. L pod was incredibly spread out for the whole time we were with them, often in rather crappy weather of course.

L's
were at Kellett Bluff at

Our
1000
, had contact with
L's
off Monarch Hd. just before noon, Cedric, Jim Maya and myself were plotting as best we could from Pt. Roberts going to East Pt. about
1100

...between Salmon and Hein Bank...we did get to see the Minke.
L POD
finally arrived in the San Juans! Very spread out, with glassy water and cloudy skies, the whales put on quite the show with lots of breaches, cartwheels, tailslaps. Welcome back gang! As we headed in, we heard reports of
J-Pod
in Rosario Strait heading South, and
L-Pod
heading east.
