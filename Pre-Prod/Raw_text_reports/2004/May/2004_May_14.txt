We had two trips today, and saw
J Pod
each time. This afternoon, we met them as they came out of Active Pass. As usual, when they leave Active Pass, they explode. We all saw more breaching, tail lobbing, and porpoising in thirty minutes than in ten average trips! We left them at

4:00
PM, headed toward the Fraser River.

- It's been about two weeks since we last heard gray whales off our property on the West end of First St in Langley, but there they were this morning - two
grays
, feeding leisurely about 3-400 ft off shore, and slowly heading East toward downtown Langley.
