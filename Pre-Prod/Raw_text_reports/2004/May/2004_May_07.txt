Orca Sightings for May 7, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
A small pod of
Orcas
was spotted making their way south in Port Susan, about in the middle of the bay, opposite Kayak Pt. We don't often get them in here so it was exciting, even if they were far out in the bay. Estimate 3-5 individuals, just lazying south, doing a rolling shallow dive as they went, sometimes with a big tail slap.
