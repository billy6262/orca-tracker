Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called with his daily J pod report:
J pod
came in from Victoria at
10 or 11 am
, traveled down the west side of San Juan Island & were at South Beach

2:30 pm
. Later in the day they found them back north, swimming south past Lime Kiln Lighthouse, then at
7 pm
they were off the County Park foraging, lots of activity.
*
Brandon of Ferndale, WA called with this report on
J pod
from San Juan Island: They watched J's off Lime Kiln Pt, where they were split up & heading both north & south. They all then headed south down to South Beach later in the day, then west. They also saw 10 - 20 porpoises from Lime Kiln.
*
We were fortunate enough to have J-Pod arrive from Victoria to the West Side of San Juan Island. ... As the pod began to move more purposefully towards Hein Bank, they began to breach and become much more active.
