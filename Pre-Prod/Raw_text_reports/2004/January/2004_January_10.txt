Orca Sightings for January 10, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We sighted a pod of whales (approximately 8-12 whales) off Double Bluff (SW Whidbey Island) heading North at

8:30 am
. They were traveling fast and there was no other activity until they passed a Hanjin Ship. Shortly after passing the ship they became very active and began breaching for several minutes then moved out of sight Northward past Bush point. There were 2 large males, several females and one calf. We live in Skunk Bay and were observing through binoculars so no identification was possible. Made my day.
