Orca Sightings for December 26, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amy Carey & others reported seeing some
J pod
whales with the
K's
.
*
We caught them (
orcas
) around

3:30
as they passed Alki Point with a few small craft in escort (mostly behaving themselves). Saw some fantastic breaches, and some spy-hops and tail lobs, then they picked up speed and headed north. Lost sight of them around

4:30
with the sunset. With the Olympics behind them covered in fresh snow, it was an amazing and beautiful sight!

Saw at least 8
orca
from Lincoln Park in Seattle, travelling north. We first sighted them at about

3:30pm
; they were moving fast. At least one larger fin apparent. When they were just north of the bay offshore Bremerton, they stopped and stayed in one place for a bit - lots of breaching and tails -maybe feeding? They started moving again, and 2 ferry boats had to pause their route. We last saw them still headed north as the sun was setting at around

4:30
. We also saw a pod of Dall's porpoise headed south; they were much closer in to shore than the orca. Only saw them for one round of surfacing, then lost them in the sun on the water.

*
Amy Carey of Vashon Island called to report the
orcas
about 1 mile south of the Fauntleroy ferry terminal at

2:15 pm
