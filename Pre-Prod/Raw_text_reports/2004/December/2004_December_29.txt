Orca Sightings for December 29, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
FYI, I "heard" a
pod
go past Pt Richmond (Colvos) last night about

9:30 pm
heading north. We could tell they were Orca by the deeper breath sounds. They seem to have been circling Vashon for a couple of days.

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at

3:20 pm
to report a pod of
orcas
(possibly K's) heading south, just south of Dolphin Pt. on the east side of Vashon Island, traveling close together & close to the Vashon side of the passage. There is a Coast Guard boat out with them.

2
orcas
(1 an adult male) seen at

10:15 am
off the Seattle waterfront heading west. There may have been more than 2 but only 2 seen for sure. No ID.
