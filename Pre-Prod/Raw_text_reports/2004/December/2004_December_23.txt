Orca Sightings for December 23, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I would like to report an
Orca
sighting. Washington State, South Puget Sound, Dash Point State Park (just n. of Commencement Bay, Tacoma). I saw the whales at about

2:30 PM
, from the beach at the state park. They were about a mile SW of the beach, heading south. I saw at least one large male, and at least several other whales. They were a long ways from the beach, so no details visible. They seemed to be cruising along, I did not see anything to indicate feeding activity.

I spotted a small
porpoise
which looked like a dall's porpoise right off of Saratoga Whidbey Is. It was around
2
, but unfortunatly the fog made us turn back and head to Oak Harbor. FYI it was alone heading north. (plenty of seals out there!)

It was already a bonus day for marine life sightings but then came a
Minke
whale passing Lime Kiln Lighthouse. It was out several hundred yards, traveling north, and documented on video!
