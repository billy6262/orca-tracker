Orca Sightings for December 31, 2004

whales
in this sighting.

We received sighting reports at Cascadia Research of a
gray whale
and
killer whales
in Budd Inlet. We conduceted a survey that afternoon. We found a pod of 7 transients including T87 and T88 (have not done a thorough check of the animals yet) and one calf. They traveled from Boston Harbor in Budd Inlet north headed up Pickering Passage. They attacked a harbor seal in Pickering Passage. We did not get a chance to confirm the gray whale sighting but received several reports in both Budd and Eld Inlet. This is the time of the southbound migration and we occassionally get gray whales into the sound for short periods this time of year.

We had a wonderful day today watching whales just about as far south as you can possibly get in Puget Sound (north of Steamboat Island in south Puget Sound).
Dave and Cynthia Kettel
The Kettles sent in a photo of a male Transient that appears to be T87 (will confirm with Center for Whale Research - sb
).

Another caller reported a
pod
of whales WAY down south, just north of Olympia in Squaxin Passage, between Hope & Steamboat Islands, heading north toward the Hartstine Island bridge at

1:52 pm
. He reported 2 adults & 3 calves - sounds similar to the reports off Bainbridge yesterday, likely a transient pod.

Tom McMillen called at

2:35 pm
to report
K'
s were in a resting pattern just north of the Vashon ferry terminal, heading back down south. The Center for Whale Research was able to confirm & ID all of K pod as being present.

Orcas
off Pt Richmond (Colvos) at

10:00 hrs
. One breached about 100 yds of Pt Richmond. There are about 5 as far as I can tell and don't see any males. They are heading north slowly.

They're off Ollala, mid channel and still heading north (~11 am). They are dispersed over a wide area and I still figure about 5-8
whales
.
