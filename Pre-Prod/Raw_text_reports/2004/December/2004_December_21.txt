8:00am
- I saw a pod of
Orcas
heading south through Colvos Passage. They were moving slowly, made a few small turns, possibly feeding near Peter Point, which is at the north end of Vashon Island. There was at least 1 male who lingered while the pod past by. He made some turns and spent some time near the point as did a few of the females.

From our hillside high on east side of Vashon in the Glen Acres area, observed group of
orcas
heading south in the Sound.

8:55 AM
. Could have been about 10 individuals but hard to tell. Unknown what they were doing other than they were slowly moving south. The pod was spread out about a half mile. Saw many fins, some blows, and a small amount of their bodies coming out of water. Saw at least one big fin so probably a male. This was our first sighting of orcas.
