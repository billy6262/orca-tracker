Orca Sightings for December 28, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw about 8
Orcas
in Colvos Passage (47 24 N, 122 32 W) at

2:20pm
as I was sailing south in the sail boat. They were heading north. The females and young ones were moving up the middle of the channel and looked like 2 males were off close to the west shore. Lots of action.
