Orca Sightings for December 12, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
...we saw 3 Transient
orca
heading west off Fulford Reef. They then swung in to hunt along the rocks. The male's fin was bent over and fairly tatty looking but it was impossible to get a good clear look.

A Canadian Coast Guard Aux. vessel was sent from its base in Oak Bay to assist a kayaker at the North East corner of Oak Bay, during the rescue they encountered 3
transients
(1 male 2 others). This was
0900
after taking the party into Oak Bay they went back to try for a ID. Whales were gone. At
1200
a male was seen at Enterprise Reef at the South West end of Oak Bay. Part of the 3 or a new one?
