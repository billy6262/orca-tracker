Orca Sightings for December 25, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
@

10:00AM
. There was a large pod of
orcas
heading north in Puget Sound waters just off Brace Point, near the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal. There appeared to be anywhere from 5 to 8 in the pod. They seemed to be moving at a fairly rapid pace.

...around

11:15 am
we saw a large pod of
orcas
from our location just south of Brace Point. They were spread out and slowly moving north. They put on quite a Christmas show with several breaches. I would estimate they were not more than 100 yds off shore. We watch them for around ten minutes until they moved out of sight past Brace Point.

While riding the

2:20
ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle, we could see
orcas
between the Bainbridge and Bremerton ferries about halfway through the trip. I'm no expert so I couldn't begin to tell you which pod or if there were any young ones out there.

I saw five or more off Brace Point and thought it would be a good idea if I reported the sighting. I live on the water and am always looking for the
orcas
.
