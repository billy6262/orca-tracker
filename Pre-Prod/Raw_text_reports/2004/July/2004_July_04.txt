Orca Sightings for July 4, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
With a large flood tide,
J-Pod
used it to rocket up the west side of San Juan Island after spending the morning out near Salmon Bank. The group was very spread out, traveling in groups of 2-3. No vocalizations, but we had a very nice "dive by" as one whale swam just under the surface and under the boat while most of the other members of the pod were closer to shore.
