Orca Sightings for July 14, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
"My noon-hour ferry from Victoria to Vancouver passed as close as20 metres to a pod of killer whales while entering Active Pass. The whales followed the ship although they were right alongside it as we rounded the island [Mayne] into the Pass. The ferry slowed, but didn't wait - as all the whale watchers did. One of the staff said BC Ferries often gets close to the whales."

L's
going right through Pedder Bay in the early evening. There was one POW boat on scene; most of them were too far off from my little fishing boat to get a good look for an ID. Now I see they have been spotted near Sheringham PT., which fits the time-period.

The Center called yesterday morning and
j and k
were in front of the house at

7:00 am
(west San Juan Island). Anyway, they were all there except of course k18 who i really miss. Every time i see K 21 and K 40 off by themselves i remember the great encounters i had with the 3 of them by ourselves. But k 37 put on a little show of his (or her) own to make us forget. I put some new photos up and a couple of good shots of him. http://www.salishsea.com He has a really cool little open saddle on the right. There are tons of fish coming thru right now and the Orcas are definitly happy.

The day started early this morning with
J's & K's
very tightly grouped as they headed North of Henry Island. The UW research boat was out and said they got incredible data on the whales as they slowly moved along the west side. Later in the morning as the whales neared Turn Point they began to spread out quite a distance, with some spectacular belly-flop breaches. The whales then began to group up again as they approached and then entered Active Pass. Meanwhile,
L Pod
showed up out of the fog near Hein Bank in the afternoon. They began to quickly porpoise towards False Bay, where they met up with the other half of L-Pod, and began to forage back and forth between Edwards Point and Cattle Point.
