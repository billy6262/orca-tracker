Orca Sightings for July 16, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

6:30 a.m
., we were heading out of the Victoria Harbor... there were about 20
orca
feeding in Enterprise Channel, as close as 100' offshore! There was at least one male. Then, they turned, in unison, and swam across our stern about 50' away - not feeding. It was as if they just knew we just wanted to see them!
