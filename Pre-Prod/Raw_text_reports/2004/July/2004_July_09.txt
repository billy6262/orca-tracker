============================================================

Entry 1:
Zipped up to Fraser River in the afternoon (about
1700
) to see
J's and L's
heading south along the bank - there were mulitple and synchronous breachings (!), spyhops, high porpoising, tail lobs, and of course the old upside down swimming antics.
