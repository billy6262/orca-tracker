Orca Sightings for July 21, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were out on the water
early
off of Eagle Point with part of
L-Pod
. They were not in a big hurry as they headed east, and soon they were in Rosario Channel. About this time, we got paged that
J's, K's, & the rest of the L's
were at Turn Point and heading down the island. We monitored the boats as the now Super Pod passed quickly past Lime Kiln Lighthouse. Some breaches, lots of porpoising, and whales everywhere. As the whales headed further offshore, they began to get very active with dozens of breaches, tail lobs, porpoising.
As we were doing a vessel count, we noticed 3 whales off in a group by themselves near shore, and trending in our general direction. It appeared to be L-21 (Ankh) and gang. Lots of touching, playing in kelp, chin-high spy hops. As we watched this group, we saw a
Dall's porpoise
near the group. We were stunned as we saw a second Dall's in with the group of 3. ...the three whales were actually playing with a baby Dalls porpoise, holding it on their rostrums, putting it on their backs, and even a couple of times holding it in their mouths!!!! John Ford & Graeme Ellis happened to be nearby doing research, so we called them over to get the incident captured on video. The group passed under their boat, audibly vocalizing above the surface, and soon headed off. And sadly, there was the baby Dall's porpoise floating dead in the water. We hauled it in, only to discover that it was probably only hours old, with fetal folds and remnants of the umbilical cord still attached. As I held it in my hands, it was still twitching slightly and warm.
