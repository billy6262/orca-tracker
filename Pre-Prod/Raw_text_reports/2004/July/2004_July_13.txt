Orca Sightings for July 13, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lime Kiln Lighthouse,
5 PM
all three pods, (they said "hundreds!"), just off the rocks there. One group coming from the north, and the other group coming from the south converging there with lots of action. They were there for over an hour and thrilled to see them for the first time, and so close.

J's & most of the L's
in Boundary Pass near Saturna, slowly heading towards Turn Point. And boy were these guys having what appeared to be a ball! So many vocalizations as they passed the boat. Multiple breaches, spy hops, tail lobs. The works. Then they worked the shoreline on the backside of Stuart, playing within feet of shore, and giving a couple of kayakers the thrill of a lifetime! At one point they hit a pool of sunlight and literally flew underwater so fast we could hardly track them underwater!
