Orca Sightings for July 26, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales back by San Juan Island. Passed the County campground at about

9:30 a.m
. All spread out, some in close enough to give us a thrill and especially 2 of our friends in Kayaks.

L54, Ino, (I think) and her calf spent an extended period of time toying with a newborn Harbor Porpoise calf. We don't think they ate it, but it must have been terrified. Once they pushed it right up to our boat, and we got a very close look at the process. It looked like the porpoise was playing, and could have gotten away, but didn't. We thought they were playing with a disabled salmon for a few moments, it was so small, but then they brought it up to the boat. This is the second incident in recent days. Some members of L pod exhibit this kind of behavior. They drowned a new Dall's calf the other day. Tough world out there. I have seen Orca calves playing with seal pups in the same manner before.
Js and Ks
went north. The
L12s
were near Eagle Pt, and the rest of the Ls went up Boundry Pass. They should be back today.

After a 2 day hiatus,
all 3 pods
returned to the islands where they were very missed! J's & K's led the return early in the morning. From the house, I saw several distant individuals make huge breach splashes in Speiden Channel. In the afternoon, we were able to observe part of L-Pod as they passed the Center heading for Open Bay. Lots of foraging activity as well as what I guess you could call "touchie feelie", and many turn-arounds as they went back and forth. L-41, L-71, L-27 were playing in and near the Kelp at Balcomb Reef, and actually turned into Andrews Bay. Tons of vocalizations as the whales were extremely spread out.
