Orca Sightings for July 3, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
at Cherry Point. We only got to see the whales for 5 minutes, and they must have known we weren't going to be able to watch long, so they changed course and came parallel with the boat. All 22 came up so we could see them.
