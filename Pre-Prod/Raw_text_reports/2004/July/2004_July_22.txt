Orca Sightings for July 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Js, Ks and several other Ls
went north in the
afternoon
And a Minke near Eagle Pt. Sometimes I have observed Minkes traveling with Orcas, and behaving like them...Porpoising and breaching...This one breached this morning.

We came out of the western end of Speiden Channel just in time to have
L-Pod
coming North from Kellett Bluff and
J's & K's
coming south from Turn Point! But the J's & K's got tricky and headed slowly north again as L's entered the area. The L's kept us on our toes today as they were really mixing up the sub-groups. Great vocalizations and tight traveling groups. As they crossed towards the Turn Point Lighthouse, a few whales began breaching! We caught up with Ruffles and the other J's in the southern end of Swanson Channel.
