At about

5:10 pm
I just happened to look out through our telescope, wondering if the
Transient
pod might be in our neighborhood, & the first thing I saw when I looked through the scope was an orca surfacing! ...they fed in the area between Lowell Pt, Camano Island, & East Point & Baby Island at the entrance to Holmes Harbor. They were first right off Lowell Pt, then headed into Holmes Harbor at a fast porpoise, then stopped to do more hunting. We reluctantly left them, but they were still feeding in the area near the entrance to Holmes Harbor. It looks like 6 orcas, with one or two young ones.

At about noon today several of us saw a lone whale blow once or twice before disappearing between Langley and Camano Islands.

From about

11:00am
there has been a group of 4-5
Orcas
just off the Tulalip Shores coastline. There appears to be one baby in the group. They have been jumping, flapping and generally milling about for the past two hours. They have now moved further west into the middle of the channel between Camano Island and Tulalip shores.
