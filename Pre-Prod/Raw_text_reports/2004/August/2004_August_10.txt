Orca Sightings for August 10, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today I got to watch 5
transients
off the Edwards Point-Hannah Heights area between
3 pm and 5 pm
. The whale watch operators identified the male transient as
T14
. They also said that there were 4 transients, but there was also a small calf travelling very close to its mother. It did not surface as often as the others, unless they were travelling. As the transients crossed the straits toward San Juan Island, I spotted a group of at least 4 Dall's porpoises about 1/2 mile offshore, heading north along the west side of the island, travelling a little south of the transients, but perpendicular to them. As I watched with some trepidation, suddenly the transients started thrashing around behind one of the whale watch zodiacs, right around where I had last seen the dall's. The activity of the transients was pretty amazing--one leaped out of the water and did an almost perfect orca "swan" dive. I had not seen an orca do this before. Although I suspected that one of the dall's had become lunch, I heard over the marine radio that a harbor seal had jumped out of the water onto the engine bracket of one of the zodiacs. It stayed there for apparently more than 15 minutes, until the transients had moved south quite a distance. I don't know how the boat operator enticed it back into the water, but it was probably interesting!
