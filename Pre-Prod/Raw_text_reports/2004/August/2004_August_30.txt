L-12's
from yesterday were still hanging out near False Bay. We had an
early morning
charter. Mystery, Matia, Mega (hey, all "M" whales) gave us nice viewings. Later in the afternoon I heard that the L-12's were actually going UP Rosario Channel while the other 3 groups of Southern Residents were slowly coming down Rosario.
