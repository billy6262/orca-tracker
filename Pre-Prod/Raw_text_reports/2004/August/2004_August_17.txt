Orca Sightings for August 17, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
As you will remember, I met on the East Point rocks on Tuesday evening as we watched the whales swim by. I've had a chance to study my many photos from that swim-by and I just thought you'd like to know for your records that they were mainly L-pod whales, not Js. In fact, the only J-pod whale I can positively identify is J1, so perhaps he was "out on a date" with one of the L-pod girls! I still have to go through all the photos with the ID book, so maybe there were other Js mixed in there. Or perhaps some of the Js were in that bunch of 5-7 whales that came by about 45 mins before the main group. They were too far out for me to confirm IDs and there were no adult males.
