Orca Sightings for August 18, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
all 3 pods (less the L-12's
, which were headed out west in the Straits past Victoria) moving very fast down Boundary Pass towards Turn Point. They were using the outgoing tide as their own little built-in turbo boost, and were porpoising and breaching across the water. A quick turn at Turn Point and down the west side of San Juan Channel. At one point they looked as if they were going right at Discovery Island (which sometimes means they are outta here), but the J's veered away from the pack at Henry Island and slowed way down in Open Bay. After doing the "west side tour", the whales began a meandering zig-zag towards Hein Bank. Then they acted as if they were going to do a spontaneous greeting ceremony with themselves as they gathered into a very tight group. Even though we were doing vessel counts and paper work, it was hard not to steal a glance as 70 whales came up to the surface almost simultaneously and blowing all at once. The whales then turned and headed back north along San Juan Island and we headed home as the fog began to roll in. I last saw the whales once again back at Open Bay.
