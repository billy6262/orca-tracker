Orca Sightings for August 15, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Sunday
morning
, we walked from our guest house on North Pender Island to Thieves Bay anticipating the regular passing of a group of
Southern Residents
. We arrived to hear that a large group (10 or so) had already gone by headed north, towards Active Pass. But a few minutes later we were treated to a very close shoreline pass of ten or so more Orcas.

Cascadia ran a small-boat survey off the outer Washington coast
August 15. Erin Falcone and I left Westport, headed north and west about 40 miles (out to about 16 miles offshore), then further west to about 35 miles offshore into deep water (>1000 m), and back south staying in deep water. All together we covered 130+ nautical miles. We found two groups of humpbacks both 10 or more miles offshore. One was a mother-calf pair, and the calf had obviously been attacked by killer whales, missing half of its flukes. The other group, a trio, were acting similar to a competitive group on the breeding grounds. Other marine mammals sighted included a few groups of harbour porpoises and half a dozen juvenile northern fur seals.

Started out with
L Pod
actively porpoising past the house towards the Center For Whale Research (west side San Juan Island). Reports come in all morning that
all 3 pods
are moving up the west side of San Juan Island going North. And luckily, the L12's, staying with tradition of not going up to Active Pass turn around and return south. We waited at the entrance to Speiden Channel, and the L12's didn't disappoint. When I got home and began cooking dinner, I looked out the kitchen window and saw that the whales were at the same place as when the day started.
