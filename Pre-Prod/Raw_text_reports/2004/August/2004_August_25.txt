Orca Sightings for August 25, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients
off Danger Shoals and the "M-pod" (
L12's
) at Cattle Point. We opted for the L12's and motored through the fog banks and rain on an absolutely mystical day. The ocean was flat with a low, slow, oily swell. No wind, only the hiss of the rain on the sea and just 5 other boats 1 mile south of the Cattle Pass entrance. Mega breached 3 times as we arrived. We saw some of the best spy hops all year and viewing was awesome with the whales showing against the featureless water/sky blend. One behavior I've never seen was 2 or 3 whales lying at the surface with just their rostrum held out of the water. The POW zod' named "The Jester" had drifted close as we all watched, the Canadian skipper and I speculated what this odd behavior was all about. I liked his idea that the whales may have just been enjoying the novelty of a hard rain on their sensitive skin.

I picked up the
T18's
with the T20's off of Victoria this morning at
830
heading east. They swam into a bait ball off of Trial and took out a seal. I heard that they killed another seal in Haro Strait near Henry Island and then took out a couple of Dall's porpoise in the afternoon. I missed all the excitement as I got sidetracked with the T11's who appeared off of Esquimalt at
1130
. I left them at
1400
off of William Head heading for Race Passage.
Cheers,

I just saw a
Killer Whale pod
(I think there were 4 or 5) swimming no more than 100 yards from our ferry in the Strait just off Tsawwassen. They were heading towards Active Pass. Cool.
