I just (
1 pm
) received a call from a Mrs. Adkins, who spotted what sounds like a
gray whale
in Agate Passage near Bainbridge Island. She saw a large grayish animal with "splotches" north of Agate Pass Bridge and south of Agate Point.

After much searching the
whales (orcas)
were located by listening to a Hydrophone south of Race Rocks in the fog. That was in the morning and my last info was they were still going west past Jordan River in the late afternoon. A report in the afternoon of an assault on a baby Harbour Porpoise, it may have been killed.
