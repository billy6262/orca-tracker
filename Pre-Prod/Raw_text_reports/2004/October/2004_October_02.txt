Orca Sightings for October 2, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just received a call from the Center for Whale Research, reporting
all three pods
south of Useless Bay, SW Whidbey at

2:30 pm
today. I didn't get a direction, but Dave said they had been headed down from Pt. Roberts yesterday, so they are likely headed south but I'm not sure.

I stayed late at the Limekiln lighhouse working on the SeaSound system. Minutes after getting the first successful live time streaming audio and video running what could only have been most, if not all of the southern residents came into vocal range and put on an incredible show. It was well after dark, but the moon had not risen. I sat on the rocks in front of the lighthouse and heard explosive blows coming from every direction without ever seeing a single whale, including one which surfaced just outside of the kelp bed (about 40 feet from shore).
