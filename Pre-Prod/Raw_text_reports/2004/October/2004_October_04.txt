Orca Sightings for October 4, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Time of sighting was around

4:30pm
at Point No Point. There were about 6 to 8
Orcas
. Far off from the main group appeared to be a male (Whidby Island area) the rest of the group was spread out with (looked like females) their babies swimming with them. They were too far off to notice just how many but looked to be 3 younger and 4 adults swimming. It appeared that they were feeding on the local salmon and when done started to swim towards the Whidby Island area and towards the shipping lanes going towards Port Townsend Washington.

Several neighbors were out tonight watching at Bush Point. They spotted 20 plus
whales
who were tail slapping etc. You could hear the tails slap in the water. They headed north, then some returned south. Darkness set in so we could not see if the southbound whales came north again. This was between

6:40 and
7:15 pm
at Bush Point (W. Whidbey Island).
