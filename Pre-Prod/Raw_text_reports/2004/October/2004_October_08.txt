Orca Sightings for October 8, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
At around

10:30 a.m.
, I saw an amazing sight approaching Hannah Heights. All three pods in a resting line heading north. They started from about 20 yards inshore and spread out in a horizontal line outwards at least 150 yards, diving and breathing in unison. This was the largest resting line I have seen. I could see only one orca that wasn't in the line. She was about a quarter of mile behind, tail slapping furiously. Although I couldn't identify her due to the distance, I wouldn't be surprised if it were L12. Within about 15 minutes, the L12's broke away, while all the others headed north. The larger group (all but the L12's) turned south again just short of Lime Kiln. For the next several hours against a good flood tide, the orcas seemed to swim in place in several resting lines between Land Bank and Lime Kiln. Some groups periodically took a break from resting to forage a little. Finally, the L12's swam north, meeting up with the others just south of Lime Kiln. Then they all went south with the L12's leading. They stopped offshore between Hannah Heights and Pile Point and foraged for hours. While the whales were doing their resting thing, I spotted an elephant seal off of Land Bank. It was resting until it was approached by a boat. It quickly submerged and I never saw it again. There was also a male Stellar sea lion actively flaying salmon close inshore and attracting lots of seagulls. It was quite interesting. As J pod went south the sea lion purposefully swam parallel to it, less than twenty feet away. I could detect no change in J pod's behavior, not even from the younger calves or their moms.

Ron Bates called at about
3 pm
this afternoon with the great news of a new
L pod calf
, possibly with L43 but that is not yet confirmed. He updated us tonight with: The new calf was seen and photographed by at least 3 boats. The Center was unable to make contact. Mother seems to be L43 although L72 was there.
