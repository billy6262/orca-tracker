I have been watching two
humpbacks
off of Victoria's waterfront (off of beacon hill park). Tails, backs, and today multiple breaches and tail slapping (when a float plane took off near by). Been watching them for 4-5 hours each day. Staying in same location - back and forth from race rocks to the buoy out a few miles from BH park.
