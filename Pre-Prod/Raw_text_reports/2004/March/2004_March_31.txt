3:00 pm
one gray whale spotted swimming to the west by the boat ramp at Camano Island State Park. It was fairly close along the Camano shoreline. It didn't appear to be feeding. It breached two times in quick succession--maybe 45 seconds apart, then continued to travel west along the shoreline of Camano. I saw and heard it breach four more times, then lost sight of it, but did hear it one more time.

Beginning about

1:30p
and lasting for a good half hour, two gray whales - one large, one small - were seen feeding off Langley's shores, on the West end of First Street. They started some 2-300 ft off shore, leisurely feeding on their sides, front and aft fins showing prominently. After 15 minutes they slowly worked themselves farther away from shore, turning NORTH.

A friend and I saw 2 gray whales about 100 feet or less from the Langley waterfront from about

1:30-
2:30 p.m
. today. They appeared to be about the same size; we think they were feeding--they would roll around with fins up, cruise a bit and dive then reappear and roll some more. Gulls were hanging around for left overs probably.

At

1:30 p.m.
we spotted two grays offshore from Sandy Point (near Langley), heading south. One of the whales was definitely larger than the other, so these may be the mother and calf reported earlier.
