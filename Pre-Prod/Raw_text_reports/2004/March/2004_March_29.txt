Orca Sightings for March 29, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30 a.m
. My cousin Greg and I spotted 3 whales in the Saratoga Passage in Clinton, just north of the ferry. We followed them for probably a half hour up to Possession Point.

6:45 p.m.
- we saw double blows off Indian Point on the west side of Whidbey Island. They were quite far out, and we could only see the blows, most often in pairs.

I picked up J's this afternoon at
1315
6 miles south of Sooke (fairly close to Crescent Beach - South Vancouver Island). They were very spread out and heading west. I could not find J1 anywhere on the horizon; however, I was pressed for time. On my afternoon trip I picked them up on the Canadian side of the Juan de Fuca between 2 and 3 miles south of Otter Point. I left them in big seas still heading west at 1630 approaching Sheringham Pt. I just went through my photos and made a positive ID on J28, J26, J16, J17, and J8.
