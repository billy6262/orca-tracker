We received the report below this morning, but I wasn't able to get out to the bluff until a little after noon. But thanks to sunny skies I was able to see a whale spouting just north of East Pt (near the entrance to Holmes Harbor), about half way between East Pt. & Camano Island. I watched as it traveled south, headed toward Langley, & was able to see it surface a time or two.
