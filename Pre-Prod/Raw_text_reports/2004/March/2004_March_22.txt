Orca Sightings for March 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
A report of orcas off Lummi Island [this] morning! About

8:45-
9:15 a.m
. a neighbor saw about 20 orcas heading south towards Rosario Strait, very spread out - no IDs, sounds like they were about a mile and a half or two off Lummi...there was some breaching, that's how they were spotted.

Our day started out great!! We were waiting for the 8 am Clinton/Mukilteo ferry, when I saw two gray whale spouts over toward Everett at

7:40 am
. They were headed south along the mainland side, & when the ferry was about half-way across, the whales had changed course to head toward Whidbey, & surfaced right next to the ferry at

8:10 am
! Another whale was reported off Langley during that same time period, & below are many other reports of those lucky to see grays on this beautiful sunny day.

Beginning
6:30 this morning, TWO gray whales, one large, one small, fed leisurely about 100 feet off shore along the west end of First Street, Langley. By

7:15
they were in back of The Dog House, seemingly on a slow, steady path south. Sandy Pointers should be seeing them before too long. Great blow SOUNDS and good viewing as they fed.
Cheers,
Sharen & Simon

Deborah Koff-Chapin reported a gray whale feeding close to shore just north of Langley at

6:15 am
, for at least 30 minutes.

We had the pleasure of watching a gray whale this morning in Langley, out in front of the marina....around

.

From about

4:20 PM
today until

4:50 PM
I saw a California Gray Whale surface four times half way between the Mukilteo ferry dock and Columbia Beach (just south of the Clinton ferry dock) heading north. It appears to be only one whale and it was too far out for me to photograph.
