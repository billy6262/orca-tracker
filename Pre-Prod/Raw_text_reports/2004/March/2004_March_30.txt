Orca Sightings for March 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:30 a.m
. We were walking along Brighton beach and saw 3 whales. The best part of this sighting is that it was different because they were so close to land. They were showing their fin this time and making circles around the same area. At one point, it appeared that they were maybe just 100 feet away. They seemed playful this day.

Mello (?) Landell called to report 2 grays off Columbia Beach, S. Whidbey, at
11 am
.
