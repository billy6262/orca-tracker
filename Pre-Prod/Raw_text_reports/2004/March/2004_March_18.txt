Orca Sightings for March 18, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got home about
4 PM
and walked to the edge of the bluff (SW Camano Island) thinking, "Where oh where are the whales" as I hadn't seen them for several days. As if on cue, a gray blew! I could only positively distinguish one, who was pretty much stationary and feeding in the shallows, with lots of fluke showing.
