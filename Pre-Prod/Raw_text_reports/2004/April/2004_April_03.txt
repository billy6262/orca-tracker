Orca Sightings for April 3, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just wanted to give a belated report on a Gray, maybe two. We couldn't tell. We only seen them for about 5 seconds then they disappeared. One did give us a good fluke showing just as it dove. The Gray was spotted about a hundred yards east of the Red num. 2 buoy on the entrance channel to Oak Harbor about

3:00 PM
on Saturday. The tips of the fluke were white and the rest was a dark color.

...a grey whale spouting about 2/3 of the way from Langley to Camano. It was about
9AM
. This was our best sighting so far of a tail fluke! Wow. And what a glorious morning. Also encountered a curious seal breathing heavily as he surfaced.

Saratoga Passage between Greenbank and Camano Island saw several gray whale spouts gleaming in the sun-shine, mid-channel! It was about

9:15 am
, and the whales (2 or 3) appeared to be heading north. Puppy and I went for a walk to a neighboring bluff for a better look, and at about

9:45
saw the 3 grays heading north, a little closer to the Camano side near Cama Beach.
