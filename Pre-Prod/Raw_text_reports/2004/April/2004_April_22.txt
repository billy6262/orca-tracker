Orca Sightings for April 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 grays feeding at Mabana Shores on W. Camano from

5:00pm until
6:30pm
, moving s. slowly. 2 grays in middle of saratoga passage at
5:30pm, then they traveled to the entrance to Elger Bay. These are 2 separate pairs. The Mabana Shores Grays were one large and one considerably smaller. They stayed together feeding and moved off down the tidal flats together.

...between
9-
9:30 p.m
., TWO GRAY WHALES spent time leisurely feeding not far off the banks of the west end of First Street, (Langley) traveling slowly south. They were VERY LOUD in their breathing. While there was little light in the night sky, we could see their large dark "shadow" bodies in the water, possibly one large, one small, judging by their shapes and the volume of their breathing sounds. One was very, very loud!

...at about
9 pm
2 greys were feeding close to shore on the west end of Langley. Went went to the edge and listened to them breath. They stayed around for about 45 minutes. Seems like they are finally starting to hang out on the Langley side more.

When I saw the Gray in Saratoga Passage at

7:30 P.M
., (which was actually heading South) at one point it's head was sticking straight up out of the water, stationary. What was that about? is that spy hopping?

At

2:15 pm
, I am watching 2 grays out front of Bells Beach, about 3 miles north of Langley and slowly heading south toward Langley. There are much closer to Whidbey than Camano. Just identified one of the grays as Patch. There was a white, football shaped spot on the right side just in front of the tail.

About

3:30 PM
I spotted 2 grays between Langley and Mabana on Camano, pretty much along the Whidbey shore. Watched them for a half hour as they leisurely moved north to East Point. I was about to leave the beach, when I spotted another 2 grays just coming in sight between Sandy Point, and Pebble Beach on Camano. They were moving fairly rapidly close to the Camano shore, just off the drop off. When they reached the sandy spit off Mabana, they stopped and fed for a considerable time. By then, the two Whidbey whales were also visible mid channel between East Point and Mabana. Four whales in sight at once!

Leo Shaw of the Seattle Aquarium just called with an exciting report - Tom Schaffer of the "Good Time" sighted a
humpback off Alki Pt
, heading south in the shipping lanes
at
11:20 am
! This could be the same one that was sighted between Saturna Island & Orcas Island & heading south on
April 18th. We've had other sightings of humpbacks in Puget Sound - Ken Balcomb spotted one off the Kitsap Peninsula in
March 2 years ago, & we had one off Whidbey last July.
