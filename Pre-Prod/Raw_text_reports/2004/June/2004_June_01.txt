Orca Sightings for June 1, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I don't know if it was J-pod, but a lot of
Orcas
came by here (about a mile south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse on the west side of San Juan Island), last night about
7 PM
heading south. They must have turned around and come back.

...about
8:pm to
8:45pm
location: Point Defiance, headed north, believe to be 2
humpback
whales not traveling in any hurry, they would surface and blow several times before showing thier fluke on the longer dives lasting 5 to 8 minutes (the ones we timed. We did see 2 on the surface at once. Very dark backs and bigger than any other whale I have ever seen.

Brandon of Ferndale called to report seeing
J pod
off the west side of San Juan Island on
June 1, from about
11 am -
1:30 pm
. He had definite ID's of J26 & J2, and said the pod was really close to shore and very active.

J-pod
came south from Kellett Bluff down the west side of San Juan Island around

6:30 p.m
. Ruffles was offshore. There was some breaching and porpoising as they came south. By the time they arrived at Land Bank (south of Lime Kiln) at about

8:00 p.m
., Ruffles was trailing most of J-pod, but was close in to shore. Ruffles was babysitting at least five of the youngsters, some of whom were having fun trying to breach on him. Ruffles began to do a lazy tail slap about every 4 surfaces. He also went kelping and came up highly decorated. The calves responded by grouping tighter together with Ruffles. When the group got to the bay just before Edwards Point, 2 to 3 adult females exploded to the surface to join the group. Very interesting.
