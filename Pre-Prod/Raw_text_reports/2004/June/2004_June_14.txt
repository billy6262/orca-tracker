J Pod
was heading towards San Juan from Iceberg (Lopez), I stopped off at Cattle Point Lighthouse just in time to see J-Pod fake like they were going to head north up San Juan Channel as they passed Whale Rocks, only to swerve right next to the lighthouse and head past Salmon Bank and Eagle Point. As usual when they cross San Juan Channel, they were extremely active with lots of porpoising and breaching, tailslaps and cartwheels.

A man said he saw what he believes were
orcas
in Crescent Harbor (Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) about

10:30 a.m
. He saw a tall dorsal fin and saw a smaller animal also.

Orcas

they (J's most likely) were already heading into Rosario Strait. They were quite spread out and porpoising and there were some breaches as well!
