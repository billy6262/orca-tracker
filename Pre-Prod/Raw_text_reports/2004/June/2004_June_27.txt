Orca Sightings for June 27, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
at False Bay...Tons of vocalizations, including a couple of very deep grunting vocalizations added so much to the viewing. J's were taking their time as they moved South East. Last reports had them around Hein Bank in the evening.

Lpod
going west, left them nearing Otter Pt. in the am. Met
transients
at Race Rocks, as this is a restricted area to us, we pulled out. I did see 1 Male, 1 Female later reports from around the area indicate 1 Male 2 females but they stayed in the sanctuary, maybe T40's?
Jpod
had come to the west side in the mean time, I left them south of False Bay going South at
