Orca Sightings for June 6, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bill Evanovich today reported a large pod of orcas circumnavigating Langara Island BC (N. tip of Queen Charlotte Island), Sat. & Sun (
June 5 & 6). The pod was probably 40 - 50 whales, with at least 3 - 4 large males. He took photos which will be shared with DFO Researchers for identification.

Saw some
Ls
near Race Rocks. We emailed a photo of L78 to the Center For Whale Research which they confirmed. L67 and L101 were ID'd in the group as well. The lead whales (three or four of them) were heading north west, about 750 meters west of Race Rocks at about

6:40 pm
. We also saw about eight more whales (including L67, L78 and L101) around

6:50 PM
at Pedder Bay heading west. A spyhop and a breech ended our day.

L pod
near James Island and continued northbound in Rosario Strait well past Point Lawrence. Normally they head south in this area and continue their loop back back to the west side of San Juan Island but yesterday they were riding a huge flood tide the other direction. Tons of breaching activity from several youngsters!

We did not get out on L pod yesterday as they were way south and they showed up on a team arrival day. From the the visual i.d.'s we heard, it sounded like the same L's we had before. There was not even a rumour of K's or the missing 7 L12's except for L41 being around. However, L41's matriline (the L11's) will (and has been) disattach from the rest of L12's and travel with L57's crowd.

L-Pod
, coming back to the area after a week-long hiatus. We were near False Bay when we saw the Orcas slowly milling in a southeast direction. L41 and L57 were traveling somewhat close to each other, with most of the whales traveling in groups of 2-3. As we made our way back towards Cattle Point and home, the whales started moving across from American Camp towards Salmon Bank, and the show really got exciting! We counted 32 breaches (6 from one juvenile alone) and the group began gathering and getting more active!
