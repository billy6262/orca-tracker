Orca Sightings for June 2, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Early morning reports had orcas inbound around Discovery & Trial Island, but no ID. When we arrived on the West side of San Juan just North of False Bay, we had a positive ID of Mike, Granny, and Ruffles (

) as they worked the strong tides (there was a very big flood tide).
