Orca Sightings for June 19, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
J pod
up North
all day
. On our
morning
trip, the whales were located just north of the the Roberts Bank Coal Terminal, and we left them just north of Point Roberts. They were quite active this morning, lots of foraging and some breaches. Even J1 did a whale cartwheel, a standard breach and 2 high porpoise leaps. On our
afternoon
trip we caught up with
J pod
just west of the Cherry Point oil refinery, at Alden Bank. They were on a very slow travel southbound, still doing a little foraging, with 2 subpods resting.
