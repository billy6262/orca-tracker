Orca Sightings for June 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's & L's
about 4 miles south of American Camp as they slowly moved South (SW. San Juan Island). Then a 180 had them heading North towards Lime Kiln. They passed Lime Kiln, only to turn around to pass Lime Kiln again and headed East. As they passed the lighthouse, we observed several breaches close to shore. The direction changes kept us on our toes all day, that's for sure! Lots of breaching, lobtailing, and even a brief spotting of a "sea snake"! One of the younger whales (no ID) was spotted playing with something near the park, slowly pushing it around with his nose. Great day.
