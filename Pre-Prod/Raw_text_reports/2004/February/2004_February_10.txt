Orca Sightings for February 10, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was up late last night watching a movie when I was rewarded with a short burst of transient calls coming over the hydrophone at about 0035 in the morning. I hit record on the tape deck and ran outside but could not hear any blows. The calls sounded close though so we might have lost one of our harbor seals from the reef last night!
