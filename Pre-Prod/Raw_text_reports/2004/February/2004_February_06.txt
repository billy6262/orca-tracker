Orca Sightings for February 6, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
This morning we had a first - orcas in Silva Bay! about 16 of them. between Law Point and Commodore Pass. They stayed around for quite a while, and seemed to be towing a very unhappy sealion or similar critter. Later we heard there were two more pods coming from the other direction. Ted went out with Tom Upton, and got a few pictures.
