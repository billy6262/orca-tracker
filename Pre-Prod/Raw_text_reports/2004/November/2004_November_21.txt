Orca Sightings for November 21, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had
J and L pod
east of Race Rocks this afternoon milling. It looked as though they may have just met up as I had only seen one male in the group through the "Big Eyes" from the hilltop in the morning. Both L104 and 105 were there but no sign of any L12's. I left them headed south for Port Angeles at
1500
.

A follow up after Ron Bates called saying that
L's and J's
were at race rocks heading east. Went up to the top of Walbran park (spotting cliff) and could see some dorsals (through binocs) way on the other side just offshore from Port Angeles - moving east. I also saw a few breaches, but from where I stood, looked like some little black blobs flying out of the water...

Just wanted to let you in on the sightings we had today while working at Cama Beach on Camano Island. At around

1:30 pm
we spotted seven
orcas
, at least one baby and maybe two, heading north. They bee-lined past us and then swam in what seemed to be large circles. Then again at

3:30
we saw (likely the same pod) at least 4
orcas
heading south from the same spot.

Lots of folks were able to catch glimpses of
K pod
in Saratoga Passage today. I followed them north after they passed Greenbank, & found them as they were headed north off Onamac Pt, Camano Island at around

2:30 pm
. I watched for a bit, & suddenly there was a splash & some action, then they all turned & began heading back south down Saratoga Passage at about
2:45 or 3 pm. I followed them back south to Cama Beach at
3:30 pm, and then back home & across from the Orca Network office off Lowell Pt at
3:50 pm, at which point we started hearing really loud blows close in, of whales we couldn't see. Howie ran down to the bluff, & watched as they headed into Holmes Harbor at
4 pm
.

...at

12:45 pm
, Howie took one more look out our scope from the kitchen, & saw fins! The
orcas
are still heading northwest up Saratoga Passage, very spread out between the entrance to Holmes Harbor & Elger Bay, with some of them north of Elger Bay passing close by Lowell Pt. on Camano Island. They are too far out for us to ID yet, but it's likely K pod still around foraging on the salmon runs.

Three orcas Just passed Langley at

10:45
, I think they were two adults (females?) and the third whale looked smaller. They are traveling west closer to Whidbey than Camano. Probably the same ones that were spotted in Port Susan.
