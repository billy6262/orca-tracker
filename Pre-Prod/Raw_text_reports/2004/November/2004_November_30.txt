Orca Sightings for November 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Both KOMO 4 & KING 5 News of Seattle had great shots of the
orcas
near Seattle today. We know at least J pod was present, but from the bits of footage we saw, it seemed there were some other whales there as well, possibly K pod.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to say he saw the
orcas
on KOMO 4 news at around
noon
with footage from their chopper, & they said the whales were between Alki Pt. & Bainbridge Island, mid-channel heading south. Tom said he was able to ID J17 from the footage.

Just saw an aerial shot on King 5 news
12:10pm of the
Orcas
off Bainbridge Island, there was 4 above swimming and you could see one underneath the surface on its side looking up.

I heard from Jeff Hogan this morning that there were rumors of
whales
(orcas) down near Vashon & Bainbridge, & just got these two reports in of whales heading northward - keep your eyes peeled for them & let us know if you see them!

Did not get to see them myself but had reports of about 15
Orcas
in the North Vashon ferry run this morning. First sighting was just after

9:00 am
and had them on the Vashon side traveling south. Dock workers reported that they then passed by going North about 1/2 hour later.

Just received a message from the Seattle/ Bainbridge Ferry that a pod of
killer whales
was sighted mid channel northbound at
1040
. The RP said she saw 5+ animals but no other info was given. Cheers..
