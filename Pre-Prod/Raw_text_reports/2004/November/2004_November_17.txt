Orca Sightings for November 17, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Echolocation clicks were heard from Val Veir's west San Juan Island hydrophone at
4 pm
. - K's were still further inland, so maybe it was J pod??

I was fishing yesterday just off of Camano Head when we saw a number of
Orcas
. I tried to count, but they were all around us. There was at least ten, but probably more. There was at least one very large one with a huge dorsal fin and a few small ones that I presume were next to their mothers.

Maxine Kostelyk called back at

10:25 am
to report the
orcas
are now headed south out of Port Susan, and that there are at least 7 of them - sounds like K pod!

I found the
orcas
at

11:15
am just off Sandy Pt, Whidbey Island after they left Port Susan. They were heading south into Possession Sound at a pretty good clip, with some breaching & feeding activity. Several commercial fishing boats in the area didn't seem to bother the orcas, who were obviously after the same catch! It was a large pod of orcas, & I was pretty sure it was K pod at that point. By

11:30
they were between Gedney/Hat Island & Whidbey, still heading south amongst the fishing fleet. I headed south thinking I'd find them down by the ferry, but lost them for awhile, & discovered they had remained in the Gedney/Hat Island area for awhile. Kim Parsons & John Durbin were out in the Center for Whale Research's boat, & had headed north from Shilshole to to catch up with the whales. After seeing some hybrid porpoises on the way, they found the whales off of Gedney/Hat Island at

12:30 pm
, still heading south, but moving more slowly & feeding. They confirmed it was K pod. At 1 pm they spread out between Whidbey Island & Everett, still slowly moving south. Kim & John continued following them south through Possession Sound amongst dozens of fishing boats & nets, & I followed along watching them from land. At

1:30 pm
they were across from Glendale, close to the mainland side, at

2:30 pm
they were still close to the mainland side, across from Possession Beach Park, & heading south. I left them shortly after that. Kim called & said they left them at

3:30
south of Possession Pt, spread out and heading west toward Point No Point on the Kitsap Peninsula, but they were unable to determine whether the whales might turn south back into Puget Sound or head west out Admiralty Inlet.
Also, a gentleman I spoke to at Glendale had seen orcas south of there on Monday Nov. 15 at around 4 pm, which was likely K pod - we had an earlier sighting of orcas on Nov. 15 heading south past Lagoon Pt. w. Whidbey Island.
