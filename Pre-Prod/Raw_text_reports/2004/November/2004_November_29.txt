Orca Sightings for November 29, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Sue Zaveruha of Coupeville reporting a pod of between 6 - 10
orcas
off Partridge Pt, west Whidbey Island, NW of Coupeville at
2 pm
. She said there were 2 HUGE males, & several young ones, & they were heading south fast.
I was in Coupeville when I got the above report on our voice mail, so headed over to Ebey's Landing to take a look at

3:45 pm
. I saw about 6 orcas mid-channel, half way between Fort Worden & Fort Flagler, still heading south. I saw at least 1 adult male, but didn't have my best binoculars & it was getting dark with lots of white caps on the water.....the only way I found them was when they began doing some breaching & spy-hopping! I went down to Lagoon Pt, hoping I might be able to see them better if they were closer in, but it was so dark by the time I got there I was unable to find them. The good news is that they seem to be heading back into the inland waters, & have been showing up pretty regularly, so hopefully we'll get another chance tomorrow!
