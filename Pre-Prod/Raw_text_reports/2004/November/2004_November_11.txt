Orca Sightings for November 11, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Many
whales or porpoise
blows off Edwards Point, SJI,

9:30pm
. The fog was rolling in and it was incrediblly dark, quiet, and calm. I could not tell if the blows were from porpoise or whales. Some sounded too long and forceful to be porpoise but I did not hear any vocalizations/echolocations on the hydrophones. Plausible given J and K off Vic yesterday....
