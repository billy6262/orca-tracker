Orca Sightings for November 28, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were out sailing with
transients
, either T10s or 11s per the previous report. There was one large dorsal, two females (or juveniles) and the youngster. We counted a total of four.

Kari Koski of Soundwatch & The Whale Museum reported seeing a big
Minke
whale between Battleship & Turn Pt, heading south down Haro Strait around
2 pm
. They also saw 19 Stellar Sea Lions at Green Pt. on the northern tip of Spieden Island.

Transients
off Victoria, & a pod of orcas bouncing around the west side of Whidbey all day, but I've not had good luck catching up with them! After we received the Port Townsend report, I went out to the west side of Whidbey & spotted the
orcas
at about

1:30 pm
, VERY spread out between Port Townsend & Admiralty Head on Whidbey Island. They seemed to be going back & forth, likely foraging. They were far too distant to count or ID.
Then when the below reports came in, I headed south to see if I could find or ID them off Bush Pt. I was just south of Bush Pt. at

4:05 pm
, unfortunately the orcas were already far off in the distance, but I could see them traveling spread out & in small groups between Pt. No Point (Kitsap Peninsula) and Possession Pt. on S. Whidbey, heading SE toward Possession Pt/Sound. They were again too far off to ID, but it looked like either J or K pod, with one larger male.

Louanne Fortin called at

3:40 pm
to report a pod of 6 or more
orcas
off Skunk Bay, just south of Bush Pt., milling in small groups.
*
We got the report of
Orca
heading East from P.T. at

12:30 pm
today. We looked North from Bush Point at 2 pm and could just make out the whales blowing. We are pretty sure we saw a few spy hops and flukes once. The whales were in the the vicinity of Keystone Harbor and Fort Casey.

A large number of
transients
off Victoria this afternoon. I had at least 10 and think there were more. At least 2 kills both around
1500
, at least 1 kill was a Steller and I think the second was also. One report was T10's, T11's and friends, also a very young animal not sure which group it was with.

Just received a call from Brad West in Port Townsend, reporting a pod of at least 6 - 8
orcas
or more, 1/4 to 1/3 mile offshore, heading east toward Admiralty Inlet at

12:30 pm
. A beautiful sunny day for seeing whale spouts & fins - it sounds like they're headed in, so let us know if you see them! 1-866-ORCANET. Susan & Howie
