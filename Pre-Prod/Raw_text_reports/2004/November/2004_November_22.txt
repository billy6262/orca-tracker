Orca Sightings for November 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ralph just called and he is on the Bainbridge Island ferry (

2:30 ish
). Halfway between Seattle and Bainbridge there is a large pod of
orcas
. He can't tell which pod it is, but they are heading south.
Karen Munro
Olympia, WA

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales found the
whales
at

3:50 pm
, parallel with Alki Point, halfway out, spread out & milling. At
4:15 pm they were still between Alki Pt. and Eagle Harbor, slowly drifting southward, heading from the NW toward the SE. He was pretty sure he had spotted
J1
, so this could be J pod, not K's as earlier thought. He followed them until dark, but said they were making long dives and remained very spread out, making it hard to get ID's, but his best guess is that it was at least J pod he was seeing.
*

4:20 pm
: Approximately 4
Orcas
spotted between Blake Island and West Seattle headed south towards the West Seattle Ferry. They were spread out quite a bit.
Paul Ruppert, park ranger
Blake Island State Park
*
Pod of about 12
orcas
heading south from Clinton ferry on the Whidbey side at
noon
. Several jumping.
NB Couch

Jay Freeze of Glendale called at

12:40 pm
to report a pod of at least 12
orcas
heading south past Glendale toward Possession Pt. on S. Whidbey Island. He said they were close to Possession point by
12:40. He saw a breach & lots of foraging activity.
