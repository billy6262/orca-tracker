Orca Sightings for November 4, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Teresa Sinclair at

3:30 pm
, reporting 3
orcas
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca near Sekiu and Clallam Bay, near the Hoko River west of Kydaka Pt, heading west. She called a bit later to report there were 8 whales present, including 1 male. Her neighbor Pat Ness called again at
4:20 pm to report that there were at least 10 - 12 whales present, with 2 males and 2 calves. Some of the whales were out in the strait, others were playing in the kelp bed closer to shore. With the first report we thought it was likely a Transient orca pod, but by the last report it's sounding like it could definitely be some of our Southern Residents.
