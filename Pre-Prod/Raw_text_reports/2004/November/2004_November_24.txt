Orca Sightings for November 24, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Carolyn Mercer called at

2:10 pm
to say there was a pod of 6 - 10
orcas
in Saratoga Passage, in front of their house on North Bluff Rd, Greenbank (just down from us!). She said there was one male with a very large fin - could've been J1? They were in one spot, right in front of the house for quite awhile, then headed slowly back north.

Laurie Eger called at

2:15 pm
to report at least 10
orcas

Tom Perry of Camano Island called at

8:40 am
to report two groups of
orcas
(3 & 4) had just passed Onamac Pt. on NW Camano, heading north toward Madrona Beach, very close to shore. Don't know yet if it's J's or K's.

Mac Shearer of Greenbank just called to report the pod of
orcas
is now on the Whidbey side of Saratoga Passage, heading south past Hidden Beach (just below us!) about 100 yards offshore. He said there were at least 10, including some young ones, & there was lots of spy-hopping going on.
