Orca Sightings for September 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
...
whales
along the west side of San Juan. There were whales from South Beach to the south all the way to Bellevue Point. Mostly heading North. Talked to a couple of captains on-scene, and they told me
all 3 pods
were around again!

I started tracking
J-pod
around

10:00 a.m
. as they headed north slowly, while foraging. All three pods were moving up island very spread out. By
2:00 p.m. all three pods had moved north past Lime Kiln. I never did see
L12 or L41
, so don't know whether the L12's went north. There was a great show at Lime Kiln with about five whales hanging out at the point in the kelp for at least 30 minutes.

We had heard that the
L-12's
were off the west side but he had a hunch the rest might be doing the loop and he was right... about 78 whales all to ourselves for quite a while. The whales were pretty fluid, tightening up for a while then spreading out,
J's K's and L's
all mixing it up together. As we rounded the south end of Lopez and proceeded past Castle Rock, they all exhibited a very interesting percussive display. Almost all of them started to smack the water surface. There were pec smacks (awesome from the bulls), fluke smacks, dorsal fin smacks, backstroke with pec and tail smacks, and breaching all over the place!
