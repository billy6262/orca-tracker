All three pods
passed Limekiln light heading south tonight just
after sunset
. Reasonably good ids on L-57, J-1, L-55, and J-27. Very quiet and peaceful passby...no noticable vocalizations. A couple of tail lobs, chin ups, and some kelping.

We had
K's and L's
moving ever so slowly down Boundary Pass from Waldron towards Stuart Island. As they headed south towards Henry, the whales concentrated on several distinct rips in the current, and then they hit the brakes and logged on the surface for awhile. As we watched, L-78 decided to give us a look-see and passed very close to us. A couple of surface vocalizations were cool to hear, and as the same unidentified whale got ready to go under water, we got a small chin-up spyhop!
