4:30 pm

Forgot to mention that while we were battling the "rogue" waves, a report came in and was later confirmed that some of
L-Pod
was in San Juan Channel near the entrance to Friday Harbor! Guess they were looking for calmer waters too.
J
's & K's and some L's
were headed up Active Pass about that time of that report (Sept. 1, 2145 - the report of the whistling whale). And Speiden (J-8) definitely has a wheeze to her exhalations. Not the only one though, as I believe Ino (L-54) has a similar wheeze as well.

This is not a sighting report, but rather a hearing report. As we settled down for the evening, we heard a large
pod
going through the southern end of Active Pass around
2145
. It was dark and the moon had not yet risen so we could not see them, but the sounds of the orcas exhaling as they came to the surface was a wonderful nighttime serenade. It is difficult to say how many whales were in the group or what behaviors they exhibited (we did hear what sounded like several breaches), but one observation is notable: one of the whales had a distinct whistle which could be heard each time he or she exhaled.

(J8 is known to have a distinctive whistle or wheeze when she exhales, so maybe it was Jpod?) sb

Headed out early this morning (
9 am
) We continued, letting the ebb draw us toward Victoria. The clouds moved North and we saw some spectacular rainbows. Met
L and K pod
four miles south of Discovery Island in about a one foot chop. As we came back out through Cattle Pass there was a two foot chop and confused seas. The whales had spread out in family groups and were foraging. We watched a couple of groups off the Limekiln light, but moved North to get out of the swell that was tossing us about. Finally left them at Open Bay and headed back through Mosquito Pass.
It was a great day!

The
L's
were out and about, spread out between 2-4 miles between leaders and trailers. This meant that the boats were also very spread out, with some groups of whales by themselves. As the whales meandered from south of Discovery Island towards
Salmon Bank
, the sun came out, making the whale spotting a bit easier.
Towards the end of the day
, the waves became much bigger and without our suits, we would have been pretty miserable As the whales neared False Bay, one group of whales (or possibly one whale in that group) spy hopped eleven times!--a few of the L's decided to give us a swim-by and porpoised by the boat.
