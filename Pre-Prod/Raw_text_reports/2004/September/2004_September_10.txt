Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called in a report of a
humpback
whale traveling south past Vashon Island in Colvos Passage. His neighbors saw it go past their house.
*
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at
1:20 pm to let us know he was with a Superpod of
J, K & L's
off South Beach, south San Juan Island.
*
... on the west side of San Juan Island.
All 3 pods
were hanging around for most of the day right of South Beach/Cattle Point area. As we shut down and awaited the whales, we were fortunate enough to witness a very large mixed group of whales pass between us and another boat. As the passed, they began vocalizing so loud it was incredible! Above and below the water was just awash in squeeks and squeels, clicks and blowhole sounds! It seemed like we were in an aviary, not listening to orcas! The whales stayed in a very tight group and pretty much just made a slow move further off shore.

We had a single grey whale (
This sighting was later determined to have been of a humpback whale
) near the North end ferry dock on Vashon this morning, something I have never seen in my 26 years on Vashon. I did not see the whale myself, but the person behind me did, and the ferry captain announced it as well.
