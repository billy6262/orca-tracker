All 3 pods
seemed to be hanging out near False Bay/Eagle Point, no doubt enjoying the run of silvers coming into the area. The whales were content to do a modified West Side Shuffle as they foraged from Eagle Point up to Andrews Bay, only to turn around and head out to Hein Bank, then back towards Cattle Point up to Lime Kiln, then back down towards False Bay. As we were watching the whales this evening, we observed a female orca (sorry no ID as they were a bit too far and the sun was pretty bright, but I'd guess someone from L-Pod) with two younger calves pass the boat, only to turn around and rush through the water. Then the female came up with a fish that the two calves then pushed and shoved to get at! Gulls rushed in to try and get a sample too.
