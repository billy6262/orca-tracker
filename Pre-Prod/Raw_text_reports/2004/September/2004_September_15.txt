Orca Sightings for September 15, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Greg McCormick of the Olympic National Marine Sanctuary reported a pod of 8
orcas
, including 1 male & one young one, about 4 miles north of the mouth of the Elwha River on Wednesday
evening
.
*
...
all three pods
foraging and milling near False Bay/American Camp. They would move towards shore in fairly tight groups, only to split apart and head back several miles off the shoreline. Then turn and head back again. Lots of breaches, and a swim-by with L-67 Splash (Luna's mom), and what appeared to be little K-36 or K-37 nearby.
