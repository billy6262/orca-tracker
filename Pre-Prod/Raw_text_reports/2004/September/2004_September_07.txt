I wanted to pass along this message from a constituent in Port Angeles. Michael Anderson reports seeing a pod of 6
orca
at Freshwater Bay on 9/7 at
1300
. The pod consisted of 5 females and 1 male and were headed west according to his message.

We sighted at least two whales, one large and one smaller, on Monday,
September 6 at about
8 a.m
. They were swimming north in Admiralty Inlet in the shipping lanes between Marrowstone Island (where I live) and Whidbey Island.

These were likely the humpback whales that have been reported in the region over the past week or so. There were several reports of them from Monday in this area - how wonderful to have so many humpback sightings this year! A good resource for help in identifying whales is at: www.wildwhales.org - they have great photos, descriptions & identification tips - sb

Tom Averna found
T-22 and T-23
around Spieden Island. The locals (
So. Residents
) were coming in as well. By the afternoon, the locals were by False Bay and we got a report that four Transients and a young one were by Yellow Island, northbound. We followed them to Jones Island were they caught up with some kayakers. They hugged the shoreline and then found a seal in front of the North harbor. They took a long time to get the seal. I think they were showing the young one how to fluke bash it. In the end, it was lunch, then they came by the boat, headed back around the island and breached a couple of times. They did one more loop before heading off to Spieden.

We left Friday Harbor and began heading south when we noticed something by Shaw Island. 4
transient
Orcas foraging in a bay just south of Jones Island. We also heard that
J's and the rest of the K's
went up North while the other K's & L's went south. Just south of False Bay we watched some K's and most of L Pod slowly foraging down the west side of San Juan, heading south and east. The whales were very spread out, and vocalizing like crazy! And that big boy L-41 (Mega) breached twice. To top the day, L-94 (Calypso) went down one side of the boat, around the back, and up the other side in a very, very slow circle just below the surface. She was on her side, giving us a long look. As she passed the hydrophone, she let out a nice burst of sound in echolocations!
