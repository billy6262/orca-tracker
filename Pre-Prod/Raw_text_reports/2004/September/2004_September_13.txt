Orca Sightings for September 13, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we headed back to Friday Harbor, we heard a report that someone had spotted
J's, K's and L's
near the Coal Docks, so we continued North and hoped for the best. As we entered Boundary Pass, it was as if we were in a totally different climate as the water was absolute glassy calm, and the sun was shining. As if it was meant to be that we headed north, all 3 pods of whales were coming right towards us!

We had
J, K & most of L pod
up North this morning, in heavy seas. When we first encountered them, they were resting in the Strait of Georgia, but then turned and headed towards shore at about the same time as a ferry was leaving the Tsassawassen Ferry Terminal. They were still swimming close together, with lots of spy hopping. ...we heard that after we left, they started breaching ... alot. We left the whales at about
noon
, just off Point Roberts, southbound.

I happened to log on to OrcaLab's www.orca-live.com to see if there were any orcas
in Johnstone Strait
, & discovered a pod of
Offshore orcas
had just entered the area! Here are their reports from today's Orca-live:
Susan
"The orcas that have been coming down Blackfish Sound silently are now entering Johnstone Strait... they have just become vocal & it's now clear that they are Offshore orcas!
