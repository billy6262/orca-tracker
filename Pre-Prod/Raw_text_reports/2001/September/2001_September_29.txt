Hi Susan Well as they all went south yesterday morning, they all went north today. Out of Puget Sound early this morning and north all day, into Active Pass in the late afternoon, looked like all of them. Ron Bates MMRG

Comments:
Hi Susan, All 3 pods were back at the west side of San Juan again today, headed north. Lots of feeding and playing behaviour going on. There were close to 100 fishing boats right next to Lime Kiln so the whales were further out from shore, which made it a little nicer for the whale watchers. It was really nice to have them close to us in Everett but I know how hard it is for the others to reach them when they're down there. For everyone else's sake, I'm glad they're back up north. Cindy
