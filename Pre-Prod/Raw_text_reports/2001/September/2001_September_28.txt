Hi Susan, We got to spend a lot of time with the whales today. They led us down Admiralty Inlet and almost all the way back home. All 3 pods were present and accounted for with L12's lagging a little behind the others. We were the only boat with them for most of the time until they encountered the fishing boats, and they were very active and playful. We finally left them very spread out and foraging between Edmonds and Kingston. Hopefully they'll stay down here for a few days. It's great to have them closer to home! Cindy Hansen Mosquito Fleet

Comments:
We went to the west side of Whidbey, & were able to see the whales just south of Double Bluff around noon. They were closer to the opposite shore, so impossible to make ID's or see them closely, but we saw at least one male, & later at
12:15 as they were further south (across from Scatchet Head) there was lots of breaching & tale lobs going on. We left them at

12:45 - across from Possession Pt, where they appeared to be very close to the opposite shore, still heading south.

I'm not an expert, but three distinct groups of orcas just passed Bush Point, heading south. First group had lots of whales, pretty spread out, hard to count--but well over 12, including one large male. Second group was a few minutes behind and contained perhaps 8-10 whales, one with a larger dorsal fin. Third group was another few minutes behind the second group and had even fewer whales. I was beginning to think they'd never come down this way, though I do know that they passed by here last October, heading south. --Elsa
