Comments:
Dear Susan I just saw at least 10 whales (or porpoise) swimming about headed from ledgewood beach area towards admirals cove. They were closer to shore than they have been in the past. it is hard to tell how close since I am so high on the hill, but this time they disappeared through the trees between me and the beach. It seems that every time I see them the waters are calm and there are an unusual number of birds on the water. But make no mistake these are definately fins attached to bodies that arch out of he water and back in. The fins are black and so are the bodies for the most part, This time I was able to detect some white on the bodies because they were so close. Sharyn Mellors
