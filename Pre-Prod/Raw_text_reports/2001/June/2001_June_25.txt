No whale watch boats, and only one fishing boat traveling through. Very appreciative audience on land! Penny Stone

Orca

Direction:
southwest
Comments:
L12 subpod (L41) plus most of the L12's and a number of L25's and L57 off Victoria going S.W. The area covered was miles wide which leads me to believe Kpod was also here. This leaves Jpod as the whales coming down Rosario this afternoon. Any other sightings or ideas? Ron MMRG
