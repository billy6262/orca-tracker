Comments:

June 6th: J’s must not have gone too far north yesterday because they were south of the islands in the morning with K pod. They probably turned around at Pender or made a short loop through Active Pass around Saturna Island. We headed south of the islands today but didn’t catch up to the whales until half way up the west side of San Juan. They were headed north and we stayed with them until about Stuart Island. There were a lot of Dall’s porpoises in Haro straight today which made for a nice bonus. We even had some bowriding! ~Island Adventures

Comments:

June 5th: This was a great day, too! Our route took us through the middle of the islands to north Haro Strait where J and K pods were travelling. They had come up the westside of San Juan together in the morning. L pod was also in the area in south Haro by Discovery Island heading southwest (out the straits). L’s often come in and out of the straits, goiong from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to San Juan, then back out again this time of year. While J’s and K’s are staying right around the islands. On this trip J pod split up with K pod at north San Juan K’s headed south and J’s continued north. We followed J pod this time since there were less boats with them and had a great show! We also saw lots of other wildlife along the way including an active Bald Eagles nest on Bell Island.

east toward San Juan Island
Comments:
Captain Shane’s brother was salmon fishing in Sooke, BC (west of Victoria) when he saw whales traveling east, toward the San Juan Islands at 7 am. He alerted us first thing so we shared the info with other captains in order to track their progress. Since we don’t depart until 11 am the timing worked out pretty well. By the time we got there they were right off Discovery island and we followed them in almost to San Juan Island. L’s were making good time until they got closer to San Juan, then they slowed up and became quite social! We had a couple of great passes there at the end making for a good finale. Also saw seals, sea lion, harbor porpoises and lots of seabirds. One passenger added three birds to her life list! Island Adventures

And this in from the Canadian Gulf Islands: Hello Susan; Just had two groups (yes, I will need to learn to identify Pods), passed by just now. The first about 1.5 miles ahead consisted of at least 1 male, mother and calf. The second group may have numbered 5 and also had a large male, mother and calf. They were between South Pender and Stewart Island. Happy Sunday to you. Regards Derek Holzapfel

southeast near Lime Kiln
Comments:
K pod was still in Haro Strait, swimming southeast near Lime Kiln at 8 am. Since K’s were closer we decided to head that direction. They continued SE until south Lopez Island, then turned back NW toward San Juan at about noon. We arrived on scene as they were just south of American Camp on south San Juan Island. They were spread out and foraging most of the day. Other wildlife: Sea stars, seabirds, a baitball (school of small fish) close to the surface with birds feeding on them, California sea lion, harbor seals, harbor porpoises, and three Bald Eagles.

Comments:

June 2nd: We had a great day today! J and K pods were both on the west side of San Juan today, about half way up the island. When we arrived J pod was heading north up the island and K pod was heading south. We stuck with K’s since they were closer and we could spend more time with them. They kept swimming east, taking us about half way back to Anacortes! They seemed to be fishing, spread out in several small groups. We had a lot of close passes and one time by the new baby! He/she still has an orange tinge to the white patches. Other wildlife seen included harbor seals, oystercatchers (shorebird), bald eagles, and a California sea lion hauled out on Salmon Bank buoy.

I just saw at least 3 of them but there could be more cause they are in such a wide area much wider than my telescope. Thank you so much for the heads up. It is always such a thrill.
