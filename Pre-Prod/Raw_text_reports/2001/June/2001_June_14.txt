Thursday 14

7:15 am: Superpod (J,K and L pods) is at Lime Kiln Lighthouse and very active, putting on a major display of breachs, spyhops, tail-slaps and general rolling around. When I left them they were headed slowly north along the west side of San Juan Island. If they stay this active it should be quite a display on the live cam. Captain Tom McMillen Salish Sea Charters
