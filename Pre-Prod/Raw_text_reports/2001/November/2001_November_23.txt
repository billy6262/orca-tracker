And from Candi Emmons at the Center for Whale Research (who did a TERRIFIC slide presentation for us earlier in the week! Many thanks, Candi~):
Susan,
We had all of J and K pods except the K18s and J22s on the west side today. K34 (new calf) is still around. Js were last seen heading north off of Mitchell Bay, and we lost K pod earlier in the day. Presumably they went south.
