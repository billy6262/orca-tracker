Orca Sightings for November 16, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
First, reports & rumors of a dead whale found near Mukilteo have so far proven false. The area has been searched, & Marilyn Dalheim of NMFS just talked to the Snohomish County Sheriff who reported finding a dead seal in the area, so that most likely was the cause for the earlier report. We'll let you know if we hear anything more - Susan

And another report on J's & K's off San Juan Island, this time moving north:
Hi Susan:
Just after sunset (Friday

Entry 2:
17:30). At
18:30 they were heard on the hydrophones north of Anderws Bay- still heading North. The calls indicate J & K-Pods for sure, not sure about any Ls. There is a very noisy container ship going by at the same time that is drowning them out!
--rich.
