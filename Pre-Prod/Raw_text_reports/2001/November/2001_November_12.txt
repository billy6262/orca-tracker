Hi All
My latest info from Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales. He left L2, L67, L78, L88 and L100 6.5 miles south of Constance Bank (just so. of Victoria) at 1430 hrs. today. also in the area were L5, L58, L73 and at least 8+ whales. No L12's no L57.
No good photos of the calf obtained on this trip.
My best wishes to you all on this tragic day.
