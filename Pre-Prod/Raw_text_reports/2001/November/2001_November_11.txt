Yes! Susan, I was out with J's and K's spread out in Haro Strait as far as Speiden Channel until 1340. Jim Maya went out as I returned, and I think he went as far as Swanson Channel with them. Looked to be going toward Active Pass at the end of the day. The K baby is doing fine. Anybody have word on L67 and calf lately? ken
