Orca Sightings for November 25, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
Greetings! More whale tales this morning....first, from Kari Koski (the Whale Museum) & Doug McCutchen, who called from the Port Townsend/Keystone ferry with this report:

7:30 am, Nov. 25th
a pod of 20+ orcas seen from the Pt. Townsend/Keystone ferry, 1 male, looks like it could possibly be L pod. They were traveling North/Northwest, moving slowly & milling.

Then this report from Doug's folks in Port Townsend:
Good morning from the bluff 2 miles in Port Townsend. Kari Koski (Whale Museum) and our son Doug McCutchen called us from Whidbey to report they had watched whales from the 7 a.m. PT-Keystone ferry. We have been watching them with our binoculars - they are currently heading north west having come through Admiralty Inlet. We figured they were just traveling on by, but they have stayed in one area near the buoy for some time playing a bit - saw one breach. We were a bit groggy when Doug called, but I believe he said this was L pod.
Gus and Judy McCutchen

9:35 am Sunday - small group (10 - 12) Orcas between Ebey's Landing and Pt. Partridge (west side of Whidbey Island), but about 3-4 miles out slowly heading north.
