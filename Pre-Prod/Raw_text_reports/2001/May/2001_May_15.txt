Comments:
J-pod passed by northbound spread-out this afternoon (
May 15)with lots of echolocation clicks and occassional distinct calls... The whales have been in small matriline sub-groups each time,w/ 5-15 minute intervals between groups, lasting nearly 1 hour for the entire group to pass. The calf continues to look strong, and often is near the middle of the groups as they pass the CWR. Stay Tuned... Kelley Balcomb Bartok, Orca Conservancy & Center for Whale Research
