Comments:
Early this morning J and K pods met up on the west side of San Juan Island and headed north, up in to the Canadian Gulf Islands and through Active Pass. By the time we met up with them they were just exiting Active Pass, heading for the coal docks at Pt Roberts. J and K pods were together, resting at first. We stayed with them for a while and toward the end of our time with them they began waking and became more active. We also saw Canada Geese at Peapod Rocks, harbor seals, harbor porpoises in Georgia Strait, and an immature Bald Eagle. Island Adventures

7:00 a.m. There are Orcas on the west side of San Juan Island going north. I assume it is K Pod as they went north yesterday afternoon but came back down before dark. Some of L Pod came in from the west yesterday but went back out in the afternoon .
10:38 am J and K Pods travelling together just past Turn Point Lighthouse - heading north toward Active Pass. Bob Weimer, Orcacam Captain Tom McMillen Salish Sea Charters
