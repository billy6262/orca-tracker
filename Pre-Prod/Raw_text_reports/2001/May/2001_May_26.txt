Hi Susan; Today Sat.
May 26,
3:10 pm, approx. 4 Orcas passed by the southern tip of South Pender Island (.25 mile offshore) - mother and calve together - large male and another male? about .5 mile ahead Note: whale watching boats kept their distance nicely. That is it for now. Very exciting afternoon :-) Regards Derek
