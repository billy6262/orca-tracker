August 13th: American Camp, San Juan Island: There was a pod in the Strait of Juan de Fuca most of the afternoon, just west of Cattle Point. We counted at least 6 close to shore that we could see. Lots of activity, including breaches. There may have been others further off shore or more spread out. Deborah Houseworth
