Comments:
Hi Susan, I was on the Western Prince yesterday. It was a GREAT whale watch day. Only a few boats on the whales - all behaving themselves. Saw L's coming around Turn Pt. We saw about 15 whales. Positive ID on L57 and L58. Lots of activity for a time - breaching, spy-hopping, tail lobs and pec slaps for a moment. Then two of the groups tightened up and slept for a while. Finally, one group sort of ping-ponged and followed the other group into Boundary Pass. There was some foraging in the midst of all that. It was great to see them. Sue Miller Friday Harbor

Hi Susan, We received a report from a private whale watcher at

Susan, yesterday --saturday-- I was on the
10:45 sailing from Keystone to PT and we saw a lone whale headed north. It was large with a small dorsal fin, so I assume its either a minke or humpback. David Freed

Finally, at
11:35am today (
August 3), a group of more than 30 Orca going north passed close by Mouat Point in Swanson Channel on North Pender Island. Our hydrophone recorded a few vocalizations but the entire group were quite quiet and were likely foraging for food. Over half the group were within 15 yards of the shore line and provided a spectacular show of nature at its best from our high bank summer home. Alan Lowe
