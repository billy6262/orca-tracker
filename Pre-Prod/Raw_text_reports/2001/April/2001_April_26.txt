Here's more on J-pod from Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, & an alert to keep a lookout for J32: Dave and I watched several of the J-pod spread out northbound along the west side of San Juan Island this afternoon, and with the wind and sun glare we could only confirm 9-10 of the pod present, but they were spread out over about three miles of coastline. Last seen heading north at ~ 4pm north of the Center. I'll be back on watch and computer tommorrow... Cheers, Kelley Please let everyone know both Dave and I have not confirmed J-32 in several passes by the Center, and we ask any boats and naturalists to get a good look (preferably pictures) of the 5 year-old orphan J-32; hopefully she's hanging with J-22 and her calf J-34. At this point we would like confirmation of reports that "all are present". We have not seen her now in several passes by when conditions have been good! Cross our fingers and hope she's just fine, thanks! Kelley
