Susan, Js fished most of the morning in the False bay area then went into San Juan Channel about
1:00 and took a nap in Griffin Bay so must be fairly content. They came up and cruised by Friday Harbor about
3:00. I'm really curious who is by Shilshole. If not Transients I don't know who it could be but K or L Pod an all of J Pod was present here. Tom McMillen

Hey Susan- I took off for the west side of the island after receiving your report and found J-pod around Hannah Heights. They reversed direction and started heading south. I followed them to False Bay and then down to Eagle Cove, raced ahead to South Beach and grabbed a great vantage point up along the cliffs. The pod seemed to settle around Eagle Cove (
12:00) and then reversed direction again heading back up north again. Thanks for the updates and please keep them coming. Kerry McNulty, San Juan Island
