Tom McMillen just sent in this great account of what J pod had for lunch: Susan, Any word on the odd Orcas in South Sound yesterday? J Pod as you know cruised the West Side today. Ruffles came up by my boat with a nice Salmon in his mouth. J 17 and the two kids also were scoring good on salmon. Tom As for the mysterious orcas reported off Shilshole yesterday, we have received no other word on them, & our Seattle connections didn't catch sight of them....we'll let you know if we hear anything more - Susan
