Just came home from Easter dinner to a message that a pod of 10+ orcas passed Partridge Pt, west Whidbey Island at 7 p.m. tonight (
April 15), called in by Bill Atwater. We had stopped by the west side on the way home to look for fins, but apparently were about an hour too late!

Hi Susan- At
3:30pm today Judy, Catherine, Lynn, and I saw about 7 Orcas from Rosario Beach, Deception Pass. What a wonderful Easter present. One was male, two others looked like young Orcas, and then some females. The male came close to shore. They headed south, and one breached sideways, turning to show its underside (just having seen the film on all the different positions whales jump, I can't remember what this jump is called ! There were about 3 a little further north, and about 4 around a boat that headed south. Also, just beyond the tidepools, were 2 harbor seals, one stuck its neck way up out of the water ! A heron sat at the tidepools edge for over 1/2 hour. It was quite the day !
