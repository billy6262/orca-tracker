Susan, We saw a Gray today between D'Arcy Is. and James Is. between Sidney and Victoria. Just as I was leaving it showed its Fluke and the Whale is not either one of the two that were here most of last summer. I will try and get a good I.D. photo in the next few days to put on Orca Cam. Maybe we can keep track of some of these guys. I believe J Pod went back north last night. Dave said they never did come by the center yesterday evening. Probably see them tommorow. Tom
