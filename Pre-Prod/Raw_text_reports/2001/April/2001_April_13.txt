Susan, I was out in my kayak this evening and saw some spouting and the flukes several times. First by sandy point then about 250 yards north of Langley. I never did get very close as they were moving in a northerly direction. I would guess that they were Grey whales and that there were four of them. This was at 6 PM today. Kay Swanson
