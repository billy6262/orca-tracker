Hi Susan, I'm sure you've heard already but I just had to share too. I just got off the phone with a reporter down in Olympia and he has several sightings of 50 to 60 orcas in Case Inlet and by Anderson Island between
9:00 and
12:00. It seems that they are munching chum and hopefully they will be there tomorrow. Thanks, Rowann The Whale Museum
