Entry 5:

Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, Orca Conservancy
Location:
Sunset Pt, West San Juan Island
Species:
Orca
Pod:
L Pod
Members:
L 57, L 41 ID'd
Direction:
south
Comments:
Hi Susan, We had whales southbound along the Sunset Point (west side of San Juan Island) a little after 3 pm, but there were only L-pod memebers confirmed by Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research. He continued his observations at the Land Bank, and again at Hannah Height and Eagle Point, and it was the same group of whales the entire length of the Island. Don't know where the K-pod or J-pod were, only L-whales, including L-57 and L-41 were observed, according to Ken. It's interesting to note, that after conversations with Mark Sears just a few minutes ago, it seems the whales left Bremerton Harbor after dark and traveled all the way up Puget Sound and around the islands, passing the west side of San Juan Is. this afternoon. That is a FAST trip up the Sound!!!! Anyhow, that's what we know from here. I'd love to know where J's and K's were, if Ron or somebody can give more details, that would be awesome!!! Kelley

Mark Sears
Location:
Bremerton, WA
Species:
Orca
Pod:
L Pod, Possibly K subpod?
Members:
Direction:
west, then south
Comments:
From Bainbridge Island, they turned west, then into Rich Passage, in a tight resting pattern (most of L's & possibly K subpod). Then up to Dyes Inlet, wavered & wobbled at the entrance, to which Mark yelled "NO! NO! at the whales (these are some of the same whales that spent 30 days in Dyes Inlet in '97), then they turned south toward the ferry landing, then up to Illahee Pt., then back down to the US Navy Shipyard where he left them at dark (7ish).

Chris Dunagan of the Bremerton Sun reports an orca sighting off Bremerton - within sight of downtown Bremerton part of the afternoon, then heading south. As of
6:45 pm, they were along the west side of Bainbridge Island, headed north. Mark Sears of Seattle has been with the orcas all day getting ID's & photographs, so we will have more details for you later on who it was. Thanks to ALL of you for your great reports today! Susan

Comments:
A report phoned in by Mark Sears of Seattle: 2 pm - Eagle Harbor (near Bainbridge ferry dock), many whales moving south, FAST. It seemed to be all of L's, (L41, L57, L58 ID'd), some sprouters. There were lots of whales, so he thought possibly a K sub-pod could've been with them. (more info. on next entry)

Hi Susan. A pod of about 15 Orcas just went by Clinton headed south in Posession passage. Time,
9:45 AM. The
9:30 ferry from Mukilteo stopped for it and I'm sure got a good show of the whales performing. Kay Swanson

Comments:
I live on the east side of Whidbey, just south of Sandy Point outside of Langley (Maple Cove is the specific area) and today I saw a group of what looked to my untrained eye as Orca. I took some pictures; can you tell me if that's what they are, and if so, does this help your sighting efforts? (yes, they are orcas!) They were travelling south past Langley toward Clinton.
