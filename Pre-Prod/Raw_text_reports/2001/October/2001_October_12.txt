Hi Susan, WOW!!! Crashing waves in the afternoon glow of the setting sun; along with whale's blows lighting up like misty explosions of golden light. That's what it was like as a group of 10-15 whales passed the Land Bank, the County Park, and then the Center for Whale Research this afternoon. The whale's were backlit, though, so it was very difficult to identify them in the chop, and they stayed down for long dives between sequences of 4-5 breaths... Ken Balcomb first sighted them along the west side near Hannah Heights, and followed them up the coastline, where we got a closer look at them as they passed Sunset Point just a few moments ago (1845 end of encounter). Sorry not to identify them, but here's the report, nonetheless. Kelley Balcomb Bartok, Orca Conservancy
