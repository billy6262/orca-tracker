Orca Sightings for October 9, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:30 AM we spotted a pod of 15-18 Orcas traveling southeast from Camano Island through Saratoga Passage towards Clinton and Mukilteo. Two larger Orcas were breaching beautifully. I'm sorry we don't yet know our Orcas well enough to describe which pod they were, but in the past (earlier this year) we were told the J's were here. Jennifer & Jeff Stemes

This from a cell phone call from Ron Wilkinson aboard Clinton/Mukilteo ferry at 5PM on Monday: Pod of about 7-8 Orcas sighted from the ferry in the vicinity of Hat Island. Some breaching. Possibly heading into Saratoga Passage, but that is not confirmed. No doubt this close to the end of the island, you will get some other reports and be able to track them East or West of the island, whichever they choose. Regards, Cameron Chandler

Hi. This is Diane Clemens from Port Townsend and one of my patients today said that he saw Orcas on the ferry ride over from Edmonds (to Kingston) today around
3:00 pm. He always sits on the north side of the ferry and says that he has seen them before from there, told me to look at the southend of Whidbey. I just signed up for the list yesterday and this report came in, yay! Whatayaknow.

Since it seems your sighting network is sometimes interested in reports from farther afield than just northern Puget Sound, I will relay that in a survey we conducted this past Friday (Oct. 5th) we had about a dozen humpback whales offshore of La Push about 40 nmi as well as four of the "seasonal resident" gray whales around Cape Alava.

Susan, This is not a whale issue, but could be.... I've found two seal pups (one Monday, one Wednesday) just south of Pt. no Pt. in Hansville. Both apprear to have been shot by a small caliber rifle. I also found a large cardboard case from Winchester 22 long rifle bullets washed up nearby on Monday. I just got a call from Officer Raymond Moore at NOAA Law Enforcement (206) 526-6133. Please have anyone with further information about the seal pup shootings at Pt no Pt in Hansville Monday, 10/1/01 or Wednesday, 10/3/01 - or other mammal shooting incidents - either call Officer Moore directly or e-mail me with the information. Thank you! Joy Houghton

12-15 orcas
Direction:

Comments:
Hi Susan! Our fledgling little North Beach [Ballard] sighting community is submitting its first orca report! Albeit two days late... An estimated 12-15 orcas, three separate groups, were sighted traveling north at a high speed ["porpoising"] about 400 yards off North Beach [waterfront Ballard] at approximately 11am on Tuesday. The sighter reported approximately "five distinctly tall dorsal fins" among the animals, and about five recreational boaters chasing them aggressively. Such is often the case down here when whales show up. More bad news... the whales happen to have passed directly through a raw sewage break that happened that morning near Carkeek Park. It's a good thing they were moving fast. Our neighborhood is shoring up its sighting network as the winter orca season approaches, so we'll be a lot faster in getting these reports out!
