Here's an interesting report from Rich Osborne of the Whale Museum - anyone have any thoughts on this? Susan
Hi Susan: I just received a very interesting sighting about a large group of orcas (10-20) that were spotted off La Push on the outer Olympic coast Thursday
July 26th at around 11 AM. The person who reported it is a fisher (Clallum County MRC member- Joe Schmitt) and he definitely observed them with mackerel in their mouth. But no pictures. I'm guessing either some of L-Pod or some Offshores. Anybody else have any insights about who it might have been? Rich Osborne
