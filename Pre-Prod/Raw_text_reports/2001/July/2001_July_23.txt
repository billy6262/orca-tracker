Hi Susan A magic morning - had a few Jpod whales in the fog about 6 miles West of Hein Bank at 1144hrs, then K20 and K21 went by and in the next 15mins. the fog rolled away to reveal a superpod - J's K's and most of L's. Great vocals, spyhops and breaching. By the afternoon the fog was gone and the whales were spread from Eagle Pt. almost to Lime Kiln and out into the Strait itself (west side of San Juan Island).
