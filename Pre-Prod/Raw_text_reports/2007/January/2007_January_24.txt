Orca Sightings for January 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit (Ctr. for Whale Research) just identified a few pics given to me by my friend Carol Keiper who got them from a boat - Super Fish - off
San Fran
. Pic is of
K20
.

I talked to Dave Ellifrit who said it appeared from the photos that K pod was heading north, spread out, & a calf was with K20 (likely K38) but K 20 was the only positive ID he could get from the photos. This sighting makes it very likely that the Jan. 14th sighting we had of 20 orcas north of Santa Cruz was also K pod as they were heading south.
