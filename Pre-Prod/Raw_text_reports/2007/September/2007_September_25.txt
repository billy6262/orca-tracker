Orca Sightings for September 25, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Mallard tells a story of many
transients
south of Victoria. In the
morning
he had included T12A, T46B and T46B1 near William Head and Pedder Bay. They were feasting on common murres! After
noon
he was with the T41's, T109's (with calf), and the T46's - possibly up to 18 transients altogether. These last whales went on in to Victoria Harbor by
6 PM
., while the first group headed south fast, toward Dungeness.
