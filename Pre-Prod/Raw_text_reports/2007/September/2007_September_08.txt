Orca Sightings for September 8, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
There was a whale, probably a humpback (?), who swam into Vaughn Bay, and then out toward Rocky Bay, near the north end of Case Inlet, southern Puget Sound. We saw the whale blow a couple of times, and his back came out of the water a couple of other times. Gordon Dona saw him closest, and thought it was a humpback. The spout was more like a spray, looking like a symmetrical tree. There was no dorsal fin (
this sounds more like a gray whale than a humpback ?- sb
). The whale was inside Vaughn Bay at about 5 pm, and left about 630 pm. The last sighting was of the whale rounding the northern point outside Vaughn Bay, and heading north.

We received a call from Davis Hyslop, who was on the Sidney-Anacortes 6 pm ferry, about 30 minutes from leaving the dock he said 2
orcas
surfaced immediately in front of the bow of the ferry, about 10 yards in front of it, heading north. He was concerned because of the speed of the ferry & the close distance of the whales. He said he heard a noise on the port side of the ferry, & went to the back to watch for the whales. He said he saw one surface after the ferry had passed by, but not the other, though he watched for quite awhile. If anyone else was on that same ferry, or observed this, please send any further details you might have.
Orcas can be pretty quick & stealthy, so it's very possible they dove under, but the 2nd orca didn't come up for awhile - but we thought it important to get this info. out there in case anyone else witnessed this or has further info. sb.

We received a call from Pat Ness at Chito Beach Resort, but instead of her usual cheery humpback and gray whale reports, she relayed the news that Makah Tribal members had shot a
Resident Gray
whale about 12 miles west of Seiku, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
