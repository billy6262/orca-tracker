Did anyone else hear/see anything large and beathing in Saratoga passage Thursday nite?? I thought I'd heard a blow about 6ish as I was walking the dog down to the beach - but passed it off as someone dropping a sheet of plywood in their driveway over on the Camano side, then at
7:30 on the dot; and big "blow", I looked up and saw a 50 to 60 foot "disturbance" off of Eastpoint as if a gray or something equally as large had just plowed the surface. Raced into the house & grabbed the camera; set it on "night mode" - and waited - 15 - 20 minutes - nothing. Has anyone else seen/heard anything out there tonite?
