Orca Sightings for September 22, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the
11am
trip we caught up with
K's and the rest of L pod
north of Constance Bank. It was rough out on the water and the whales were fastly moving east. I only got a possible ID on L73, Flash.

K's & L's
showed up today on the west side of San Juan Island. I wasn't out today, but did manage to see a few whales from shore while running back and forth to town!

LOTS of
Orcas
. I understand it is
L-pod
and
K-pod
from Jim Maya, who was out there with them just below the inn when I called him this
afternoon
. They were spread out and "foraging".

While visiting a friend on North Bluff Rd, I heard two definite blows. This was around

2:30pm
. They sounded close to the Whidbey side-We looked but never saw anyone.

This is In regard to David Day's inquiry regarding possible whale blow sounds he heard on Thursday night. There have been a couple of
Grays
in Saratoga Passage, in our vicinity, for the last
seven to ten days
. I have had a couple of visuals and heard several aural contacts on quiet nights during that time. On the visuals, they were near shore at the mooring buoy line on one occasion and about a quarter mile offshore on the other. Both times they were heading southeast towards Cama Point which is about a mile away from us. One seems to be much larger than its companion.

From our house just south of Mabana on Camano, I also saw/heard something large and breathing about the same time. We had just gotten home shortly before
7 PM
and I glanced out our window. The water was glassy calm and the light was such that I could see a "rough spot" out on Saratoga passage. It was not wind touching down, as there was no wind. I looked again with the binocs and saw it was a large school of fish with fins breaking the glassy water. My guess is adult salmon, but they could possibly have been dogfish, but I don't think dogfish would have been in such a large school. As I continued to watch, it looked like a school of small black and white dolphin/porpoise were feeding on the fish. I had also been hearing breathing. I scanned further north on Saratoga Passage and noted at least 3 more "rough spots". While I was scanning one of these "rough spots"( I'm assuming another school of fish), suddenly 2 very large dark shapes came up to the surface in the middle of the school. They did not have noticeable fins on their backs, and they did not appear to roll, but came straight up, then sunk back down. They definitely were not Orca. The grey whales are not around this time of year, and they would not be eating fish anyway, so I ruled them out, but that was the thought that came to mind because of the size. I'm not familiar with the minke so can't compare. I'd love to know what I saw!
