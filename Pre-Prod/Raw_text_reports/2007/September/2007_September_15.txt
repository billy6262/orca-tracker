Orca Sightings for September 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went out on the Western Prince II, the undisputed stars of our tour were none other than the magnificent and handsome
orcas
, whom we saw south west of Cattle Point Lighthouse. We saw
J pod
in its entirety as well as the
L2's
most of whom were engaged in some mighty good romping, treating us to breaches, pec slaps, spy hops and vigorous lob tailing. The wild grace of these animals had each and every one of us aboard in a state of rapt wonderment. We hardly dared to breath or blink. At one point, I believe a
Minke
was spotted and observed, but by that time I only had eyes for the whales. Firstly, was the unmistakable and stately, marcelled dorsal fin of J1 (Ruffles). The anticipation of where we'd see his proud and powerful fin, break the surface and shark through the water was half the thrill. I also saw L78 (Gaia) and J2 (Granny) swimming together quite playfully. At one point, L78 was swimming on his side quite close to J2 as was clear by the fact that his dorsal fin was moving parallel to the water's surface in lieu of perpendicular. It makes me giddy to think that perhaps these two are in the thick of a romance of some sort perhaps not unlike that between K21 (Cappuccino) and L2 (Grace) as appears on the Orca Network website photo- documented by Chantelle Tucker. Excitingly, as we were revving up to head back to the docks, Captain Ivan pointed out J16 (Slick) and her offspring including J33 (Keet), J36 (Alki) and precious J42, swimming in a tight formation off our stern with the exception of J26 (Mike) who was a short distance away from his subgroup but still traveling abreast. I was able to (at long last!) get a really good look at J42 as she was practically jumping out of the water in an effort to take a nice deep breadth. The naturalists on board (thank you Monica and Chris!) taught us that calves will do this in order to avoid getting water in their lungs as they take a breadth. In evidence was J42's splotchy skin described as normal and seen in a photo on the Center For Whale Research's website.

Wake up calls from Lime Kiln! At
8.30am
I heard some soft far-away calls. Definately J's. I know part of L's were with them yesterday, but I didn't hear them this morning. They started foraging around 8.37am until a plane flew by and the clicking stopped. At 8.43am they resumed their soft whistles.
A happy Ly, Orca enthousiast

There have been
humpbacks
this
morning
- still out there at
noon
- two humpbacks have gone back and forth from Shipwreck point to the west of us, to the feeding spot to the east of Chito Point. We've had whales during this week also, however, I didn't identify which kind.
