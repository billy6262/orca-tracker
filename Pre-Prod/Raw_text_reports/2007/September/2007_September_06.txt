Orca Sightings for September 6, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Seemed like all of
Js, Ks and Ls
were in. We had a bit of foraging from J-pod
early
in the day (and collected two prey samples), but most of the rest of the day the whales spent socializing. Our "fluke- print" follows were quite productive for collecting fecal samples, a total of 12 throughout the day (most from Ls). We left the whales yesterday evening south of Salmon Bank, spread out over at least 4-6 miles, most of them heading south.
