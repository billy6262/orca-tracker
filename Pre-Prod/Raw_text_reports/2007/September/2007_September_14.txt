Orca Sightings for September 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on a private boat tour and we sailed down Haro Strait to the south end of San Juan Island, with the end of the ebbing tide. As we rounded Edwards Point, we could see countless boats. I then saw fins about a mile to the east of us, heading west. North of Pile Point at about
1pm
, we were treated to the sight of the unmistakable dorsal fin of
J-1
, Ruffles, by himself, in the lead of
J-pod
heading toward Lime Kiln Point. J- Pod seemed to be in small family groups, in a fairly slow traveling mode. I did deploy my hydrophone and hearing vocalizations was ice cream on the cake! After J-Pod passed, we started seeing small groups of
L- Pod
, I was able to ID J-57, Faith. They seemed to be in more of a foraging mode, as the small groups made directional changes and tacked back & forth to the shore & out. We even heard echolocation clicks on the hydrophone from L-Pod!! Eventually, L-57 turned around and headed back east, toward the other L-Pod groups. As some L-Pod groups foraged in False & Kanaka Bay, near shore, it looked like there was a playful group of juveniles just ahead of some adults, as they started spy hopping, breaching, cartwheeling, head standing, and a few tail slaps! Meanwhile, J-Pod had turned and headed south & west. It was now about

3:30pm
, J-Pod was miles to the SW of us, L- pod was east of us spread from False Bay to offshore. We headed north, elated to have seen and heard close to 60 killer whales!
