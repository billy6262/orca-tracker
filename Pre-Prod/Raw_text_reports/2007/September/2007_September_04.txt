Orca Sightings for September 4, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

4:30PM
, we were privileged to observe
transient orcas
in the wild, always a remarkable experience. We caught up with the T-19's and the T-100's in Trincomali Channel, between Saltspring and Galiano Islands, just above Active Pass. As the BC ferries steamed past, the T-19's began lunging, a harbor seal in their midst, joined by the T-100's as they made the kill under water. Afterwards, they were slowly traveling south along Prevost Island, all of them breaching and socializing. One passenger called it "celebrating"--and I would have to agree.

We then ventured out to see
J-pod
coming across Haro. The whales seemed so peaceful and relaxed. The decrease in numbers of boats was a nice change. We watched a group of six to eight whales slowly make their way towards San Juan. They did some great spyhops, lots of tactile behavior, lifting each other up, tail slaps, and a few breaches. The lighting was incredible as the sun made its way through the hazy fog. We had some great vocalizations as well. I am really looking forward to the rest of September.

We saw a blow in Liberty Bay about
1700
this evening just off of Keyport! (Kitsap Peninsula/Poulsbo area) I called everyone to port and sure enough, two more blows were witnessed by all hands! This was a
small, solitary, dark whale with no noticeable dorsal and no tail display on diving - Minke?
(we were far enough past and going in opposite directions that it might have had a dorsal fin that we couldn't see. Three of us have a lot of sea time and a fair amount of whale experience, and I'm willing to bet that it wasn't a grey). Capt Steve saw what he thought was a small whale in approximately the same location last week from the flying bridge but no one else witnessed it then, and haven't heard any other reports.
