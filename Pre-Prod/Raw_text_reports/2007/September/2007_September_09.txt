Orca Sightings for September 9, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Center for Whale Research senior staff-member Dave Ellifrit began an encounter at

2:30 pm
with members of
J-pod
off Kellett Bluff, Henry Island. The whales were traveling northbound, with groups and individuals spread out over several miles. The whales continued north into Swanson Channel, where Dave left them at

3:58 pm
and returned to Snug Harbor.

We were over on the west side of San Juan Island and as you know so were many
Orcas
.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research was able to ID the pod of
Transients
reported off Lopez Island & Anacortes as: "T124D, T90 and possible T100. These three groups would add up to nine."

About

5:30pm
about 2 miles off shore of San Juan Island, we had a superpod. You can see a mating sequence here. K21 (Cappuccino) lifts L2's (Grace) belly out of the water with his pectoral fin then he lays on his side and then she rolls over on her side as he rolls under the surface and we don't see him, one can only assume what is going on. After this, they go on their way breaching. There was a third individual on scene with them L88 (not seen in the composite) - an offspring of L2.

This evening (
1600-1900
) we had members of
all three pods
traveling in close groups up Boundary Pass and into the Strait of Georgia. We left them 2 miles North of East Point pointed for Point Roberts.

We discovered
all 3 pods
of Southern Residents arrived on the west side of San Juan Island early this morning right off the Salmon Bank marker. We did confirm that L41 Mega was traveling near L67 Splash, and also saw J27 Blackberry. By the time our afternoon trip came around, the lead whales of J & K Pods were just passing the Turn Point Lighthouse still heading north. And for only the second time in 11 years of watching SRKW's, I saw a female (ID unknown) come to the surface about 1/4 mile from our boat, and do what I can only describe as "high speed tailslaps." Not one or two or three, but 12-15 in quick whacks, as fast as you can clap your hands. The last time I saw this was when J2 Granny did it about 5 years ago, and we noticed J1 turn around immediately and return to mom's side. This time the nearest whale began breaching repeatedly. We did have quite the mix of whales with J's confirmed, K's passing off in the distance, and nice passes with L57 Faith and J1 Ruffles. The "old fella" was taking his sweet time working a current line, as he went maybe 100 yards in a 10 minute period. We left the whales near the Pender Bluffs, and they were undecided as to which way they wanted to go.

We saw many
orcas
off and around Lime Kiln, San Juan island in different locations in the area, for about an hour and a half in the
early afternoon
. Saw behaviors like spy-hopping and tail slapping. We also saw a mother and young calf fairly close. Puzzled by one solitary whale we saw several times. A transient? For quite a while he/ she was travelling horizontally just below the surface with his /her dorsal fin exposed.

We got a distant view of some
orcas
as our ferry approached the Anacortes dock. About

1:20pm
there were a handful of orcas travelling rapidly NE from the area off Washington Park toward the area due north of the Anacortes ferry dock.

T's
were seen at the south end of Lopez Island yesterday, around
noon
. We caught up with them near Lopez as they headed towards Fidalgo Island. We stayed with them for over an hour, then they headed north towards Bellingham Bay. I estimated 10 all together, but couldn't figure out who they were. There was a calf with them, beyond the pink stage.

I heard a few
orca
calls on OrcaSound's Lime Kiln hydrophone at

4:45 pm
& a few more on the OrcaSound hydrophone, a bit further north on W. San Juan Island, at
5pm
.

9:20 am
a tight group of 7 or 8
orcas
went past the south end of Lopez from west to east very fast. Another two or three orcas were separate but following the same travel pattern.
