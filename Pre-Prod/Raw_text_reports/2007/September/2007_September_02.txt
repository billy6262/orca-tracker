My husband saw a
gray whale
feeding in shallow water in Crescent Bay near Port Angeles.
Brian & Sharon Holland, Port Angeles, WA
*
I saw five or six
orcas
in the
morning
very close to the east shore of Saanich Inlet, just north of Coles Bay and Dyer Rocks. It looked like one older male (very tall slender dorsal fin which wobbled quite noticeably). Two small whales, one sticking very close to the side of the adult, calf -like behaviour. And some grey saddle patches. ...
Susan, in North Saanich

I saw one
gray
whale, about 50 feet off the east shore of Maury Island, just north of Point Robinson (So of Seattle) traveling South along the shoreline, about
3 p.m.
It came to the surface a couple of times, then flipped its tail in the air and was gone.

There is a
humpback
out there at this minute.....

6:00 pm
, feeding in the 'spot' immediately east of Chito Point. He has circled deep into the kelp beds also, and has been out there most of the day.

Orcas visit Bellingham Bay
SERGE GIACHETTI, THE BELLINGHAM HERALD
A pod of
Orcas
swim in Bellingham Bay near Lummi Island Sunday afternoon. A rare spectacle in this area, the transient pod was seen swimming in and out of Bellingham Bay all afternoon. According to John Pedlow, seeing the Orcas was a rare spectacle in this area. The whales approached within fifty feet of his boat. Onlookers reported seeing the whales hunt and catch a harbor seal near Eliza Island. As opposed to resident pods, transient Orcas' diets consist almost exclusively of marine animals rather than fish. Because transient Orcas travel on extremely unpredictable routes, they are difficult to track and study.

On the Island Caper we had such an amazing time with the
transient
orcas. Regarding how late they were in the bay: I was out in my kayak today and had a conversation with another kayaker. He told me that he was sailing with friends yesterday when they encountered the transients, including the large male (T-20?) near Eliza Island at around
4PM
. That would seem to coincide with our sighting them a bit later and farther north on our return trip. He told me that he and his friends kept the group under observation until almost

8:30PM
, when it got too dark to do so any longer. He said that the orcas had by then rounded Portage Island and were heading north in Hale Passage.

We were leaving Bellingham Bay for our whale watching tour on the M/V Island Caper, when we encountered dorsal fins in Bellingham Bay. Just before Carter Point we ran across
transients
. I counted 11 and the M/V Mystic Sea who were way off of out starboard said they saw 18 to 20. The only positive ID was T20. The rest were females, juveniles, and a "pinkie". They headed into Bellingham Bay to within one mile off of the cement plant. They were breaching, tail lobbing, cartwheeling, and generally just cavorting around like residents. I watched two juveniles porpoise and then dive on a small flock of common murres. Then a dead murre floated by the boat. They spent the entire day in the bay from

10:45 to
18:45
, when we had to go back.

When going out with Island Mariner, we were amazed to see a group of
Transients
headed toward Bellingham Bay (spotted off of Chuckanut Bay). Our vessel turned and followed them, only to observe them for a little over 3 hours. The captain had called another whale watch vessel (based in Anacortes), and they came to Bellingham to enjoy this incredible event. There were an estimate of
30 orcas
(Please check with the naturalist for Island Mariner for more specifics) , but I believe one of the Transients was T20. There were a number of juveniles and also a "pinky". They were exhibiting a number of activities, including: breaching, tail slapping, pec slapping, and rolling on their backs. At times, several animals split from the group and were investigating different areas of the bay. There was even a group that headed toward the old cement plant, venturing into about 60 feet of water. At this point, they were only several miles from the mouth of the Nooksack River! The naturalist stated that orcas were not spotted in the bay since 1952, so this was highly unusual. After the 3 hours of observation, the Mariner went out to do some sightseeing at the other islands. We returned to Bellingham Bay about two hours later to find the Transients still there. Their activity was slowed considerably from earlier, as they were slowly swimming around, heading south and west out of the bay. The naturalist surmised that they had feasted quite well (there are/were many Harbor seals in the bay), and were going into a sleeping mode. We did not witness any seal tossing, but did see on several instances an orca break into a dive. There were a lot of pleasure craft on the water, and unfortunately there were instances of the boats coming too close to the whales. I would like to say that they were ignorant of the rules that pertain to prudent whale watching, but when you see 2 whale watch boats in the vicinity, going very close to both does not make sense.
