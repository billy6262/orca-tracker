Orca Sightings for July 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were camped at Sand Point on the Olympic Park Coastal Strip on
July 27, 28 and 29. We spent a lot of time up on the "hill" at the end of the point with binoculars and a scope. We saw a
Gray Whale
feeding just off the kelp line southwest of the point all three days. I think it was the same individual, possibly the same individual we saw in June in the same place.

He's back! This large
Grey whale
with the white patch is back. His body is almost tan brown in color. He was feeding back and forth between Chito Point and the mouth of the Sekiu river, from Saturday evening (
8 pm
), through all day yesterday, 7/29, with sightings from 8 am - 9 pm. This is the same whale that was sighted here June, July '06, April '07 and this summer. We also had a
humpback
come by west to east between

7:30 -
8:30 pm
. When this whale approached the area of the feeding gray, it disappeared off the radar screen - must have gone into stealth mode!
