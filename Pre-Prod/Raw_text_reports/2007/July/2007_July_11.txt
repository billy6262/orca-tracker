Orca Sightings for July 11, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
These (photos) just came to me today (see photo at right). 3 adult
orcas
and a calf at Sea Lion Caves. No sea lions seen taken. They were in the area for about one hour.

The Whale Museum relayed a report they received of a
gray whale
(or two) in north Saratoga Passage off Polnell Pt. between Whidbey and Camano Islands
in the evening
. The woman said she thought she saw two whales. Perhaps this is the gray(s) that has been sighted 3 times now this past week in the area.

The
orcas
were a long ways off at Point Roberts at around

4:00 P.M.
They were spread out between one to five miles apart. The water was choppy and they were barely surfacing. We were told it was
J and L pod
.
