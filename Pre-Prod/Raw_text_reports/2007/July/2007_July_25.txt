Saw nine
orcas
off Lime Kiln Park at

5:30pm
, traveling north had come from False Bay, did not come in close enough to shore to see markings, did not appear to be any male dorsal fins in evidence, one fin seemed quite small maybe a youngster, volunteer at park said she had phone call identifying them as Lpod, they seemed to be lazily swimming north, two breachings.

Around

6:30PM
we spotted around 15
Orcas
heading south just below Lime Kiln (w. San Juan Island). Not much play at first but then they began breaching and tail slapping. After they turned the bend we headed down to American Camp to see if we could catch them there. Just as we arrived we could see them coming down the coast line. There was still a lot of breaching and there appeared to be anywhere from 15-25 Orcas. They calmed down quite a bit and disappeared for the most part under the water with just a few dorsal fins popping up every once in a while.

Finally some squeaks and squeals again on the Lime Kiln hydrophone at

6:50 pm
! At 6.30pm I heard some soft calls on OrcaSound (NW SJI), but now they're all over on Lime Kiln. It's 7pm and the calls on Lime Kiln have faded. Instead, they're back loud and clear on OrcaSound! This time, more clicks and less squeeking. It's past midnight (

12:56 am
), but the orcas woke me up once again! OrcaSound hydrophone, lots of squeeks, no clicks.
Ly in awe, ready to fall asleep in the midst of orcas..
