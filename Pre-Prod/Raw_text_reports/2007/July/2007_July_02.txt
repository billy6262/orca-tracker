Orca Sightings for July 2, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
Jpod
moving past Race Rocks into Juan de Fuca Srait, giving everyone an epic view of the family who swam closely together and at times in a resting line. This
afternoon Lpod
came in from the west but I didn't see all of the L's perhaps half. We caught them as they were heading towards Race Rocks and then also into the Juan de Fuca Strait as they passed a few miles from the Victoria waterfront. Lots of active behavior including breaches, porpoising, cartwheeling, spyhopping, tail slapping and more. Lots of big boys in the group today. Including Flash L73 who is resembling Ruffles J1 !

J's and L's
off of the west side (San Juan Island)
tonight
. It was so fun to watch them in feeding, breaching, rubbing on each other and lots of tail slaps. There were a few spy hops too. I can just imagine the chorus of vocalizations that must have been going on under water. We had a great sighting with a small group (4 whales) that came in close to shore. We were up the hill at Hannah Heights but at times could see them underwater as they went back and forth in a tight group. J26, Mike was the sprouter in the group. We thought he would be with other J's, but we kept hearing a whistle like sound at the end of one of the whales blows. As they got closer to shore I knew it was not J8, Speiden, and the only other whale I knew with a wheezy sounding blow is L54, Ino. I finally went back to my car to get the ID chart and sure enough that was who it was. The other two whales were probably her calves.

J-Pod
came back in today after almost leaving out the Straits. And reports of
L-Pod
at Constance bank coming in as well!
K-Pod
IS coming back in...they are just taking the long way around to get here, having been spotted with other L-Pod whales in Johnstone Strait. It was good to watch J's take advantage of the strong flood tide today. They came across Haro and as they hit the mid channel currents, they began a lot of breaching, spyhopping, lunging and perhaps some foraging as we noticed multiple quick direction changes.

We had a call from Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales this afternoon -he heard word on the radio of possible
K pod
sightings up north. We later had word from the Center for Whale Research that K pod had been sighted by Stubb's Whale Watching in Blackfish Sound, then a report on OrcaLive that K's were in Johnstone Strait - finally, they are hopefully on their way back to meet up with J & L pods!!

17:37:44 PDT
We had
southern residents
today. They came from the north, one group went through weynton, other group passed in front of orcalab (Hanson Island, N. Vancouver Island). they were very vocal and sounds like all headed east.

Just got off the phone with Mary Borrowman (Stubbs Island Whale Watching) who reports what look to be
K-pod
southbound in Johnstone Strait. The call just came in
(
2:45 p.m.
) and the report is of 20+ whales - with what looks to be a fairly confident ID on K40, and what might be K7 - just north of Malcolm Island, heading into Blackfish Sound. This is likely to be K-pod, passing through Johnstone Strait prior to the heavy activity by the Northern residents, and they should be passing OrcaLab any time now.
