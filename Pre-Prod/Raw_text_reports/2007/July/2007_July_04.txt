About

4:45 this afternoon
we just caught a glimpse of 2-3 whales (
orcas
) rocketing by on the fast running tide in Active Pass. They were heading east. We don't know if there were more ahead of the ones we saw. A brief sighting is better than none at all!

1200-1345pm
this afternoon aboard Serengeti with glass seas in the Straight of Georgia we had
J, L pod
travelling South toward Alden Bank pointed for Rosario. Presumably upon hearing
K pod
approaching from the North at 9 kts J's/L's swung around and began swimming North at high speed. All three Pods met up approximately 6 miles North of East Point (Saturna island) at

12:38 pm
while having a greeting ceremony, breaching, very acoustic.

From the word I hear,
J's, K's and L's
have met up in the Strait of Georgia. WOOHOO! I'll head up later this afternoon. Also heard that
L11's
were south of San Juan. Whale-O-Rama!
