Orca Sightings for July 8, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
J's & K's
heading north past Battleship Island around

11:00 AM
. Then in the afternoon,
L Pod
came in from Discovery Island, and decided to do things differently by using both Rosario AND San Juan Channel to head north.

My first sighting of Ks this year - we had
Js and Ks
between Stuart and Henry Islands in the morning (heading north) and they basically took us "home" on our way back to Vancouver. We left them at about
6.30 pm
at Richmond Airport still heading north. Ruffles did his usual thing travelling about half a mile out from everyone else, his blows beautifully illuminated by the early evening light. We did observe some foraging, but in general the whales were heading leisurely north. They must have had a good feast, because we had K26 Lobo lazily laying at the surface for a very long time, rolling around, waving his pecs, doing lazy taillobs and just giving the impression of a happy playful young orca with a full belly. Also clearly id'd was K21 Cappuccino.
