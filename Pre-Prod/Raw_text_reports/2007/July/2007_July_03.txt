Orca Sightings for July 3, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary had a sighting of 11-12
killer whales
off Pt. Grenville (between Kalaloch & Moclips). Annie Douglas from Cascadia sent photos of a couple of the individuals; one whale present is CA10, identified from the California/Mexico catalog published by Nancy Black and others in 1997. Nancy confirmed the ID of this individual, he now has a new nick lower down on the fin as well. CA10 isn't in the Ford and Ellis guide or the Center's transient guide - not sure if he has been seen off Washington or further north before?

We traveled to north Pender Island where
Lpod
was in a group / resting traveling formation. I assume they were reserving much of their energy for the high energy leap across the Georgia Strait towards the mouth of the Fraser River where
Jpod
was apparently already making their way. Flash / L73 is such a big boy and easy to spot animal in the group, even from great distances.

The Center for Whale Research had
J pod
& some of L pod pass by the Center on the west side of San Juan Island in the early
morning
, looks like they were heading north from the video on the CWR Website.
