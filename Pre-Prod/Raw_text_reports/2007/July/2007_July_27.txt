We were camped at Sand Point on the Olympic Park Coastal Strip on
July 27, 28 and 29. We spent a lot of time up on the "hill" at the end of the point with binoculars and a scope. We saw a
Gray Whale
feeding just off the kelp line southwest of the point all three days. I think it was the same individual, possibly the same individual we saw in June in the same place.

Orcas
at

9:30am
off East Point, Saturna Island, travelling west through Boundary Pass, spread out in roughly four groups. One of my neighbors put their numbers at 40+. A few of the younger Orcas seemed to have a lot of energy to expend, and did so by continuously breaching on their way towards Turn Point. As with a similar sighting reported earlier this month, when passing East Point, about 10 of the Orcas come very close to shore, breaching, fin and tail slapping, a few turning back for a short distance, then vector out into the pass to join the rest of the group who have remained well off shore. By
10:15am, the last of them had passed Monarch Head.
