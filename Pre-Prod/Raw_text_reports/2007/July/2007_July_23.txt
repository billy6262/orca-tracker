Orca Sightings for July 23, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Humpbacks
south of Victoria, down toward Pt. Angeles, breaching. Pretty darn spectacular.
Capt. Jim, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island

We rceived a call from Donna at Olson's Resort in Seiku - she relayed this report from a Seiku fisherman. He heard from another fisherman that the
orcas
were in the Strait of Juan de Fuca off Seiku.

I was fishing this
morning
at Keystone in front of the Rake station (west/central Whidbey Isl) about
6 AM
when just 25 feet off shore and 25 feet east of where I was standing at the water's edge a
gray whale
came to the surface and submerged again. It was foggy so that when it surfaced twice more down the beach toward the ferry landing (heading NW) I couldn't see it. Another fisherman said that he had seen something off shore in the same area yesterday that may have been a whale. I didn't catch a salmon, but the whale certainly made it worthwhile to get up early.
