Orca Sightings for July 6, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

9:00am
a pod of about 12- 15
Orcas
made a pass by East Point on Saturna Island, heading West. They were fairly restrained - no breaching, just travelling - no whale watching boats either, which is nice, at least until they made Skipjack Island in Boundary Pass. Around Monarch Head, when the boat numbers reached about 8, the Orcas went under and disappeared.

Off of the west side of San Juan Island near False Bay I encountered
all three pods
(according to Soundwatch). They were headed in a southwesterly direction. There was breaching, tailslapping, and porpoising. I've attached a photo of one of the whales that I saw. It's the only one that I got a saddle patch of though. I missed the patch of the one that swam right next to our boat.
