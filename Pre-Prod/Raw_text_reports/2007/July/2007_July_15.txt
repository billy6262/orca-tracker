Orca Sightings for July 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had about 10
orcas
heading west in Boundary Pass off Saturna Island, making Monarch Head at 12
noon
, trailed by twice as many whale watch and pleasure boats. A few spy hops, but otherwise just travelling.

J pod
in Active Pass, with calf J42 being very active.

We have a report from Depoe Bay fishermen - 10
Orcas
seen 20 miles offshore, northbound,
2pm
. Fishermen were out in warmer current fishing for tuna. Orcas came right around them, either side of the boat and continued north.

My Buddy and I were off Eureka this afternoon and ran into a pod of what I think might be "False Killers" at N4046.927/W12417.794 GPS. Looked like the big one was pushing 18'. They numbered between 5 to 7. They busted out all around us while we were in the silver salmon. We and they were following the upcurrent side of a raft of sea grass about a mile long that was strung out E/W. I think WT was about 58. They were definitely eating salmon. Have seen Orca in this area quite a few times over the years, and these animals didn't look like Orcas down the sides. Something was off on the shape of the bodies too. Have fuzzy photos if you want them ( see above ). I took these photos after an initial under 50yd. encounter with the largest of the group. He was traveling from my left to right and was exposed on the top of a swell, almost to the bottom of his belly. I observed no saddle patch, eye patch or throat patch. No white near belly and color was not the deep black with the shine I have seen on Orca before.

Reaction to Jim James photo (Eureka, CA,
July 15): I'm almost positive that these are Risso's dolphins (see illustration). The dorsal fins are too tall for false killer whales. Uko Gorter - They are not Pseudorca, the fin is definitely too tall relative to the width. I agree with Uko, based on fin height relative to body size they are most likely Risso's.

A small pod of [
orcas
] going quickly with the tide eastward through Active Pass at about

4:30 pm
today. A few breaches, some side swimming and pec fin slapping, some tail slaps. The whales were more in the middle of the pass instead close by our rocks and moving so fast that I am not sure my photos have enough for id's.

Orcas

7:30 AM
