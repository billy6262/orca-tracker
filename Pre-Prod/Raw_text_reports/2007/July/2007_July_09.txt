============================================================

Entry 1:
Ralph Munro reported to us last night that he had seen a

A superpod of
Southern Residents
visited Saturna Island travelling west in Boundary Pass this morning. The leaders reached Monarch Head at

9:35am
, the laggards not until
10:15. Roughly 25-30 Orcas, possibly more, travelling in small groups of 3-6 stretching out in a long procession. Notable were a group of three Orcas, a mature male travelling tight with two smaller ones, fin slapping, tail slapping and breaching, including a spectacular coordinated triple breach.

We had about a dozen
orcas
, dispersed into groups of 2-4, travelling west to east again head past about

10:45-
11:00am
. There was a fair amount of tail slapping and some breaching, but that didn't seem to slow them down much as they motored off on their errands.

We had the
L-5's
reported by themselves down near False Bay. A report of
K's
joining the L-5's came over the radio. And then a late report of all the
rest of L-Pod
heading up Rosario Channel. Just as we came out of Thatcher Pass, we saw whales on the east side of Rosario. The L's were in a couple of large groups, and it was so incredibly beautiful to see 15+ whales surface at the same time. They were moving very slowly (but not quite a resting pattern), and the sound of multiple blows was so nice to hear. Then after about 20 minutes or so, the whales decided it was time to be active and spread out a bit. It was hard to get ID's on all the whales, but we saw L79 (Skana), L72 (Racer), L105 (Fluke), L109 (new baby), and I think perhaps L88 (Wavewalker). One whale passed by and gave us a glorious spyhop before heading back to the rest of the group. The whales then decided to check out the Peapod Islands up close and personal.
