Orca Sightings for July 19, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
While at Anderson still with Deanna Lynch counting sea otters for the annual count (point off of Shi Shi Beach (N. WA coast, s. of Cape Flattery) we first heard and then spotted a
grey whale
who seems be hanging out close to shore foraging. Counted approximately 20 sea otters and many harbor seals from our observing spot as well.
