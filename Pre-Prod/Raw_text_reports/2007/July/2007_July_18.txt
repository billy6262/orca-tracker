Orca Sightings for July 18, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
While at Anderson with Deanna Lynch counting sea otters for the annual count (point off of Shi Shi Beach (N. WA coast, s. of Cape Flattery) we first heard and then spotted a
grey whale
who seems be hanging out close to shore foraging. Counted approximately 20 sea otters and many harbor seals from our observing spot as well.

Joe of Siggi-G's charters called in a report of a pod of 5
orcas
off
Cape Lookout, OR

A long one tonight, all the way from Sooke to Boundary Passage but well worth it to witness a non typical
J Pod
. Today J Pod did a very rare thing... It broke up in to two groups early this
morning
and Group A (Granny- Ruffles and a dozen more whales) quickly headed North from San Juan Island and went up to Georgia Strait. Group B ( The J-11s ?) stayed south and spent much of the day near False Bay and South Beach. This evening, Group B headed north ( perhaps looking for the rest of the Js ) and eventually made it to Turn Point. After some confusion as to where they were going next (Boundary Passage - Swanson Narrows or back south) and several false starts, the whales decide to go Swanson and headed up to the Pender Bluffs when I left them at
1945
tonight. As the sun began to set, the fog magically dissipated and we had a beautiful voyage back to Sooke Harbour.

We had a great, foggy, misty day on the water. In the morning, from

10:50 a.m. -
11:50
, in Haro Strait off Turn Point Lighthouse, we were with many
J-Pod
whales, including J-16 and family. The new baby, J-42 continues to zip along very energetically, sometimes seemingly in an "out front" location! J-26 was right in there. Also, J-17, J-28 and J-35 cruised by in their tight family group. J-1 was far to the west in Haro. All were moving north in traveling behavior, or slow traveling (resting). At

3:30
, on our second trip, we found J-Pod to be south, at Pile Point on San Juan Island! But wait! These were not the same family groups as this morning. It was VERY foggy, and adult fins appeared in and out of the fog, moving in some direction, but in the fog? Who knows! J-27 surfaced with a loud blow in the mist! All in all there were between 8 - 10 whales, foraging, and not moving or traveling to join the other part of J Pod, now reported north of Pender Island headed for Active Pass. The water was flat, the day rainy and cool, the air heavy with mist and fog, but the experience was incredible. As always, the time with the whales and out on the water, was mystical.

After being awoken by the sound of
killer whale
blows (off west San Juan Island) at about
6 a.m.
, staff observed
Jpod
passing the Center prior to heading out in R/V Orca. The J14's were encountered just outside Snug Harbor at
7:54 a.m., and were soon joined by J28, J17and J35. The whales were actively foraging, with a lot of lunging and diving. The highlight of the trip was J28 surfacing near the research boat with a salmon in her mouth. (see photo by Emma Foster, Center for Whale Research) Encounter ended at
9:16 a.m.

I saw a pod of approx 6
Orca
today, including 1 male, in the Tahsis Inlet/Tsowwin Narrows of
Nootka Sound
on West Coast of Vancouver Island at

4:30 pm
, traveling south. They appeared to be Feeding or Rubbing. Thanks
