about
noon
-
orcas
reported off Pt. Migley, Lummi Island - spread out in small groups, making their way south past Rosario Strait into Bellingham Channel - (

2:30 p.m.
) - around
3:00
J pod
grouped up in a resting pattern heading south in Bellingham Channel, then turned part way down and came back north (!) hugging the shoreline along Cypress Island. Last seen still heading north along the Orcas island west shoreline at
6:00 p.m. Good day out in a small skiff with seals, porpoise, guillemots, eagles, crab, AND orcas - hallelujah!

We were surprised to see one male
transient
heading SSE about 300m south of the Quathiaski Cove Ferry Terminal on Quadra Island (across from Campbell River) at about

1:25 pm
. It surfaced about 25m from shore, right in front of us! There was a strong current which he was following. We think that it was probably T14, but we only saw him for a few seconds and my camera was in the cabin so I did not get a photo.

Today was rather wonderful. The Springer Reunion was scheduled to go out on their whale watch, thanks to Stubbs Island, at
2pm
. just before the hour struck the
A12s
led the march up the Strait to just shy of Telegraph Cove. The A11s with
Springer
were in the rear. A short while later the whales turned and proceded back to the east. They are passing through the Ecological Reserve at the moment. The A8s were travelling with the A35s closer to the Cracroft Island side while the A12s were midstrait and the A11s closer to the Vancouver Island side and now in the lead.

We were part of the Springer Reunion at Telegraph Cove. Indeed we did see
Springer
(A73) during our whale watch with Stubbs. She is looking fantastic. Very healthy and robust. We had good views of her and the rest of the A11 pod.
