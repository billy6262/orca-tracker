============================================================

Entry 1:
J16 and J42
this
morning
during our Vancouver - Victoria trip on the Ocean Magic. J42 was displaying amazing stamina, racing ahead of mum, chasing her big brother Mike, this little one is definitely full of spunk and cute as a button.

Saw
J pod
and possibly some
L's
... 3 different times as they did the West Side Shuffle (up & down the west side of San Juan Island). At one point (couldn't ID anybody... sorry!) there was 2 females, 1 male and the new baby... the adults were pushing baby up on their heads out of the water... and kind of surfing with him! And then they would all roll in the water... baby in between everyone... rolling on his back and slapping pec fins... always touching with the 4 whales.

A pair of
humpbacks
came past Chito Point (seven miles west of Sekiu) at

3:30 pm
, steadily moving west. One of the pair was a fairly large whale. They were traveling in unison, spouting together, however only the large humpback was doing frequent tail waves.

From far off I saw a whale between Low Point and Crescent Beach on the Strait of Juan de Fuca heading east. I heard it once; heard it again and sighted it and saw the tip of its tail as it dove; heard it a third time and saw it come up for air and then dive back down again. It looked like a
grey
