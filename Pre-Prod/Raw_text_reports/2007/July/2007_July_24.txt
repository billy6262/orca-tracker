Orca Sightings for July 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We heard multiple reports of 3 groups of
humpbacks
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. One group was well west of Race Rocks, one group of two were inside Race Rocks, and one lone humpback was closer in out by Hein Bank. So we figured we'd take a look at the nearest humpback since this is somewhat rare to find humpbacks in these waters this early in the season. But somehow by the time we got out to the location, no one knew where the lone humpback had gone. So we headed west to look at the pair that by this time were closer towards Port Angeles. Most of the boats were leaving, but those who stayed were treated to a rare sight--what appeared to be a mother and young calf traveling together. But the best part was the mother began rolling around and showing those huge pectoral fins while her youngster did the same thing. The contrast in size is amazing! Then the mother began doing very high and splashy tail lobs!

We saw a
Minke
Whale right off of Eagle Cove, San Juan Island, at
0725
this morning. Really calm seas, in close, great views of the color pattern and dorsal fin. It was heading east towards Cattle Pass.
