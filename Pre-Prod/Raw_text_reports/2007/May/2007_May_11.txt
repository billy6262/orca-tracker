The Center for Whale Research had an encounter with

J pod
leaders showed up at Hannah Heights around
noon
today, with J42 among the leaders. She appears to be another superbaby. I timed one of her dives at
2:25 minutes. J16, her mom, was taking long dives, yet I saw J42 come up for a breath only one time without her mom surfacing before her. She appears to have lots of energy. Although I could watch only a short time, as I left I heard one of the boats report that J42 was chasing fish with her mom.

I wasn't too optimistic of seeing whales on the trip home to Snug Harbor. As I came around Kellet Bluff, there were no boats to be seen, so I was quite surprised to see a huge breach about 500 yards from my boat. I quickly shut down and waited to see whether it was part of
J-Pod
, or perhaps some of the transients rumored to be in the area. I sat quietly just outside a strong rip tide, trying to figure out where the whale would come back up. Soon a dorsal fin appeared in front of me, and it appeared to be J-22. A adolescent calf was traveling nearby, so I was doubly happy to see 2 whales. And then just on the in-shore side of the current, up came J16 and her little calf. She sure is a cutie! I just sat until they were north of the bluff, and slowly puttered into port.
