============================================================

Entry 1:
After watching
J pod
swim by the Center for Whale Research, w. San Juan Island, staff departed in the research vessel to track the whales from

2:43 p.m.-
4:19 p.m
. as they swam north in Haro Strait. The whales were swimming in their family groups and were traveling at a slow pace. Some social behavior was observed particularly between J37 and her younger sister, J40. Both whales were breaching over and over again near Battleship Island. Staff left J pod in Boundary Pass as they continued north toward Swanson Channel.
Observers: Katie Jones, Erin Heydenreich, Stefan Jacobs, Courtney Smith, and Basil von Ah (volunteer).

Jpod
was seen again in Boundary Pass by Saturna. They were first seen at Monarch Head around

6:30 pm
and were slowly heading west while feeding, slapping fins with lots of spyhopping and seemingly playful behaviour. They turned north (across the reef) at East Point around
7:15 p.m. closely followed by a giant sealion sweeping up behind them. J1 was at the end of the pod, this time accompanied by three other whales.

Met
Js
shorebound fast from the southern mouth of Haro Strait, mid-channel, late this morning. Spread out over a few miles; there appeared to be two groups, one to the south and the other to the north. The north group "touched down" in the vicinity of False Bay and appeared to veer up-island. The south group stopped off the shore of American Camp, and milled about slowly.

At exactly
12 noon
we sighted a California
Gray Whale
heading North in the Pickering Passage between Dougall Pt. on Harstene Island and McLane Cove on the mainland. Could not tell if it was male or female but appeared to be full grown. It seemed to be headed for the Case Inlet at normal traveling speed and was not feeding or playing.
