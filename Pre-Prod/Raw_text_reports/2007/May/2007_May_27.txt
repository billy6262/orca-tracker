============================================================

Entry 1:
I had the opportunity to see some (six or seven)
transients
, big T-87 among them, travel past my house in Deer Harbor this
afternoon
.
Tom Averna, Deer Harbor Charters, Orcas Island

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called to report a pod of 8
Transients
- in the
morning
he had them east of Obstruction, making a kill at Broken Head, south of the Lopez ferry, then up San Juan Channel, then left them at Turn Pt. at

7:15 pm
heading north.
*
The call came in that
J-Pod
was in Rosario, heading southward. We never made it to J-Pod as a nice grouping of
Transients
appeared out of nowhere and were heading into the same pass as us! T87 was ID'd. The transients headed towards the Lopez ferry dock and then turned up Harney channel as if they were doing a tour of ferry docks. Last we heard they were passing between the Orcas & Shaw island ferry terminals.
John Boyd (JB), Marine Naturalist, Western Prince

J pod
off Lummi Island just around
noon
- spread out and heading south - Ruffles and Granny bringing up the rear. No boats except for a couple of lucky kayaks and one small recreational fishing boat that blasted thru the whales (don't think they realized the whales were in the area...) Happy turistas watching from shore....!!
