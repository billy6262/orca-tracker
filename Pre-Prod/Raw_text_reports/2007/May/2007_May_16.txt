Orca Sightings for May 16, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
travelled westward up Swanson Channel and past Mouat Pt. at

4:30 pm
, J42 (still slightly pink stained) and her mom were second to last to go by and very close to shore below our cliff and surfaced repeatedly. The last time, the mother pushed the baby upwards as it was surfacing and it wriggled side to side then slapped its tail before diving again. Ruffles was in mid channel, mid way thru the group.

All members of
J-pod
were around us sailing fast in the ebbing tide. They did slow a bit to give us a couple of spy-hops and the baby flashed her orange sides to us. This was in the middle of Rosario Strait abeam of Thatcher Pass. Later, we heard they were over on the west side of San Juan.
