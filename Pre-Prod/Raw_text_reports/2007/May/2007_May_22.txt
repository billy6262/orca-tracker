Orca Sightings for May 22, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I thought I had heard [
gray
] whale spouts at night in Saratoga Passage, from Greenbank, but only heard them twice & was not totally sure it was grays, but this report of new feeding pits on Camano fit into the timeframe & location of the blows I heard.
