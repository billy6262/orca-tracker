circling his boat 4 times.

This morning at

4:30 AM
a
gray whale
was feeding very close to the shore, west of Langley. The whale worked it's way back and forth for an hour and then at
5:30 headed to the west still feeding. At

8:40 AM
a gray whale (I think it was the same one) swam by, just past the drop off, heading to the east in front of Langley.

At about

12:30 am
I heard what sounded like a
gray whale
spouting off North Bluff, north of Greenbank in Saratoga Passage. I only heard it about 3 times, & couldn't determine the direction of travel, but it was wonderful to hear!
