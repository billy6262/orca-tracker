Entry 1:

2:00 pm
. They seemed to be feeding, got to see one spy hop, they were very active. We observed them for about half an hour as they fed in that surrounding area.

Jpod's newest member
. J42 joins pod, traveling alongside mother J16. Following several reports of a possible new calf in Jpod, Dave Ellifrit, Katie Jones and Courtney Smith of the Center for Whale Research encountered Jpod off the west side of San Juan Island traveling slowly northbound. Upon closer inspection, Dave Ellifrit confirmed that J16 (born ~1972) did in fact have a new calf beside her. The new calf is officially designated J42, though the sex of the young whale is yet to be determined. The calf is the fourth calf born to J16. Her other offspring include: J16 (male, 1991); J33 (male, 1996); and J36 (unk., 1999). J-pod was last encountered by the Center for Whale Research
April 28, 2007. J16 did not have the calf with her at that time, which leads Center staff to believe the newborn calf is less than 4 days-old at the time of this encounter.
