Orca Sightings for May 5, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband was shrimping just south of Columbia Beach (Whidbey Island), and believes he saw five different
grays
between the island and the mainland. Shrimping was great that day. He shrimped again on Wednesday,
May 9, didn't see any whales - and the shrimping wasn't nearly as good.
