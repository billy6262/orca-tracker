Orca Sightings for May 13, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We live on North Pender Island, B.C., facing south onto Swanson Channel about 1.5 km south of Mouat Pt. We saw
J pod
, including the new calf, travelling westward between Pender and Moresby Is. (stopping to fish & circle at times, with a few breaches) at
9 am
.

I saw a tight group of 3 female
orcas
(one smaller than the other two) heading North from the ferry as we approached the Kingston Dock. The captain made an announcement. The Puyallap was just leaving Kingston and headed due North for a long way to avoid them.
