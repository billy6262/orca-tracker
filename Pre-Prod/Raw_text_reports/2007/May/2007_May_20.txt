Orca Sightings for May 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
On our evening trip we spent about 20 minutes with
J16
and her new calf, the very active
J42
. Both are looking good. I was able to get these pictures. Hope you enjoy them (see photo of adorable calf! Another is on our "Baby Page"). We left J Pod heading south east at

6:30 PM
spread between Hannah Hts. and four miles off shore, West Side, San Juan Is.

Just before I was about to pull into the
9 PM
Tsawassen ferry I saw the familiar spout patterns of my favorite animals [
orcas
]! I quickly parked and ran to the top deck and outside. I watched at least 3 orcas play around the ferry path, moving on after about 15 minutes. There seemed to be a mom and smallish orca right together, and then a bigger one about 50-100 Meters away (bodyguarding?).
