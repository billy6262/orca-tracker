Orca Sightings for May 1, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately

5:00PM
we saw what I think was a single
minke
whale. We are on South Pender Island and the whale was traveling toward Saturna Island.
Rob Southey/Diane McBain, S. Pender Island

We sighted Ruffles north of the light with a three year old or so. They seemed to be fishing together, then the little one began breaching. I quit counting after 8 breaches!
J-pod
was spread out for several miles in small groups. Mike and Blackberry swam by, although we were on the look-out for Slick and her suspected new baby. The Ocean Magic had her offshore of the others, but we never got over to find her. There was breaching, tail- slapping and seeming celebration everywhere!

We received a call with a report of a pod of 4
orcas
+ a young calf from
6-
8:30 am
, off the Port Orford, OR Dock, feeding off the breakwater at Nelly's Cove. They headed west at
8:30 am.
*
Saw one
gray
today north of Langley, feeding several hundred yards from shore. It then headed out to deeper water, possibly over to Camano.

7:00am
I was on my jog this morning and saw what appeared to be a [
gray
] whale not too far from Langley. I then went down to the Marina to the end of dock and there were two whales about 200 yards away. They both breached and their tales flipped up.

At

6:45 AM
two
gray whales
came by from west to east feeding on the beach in front of Langley. They stayed for Â½ hour before moving off to deeper water but continuing to head in a southeast direction.
