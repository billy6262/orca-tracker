Photographs taken
May 6, 2007, off Freshwater Bay (west of Port Angeles, WA) lead staff at the Center for Whale Research to believe that
J42
is a female. Based on the distinctive markings on the underside of the belly of this young calf, Center staff have concluded that the animal in these photos is a female. According to the photographer Derek Sterling, these photos were taken at

5:22
p.m., approximately 2 miles north (offshore) of Freshwater Bay. "The baby was very frisky," says Sterling, "at one point mom (J16) was throwing it up in the air off it's nose."

Early reports on the day had
J's
at Eagle Point heading for Lime Kiln. As we approached Cattle Point, we heard on the radio that the whales had turned and were heading back down island. So we finally found them heading towards Discovery Island. They were very spread out, but as has been seen a lot this season, J-26 Mike and J-27 Blackberry were traveling in close proximity. The contrast in dorsal fin size is amazing when they come up together. Also nearby were J-22 Oreo and her two youngsters, Doublestuff and Cookie. J-16 Slick was traveling a bit back from her son J26 with her other two kids, J33 and the new calf J42. While we floated with engines off, these groupings became very active with lots of tail slaps, and multiple spyhops.

I was just reading today's report when I heard a
Gray
down below at
10 pm
. The blow was so loud that it was obviously in one of the shrimp beds a few hundred feet west of East Point. I could hear the thrashing around in the water and all but see fins stirring the bottom for late night snacks.

We saw two [
gray
] whales in Port Susan Bay on Sunday afternoon, around

5:00 PM
. We think they were grays but we could not say for sure. They were heading south slowly, quite active.

My husband and I were on the beach at Camano Island State park and saw a
gray whale
heading north at around

3:30
. It was just below the water and surfacing every minute or so. At about
4:00 a motor boat came through. The boat cut his engine as soon as he saw the whale, but he was less than 50 ft from it at the time. The whale dove deep, flukes in the air. We waited another half hour, but didn't see it any more.

Brookings OR
