I am very excited to report a pod of
Orcas
that we saw Friday off of Maury Island. I am very new to the sightings and never imagined seeing these regal beauties so can not tell what pod but it looked like to me a large number playing and feeding. My family and I were at the pier at Browns point crabbing around

2:00
when we spotted the pod.
