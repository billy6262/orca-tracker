Orca Sightings for December 31, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

2:30pm
between Gooch Island and Domville Island, we saw 5
orcas
as well as approximately 5-8 about Â½ mile ahead. These whales continued north and traveled along the west side of Moresby Island. There was one male, three females and a baby. I believe these are the Transients T87, T88 and T90. This is a best guess based on enlarging our pictures which were very grainy. However, the male, T87 has a very unique dorsal fin. I wasn't able to see the saddle on the Mom with her baby.

We started the day with
K40
surfing in the wake of a Foss Tug. It was pretty impressive. At

3:10 pm
they were between the S. end of Bainbridge Island & spread out across Elliott Bay. We were also able to get a few scale samples and left the whales (K pod) northbound off of Shilshole.

Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC reported they caught up with
K pod
around Three Tree Pt, & followed them as they made their way up north. K26 did quite a bit of foraging & they were able to get some samples, they turned back to watch K40 do the surfing thing for 15 minutes, and left the whales off Jefferson Head at

4:40 pm
.

Kari Koski from SoundWatch called to report watching
K pod
from the shores of Alki Pt! The whales were 1/4 - 1/2 mile offshore, spread out, passing by Alki at

2:35 pm
, heading north. They were doing some breaching & there were a lot of people walking the beach & watching from the shoreline. What more could anyone want for New Year's Eve?!

Dec. 31 DJ Mar watched K pod from the Whaler's Village Condos in Des Moines as they passed by Pt. Robinson heading north, a little after noon. They were breaching & spy hopping - it was her first time seeing the whales in her neighborhood - another great New Year's Treat!!

Darcie Larson called at

2:50 pm
to report seeing a large baleen whale north of Kingston - they saw several blows & a fluke as it appeared to possibly be feeding close to shore, with gulls swooping nearby. It was 1/2 mile north of Apple Cove Pt. At
3:10 pm she reported it appeared to be heading south, & she thought it likely was a
gray whale
