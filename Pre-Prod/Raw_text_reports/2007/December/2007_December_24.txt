Orca Sightings for December 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I wanted to let you know I saw some
orca's
. I was traveling on the
10:50am Kingston ferry heading to Edmonds. It was approx
11am
that I saw 2 orca's 3-4 different times. The last time I saw them they were about 15ft away from the boat on the North side traveling South to Bainbridge.

My husband & I spotted a decent-sized group of
orcas
in between Point-no-Point and Kingston, heading south towards Kingston. We are just north of Edmonds, and watched everything through our 2 pairs of binoculars. There was one whale with a very tall fin, and there appeared to be smaller whale(s), too. We are quite a distance away, so we couldn't make any positive IDs or get a decent count. This all happened between

9:25-
9:40am
