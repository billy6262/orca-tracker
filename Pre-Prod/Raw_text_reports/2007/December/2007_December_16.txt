Orca Sightings for December 16, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sylvia & Tom Stinson called to report a pod of
orcas
just south of Bush Pt, west Whidbey Island, heading NW at
4 pm
. There was one male with a large dorsal fin, & a submarine with escorts close behind the whales.
*
Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC said they were with
K pod & some of L's (L2's
) over the last 5 days in Puget Sound. They were able to get out every day but Saturday, & have been collecting fecal samples and fish scales to study what the orcas are eating. Apparently there's plenty of fish off Vashon Island because they've been hanging out there a lot! They left the whales Sunday afternoon at about

3:15 pm
off Point No Point, No. Kitsap Peninsula, heading NW.
*
The Orca Network hotline received a call at

8:20 am
reporting 6 - 12
orcas
heading slowly north in Colvos Passage, within 150 - 500' of the Kitsap shore (they were watching from the Wilson Creek Rd area).
