Orca Sightings for December 25, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Windwalker Taibi called at
2 pm
to relay a report from Beth Day of
orcas
off the Langley waterfront heading north. He called back to report they had reached his home on East Pt. & they watched them from
3 -
3:30 pm
. They saw at least 6 orcas, closer to the Camano side, then they headed across Saratoga Passage straight toward the Greenbank area. Then the snow squalls came & they couldn't see them anymore.

Nancy Nolan called at

3:45 pm
to report seeing approx. 5
orcas
, spread out just south of Baby Island (near the entrance to Holmes Harbor, Saratoga Psg). They were heading NW toward Baby Island & Greenbank.
*
We heard 3 - 4 [
orca
] blows in Saratoga Passage off North Bluff, N. of Greenbank, at

9:45 pm
. The full moon was blanketed by clouds so we couldn't see anything, & the wind was pretty noisy so we didn't get in a long listen, but it sounded like they were heading south down Saratoga Passage from what we could discern.
