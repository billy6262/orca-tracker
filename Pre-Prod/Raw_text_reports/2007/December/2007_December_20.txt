Orca Sightings for December 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to relay reports of
K pod
off N. Vashon Thursday
afternoon
.

The Captain of the Wenatchee announced there were [
orcas
] off the starboard side! I saw five whales at about
1 pm
. Looked to me to be an older female, at least one young male and some other young whales. One younger whale stayed about 50 yards behind a barge being towed. It swam close like that for a long time. Two others swirled, tail slapped. I first saw the orcas about 1/4 of the way across from the Winslow side. But, there were also whales (based on the Captain announcement) about 2/3 way across towards Seattle and just at the outer edge of Elliot Bay. While I was watching these four or five whales, the report from the Captain came on that there were whales nearer Seattle, so there had to be at least six or more total.

My husband is a ferry worker on the Kingston Ferry and at

8:50am
this morning he spotted several
orcas
passing the ferry.
