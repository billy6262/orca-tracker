Orca Sightings for December 11, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Eric Bloom of Calif. Dept. of Fish & Game, reporting a pod of
orcas
sighted off Ft. Bragg, out of Noyo Harbor, CA. There was 1 male & 3 females, just offshore in 25' of water. They put their boat in neutral when they saw the whales, & the whales swam right under the boat! The male had a very large, 5' tall fin.
