Orca Sightings for December 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw at least 6
Orcas
while heading to Seattle from Bremerton on the ferry. The pod was feeding directly in front of the ferry's path, so we had to stop. The pod then headed toward Vashon Island. There was at least one juvenile in the pod. Only saw one come above the water enough to see the white...mostly saw the fins. The fins did not appear to have any scars or markings on them and were very upright. No breaching or any such activity. Beauty in motion -

Amy Carey called at

12:30 pm
to report the pod of
orcas
was at Dilworth, NE Vashon Island, continuing south, very spread out (later confirmed as K pod). At
2 pm
she reported they had made a good pass close by Pt. Robinson, heading south, with a huge crowd of people onshore watching.
Then she sent this update: Well we finally left the whales at around

3:00
as they moved through the last bit of the Maury Reserve. They did the typical Point Robinson, Gold Beach, Glacier Northwest pass but sadly we had to leave them then. I wanted to share a bit of the note I got yesterday from an islander who would not have had the experience she did without the work of Orcanetwork: "Just a note to say THANK YOU! The orcas today were incredible. What a remarkable, beautiful, fulfilling, magnificent, majestic, life- affirming sight." There was a nice big crowd again today and lots of first timers and their kids. We had a nice close pass at the Point complete with a few in succession breaches and even a good spyhop. Lots of hooting an hollering from the shore- orcas really are the rock stars of Vashon island.

Fred Felleman reported the
orcas
were off Pt. Robinson at

1:55 pm
, heading south. There were LOTS of people on the beach - the whales were breaching & the people were cheering. THIS is what it's all about! sb

We saw a large grouping of
Orcas
off of Maury Island, between Tramp Harbor and Pt. Robinson (~

1:45 pm
). They came right in front of our place, and slowly surfaced over a period of 15-20 minutes and moved on their way south to Pt. Robinson. The group was pretty large and spread out between 100 feet off shore and all the way out in the middle of the channel.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC reported they caught up with the [
orcas
] in the early afternoon at Pt. Robinson, & left them continuing south at the entrance to Quartermaster Harbor. They confirmed it is again/still K pod - the researchers were able to collect several fish scale samples today.

We saw a pod of about 10
Orcas
between our home on Rolling Bay Bainbridge Island and Shilshole. They we travelling south closer to the Seattle side at

9:00am
. One group of 4, one of 3 (both with younger ones) and scattered individuals including one big male.

approaching the north end of Vashon Island, heading south, closer to the Vashon side. They weren't close enough yet to get any ID's.
