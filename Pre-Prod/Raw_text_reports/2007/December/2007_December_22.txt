Orca Sightings for December 22, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Veronica von Allworden watched the pod of
orcas
as they passed through Saratoga Passage from Langley, Whidbey Island. At

1:45 pm
they were across from Langley, closer to the Camano side, heading south. She saw two breaches - they were really spread out & were not yet to Camano Head.

Soon as we received the report of
orcas
in Saratoga Passage, we headed out in the car to south Whidbey to find them. We caught up with them off Langley at

2:25 pm
, very spread out, still heading south. At
2:50 pm they were just north of Camano Head, with the leaders reaching Sandy Pt. First they were closer to Camano, but then came closer to Whidbey as they passed Sandy Pt. & traveled between Hat (Gedney) Island & Whidbey as they headed south into Possession Sound. From 3 -
3:25 pm, the trailers were off Camano Head with the leaders heading past Hat Island. From

3:30 - 4 pm we watched from Brighton Beach, just north of the Clinton Ferry - they were spread out all across Possession Sound from Whidbey to Mukilteo, there were several breaches in the distance. We watched them just south of the Clinton ferry from

4:10 -
4:45 pm, continuing south. At
5 pm
they were off Possession Park - it was getting dark, but most seemed to be passing fairly close in & we could hear their blows. We've tentatively ID'd them as K pod, & are waiting for confirmation from the Center for Whale Research.
