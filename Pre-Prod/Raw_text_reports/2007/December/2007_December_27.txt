Orca Sightings for December 27, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi I am on your network. I work on the Island Packer Boats out of Ventura,
CA
. I am out of town right now, but I think on the previous day on the 27th all three boats had seen 20 adults (
orcas
) and at least 10 calves off the northwest end of Anacapa Island, I believe there was some video, I usually shoot the stillshots but of course was out of town.
Thanks Anthony Lombardi

I had a early trip out of Victoria today. We came across a single male
transient
killerwhale near Becher Bay (Sooke) inbound. I also heard a distant call on the hydrophone , so other animals could have been in the area. Unfortunately I did not have my camera
*
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported hearing one piercing
call
from the Center's hydrophones mid- morning Thursday, but then nothing more. Perhaps the same T's as in the report above?

We received a call from Amy Carey, who had received a report of a pod of
orcas
heading south past Pt. Robinson, E. Maury Island just before
10 am
this morning.
