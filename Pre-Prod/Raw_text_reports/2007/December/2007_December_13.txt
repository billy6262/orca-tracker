Orca Sightings for December 13, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a Pod of
Orca
at

10:30 AM
. I was heading south from Des Moines Marina in my sailboat. I was approximately one mile south of Pt. Robinson on Maury Island when I spotted the Pod swimming North. I was motoring South on the Western edge of the south bound shipping lane about one half+ miles off the beach. They were a couple hundred yards closer to the beach. I counted at least seven and might have been nine or more. Most were slapping tails and splashing fins and a few would stand upright with their head sticking up from the water. Two of the larger ones stayed further to the west and did not appear to be splashing, just surfacing once or twice a minute and moving North. Hope this info is useful.

I got a phone call from Jeff at about

10:30
- someone had called him with a second hand report of
Orcas
SE Maury/Commencement bay and then shortly thereafter I got a call from a Maury island orcawatcher with a report of the Orcas just passing his house -which is just South and around the bend from Pt. Robinson, as always smack dab in the reserve area. He said they were heading North. Jeff relayed the info to Brad and he did catch up to them so we should have some info on the who's. I was able to watch them from the mainland -I don't think I would have found them if Brad had not been with them, it was pretty nasty and they were far away. They were off of Blake island by about

1:30 -closer to the West side of the passage. They continued Northward towards Bainbridge but sadly both Jeff and I lost them in the chop at about

3:00
.
