Orca Sightings for December 30, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went on the Island Packers boat out of Ventura, California, to see gray whales, but between Ventura & Anacapa Island, we came across a pod of about 6
orcas
feasting on a sea lion. We observed them for about an hour swimming around in the same area, spending time underwater and then comng back up right near our boat. We saw one orca head butt the sea lion through the air. There was a young orca with the group that showed the pinkish cast to it's white areas. The adults displayed some tail lobbing.
