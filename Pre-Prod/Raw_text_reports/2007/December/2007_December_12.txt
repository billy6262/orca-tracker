Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Virginia of Seiku, 8 miles east of Neah Bay, WA, reporting a
humpback
whale, and
gray
whales showing up there
daily
.
*
Mark Sears and Mike Ford and I did make it out - found [
orcas
] off West Point with Jeff Hogan's help - Jeff had seen K7 and we saw several other K whales but they were really spread out north bound - left them at Edmonds ferry lanes at
1550
. did get several scales samples and a fecal sample.

Just got a report at

10:50 am
of
Orcas
Just North of Vashon. Sounds like they are heading North to West. Update at

12:30
: Just came in from some squinty eyed binocular viewing. Whales were still more or less North bound but not going too fast. Jeff Hogan got a much better view of them from the other side and will have some photos for ID's too.

Jeff Hogan called at
11 am
to say he saw the
orcas
off Vashon Island, then later called with the news he had photographed & ID'd K7, & possibly saw some L pod whales but was waiting for confirmation from the Center for Whale Research.

orcas
in the Puget Sound area. At

9:47 am

At
