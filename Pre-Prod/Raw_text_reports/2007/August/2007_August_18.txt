Orca Sightings for August 18, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I got a reliable report from a sport fisher I was interviewing in Neah Bay on Sunday about a group of 15+
orcas
6 miles west of Cape Flattery at

16:00
(no direction). They were milling around out there while the fishers were catching Chinooks. They had 3-4 bulls among them.
