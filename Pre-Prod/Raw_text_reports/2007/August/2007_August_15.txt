Orca Sightings for August 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
11am
we took the kids to Crescent Bay and were delighted to see 3-4
gray whales
very close to shore with a baby in the group. They looked like they were feeding, rolling around a bit. The whales were there the whole time we were there...about 2 hours and began heading west as we were leaving. I have seen them in Crescent Bay every summer since I have moved to Freshwater Bay in the summer of 2003. With the baby otters (reported by a friend), baby seal and whales, it was quite a morning.

We traveled far from Friday Harbor, arriving 8 miles off Vancouver, B.C. about

3:20 p.m
. We enjoyed watching 7
transient orcas
travel up Georgia Strait, in very calm water, on a warm, sunny afternoon. The whales stopped and demonstrated foraging behavior, quick turns, splitting into groups of three and four, and treated us to spy hops, breaches, a double breach with two whales seeming to synchronizing their breaches one right after another in front of each other. Amazing. Then one of the juveniles did a series of "chin hops"....poking it's white chin up, up, up on the surface. The group was very active, but no prey was visible. There was one adult male sporting a magnificent dorsal fin, with a definite tip to the right side. There were several adult females, and at least two juveniles. (possibly T-101's and T-124's?).

We finally located
Transient orcas
on our way home. At approx

12:45
, a group of between 10-12 T's were northbound in the Southbound shipping lanes, approx 2 miles south of Active Pass. The group was later identified as some of the T100 group, including T100 with a calf and a juvenile, and mature male T102. The group were sometimes travelling quite a distance apart, then would group up for several surfacings, and once again go their seperate ways. Their travel rate varied from approx 2 knots, up to about 6 knots. When we left the whales, they were off Active Pass, still in the vicinity of the shipping lanes. On our afternoon trip, we rejoined this same group of whales about 3 miles north of Active Pass, and several miles offshore of Galiano Island. Several animals had left scene, leaving us with just 7 whales. The group was now in a playful mood. We were treated to a backward breach with sea snake by T102, lots of milling about, several breaches (even a double breach), tail slaps, spyhops, logging, some echolocation and some faint vocals that sounded like "babies". There appeared to be lots of interaction between T100 and her offspring, while T102 headed off in the distance with what appeared to be a female and a young male. After about 30 minutes of this uncharacteristic Transient behaviour, the whales grouped up again and resumed their more typical 3-4 breaths, followed by a long dive. We left the whales Northbound along Galiano Island and returned to dock with very satisfied passengers!
