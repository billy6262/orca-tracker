Transients
Killer whales (T101's) enter Strait of Juan de Fuca. Following reports of several Transient Killer whales heading East from Race Rocks earlier in the day, staff Dave Ellifrit and Courtney Smith from the Center for Whale Research decided to investigate and attempt to confirm the identity of the whales. Center staff arrived on scene at

5:51 p.m
to find the T101's (
T101, T101A, T101C and T102
) close together, traveling very quickly due south. The whales generally made long dives, sometimes lasting more than a minute in duration. Toward the end of the encounter T101A split off from the other whales and then traveled parallel with them as they continued moving south toward Puget Sound. The encounter ended at

6:43 p.m

This
afternoon
we had the good fortune to see the
T100's
off Discovery Island. They were not making much headway against the strong flood tide, and spent several hours moving only half a mile.
