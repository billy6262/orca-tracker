We spotted this [

Many people have remarked about a "small" minke whale. this may be a young of the year or a one year old. it is not possible for us to say at this point. we have seen this whale on several occasions this summer, swimming with Johnney Rotten. This small whale, whom we have named "Prince", is what we call a "dinky minke". You may have noticed the breath of minke whales. We have discovered the smell to be like over-cooked broccoli. We call one of these whales a "stinky minke". The random walks we are studying in minkes often make them difficult to follow and predict their movements. We call these "slinky minkes". We had one whale who appeared to be a full sized adult some times, but when swimming in a low surfacing fashion, appeared to be much smaller. This whale is termed a "shrinky minke". A minke whale who gets something caught in its eye is, of course, a "blinky minke". i could go on, but most of you have probably scrolled over to a killer whale posting by now...so keep those reports coming in, we really appreciate them! jon, frankie and rus Jonathan Stern, Ph.D, NE Pacific Minke Whale Projec

We crossed the Strait of Juan de Fuca where a lone
gray
whale was feeding fairly close to the shoreline.

This morning (

8:30a.m.
) while we were fishing Midchannel Bank out of Pt. Townsend in the fog, we had a
gray whale
surface a couple of times within 25 yards of our boat. We were both heading towards Marrowstone Island.

My wife spotted a "blow" at about

7:00 PM
off Lagoon Point on the West side of Whidbey Island (app 48ยบ05', 122ยบ40'). She called it to may attention and we watched as it surfaced 5 more times as it traveled South toward Bush Point. It was large and dark, probably a Gray, but I thought it had a small fin on its back. I don't know if Humpbacks ever come into Puget Sound.

hmmm - there was a gray in the area that day (see above report) but if it had a small fin, it could have been either a minke whale or possibly a humpback - sb

on the Lime Kiln hydrophone!! I'm tuned in as always and at
10.12pm
I heard something that I couldn't identify (by using the audio samples of The Center For Whale Research. This time it lasted only till 10.15pm and I didn't hear them on OrcaSound after. Just cruising by I guess.
