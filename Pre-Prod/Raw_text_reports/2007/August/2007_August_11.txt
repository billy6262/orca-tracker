Entry 1:
L&K Pod
West bound at
7PM
off of Sherringham Point. That with the Sea Lions and Elephant Seals at Race Rocks made for many different marine mammal types. Wow!

Jim Maya relayed reports of the Southern Residents heading in, E. of Port Renfrew. John Boyd had also heard reports of So. Residents off W. Vancouver Island.

Jim Maya called at about

12:15
, to report a very interesting encounter with the lone
Pacific White Sided Dolphin
that's been hanging around San Juan Island. They saw it off Hannah Heights, first "playing" with a Harbor porpoise calf, thought it didn't look like the calf was enjoying the game. Then, an adult Harbor Porpoise came on the scene, & the adult Harbor Porp & the Pacific White Sided Dolphin began frolicking together (it looked like they were playing, though maybe the adult Harbor Porpoise was trying to protect the calf?). He saw the Harbor Porpoise breach completely out of the water (Harbor porpoise are not typically acrobatic like this!). Very interesting observations! Jim then headed over to the Victoria Waterfront, where they also saw 6
Transient Orcas
and three
Humpbacks
...

This
PM

Humpbacks
at Constance Bank (&
So. residents
-see above report).

We continue to have
gray whales
here at green point on the strait (of Juan de Fuca, between Pt. Angeles & Sequim). we can count about 3 whales at a time so we are thinking there may be as many as 20-25 whales here.
