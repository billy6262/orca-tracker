Orca Sightings for August 7, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received another call on our hotline, from Thayer Hillis, a commercial fisherman who reported 3 - 4
orcas
, 1-2 adult males, at
6 pm
. They were 90 - 100 miles west of
Newport OR
, at 44 58 40.1N 125 21 08.6W.

Our morning trip had us out near Discovery Island with what were rumored to be most of
L-Pod
. But by the time we got out there, most of the L's had turned west again, while the
L-12's
came roaring in. The water was flat calm and it was impressive to see L86 and L79 porpoising in. While a huge cargo ship passed by, several whales spyhopped to watch it make the turn up Haro Strait. But the morning got better as we found a
Pacific White-sided Dolphin
hanging around Eagle Point. He (well, we'll assume it was a he for now) was racing from one boat to another, showing off the characteristic acrobatic nature. In 11 years, this is my first encounter with one of these beautiful animals, and we can only wonder why a lone dolphin has been hanging around the west side of San Juan. Later on our afternoon trip, the L12's were still content to forage along the Cattle Point area, making frequent direction changes. We also saw a very young
minke whale
about 2 miles from the orcas, and the minke was getting his fill by lunging through bait balls he came across. It was amazing to be able to compare/contrast a baleen whale and a toothed whale in the same trip!

Lpod
members; Skana / L79, Solstice / L89, Onyx / L87, Spirit / L22, and Mystery / L85 were all together in a restful but social behavior near Eagle Point, San Juan Island this afternoon. Some spy hops, and rubbing of bodies it seemed. At one point the animals seemed to group up and hang out, even on top of each other.

Out at Crescent Bay surfing this afternoon, two
gray whales
in the bay. Looked like possibly a Mom and baby. They were happily and leisurely cruising about all afternoon and into sunset. Looked like they were feeding (? - but I am no expert). They were consistently withing 100 yards of the beach, the bay was quiet and virtually empty.
