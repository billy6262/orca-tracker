Orca Sightings for August 25, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a
gray whale
early on Sat
am
out at Crescent beach very close to shore.

Pat Ness of Chito Beach Resort, 7 miles west of Seiku, called to report 3
gray
whales off the Seiku breakwater at Olsen's. She also reported 2
Humpback
whales from
August 24 - 26, going back and forth between Seiku & the west (entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca) for the last 3 days.
*
At Crescent Bay north of Port Angeles. A whale, most thought a
gray
, though none of us has any expertise, spent virtually the entire last two days back and forth 150 yards off-shore. Appeared to us approximately 20 - 30 feet long, no dorsal, all by itself. Others at the camping area said there had been at least one other on Thursday.

With part of
L-Pod
coming down the west side (San Juan Isl) almost at Lime Kiln, the Island Commuter II stumbled upon a group of whales at Pile Point. It seemed to make sense that these could be part of L-Pod, just further down island. One of the whales looked a lot like L57. But as we got a closer look, they were not acting like residents, and there was a sprouter male that looked unlike any whale we have ever seen. After much discussion with some of the other captains, we are about 95% sure we had the
T30s and T19s
, with T19B being the sprouter. Very interesting to have them hanging out just a few miles down from the Residents.

We have a very dispersed group of
orcas
off South Lopez this morning. Originally moving to the west they are currently (

10:40am
) milling about a mile east of Iceberg Point.
