Orca Sightings for August 17, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were out at Trial Island as we watched the
T124's and T90's
making their way up Haro Strait. Towards the
end of the day
, as we were preparing to leave, the whales quickly turned direction and began out of the water porpoising in one direction. In 11 years as a volunteer on Soundwatch, this is the first time I've witnessed this type of super-active porpoising where the entire orcas body clears the water several feet. At one point we had several whales out of the water chasing this single Dall's porpoise! The Dall's porpoise, being one of the fastest cetaceans in the ocean, did manage to escape and the transients eventually gave up and returned to their original path.

A small group of 4 to 6
orcas
spread out a bit and travelling northeast through Moresby Channel across the north end of North Pender Island towards Active Pass. They were swimming slowly - with some diving but not too long. With reports of several groups of Transients in the area, and similar T group earlier in the day, suspect these are also T's. No apparent male observed from our 3 nm scoped vantage point.

Just spotted what appear to be
Transients
at

10:55 am
(based on other reports of T's being in the area) going north up Shute Passage just west of Portland Island. We are observing them via scope at long distance from North Pender Island. The initial clue was 3 whale watching escorts racing to the scene. There appear to be about 4 to 6 orca, moving slowly with some diving - hard to see at all times due to the distance (5 nm) from us. Update at
11:45 am - the T's reported earlier (the Prince of Whales boat out of Victoria will know best if they were T's). They are heading east, just south and east of Fulford Harbour (Eleanor Pt.) at Saltspring. Long dives, up for a few blows and then down again. 5 to 7 orca.
