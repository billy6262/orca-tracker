============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

6:30pm
, lots of
orcas
(maybe two dozen) travelling east-to-west off Flint Beach (South Lopez). They were very spread out, but fairly active with breaches, tail slaps and spy hops.

11:30 PM
and we have [
orcas
] in Open Bay! How do I know?? They sound awfully good on the OrcaSound hydrophone.... That and I can hear the huge slams of what I can only imagine are breaches on the water.... Listening a bit more....sounds like K-Pod! :)

I just tuned in at
10.50pm
and I have never heard something like this before!! I definately hear
J pod
, but there are so many calls.. long - short, clicks, chirps and squeeks going on.. I don't know how to describe it, but it's amazing!! Sounds like there's a party going on out there.. :o) wish I was invited.. Now, 10 mintutes later the sounds are fading slowly.. It's 11.15pm and the orcas have now joined the male harbor seal at OrcaSound. Still vocalizing incredibly!!

I tuned into OrcaSound at

9:25 pm
while working on the next whale report, & was happy to at least HEAR the whales we'd missed earlier today (see reports below)! They were vocalizing like crazy off Lime Kiln.

At

4:45 pm
we received a call from John Boyd, who told us
all three pods
were due west of NAS Whidbey Island, still heading south & looking they could be heading down Whidbey.

Orca Network received a call from Jill Hein, Sandy Dubpernell & Marty Crowley of Whidbey Island, who were all onboard Jim Maya's boat this afternoon, & were with a superpod of
J, K & L 's
off Deception Pass at
3 pm
, heading S. along the shore of NW Whidbey. By
3:50, they were about 5 miles N. of Rocky Pt, the whales still heading south.

About

1:45pm
today we watched two groups headed west-to- east between Iceberg Point and Aleck Bay on South Lopez.. The first group was a dense pack of about a dozen whales with no obvious adult males and one very cute baby. They were followed at a respectable distance by four more whales, including what looked like two adult males. All of them were in travelling mode

Center for Whale Research staff were alerted to the presence of
Southern Resident Killer whales
when vocalizations were heard coming from one of the hydrophones located along the west side of San Juan Island. Staff of the Center took the R/V Orca out to investigate. Members of J- pod, and subsequently K-pod were located at

10:47 am
, spread out in Haro Strait traveling northbound. As the staff of the Center continued south towards False Bay and Eagle Point, members of the
L-pod
were encountered, and numerous "jumpers" (small salmon jumping at the surface) were observed. During the encounter staff observed
J31, K35 and L87
chasing a salmon, and ultimately J31 was seen with the salmon held tightly in her mouth. Salmon scales were collected and will be provided to John Ford (DFO) and Brad Hanson (NWFSC). The new calf L110 and it's mother L83 were also located among the pod, and detailed photographs of both the left and right side of the new calf were obtained. Though the L-pod remained in the vicinity of the west side of San Juan Island into the afternoon, the J-pod and K-pod traveled north through Boundary Pass, past East Point, ultimately heading to the Fraser River. The encounter ended at

3:55 p.m
.

, reporting 4 - 5

off Pt. Edwards, near Edmonds, WA, heading north. They were about 1/2 mile off-shore.
