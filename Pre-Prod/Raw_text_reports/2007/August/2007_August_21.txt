This
afternoon
we are sitting there watching a
Humpback
west of Victoria, and all of a sudden we see four
Transient
, mammal eating
Orcas
headed toward the Humpback. The Orcas swim right by the Humpback. Then they swim right by a Harbor Seal. We left them right at Race Rocks, still headed west. I don't remember hearing of Orcas attacking a large whale, like a Humpback or a Gray, in this area. There are sooooo many seals. They have chased and eaten Minkes in this area.
