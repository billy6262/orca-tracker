Orca Sightings for August 27, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Caller Frank ?, reported 3 small
orcas
(no adult males) moving south very slow, at N 38 4 W 123 5 (a few miles NW of
Pt. Reyes, CA
.
*
This evening around
8 PM
there were 4-5
transients
off of the Land Bank Preserve on the west side of San Juan Island. It was a very active group - lots of breaching, tail slapping, dorsal fin slaps, and rolling around on the surface. There were no adult males present. When I got there, they were about 200 yards off shore, but headed offshore to the northwest and disappeared into the spectacular orange sunset.

We had a mixed group of
transients
(T41's included) who decided to peruse the entrance to Victoria Harbor! It was quite intriguing to have mammal-hunting orcas foraging with the cityscape of Victoria as a backdrop. I was looking through the lens of my camera and saw 3 transients swimming left to right when suddenly one popped up pointing the opposite direction, but swimming in the same direction as the rest of the group. The whales entered the harbor a ways, then dove on a long dive only to come up near the concrete breakwater at the eastern side of the entrance. They took their time perusing several haul-outs and kelp beds.

One of my guests spied a solitary
Minke
on our return midway between south lopez and deception pass in the vicinity of Lawson Reef at

11:40am
. We took turns tracking each other from a very respectable distance zig- zagging an imaginary line toward the bridge. We parted company after about 30 minutes of constant predictable movement.

Pat Ness of Chito Beach Resort, 7 miles west of Seiku, called to report 3
gray
whales off the Seiku breakwater at Olsen's resort at noon.
*
Observing the solo grey spouting and surfacing since Friday (8/24), we saw continued and heavy whale watching boat activity in the bay, the lone
grey
in the SW corner of the bay
