Center for Whale Research staff first encountered several [
orcas
] just south of Eagle Point at

12:23 p.m
. The whales slowly moved north along the west side of San Juan Island, foraging and milling along the way, before turning south again. They tended to travel in small mixed groups of all three pods, with several miles between each group. Some highlights of the encounter include several breaches and a cartwheel from L85, and a very playful group of juveniles from J Pod. Encounter ended at
2:47 p.m.
