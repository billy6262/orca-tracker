Entry 1:
Julie Focha called in this report to the Orca Network hotline: she was on a sailboat south of Half Moon Bay,
CA
at 1 pm & saw 3
orcas
off Pt. Neuvo, heading NW. There was one large male, & 2 smaller orcas. 36 57.93N 122 25.29W.

We had a
humpback
feeding in the 'feeding hole', just east of Chito Point, Seven miles west of Sekiu, for an hour -

4:30 -
5:30 pm
, then heading west.

We did manage to have two
minke
whales cruising near False Bay, SW San Juan Island. Lots of direction changes at first, and then steady surfacings heading south away from shore. The younger minke whale I think is the same one we had last week as "he" would come to the surface almost every time and show just a hint of his mouth and had a very similar dorsal fin. Jon Stern was reportedly out earlier so I'm sure he has an ID on this pair.
