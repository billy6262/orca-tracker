Orca Sightings for August 19, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
A report of a large number of
orcas
about 4 miles east of Port Angeles! And not one or two fins here and there, but a huge line of 40-60 fins simultaneously! There in the mix were so many familiar fins and saddle patches. Ruffles, Mike, Blackberry surfacing at the same time, while Mega, Skana, and other L-Pod whales were in the second group. They seemed to be in a semi-resting mode, bunched so tightly together. As we headed back in, we came across a group of
transient orcas
about 4 miles from the residents. We identified them as the T30's and T37's, and they were on the surface taking long, slow breaths before heading under water for 5 minute dives. We heard that T14 Pender had been cruising around Eagle Point area, but we didn't see him. We headed on up island to False Bay just in time to see Residents porpoising towards False Bay. Once there, they began milling back and forth, waiting for the other whales spread behind them to come in. Soon we had a very active group working the kelp beds just north of the bay, and when we dropped the hydrophone in, it was clear that K's and L's were in the area. We watched as the whales repeatedly swam through the kelp, lots of headstands, spy hops, pec slaps and what appeared to be lots of mating-type behavior with lots of rolling on top of each other and whales being pushed to the surface from below!

We received a call on our hotline from Julie Edwards of
Nesquim, OR
. She (& many others along the beach) watched a pod of ~3 - 4
orcas
, including 1 adult male, off the Nesquim, OR coast (within 1 mile from the beach) for 45 minutes at around
noon
. She said there were also
gray whales
in the immediate vicinity of the orcas, the orcas were repeatedly breaching clear out of the water & lots of flukes coming up, etc. A possible Transient feeding event? She said the orcas were slowly heading N/NW as this was going on.

We just got back and are still downloading photos but we did see the new calf (
L110
) and it definately seemed most attached to L83
*
-as was reported to us.
J's, K's, and the L22's and L87
(and maybe L12 and L85 too) were way out midstrait in the front group and the rest of
L's
were a ways behind them heading north towards San Juan while we were with them from about
1415 to 1515
. We also had a five minute encounter with
T14
near Beaumont Shoals at 1520. The front group hit the west side of SJI but they have not arrived at the house yet (1745) so someone else will have a better idea where they ended up.

The addition of L110 brings the population back up to 87 for the moment. New mother L83 is a 17 year old, her mom (now a Grandma) is L47, & Great-Grandma is L21. We'll be updating our Ba by Page and So. Resident population stats page, and you can go to the Center for Whale Research site for some wonderful photos of the new baby and family!

The
entire Southern Resident Killer whale population
was observed approaching the southwest coast of San Juan Island. The whales were traveling in two tight groups: J's, K's and the L12's in the lead group; followed by the remainder of L-pod close behind. Several recent reports of a new calf sighted in L-pod - from reliable observers along the Southern coast of Vancouver Island - were confirmed by staff of the Center for Whale Research during the brief encounter. The new calf is officially designated L-110, and based on photographs taken during the encounter, Center staff are fairly confident that L83 is the mother based on her close proximity to the the young calf. The first-time mother L-83 is also a summer baby, born
July 27, 1990.
