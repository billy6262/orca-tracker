Orca Sightings for August 16, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just west of Race Rocks off of Sooke Hbr the incoming
superpod
about
1230
pm. Specific whales seen were L 82, L 103, J 1 , K 21, and K11. Great photos with these ids were taken by our naturalist, Jami Nagel, and are on her website under 8/16/07. Many others seen over wide swath, about 4 other smaller boats out of Victoria were also out there. Shane was so proud, said it was the farthest trip he had ever taken, though he had some impatient evening customers waiting at the Anacortes dock. Also saw some
humpbacks
at distance.

We were again in the company of
transient orca
! Both trips took us to the west side of Haro Strait, to view a family of four
in the a.m.
, that turned out to be five in the p.m. Hum! The whales appeared out of Baynes Channel about 10 a.m. on Thursday and hunted their way up the east side of Vancouver Island, over toward D'Arcy Island and then Sidney Island. At Mandarte Island they swam up the west side, and came around the east side, sticking right on the rocky shore, and then turned toward Sidney. They shopped around the rocky area there, but according to other boats they had made many kills before we returned for our afternoon trip, and we did not witness any kills. Many seals stayed put on the rocky shores while the whales cruised by. There was one adult male (T-10 family?) and a female with a tear in the dorsal fin on the trailing edge down low. There seemed to be three whales in this group, and then two additional whales, one adult female and one juvenile. Although the sea conditions coming across Haro Strait were a bit bouncy, the waves set down once across the strait and afforded some excellent viewing of these whales in hunting mode.

Southern Residents
were all spread 3+ miles offshore of Victoria's Dallas Rd in to the Strait of Juan de Fuca traveling eastbound to San Juan Island (at

4:10 pm
). Family groups including the J2 matriline (at
4:44 pm) and other smaller groups in Jpod were in our view this afternoon. All the animals were traveling however we viewed mainly the Jpod family who consists of 25 members. The animals were viewed breaching, spyhopping, pec slapping, tail slamming, traveling, speed porpoising and playing along their travels. There was much variation of activity and was happening all around us all the time. Near the end, brothers Blackberry J27 (1991) & Mako J39 (2003) spyhopped past our stern (at
5:10 pm) at this point we were situated about 2 miles southwest of Trial Island. Hope they got a Salmon feast while away.

This afternoon at

3:30
we had a group of 5
transients
near Mandarte in Haro Strait. It looked like this group included the T10s, including male T10B. There was also a young juvenile in the group. They were winding their way in and out along the shore line and around the rocks and reefs - very different traveling behavior than we see from the residents. There was also word today that all three resident pods were heading back in, and by
6:30 fins were visible off the west side of San Juan Island!

We received this report via the Orca Network Sighting Network, we are trying to get more info. on this sighting, but this is what we have so far - most likely
Transients
: Approx. 5 orcas, including at least one male, sighted at 48.071599,-122.614979 (this is between Bush Pt. & Double Bluff, W. Whidbey Isl), traveling south at

6:45AM
(
these could be the same orcas reported off Double Bluff at

12:15
the same day?
)

Center for Whale Research staff responded to reports of
Transients
in the Kelp Reef of Haro Strait. Upon arrival on scene at

1:18 pm
, staff identified T10, T10B, T10C, T46B and T46B1 (corrected) traveling slow and tight, northbound. After acquiring good quality photographs and ID's of the animals, Center staff left the scene at
1:51 pm.

Two

Friends of ours (Amy & Chris) who are staying in our house on Whidbey Is. just called to say they spotted two
orcas
off Double Bluff, South Whidbey Is. in the Admiralty Inlet. They watched them through a spotting scope and from their description the 2 animals are about the same size, probably not adult males. Initial sighting was about

12:15 PM
PDT.

I talked to Amy & Chris, they watched the orcas for about 10 minutes, between Double Bluff & the buoy just off the Pt, they saw them blow 8 - 10 times, saw two tall fins surface at once. It appeared they were moving from the bluff toward mid- inlet. sb
