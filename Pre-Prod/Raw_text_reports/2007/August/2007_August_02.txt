Entry 1:

We spotted (from the beach) approximately 20
orcas
off Point Roberts from

12:15 to
12:45
. They were heading south and then turned toward Saturna Island. The whales were quite spread out, and one large male entertained us with a magnificent breach.

I am writing from Green Point about half way between Sequim and Port Angeles (Strait of Juan de Fuca). We have several
grays
this week close to the shore also further out from time to time.
