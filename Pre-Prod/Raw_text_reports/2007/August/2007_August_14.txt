Orca Sightings for August 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call on the Orca Network hotline this morning from Terry Jensen, who was Tuna fishing off the
OR
coast. He saw a large pod of 12 - 14
orcas
, with males & females, west of Charleston, OR, between
1 &
1:30 pm
at 124.59W, heading north.

After receiving several reports of
Transients
in the vicinity, Center for Whale Research staff set out to identify who was in the area. The T124's, along with T90 and her calf, were found at

1:21 p.m
. traveling together just off the eastern side of Spieden Island. The group stayed close together and continued traveling east for the duration of the encounter. At the end of this encounter at
2:30 p.m, Center staff continued towards Race Rocks, British Columbia, to investigate the identity of another reported group of Transients Eastbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Approximately 3 miles south of Victoria's waterfront, at

4:25 pm
, the T100's and T101's were found traveling tightly together. At one point, the whales separated, began milling, and then fused together again, with a porpoise amidst them. After making a presumed kill, the transients resumed their eastward travel pattern. Encounter ended at
4:39 pm.

We had a smorgesboard of whales to choose from today. We were distracted by a sighting at Hein Bank of 2
gray whales
! Then we heard reports of over a dozen
transient orcas
coming in from Race Rock heading east (then west, then east again). This was followed by yet another report of another group of
transients
in Speiden Channel! For the afternoon trip, we were fortunate to encounter the northern group of transients passing between Waldron & Orcas Islands in President's Channel. It was a mixed group of six transients, with no adult males present. They were traveling in a very tight group, and were traveling in a zig-zag pattern. Later over the VHF we heard this group had corralled a couple of porpoise and I think I heard that the ending wasn't very lucky for the porpoises. On the way home we saw an usually large group of harbor seals mixed with harbor porpoises in mid San Juan Channel. I can only guess that they had fled the area while transients were around and were warily making their way back into the channel.

9:30 am
