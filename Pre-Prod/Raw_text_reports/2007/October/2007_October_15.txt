Orca Sightings for October 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky enough to find
J pod
passing by Hannah Heights at about
5 pm
. They were traveling south down island, opportunistically foraging, with a few tailslaps, some breaching and spyhops. About half the pod was in a tight formation, with Ruffles trailing. Then Shelmar drove on top of the tight formation, definitely harassing J14 and her family. I know . . ., they have a permit and are doing good research, but, at what cost to the whales. While I really like the research they are doing, this was over the top. Hopefully, there is no prop on that boat. Beam Reach was also out. Wonder what the vocals sounded like. Within minutes, the tight formation scattered. I don't think Shelmar was even able to collect samples. At about 6 pm J pod was heading south towards the Hein Bank area with Shelmar and Gato Verde with them.

J-Pod was inbound near Victoria. Yippee! So off we went, and as we passed Trial Island, we saw fins and slowed down to get some ID's. Turned out we found a group of 4
transients
(2 females, 2 juveniles) that were later ID'd as T2 B&C, and T60's. We were surprised as
J-Pod
was only about 3/4 mile behind them. I don't know if the transients were aware that residents were a short distance behind them or not, but they seemed to move along at a leisurely pace as they foraged in a kelp bed. There was a sea lion in the bed, but either they weren't hungry at that moment, or the Transients decided not to take him on. Shortly thereafter, J-Pod came by in a very tight grouping, almost in a resting-like pattern. It was so awesome to see the whales grouped so tightly, one blow coming after the other. On our trip home we stopped to watch the transients again as they turned and began heading north up Haro Strait. Later we heard that a mini-episode of West Side Story (insert your favorite song from the musical here) occurred as the Transients were chasing Dall's, the Residents gave chase to the Transients!
