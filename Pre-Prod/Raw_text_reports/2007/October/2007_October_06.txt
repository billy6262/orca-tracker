Orca Sightings for October 6, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just had the most amazing pass of [
orcas
] I have ever had the privilege to see along the west side of SJI. Member of
all three pods
just porpoised by, tail lobbing, breaching, cartwheeling- you name it. (The water was pretty rough and they were swimming against a strong tide, so the pass seemed to last forever.) We had nice family groupings in J pod a few miles out--- along with mixes of K's and L's traveling together- lots of babysitting going on as well. It was interesting to see Ruffles traveling with Mega and a female I could not ID... Everyone was in rare form tonight- at one point we watched 7 simultaneous breaches spread out across the Straits. What a wonderful end to such a dreary day!

It took
K's & L's
a couple of hours to get to Lime Kiln, but it was sure fun watching them come. Multitudes of small and huge breaches, a beautiful double spyhop, plus many more spyhops and gigantic cart wheels. The wind just added to the drama with the immense spray that came with every surfacing. They streaked by quite quickly once they got to Lime Kiln. One group came really close to shore.
