Orca Sightings for October 13, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call Saturday night from Lisa Ekers, reporting a sighting of 2 adult
orcas
while sailing Oct. 13th,
9 am
, west of Pescadero, CA about 3 miles offshore. Lat/Long: 37 14.8 N 122 27.6 W. They appeared to be feeding/circling - in the middle of the circling some birds were diving - but she didn't see what they were eating as they were 100 yds. or more off. They were sailing, & about 30 minutes later they came across 10 - 12 sea lions lined up side by side bee-lining toward the shore. Possible Transients?

About
10 in the morning
, while headed south from Roche Harbor along the west side of San Juan Island near Lime Kiln Point we noticed a number of
orcas
approaching our sailboat from astern. As they continued right at us we shut down the engine to let them pass. They numbered about 8 but were well spread out except for two sets of mother and offspring. One lone female was especially curious and went right beneath the boat twice, once on her side as if looking up at us. A mother child pair came close across our bow, picture attached. The other pair stayed farther away. They all left us behind except for a male which led us south for a couple of miles into the fog which enveloped us the rest of the way to Port Townsend.

So there I was near Deadman's Bay. The water was flat calm. The air was so still, you could clearly hear the sounds of blows carry over the water. Loud, distinctive calls on the hydrophone indicated that the whales were definitely members of
J-Pod
. I smiled to myself as I looked up and watched the Milky Way glint overhead. That's right, tonight on my way home from town, I caught the vocalizations playing on my radio (88.1 FM), pulled to the shoulder and got out of my car. I could hear the whales on the radio as well as "in person." Several times vocalizations came from the radio and on the water's surface at the same time.

The Orca Network hotline received a call from Penny Thackeray reporting a pod of three
orcas
(likely Transients) off East Pt, in Saratoga Passage near the entrance to Holmes Harbor. They first passed by heading SE at
11 am
, then made another pass by heading NW, then were last seen at

3:30 pm
heading SE toward Langley.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called Orca Network at

9:05 am
Saturday morning to report
J pod
off the Center for Whale Research, west San Juan Island. He saw J1 heading by south, then a calf heading north off Bellevue Pt, and was hearing calls off the Lime Kiln hydrophone.
