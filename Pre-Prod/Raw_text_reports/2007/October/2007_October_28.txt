Orca Sightings for October 28, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we passed Speiden Island, we got a call reporting a
minke
whale at the Turn Point Lighthouse. I couldn't get an ID on the minke, but he was doing a lot of short dives and every time he surfaced, his jaw came out of the water. Then the most incredible thing happened. We came across a small group of 6-8
Dall's
, who were extremely active and came streaking for our bow. And as we watched these fabulous black and whites, more and more Dall's came streaking in from every direction. Soon we had over 24 Dall's, darting and playing on the bow, chasing each other and almost flying out of the water.
