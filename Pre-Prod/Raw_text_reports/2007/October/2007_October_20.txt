Orca Sightings for October 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Got a call from Captain Ivan letting me know that a
Super Pod of residents
were heading up the west side. We got out to Open Bay in time to see the lead whales just coming up towards Kellett Bluff. Whales were spread out over an area about 3 miles front to back and 8 miles side to side, and they were going no where fast. Lots of foraging activity as the salmon runs are really going full-force right now. J30 Riptide was quite active searching the currents for fish. We let the wind and the waves just move us slowly north up Haro Strait. As the whales approached Stuart Island, we were quite lucky to see J8 Speiden hanging out with three very amorous young males (pre-sprouters). They were rolling all over her, so maybe she was teaching them the birds and the bees? Once north of Turn Point, we were going to head over to Prevost Harbor when a nice group of L Pod decided to eat the fish that were under out boat. Racer, Splash, and Faith repeatedly passed our boat, and we heard plenty of reports from other boats that there were lots of salmon everywhere.

We continued to listen to the sounds of the
Superpod
Sat. night on OrcaSound, first from the Orcasound hydrophone, then at about

6:20 pm
we began hearing calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone as the whales traveled south, & listened to calls for at least another hour.

It was exciting to listen in (via OrcaSound) Seattle today (Saturday) and imagine the Gato Verde catching up to the superpod off San Juan Island on the final day of the 071 sea component. For those who didn't get to listen live, I've added a couple clips to the Orcasound archive: Enjoy! Start with the latest one; it's the best and should be novel as it probably was recorded after team JaMi left the whales and headed for Jones Island.

We tuned in this morning & listened to calls on the OrcaSound hydrophone -

10:30 - 11 am-ish
. Then just now, at

5:50 pm
, we tuned into OrcaSound (n. hydrophone, west San Juan Isl) to more clear calls & clicks! They were heading north earlier, so could possibly be heading south & we may be able to hear them later on the Lime Kiln hydrophone link.

were off west San Juan Island heading north in Haro up past Turn Point. We got out for awhile.

with faint calls on LKL, but not Val's (northbound?). by
8:45 very clear calls (will record from laptop for Courtney's ID later).
