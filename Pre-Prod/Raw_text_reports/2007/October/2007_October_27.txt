Orca Sightings for October 27, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Was out on the boat on Saturday headed for Victoria to see the Humpback Whales, when I got a report from "Quick Change" of Vancouver of five
Transients
coming down Haro Straits. Did a quick "U" turn and found the T-2's cruising along. Great day and wonderful weather.
