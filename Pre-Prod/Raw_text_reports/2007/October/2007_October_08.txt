Orca Sightings for October 8, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
ORCAS!
Lots and lots of them! I guess
all three pods
came in last night (10/7) and decided to hang around the South end of San Juan Island. They spent the morning foraging around South Beach before heading up island. Just before they got to Lime Kiln, they decided to meander slowly off shore and towards the south. Lots of vocalizing too! We had a lovely viewing of all the J16's, and J26 Mike was doing a lot of foraging and spinning around. Towards the end of our trip, all the whales abruptly turned towards the south, heading like they wanted to go to Discovery Island. They began to bunch up into tighter groups. Later on, we heard that only J's & L's were present as the K's were down further southeast on their own. Last I heard, whales were heading towards Hein Bank.

I've just started my Mres in marine mammals at St Andrews in Scotland so have been really missing the whales for the last few weeks. I'm hearing some echolocation and calls! So nice to hear especially since I'm here in Scotland and won't get to see the whales until next summer again! It's 2115 here right now (around
1315
your time).

Was about to hit the sack when a listener in Germany heard calls/clicks on the Lime Kiln stream (OrcaSound) at

2:20am
. Couldn't resist staying up and listening. Will try to post recordings tomorrow, but for now you might enjoy this forum where some ex-OrcaLive listeners log their observations. Based on my listening notes through

04:30am
, I think they are heading north in Haro Strait, but slowly. Currently hearing GREAT S1 calls on OrcaSound, but really need to sleep.
