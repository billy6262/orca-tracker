Orca Sightings for March 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted two
gray whales
at about

4:30 PM
just North of the Clinton Ferry. They seemed to be traveling independently. They were about a mile apart. They were both heading south towards Possession Point. They both appeared to be females. They seemed to be just traveling through and not feeding or playing.
