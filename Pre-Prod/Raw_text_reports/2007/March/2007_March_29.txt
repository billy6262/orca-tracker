Orca Sightings for March 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Gilbert Jackson of the Dolphin Marina at Ft. Bragg, CA - he & his son saw 2 pods of
orcas
. They said one pod was in 150' of water just outside the harbor, heading north fast, with about 40 whales in the pod. Then another pod of about 20 came by, a little further out in deeper water. Sounds like K's & L's - where will they show up next?!

This
evening
from the North Bluff side, we saw a single
grey whale
enter Holmes Harbor. It approached Baby Island and dove and surfaced several times in the same area for around 10-15 minutes. It then headed back out to Saratoga Passage.

I watched a
Gray whale
swimming between the Warren ave bridge (in Bremerton) and Lions Field Park. I first spotted the whale at around

9:30 am
and watched it until 11 am when I left. It was still their when I left. The tide was an out going tide. Towards the outgoing tide it was breaching just slightly out of the water slowly moving w/ the outgoing tide, staying in that position floating w/ the out tide. Them moving forward and then floating out w/ the tide. The whale was staying in between the bridge and the park this whole time.

I spotted a (
gray
) whale under the Warren bridge Friday morning around
10 am
. Looking North from the bridge he was located on the left side between the bridge and the marina. The biker who did get a close look at him said the whale was large.

We sighted 1 apparently juvenile
Gray
approximately

12:25
off Keyport hugging the western shore near the entrance to Liberty Bay (Poulsbo). The whale was in relatively shallow water, moving back and forth leading me to believe it was feeding. This may be the same one seen off the western shore of Bainbridge Island as these places are less than 5 miles apart.

Sounds like Jeff Wonnenberg's
Minke
from Mar.26 in Plumper Sound has gone walk about. A minke at East Pt. (Saturna Isl. BC) this afternoon at
1645
milling but in an easterly direction. No way of knowing who, but? Spieden Island is alive with young animals and green grass for now.

We received a call from a volunteer for the Whale Watching Spoken Here program in Oregon, reporting a pod of 5
orcas
heading north past
Cape Lookout, OR
at
noon
.

A
GRAY
was swimming near the shore of East Point and passed directly below our home. The gray passed right around the tip of the point, within 20-30 feet of us. The one thing I can say is that it was NOT Patch ( as much as I hoped it would be our old friend). This one was much smaller and had very few barnacles, etc., on it. As soon as it rounded the point, it gave us a fabulous fluke display, then headed out to mid channel at full speed. That was the last we saw of it. It was the youngest adult Iâ€™ve seen in our area yet, but it was an adult.

We came across two
grays
east of Hat Island (Saratoga Psg/Posession Sound). Looked to me like a mother and calf @

12:30 hours
. In the flat calm waters we were able to see them very clearly from about 150 to 200 yards. We stayed near them for one half hour and then continued on to enjoy the other wildlife and the islands.
