============================================================

Entry 1:
I watched 2
grey whales

3:30 till 4 pm
, then head southward mid-channel when whale boat showed up.

We saw a [
gray
] whale in Washington Narrows between the Manette and Warren Ave bridges in Bremerton on Wednesday at about

11:45 am
. The whale was about two-thirds of the way across, in the direction of the dock where the derelict vessel "Fram" is docked. It was moving towards Dyes Inlet with the tide. I saw its "breath" and its back three times before it was blocked from view.

Elliott Menashe of Clinton called at

12:45 pm
to report one
gray whale
in deep water north of Randall Pt, S. Whidbey Island, feeding & heading south. He reported a Whale Watch boat crowding it a bit.

I am watching a group of
gray whales
in Saratoga Passage, at Camano View, just north of Indian Beach, closer to Whidbey at

3:45 pm
. I've counted at least 6 of them and they are moving slowly and at the surface. It's been quite a showing. A large boat has just arrived in the scene and they've gone deep. Anyway, what a thrill!

I know that it isn't an orca sighting, but still wanted to let you know that we sighted what looked like a
gray
female and calf just off the Bremerton ferry terminal (near the USS Turner Joy). Looked like a training mission in shallower water.
