Orca Sightings for March 17, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were running along Myrtle Edwards park in Seattle between the grain elevators and pier 91 at about

3:45 pm
when we saw what appeared to be the posterior end of a
grey whale
as it dove. It was very dark, didn't have much of a dorsal fin, and was about 20- 30 feet from dorsal fin to tail. It was heading NW about 70 yards offshore. We waited without success for about 10 minutes to get another look but our sight line did not extend very far around pier 91. Thanks for posting such a cool site on the web; we like seeing what's going on in the sound. Best,
Mike and Katie Morrison

Jeff Wheeler spotted a
