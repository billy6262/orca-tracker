Orca Sightings for March 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I, along with several other people, saw a small
gray whale
in Liberty Bay. We first saw it at the north end of the Port of Poulsbo Marina very close to the shoreline, then again in the middle of the marina, and about 15 minutes later near the Yacht Club marina.

I was at a gathering of my boat owners group ( C- Brats) in Poulsbo on liberty bay Saturday around
5pm
. In the marina was a
small black whale
. It blew once right behind the boat and was then gone. Not sure of the type but was definitely a whale, not an Orca, about 10 people saw it with me.

We did find a group of three
gray whales
milling in Saratoga Passage. All three were from our group of "North Sound Regulars", IDs 49, 56, and 531. This was a private charter aboard the boat the Seeker, operated by Anchor Bay Charters.

We were delighted to see
J-pod
, last seen heading SW off False Bay. No one seemed to find them. We definately identified Granny, Ruffles, and Mike. We're pretty sure we saw Princess Angeline and family as well.

I just got back from whale watching out of Monterey this
afternoon
and I have some photos that may be of interest to you, so I attached them to this email.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research received photos from Nancy Black, & made the following ID's so far: You had K’s and L’s in your encounter today:
L7, L12, L73, L79,L83, L84, L92, L94, K7, K13, and K21
. This was a very important encounter for the record, made more-so because of your observations of feeding on salmon in the afternoon.
