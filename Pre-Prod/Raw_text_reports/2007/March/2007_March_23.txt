============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw two
gray whales
headed east from Baby Island past East Point, Whidbey Island between
6:00 and
6:20 PM on Friday. Swimming casually about 500 yards off shore.

I saw the two
Grays
from the waterfront in Langley. They were way out in the Passage, surfacing and blowing together. I went out of our gallery and told LOTS of tourists about them, and many got to see the plumes of their blows. Unfortunately, for us, they stayed mid Passage and never got close to shore. We were tipped off by what I think was a boat from one of the whale watching groups. They left the area that the Grays were in around
1:00pm and steamed at high speed toward Everett, but the Grays continued down the Passage at a leisurely rate.

At about

8:30 AM
, my parents and I saw spouts right in front of our windows along Stoney Beach Lane in Mariners Cove, near Strawberry Point.(NE Whidbey, NE of Oak Harbor) heading north, no more than 50 yards off shore, probably closer, in stormy rough seas. Ten minutes later,
gray
returned going south and stopped and started feeding right in front of us. It has now been feeding for 45 minutes, slowly heading south towards Polnell Shores/Point.
