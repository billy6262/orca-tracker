*

5:25 pm
. Saw a single whale just south of Agate Passage, not an orca,
perhaps a gray
. First sighting it was probably 200-300 yards off Bainbridge Island. Saw about 10-15 feet of a black back, no fins, seemed to have bumps along the back almost like vertebrae. Spotted the tail fin on one dive. Saw it about 4 or 5 times, surfacing at intervals of +/- 3 minutes. Seemed to be feeding or exploring around the area between the red channel marker and the Suquamish Casino. After 3 surfacings, headed north through Agate Passage. Last seen just past the Agate Pass bridge. (This definitely sounds like a gray)
Charlie Wiggins, Bainbridge Island
*
Jeff on Emerald Moon found a
minke
near Blunden Island. We cruised up there and found him/her moving NE in Boundary Pass.
Azuriel Mayo, Deer Harbor Charters
*
At around

8:30
saw two adults and one baby [
gray whale
] heading north towards Sandy Point. (We are across from Hat Island on Whidbey ) Then about 20 minutes later a couple came by heading south to feed in a cove by the old sawdust mill north of the Clinton Ferry.
Sharon Wandler, Whidbey Island

Today at low tide, it was evident the
gray whales
have been by, even if I haven't been home to see them. A number of "whale holes" were visible on the tide flats in the Mabana area on Camano.
Barbara Brock , Camano Island
