Orca Sightings for March 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Debbie Heischell of Big Sur, California, reporting a sighting of 2 pods of
orcas
on off Gorda, CA between Monterey & Gambria. She said the orcas were behaving like dolphins, in a close group, churning up the water & not traveling in any direction during the 30 minutes she watched them. This definitely sounds like another sighting of K & L pods, who were off Monterey on the 24th/25th!
