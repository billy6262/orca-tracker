Orca Sightings for March 18, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
*
After receiving Nancy's call, I went down to Hidden Beach, just below our neighborhood north of Greenbank, Sartoga Psg., to watch the 2
gray whales
feeding. I watched from

9:10 am to nearly 10 am
. They were zig-zagging in all directions, basically circling around the mudflats of Hidden Beach feeding very close to shore (50 - 100'). It was WINDY & the waves were huge, but fun watching their fins & flukes above the surface, & their spouts blowing in the wind. A great way to start the day!

grays
feeding off Hidden Beach. It's great so many got to see them!

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called at

12:50 pm
to report 2
grays
zig- zagging just south of East Pt. Saratoga Psg (near Holmes Harbor entrance). They were traveling E/SE, so likely are the 2 that were feeding off Hidden Beach earlier this morning.

Entry 2:
The photos have been received by the Center for Whale Research & confirmed as
L pod
whales! Jennifer Saunders called Orca Network to report she had taken a whale watch out of Fort Bragg, CA. At
10 am
they found a large pod of
orcas
(she thought at least 20, her husband thought 40), less than 1 mile offshore, heading SW. There were at least 2 - 3 adult males. L57 was among the 20-40 whales photographed.

Jennifer Saunders called us to report she had taken a whale watch out of Fort Bragg, CA. At
10 am
they found a large pod of
orcas
(she thought at least 20, her husband thought 40), less than 1 mile offshore, heading SW. There were at least 2 - 3 adult males. She said they came up close to the boat, & 1 of the males followed the boat for some time, so she was able to get some good photos. Could possibly be some of the So. Resident orcas still on "spring break"!

11:30am
, two adult
orcas
and one calf were just south of Three-Tree point in East Passage. 46 26.68 - 122 22.92 (N. of DesMoines, S. of Seattle) traveling north. They were traveling, surfacing about every quarter mile. Judging by the dorsal fins on the adults there was at least one,Â­ possibly both adults were males.
