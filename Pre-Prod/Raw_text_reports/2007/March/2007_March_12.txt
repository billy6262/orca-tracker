Orca Sightings for March 12, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got a call from Bob Daman in s. Hood Canal. He lives at Tillicum Beach near Potlach and reported 1 and possibly 2, 25-30'
dark whales
with barnacles on their noses and no dorsal fins but a hump, in shallow water in the area off the Potlatch boat ramp yesterday between

5:30 and 6 pm
. One was spyhopping. They milled around for half an hour or so then headed to the southeast towards the mouth of the Skokomish R. Sounds like wandering
gray
whales to me.
