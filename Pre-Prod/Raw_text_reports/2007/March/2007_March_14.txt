Orca Sightings for March 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Erick Peirson called from Tacoma this morning to report a young
gray whale
swimming up the Thea Foss Waterway in Commencement Bay at

9:45 am
. There was some concern about this whale swimming up such a restricted waterway, and Cascadia Research sent a boat out to look for the whale but as of early afternoon they had not found the whale.
*
Heard blow then saw a lone juvenile
gray
, heading north, very close to west shore at north end of Colvos Passage at
1745
. Surfaced twice passing by the house. Would be about the south end of Blake Isl now.
