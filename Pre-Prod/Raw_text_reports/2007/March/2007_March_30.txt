Noel Goforth called in a report of a
gray whale
in Saratoga Passage at
7 pm
, with 2 sailboats under power pursuing the whale.

I am a south Langley resident and tonite as the
grey whales
were feeding, two sailboats approached them quite closely and they sounded and left the feeding grounds. This was most likely a mother and baby. They were feeding near Sandy Point.

We've known they were back as evidenced by the feeding divots they've left behind when lowtide mudflats are exposed. But this evening's the first we've actually witnessed the annual return of the
grey whales
. Beginning about

5:45pm
there are two whales feeding vigorously about three- hundred feet offshore along the bluffs of First St, Langley, between Park Ave and the west end. Circling about, it's hard to tell how big they are, but one appears bigger than the other. Feeding on their sides, their pectoral fins just about break the water's surface, still, their blowing is loud, and it was their blows that first alerted us that they're back!

orcas
