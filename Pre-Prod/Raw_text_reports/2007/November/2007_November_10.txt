Orca Sightings for November 10, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Listen to the OrcaSound hydrophones now at Lime Kiln (

7:18 pm
). I am listening in DC.
Sharon Grace, San Juan Island
*
Sharon also called to alert us, & we tuned in & heard Southern Resident (
likely J pod
) calls for about 15 - 20 minutes from the Lime Kiln Hydrophone, but then they faded & we didn't hear them on the other San Juan hydrophone or the Pt. Townsend hydrophone, & so far haven't tuned into anything Sunday - sb
*
We've had a large
gray
whale in the feeding spot, between Chito Point and the Sekiu River, with sightings at different times of day, for most of the last week. I was blessed with a full body breach yesterday afternoon, Nov. 9. The whale has been sighted in this area today (11/10), 8 am - noon, so far.
Pat Ness, Chito Beach Resort, Seven Miles west of Sekiu
*
Saw a small
pod
offshore quarter of a mile west of Lagoon Point (west Whidbey Island) today
1000
hours going north.
Curtis, Whidbey Island
In a follow-up call to Curtis, he said: there were less than 12 orcas, no adult males present, & they were moving at a slow pace.
*
At about

12:40 am
, we were listening to the Port Townsend Hydrophone & heard what sounded like
orca
calls, but not Resident calls - we only heard them a few times, then they stopped - possibly the pod seen off Lagoon Pt. earlier in the day? Maybe the pod seen off San Juan Island Friday (see below)? Howie went to the west side of Whidbey & looked for whales in the direction of Port Townsend, but didn't see anything.
