Orca Sightings for November 16, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Mallard just called to say that he's been alerted to
J-pod
coming in from Race Rocks (

4:30 pm
). He reports the whales should just be passing the Victoria waterfront at this moment so he's gone to take a look from shore.
