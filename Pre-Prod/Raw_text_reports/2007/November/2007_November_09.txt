Orca Sightings for November 9, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

11:20 am
I heard some faint
orca
calls on the Port Townsend hydrophone. Then I heard from the Center for Whale Research that Amy & Giles at the Whale Museum heard from a friend of theirs who saw 10+
orca
off Pile Point, San Juan Island Friday at around
10 a.m
. The Center didn't see or hear anything, so am not sure who this pod may have been - maybe there is a pod of Transients sneaking around?

Orcas
(J pod) seen just past Point Robinson headed south in the Maury Island Aquatic Reserve. At least 2 males. More orcas seen and more spread out than on Monday.

Received a call from Courtney Estevenin of Maury Island - she was watching
J pod
at

12:50 pm
, milling & foraging off her beach in the Maury Island Aquatic Reserve, slowly moving south.
*
Received a call from Marilyn Dahlheim - her husband just relayed a report from a tugboat of a pod of
orcas
heading south past Three Tree Pt. at

11:25 am
.
*
Amy Carey of Vashon Island called - she saw a pod of
orcas
off Pt. Robinson at

12:14 pm
, heading south. Amy called again to confirm the orcas were indeed J pod, swimming in the Maury Island Aquatic Reserve near the Glacier Mine site, 30' offshore giving a group of shoreline whale watchers a thrill! They were still heading south in choppy waters.

Courtney Estevenin of Maury Island called at

12:50 pm
to report the
orcas
(J pod) right off her beach, swimming in the Maury Island Aquatic Reserve. They were milling & foraging, still moving in a southward direction.
