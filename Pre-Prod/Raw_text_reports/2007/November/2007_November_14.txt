Orca Sightings for November 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was able to get out to Lime Kiln Lighthouse in time to see
J-Pod
heading south from

1:30-
2:00 PM
. The whales were way offshore (maybe 5-6 miles?) heading towards Discovery.
Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
*
'going to the (LIme Kiln) park' in the other ear. I ran. Got to see
J Pod
, mainly because Ruffles (J-1) could be identified. Miles from shore heading toward Discovery direction. They were definitely Canadian whales today, far, far away.
Jeanne Hyde, Friday Harbor
*
Orcas
mid channel Swanson Channel right now,
0912
, heading south bound towards Moresby Island. Too far away to tell which ones.
Marti Tilley, Mouat Point, Pender Island
UPDATE: At

12:20 pm
I began hearing calls on the OrcaSound hydrophone, off NW San Juan Island. if they are still heading south, they should be audible on that link & later on the Lime Kiln link - Sb
