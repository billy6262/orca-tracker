Orca Sightings for November 22, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
My daughter and I were kayaking northwest of Tolmie State Park (NE of Olympia) at about 74.14 deg lat, - 122.78 deg long, at about
11 A.M.
when we spotted about 4 or 5 large
whales
headed NW from just off the park to where we were. One of these passed quite close, perhaps 30 feet in front of our boats. The fin was clearly much smaller than that of an Orca, but when we did some research on the internet we had trouble trying to match the shape to that of other whales. Our best guess is that maybe what we saw were humpback whales. We got a good view of the fin and it was small, it did not curve back (like a minke whale), and the body was wrinkly. If you have any thoughts as to what kind of whales these probably were, we would love to hear back.

2
Orcas
, one large dorsal fin (male), one smaller, with smaller dorsal fin (female?), sighted between Edmonds and Kingston in Puget Sound over the period of

12:30 to
14:30
. They moved from north of Kingston to South of Edmonds to North of Edmonds to Edmonds. They were just swimming at about 6-8 knots, surfacing every 20 - 40 seconds.The male's large dorsal fin was kind of rectangular in shape, and had a "kink" in it. The male had a large spotty white / gray patch aft of the dorsal fin. My first Orca sighting!

We were sitting in our living room at Point No Point when one of our guests spotted [
orcas
] out in front. They were quite a ways out from the Point. A large (male) fin was seen. They were headed north and were seen about

3:00 P.M
. We didn't get a count of them, but have randomly seen them in this area before.

We saw a pod of
Orcas
traveling north at 47° 52.6' N, 122° 29.3' W (3/4 miles east of Pilot Point - so. of Pt. no Pt, N. Kitsap Peninsula) at
3 PM
. At least two large males were present, one with a large white marking about 1/3rd of the way from the top of his dorsal fin on the trailing edge. They appeared to be traveling rather than feeding although we did see some splashing.

I've been coming to my family's property on Hartstene Island for 27 years and haven't seen a whale between Hartstene and Squaxin Island before - until today, and we happened to be in kayaks at the time! I'm a novice whalewatcher and am not sure of the ID (definitely
not an orca
), but at

4:15
a whale cruised north up Peale Passage past the tip of Squaxin Island. There seemed to be a dorsal fin of some sort, but not prominent. An even dark gray in color. Blows were frequent, low, bushy and fairly loud. I hope someone else who can ID whales better than we can reports this one too! This was definitely an experience to be thankful for! Happy Thanksgiving,

Orca Network received a call from Alex Jon at

12:10 pm
, reporting
J pod
observed from the Edmonds/Kingston Ferry. He said they were spread out from Pt. Edwards to mid-channel, at first heading south fairly fast, then slowing down a bit and doing some jumping just south of Edmonds. He saw a calf with the group on the Edmonds side
