Orca Sightings for April 17, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
KWs
northbound mid-channel near D'Arcy,

16:25
. The whales were in several tight groups, with lots of tactile behavior and very vocal.

1:35 p.m.
. I just spotted a
gray whale
, with lots of white spots on it, moving slowly southward in Saratoga Passage in front of the Camano Island Inn toward Camano Isl. State Park. The water is very smooth, so easy to see and it's the first time I heard one blow!

It's

10:15 AM
and I'm watching 3 maybe 4
gray whales
, just passing Camano Head swimming in a Northwest direction near the shore of Camano.

I watched two
gray whales
feeding for about 10 minutes in Saratoga Passage just west of Sandy Point near Langley this morning around

8:40 a.m
. They were only about 100 feet off shore. Thankfully, they didn't seem bothered by the small boat that sped by only about 60 or 70 feet away from them. The boat didn't even slow down to look at them so I couldn't be sure the grays were seen; I guess it was probably an accident. After feeding, the grays headed east toward Sandy Point at a leisurely pace.
