Orca Sightings for April 18, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
2
grays
of equal size (large) feeding at Mabana Shores on Camano for 3 hours! They stayed in close proximity the entire time. They came at

5:00pm
just as the tide managed to cover the flats, and are still around at
8:30pm.
Dodie, Camano Island

Tom Averna and I were coming in from a wildlife cruise when we spotted an unusual fin near Jones Island. There were two
Pacific White-Sided Dolphins!
They come over and swam alongside to take a look at our passengers. The sea was flat calm and the sun came out illuminating them very well. One of our passengers got a great picture which Tom will post on our website. We called Jim Maya and stayed there long enough for him to arrive.

Two
grays
, one large and one smaller, feeding in very shallow water right at the Mabana Road. Lots of pecs waving in the air.

Cherie McCool of Seabeck called to report 1 large
gray whale
off her beach, just past the buoy line at low tide - she is near Seabeck, between the marina & Big Beef. She watched the whale from
11 -
11:15
this morning, then saw another whale surfacing/feeding at least 3 times across the water from her at Misery Pt. She said they just (around noon or
12:30?) left & were heading south past Misery Pt.

We had a special treat with the appearance of two
Pacific white sided dolphins
in San Juan Channel traveling slowly northwest on this beautiful glassy calm day. The last time I saw these dolphins around here was in 2000. What I found interesting was while we were all hanging over the starboard side of the boat watching them, the dolphins only came along the starborad side as well seemingly watching us. It also didn't matter if I was drifting in neutral or moving forward in gear, they seemed to really enjoy our company as much we enjoyed theirs. Really nice getting eye contact from a cetacean. Makes you feel like you're doing something right.
