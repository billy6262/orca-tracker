This was reported to us earlier as a Transient - sb

Two
grays
spotted by others this
afternoon
- we watched them cavorting near East Point at about

4:30 pm
- lots of surface action.

3:15-
3:30pm
- two
gray whales
leisurely fed close in the shoreline of the west end of First St, Langley. This afternoon they seemed "very blowy"... the especially loud sounds of their breathing were unmistakable and drew my afternoon attention to them. The sunny dry day provided perfect visiblility to enjoy these gentle giants feeding in the shallow waters of Saratoga Passage just below our back yards. They slowly traveled east, toward downtown Langley.

We took our sail boat out for her maiden voyage today and lo and behold, we saw two
gray whales
a little north of Langley where we cast off. They were 'spouting' (is that a word?) and just simply playing. This was at approx
3pm
.

We located a group of
gray whales
in the Boundary Bay/Semiahmoo Bay area at approx

12:30 PM
. The whales appeared to be feeding in the shallow water .... less than 14 feet. Needless to say, we did not see flukes. We did, however, observe several spyhops, whales lounging at the surface and rolling around. During the time we were there, it appeared more whales were arriving from the south of us. Our captain counted 10-12 individuals in the area.

We were in Boundary Bay, just North of Whiterock today with about 8-10
gray whales
, maybe more. They were spread out all around, some close to shore and some farther out. The water was only about 12-14 ft. deep, so the whales were in some fairly shallow water. We saw about 4 spyhops and a glimpse of a tail as one whale disappeared underwater. Another whale was rolling around in the water behind our boat so we saw a flipper as well. It was quite a sight to see so many grays in one place. It was also quite a smell.

Katie from the Center for Whale Research called to report
J pod
had passed by the Center, West San Juan Island, at

3:10 pm
heading north, very spread out. They went out with them in the boat & followed them as they continued north & spread out.
*
The Center for Whale Research relayed a report from Peter Fromm of a single male
Transient
orca in San Juan Channel, near Reed Rock early this
morning
, heading north.

Windwalker Taibi called to report 2
gray whales
- Patch/#49 & another adult gray, putting on a show off Langley Waterfront Park this afternnon. They left at

3:30 pm
, heading west toward East Pt.
*
It's

8:30 AM
and for the last Â½ hour I've been watching 3
gray whales
, swimming mid channel between Camano and Langley heading to the northwest. Later: The gray whales seem to be on the move today or, more likely, I'm spending too much time looking out of the window and not enough at my computer screen. At
12 noon
I watched a gray whale mid channel between Langley and Camano heading east. Occasionally diving deep and showing its fluke, moving right along. Now at

5:50 PM
I'm watching another gray whale, closer into Langley but still in the deep water also traveling from west to east.
