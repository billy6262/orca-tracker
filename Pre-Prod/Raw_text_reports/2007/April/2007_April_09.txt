============================================================

Entry 1:
The captain of the ecotourism schooner Maple Leaf reported seeing a
gray whale
feeding in Fulford Harbour, Salt Spring Island, in the
evening
. He said it was slowly making its way along the harbour and that it was definitely a gray whale.

Bells Beach Just saw 3
Grays
! Two came from the south and at least one from The north, feeding past the buoy line. We watched for about 40 min and then it got too dark.
Peggy Sullivan, Bells Beach, N. Langley

I left
Jpod
2 miles offshore of Eagle Point heading out to Hein Bank at
1600hrs
today. They were grouped up and frolicking in the 4-6 foot seas.
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

Jim Maya called at

2:20 pm
to report
J pod
just south of Henry Island in Haro Strait, heading south toward the Lime Kiln Lighthouse on San Juan Island in rough waters.
*
We had a group of
ORCA
swimming South in Sansum Narrows from about

10:00 â€“
11:30 AM
. There were at least 9, with 2 little ones. (There may have been up to 12?) They were heading I gather toward Victoria and maybe San Juan Island. They put on quite a show by Burial Island, (where a lot of seals haul out) leaping, splashing and slapping their tails.
Tamar Griggs, Bold Bluff Retreat, Salt Spring Island, BC
A guess is this was J pod as they were heading south, the timing would be about right for the sighting off Henry Island at
2:20 pm - sb
*
J pod
passed the Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island this afternoon. We filmed them as they passed mid-strait, and a short video clip is now online at the link below.
