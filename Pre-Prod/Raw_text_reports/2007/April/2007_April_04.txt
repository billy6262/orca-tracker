Orca Sightings for April 4, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Marty Crowley and I were out on the Mystic Sea today looking for
gray whales
. We came upon one at the south end of Gedney/Hat Island (about

2:30 or so
) in the very shallow water by the green buoy. It spyhopped several times, rolled several times and did a blow behavior that I had not seen before. It gave a couple of little "burps" of blow followed immediately by a short (in height) blow of regular duration. It did this at least twice. Maybe the water was so shallow that it was actually lying on the bottom? but I saw no pecs. It was quite entertaining and definitely filling its tummy.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report that 2 orcas were sighted 4 miles out from the N. Jetty Lighthouse on Cape Disappointment.

1:45 P.M
I spotted what I believe to be the baby
gray whale
that has been seen here in Bremerton, between the Manette Bridge and the Turner Joy. It's been surfacing and spouting. I was sorry to hear about the other whale possibly dying. Lets just hope it was playing dead. One thing that I've noticed about the one I'm watching now, is that it doesn't seem very energetic. Almost listless. I hope that that is not a bad sign.

. Lots of splashing and rolling very close to the shore. Headed south down about
