Orca Sightings for April 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

6:15pm
, a pair of
grays
were feeding along Langley's west end of First St.
Sharen Heath, Langley on Whidbey Island
*
My name is Kwasi, I am with Salish Sea Charters. At about
2pm
We spotted a
Grey
milling around just East of Possession Pt. It slowly started to make its way North into Possession sound. I ID'd this one as #53.
*
We found six
grey whales
near Birch Bay, Washington about

1:25 p.m
. There was at least one juvenile with the group. They were feeding (I think) in shallow water near shore. (16 feet) The whales worked close to shore back and forth, and then came further out. They finally started moving south and west. We watched for about an hour. There was a spectacular spy hop, a mini nose hop...and many, many dives, but no flukes showing. (too shallow for such a large whale to go straight down?!) There were also many, many seabirds hanging around. Surf scoters were the most evident, some gulls of course, and then several times groups of shorebirds flew through all grouped up. They were very small, perhaps types of sandpipers?

We were out in our boat just off the shore of Vashon Island next to the Glacier strip mine when we saw a group of about 5-6 small
orcas
traveling north. It was about

3:00pm
. They were swimming north together in a group, surfacing and then diving, surfacing then diving. Not sure about markings - and did not see any large fins.

After discussions with Becca, we have not been able to confirm which species this was, but from her marking descriptions & size doesn't sound like Dall's - sb

A dead
gray whale
washed ashsore near Olympia. Cascadia Research & Orca Network had recevied reports of a gray whale in the Olympia area recently, & are sad to see it come to this sad end.
*
We saw one
gray whale
slowly making its way west toward Hat Island as we were approaching the Everett Marina. This was around

1:30 pm
.
