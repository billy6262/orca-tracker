Jessie Huggins of Cascadia Research talked to Dick Demain, who yesterday morning reported a possible
dead gray
near Bremerton. He saw a LIVE gray whale swimming just north of the Warren Ave Bridge at about 3pm.
*
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called at

6:50 pm
to relay a report of
J pod
coming in off Albert Head & William Head, B.C. He updated us at about

7:50 pm
that they were at Constance Bank.
*
On the last trip of the day out of Victoria, "Radar" found
J Pod
near Race Rocks, a bit west of Victoria. They were last seen at

8:00 PM
near Constance Bank, south of Victoria.

Cascadia Research conducted a survey off the Washington coast. In addition to several
gray whales
, harbor porpoise and fur seals, we also had an encounter with a group of 13-15
killer whales
. One of the animals has a wound on the dorsal fin that may have been caused by a propeller. For photographs and more information on the sighting, please go

Dick Demain, who had reported sightings of the Port Washington
gray whale
earlier this week, called at

7:20 am
to report he was pretty sure it was dead & floating in front of the Bremerton Marina. He watched it float out with the tide toward the Warren Ave. Bridge for 10 minutes, until it was out of sight - it didn't spout or go under.
*
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called at

1:20 pm
to report they were with 2
grays
north of Langley, headed south, then were off Camano Head, S. Camano Island. The whales were following them around, so they kept the boat at a slow speed & stopped.
*
I just got back into the office at Camano Island State Park from what looked like three
grays
, two adults and 1 baby, in Saratoga Passage, on the Camano Island side of Baby Island. We watched them from about

10:00 a.m. to
10:30 a.m
. heading south. Spring is here. There was a metal boat which appeared to be testing for crab that raced right over to where they were which caused the whales to disappear for a while. That was at about
10:15 when the whales came back up they were a little bit closer to Camano Island then they had been.

I saw spouts this morning at about

9:30 to
10:00 AM
. They were south of the Clinton Ferry Dock and they or it was heading south much closer to Whidbey shore than to Mukilteo side. I viewed them from my house in the Chennault Beach/Olympus Terrace area of Mukilteo. I could see the spouts with my naked eye and then grabbed binocs which allowed me to see some blackish whale body part. The spouts were heading the direction of Possession Head and then I lost sight. It was quite far for me to see so I cannot identify a number or even a type but my assumption based upon the spout is that it was a
gray whale
.
Janet Eaton, Mukilteo

Two possibly three
grays
feeding at entrance to Elger Bay from

6:30am to
8:30am
.....and still there as we go about our day.
Dodie on camano

0930
. My first report in a few years of a
Gray Whale
in Semiahmoo Bay, White Rock area.
