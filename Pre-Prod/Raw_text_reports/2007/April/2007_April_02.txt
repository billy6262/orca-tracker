Orca Sightings for April 2, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
One
Grey whale
feeding just north of Spee- Bi-Dah (East side of Port Susan Sound) about 150 yds off the beach. It was the one we call "Trim Tai". This our first sighting this year. However, most of our watchers have not been around much this year.
