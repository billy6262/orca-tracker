Orca Sightings for April 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just saw the baby Gray Whale that has been in the area for the last 3 weeks or so,

7:00P.M.
It was the first time I've seen it in a few days. Three days ago I got my closest view to it. It was about 75 feet from the shore on the west Bremerton side of the Manette Bridge so about 100 feet from my living room window. I love my new residence and the neighbors love my alerts from you alerting me. Thanks. You are much appreciated.

Saw a lone
gray
heading south about in front of The Windmill (maybe a half mile south of Bush Point) about
3 or 4pm
. Breathing loud but quickly, lots of deep dives to avoid fishemen and pleasure boats, none of whom were aware of him. I'm on a high bluff so could see it all. I was gardening and heard it breathing behind me, so I watched until the rain started and gardening was over. He spent far more time under the surface than above.

In Possession Sound, at approximately

2:30 PM
we saw 2
grey whales
. They were traveling north, northeast past the Mukilteo ferry dock. Before we knew they were there they came close enough to hear them blow. We altered course and ran parallel at a good distance for 45 minutes at 3 knots, keeping pace. They were amazing and the most beautiful sight we've seen in all of our years of boating.

At

1:30 pm
, one gray whale was reported feeding off the Langley waterfront, just as the Welcome the Whales Parade came down the street! Unfortunately it was heading south & we were parading north, so by the time the parade ended at the waterfront park it was out of sight, but made us all feed good knowing it was nearby!

9:23 am

At

swam by, feeding along the shore of Langley. They are headed to the southeast and are moving along at a pretty fast pace.

Shane Aggergaard reported two
grays
, #44 & #49 (Patch) south of the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research called to report he & Tracy had been out to find
J pod
off west San Juan Island in the early afternoon - they caught up with J1 & J2, the others were further south & heading south. They then headed west to
Transient
orcas in the Race Rocks area. The T100's & T101's were east of Race Rocks, making a Steller Sea Lion kill, which finished up at around 4 pm. At the same time, T14 was at Race Rocks.

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called at

6:22 pm
to report
J pod
2 miles south of Iceberg Pt, Lopez Island, milling but heading generally east. At

11:04
am he had them 5 miles off Eagle Pt, SW San Juan Island, heading toward Lime Kiln Pt.
*
J Pod
off West Side of San Juan Island near False Bay, at approximately

1:15 PM
, we encountered J1 and J2 (Ruffles and Granny) close to Pile Point, heading Northbound. They turned southbound at about the time we arrived. As we proceeded south, we next found J26 & J27 (Mike & Blackberry), playing rowdy teenage games, showing off sea snakes to our surprised passengers. The real highlight was a little further south, where the rest of J Pod appeared to be resting, and just turning soutbound when we met up with them. Seeing all those females, most with youngters by their sides, was the icing for our passengers. Our encounter was brief, but oh so sweet.
