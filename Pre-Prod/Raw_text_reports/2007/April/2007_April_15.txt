Orca Sightings for April 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
gray whale
for the last week, feeding in the favorite feeding spot between Chito Point and the mouth of the Sekiu River (Olympic Peninsula . He has the white patch along the side of his head much like the whale we observed last spring/summer/fall. We have seen him daily at different times. He has been in the patch for the last few hours today, 4/21 (between
3-
5:50 pm
).

Grey whales
feeding just north of Spee-Bi-Dah (East side of Port Susan Sound) about 150 yds off the beach.

Update to Al's earlier report of
orcas
off Pt. Partridge, W. Whidbey Island: They seemed to be sleeping, tightly bunched for about 1 1/2 hrs. on/near the surface from

6:30 - 8 p.m.
and no interfering boat traffic. They were drifting out with the out-going tide. Last seen near dark about
8:15 with seemingly more activity now off of Pt. Partridge, but quite a way out still.

And now our report, which I somehow forgot to include last night with the others! After we received a call of a pod of orcas off Pt. Partridge, W. Whidbey Island, we headed over to see if we could find them. We stopped at the top of Ebey's Landing bluff, & looked north to find the orcas off Pt. Partridge at

5:25 pm
, heading W/SW toward the Olympic Peninsula. We could see one HUGE fin that looked like J1, & two other large "sprouter" sized fins. Between the size & behavior of the pod, & the above big fins, we are pretty sure it was J pod but they were too far away to get any ID's of individuals. We watched them until

5:45 pm
, when they were getting too distant to see.

We saw a large
grey whale
in Useless Bay traveling south toward Indian Point at about
5pm
. We were in a boat over closer to point no point but clearly saw the whale surface several times and then it dove and we didn't see it again. We happened to be looking at some birds with binoculars when the whale surfaced so we got a pretty good look.

We had a good BW trip, on the Mystic Sea. Saw 4-5
grays
near the south end of Camano. One smaller one had a distinctive underside of fluke - a very bright white edge on the upper right of the fluke wrapping around the point (looking from the underside).

6:30 pm
, about a 1/2 dozen orcas of different sizes, tightly bunched, between Pt. Partridge and Ebey's Landing. west Whidbey. They were traveling south, but now seem to be feeding or congregating near the surface.

We received a call from Sue Zaveruha of Coupeville at

4:42 pm
, reporting a pod of at least 12 - 14
orcas
off Partridge Pt., west Whidbey Island, heading south. There was one huge adult male & a calf.

At

5:20 p.m.
we spotted one or 2
grays
in the middle of Saratogo Passage, between Whidbey and Camano Islands, headed South. Water was calm and they seemed to be heading South, but when we saw the flukes and they dove, we knew they were also feeding. They disappeared to the South in about 20 minutes.

Today we saw two
greys
twice, between Langley and the south end of Camano Island. They were first seen mid-day headed north towards Pebble Beach, coming closer in from mid-channel. This afternoon they were seen again about

4:30
headed south, much closer to shore, moving towards the south end of the island. In their wake were three whale- watching boats and a few private boaters. Thankfully, two of the three whale-watching boats kept their distance, with the private boats lingering behind them. The closest boat, the third tourist boat, was too close and motored closer as the other two stayed behind. Our view to the southeast is limited, but the whales could have been headed towards Hat Island.
