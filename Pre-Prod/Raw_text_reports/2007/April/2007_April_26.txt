Orca Sightings for April 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a message relaying a pod of
orcas
at N45 03, W124 18, at 93 fathoms. This is between Lincoln City & Cascade Head, OR. He said there were 8 or 9 total, a few juveniles with them , sounds similar to the previous sighting we had off Lincoln City recently.

Samantha Hamlin of Olympia called at

8:12 pm
to relay a report from her husband, who observed a small
gray whale
in Butler Cove, off the Olympia Country and Golf Club, swimming close by & heading north.

At

8:00 PM
, approximately five
Orcas
passed through our waters. They were spotted, in calm waters, at the tip of South Pender between Waldron Island and Gowlland Point in Boundary Pass; heading in a South/Westerly direction. We lost sight of them at this point as they were traveling at quite a speed and close to the shore. From this location, they could have headed towards Friday Harbour or to Turn Point. Is it possible they were transients?

to report
J pod
heading north past the Center, West San Juan Island. They went out later in the day to find them, but didn't run into them in Active pass or anywhere up north, & thought they may have been hanging out in somewhere in Boundary Bay.
