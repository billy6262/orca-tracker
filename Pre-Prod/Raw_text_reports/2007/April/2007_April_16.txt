Orca Sightings for April 16, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
5pm
- Two
gray whales
are feeding in the mudflats below our property on the West end of First St, Langley. They were swimming in tight circles, traveling East to West. Then they changed direction and did the same, West to East, drifting toward downtown Langley. By
6pm
we were headed down to The Dog House for their MOnday night $4.50 burgers, and the pair of grays were just ahead of us, giving folks at the back room of The Dog a good show. Pretty soon the grays drifted out to mid- channel, continuing East toward Sandy Point. A lot of bang for the buck at The Dog.

At about

4:50 PM
two
gray whales
were feeding in front of Langley. Interestingly they were headed to the northwest instead of the usual southwest direction. North of Langley they moved out towards mid channel and then came back in to the shore. At

5:45
the two grays started to feed again along the shore but this time moving to the southwest. We saw them again at
6:20 from the Edge Cliff restaurant. They were traveling out in deeper water between the marina and Camano head doing several shallow dives and then a deep dive showing their flukes traveling southwest.

The
T100's and 101's
were around again off of Victoria. I was with them at
1030
off of Constance Bank. They were milling and it looked like they killed at least one seal. I last saw them at 1630 offshore of Becher Bay heading west into a 20 knot westerly.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report seeing 2
orcas
from the Vashon Island Ferry at about

11:30 am
, possibly J1 & J2, but he didn't see them close enough to confirm.
*
Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at
noon
to say there were some
orcas
midway between Alki & Vashon Island, heading NW half-way across Elliott Bay, she could see 2 -3 large male fins. (J1, J26 & J27??sb) At
12:15 pm she called to say Jeff Hogan had a small group north of Alki heading north, & she had another group south of Alki, heading south. Again, no one was able to get a good enough look to confirm, but suspicions remain it may have been J pod.
