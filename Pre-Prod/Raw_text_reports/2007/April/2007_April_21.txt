Orca Sightings for April 21, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had two
grays
pass by East Point at about
6pm
this evening. They were seeming to run in front of the tugboat hauling logs eastbound. It looked as if there was a mature one and one very much smaller - almost reminded us of a mother and child. What a magical sight! A number of us got down to the beach to cheer them on. After about 10 minutes, they turned out past mid- channel and headed toward the Camano side, maybe toward Elger Bay or Mabana.

we observed 2
grays
off Sandy Point between the southern tip of Camano and Whidbey for about 30 minutes. We observed multiple blows, backs and a fluke roll, they seemed to be holding in one spot in a brisk outgoing tide. At the afternoon low, low tide just off Langley waterfront many feeding depressions were visible.

Two
grey whales
spent the early morning in elger bay/camano island. one larger, but more similar in size than the two last week (clearly a mother with a young one last week) they were feeding most of their visit and then, around

9:30am
, headed into Saratoga passage going north.

On an LA Audubon pelagic trip on the Condor Express out of Santa Barbara on Saturday, 4-21-07, I observed a pod of about 8 orcas!!! It was around 2 p.m. near the San Juan Seamount, 120 nautical miles southwest of Santa Barbara. I was able to take a couple of pictures, I hope this might give a clue to the possible identity of the pod. The male's dorsal fin (see above photo) seems quite distinctive (to me). I wish I had more pictures!! They were magnificent. They were swimming around together and then they would come up separately. There was some tail lobbing. I noticed that one of the females had a notch out of her dorsal fin that reminded me of T10. I was unable to capture a picture of her, though.

On the Mystic Sea today we nearly reached the half way point near the end of Camano before we saw a [
gray
] whale. Lots of back but no flukes. Then we had a treat on our return to Coupeville - near the buoy at the outer end of Penn Cove there were 2
grays
with long backs and wonderful upright fluke shows.
