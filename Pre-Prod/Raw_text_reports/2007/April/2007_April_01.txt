Orca Sightings for April 1, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
gray whale
that's been swimming back and forth between Port Orchard Bay and Port Washington Narrows is back. We are on the end of Chester Ave. just north of Olympic College, and have watched him come in and out several times over the past week. The tide is low right now,

2:15 pm
- he usually comes in and out when the water is deeper, but not this time. He is surfacing and diving-- hope the bottom food is tasty, if that's what he's up to.

Entry 2:
My family and I were out fishing (trying to) and came across the 2 or 3
gray whales
that have been frequenting the southeast side of Whidbey Island. It was such an amazing site!! At one point, one of them surfaced relatively close to the boat and we were able to get a photo.
