Orca Sightings for April 10, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched two, perhaps 3,
grays
travel from mid channel Port Susan north to the beach near Spee-bi-dah from

6:30 to
7:00 pm
.

We received a call at

5:55 pm
from someone reporting one
gray whale
in Port Washington Narrows, ~30 yards north of the Manette Bridge in Bremerton.
*
I, along with some neighbors saw a
gray
feeding briefly, (15 to 20 minutes) at
5PM
yesterday, the 10th off Mariners Cove, south of Strawberry Point. This was right about at a .2 low tide. Surprising, as I did not know grays fed at low tide. Always thought they came in to feed at high tide. Even though it was short, definately feeding action going on.

6:15 AM
this morning FOUR
gray whales
came by and fed on the beach in front of Langley! They headed off to the southeast around

7:00 AM
.

This morning, beginning about

6:50am
, I awoke to the sounds of blows from the feeding
grays
at the bottom of our yard (Langley waterfront). I lay there listening to their sounds... lovely to know that in the tens of thousands of miles these creatures travel in a lifetime, they spend some of them right here along the shores of Whidbey Island. Simon says he saw three for sure, and possibly a fourth. We suspect that these are the usual First St, Langley, neighborhood gray whales - the same group that was here day before yesterday. This morning they spent over 30 minutes feeding, and low tide later in the day revealed multiple divets they'd created.

Arlene Soloman called at
4 pm
to report a pod of
orcas
(at least 5 whales) in Village Bay off Mayne Island BC, near Enterprise Reef. The orcas looked to possibly be heading toward either Active Pass or Trincomali Channel.
*
Jim Maya called at

9:35 am
to report what looked like
J pod
off Open Bay, NW San Juan Island. At

10:05 am
he called to confirm it was J pod, & they were off Henry Island heading north.
*
Shortly after
9 a.m
., Captain Jim Maya called the Center for Whale Research to report seeing
Killer whales
in Open Bay, Henry Island. Staff from the Center responded to the report and confirmed
J-pod
traveling north in Haro Strait. The whales were spread out in 2-3 sub-groups, traveling at 5-6 knots, with some percussive and aerial behavior observed, perhaps as part of an effort to forage for salmon.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report that their hydrophones picked up Transient
orca
calls at

2:30 am
off the west side of San Juan Island.
