Orca Sightings for June 2, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J1
(I think) followed by 1 other whale, (heard but not seen), went by at
2020
. 25 minutes later 5-7 whales went by, some porpoising, some slowly moving back and forth apparently fishing. Then at 2140, 2 more whales appeared, moving quite rapidly, followed by 4 more who appeared to be feeding. All were moving in a generally northwesterly direction by Mouat Point, N. Pender Island with the last ones swimming into the fading sunset. So special!
