Orca Sightings for June 13, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Center for Whale Research staff were with
L pod
from

11:06 a.m. to
4:17 p.m.
off West San Juan Island. Although sea conditions were fairly rough, members of the Center for Whale Research did manage to methodically locate and photograph nearly all the individuals present from several subgroups of the L-pod. During the encounter Center staff determined several sub-groups were not present, however, leading them to believe more whales should be expected to "arrive" in the coming days/weeks. K-pod has yet to make an entrance and currently there is no information on their whereabouts. Further information about this encounter and the current status of L-pod will be provided in the coming week(s).

, including at least some of the L12's came in and did the L12 shuffle all day off Hannah and Pile Point. L57, L7 and L53 came farthest north and stayed in a group by themselves for awhile. They were a couple of miles offshore foraging when I left them at

fecal matter. I was able to participate in the collection of the remains of two predations. The first one we had we saw the salmon actually swimming on the surface just before the whale came up and chomped it into lunch. We were able to collect a lot of scales and tissue. The second time the two whales didn't hardly leave us anything but some mush and a couple of scales. It amazed me how much data they can get though from even a few scraps. Sending the tissues and scales in will tell researchers what kind of fish was taken, it's age, and even which river it came from.
