Orca Sightings for June 11, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
northbound at Lime Kiln as of
1100
today. Took the usual route toward Kellet Bluff. We left them angled offshore along the tide-rip toward Turn Point at 1230, and tucked in behind them through Mosquito Pass. Mike (J26) - with his yet-floppy fin - seemed to be immitating Ruffles (J1): generally we'll see Ruffles standing offshore while the others work the shoreline. Today it was Mike's turn to stand watch, perhaps a quarter-mile out from his mother Slick (J16), her newborn (J42), and her other offspring.
