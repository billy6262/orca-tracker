Orca Sightings for June 25, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
A lone
humpback
fed from Chito Point (seven miles west of Sekiu) back and forth for 8.5 hours (
1pm to
9:30pm
) before slowly heading west. The whale would take three-four breathes on the surface, then dive, most times with a graceful tail display.

Approx

8:45pm
we watched a
minke
whale head south in some of the most scenic waters the Straits have offered up this year. The minke was about 1.5 miles off the shores of San Juan Island, meandering calmly south in a beautiful sunset.
Sandy Buckley, San Juan Island
