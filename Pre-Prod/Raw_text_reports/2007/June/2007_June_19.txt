Orca Sightings for June 19, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Wes Childers, who was out boating off Westport WA & saw a pod of at least 15
orcas
, including two males and 1-2 calves, feeding off the north Jetty, heading north.
*
We collected samples (fish scales and bits) from 11 predation events when
J-pod
was up in the southern Strait of Georgia, as well as one fecal sample.

About 2-3 mi SE of Seabird Pt, Discovery Island we watched a
gray whale
travel NW up toward Baynes Channel between Chatham Island and Victoria. We watched it enter into Baynes Channel, make its way west and we left it there at around
1830
.

Following reports of
orcas
foraging near the Fraser River, Center for Whale Research staff were dispatched to identity the whales and attempt to determine which salmon species they were feeding upon. Though the whales were very spread traveling slowly southbound in the Strait of Georgia, staff were successful in collecting salmon scales following a hunt by adult male J1. The salmon scales collected will be analyzed by Northwest Fisheries Science Center to determine the salmon species J1 caught during this encounter. Center for Whale Research was with J pod from

11:13 a.m.-
1:54 pm.

We had reports of
J pod
heading down from the north, off Lummi Island at

3:30 pm
, heading south.

3:30-
5:30 p.m.
-
Orcas
off Lummi Island, very spread out (many miles!) in small groups - heading south - oh you may think what else is new, but they surprised us and a portion of them turned about and headed back north for a while, about as far as our beach (Isle Aire, south of Migley) then turned and headed south again...?? Looked like the group may have been J's (looked like J1 with his slow periscope surfacings on his own way out near Clark Island...) and at least some of the L's (
we had other reports the L subpod was out west-sb
), but I'm sure the whale watch boats will report - the whale pooper scooper boat was also out there with their net tailing a group that came in close to shore including very young calf!

We received a call at
3 pm
, with a report of a pod of orcas (
J pod
) off Neptune Beach/Sandy Pt., so. of Birch Bay. The caller reported Whale Watch boats acting responsibly, but one 10-12' rubber boat loaded with people was up really close to the whales, and she hoped the Whale Watch boats had reported this behavior. (
see above report - this was likely the prey-study research boat-sb
)
*
In the morning we heard reports that
J pod
had headed up to Pt. Roberts, and the L11's (L41, L77, L94 + L25) had headed out west & were spotted off Sooke, BC. Later afternoon reports had J's off Lummi & heading south down Rosario.
