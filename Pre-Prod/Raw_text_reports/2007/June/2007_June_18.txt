Orca Sightings for June 18, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were fortunate to be up on San Juan Island for a day or two, and were staying at Hannah Heights, where we were able to do some great shore-based whale watching!
10 am
we had a small group of orcas who we learned were the L11's just south of where we were, down near Pile Pt, foraging. At
noon
, they were still there - hanging around Pile Pt, but not seeming to go anywhere. Then at
2 pm
, they came slowly north up to Hannah Heights, then turned & went south again. At

4:10 pm
, J pod came ZIPPING by! they passed by Hannah Heights in 10 minutes, in tight family groups. Then trailing along behind them, at a bit slower pace, but in more of a travel mode than they'd been in all day came the L11's, following J's north. We jumped in the car and headed up to the Center for Whale Research - didn't bother stopping at Lime Kiln because J's were traveling so fast we would have missed them, & just as we arrived at the Center at about 5 pm J's were just beginning to pass by, still heading north. We watched them until about

5:30
, then just as J's went out of sight, the L11's came along, still following J's north.

J Pod
came around Lopez Island heading towards San Juan in an absolutely beautiful family grouping. The whales were in about as tight a traveling group as I've seen all year. It was wonderful to be able to sit and watch whale after whale after whale surface in the same area. J16 Slick and J42 were traveling in close proximity to J26 Mike, while J1 Ruffles seemed more than happy to spend some family time with mom, J2 Granny and what appeared to be J22 Oreo and her two kids. As seems to be the pattern, as they crossed the entrance to San Juan Channel at Cattle Point, they put on a small burst of speed, only to slow down again once past the lighthouse.
