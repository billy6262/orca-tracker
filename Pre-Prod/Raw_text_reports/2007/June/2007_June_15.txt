Orca Sightings for June 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a call from Judy Davidson of Sequim - they were in their boat off the Dungeness Lighthouse
5 pm
, and watched a
whale
breach in the distance 5 or 6 times. They didn't want to get closer or disturb it, so didn't have a positive ID.
*
At Lime Kiln St Park many of the
Orcas
swam by right along the shoreline.
Joan Gerteis, Whidbey Island
*
Spotted the
AK pod
(according to the National Park Ranger on board) and another unknown
orca
group near the Chiswell Islands on our Kenai Fjords tour out of Seward,
Alaska
. The fins on a couple of the AK males were enormous! There were about a dozen in the AK pod and about 4 in the other pod. Also saw a mother and young
Humpback
in the same general area.

Staff from the Center for Whale Research responded to a report of whales traveling north along the southern end of San Juan Island. Upon arriving with the whales at

10:45 am
,
J pod and part of the L12 subpod
were observed exhibiting social behavior and slowly swimming in loose groups. Staff followed the whales to Kellet Bluff on Henry Island where the encounter ended at
1:15 pm. Both groups of whales appeared to still be north-bound.
