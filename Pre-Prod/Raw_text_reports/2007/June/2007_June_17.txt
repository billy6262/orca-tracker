Orca Sightings for June 17, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
After seeing
orcas
go by the Center for Whale Research from shore, staff departed from Snug Harbor in research vessel 'Orca' to document the animals present. Upon arriving on scene at

4:15 pm
, the whales were very spread out and north bound in the middle of Haro Strait near Stuart Island.
J pod
was leading while L24, L41, L77, and L94 were lagging behind the rest of the pod. First encountered were J2, J16, J36, and newborn J42. The new baby still appears to be healthy and energetic. After spending a little time with these animals, J pod grouped up in tight formation and continued north in a resting pattern. The four L pod animals turned south and were also traveling in tight formation although they were not resting. Staff continued south with the L's and the encounter ended at the mouth of Spieden Channel while the whales continued to move south at
5:57 pm.
