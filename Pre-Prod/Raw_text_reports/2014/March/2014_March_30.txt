The
T065A's passed through Oak Bay
south bound and headed west along the shoreline of Victoria. We watched them harass a river otter in
McNeil Bay
and then predate on a probable seal in Ross Bay before continuing west past many onlookers at Clover Point. - Mark Malleson, with Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research

swimming west through
Active Pass

I managed to skip out for a few hours to do a midday sea watch at
Bodega Bay
. Soon after settling in and scoping
about
1:00 pm
, I saw spouts about a mile off NW of the head. Just as I was thinking they must be California Gray Whales at this time of year, I saw one whale breach completely out of the water.
They were Orcas!
I counted
around 20 animals with 2-3 males
with the tall large dorsal fins.
The pod slowly made its way south in the direction of Pt. Reyes
. I and many tourists whom I shared my scope with to get them on their first whales, observed the pod for an hour before they got lost in the sun's glare as they headed south. Several breaches as well as tail slapping and spy hopping were seen. Several times I saw Orca swimming belly up!!! Black and white upon their bellys and tail, White around the eyes. Curiously, there were
2-3 California Gray Whales much closer to shore during the Orca passing
. - Scott Carey

12:50 pm -
Unknown caller reports
a pod of 3 killer whales in front of Anchor Bay
(80 miles north of Pt. Reyes), jumping out of the water.
*

9:30 - I'm on Fox Spit Rd on Saratoga passage
and we are watching what we think (after googling information) is a mating ritual. The whales have been fairly
stationary with their fins up out of the water
for about an hour now. Very interesting!! Location: Whidbey Shores, Saratoga Passage -Keegan Porter
Note: the description resembles feeding behavior. Mating is believed to take place in Baja California, Mexico.

We're seeing
3 Gray whales feeding in Port Susan near Tulalip
, headed south at

6:30 pm
onboard the Mystic Sea for our Langley Whale Center fundraising cruise! A little rain isn't dampening our day! - Susan Berta
