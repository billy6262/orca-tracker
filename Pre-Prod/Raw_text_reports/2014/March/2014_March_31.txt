I just got a phone call from a girlfriend in the
Pacific City OR
(between Tillamook and Lincoln City) parking lot. She believes she's watching
an attack on a gray whale by a small pod of transient killer whales
. The gray whale is moving very slowly, in between struggles, on the inside of haystack rock. It appears small, and there may be a large gray whale nearby as well. She sees an unknown number of killer whales. She positively confirmed only two gray whales, which are currently spy hopping nearshore. She couldn't identify any male killer whales. She isn't sure how many killer whales are present, but it looks tentatively between 3-6. She's still standing by with a scope and is going to try and get some pictures and is going to take notes on the encounter. - Michelle Fournet
