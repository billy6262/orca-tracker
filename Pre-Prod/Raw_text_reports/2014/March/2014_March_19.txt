Orca Sightings for March 19, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Possible
gray whale feeding pits at Hidden Beach
(Greenbank, Whidbey Island). They are pretty small but.... not sure what else they would be. California sea lions making racket and basking in the water. - Nancy Culp Zaretzke
*
Spouts spotted off Crescent Harbor
again. Sitting at the NEX cam see spout off in the distance. - Elizabeth Taylor
*
Shari Tarantino spotted some disturbance in the water on at

4:10PM off of Saunders Reef (south of Pt. Arena, CA)
. She quickly shot off some pictures and discovered
at least one, possibly two killer whales harassing a grey whale.
The animals were ~3/4 mile offshore and last seen moving north. Another sighting that day (with likely the same killer whales) was reported by S. Albert. Earlier in the afternoon at the north end of Sea Ranch she saw
3-4 animals heading north
between 1/4-1/3 mile offshore.
