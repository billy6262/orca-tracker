Lantzville beach (just north of Nanaimo), watching a pod of 5 to 6 Ocras
in a tight group, traveling north. They were between the beach and Maude island about 800m from the shore. 1 male and 5 -6 smaller Orcas, too far away to guess at gender. There were sealions closer to shore who were being very quiet. - Duncan Etridge
