Orca Sightings for July 31, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Well July finished with a bang! We got to watch group A of
J pod move from East Point to Blunden Island
. They were quite spread with
"Granny" leading the way
but the best part was watching the
J14's
, who were trailing, interact with one other. The kids,
J40, J45 and J49
were doing lots of coordinated breaching and spy hops......it was awesome! The rest eventually joined in and I managed to get a picture of J37 breaching. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Yesterday while cruising from
Gig Harbor to Tacoma
, we spotted in this
whale
in the distance. At approximately

12:30 pm
, we were in Dalco Pass, near the ferry route. The whale appeared to be heading NW toward the bottom of Colvos Passage. The boater stayed stationary and must have had quite an experience as the whale appeared to dive immediately behind the vessel. - Vicki Brown, Seattle, WA
*
Three Humpbacks on the east side of Fox Island at
8:30ish
. They traveled south from the Day Island area and then turned around just before reaching Chambers Bay Golf Course. Last seen just north of the Fox Island Fishing Pier. Pictures to follow I hope! - Glenn Hansen
*
Well we found the
Humpbacks
in Puget Sound! Sounds like
Point Defiance Park in Tacoma
(5400 N. Pearl St., Tacoma, WA 98407) is the best place to spot them! - Whale Scout
*

10:05am -
A couple of
humpbacks
are just off
Point Defiance
near all the fishing boats! Seen them surface 4 times all in the same vicinity.

10:17 -
They have headed towards
Dash Point

Kari and I saw a single lag (Pacific white-sided dolphin) working the rip off
Smallpox Bay & Low Island
(just north of Lime Kiln State Park) tonight. - Doug McCutchen
