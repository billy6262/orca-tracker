Orca Sightings for July 25, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jon Scordino received a call from Joe Petersen who was out fishing at 6am on 7/25/2014 and reported passing a group of 50-60 killer whales heading into the Straits just passing Tatoosh Island. Joe had reported the Northern Residents to us back in April and he suspected this was the same group because they spotted several large males with droopy/crooked looking dorsal fins. They have some photographs and I will send them on when I received them if any look useful. Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician III, Makah Fisheries Management

Humpbacks continued to dominate the strait today, with
no fewer than 9 reported in the area
! We love seeing humpbacks, and we're really starting to get into our peak season for spotting them. They'll only be more from here on out! We consider ourselves especially luck to be able to see humpbacks at all, given the fact that they were once extinct in this area. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
