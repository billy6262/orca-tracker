Orca Sightings for July 22, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I woke up at 6AM this morning to go look for orcas. No black and white critters until early this afternoon, but I got to share my time with some other creatures. THEN,
J Pod group A and the K14's
started to file by the lighthouse (with Granny in the lead, naturally). K26 Lobo did a fantastic "buzz" by the rocks just beyond the kelp. What a gorgeous fellow he is... - Katie Jones

At
1 PM
I watched members of
J- and K-Pods
head slowly south past
Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island
. They weren't making much progress against a strong flood tide! I think it's time we start keeping track of the whales by matriline, because the pod groups just aren't holding up this year. Present on
July 22 was
J2, the J19s, the J14s, the J16s, and the K14s
. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Noon - 15-20 J, K Orcas heading south today at Lime Kiln Point State Park
, traveling south, also feeding posted a video of about one minute of two orcas that came in very close to the shore right in front of the lighthouse. - Sherrie Stahl
