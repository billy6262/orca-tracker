Orca Sightings for July 29, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
These two have been awfully photogenic this year! It's
J37 Hy'Shqa with calf J49 T'ilem I'nges
, right off Lime Kiln this afternoon. If you're wondering about the names, all the descendants of J14 Samish have been named in traditional ceremonies by the Samish Indian Nation. Hy'Shqa means "blessing" or "thank you" and T'ilem I'nges means "singing grandchild". - Monika Wieland.

Orcas
graced us with their presence in Active Pass twice. One group came close by us on the shore of
Galiano
around
5 pm and around 9 pm
, a second small group stayed along the shore of
Mayne Island
on the far side of the Pass from us. Many boats, ferries and tugs hanging around both groups. - Karoline Cullen.

Whales just south of Henry Island
, San Juan Islands, WA. - Capt. Jim Maya

It looks like
T34
with a new nick. - Gary Sutton

4:07 pm - Whales on the Lime Kiln hydrophone! L-Pod calls
. - Monika Wieland
