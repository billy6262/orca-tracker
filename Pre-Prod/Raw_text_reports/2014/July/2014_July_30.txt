Orca Sightings for July 30, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening from

5:00 til
6:30
I watched the
K14s
(four whales) head very slowly past
Lime Kiln
- in fact they were still there when I left, bucking the strong flood tide. In the continuing saga of the unexpected groupings this year, the rest of the whales that
had come down Boundary Pass earlier
in the day (at least part of J-Pod including
J2, and L87
) went back north up Boundary Pass. The whales (some Ks, some Ls, and maybe some Js too) that spent yesterday hanging off the south end of San Juan Island were westbound in the morning. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
*
From today alongside
Saturna Island, BC
! Was just a stunning day with beautiful flat water, and very happy popcorn type whales! In the course of 30 min, we saw nearly every type of behavior you could hope to see, what a day! - Traci Walter

Ls at Sheringham Light, near Sooke
. - Sooke Coastal Explorations.

passing our place on

"Look Mom! I can walk! I can fly! I can blow bubbles!"
Echo, J42, today in Boundary Pass
, just north of Stuart Island, San Juan Island, WA. - Capt. Jim Maya
*

10:00 am
- We spotted
two orcas
a half mile off Gordon's Beach (Strait of Juan de Fuca,
between Otter Point and Sheringham
, about 20 miles west of Victoria). They appeared to be feeding. They were working the same deep water dropoff the fisherman work religiously out here. - Robert Johnson
*

8:09pm -
Spotted
a pod off the southeast side of Whidbey
- can see them across the sound from Richmond Beach. Beautiful! - Jacquelyn Hanson

Just south of

two humpbacks

A humpback at Turn Rock in San Juan Channel
