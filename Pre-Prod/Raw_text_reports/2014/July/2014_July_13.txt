Orca Sightings for July 13, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
K-Pod
continued to do the
west side shuffle
today. Between

10:20 and
10:40 AM they went north past Lime Kiln Point State Park
, got as far up as Open Bay, then turned and came back south
past Lime Kiln around
12:30
. They also poked their heads as far north as Lime Kiln at
8:45 PM before turning and going back south. Meanwhile,
J-Pod spent the whole day up north
, with the
J16s coming down Boundary Pass and going back up Swanson
, while the
others by all accounts stayed near the mouth of the Fraser River
throughout the day. While we've had residents around on almost a daily basis for the last month and a half, it's interesting to note
there have been changing groups of whales here every week or so
. Since they all went out west on
July 8th, for instance, there's been an interesting combination of whales in inland waters. For those "keeping score", present from
July 9th onward in inland waters are K-Pod (minus the K16s and K21), L87, and from J-Pod J2, the J14s, and the J16s (no J19s, typically part of "Group A" in the past). It's easy to report "Js and Ks are here", but I think it's equally interesting that we're ending up with new and different combinations of whales all the time. It's been difficult but fascinating to keep track this year as we're seeing all kinds of new groupings! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Orcas passed the south end of Lopez around
5:30pm
today, cruising east to west. - Sally Reeve
*

5:00 PM - 6-8 Orcas
traveling east to west about 300 yards from
Thieves Bay, North Pender Island
, in Swanson Channel (about 9 miles NNW of San Juan Island). Too far away for good pictures. Noticed one very large dorsal fin. Moving at a good speed. Not much time for play, feeding. - Ken Plato

Watching
a humpback pass within 50 yards of the orcas (Hannah Heights, San Juan Island)
. Just another day in the life, right? Very cool. - Sandy Buckley
