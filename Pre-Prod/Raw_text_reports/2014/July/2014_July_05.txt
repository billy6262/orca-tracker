Orca Sightings for July 5, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
The story of the coolest thing that happened yesterday, the only time it's happened to me anyhow! So we're heading down to these resident orcas in the morning and can see the pile of whale watch boats still a mile or so off, when we come across
Onyx all by his lonesome
. So we pause and watch him for a couple minutes, then slowly tiptoe out of range and pick up a little bit of speed to go join the other boats and whales ahead. I was on the back deck talking about Onyx to the only 4 passengers who were back there, because we could still see him surfacing way behind us. All of a sudden, two whales exuberantly pop up just behind and to the side, surfing the boat wake! It was
J37 Hy'Shqa and J49 T'ilem I'nges
. I holler at the captain to cut the engines, and he complies immediately, but as we drift to a halt, the wake continues and the orcas keep porpoising along in it. They slowed right down with us and then surfaced beside us twice as if to say, 'why'd you stop? that was fun!' Were they just playing? Or using us to catch up with the other whales ahead? T'ilem I'nges slapped his tail a couple times, and then they moved on, continuing in the same direction we had been going. Didn't get much of a photo of the surfing, of course, with a long lens on +

SURPRISE!

/too much glee to function. The boat was already shut down and drifting when this first shot was taken. - Andy Scheffler

I just saw my first ever
greeting ceremony by the southern resident killer whales. J, K, and L Pod
s all circling, breaching, surface vocalizing, spyhopping etc etc and all within view of our boats!! Everyone came out, shut our motors off and just watched in awe as some of the most spectacular, magical, and social behavior that we have ever seen unfolded before our eyes. Probably the best day of my life. - Heather MacIntyre

Another EPIC day out there. EPIC, I SAY!
Superpodage
and all the goodness that goes along with it. J16 Slick, J36 Alki, and J42 Echo were nuzzling each other right before the great meet-up.- Katie Jones

3:30 - dispersed orcas
traveling slowly west past
Flint Beach on the south end of Lopez Island
. - Tom Reeve

This afternoon starting around

1:30pm 18 - 21 orcas
greeted us on the
south side of San Juan Island
just as we headed north into Haro Strait. Looked like orcas from
J, K & L pods
. I counted 3 juveniles, 1 calf, 10-12 females and 4-5 males in all. Playing and traveling spread out a bit then coming together. One female breached repeatedly, as well as one of the juveniles breached twice, once completely clearing the water. Some tail lobbing also observed. It was truly amazing as they kept appearing and coming in close as we bobbed along. An amazing sight! - Brittany Foxley

Oh, THERE the Residents are! Members of
all three pods
showed up on the west side (around
noon
)! Here's a huge breach from K20 Spock, one of three she did in a row. Many more photo highlights later including a whale with a fish and some K-Pod close-ups. Despite the drizzle it's been a great day at Lime Kiln! At
7:15 this morning 4 transients made their way north in Haro Strait, then from noon til
1:30 members of all three Resident pods went north, then south, some of them quite close to shore. - Monika Wieland
*

1:43 -
OMG. And I dont say OMG that easily. Amazing pass just now- whales heading south close to shore (
Hannah Heights, ~5 miles south of Lime Kiln State Park
), rolling, mating, breaching, tail lobs--- water totally flat and their blows were like one of the best story board soundtracks on earth. WHAT A SATURDAY!!! - Sandy Buckley
*

12:17pm - calls on Lk
under the boat noise. - Selena Rhodes Scofield
*
Transients eastbound at Constance Bank
. - Josh McInnes
*
My first glimpse of the water this morning including this tall dorsal fin in the distance! I thought at first it must be residents off of Lime Kiln, but instead it was a family group of
transients making their way north in Haro Strait
. I was out there for a few hours while the sunshine faded to rain, but no more orcas came by. - Monika Wieland
