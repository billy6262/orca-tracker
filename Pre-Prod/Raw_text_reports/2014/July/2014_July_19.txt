Our Saturna Island Marine Research Education Society put on an event just yesterday at
East Point, Saturna Island
with divers from the marine life sanctuaries society etc. At about
2 p.m.
, as if on cue all of
L-pod
showed up just off the beach
heading east in Tumbo channel out into Boundary Pass
. We had a spectacular showing of porpoising, breaching and general cavorting and no vessels following them, it was absolutely magical. In the 33 years I have lived on Saturna, I have never before seen the southern residents in Tumbo channel......amazing. - Robert Bruce

We had unusually high winds up north today which prevented anyone from finding Resident type Orcas this morning, although there was plenty of other wildlife to be seen. Then early this afternoon
10 Bigg's Killer Whales, Transients T137s and T124As, popped up in Rosario Strait
, and ended up coming almost to Friday Harbor by this evening. - Ivan Reiff

15 orcas in Thatcher Pass

sometimes travels with another male, TO49C who has a very similar notch in his dorsal fin. When they are together, they are known as "The Twins." They spent a couple weeks in central and south Puget Sound earlier in the year. - James Gresham

Male Transient Killer Whale,
T137A
breaching. He must have breached 10-15 times. They were raising havoc with the seals today. Anacortes in the background. We were real close to home. We were with them for a long time. Over 3 1/2 hrs. They must have killed 5 or 6 while we were there. We left them as they
headed towards Thatcher Pass
