============================================================

Entry 1:
The
Southern Resident Killer Whales headed west
, but we were able to see
Transient (Bigg's) Killer Whales that were near Friday Harbor today
! This Killer Whale seemed to try and flush the seal off the rocks, and the seal stayed put. Smart seal! Another seal later on was not so lucky. - Traci Walter

7:20 PM - Orcas sighted off Southwest of Rosario Beach,
Northest of Smith Island. Spotted a group of
four or five orcas
between Rosario Beach and Smith Island. Looked to be one male and three females. They were heading southwest toward Smith Island. They appeared to be traveling at a steady rate. They did not change route or pause for antics, but rather traveled. The male was about 300 yards south of the females. The orcas were too far away to determine identities. One male and two females with one juvenile. - Chanel Giles

whale crisscrossing back and forth approx a square mile. Behaviour- taking four breaths and then sounding (rolls on left side and then no more breaths for four to five minutes). Last time there were seven spouts! - Janet Russell
