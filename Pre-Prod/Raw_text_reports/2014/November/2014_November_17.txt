Orca Sightings for November 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
From

10:45-
11:30
we watched some very spread out
residents
head slowly south in Haro Strait offshore of
San Juan County Park
. Whales were foraging and doing long dives, but I saw for sure
J2, K21, L72 and L105, and L84
. After passing the west side at night several times, it was awesome to finally have the residents come by during daylight hours! With the whales so spread, however, it was confusing trying to figure out who was where and it sounds like the rest of J-Pod was MIA during that time, until being heard on the hydrophones overnight between the 17th and 18th. -Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

I saw
K pod off the west side of SJI
this morning!!! Although,
all three pods
are here. Huge thank you to everyone who helped keep me informed!! - Heather MacIntyre

Today was pretty amazing. I had been staying on Stuart Island for the past couple days and I knew the Southern Residents had gone north. Hoping for a return trip down past San Juan Island, we took a chance and went out at
8:30am. We scanned north and turned to
Turn Point
to look down and we came around the corner and
there they were
! I'm not sure if all
members from all 3 pods
were there as they were super spread and doing longer dives, but it was amazing. We were the only boat out for a long period of time. We followed along until
Kellet Bluff
where we got to see some good fishing action! The Center for Whale Research also was out today, so I'm hoping they could confirm everyone was there. Beautiful day on the water! - Traci Walter
