============================================================

Entry 1:
We just left
J & K pod on the east side of Constance bank
heading west @
4pm
this afternoon spread out about 1/4 mile ~ their traveling speed varied from porpoising at speed, followed by foraging behaviour then back to porpoising. -BC Whale Tours

Just got back to the house after an amazing encounter with resident orcas!! Went out looking for them with some friends and found them over
between Eastern Bank and Dungeness Spit.
They were very spread out and headed northwest when we left them around three: It was
J and K pod
, including the
K16's and K21, and L87
. Did not see the J17's or J11's (easily could have missed them) but did see
J38 and the J16's
. Lots of very energetic foraging/chasing and we saw
L87 and J49
both with salmon in their mouth. Lots of breaches, spy hops, tail slaps, and general goofing off.
J2
was being followed by
J38, K38 and K44
who were being quite social with each other. Got a good shot of K44's new nicks. Happy to be home!! -Melisa Pinnow

Victoria Clipper is going much slower than we usually see it... light rain. There! Behind the Victoria Clipper. Oh my! The tallest dorsal fins we have seen. Wow!
Five at once
. Magical, mystical, mesmerizingly hypnotically pulling all the senses. They are spread out for a quarter mile, maybe more on the Port Townsend side, but far enough out we can see them. Two with tall fins, many... as they get to Protection Island for a background they spread out, hopping once or twice... the two big fins seem farther apart. Westerly or northwesterly, splitting into two pods or not, we could not tell. Thank you, thank you, thank you. -John Morelock
