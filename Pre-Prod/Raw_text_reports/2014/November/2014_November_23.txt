Orca Sightings for November 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
A pod of orcas was first sighted at the south end of Anderson island
this morning around

8:30 am
chasing a food source and approximately at

9:30 am
. The pod of
four to six whales
was
between Anderson and Ketron island
slowly moving north feeding going all directions. One of our island residents who filmed the whales almost a year to this week came over to my location and got two videos of the whales again. I uploaded some still shots at two facebook sites- mount rainier and south sound views from Anderson island, and Anderson islanders site. -Robert Lyden, Anderson Island wa.
Note: These have been tentatively identified as the T137s
.

12:35 PM - Large group of Orca
swimming north up the
west side of Saragota Passage.
Seen from Cranes Landing Drive,
Greenbank
. No idea exactly how many, if I had to guess I'd say around twenty? At least one male, might have been two. Saw one big splashng event which could have been feeding but other than that and one nice jump they were just cruising up the passage. -Scott Rosenkranz
*

11:00 AM - orcas in Saratoga Passage
heading north past Bells Beach, saw approximately
5-6 Orcas
including one young Orca. They appeared to be feeding. -Alan Cohen
*

1:28 pm -
They were big spouts as we saw them without binoculars about 2 to 3 miles from us looking from
Gig Harbor
towards Brown's Point. I think they were moving towards
Port of Tacoma
or north--we lost them again.

12:37 pm -
A few more blows--same area
between Point Defiance and Vashon
!

12:29 pm -
Saw 10 to 12 blows and flashes of dorsal fins briefly just north of
Point Defiance
near the tug pulling logs. about 30 minutes ago and then they were gone. -Michele Riley Campbell
*

12:07 pm -
heading south fast.

11:30 am -
We're seeing them due west of
Chambers Bay golf course
midchannel at least three or four just kind of thrashing around. -Peter Woodward

Thanks to orca network we were able to see orcas off of
Chambers Bay
this morning!!! I'm always in awe of these beautiful whales- every time I see them I'm so excited I jump up and down with glee! -Julie Merriam

We are having a great whale year here in
Gig Harbor
. In August and again two weeks ago we got to see a
humpback
. Today some
orcas at
9:45 this morning
, close to shore on the Gig Harbor side of the Narrows, just about 1/4 mile north of the bridge. They were heading south. -Susan Dynes

half dozen or so SRKWs
head northwest past

as the rain is rolling back in and visibility is about to drop to zero.

8:17 am - Orca south of PT Coupeville ferry run heading north!
Thanks Gayle for confirming what I was hearing. -Connie Bickerton

4:04 pm -
a group of
orcas
that were going south into
Holmes Harbor south of Greenbank farm
have now turned around and going north toward the Farm...assuming they will be turning east. Don't quite know. but just got in from watching them across Holmes Harbor. They didn't quite get as far as Dines Point and turned around.

3:32 pm -
Orcas are in front of Greenbank Farm with Baby island to its east! They are a happy bunch out there....thanks Rachel Haight for the post..........WOW. -Marilyn Armbruster

Around
3 pm I was on North Bluff Rd across from Cama Beach
. Kept hearing multiple blows but didn't see any one thru the trees. -Kathy Fritts
*

3:14 -
Now south of
Hidden Beach
, about a mile north of Greenbank Store and Grille. Looks like heading into
Holmes Harbor
. Maybe due north of baby island heading south east slowly.

2:43 pm -
They are
north of Hidden Beach
still. Heading this way finally. I think they slowed to eat! Finally moving steady south again. I saw a breach as they came around the corner when I was about to give up! Close to Whidbey side too. -Rachel Haight
*

1:45 -
Looks like they've turned back south .... perhaps heading slightly to the west, estimate nearing the
north end of Cama Beach
.

1:18 pm -
They're still heading north, looks like about 8 in 1 group and a scant views of one or two other individuals. They're
across from Race Lagoon
(roughly) now.

12:44 pm -
They're off Cama Beach right now, still heading north (YAY)! -Jill Hein

I am back to report, orcas everywhere... most have gone up north past
Cama Beach
... looks like a couple
went south down Holmes Harbor
, orcas spread across the sound, close to both sides. -Marilyn Armbruster

Just saw at least
3 Orcas right off of Fox Spit, Saratoga Passage
, can't tell direction because they seem to be milling. -Stephen Merritt

11:04am - Residents heading north in Saratoga Passage
, spread out mid-channel opposite Bells Beach. A big treat on a sunny November morning! -Brooke Nelson
*
We saw
Orcas traveling north in Saratoga Passage
(about 3 miles north of Langley) this morning at about

10:55
. It looked like either one large pod of 8+ or two smaller groups both swimming north, one near to Whidbey and the other about half way to Camano. We'll try to keep an eye out in case the orcas heading south from Deception Pass swim by! A few slightly blurry shots in case anyone is interested in identifying the individuals. -Jonathan Bent
*

10:47 -
There is a glorious pod of orcas in the
Saratoga Passage off Langley beach
right now. I got some shots but wanted to get the word out. They are heading west along Langley shore. We saw whale spouts the morning of Tucker's celebration of life and I thought our pal had returned for the day. Was thrilled to learn his grand kids saw them at the same time as well. Like I said, glorious. Other photos here. -Debra Campbell
*

10:45 am -
watched a small pod
north of Langley traveling north
from Langley Whale park. Then we had our first guest of the morning at the Langley Whale Center who'd come here after seeing the whales pass. He said there were at least two males. No id confirmation. -Connie Bickerton

10:36am - 5 Orcas
heading north right by Inn at
Langley
, Langley. -Kim Dunkley Wetherell

About

10:30
this morning, spotted
approx. 5-6 orcas
spread out
across Saratoga Passage
heading north
from Langley to Mabana to Fox Spit.
At least one male. They seemed to be feeding on the current lines. Orcas, bright sunshine, newly snowy Olympics- beautiful! Barbara Brock

This morning about
9am
, a larger group spread out came from the east, went past the
Hat Island marina
again, heading north west. What a treat!! -Barbara Conwell, Hat Island Harbor Master

We spotted them earlier headed north in
Saratoga Passage
. This pic was taken just after 3 pm when they returned, headed south in the Passage off
Greenbank
. So exciting! -Cindy Dean Prahl
