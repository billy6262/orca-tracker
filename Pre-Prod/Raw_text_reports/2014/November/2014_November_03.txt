Orca Sightings for November 3, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sighting of
a single Orca off Sierra on the west coast of Whidbey Island
. At approximately

11:35 am
on 11/3 directly out of our window which faces NW from Sierra (near Coupeville, west side of Whidbey Island). We live on the bluff. It was heading South toward Partridge Point. I only saw it 2x's during its journey. I had to use the binoculars to identify it, but initially I saw some white like a spray and then grabbed the glasses to see it break the water. Initially heading NW and the next time SW from our home. - Rosemary Denson

Hat Island Marina
, saw a blow & tail flip a couple times. Not close enough to see a positive identification (this was believed to be a humpback). Headed NW around Hat Island. - Barbara Conwell
