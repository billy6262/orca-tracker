Orca Sightings for November 29, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
The orca that was found dead
December 4 at Bates Beach near Comox, BC, was
Rhapsody J32
.... I saw her just a few days ago during my encounter with J and K pod on
November 29th, 2014....here is a shot of her from that encounter (See Photo of the Day), she is the farthest right. Also pictured is the rest of her small family, her aunt J22, and her two cousins J34 and J38. This may very well be the last photo of Rhapsody while she was alive.
The Southern Resident orcas are now down to 77 members... -Melisa Pinnow

Saturday morning of Thanksgiving weekend... very windy and cold, but the sight of
3 Orcas
traveling west between
Crane and Shaw Islands
(north of San Juan Island) drew us outside. A short time later, we sighted
7 or 8 more
, again going west through Wasp Passage. We didn't see the first group soon enough to get a good photo, but a photo of the second group is attached. Based on the photo, there were 2 males in the second group. -Cynthia Hertlein

12:10 - 8 to 10 orcas in Case Inlet
(or Nisqually Reach),
between Johnson Point and Anderson Island
(13 miles SW of the Tacoma Narrows bridge), breaching and milling. Not traveling. Leslie Demich.
My wife, Leslie, called you on Saturday to report an
Orca sighting in Case Inlet
. Per your instructions I tried for dorsal fin photos. While it seems to me there is sufficient evidence here to confirm the creatures in question are Orcas, unfortunately they were too far from shore for my lens to get much detail. I estimate they were about a half mile off shore, based on Case Inlet being about two miles wide from Johnson Point to Anderson Island. They were paused in front of our house when Leslie first spotted them, then moved slowly southward with an accompanying flock of seagulls to help locate them. They paused again perhaps a mile south of Puget Marina, a few circling back almost to our location once or twice, then left the area heading generally southeast toward Luhr's Beach. -Gary and Leslie Demich

3:53 -
Just left
Tolmie
. Spent over an hour there. The distortion is terrible, but
blows
were visible. There was a boat near them, but because of the distortion, that's all I can relay. It's just too cold to stand out there for long! Plus I had zero service. -Jessica Pagan

1:35 -
Lost sight in the chop. However, they're headed toward
Nisqually Wildlife Reserve
past the
southern tip of Anderson Island
.

1:15 -
"Seeing them hunting seals between
Anderson Island
and Tolmie State park. Just saw a seal being tossed into the air".

12:30 -
From a friend of mine, Carolyn Logue - "ORCAS heading south in
Nisqually Reach toward Tolmie State Park
." -Kim Merriman
