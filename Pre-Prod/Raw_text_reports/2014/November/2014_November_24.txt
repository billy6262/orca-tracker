Had a great day tracking
Southern Resident
whales today. Got a call from my good friend Amy Carey, and messages from other friends..Karie Olson Sherman, Alisa Lemire Brooks, that whales were reported south of Vashon. I headed out with the baby to check it out. Three times I almost turned around to go home, but something told me to go. They turned around 3 times to head down the Narrows. After a little game of back and forth the orcas finally decided to head up
Colvos Passage
. I tracked them all the way up the passage, and finally got to see them up close. I got some Id's but I think there were more that I missed in that moment. Still grateful for sharing the experience with the kids. Hope to see more whales soon. -Kelly Burns Keenan

HI !!!! Very excited to report
4 orcas swimming very slowly westbound out of Commencement Bay
towards the Vashon Island Ferry. Feeding? Traveling was very slow. -Sue Duncan
*
At about

10:45
we spotted killer whales (looked to be cow and calf) off of Old Town Park / Jack Hyde Park in
Tacoma
- we could see them from our offices. They were right in close to shore. They stayed in the general vicinity for about 15 minutes, moving offshore to about halfway between here and Browns Point. At that point we noticed at least 1 and possibly 2 other individuals, including an adult male. They milled for a bit and took off toward the Narrows. It was quite a treat for us biologists. -Melora Shelton

2-3 orcas off Piner Pt., Maury Island, seen at
10:30 am
, moving slowly west, reported by Jim Lilje.
*

10:24 AM - Orca Pod - Tacoma
. I first spotted
6-8 orcas
heading towards
Commencement Bay
, then a boat went by and they turned, slowly heading west such that they are now between Tacoma's Northern waterfront at
11:10 am (Katie Downs restaurant) and Quartermaster Harbor. My guess is they were feeding. Seem to not be in a hurry to go anywhere. They charged - like they were just plowing the water - several times. -Mollie Heilesen

Possible Transients:

10:19am - The Orcas are between Anderson and Ketron Islands
. Sunny Pepin

Taken between

9:45 a.m. and
10:17 a.m
. today. From aboard the ferry,
between Ketron Island and Anderson
Island from a 400mm lens. -Sean Griffin

This morning I was fishing around
Pt. Defiance
when the orcas were around. The
Pacific White Sided Dolphin
was over by the lighthouse this morning too. Only 4 Harbor Seals instead of the large group were there today, all small ones. A helicopter was flying over the whales. -Bryan Owens, Tacoma Wa.

Possible Transients:

8:41 am -
Just spotted a pod of about
4-5 whales just north of the Riviera Club marina on Anderson island
, heading north. It looks like they are feeding at this time. -Maryann McConville Schuler
*
Possible Transients:
A pod of orcas was first sighted at the south end of Anderson island
this morning around

8:30 am
chasing a food source and approximately at

9:30 am
. The pod of four to six whales was between Anderson and Ketron island slowly moving north feeding going all directions. One of our island residents who filmed the whales almost a year to this week came over to my location and got two videos of the whales again. I uploaded some still shots at two facebook sites- mount rainier and south sound views from Anderson island, and Anderson islanders site. -Robert Lyden, Anderson Island wa.

Orca Sighting: One (1) LARGE Male feeding in vicinity of
Guardian Bank, Costa Rica

3:30 -
I saw at least
2 fins
yesterday as I was driving across the Purdy Spit (north end of Henderson Bay,
west of Gig Harbor
, south Puget Sound). Traffic started to bog down and people were looking into the bay. I looked in time to see the fins disappear. 1 fin looked large. -J. Matthew Phipps
*

1:30 - Gig Harbor
area sighting. We were checking out the beach at Sunrise Beach Park just East of Gig Harbor and saw a pod of
8-10 Orc
a whales moving north in the sound about half way (or maybe closer to West shore)
between Gig Harbor side and Vashon
. They popped up about every 30 seconds and we could see the dorsal fins clearly as well as the blow hole spray. We even saw 4-6 large seals that were moving south at the same time and veered inland toward us maybe to avoid the orcas. I have some mediocre video if you want me to share later. -Fritz Grueter
