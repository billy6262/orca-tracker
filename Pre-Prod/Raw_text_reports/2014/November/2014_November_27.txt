Orca Sightings for November 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a
small group of orcas (5-7)
off my bluff (about half way
between Clinton and Langley
) It was around

11:30
and they were heading south. Very fun to see them on Thanksgiving Day! -Frances Wood
*

4:25 pm - from Marina Beach, Edmonds
, saw one breach north of Apple Cove mid channel, or just west of. This was the last I saw of the SRKWS before darkness fell on this stormy beautiful Thanksgiving day.

3:40-
4:10 from Edmonds
watched
two groups of 4-5
(one of which was approx 1 mile from shore) traveling in tight groups east of mid channel at steady pace committed to southbound Puget Sound. At the same time I was seeing an occasional single whale and smaller groups spread across the channel to the west. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

3:30 -
we just saw
5-6 fins and one partial body
pop out and back in from
Edmonds
. They are pretty far out heading south. -Priyanka Kulkarni
*

3:25 -
large group continues out from
north Edmonds
and look to be keeping southbound line. Occasional breaches as they steady on. I believe there is at least one male well in the lead further south that I had seen ahead of this large group.

2:50 -
hard to find them out here in choppy seas. From
Stamm Overlook, Edmonds
I've seen a lot of lunge feeding, breaches and/or tail lobbing behaviors
south of Cultus Bay
.

2:20 -
move south to
Haines Wharf, Edmonds
...just saw fins with CG boat due west mid channel
southbound
.

1:30 - 25 to 30
whales tightly grouped
heading south
at good pace on Whidbey side of channel
past Glendale
could be at Possession Point in 10 min or so. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
A truly memorable Thanksgiving day... Heeding the orca call (irresistible) of Southern Residents off Mukilteo, we headed for
Clinton arriving around noon
and were soon rewarded by the sight of dorsal fins and blows heading north
between Hat Island and Whidbey Island
. Suddenly the whales turned and milled before picking up the pace again towards the Clinton ferry dock. We watched
at least 12-15 orcas
pass by in two groups, thrilling waiting passengers at the ferry terminal and slowing down the ferry (perhaps the Tokitae). By
1:15 the whales were passing close to Glendale beach and having a good look around (lots of spy-hops) as they maintained a fast pace
towards Possession
. Four whales, including two mature males, turned and came close to shore as they circled prey with lots of tail slaps. We caught up with them again around

2:50 pm
as they cleared the green marker at
Possession
, followed by numerous (too many to count) full breaches and spectacular splashing. Although we didn't witness a lot of foraging, hopefully this high profile behavior indicates that they were finding plenty of energy bars. With strong winds and sea conditions worsening, we left our post at
3:15 pm still seeing huge splashes mid-channel in Possession Triangle, with the whales possibly heading south. -Sandra Pollard (author of Puget Sound Whales for Sale)
*

2:50 -
Looks much closer than mid-channel. I've seen some breaching
closer to Edmonds
shore but I'm looking from bluff above Golden Gardens with big binocs. -Jennifer Greiner Clark
*

12:32 - 10-15 north of Clinton
traveling southbound in a line while a few others forage a bit to the east.

12:28 -
have spotted
at least 3 orcas north of Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes
foraging mid channel

10:52 - At least 12-15 have passed Mukilteo
. Some nicely close in. Spread out across channel some
heading Northeast
some east towards Everett. Besutiful!. Very choppy.

10:10 -
I left Haines Wharf
Edmonds
where I could see
two groups 8-10 total
, foraging chasing salmon! still trending north!

9:30 -
from Sunset Ave in
Edmonds
we've seen
at least 5 adult males
with females and young streaming northbound
heading up Possession towards in general direction of Clinton/Mukilteo
. Some foraging behavior and tail lobs! We def have SRKWs!!! -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

Entry 2:
Southern Resident orcas (fish eating type) foray into Puget Sound foraging for salmon, socializing, bonding....engaging in their ancient cultural ways. Filmed from the shores of Edmonds & Mukilteo as I wander along the route of their journey on this gorgeous blustery day. Please don't visit marine parks, these intelligent family bonded orcas belong in their natural habitats...the open seas. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

1:53pm -
Just watched a group of
5+ orca
swimming south mid channel. Jumping and splashing. My location is
Mukilteo bluffs halfway in between Mukilteo lighthouse and Picnic Pt.
-Linda Shuger

They're just south of the
Clinton
ferry terminal now. Ferry had to divert its course to miss them. Spy hopping, fluke slapping, they seem to be happy! -Zachary Simonson-Bond

The photo above from the Orca Network facebook page was taken by a photographer this AM.. This was MY VIEW with my trusty binoculars- They were around the fishing pier and out
near the ferry lane
.. I then watched
a pod of over 15
swim north for almost 90 min until they went out of sight.. What a sight.. So grateful to see these beautiful creatures in the wild.. Can't wait to see more of them, kinda feels like a dream this morning.. Still in shock and a daze I think.. -Kristen Bogren

I'm happy to report that I sighted what appeared to be
Southern Residents at around
9:00 a.m.
today (about 10 minutes into the trip) on the
Edmonds to Kingston ferry
. Fortunately the Captain saw them and announced to the passengers that they were just off the port side. I was on the starboard side when it happened. When I got over to the port side it was hard to see through all the people gathered in front of the windows. The whales were spread-out not far from the ship, foraging near the surface in moderately choppy seas. I think there may have been at least 4 or 5 whales. -Davis Hyslop
*

9:00 -
foraging off
Edmonds
fishing pier, near ferry, north bound, mid channel east and west.

8:31 -

Kingston ferry

Saw multiple spouts from Amtrak just
south of Edmonds

There were three closer to the
Vashon
side but they were headed over towards
Point Defiance
side been about 15 minutes since I've seen him.

12:51 -
They were mid channel us Anthony's
Point Defiance
. -Meghan Davis-Van Horn
*

11:57 am - Orcas right off Pt Defiance
, heading north. Looks to be 3-4 of them, watching from Salmon Beach. -Dino Martini
*
1100 - at least 5 Orca spotted off Fox Island's Gibson Poin
t, in Tacoma Narrows. Looked like several individuals were feeding, or playing, as they moved Northward toward the Narrows Bridge. It was very exciting to see! Playing, or Feeding, while they were moving Eastward. -Roger Campanelli
*
I just spotted
two large orca
s in the bay that our house overlooks. Not sure of the exact type, but they were black with large white spots near their eyes, like the classic killer whale. Two seen together. Basically they were spotted coming from the north into the southern portion of
Carmel Bay, California
. Spotted them the second time directly north of the tip of the Point Lobos peninsula, they appeared to be heading west back out to sea, but I can't be certain of direction. Seen approximately
10:35am and

10:45am PST
. They weren't really doing much of anything, just gliding through the water and staying under for long durations. Not sure if there was a male, but they both seemed large. i.e. It probably wasn't a mom and calf unless it was nearly full grown. One of the whales had a very large portion of their upper fin torn off. Nearly half of it was gone. -Taylor Hartnett

1120 -
viewing
1-2 humpback or grey on west side of Orcas Island in President Channel
. Seemed to be headed north but milling around. -Alicia Toney
