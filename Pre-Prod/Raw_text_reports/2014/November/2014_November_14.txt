Orca Sightings for November 14, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Possession Sound:
Orca between Mukilteo and Clinton.
I'm a deckhand with WSF, working on Kitsap and Kittitas. From

2:30p until dark, there was a group of orca in the area between Mukilteo and Clinton
, staying generally south of the ferries routes. South of Clinton were a group of maybe 6 females and young ones? Close to the Mukilteo lighthouse were maybe 4 or 5 larger males. The captain informed Ops and the other ferry of their location and we stayed clear. Passengers were very excited, as was I! - Chris Stevens
*
Admiralty Inlet: We got tired of waiting for the whales to come to us, so got to
Bush Pt. at about
4:55 pm
and saw them just after they had passed, heading south! Ran back home, and at about

5:10 was pretty sure I saw and heard spouts in the near dark
, right at the north end of Mutiny Bay and on the Whidbey side, still heading south. - Susan Berta
*
Admiralty Inlet:

4:47
- Sandra Pollard called to report the orcas had passed
Bush Point
, still heading south, and she was pretty sure she saw
J27 Blackberry
.
*
Admiralty Inlet:

4:15 pm -
from Sandra Pollard - the last of the pod is passing
Lagoon Pt
and continue south, she has ID'd one of the trailers as
Blackberry from J pod
. Another 15+ orcas have headed south and should be near Bush Pt - we're looking for them!
*
Admiralty Inlet:

Group from Port Townsend should be
near Mutiny Bay
about now. Watched from Fort Flagler for about 45 min. Foraging with a few breaches. - Susan Marie Andersson
*
Possession Sound:

3:45 pm -
Danielle called to report seeing some
orcas from the Clinton-Mukilteo ferry
, the orcas were in between the ferry lanes and HEADING EAST toward Mukilteo. Sounds like they are continuing foraging in Possession Sound, possibly spread out since some were reported heading up the east side of Langley 20 minutes ago!

I'm seeing
two orcas heading north up the east side of Whidbey

More than a dozen members of J Pod
today, including
Blackberry (J27)
, foraging and porpoising near
Lagoon Point
, Whidbey Island, at

3:40 pm
. We watched several breaches and a couple of spy-hops, plus a continuous round of tail-slaps by one determined Southern Resident intent on finding dinner. The whales continued steadily south.

3:20 pm - passing Lagoon Pt
. where they slowed to do some splashing/porpoising and foraging, but are now on the move again headed south toward Bush Pt. - Sandra Pollard.

one big male
just turned around as soon as I posted that. He probably is following these posts on his iPod.
