Orca Sightings for January 15, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:09 am -
We have
orcas in the Sinclair Inlet
(an arm of Puget Sound in Kitsap County near Bremerton) again -- 2
between Manette and Manchester
, heading north/northeast. It was hard to see them this time because they were on the other side of the inlet, but I think this is the same pair I've seen before. It looks to me like a female and a baby. One dorsal is larger, both are curved on the back. When they're on this side of the inlet, they do a lot of diving because of the reef over here, there are a lot of big fish and sea lions, etc., on this side, and they all go there for the smaller fish around the reef. This time, they were just beneath the surface -- I think they may have been sleeping, because they weren't moving much. Usually after they stop by the reef, they move pretty quickly out of the inlet, toward the rest of the Sound; they don't hang around long. Today they stayed near the Manette side in the still water out of the shipping lane for at least half an hour in the same spot. Didn't get another chance to check before it got dark. - L Michelle Gardner

2:50 PM - 30 to 35 False Killer Whale pod
traveling west - watched a large pod, 30-35 individuals, of False Killer Whales slowly pass
Norwegian Point in Hansville
heading west at approximately
2:50pm. The whales were just traveling in a line and not feeding. Their lack of speed and location close to the south side of the strait made for a great sighting. Plenty of time to watch them and try to get an approximate count. They were traveling west in an approximate line with no apparent feeding nor any beaching. I waited a day to report the sighting because I was skeptical that the pod I saw could be False Killer Whales and finally decided that I should report what I had seen. I am a photographer and almost never am without a camera, but, when I went on a quick trip to the Post Office on the fifteenth I didn't grab one of them. I regretted it once I stopped at Norwegian Point just to see if anything was happening on the strait. So, no images are available. The whales were very close to shore, maybe four or five hundred feet out and I did have my binoculars. Given their size in relation to the loons out near them I estimated the larger individuals to be somewhere in the range of fifteen feet in length. My wife and I kayak and have been very close to Dall Porpoises, Grey Whales, Orcas, Humpback Whales and Common or Pacific Dolphins here in the Washington, around Vancouver Island and in Alaska. These whales were none of those species. They were black all over and had dorsal fins that were angled back with a rounded tip. The fins were not nearly as tall as those on an Orca nor as pointed as those on a Dall Porpoise. I never did see the snout area since they were not energetically surfacing while they traveled. They were purposefully and slowly heading west and the entire group would surface twice before going under for a short period of time and then resurface twice again. I saw this sequence about five times and the individuals didn't appear to change location within the group much. They were not in a clump, rather more linear with never more than three or so next to each other, thus my rough count. Again, I am skeptical of my identification, but, given the size, shape and color of the whales thought I had better report the sighting. It would be nice if someone else would see and report them. - David Keathley
