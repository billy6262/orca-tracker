Orca Sightings for January 30, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
These
orcas were spotted in the Gastineau channel of Juneau, AK
yesterday. They are resident orcas, correct? - Jennifer Quinto
*

5:13 pm -
Sighted the pod of
three orcas off President Point Road, Kingston
, yesterday afternoon. - Becky Yee Perry
*

5:19 -
they're way over
on the Kitsap side
and the light is failing. I've pretty much lost them
from Richmond Beach
in the low light.

5:16 -
All three back together, moved south at a faster pace, now approaching the pier at
Jefferson Beach Park
. Some thrashing water, with the big male pushing / chasing something (seal? sea lion?) up out of the water with his rostrum. This is in the same area I watched a transient male do this same sort of thing a month or two ago...

5:13 -
The big male disappeared, while the other two continued heading south. And now all three have gone stealth mode.
*
poof!
*
I'm
guessing these are transients
. Looks like they're working an area of water over and over again... perhaps chasing some prey.

4:47 -
I have them just west of mid-channel buoy, heading south,
between Kingston and President's Point
. One big male, one smaller female/kiddo, and possible sprouting male. They're well over towards the Kitsap side. Maybe Â½ mile out. Some short-term directional changes, but all three appear to be heading south again now. - Dave Haas
*

4:20 - 3 orcas -
large one, medium size, and little.
Ferry from Edmonds
had to swing wide. Closer to Kingston moving southwest. Couple, three miles from ferry dock. Erin Kallal Johnson

4:10 - Three spotted off the Edmonds-Kingston ferry
heading south. One seems little - Robbin Rae
