Orca Sightings for January 26, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:30 pm -
Carrie Newell called the Center for Whale Research to report seeing
a large number of Southern Resident orcas heading north off Depoe Bay, Oregon
. She took photos and will send those to the Center soon. These
may be members of K and L pods
, because J pod with L87 was recently off eastern Juan de Fuca Strait.

The transmitter worn by
L87 Onyx between
January 22 and
January 26 apparently fell off about 30 miles west of Neah Bay
.
