Orca Sightings for January 1, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Coastal orcas - I'm a commercial fisherman in
Northern California
and we recently video taped
a pod of Orca Whales attacking two Blue Whales
in shallow water and presumably a calf as well. If you would like footage of this please respond. The footage is not great and was filmed with a cell phone at a distance, but imagine you can zoom in and possibly identify some of the whales in the video. - Gary Ogle

a lovely group (10-12+?)
finally group up and meander by
Ft. Flagler
, in front of the ferry (it had to stop), and past Pt. Townsend...they were very slow, zig-zagging back and forth at the south end of Marrowstone....a few nice views of a big male right in front of beautiful Mt. Rainer....quite a few breaches, tail slaps, etc....very lovely, but a long day....saved from starving with a granola bar from Alisa Lemire Brooks...thanks!!! A big crowd of orca-holics there, and a few people who were having their very first encounter! Also heard there was a protest at the Rose Parade by the SeaWorld float....good!!!

It was an amazing afternoon watching
orcas from east side of marrowstone
and from fort flagler with lots of other watchers. we saw one spy-hop and a few breaches. I jumped up and down like a giddy boy when I saw the breaches! you may have heard me screaming and hollering all the way over at bush point. what a GLORIOUS treat to see them on this first day of 2014! - Shane Farnor

*
Ft Flagler

2:30 -
looks like they have finally all headed north of us. Very slow, leisurely travel with lots of foraging behavior. Hope they are getting lots to eat. There in my Binoculars were three black dorsals, and their blows. It was the most beautiful day, as I spent it watching them leisurely travel north, first from Point No Point, then all afternoon from Fort Flagler with friends on both side of the sound. I was once again reminded what a special place this is, and it's our responsibility to keep it that way. No one else is going to do it - WE have to do it. - Connie Bickerton

New Year's Day - what a start to the New Year!
J and K pods in Admiralty Inlet
ALL day, mostly well spread out, grouping up occasionally. With Howie Garrett on board, they kept us guessing as they headed slowly north, sometimes milling, sometimes turning back south, frequently zig-zagging across the glassy water of the shipping lanes. Passengers on board the Port Townsend ferry enjoyed a rare treat with spy-hops, breaches, cart-wheels, tail-slaps, a little logging and a spot of surfing. We heard some 'raspberry' blowing among surface chitter-chatter. Wishing our precious Southern Residents safe passage through the months ahead. - Sandra Pollard

Lagoon Point
