It was an eventful day today with our resident whales along the
west side of San Juan Island
. We were greeted by both members of
K Pod and L Pod
for our afternoon trip on the M/V Sea Lion. We first met up with these whales at Battleship Island and then followed them north towards
Turn Point Lighthouse on Stuart Island
. I always love being able to see them at Turn Point because Mt. Baker, the lighthouse, and the whales, will occasionally line up perfectly for the ultimate whale watching shot. - Naturalist Caitlin, San Juan Safaris and Outfitters

J2 "Granny" with J6 "Mike" (L87 "Onyx" and J42 "Echo"

in the background. - Tasli Shaw.

Here are a few of the
26 whales .. J2 "Granny", J40 "Suttles", J19 "Shachi", J27 "Blackberry", J38 "Cookie."

Between
2-3 pm - L pod sightings. Mega, Mystery, Calypso with Cousteau, Maisha with Joy and Ocean Sun
(according to Island Adventure crew) on the South-Western part of
San Juan Island
. Appeared to be feeding. I wished Lolita was with them. Hope that time is coming. - Zita Fekete

A mind-blowing closeup:
Tika K33 of the Southern Resident Killer Whales
surfaced so close to me at
Lime Kiln State Park
that I could scarcely fit him into my lens! This photo is uncropped. Tika (born 2001) is a teenager now, and his sprouting dorsal fin is taller than it appears here -- he was flexing his fin as he surfaced. - Meg McDonald, Wild Northwest Beauty Photography.

Today near
Point Roberts with J pod
.....predation events all over the place!!! First watching them taking down a chinook salmon and THEN
J36 and J41 spent over 45 minutes harassing a harbour porpoise. J42
joined in about halfway through the encounter also. So unbelievable to watch these residents throw around, carry around and slap the helpless porpoise. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

1:31pm - Whales on LK hydrophones
now!!!!!! Get out your listening ears, listen to Orca Sound! - Sherry Joyner
*
I was with
two group's of Bigg's Killer Whales
today. I'm not sure who this is, but look at the fresh wounds just ahead of the pec fin. I guess that happens occasionally when your food has pretty good sized teeth like a harbor seal! (
T65a's and the T36b's
). - Traci Walter.

Tonight Kim Neall Bruder and I (and Zoe) Jumped in the boat and headed out to
Patos Island
to photograph the Super moon against the light house and hopefully Mt. Baker depending on where it came up. We were hoping to catch all 3 together. As we arrived we noticed a boat to our left watching someone paddling a small boat along the rocks. I grabbed the binoculars and realized there was
a pod of about 6 Transient whales
swimming all around him. We headed over to watch. Not realizing this guy was in a small inflatable rowboat and surrounded by feeding Transients. Not my first choice of boats in that situation! As usual they did not have any concern with him but you can see from the pictures that he had to be a little nervous. Talk about a sitting duck! The Transients moved on from him and proceeded to circle the whole island searching every cove along the way for seals. We followed them around the whole island and ended right back where we started at the lighthouse just in time for the Moon. What an unexpected surprise. Anyway this is what we ended up with. it was a little tricky getting a good shot of the light house with the ripping currents. It sure was fun trying. Outside of the currents it was like a lake out there. Oh, what a night! - Karl Bruder
