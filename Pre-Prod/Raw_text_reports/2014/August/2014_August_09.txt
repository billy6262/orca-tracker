============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

I saw the

Lime Kiln
, a couple miles offshore. - Monika Wieland

We caught up with the
Resident orca near Vancouver BC
. They were headed back to the west towards the Canadian islands and we basically sat and let them stream by us. We saw
members of all 3 pods, mostly J's and K's
and they were going off. Breaches, cartwheels, spy hops, pec slaps, tail slaps and throws all around us. Several J pod whales made very close approaches. J27 Blackberry was at ultra close range today. Being that close to a wild, adult male orca is a breathtaking thing. He popped up right next to us then turned and passed no more than 3 feet from the stern under water. - James Gresham.

Yesterday's encounter with the
T065A's
- what an awesome family, they are indeed my favorite group of transients! They were hunting virtually all day, and although I know they need to hunt about 90% of their daylight hours, this still amazes me! The T065A's appeared to pick something up and pursue it through the open water. They chased what I think to be a pinniped of some sort of Sidney Island, where they made a successful kill. - Heather MacIntyre

Transient killer whales
T018s sighted today off Friday Harbor San Juan Island
Washington. - Natasha MacDonald.

T19B
swimming past some very nervous Harbor Seals. Scott from Deception Pass Tours picked up the
T18s at Salmon Bank
this morning. They spent most of the day cruising the shorelines of
San Juan Channel
harassing seals, and last we heard were up by
Stuart Island
this evening. - Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watch
