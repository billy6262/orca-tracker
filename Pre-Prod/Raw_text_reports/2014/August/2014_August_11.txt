============================================================

Entry 1:
There were
three humpback whales
heading very slowly north in
Haro Strait off Land Bank
from

12:30-
2:00
as well. - Monika Wieland
*
L85 with students on a field trip at Lime Kil
n. - Whitney Neugebauer.
*
Some days you have an encounter with whales that is stunning not for the breaches, spyhops and other exciting surface behaviors, but because you realize that you are the only boat watching
40 whales in Rosario Channel
...was so beautiful to watch the whales on the "orca treadmill", where they were swimming about 5 mph into a 5 mph current for over an hour... Thank you Ivan Reiff for yet another fantastic Monday on the Western Explorer. - John Boyd
*
Had an amazing day on the water yesterday, with maybe
40 Orca
around breathing and very active, we were around
San Juan island area
. - Stephen Ellwood.
*
Tika (K33)
kelping. Taken from shore at
Lime Kiln
. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu.
*
Awesome encounter just outside Mitchell Bay. - L41 Mega possibly showing off for the J pod females he was traveling with. - Kevin Culmback.
*
I thought the
Orcas
were going to come into
Snug Harbor Resort
and Marina and have a latte! Orca viewing from the dock! - Capt. Jim Maya.
*
Early in the morning J
-Pod (and a couple K-Pod whales
, I think)
came down Haro Strait and met up with the L12s
who had been hanging off the south end of San Juan Island the day before. I saw this mixed group with members of all three pods head north on the west side
between 1 and 2 PM
, with
L41 Mega's group
tight in shore with the
J22s
. I wondered where all the other residents had gotten to, as I believe everyone but the L54 sub-group has been "in" inland waters the last couple of days. Tonight I heard from John Boyd they had about 40 residents in Rosario Strait this afternoon, so that explains it! - Monika Wieland
*
I used to see more of the
L12 sub-group
than anybody else, but not this year! Today was only the second time I've seen them this season, but it was fantastic! I've got lots of photos to share, but had to start with this (uncropped) shot of the big guy: L41 Mega. Photo taken from shore on the west side of San Juan Island. - Monika Wieland.
*
A huge cartwheel from
L94 Calypso yesterday of Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island
. - Monika Wieland.

10pm -
Can't see them but can
hear them. Orcas
going past East to West,
Flint Beach, Lopez Island
. Gentle sounds of waves on the beach with blows from orcas, quite nice! - Sally Reeve
*

10:00am - orcas on lime kiln's hydrophone
. sounds like L pod. - Amanda Stabler Fitzgerald
*

9:35 am -
Not two but
three humpbacks
this morning
