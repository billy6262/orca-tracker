Orca Sightings for August 1, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
Lime Kiln J2, the J14s, J16s, J19s, L87, and K14s passed heading south between
2:40 and
3:30 PM
. While the K14s had been on the west side the day before, J2's group had spent a couple days up north coming down Boundary Pass and going right back up Swanson Channel. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

What was it I was saying about these two whales being my most photographed of the season? If
J37 Hy'Shqa and J49 T'ilem I'nges
want to keep popping up right in front of me, I'm happy to keep taking their picture! Off the rocks at
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. - Monika Wieland.

12:23 - Lots of orca in Boundary Pass
, 25 boats. - Jennifer Conkie

Reports of
transients off Waldron Island
came in in the late afternoon so Ken and Dave and I went out. We found them well north just about to enter the Strait of Georgia
between Patos Island and Saturna's East Point
. And what perfect timing this was: Instantly they put on a show of tail slapping and leaping repeatedly near the boat. I got a perfect double leap and lots of other leaps and flashy orca displays - in gorgeous light and high speed on the video in 4K! On top of this we put down a GoPro after a calf,
T037B1
, showed up in the propeller current right under us taking a jacuzzi. And sure enough it came right up to the camera several times - the first underwater shots from here. For all of us it had been a very memorable trip. - Florian Graner

watching from 5 mile drive. Whale is still
north of Narrows Bridge
, sort of heading south very slowly. Fishing boat just north of the one humpback. When it's quiet, you can hear it breathe from time to time. So, so happy! Taking 4-5 breaths and diving with a little fluke up on the dive. - Lila Pharis
