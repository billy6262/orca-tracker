Orca Sightings for August 26, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Good morning! Here's another shot from yesterday's encounter with
Bigg's killer whales
. This is a behavior we call a cartwheel. Upon closer inspection of the photo, it makes me wonder if this orca wasn't trying to launch one of the little common murres sitting on the surface into air. You can see there are a few small birds in the image and one in particular behind the splash of the whale's flukes. Just missed! Sometimes young transient orcas will play with birds, perhaps to hone their huntings skills. - Katie Jones.

We were out on a whale watch on Tuesday and spotted
8 to 12 Southern Residents off of Oyster Bay / Miracle Beach (north end of Georgia Strait
, about 15 miles south of Campbell River) on Vancouver Island, BC. I was just so excited to see Southern Residents up there. I do have photos of the saddle patches if you are interested. They were in the resting mode traveling south. After about 20 minutes, they were waking as I spotted barrel rolls, breaches, tail flops, spy hops and exposed bellies. It was amazing! - Jodi Mitchell-Ulriksen

right now. - Karlynn Elliott

Heading
west from Victoria, we caught up with the T18's
, a charismatic group of 4 transient orca, easily recognizable because of
T19B
. He's about 19 years old, and hasn't quite grown into his fin, to the point where it leans dramatically over to one side. Meanwhile in Vancouver, they were looking at different transients! They found a huge group consisting of at least 20 whales. Likely the T36A's, T37A's, T65A's, plus another unidentified group. In the afternoon the T18's were too far west to check out, and the big group of transients split in to more normal sized groups and headed our way. We caught up with them in San Juan Channel. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Mark Kudraz called to report seeing
at least 8 orcas at 9 am from the Pigeon Point Lighthouse in south San Mateo county, California
. They were several miles offshore, headed slowly south. A few of them looked like subadult males.
