Entry 1:
A short, sweet visit... Mystic Sea met up with
part of J pod, including Onyx (L87) and Granny (J2), near Tsawwassen ferry terminal, B.C. around
2:00 pm

The
humpback
I saw today didn't look like it had a destination to be at. I guess this makes sense since there were reports of a humpback a few miles away, but three hours later. It sure was a beautiful day in the Sound, that's where I'd be hanging. - Noah Izzard
*
I also saw
one humpback around
3:45pm
from the north side of the beach at
Fay Bainbridge
heading east. About 20 minutes later, I saw a blow straight across near Seattle. - Elizabeth Nicole
*

2:50 pm - humpback whale
spotted by my husband off beach near
Fay Bainbridge
, heading north. Was only 100 yards off shore, but moving out towards open water... Keep an eye out north kitsap. - Sue Surowiec Larkin
