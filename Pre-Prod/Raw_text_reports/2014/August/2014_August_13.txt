Orca calls were being heard on Lime Kiln Hydrophone
(and some echolocation clicks). Looks like
J Pod
made it to the west side of San Juan Island. I wonder where they'll head next! L Pod returned to the Salish Sea AND brought the L12's with them!! This is only the SECOND time I've seen the L12's this summer (which should concern you). All of the pods have been socializing together, and splitting up usual matriarcal groups. Some days it just seems like mom's are a little less protective, and anything goes. It's like an Orca soap-opera!! - Heather MacIntyre

J2 Granny with L87 Onyx
yesterday. It was funny to see them ROCKET by L41 Mega's group, who were lollygagging in the kelp, and cruise north, as Granny is wont to do. - Monika Wieland.
