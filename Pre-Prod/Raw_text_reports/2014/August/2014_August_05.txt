Orca Sightings for August 5, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw one male dorsal, then a female, about

8:50 mid channel, Saratoga Passage
, then they kind of disappeared! Off to find a good meal at the Penn Cove mussel rafts, no doubt! - Jill Hein
*
Four or more were headed across
Saratoga Passage toward Penn Cove at
8:30
. - Howard Garrett
*
8 pm -
Susan and now all of us saw about
3 or more orcas from Greenbank
. On the Camano side heading north. - Howard Garrett
*
7 pm -
Stephanie Raymond called from the Victoria Clipper heading up
Saratoga Passage and found about six Transient orcas off Lowell Point
, which is on Camano Island across Saratoga Passage from Greenbank. She said they are in two groups, one with 4 orcas on the Whidbey Island side, and another group with at least two on the Camano side, all trending northward.
*
I was sitting eating dinner and looking out over Saratoga Passage and noted the usual south bound Victoria Clipper just north of Langley. The boat stopped, reversed direction, and headed back north. I grabbed the binocs and went out on the neighbors bluff. I could see the blows from
approx. 6 orcas (transients?)
blowing and rolling on the surface. They looked like they were feeding, roughly
between Bell's Beach and Mabana
. The Clipper powered toward them, then slowed. They disappeared, to surface away from the boat. The boat zigzagged south to north several times, each time the orca disappeared for a short time, then again surfaced away from the boat and appeared to feed. They were moving very slowly to the north. The Clipper finally turned south to resume it's usual trip. - Barbara Brock
*

4:45 -
Danielle Doll called from the Mukilteo ferry after seeing
3 or 4 spouts about a half mile south of the ferry
. They were too far to see which way they were traveling. A humpback was seen there about the same time.
*
A report from Stacy Olson of
TWO PODS OF ORCAS
(one group of 3 and one group of 4) between
HAT/GEDNEY ISLAND and S. WHIDBEY ISLAND at
12:20 pm
, headed north!
*
From
Harborview Park area in Everett
, saw several spouts in that same area about

7:40 pm
. Too far out to confirm it's a
humpback
, but fun to see the sprays. - Anne Marie Hagel
*

7:40 -
Dick Snowberger saw the
humpback
from the
Clinton ferry
, north of the ferry landing.
*

7:20 -
Stephanie Raymond called again, this time with a report of a
humpback
! between the
Clinton ferry dock and Gedney Island
, moving slowly northward. That's two species in Saratoga Passage in 20 minutes.
*

5:33 -
There is
1 Humpback off Possession Pt
right now - Christopher Hanke

We popped over to a group of
3 humpbacks traveling down the Strait of Juan de Fuca
