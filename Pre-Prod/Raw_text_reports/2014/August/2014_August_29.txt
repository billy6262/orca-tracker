We had three trips with the
T137s and T37s
in some pretty choppy water! Whew ... here's to calm water! Transients aren't always flashy after they make a kill like most of my other pictures depict. Sometimes they just make a kill and keep going. Yesterday, we watched as three whales flew threw the air at the same time killing a harbor porpoise, then they seemed to eat on the go (prey sharing). These guys would make a kill then go back to business! - Heather MacIntyre

We found the
T90's, T124's
as well as a third unknown group off
Saturna Island
. The whales' behaviour was pretty typical to start, then all of a sudden they picked up speed and starting pursuing a harbour seal! And they got it! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

11:06 AM -
Sighting on western side of
Admiralty Inlet
. OMG!! First sighting on this side of Sound near
Port Ludlow
(near Hood Canal). It is raining so I had been looking through telescope at rock outcropping to see how Birds Cormorants and Seals and Gulls were dealing with rain when right near outcropping an Orca was swimming .. was so excited I forgot to look for identifying clues!!! I eventually lost him as he headed South. Since the particular outcropping I was watching is where seals are daily sunning/sleeping, so assumed they were searching for food. - Kathleen Raffo
