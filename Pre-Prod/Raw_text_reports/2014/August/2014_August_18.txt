Orca Sightings for August 18, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was at
Lime Kiln State Park around
6:30pm
when my son and I spotted
several orcas
and whale watching boats just off the shore at the overlook area. They were about 100 yards from shore and the whales were headed south around the island. - Wayne Wilhelm Greenfield

6:30pm - Hearing faint calls again on LK
....They been turning around all day once they reach Land Bank. Saw some pretty great behaviors this morn from the pullout but they haven't been needing to come north, been
spread out all down island
. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Such an amazing day on the water. First trip we had a
minke whale
, porpoises, eagles, sea lions, and then we ended up near
False Bay
with lots of whales everywhere including
J22, J34, K26
and more. And out of nowhere comes a
Pacific White-Sided Dolphin
that bow rode us for a bit! So I thought it would be hard to top that trip--so for the afternoon trip we had eagles, seals, sea lions, an very cooperative minke whale. Ivan and I decided to go out to see some Transient Orcas, and wouldn't you know it--we found about
12 more Resident Orcas
including
L84 Nyssa
that no one knew were out there. Then over to see the Transients (
T36s, 37s
) and right as we got there everyone else left!!! So just us and whales, who began to breach and cartwheel and play and gave us a very nice and pretty close pass. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watching

Just south of
False Bay, Ripple (K44)
with his family and others. I know I say it all the time but what a beautiful day with beautiful whales. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu.

The
K13s
hanging out with Ken Balcomb and the team from the Center for Whale Research.
SW side of San Juan Island, Whale Rocks, South End of Lopez Island
. We had
J's, K's and L's
. - Connie Bickerton.

7:40 - Faint Resident orca vocals
were heard on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
by Alisa Lemire Brooks. Visual by Ed, at least some of them coming in from the west towards island and to the south of Land Bank. They were milling spread out and trending south bound.
*
In the
afternoon
the residents that had been off
San Juan Island
began making their way steadily south, and by our
3:30 trip we had the rare opportunity to view
resident and transient killer whales within a mile or two of each other!
In a strange turn of events, the transients were playful and active, while the residents remained quite sedate, focusing on traveling. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watching

8:30am ... Two whales observed mid channel south of Kingston
and east of Pt Monroe at approx 47 43.8N 122 29.7W. The northbound Victoria Clipper stopped briefly to a show of blows and diving tails. The whales seemed to be leisurely feeding in the same vicinity for over an hour ... Repeatedly surfacing for a series of breaths followed by dives. The calm, sunny morning provided the chance to hear the blows from across the water. - Dan Hannafious with Isaiah and Doug

We saw the
humpback
again on the Clipper 3! He was circling mid channel near
Point Jefferson (Kingston) at
8:10
. - Justine Buckmaster, Victoria Clipper

12:10 pm - White sided dolphin off Edmonds!
