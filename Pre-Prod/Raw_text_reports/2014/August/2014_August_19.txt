Orca Sightings for August 19, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another amazing day on the water!!! Morning trip we were in
Boundary Pass/Swanson Channel
in flat calm waters with members of
K Pod, a few L Pod whales, and J Pod!!
Lots of socializing, and a few very nice spyhops by
J34 Doublestuff!
Then the afternoon trip we went south to
False Bay/Eagle Cove
area with
the rest of L Pod
. Lots of whales spread everywhere, and a few were even surfing wakes of big boats!! Nice close-up pass by
L95 Nigel
. Steller Sea Lions on Whale Rocks growling away. Very nice day and great passengers! - John Boyd
*
It was awesome to watch a
large group of whales heading south past Lime Kiln this afternoon
. They were a ways offshore but all in pretty close together. About half a dozen of them surfed a freighter wake - see two of them sharking while doing so in the photo here! Also, I coined a new term for all the mixing and matching of pods we've been seeing this summer: "hodge-pod". - Monika Wieland.

12:35 - Orca calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone
right now and for the past 30 minutes or so. - Jen Chesnut
*

2:30 PM - ~10 Orcas
heading south from
Lime Kiln
traveling with long moments of submersion (likely feeding). - Timothy Knab
*
Noon -
Jessica Wiltrout reports her husband was halibut fishing in 190' depth about
2 miles out from Goat Rock at Harris Beach State Park
, two miles north of
Brookings OR
, when a single orca came by heading north in rough seas.
*

9:45 am - Solitary humpack in central Puget Sound
, in the basin about a mile south of Richmond Beach in
Shoreline
. Spotted from inland with binoculars over a mile away so hard to clearly ID. Pronounced dorsal fin and tall blow suggest humpback. Heard what may have been a slap while it was on the surface. Seen surfacing 2-3 times in the same area then started heading north. - Dave Flotree

It's been lovely having
L and K Pod back in the Salish Sea
these past few days- and the vocalizations have been awesome! They've been doing lots of foraging along the west side of San Juan Island. Yesterday, there must have been over one hundred people at Lime Kiln Light to watch from land as
20+ L Pod
whales swam by. Check out these pics from two of my favorite boys who were foraging together yesterday. - Heather MacIntyre
