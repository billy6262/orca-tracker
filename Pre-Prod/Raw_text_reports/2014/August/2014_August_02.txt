- the same group that's been traveling together for the past three days now since they joined up off the Pender Bluffs Thursday evening. - Heather MacIntyre

J-Pod
is back in town! They put on a great show during the
afternoon
around
Race Rocks as they headed west

in the area, a mother and calf, relaxing east of Constance Bank, as well as
T37 and other transients off East Point
. Later in the afternoon we had some great evening sightings of K-Pod despite the chop. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
What an afternoon with the
T037
family!! These whales have been in the area for the past couple days and are obviously finding what resources they need in the waters in and around
San Juan, in particular, Boundary Pass
. We saw some of the BEST displays of social behavior ... breaching, spyhopping, tail slapping, cartwheeling, even racing through the water upside down! Today was one of those high pitched squeaky "Eeekkk" (!!!!!) days, for those of you who know me well. - Heather MacIntyre

Loads of tail-slaps and breaches from the
T037s
