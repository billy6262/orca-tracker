Orca Sightings for August 12, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Not only did we find
humpbacks, and not only did we find killer whales, we found them side-by-side!
And not only were they side-by-side, they were interacting! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Lindsay spied a
humpback
nearby. Captain Jeff got us in a great position for viewing while Tom and I started our humpback spiels. Rush found
another humpback
, and this one was
surrounded by killer whales
! We were initially frightened that they were transients (no one was prepared to see our well known
humpback friend Split Fin
, meet his demise at only 8 years old), but thankfully they
turned out to be residents
. They did harass Split Fin for a while and he let out several disturbed "trumpets" before proceeding to cartwheel and tail-slap continuously for 20 minutes. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

Meanwhile in
Howe Sound
(North of Vancouver) .... One for the memory bank.
18+ Bigg's killer whales!!
Including the
T124's new calf
, who I am unofficially saying is T124Ds calf (a first for her!). In attendance at various points in the day:
T34s, 36, 36Bs, 37, 37Bs, 90s, 99 + 99C, 101s + 102, 124s (minus 124C).

Vancouver near Bowen Island (Howe Sound)

New Biggs calf!! Looks like the mom is T124D

An amazing morning watching transient
Killer Whales attack a large Humpback Whale
right off Sooke...after the humpback tail lob, fin strike and trying to breach right on top of the Orca...they finally left him alone...
Also
K14's resident killer whales were visiting the Sooke area
....WOW! - Sooke Coastal Explorations

4 orcas
headed east to west in the distance, maybe a mile offshore of
Flint Beach on Lopez Island
