Entry 1:
Whales in Active Pass
7:50 pm. - Gary Cullen.

Seven year old
Echo, J42
leaps out of the air after reaching the
west side of San Juan Island
on Sunday. I love her personality, she's so spunky and curious! Definitely one of my favorite J Pod members, along with her brother (J26). - Photo by Heather MacIntyre.

It was another interesting mix of
part of J-Pod and part of K-Pod that headed up Swanson Channel
towards the Fraser River in the evening. In the mix was
J32 Rhapsody
, pictured here. The whales all stayed well north off the mouth of the river yesterday. - Monika Wieland.

A nice look at
K22 Sekiu
this evening while out with Legacy Charters up
in Swanson Channel
. - Monika Wieland.
*
DoubleStuf: J34
does a great cartwheel! (AKA tail throw, peduncle throw, or tail breach). Several lobtails and some sharking under a wake trail preceeded this exuberant display. Wonderful trip with Ivan Reiff and Katie Jones. With Carla Mitroff. (I took this cell phone photo of the image display on my camera; no computer on this Whale Safari!). - Alisa Schulman-Janiger.
*

3:25 pm - K pod came back in. Northbound with J. Henry Island to mid strait
.
6 yr old K42
Kelp with his MUCH bigger brother, 21 yr old,
K26 Lobo
. Today in
Haro Strait.
Severely backlit but these two guys are just too cool not to post. - James Gresham.
*
Woke up at about eight in the morning and heard the breathing of
orcas
as they headed south
past the south end of San Juan Island
. At twelve, I saw
Group A of J pod (plus the J22's) and all of K pod (minus the K21 crew?)
swim north past the house in a big resting line. But where was Group B of J pod? Soon after, I watched the same orcas from
Lime Kiln State Park
as they continued north. I was there for about an hour. At around four, I returned to Lime Kiln and saw
Group B (including the J16's and L87)
and
L pod (probably minus the L12's and L54's)
swim north. The orcas then all turned around and came back south. I believe Group A of J pod and K pod did not turn around but kept north for the Fraser River. I returned home a few minutes before seven. Saw around sixty one orcas today all together. - Melisa Pinnow

8:15 AM - 4 Orca
, 3 female 1 male orca, traveling south from
Lime Kiln
. - Aena Falcetti
*
Enveloped by fog atop Kanaka Bay I could see on the west side cam Haro Strait was free of it. And, I was sure I saw
an orca on that little camera
so off I went.

7:45am...Three, a bull and two females
(or female and young male) in the still of the morning foraging off West Side Preserve trending north. She came north past me and then the lighthouse, the male stayed mostly south, the 3rd came even with me at the south end of the park...then they all turned south. All filled up with morning bliss I had to leave to come pack up. I hope we see them again before we leave this beautiful island. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
About
1.5 miles off Point No Point
. My husband saw this
humpback whale
this morning while out fishing. - Karen Wagoner.
*
Had an islander post pictures of what by my eye looks to be
a pacific white sided dolphin
that was by their boat near
pt. Defiance
today. They only saw one and it stayed close to them for close to an hour. - Amy Carey.
