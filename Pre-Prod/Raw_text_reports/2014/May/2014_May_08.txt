Orca Sightings for May 8, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw another
orca pod
today. Sighting was at
38.40 (latitude, just south of Sonoma State Park, California
) less than a mile off the beach. Looked like another feeding event, tail slapping, birds, etc. Directly off of Black Point just below the Sonoma/Mendocino co line. They were very slowly heading south. - Erik

845AM - Pt Arena
Harbor Master relayed a call from urchin diver lots of killer whales active in close to shore at
38 40' N, (Sea Ranch area)
? No other details.
*
Jon (Scordino) got a call this morning at
~
8:45 reporting a large group of killer whales (at least 20) heading east past Neah Bay
. They reported seeing 3 or 4 males, so it is possible the group was larger. Jon actually was on the water shortly after that but did not run into them. - Adrianne Akmajian, Makah Fisheries Management

Killer whales spotted off Morro Bay,
Calif. It's a rare sight: Killer Whales passing near the shores of the Central Coast. It happened today in Morro Bay. "It looks like the Killer Whales might be either attacking or taking down one of the gray whales." said Becka Kelly, Harbor Patrol supervisor in Morro Bay. "Ive never seen this before in this area." she said. "We've seen Killer Whales come through, but I've never seen any live action like this." - Jeanette Trompeter

We had a pod, Minimum
7 possibly 9 or more 1 mile west of Morro Bay
. They killed a baby gray in the morning right off the harbor and we were on them later in the afternoon, breaches, tail displays, feeding.....going through pics now for IDS with Alisa and will send you more data and pics soon. - Hunter Kilpatrick
