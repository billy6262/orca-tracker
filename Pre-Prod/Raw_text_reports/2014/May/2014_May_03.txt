Orca Sightings for May 3, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Awesome day on the water with social Bigg's! The
T65As
in the
Gulf of Georgia
in flat calm conditions. This family of five is quite the joy to witness, they often appear boisterous at the surface (before, after, and especially during meal time). Today was no exception! They had made a sea lion kill earlier in the day and were carrying pieces of the carcass around, with the youngest,
T65A5
(first seen this March) making excited bursts of speed around his/her siblings as they pushed and dragged pieces of the sea lion around. Mom (
T65A
) was ever so cool and lead her family west at a slow and leisurely pace, allowing her 4 children to dawdle along and socialize with one another. - Tasli Shaw

Spotted
a single Orca on Saturday around
6:30 p.m.
in the bay by Ferry Road Park (near the North Bend "McCullough" Bridge") in
North Bend, Oregon
. Traveling, perhaps scouting, was by itself. He surfaced four or five times after I first spotted him and then headed out back under the bridge. I think it's about five miles or so from where I saw him to where he had to have come in at in Charleston. Pretty amazing. - Morgan Gaines

I saw a request from your network recently for pix of the
troughs made by the greys
. These were taken yesterday off our deck at
Whidbey Shores beach (at East Point, outside Holmes Harbor in Saratoga Passage, Whidbey Island).
Finally! We have really missed seeing our greys and sweet old Patch this year so far and were getting quite worried that they had deserted us. - Penny Thackeray

Onboard the Island Explorer 4, we found
a mom and a baby minke
! It was so exciting! In my eight years of working for Island Adventures, I haven't ever heard of someone seeing a mother-calf pairing in the area. We were at the south side of Hein Bank. - Brooke McKinley, Naturalist at Island Adventures Whale Watching

While on the Ocean Magic II this afternoon, this
Minke whale
traveling with a very small calf was seen at
Hein Bank, around 2.30pm
. We were 350-400 metres away so image is heavily cropped. The calf appeared to be very young. - Marie O'Shaughnessy, Orca-Magic.
