============================================================

Entry 1:
T100's T124's and T124a's, Nanaimo area
. Sweet afternoon! I received a tip of killer whales 3 hours into our tour. We extended the tour and got to see
12 Bigg's Killer Whales in False Narrows
this afternoon. We found them just north of Dodd's Narrows heading into False Pass where they hunted seals and socialized for 45 minutes. Another great day in the Salish Sea! - Simon Pidcock

8:21 - Whale
spotted earlier mile
north of Edmonds ferry terminal
turned and is slowly heading north.. Probably out from talbot by now.. Not too far off from shore (east side). Got some puff shots.

7:30pm -
Whale! Perfect timing! My wife (Jackie) spotted a "puff" out in the Sound while we were making dinner. Watched "him" playing around out from our place..(a dozen or more puffs) heading south one minute, then turned and slowly started north towards Mukilteo following the tide convergence.
