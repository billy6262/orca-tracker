Orca Sightings for May 15, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a bit of an exciting occurrence here in the islands - we encountered
three transient orcas
that have possibly not been seen in our neck of the woods before -
T139, T141 and her calf
. They were traveling with the
T18
group (which is frequently sighted here). T139 is estimated to have been born in 1978 and T141 in 1985. According to the "Transients" book by Ford and Ellis: "This group, encountered on only a few occasions in British Columbia, is very poorly known." Of course this book was written quite a number of year ago, but still enchanted to encounter some exotic transients. - Katie Jones

T139, T141
, and a small juvenile that was not T141A (maybe T141B-I'll check with Jared) that were with
T18 and the T19s today in Haro Strait and Boundary Pass
. This was their first visit to this area to my knowledge. - Dave Ellifrit

Today we had some new
Bigg's Killer Whales visit the Salish Sea
. We got to spend some time with them in
Haro Strait
. There were
seven animals
traveling together spread out over a few miles. One of the families were the
T018's
who we see fairly regularly in our waters. The other three whales traveling with the T018's were
T140, T141 and I believe T141B
. This is the first time I have seen these whales and apparently this is the first time they have been recorded in the Salish Sea. They tend to spend their time on the Central Coast. Beautiful morning on the water. - Simon Pidcock, Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay

1:47 pm - T097 and T093 off Constance Bank
. I got the report of them off Constance Bank traveling NE towards Trial Island off Victoria BC. - Josh McInnes

Bret Greenheck of
Yaquina Head Park, Oregon
, reported seeing
two adult male orcas around 5 pm
approx. .5 mile from shore off the headland, milling around Seal Rock for several minutes, then heading west around the headlands. He went to a higher viewpoint to try to find their direction of travel but could not re-locate them.

Stan Crupen - sport fisherman, called to say he saw
about 6 orcas, including two adult males
, in water 350' deep just off
Bodega Bay CA
.
