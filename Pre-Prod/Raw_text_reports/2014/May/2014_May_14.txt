3-4 females and one large male

Alisa Shulman-Janiger has ID'd the male as CA94, Transient-type mammal-eater, never associated with other known transients. This is only his THIRD sighting! The first was in 1990 - off of Santa Catalina Island.
This is an amazing sighting of a very distinctive male! He was with two very distinctive females (as well as several juveniles) during his previous two sightings. I did not see those females in any of the images that JC sent to me. One female suffered some sort of injury between 1990 and 2008, and lost over half of her dorsal fin! - Alisa Shulman-Janiger
