Orca Sightings for May 9, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
A few of us got to see
Jpod go through Spieden Channel
heading NW a
t
8:30 p.m
. They were moving steady and pretty fast, a bit spread out. There are a few photos but I haven't gotten permission yet to post. Granny was in the lead with Onyx, I am pretty sure. - Peggy Mauro

Calls just started at
9:19 on Orcasound
! :) - Meg McDonald

I received a call from a buddy on the ferry that he saw
killer whales entering Active Pass at 1145
. Mike on Sealion was able to locate them and confirmed
Jpod spread out offshore Mayne Island heading south east towards East Point
. With the power outage on San Juan Island between
12:00 am and
7:00 am they were able to make their way north up Haro and Swanson Straits in the early morning without being detected on the S.J.I. hydrophones. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
*

6:22 - J pod heading south in Boundary Pass
, approaching Turn Point.

3:30 - Ken Balcomb reports
J pod is in southern Georgia Strait
, heading south, spread out and hopefully finding some scattered Chinook heading for the Fraser River.
As noted in the previous Orca Network Sightings Report, J26 Mike (presumably with the rest of J pod) was photographed off the Russian River, about 50 miles north of San Francisco, at 1130 on
May 1. As noted by Meg McDonald,
J pod traveled over 850 miles in 8 or fewer days
to get from Bodega Bay (Russian River) on
May 1 to the San Juan Island area today, where they were reported at 6 am this morning. That doesn't give them much time to eat or rest.

We spotted
Granny, the oldest killer whale known to science
, with an estimated birth year of 1911, and matriarch of J-pod. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching
