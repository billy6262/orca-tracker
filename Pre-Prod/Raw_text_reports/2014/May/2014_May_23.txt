Orca Sightings for May 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Wow what a day! Great encounter with Bigg's Killer Whales. After we got on scene with the whales a second family of Orcas showed up.
Between Nanaimo and Parksville with the T086A's and some of the T124's and T124A's.

I just love seeing this whale,
T124A1
. She's a good reminder of how mysterious these animals are. She's often seen separated from her matriline and swimming with other groups. It is pretty rare for them to be swimming with no family members. We saw her a few weeks ago swimming with her mom and siblings and now she's off on her own again swimming today with the
86A's
......such an awesome whale! - Gary Sutton
