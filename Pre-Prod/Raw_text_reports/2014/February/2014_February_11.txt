Orca Sightings for February 11, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:45 -
Real time report from Tom Argyle from a boat
1.5 off the coast just south of Brookings OR
, where
8-10 orcas are breaching and splashing around
. No photos.
*
Humpback or Gray East of Port Angeles.
While putting away the laundry a humpback or a gray whale breached approx.
1/2 mile west of Green Point and 1/4 mile offshore
. The single whale then continued traveling west towards Port Angeles Harbor. - Tony Little

10:30AM
. I am watching
a whale progressing northbound in Saratoga Pass
, in the center of the St, about in a line
between Cama Beach on Camano and Greenbank/Hidden Beach on Whidbey
. It is spouting about every 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 minutes. All that I can tell in the scope is that it is not an Orca. No visible tall fin. Last week we had a Grey pass by very near the shore. It was inside our mooring bouys. - Dick Schlueter
