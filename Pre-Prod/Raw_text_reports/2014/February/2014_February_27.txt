Orca Sightings for February 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:45 - last seen from Pt No Pt headed north/northwest
on the west side of Whidbey. North and west of the yellow bouy and shipping lanes.
Mutiny Bay or north
of that. - Lila Pharis
*
Far from us on the
Mukilteo Beach at
11:30
but zoomed in all I could see was
two dorsal fins
. - Heather Lopaschuk
*

1:27 -
In the shipping lanes
about a mile south of Pt No Pt
, still no definitive direction

1:10 -
They're still there. Acting like T's.

1:03 -
I'm at Shipwreck just north of Picnic Point. Whales are still just
south of Skatchet Head buoy
. Ever so slowly moving west and maybe south.

12:40 -
Whales are milling around halfway
between the Possession & Skatchet buoys
, no boats with them. - Rob Miller
*

12:35 -
The whales just hightailed it
around the point headed southwest
. There is a black coast guard boat to the east of them. The whale watching boat just left. 1

2:25 -
There are
two males, two young and at least 2-3 females
. They are inside the mooring buoys
off Possession beach
only about 20 yards offshore. There was a baby with the group that looked very young so not residents I'm guessing since they didn't have any babies this year.

12:13 -
They are off
Possession beach
right now. They were traveling south quickly but now are milling about-lots of tail slaps and breaches. They are very close to the whidbey side. - Nicole Woltersdorf
*

12:12 -
Just passed
5-6 orcas
heading south along the
east side of Whidbey near Possession Point
. Group included at least one male and two smaller individuals. - Andrea Hennings
*

12:03 - Possession bay
headed toward Possession point, tail slapping spy hops lots of activity.

11:54 -
Eyes on fins still south of ferry 3 miles... Looks like a couple males... Look to be heading southbound but to far to tell. - Tyrone Reed
*

11:15 -
Spotted mid-channel
west of the Clinton-Mukilteo ferry
moving toward Whidbey shore. Est.
6-10
, including two larger dorsal fins (males) and possibly 1-2 young. They put on quite a show for those of us on the ferry! - Linda Ade Ridder
*

10:31 -
Some people spotted as many as 10. There was definitely a male with them after my first report. Last seen
headed toward Everett
.

9:30 -
Two more suddenly appeared alongside the three already seen, so
now there are five total
, and one is an adult male. Still heading north, a little
closer to the Clinton side
.

9:05 -
Dave Davenport in
Mukilteo
is watching about 4 orcas in mid-channel between the Mukilteo ferry landing and Whidbey Island, heading north into Saratoga Passage. It seems to be a mother and baby and two others, but no males.
*

3:43--
4:02
.......At the
Vista Point at Irish Beach, Manchester, California
, about
5 miles north of Point Arena
. Three orcas, one
a male
. Approximately a mile and a half NW from us and a mile out, and angling off slowly at a heading of 311 degrees from us. Just an observation....The direction they were moving would put them behind two northbound gray whales. - Scott Mercer
