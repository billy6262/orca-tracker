Orca Sightings for February 10, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I began hearing
SRKW calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones at
4:24pm
. The calls were very faint, increased slightly in volume, and then faded off again. Total time was apx 45 minutes. I did not hear any calls on the Orca Sound hydrophones during that time. - Jeanne Hyde, Whale of A Purpose blog
