Just now (

Seattle to Bainbridge they saw orca(s)
. No idea on how many or direction. Anyone else hear/see anything? - Lynn Batson

Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries, relayed a report from the Ferry Tacoma of
two orcas headed south near Tyee
(just off Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island) this evening.
*

5:05 pm -
Wednesday.
At least 3 Orcas
surfaced on the north side of the ferry just outside of
Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island
. They were right next to the boat when I saw them but it appears they were headed south. - Tim Cuddy

At least
1 orca seen heading south from the
4:40 BI ferry from Seattle

A friend in Gig Harbor says her babysitters (who certainly weren't out looking for whales) saw
a humpback
