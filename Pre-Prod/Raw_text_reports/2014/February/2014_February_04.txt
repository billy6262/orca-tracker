Orca Sightings for February 4, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network got a call from Don Taylor from his boat out
13.5 miles from the beach about 9 miles north the CA border, where he saw 4 or 5 orcas
. No direction of travel. Sea lions were nearby but didn't seem to be bothered. No photos.
