Orca Sightings for June 22, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on the delayed

7:25pm
WSF Kaleetan
to Orcas Island
. The whales were headed SSE at a pretty good clip. They were forward and a bit to Port of the vessel when first sighted. - Cindy Wolf
*
Up and down San Juan Island, all day long in tight, affectionate groups, and their emphatic puffs of watery exhales accompanied me as I worked. All day long, back and forth. - Alex Shapiro
*
The second day of summer brought calm seas and sunshine along with members of
J pod into Bellingham Channel at
11:30 am
. The whales looked relaxed, a hint of flirtation here, a little play there, a couple of spy-hops to check out the scene and some tail slaps for good measure. Later they turned and greeted us again with Blackberry (J27) trailing kelp, after we circled Cypress Island. A memorable and peaceful encounter for all to appreciate and enjoy. - Sandra Pollard (SSAMN) - Mystic Sea.

This morning the part of
L-Pod that's here (the L26s, L43s, L4s, L47s)
went north on the west side of San Juan Island, then they came back by
Lime Kiln and Land Bank
heading south at
about 2 PM
. - Monika Wieland

On the west side of Sinclair

Same group.

*
We had
two humpbacks very close to shore, around
7:00 PM going south to American Camp
. not sure of exact time. My rock is between eagle point and false bay on san juan island. - Jenny
*
I am on
False Bay Rd
... I can't see the water, but can hear them when it is quiet. At

5:30 pm
tonight... in
between Eagle Pt. and Mar Vista
I'd guess... the loudest blow ever!! - Cher Renke
*

5:45 pm -
I suddenly jumped at the other-worldly sound of the deepest, loudest exhale I'd ever heard. Looking up, there it was: my first
Humpback whale visitor
, in all the years I've lived on this point. The whale submerged and swam further away from shore, and I did not see it again. I gasped as I saw the huge body lumber past me, powerful, graceful, and just 50 yards from my feet. A memorable moment, and of course, photos don't do it justice! - Alex Shapiro
