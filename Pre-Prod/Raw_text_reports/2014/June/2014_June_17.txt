Orca Sightings for June 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod spent the last 3 plus daylight hours off the west side of San Juan Island
, engaged in a lovely variety of behaviors going against the tide and in the massive churning rip-current just south of the West Side Preserve/Land Bank off what I think is Edwards Point. Totally cool to watch them expend that kind energy and engaging in such forceful currents for such a long time...many breaches. etc.
We left them at
9:20
, they had not yet committed to a direction. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

One orca in Discovery Bay
(5 miles west of Port Townsend). It seemed to be resting on the waters surface for over a minute. I could also see an aircraft carrier traveling south east through the strait (towards Everett? ) We were wondering if it came into our bay to get away from the carriers noise? It was between my house and Protection Island. After a minute or so, it swam down the bay a bit, dove a little, and exited the bay so close to the cape George shore that I could hear occasional blowing, but not see it. It was a terrific experience, but concerned for its safety/health. - Sharon Mitchel

L pod sighted off Tofino!
As I am typing (

10:18 pm
) a group of
10-12 killer whales with open saddles
are heading up the coast. The last report was 2.5 miles off sea lion rocks (long beach area). Rod wanted me to send a note. I am sure we will have a more detailed route and photos by the end of the day. Here are a couple of ID shots. The pod was spread out in a long line ranging from off Cleland island to off Tree island when I was out, and the skippers have reported that they are still spread out quite a ways and not moving very much at all. I am guessing there is between 15 and 20 in total. They look like southern residents because of that open saddle on the bull. - Gwen, Strawberry Isle Research on N. Vancouver Island
PS: estimates range to as many as 30 animals...Rod
