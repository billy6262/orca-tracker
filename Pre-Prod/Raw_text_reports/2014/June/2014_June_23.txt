Orca Sightings for June 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
On our way off island,we meandered to County park at

11:40
and caught glimpses of the
SRKW tail-enders and left at
12:18
with leaders at
Open Bay
(north end of San Juan Island). - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Daylight is dimming and we still don't have a positive visual contact of the humpbacks from south of Bush Point. Hard to imagine they got by us, but about
9:05 we thought we heard two blows already north of us behind the bluff and out of sight, still heading north from the sounds. - Howard Garrett
*

8:06pm - Two humpbacks just passed point no point
. They gave a great show with tail slaps and jumping out of the water. They're headed north. - Mary Bright
*

7:15 PM - Humpback Whale Admiralty Inlet
. Watched what appeared to be a
humpback whale breaching off Point No Point in the middle of Admiralty
. Breathtaking sight. It was headed northwest up Admiralty. We were at our beach house at Point No Point watching. Tail flukes smashing the water, breaching, just spouting as he/she traveled up the channel. It started closer to the Kitsap side but seemed to move closer to Whidbey as it swam away from us. - Sean Hatt

About

3:30 pm
was driving my 24 foot sailboat south from Oak Harbor to Seattle -
just off the Edmonds Marina I saw a whale
just about 50 yards off my starboard side -
about 40 feet long
(?). Did several shallow dives (3-4 times) - blew (breathed) several times - saw its tail but do not remember seeing the dorsal fin. Just one whale. Wasn't certain it was an Orca - seemed grey more than black & white. Had a bump on its head. - Kenneth Johnson
*
I didn't see it for myself, but I was talking with a locksmith at our house in Richmond Beach around

11:00am
. He was looking out the window towards the water as we were chatting and claims he saw a
"big" whale surface
. I scanned for 5+ minutes afterwards but never saw anything. Wonder if this was the same animal spotted up north earlier today? - Dave Haas

0845 - one humpback
at 48deg 09'N x 122deg 41'W,
about 200 yards off Fort Casey, Admiralty Head
, Whidbey Island, traveling south. Observed it sounding three times, then deep dive (flukes clearly in air). - Andy Reay-ellers, r/v JACK ROBERTSON, UofW, Applied Physics Lab
