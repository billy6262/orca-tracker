============================================================

Entry 1:

A really wonderful encounter with the
T124As
. Very social, and just about the most adorable calves I have ever watched.
T124A5 and T124A2A
, both almost the same age, were SUPER playful with each other. It looks like they were having a tail slapping competition at one point, as they furiously slapped their floppy flukes on the water in tandem. They were like little pieces of popcorn bouncing around and breaching out of the water, doing child-like back breaches that would turn into wiggly fluke kicks in the air, cartwheels over top of each other, side twists ... just being hyper kids! Their playful energy seemed to rub off on older sibling T124A4 who joined them in the breach fest. It has been a privilege to encounter so many Bigg's killer whales this season so far. I can't imagine the number of times we must bomb past these guys on our way to see the resident whales. The photos do not do it justice, but it does give you an idea of how much they were breaching! - Tasli Shaw
