Orca Sightings for June 10, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amazing and quiet evening on the water last night. We were the only boat out there for almost all of our trip, it was so peaceful. We shared the evening with the
J16s, T086A's, and the T137's
. For me, there is just something about killer whales, a profound evidence of culture and compassion, something that's beyond my ability to scientifically quantify... So I just enjoy it. With Legacy Charters. - Heather MacIntyre

2:30pm - J-pod
(at least a part of them) were northbound past
Turn Point. J19 and J41
were closer to shore while the
J14s
were further off. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Feels like I have barely seen Residents this year! It's been all about the T's so far. Got to spend a nice day today with the
J22's and J32
, though. They were just slowly cruising along and J32 was being her playful self. Here is a shot of some of her showboating! - Gary Sutton

More
T65As
love! Got out with these guys tonight and witnessed one of the most amazing predation events in my 10 years of doing this. The photos don't do it justice, but notice the harbor porpoise lodged in the whale's mouth in the 2 close up shots. - Ivan Reiff

Beautiful day out on the water! Out with both transient and resident orca. Both were less than 400m from each other! Jpod and the
T065As
north at
Pender Island
. Wasn't a fan of how large vessels move through the area and around whales. T065A and T065A5 with large vessel in the background. - Josh McInnes

Killer whales in
Plumper Sound
! My first time seeing them in there. And who else but the
T65As
, our "resident transients". We watched what appeared to be a classroom situation, with a very unlucky harbour seal being the lesson. Mom and baby sat off to the side while the other three kids took multiple passes at the seal. Many powerful lunges and even a sideways karate chop. The finishing blow sent the harbour seal flying in the air. Lesson over, time for recess. - Tasli Shaw

Well our "resident Biggs",
T65A's
, were kicking ass again today!! Only the second time I've seen whales in
Plumper Sound
and they were just hammering a seal! Amazing to see the power these animals can display and really cool to see T65A cruising in circles with T65A5 around the other whales hunting the seal. A live demonstration of how it is done! Got spoiled with getting to see the
T137's
on the way home too in Boundary Pass. They were the polar opposite of the T65A's.....being super mellow in a beautiful resting line. They were only swimming hard enough to not be pushed up by the flood and were not moving anywhere. Gorgeous day out there. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
