Orca Sightings for June 24, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
Js and Ls
did the unexpected today! They came down
President's Channel
instead of
Rosario or Boundary
, and looked like they were going to continue down
San Juan Channel
. Then they did a U-Turn, and came close to shore at
Reuben Tarte County Park
(NE San Juan Island, near Roche Harbor) at 1 PM, then went west through Spieden Channel. When they reached Haro Strait they fanned out and slowly made their way south against the strong flood tide, with some whales close to shore and others out in the middle of the strait. It took them from about
2:30 to
5:00 PM to fully pass by Lime Kiln Lighthouse! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

I. AM. EXHAUSTED. After striking out with orcas early this morning, ended up with an EPIC (there's that darn word again) encounter from shore at
Rueben Tarte. J's and L's
came right by the rocks and were literally at our feet. Most of these photos are not cropped - that's how close they were! What a fun place to see them. A first for me! And then caught them again on the west side as they headed south against a big flood. - Katie Jones

Today the
J Pod and (part of) L Pod
took an interesting route through the
San Juan Islands
. They came down into
President Channel
, milled around across the top of San Juan Channel, some made it to Yellow Island, then everyone turned back north socializing and breaching all the way back north. They actually tucked in behind O'Neil Island and some orcas went on both sides. I've never seen Resident orcas in this area. What a fun experience. Very happy whales with lots of adult play time in between! - Traci Walter

It's been so great to have the
J's and L's
around for multiple days now! So many incredible encounters with them. Yesterday was no exception....J's and L's moving
north up Swanson channel
along the Pender bluffs. Two big resting groups,
J's in the lead and L's trailing
. Here is a pic of some of the L's in their resting pattern. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
