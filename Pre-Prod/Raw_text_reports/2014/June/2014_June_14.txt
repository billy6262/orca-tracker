Orca Sightings for June 14, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another beauty out there! We had the
T124A's near Zero rock
heading north today. This is such a fun group with the two youngsters,
T124A5 and T124A2A
always playing around. We got surprised by T124A3 who popped up close to us at one point and it has a pretty cool saddle patch (like a type B antarctic killer whale, almost extending to the eye patch). - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
Two females heading ESE. In comparing one whale's marking it appears to have been two from the
T49B
. The coordinates were: 49 degrees 45" 37N by 124 degrees 56' 54W. That is right by
Seal Bay Provincial Park, Vancouver Island
, British Columbia. - Janet Russell
*
It appears we may have
a new Humpback
. This whale seen Saturday in
San Juan Channel
is not in the catalog. - James Gresham
