Orca Sightings for June 28, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Yesterday we were out with the Residents, some of
Jpod and some of Lpod
, towards the
southern end of San Juan Island
. Boy did we see some interesting things. We saw
J35 and J47 'playing' with a harbour porpoise!
We also saw foraging and breaching. We had L118 surprise us with three breaches in a row and L95 seeming to come out of nowhere, coming to check us out. Great day out on the water! - Ashley Keegan, Wild Whales Vancouver

Incredible day Very curious group of whales. Today was amazing too with more action from
J's and L's off the west side near False Bay
. Tons of foraging and goofing around. I've attached two pictures of L118 "Jade" breaching. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Thought you might like to see these pictures of a
2 Humpback Whales
, Big Mama & her Calf, we encountered off Victoria (
south of Race Rocks
) yesterday morning! There was actually
9 Humpback Whales reported in the area
(including "Split Fin" right off Albert Head) as well as
Transient Orcas (TO75 & TO75A near Becher Bay)
plus
Resident Orcas were first picked up south of Trial Island heading east
. We do not usually get this amount of Humpback Whales in our local waters until much later in the season, so this is very exciting. - Andrew Lees, Five Star Whale Watching
