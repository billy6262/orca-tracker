============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca sighting now in front of
razor point Pender island
.
3 orcas
playing. 6 boats. In 9 years never seen them here. - Shirley Wilson

Members of the
T65A's
off of
Point Doughty
, Orcas Island. It was a gorgeous evening trip aboard the Western Explorer and we were with the T65A's for almost an hour. - Chris Teren
*
Wonderful day with the whales! First of all transients (
T65's
) in
Peavine Pass at around
1:00 pm
, then later a surprise greeting from
J pod
on our return to
Anacortes
, including Onyx and (probably) Granny - right in the glare zone - well spread out and traveling at speed. - Sandra Pollard (SSAMN)
*
Great day whale watching!
J pod members we saw and were able to ID were J22 Cookie and J34 Doublestuf
. Saw some common porpoises. Then
a group of transient orcas with a newborn calf
only a few months old, 4 members total! Watched this group hunt and kill 2 separate seals! Then
we saw a humpback whale
! And we finished the trip off with J pod, several orcas breached and jumped into the air, and a big male named Doublestuf went under our boat, came up very close, and spy hopped (stuck his whole head out of the water). - Amber Prewitt

Noon - J Pod past Jordan River headed West
, goodbye for now. - Heather MacIntyre (
Or maybe they turned around - see above post by Amber Prewitt
)
*
Had a pretty special encounter with the
T65As this evening in Presidents Channel
while out with Western Prince Whale Watching & Wildlife Tours - this group of transient orcas has been more or less "resident" this spring, spending much of the last few months here. The five whales (a mother and her four living offspring) are quickly becoming local favorites! - Monika Weiland
