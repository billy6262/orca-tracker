Orca Sightings for December 24, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
What an amazing day spent with
J pod
!!! Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, and I found them headed through
Pole Pass
(a 200 ft. wide gap between Crane Island and Orcas Island) of all places. They eventually made their way into
San Juan Channel, then Spieden Channel
, and on toward Stuart Island. The orcas were in a very active mood, with TONS of spy hops (mostly from
J17
), tail slaps, pec slaps, and general goofing off.
Everyone was accounted for except for the J16's
. The water condition, sunny weather, and company couldn't have been more perfect too! Still totally pumped from the encounter! -Melisa Pinnow

Pretty sure we saw the same animals from
Pender Island bluffs at
10:30 am
where they appeared to be feeding, I think we counted up to
4 orcas in Swanson Channel
. We watched them from approximately

10:15 am -
10:45 am
, then again at
11:30 am from the ferry dock, when they were traveling in the direction of Active Pass. -Maria Chantelle

Whales from ferry. Heading west from
north end of Upright Channel towards Orcas Landing. 2-3 small groups
spread across channel. Lots of surface activity. -Doug McCutchen

Graham Dewitt on the ferry Elwha called at

9:15 to report 6-12 orcas in Upright Channel, between Lopez and Shaw Islands
, heading west into Harney Channel, between Shaw and Orcas Islands.

3:54pm -
Just saw a pod of
3-4 heading north off of Saratoga Passage near Greenbank
. Stunning. You could hear their breath as they surfaced just off of our deck. So awesome!! -Marie Gill

2 possibly 3 adults and one baby, one very large back fin, spotted at Hidden Beach in the Saratoga Passage.

My cousin in Canada just texted me they saw
2 orcas
from the BC ferry between
Pender and Saltspring Island
. No idea if they were residents or transients. -Jeanette Dorner

a pod (sorry, don't know how to identify!) at about

Blower's bluff
and out to the strait. Gorgeous! -Trace Farrell
