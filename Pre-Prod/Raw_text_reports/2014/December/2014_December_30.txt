4:55pm - Single male orca at Prevost Island
. On the ferry from
Swartz Bay to Mayne Island
, spotted a single (I think, never saw more than one at a time) male orca just south east of Prevost Island (Canadian Gulf Islands) between the ferry and the island. It looked small to me, but I wouldn't know as this was my first sighting ever! Definitely a male though, based on the very tall dorsal fin. Thanks so much for this website! Recent sightings in the area are what kept me motivated to stay out on the cold deck so long! He came up maybe 10 times and disappeared just as I pulled out my camera and just as my wife joined me! -Jeff Turner
Note: The orca in this sighting was not identified.

My name is Wayne Barnes & am a wildlife photographer in
Tofino
. I came across a small pod o
f 4 Orcas
. It appeared to be 3 adult females with two calves.
Dave Ellifrit and Josh McInnes confirmed the ID on these orcas as Transient orcas
T68C's, T68C, C1 and C3
.

Bob Lyden just posted: I just received a call from Joe in Thompson Cove (
south end of Anderson Island
) that there were about
Five (5) Orcas
in the Cove probably looking for sea lions
between
9:00 AM and
10:30 AM
this morning and they left when some boats arrived. Joe said there was also approx. (4) Sea Lions hugging the shoreline at the same time, and he sees one out there now at
2:00 PM on this afternoon. so this probably is the same pod that has been around Anderson Island for the last seven (7) weeks. -Kelly Burns Keenan

Not sure of pod identification, but seeing
3 or 4 orcas heading north through Tacoma Narrows
. -Steve Finney
