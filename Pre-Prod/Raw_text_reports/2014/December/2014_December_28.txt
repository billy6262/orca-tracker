They continued south slowly down the shore, tail slapping buoys as they went by. I spent an hour watching these
orcas
pass very close to shore, a pod I have never seen before. It took me 3 hours to finally catch up to them, and just as I was about to head home and give up, this happened. It was a truly amazing day. -Rachel Haight

Taken at
Possession Point Park
, south tip of Whidbey Island. These are the
T137s
, thanks to Josh McInnes for the ID. One was tail slapping a buoy. -Rachel Haight
*
Video by - Since mid-late November the
T137s
(mammal eaters) have been documented nearly everyday somewhere in the inland waters of Puget Sound, primarily roaming the inlets deep in the south Sound. Today came word of orcas
southbound in Saratoga Passage
in the north Sound. From the bluffs above Mukilteo Lighthouse park we spotted their blows as they neared the
Clinton Ferry terminal on Whidbey Island
. This video follows them southbound in Possession Sound until they reach Possession Point where they regrouped became very surface active, as if on a kill. Across on shore was a friend who was gifted with a very close up encounter. The pods approached within 100 feet of shore and she photographed one as it engaged in tail-lobbing a buoy. She was able to get IDable photos of at least one matriline, the others were not ID'd at this time. We followed the pod(s) southbound and ended in Shoreline watching the orcas pass the Kingston ferry terminal minutes before the sun nestled down for the night behind the Olympic Mountains. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Alleged small group of

Killer whale south bound southwest of Race Rocks
. I spotted a few killer whales (looked like transients) in less than ideal conditions near Race Rocks. Before I could confirm who they were they surfed off to the south and disappeared into the 6 foot seas. -Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
*
Walking with some friends at the Heron Rocks campground (in
western Georgia Strait, between Nanaimo and Campbell River
), with hundreds of Stellers + California sealions on the rocks and in the water, off TOBY Island, there was a
SINGLE, YOUNG ORCA
, (2 years old?) swimming back and forth nearby, creating quite some commotion amongst the swimmers. Still, NONE took to the rocks. It all seemed strange to us. Could not detect any white marking on its smallish dorsal fin. -Jan Steen
