Orca Sightings for December 2, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

4:15 pm
there was a small trailing group that appeared to be foraging
south of Bush Pt,
across from Foulweather bluff closer to the Whidbey Side. We watched from about
3 pm to
3:45 pm from Bush Pt
. as they traveled spread out, heading south. A submarine passed by, one trailing group remained closer to the Whidbey side, the whales that had passed earlier headed over toward Foulweather Bluff and the Kitsap side. Difficult in windy conditions with lots of whitecaps, but great to see them coming back in on this sunny day! -Susan Berta
