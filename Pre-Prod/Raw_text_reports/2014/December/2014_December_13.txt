Orca Sightings for December 13, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were so many people on the bridge and walking the beach at
Chambers Bay
. My 10 year old son & I saw them w/ our binoculars. What a cool memory. It was our lucky day! We've been whale watching the past 3 weeks. It was so exciting to see them right off shore and right across the street from where we live. -Nancyann Boyle

They put on a heck of a show between
Chambers Bay
and the houses on the tracks to the N. No one was watching at first but soon a crowd gathered in the back yards and from CB. At first I thought they might be hunting something but it looked more like play. Lots of white water and them circling, spouting and splashing. I was watching TV and spotted the spraying water out of the corner of my eye. My home sits about 180 feet above the beach on the east side of Fox Island and close to the steep bluff. They were straight across from my house about 1/2 mile away. I-phone cam was useless and my big camera had a dead battery! I watched them for about 30 minutes as they played and drifted N with the current right near the houses to the N of CB. Once people started to gather and watch they changed their behavior and settled down. The big male circled to the outside in deeper water keeping watch mostly but he could not resist to get in on some of the play for a minute or two and then went back to standing watch. They rested a bit after the hard playing and then the big male gathered them up and was steaming S in front of CB but heading for the deeper water. It is pretty shallow in that area but the tide was high. Once they hit the ledge where the Sound drops off deep between the east shore and the reef the dove deep and I never seen them again. Boats started moving south so I would say they were headed deeper into the south Sound. Lived here 21 years and only the 3rd time I have spotted Orcas from the house. Usually they are headed south and moving fast. Great to see them stop and play. Would have been awesome if they were on the this side of the narrows.

2:33pm -
Spotted a pod just north of
Chambers Bay
close to the tracks in the shallows. Played for 30 minutes or more and last seen headed south in front of CB 30 minutes ago and dove into deeper water and never saw them again. 7 or 8 total one bull and a smaller male. -Tom Ferrari
