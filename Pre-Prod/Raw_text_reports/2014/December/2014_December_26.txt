Orca Sightings for December 26, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our family headed out in the morning from Spencer's Landing,
Shoal Bay, north end of Lopez
for a day at Sucia. Before we even picked up speed our son-in-law Bill spotted an orca a ways off to port. (It was a little after
11:00 am.) We crept along for awhile and there turned out to be 2 of them - a male and either a female or juvenile. (the male in the photo below is
J26 Mike
. This was the only report of any members of J pod Dec. 26) We were a mile or less north of Humphrey Head at that point. They surfaced several times. The female stayed further away, but the male turned and eventually swam a short distance behind our boat. He had a very tall fin, and it looked wavy along the back edge. He surfaced a couple of time behind and to the side of the boat, (yes, our motor was off,) and then continued on his way and rejoined his partner. They were heading east, What a wonderful start to the day! We were on board Bill & Carolyn McGown's boat the "Andiamo" with granddaughters Lucy and Phoebe. Carolyn took these photos. -Susan and Mike Muckle
