Orca Sightings for September 4, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Out west we found
a large group of transients
! What followed was one of the most spectacular transient displays I've ever witnessed. We had a record breaking FIVE BREACHES out of one whale! Any time a whale breaches, we consider ourselves lucky to witness it, but when a transient does it, we thank the whale gods! And 5 times in a row? That's just unheard of! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
A large group of transients, made up of the T060s, T036, T036B, T036B1, and the T109s were seen west of Secretary Island near Sooke, BC.
The whales appeared to be foraging before pushing off shore and becoming very surface active with many breaches reported. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu
