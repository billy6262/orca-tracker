Orca Sightings for September 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just LOVE fall on the water out here. There is just so much awesome wildlife to see ... It was gorgeous out there today. I got to see something I've never seen before today! We had a very close encounter with
J35 Tahlequah
. She came up to us (after we'd been sitting in the same spot for about twenty minuets), and just when I thought she was going to swim by, she turned around at the stern of the boat and circled us very slowly. She looked up at us the entire time. I'll tell you- killer whales do something to our soul. When a creature as intelligent as us, and even more magnificent, makes intentional contact with you it penetrates deep within. When you have encounters like that with killer whales, you can't help but be forever changed. Killer whales bring out the good in every human. - Heather MacIntyre

This was really cool to watch. Just to the right was a yacht I have never seen before. The whale is
J32 Rhapsody
, who swam up to the yacht, stopped and very slowly bobbed up and down vertically 5 times. Obviously checking it out. Then apparently satisfied, slowly rolled over once and continued on her way. - James Gresham

1 pm -- orcas from the shore of Galiano Island.
- Karoline and Gary Cullen

We travelled out to
San Juan Island
to spot some members of
J-pod and L-pod
. The whales were everywhere! We were "surrounded by whales!" - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

I came across
a group of California transients including CA172 and CA173 in the Juan de Fuca Strait. The T035A's, T036A's and T038A were amongst one group. T011 and T011A showed up
from the American side of the Strait early evening and shadowed them as they continued west south of Jordan River. - Mark Malleson

Over
18 Transients were found yesterday in the Juan de Fuca
. With at least
8 CA transients
traveling with some of our regular transients. - Simon Pidcock

2:28pm - A whale (probably a humpback)
came up along side our sailboat and dove under it. Saw fluke two times as well as it headed south. We saw the whale just
south of Possession Pt
on Whidbey Island. - Joanne Donohue
