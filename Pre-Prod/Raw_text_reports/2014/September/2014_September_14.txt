Orca Sightings for September 14, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw plenty of
transients just south of Race Rocks in the morning
, and even managed to see a humpback as it popped up amongst a resting transient pod on the afternoon trip. Then we caught up with the same
T60 pod
, this time a little closer to home, only a few miles south of Victoria. The afternoon tours got to enjoy the sunshine with
humpbacks
and several transient killer whale pods, including the
T60s and T11s
, along with an unidentified transient group travelling with the
T11s
. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
South Haro Strait. T60s
dining on Harbor Porpoise. -Capt. Jim Maya.

3:30 PM - J Pod off Point Roberts
. We found the J Pod this afternoon around 3 PM just off Point Roberts. They were spread out and all around us! We were treated to a few tail slaps from J34 Doublestuf and also identified J27 Blackberry. They were spread out over a wide area not moving location much...most likely feeding. - Kamriell Welty.

J pod
slowly cruising along in
St. of Georgia.
- Stephen Ellwood.

Granny (J-2) and Onyx (L-78)
today, by the
BC coal docks
. They were leisurely heading towards Point Roberts when we left them, around 3 pm. Always a treat to see Granny. - Jill Hein.
*
We began our day with the resident killer whales of
J-pod near Sand Heads Lighthouse
, at the mouth of the Fraser River. The whales did some wildlife watching of their own, using their spyhopping technique to check out the world above sea level. - Prince of Whale Whale Watch
