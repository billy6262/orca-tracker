. - MaryJoe Adams.

They are
back in Penn cove
right now....near mussel platforms.....could be viewed from Madrona Ave. I was out kayaking this AM as they came into the cove....was within 20 feet......could that have been dangerous? I quickly paddled to shore but one was in front and others behind me....they were intent on going into cove, but still felt like a very close encounter....and at eye level....they are HUGE! - Lindy Kortus

4:30 pm - 4 Orcas sighted in Penn Cove
- Hard to tell, but looks like
1 baby, 1 adult female and 2 smaller.
No photos possible, since we were on other side of cove near Capt. Whidbey Inn. looking through telescope. They were moving back and forth (hunting?) in area between Fossil Rd and Monroe Landing for about 45 minutes. Haven't seen whales in this area for many years. - Morgan Bell
