Orca Sightings for September 15, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
My first ever orca sighting....right place, right time...happened to have my camera. Quite the blessing.

12:45 PM -
Susan Skubina suggested I contact you. I was in my rowboat on the south side of the
Dungeness Spit
when I sighted
first one, then two orcas
cruising eastbound inside the bay. After passing by the light house and the tip of the spit they exited to the east. They appeared to be traveling (I like to think they were exploring). - Kip Tulin
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research: It's T11 and T11A

6:30 PM - Approx 5 Orcas in Baynes Sound near Union Bay, B.C. (NW Georgia Strait)
a small pod of orcas ravelled up Baynes Sound. First observed a mother and calf, then they were joined by others include a large male, traveling, then feeding on a seal. Saw a fantastic spy hop. :-) Tons of seals in the shallows trying to avoid the carnage. - Bruce Evans

I tracked a group of California transients along with the
T037's
westbound out the
Juan de Fuca Strait
. I originally picked them up in the morning thanks to a tip from Seahawk Charters who spotted them south of Becher Bay. I left them 3 miles offhsore of
Pt no Pt
in the afternoon when they led me to
J, K, and Lpod traveling east
in a large resting formation a half mile to the north of them. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

L41, L85
and clan inbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales.

Later in the
afternoon

J-pod

all of L-pod, and all of K-pod!
That's 69 whales! They were traveling in discrete pod groups. We spent most of our time with L-pod, 35 whales strong! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

4:30pm. -
Whales on
LK
. Being pretty quiet but they're there. - James Gresham

Hanging out with one of the newest little Biggs killer whales,
T124D1
, yesterday. Here is the little guy popping it's little head up with a pretty sweet backdrop. - Gary Sutton.

California Transients
CA172, CA173 and CA166
in the
Juan de Fuca strait
. - Mark Malleson.
*
We saw a group of transient killer whales, the
T060's off Orcas Island
. On the Victoria side, we were also looking at transients! We had a large group of about 15 spotted by skipper Mark on his first trip at 10am. Also on zodiacs were Bo and Matt today. It was a special treat to learn that one of the transient families was not one we see often; they're exotics! Not seen regularly - they were from California! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
