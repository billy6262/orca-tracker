Guess who saw little
L120

Salmon bank

We on the Peregrine were able to spend a bit of time on both our trips today with
L120

I was very excited to meet little
L120
for the first time today! He/she was born to L86 Surprise sometime in the last two weeks. The lighting wasn't the best, but it was still amazing to see such a tiny killer whale! - Monika Wieland.

I got to see my favourite group of
T's today in Trincomali Channel. The T137's
were super mellow heading west up the channel in a beautiful little resting group in flat calm conditions. We got to spend 45 minutes with them with no other boats in sight. It was good to see those familiar fins again. It was something special! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
