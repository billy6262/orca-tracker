At

3:30 PM
I watched about
15 spread out whales
slowly heading south past
Land Bank and Hannah Heights
. A bit later, some of them were heading back north, but then they turned offshore and went towards another group heading east across Haro Strait. After a couple days of being very spread out between
Eagle Point and False Bay
, it seems like all the residents finally met up in a large group. There were easily
60 whales out there, and it could have been everybody!
They all grouped up about

5:45 PM
offshore of Hannah Heights, where they were milling but generally trending south. - Monika Wieland

A
humpback
seen from cottage deck on Cliffside Rd (near
E Point, Saturna
); whale was diving in Boundary Pass from about 3-6 pm on sunday, sept 21. I think it is rare to see a humpback in this vicinity. - James McLarnon, Vancouver.

(Yogi) was near

(Haro Strait). - Mark Malleson
