============================================================

Entry 1:
From

3:15 to
4:15
this afternoon we had a
mixed group of Js and Ks
slowly heading north past
Lime Kiln
. Another group had already passed by and were further north, and there were
more whales well to the south

Orca mother and juvenile spotted off Grayland, WA
. My husband reports that yesterday while he was just off the Washington Coast, motoring in his sport fishing boat back to Westport, WA, on his way back from salmon fishing off the Long Beach peninsula, fairly close to shore he saw one female Orca and what he described as a "baby." He said it was noticeably smaller than the female. He is sure that the larger Orca was a female (curved dorsal), not a male (straight-edge dorsal). I don't know how common Transient juveniles are, so I thought I would report this sighting. They were traveling northbound. He saw both of them surface several times, before his boat outdistanced them. - Andrea Grad

Tonight was another one of those beautiful nights in
Haro Strait with Resident Orcas
serenely searching for salmon. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until we happened across this
Minke whale
on the way home! Multiple breaches. Bow riding at 15 knots...insane! What a birthday present! - Lance Underwood

Sitting in
Rosario Strait

a gray whale
play and eat. - Peace Corey
