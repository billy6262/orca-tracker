Orca Sightings for September 7, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I came across the
T069's at Carmanah
in the morning. They traveled east along the shoreline of the West Coast Trail. I left them mid day offshore of
Port Renfrew
. - Mark Malleson
*

10:55 pm. - Southern Resident greeting ceremony on LK hydro. All 3 pods
. Incredible! - James Gresham
*
Today
J's and K's were all together
in a huge resting group moving only about 1 knot heading
south in the Strait of Georgia
. FLAT calm conditions and such a beautiful and relaxed group of whales. It was one of those days that will stick out when looking back on the season. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
3 pm - Most of L pod h
eading towards
Iceberg point, from Smith Island area.
. Had quality time with them today, magic. (Did not see L120 with this group though.) - Jill Hein aboard Mystic Sea.
*
Judy from Sierra, north of Coupeville, NW Whidbey Island, called at

12:10 pm to report 8 orcas 1 mile north of Partridge Point
, traveling in a line headed north. There were several males among them.
*
The
T046Bs
were found
northeast of Port Angeles
, WA late this morning. The whales were milling about in the same area for several hours and made at least one kill. The youngsters were very playful and a lucky gull escaped a potential tail slap from one of them but did get drenched in the process. The whales were last seen traveling west. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu.
*
T046B's 30 min out from Port Angeles at Hein Bank
. - Connie Bickerton.
*
Transient killer whales reported off of Dungeness spit on the Olympic peninsula
, and they got a spectacular show. They spotted these guys right after a kill, which is the best time to see transients. They're more active, and seem to be more relaxed as they come out of hunting mode. Torin thinks they got something big because there was a large oil slick at the surface. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*

6:44am - Orca calls starting to come through on Lime kiln
. - Selena Rhodes Scofield
*

6:43am - I can hear them off lime kiln
right now, lots of boat noise too, but good clear calls as well. - Aubree Mae Renfro
*

6:41am - sounds like Transients on LK.
- Alisa Lemire Brooks

I'm writing to report a sighting of
Orcas near Bodega Canyon/Cordell Bank California
. I posted a few photos on my
blog
. Any information about them would be greatly appreciated. - Jackie Sones

A
Minke at Hein Bank
. - Connie Bickerton.

A Pacific White-Sided Dolphin
took a break from
harassing L85 Mystery
today to come hang out with us!! Having a "Lag" bow-ride is one of the most exhilarating things ... I can't even describe the feeling. Luckily, for the first time EVER, my friend snapped a shot from another boat of us! - Heather MacIntyre
