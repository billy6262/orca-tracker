Orca Sightings for April 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 orcas near Olympia at
8:30am between Boston Harbor and Squaxin Island
. At
4:30pm they were off the east shore of Cooper Point traveling south. In both sightings they were moving leisurely and close together, playing, slowly traveling. Always a thrill for us South Sounders! - Larry and Donna Brooke
*
Orcas in Budd Inlet, Olympia. I saw 2
with large dorsal fins, one with a knick and a grey marking, about 15 times. After about every third time I saw them, about 3 times I saw what looked like a huge white and black belly surfacing then sinking back down plus some splashing. Could this have been a whale in distress or one giving birth? Or some backtracking maneuver of the twins? This was at

7:45 am
as they were
heading north in Budd inlet
passing 62nd St on Cooper Point approaching Burfoot Park / Cooper Point, travelling north. - Wendy Eklund
*
I spotted
three Orca in Port Townsend bay
, due east of the ferry dock, ~500 ft SE of Taylor and Water St. in downtown Port Townsend. There were two adults and one young. One of the adults appeared to be hunting an otter or seal, the other adult was flanking the prey, while the little one was trying to keep up. One of the adults seemed clearly to be hunting what I think was a river otter. The otter swam under the back of a cruise ship, and then dock, I think. I didn't see where the Orcas went after that. - Rico Moore

, at 1

1:30 am
