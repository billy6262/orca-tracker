Orcas today. Oh sublime joy...
T137s and the T36As, Swanson Channel
. - Katie Jones
*
Sprouters
T100C and T137A
were "buddy buddy", swimming together away from the rest of the group. After observing them doing short, shallow dives for most of the encounter and travelling more-or-less on a steady course, two stellar sea lions were spotted within 100 yards of the killer whales, at which point
all 12 whales
grouped up tightly and went into "stealth" mode, taking 10 minute dives and being very sporadic. The sea lions went unmolested from what we saw, but who knows what happened when the human observers were gone! - Tasli Shaw

Two Transient/Biggs in South Sound. At 0825
we encountered two adult male Killer Whales, assumed to be
T49c and T77a
, traveling in mid-channel between
McNeil Island and the town of Steilacoom
. The two were heading south at a steady rate towards Nisqually Reach. - Kwasi Addae
