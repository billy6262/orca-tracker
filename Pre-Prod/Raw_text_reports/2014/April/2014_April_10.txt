Entry 1:
07:12 PM - 4-5 killer whales
mix of large and small spotted near

. Video of today's acrobatic cartwheeling and tail-lobbing Bigg's (Transient mammal eating) Killer whales taking down a harbor seal (not graphic) in Puget Sound off of
Richmond Beach in Shoreline

T137 and T137A

8:07 -
boy are they moving fast! Passing by
Shilshole marina
now looking from the south end of rolling bay on Bainbridge. Mid channel.

7:58 -
Looking from
rolling bay on Bainbridge
they are about to cross in front of Golden Gardens.

7:55 -
Finally spotted them! They're going to pass to the Bainbridge side of the second tanker in a minute. - Lynn Batson
*

Yes! Between G
olden Gardens and Pt. Monroe
, mid-channel.

Between
Meadow Point and Halvorsen's Buoy
. Southbound at a good clip.

Southbound! Between M
eadow Point and Indianola
. Way out. - Ben Blankenship
*
7 pm - Pod of 8 orcas.
About a mile or less off
Richmond Beach heading west towards Bainbridge
. Perhaps they were feeding or playing, they would go down and then all appear on the surface. They would come up high above the surface and seemed to be playing. - Debra Brown
*

6:22 -
Still in the same spot....for
over an hour south of the Kingston ferry lane mid channel
. - Jamie Grundhauser
*
6 pm -
Jamie Grundhauser is watching the Transients/Bigg's Whales in mid-channel,
between Richmond Beach, Edmonds and Carkeek Park
. They have been in a resting line, basically lined up side-by-side, moving slowly southward, for about ten minutes.
*

6:50 -
it looks like they've got their engines started again... moving together as a group in a SW to WSW direction, headed out towards mid-channel, pointing roughly towards
Fay Bainbridge
.

6:30pm -
they're
*
still
*
more or less parked in the same area, SW of my place in
Richmond Beach
. No sign that the whales have decided to move on. Birds are still working the area too, so there must be good bits leftover...

6:10pm -
they're still parked in roughly the same area as they were when they were working over that harbor seal around 5pm.
3-4 of them are in a resting line
facing S to SE, a couple are facing roughly NW to N a little further to the north of the S-facing resters, which is also where the birds seem to be focusing their attention.

5:00pm -
looks like it's a harbor seal they're trying to have for dinner. At least one of the whales is being very surface active... might be a prey item it's wrestling with...

4:51 -
Was able to get
a good count of 7 of them
. Transient dorsals for sure. Sounds like the same ones Brad was with earlier.

4:44 -
Seeing dorsal fins from Richmond Beach now. If you're at Kayu Kayu Ac park, that'd be a great view. They'll be visible from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in about 5-10 minutes (around

4:50-
4:55) then heading towards Carkeek shortly after that. Sticking closer to the King County side. Sorry Kitsap folks! - Dave Haas
*

4:28 -
I see them heading south into Puget sound.
Passing edmonds
. Going FAST. They are being very stealthy. I would head to Carkeek. - Sara Troyer
*

3:35 -
NOAA researchers left the whales just north of the Edmonds ferry lane, with no clear direction but trending westward. He ID'd
T137 and T137A
among a probable
total of 7
. They might continue around the south end of Whidbey and head NW, or they might go south into Puget Sound. Or for that matter they could turn around and head NE.
*
Kristine Marshall called at

1:45 pm
from the
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry
, reporting
3 orcas just south of the ferry
including 1 adult male, closer to the Clinton side. She had also seen at least
1 Gray whale
between Langley and Hat/Gedney Island earlier in the ferry crossing (the Grays are likely quite relieved the Transient orcas continued south!).
*
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called at

1:40 pm
, they are with a tight
group of Transients
just south of the
Mukilteo/Clinton
ferry run, closer to the east/ Mukilteo side, with the whales continuing south.

11 am - orcas just north of Langley

at least 5 moving east towards Everett
. - Rachel Franklin

9:28 - About 15 orcas
including a number of large males off
Hidden Beach (Greenbank)
headed north. Milling around in one spot right now. - Roger F. Clark
*
About
8 am - On the Lopez-Friday Harbor
ferry this morning, when the boat cuts its engines in the middle of the strait, it's usually a good sign - and it was.
A couple of killer whales
came by, close to the boat to say hey, then carried on. It was a little ways out from
Brown Island
- they were heading east as the ferry headed to the harbour...just a couple, possibly a male & female (by dorsal size)...shot with my little pocket camera, as you can tell...the orca shown is heading to the left, in the pic (so she might be a T). Always nice to see friends...- Ian Byington
*
Marie Lincoln of Chocolate Flower Farm just reported
a Gray whale off the Langley seawall at
5:20 pm
- the whale bell has been ringing a lot today!
*
This afternoon, around

4:30, we had a large gray whale
out in front of our house, stirring up the crawdads on the sandbar and then swimming in circles eating. We are about 1 mile
northwest of Langley
on the Saratoga passage. - Rachel Franklin
*

11:56 -
on board the island explorer 3 we have
3 gray whales
right on top of each other
south end of gedney/hat island
. Acting crazy and sticking extremely close for safety reasons due to the
group of orcas north of gedney/hat island
. - Tyrone Reed
