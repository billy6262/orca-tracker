Windy the humpback
has returned. It has almost been exactly one year to the day that she mugged the boat I was on last season, the first time she was recorded engaging in this behaviour in this area to my knowledge. This encounter surpassed the original however ....For over an hour,
Windy slowly passed around and under the boat
. The water was flat calm, allowing us to get an amazing view of her, and to give her an amazing view of us! At one point, she came parallel to the side of the boat I was standing on, rolled on her side, and just floated there, her huge blue eye peering at us for many moments. You could even see her eye open and close, the hairs on her chin, every fine detail and scar on her skin, the extreme smell of her breath. - Tasli Shaw
