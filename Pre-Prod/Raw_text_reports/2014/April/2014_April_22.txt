We were able to catch up with
a humpback traveling north along the shoreline of Saturna Island in Boundary Pass
. Thanks to the crew of the Island Roamer who spotted it while hiking up Monarch Head and reporting it to us. It was the same animal as the one seen the day before off of Victoria. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

First
Humpback Whale
of the season! The Western Prince II is viewing a Humpback Whale up in the
Canadian Gulf Islands
right now. Thanks to Mark Malleson for finding it!

They are now heading south.

12:03 - Two orcas just off West Point
. Frolicking/feeding with no direction of travel. Appeared to have made a kill of something - saw a splash of red. Very cool! - Jim Devereaux

9:41 -
Still
under the bridge
- just saw it [
gray whale
] come up again again for the 3rd time.

9:32 -
Just spotted a whale
under the narrows bridge (in Tacoma)
heading north. Not orca - didn't see find. Saw spouting. Definitely not porpoises - much bigger. Best I can tell is it's skin is bumpy & not black. Did not see any fins and looked bigger than orca although admittedly I haven't seen any this close. Direction of travel is not definite - I initially saw it a little south of the
[Narrows] bridge
, then 2 times under the bridge then just a bit south again. It was more on the
gig harbor side of the the bridge
. Waiting for it to come up again but haven't seen anything for a bit now. - Heidi Powers Armstrong

9:41 - Twins in Elliott bay
right now. Viewable from bainbridge ferry. - Wendy Horger Alsup

9:31 -
I see him from lower
Queen Anne
. Seems to be heading east getting close to the Seattle waterfront. - Katie Kirking

We also watched for awhile from our office overlooking
Myrtle Edwards (Park, in mid-downtown Seattle).
I shoot full-frame with a 70-200, and they were WAY too far out to get any good shots. - Mik Nei

I saw
a single orca in that area around
8:40 a.m. The fin was visible from downtown
. - Holly Bowen

8:30 - Single orca off West Seattle

A passenger on the
