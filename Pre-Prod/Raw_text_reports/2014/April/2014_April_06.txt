I was coming back from Fort Worden State Park Port Townsend, after a day of watching
2 gray whales
/ possibly a calf swimming in the area. On my way home, when crossing the
Hood Canal bridge @
4:30 the same time, I saw many porpoises surfacing parallel to the bridge.. white sided dolphins?
wish I could of had a better look as I was traveling across the bridge at a high speed. - Kathe Bradley

From Rob Taylor: I vote white sides too. I crossed the hood canal bridge at

4:30 (
April 6) and there were 30-40 scattered on each side of the bridge
, surfacing every twenty yards or so. It was amazing, but what I saw weren't orcas.
