A mother
Gray
with her calf sighted heading north along the west shore of
Point Lowell, Camano Island
. The pair were moving slow with frequent blows (every minute or so). We watched them from the beach just north of the boat dock at Camano State Park as they came up from the south, easing along the shore of Point Lowell until they disappeared to the north heading directly toward Crescent Harbor. - Rob Plaza
Note: No gray whale calves have be confirmed. All the Saratoga Grays are believed to be males.
