I was leading a paddle with 7 Kayakers from the Purdy Spit to Cutts Island, as we approached Allen Pt we sighted a group of
Orcas traveling north in Henderson Bay
(near Gig Harbor). We counted
at least 6 in the group
, 2 of which had very tall pronounced dorsal fins. The group was very active and playful. We witnessed several pectoral fin slaps, tail fin slaps, lots of playing and splashing. - Jason Learned

John Rogstad of WSF called to relay a report from the ferry Kennewick on the Port Townsend/Coupeville run -
a pod of 6-8 orcas
, heading south into Admiralty Inlet. They also report some small boats chasing the whales.

I was awakened this morning with a steaming cup o' joe and four words every PNW woman wants to hear, "The whales are here." Jumped (a relative verb at my age) out of bed, grabbed my camera, and shot the ballet happening before our eyes.

whale. They spin slowly, hypnotically, using their fins to stir up the ghost shrimp embedded in the sand below, and then feast. Also saw my first fluke on the Mystic Sea cruise last Friday night to benefit our new Langley Whale Center. I guess you could say it has been one whale of a week on Whidbey Island. Looking forward to the Welcome the Whales parade on the 19th. These magnificent creatures deserve a formal 'Welcome." - Debra Campbell

Alisa Lemire Brooks spotted
THREE gray whales entering Port Susan!
On her way to staff the Langley Whale Center today, so glad she was rewarded with a whale sighting to start the day!
