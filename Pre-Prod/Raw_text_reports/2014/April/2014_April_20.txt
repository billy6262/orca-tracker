Orca Sightings for April 20, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just returned to Shilshole on my boat after sailing with
a gray whale mid channel due west of Shilshole south bound
. Shots taken at about
5pm
. - Gary Peterson
*

12:17 - #723 Gray whale on North side Hat Island (Gedney)
.
2 male orca traveling South. South side of Camano head.
*
T049C & T077A in Mukilteo
, 30-50 yards from the
Port of Everett pier
. They pummeled a little Harbor seal but didn't kill her/him. The seal either miraculously got away or they just like to practice pummeling little guys and move on. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
A call came in from April saying she had been watching
two orcas from her home at Mukilteo Drive in Mukilteo
,
from about
3:30 until about
7:15 pm
.

Ed's video (below) of the "twins"
T049C & T077A
hunting just yards off the
Port of Everett Pier in Mukilteo
last night from

6:00pm-
6:50pm
. The hunt did not end with a kill but a warning for anyone who is sensitive, the Harbor seal is visible throughout most of the video getting beat up by these two big boys. Interesting to see their coordinated and individual skills with their prey. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

6:40 -
Just got a report from someone on the
Bainbridge Isl-Seattle ferry
, who saw 1 dorsal fin between the two ferries at

5:55 pm
, the whale was heading east toward Seattle. Not sure if this is the same as the orcas being reported off Mukilteo earlier or not. (Note: Not the same.)
*
Out on the Island Explorer 3 with
T77A and T49C near Everett
. They cornered a harbor seal and then launched it into the air. Incredible. - Michael P Colahan
*
We were at
Lighthouse Park, Mukilteo
about

5:00ish and saw two Orca Whales in the Puget Sound
. We watched them traveling side by side for about 5 minutes as they headed out past the ferry launch. - Jean Bundas
*

5:15 PM - Two orcas sighted in Mukilteo
! We observed mating 1/2 mile south of Mukilteo Ferry Dock, 100 yards off shore on East side of Humpy Hollow. We were able to watch their mating ritual for approximately 15 minutes before they continued on. We watched them circling each other on the surface and then roll onto their sides next to one another. Eventually one rolled on top of the other which lasted a minute. - Alexa Lamey

Saw them from
5 pm ferry to Clinton
. They were south. - Gwendolyn Clemens

4:20 PM - 2 orca
, swimming in circular patterns. Going under water, and coming up often for air.
Mukilteo south
of the ferry dock, below Horizon Dr. - Rebecca Baker

4:00 PM - 2 Orca whales off of Mukilteo Beach
, off the tank farm in Mukilteo heading towards the ferry. Traveling - the ferry stopped for at least 5 min to let them pass. The tide was low and we heard them before we saw them. So cool. This is my first Orca sighting. - Heidi Fretland
