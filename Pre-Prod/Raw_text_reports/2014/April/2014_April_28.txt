Orca Sightings for April 28, 2014

Entry 1:
A long one today but it was worth the ride to get my first look at
T65A5! The 65As
were coming east from
Race Rocks
as we headed down and caught up with them around Constance bank. They picked off a seal right as we got there and started the celebration.....breaches, spy hops........love that group. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
