============================================================

Entry 1:
Visiting the
T11's and T137's near Everett
this week aboard the Island Explorer 3. - Michael P Colahan

. - Monty McCormick

Magical day on "Mystic Sea" with
gray whales
and the unexpected bonus of
five transient orca at
11:30 am
including Big Daddy (not official designation!) and a calf. Big Daddy with his ruffled dorsal fin (so like our much loved resident orca Ruffles) paired up with another male heading towards Hat Island while passing a gray whale closer inshore and stopping the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
to give thrilled passengers a rare treat. All five whales grouped up and circled for a kill, although there was no evidence on the surface other than wheeling gulls. Another perfect day in the wonderful Pacific Northwest. Sandra Pollard, Naturalist on "Mystic Sea." - Sandy Pollard

The
K's as they traveled down Colvos Passage
on Monday. Taken from a dock in Olalla. - Katie Schmelzer

Kpod heading down Colvos Passage

Crazy and wonderful. What a day - I don't even know where to post with so many different threads from so many whales! Amazing to be surrounded by fins and in the warmth of the sun - very rare for those of us down yonder in Central Puget Sound. Not sure when I screamed loudest today - I whooped once when I realized we had Ks and also hooted exuberantly when just after watching
K's head down the narrows
( after moving down the
West side of Vashon Island)
, I turned around and saw the Big ol dorsals of the twin T's moving in from the East side. Saving my last holler for the hopeful blood moon that is on the rise. What might tomorrow bring? - Amy Carey

We went to a dead stop because we lost sight of it. A seal popped up right next to the ferry, then an orca popped up and rolled and the seal was gone. It was happening right alongside the ferry. Proof that it pays off to stop the props if you have any doubt as to where they are. - Zachary Heistand

They didn't travel very far each of these times, then after about the 6th "blow" we didn't see them again (even though they hadn't been that far away so they definitely did some traveling or went deep after that last breath). - Tracy Delphia
