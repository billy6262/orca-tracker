Orca Sightings for April 29, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
This is about the last thing I expected us to find on our trip today...but HEY! We'll take it!
About 12 Pacific white-sided dolphins were lolly-gagging in between Sentinel Island and Spieden Island
this afternoon. Icing on the cake! - Katie Jones

T69's, 4 animals
, initially spotted at
Schooner Cove near Long Beach, Tofino
around
noon
. We encountered them aboard the Leviathan 2 with Jamie's Whaling Station close to Frank Island, Chesterman Beach. The orcas traveled from Frank Island close to shore giving all the hotels and resorts a good look, on to Duffin Cove at the entrance to Tofino harbour, round the offshore of Vargas Island and to Cleland Island where they were left at
18:00. The animal gave a surprise breach close to their vessel, photo taken on cell phone - shows how close the activity happened! - Claire Mosley

Around

9:20am
Jon received a call that
50 killer whales were heading West past Neah Bay
. We got on the water and found them
passing Tatoosh Island
, heading Northwest. We stayed on the group for a couple hours and got photographs of many. There were about 4 or 5 smaller groups spread out over about a mile. Each smaller group was between 10-15 whales,
for total of 50-70 whales
. We thought there were at least 6 or 7 large males (some other sprouting) and about 7 calves. We are
guessing these are Northern Residents
- a couple of the males had slightly hooked dorsal fins and one looks similar to a male we saw from G pod several years ago. - Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician III, Makah Fisheries Management
