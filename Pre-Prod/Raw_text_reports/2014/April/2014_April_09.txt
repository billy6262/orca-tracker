Orca Sightings for April 9, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Had an encounter with twins today.
T49C and T77A
were found traveling together
in the Gulf Islands
. I have seen T49C before but not T77A. They are amazingly almost identical looking. Both have twin notches in just about the same place! We also found a huge chunk of lungs in San Juan Channel on the way out. I imagine from a Steller Sea Lion, but who knows. The lungs were about 20 miles away from the whales, so not sure if it was left over from these guys or another group of Transients. Notice the fresh rake marks on T49C. - Ivan Reiff

We were able to catch up with
T077A and T049C
in the morning west o
f Mandarte Island (Haro Strait)
. Thanks to Jeff on Goldwing for finding them. They killed a seal as soon as we arrived and we spent our entire time watching them sharing it with each other while the gulls picked up the scraps. In the
late afternoon
I saw them take another seal
in Navy Channel
. They then skulked along the shoreline of Mayne Island, enter the western entrance of Active Pass and then turn and head west up Trincomali Channel. Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

At

7:30 pm northbound on east side of Whidbey at Bells Beach
, about halfway over to Camano. - Angela Johnson Zink
*
Killer whales
. Just past
Clinton heading north on the east side of Whidbey
. Racing to Langley now. Looks like they went between Hat and Camano island. We saw them from
Langley
for about an hour. Looked like
a pod of about 7
. My first wild orca experience. - Danielle Doll

4:48pm
: We are enjoying
a pod northbound right now moving FAST from Possession Point to Clinton
. We took some first-timer friends in search of Grays and came up empty for 90 minutes. Imagine our surprise returning to Edmonds to have such a great encounter. Maybe our friends are good luck? The Orcas were on a mission--
8.5 MPH over ground into a 2.5 MPH outgoing tide
. Fun stuff! I can email more photos for I.D. - Jim Fahey
Dave Ellifrit: The big bull is T11A. I was just talking yesterday about wanting to see him again so send him up here! The sprouter is a little too grainy to say anything with any certainty but it MAY be T137A if his upper nick is being invisible in the grain.

We had
T49C and T77A head up Swanson Channel and Trincomali Channel
. - Dave Ellifrit
