Orca Sightings for April 8, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a great hang-out session with the
T75Bs with the T36As near Trial Island
. Then we poked our heads out a little farther into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to see the
T101s
. Pictured here is big boy T102 (T011A?)(born in 1984) with San Juan Island in the background. - Katie Jones

Thanks to reports from John @ Gotcha Fishing Charters, Roy @ Blue Wolf Charters, and Paul @ Sooke Coastal I was able to pick up the
T101's at Constance Bank and the T075B's and T036A's following behind
. Both groups were traveling east. - Mark Malleson
*
We had a great day out on the water with a group of transients today. We got a call at

9:30AM
from local whale watcher Paul Pudwell with Sooke Coastal Explorations. He was with
a large group of transients
feeding at
Race Rocks Pacific Ecological Reserve
. By the time we left our station at Pedder Bay they were headed east in Constance Bank, split into two groups. We were able to identify them as the
T101s
, the same whales spotted in Puget Sound near Seattle Washington a few days earlier. They were spread out foraging and doing 4-10 min dives. We followed them towards Trail Island light house. - Josh McInnes
*
We just got a report of
15-20 transients off Race Rocks near Victoria BC at
9:30AM
. Thank you Paul Pudwell for the report. - Josh McInnes

5:45pm - Saw a grey on the way to Everett in Saratoga Passage
, south of Langley, before Sandy Point, close to Camano. - Buzz Mersereau

This morning at
10 am 2 gray whales seen at Chito beach (west of Sekiu)
, moving steadily west and lost to sight. Myself and two other observers. - Janet Partlow
