yesterday afternoon in the
Strait of Georgia

A glorious day for whale watching on "Mystic Sea." Making our way towards a heart-shaped blow silhouetted by the sunshine, we met up with
No. 56
as we headed towards Everett. Soon
No. 49 (Patch) and No. 53 (Little Patch)
swam into view, delighting passengers with the unforgettable smell of whale breath drifting on the light breeze. So good to be on the water with our visiting whales on such a calm sunny afternoon. - Sandra Pollard

I finally caught a glimpse of one this morning;

10:30 Clinton-Mukilteo boat
, half way through the route about 600 yards north towards Hat Island. Slow brief rolls on the surface and then it submerged for quite some time before breaching to breathe. - Jason Kidd
