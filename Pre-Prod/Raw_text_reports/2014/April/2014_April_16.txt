Orca Sightings for April 16, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:52 PM -
sighting off of
Fox Island
. Saw
at least one Orca traveling past Fox Island
. I noticed at least one seal that kept popping up in front of the house by the beach. I happened to look up and see the whale come up three times before it disappeared. So amazing! I've never actually seen one in person! Appeared to be traveling. I also saw seals in the area, they were closer to the beach and staying away from the whales. - Hannah Gilman

We were lucky today. We left Pedder Bay at
11:30AM and as we were passing
Race Rocks Pacific Ecological Reserve
when we bumped into a large group of transients. The transients were moving west in three different groups:
T011s (T011 and T011A), T065As (T065A, T065A2, T065A3, T065A4 and new calf T065A5) and T137s (T137, T137A, T137B and T137D)
. We followed the transients for 2.5 hours and left them
at Sooke BC
. They foraged on one harbor seal off Church rock, but majority of the behavior exhibited was socializing. - Josh McInnes

I came across the
T11's, T036A's, T065A's, and the T137's
west bound in Race Passage in the morning. I left them at
1420 in Becher Bay
tracking west along the shoreline. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

I'm with the Transient Killer Whale Project. Myself and Josh McInnes were just out with the
T137s, T11s, and T65As off of Race Rocks
. We followed them for 2 and a half hours to Sooke. Excellent day out on the water, lots of socializing behavior observed. - Kelsey Cullen

2 pods of four orcas in each

off Otter Creek, at
