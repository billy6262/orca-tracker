Orca Sightings for April 26, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pictures of the
orca seen at the Point Reyes Lighthouse
from visitors, volunteers, and rangers! An incredibly rare sighting at the lighthouse - for the three+ years I have worked here, we have had warnings that orca were headed our way but have never seen them and caught them on camera! This is the second time an orca pod has been sighted since I started working.
Photo believed taken by Anela Marie Ramos of
at least 11 orcas lined up side by side, apparently members of K pod and/or L pod
.

Yup -
T077A and T049C - off Beechy Head, Sooke about
3:30 pm, headed west
. I think Eagle Wing Tours and others from vic might have been heading out to find them. - Marcie Callewaert

I just heard over the radio
they are heading straight out for open water
. I think our time with them is numbered. Not sure where they are though. Just direction. - Liz Fincher

Beautiful day on the water. As far as whales it was
5-6 Minke
. All being slinky. Not one did more than one breath at the surface all day. - James Gresham

area today. - Marcie Callewaert
