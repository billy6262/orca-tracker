============================================================

Entry 1:
We had the
T065's, 86A's and 124A's in Boundary Pass
in the morning. The T065's split off and headed north while the 86A's and 124A's continued south down Sidney Channel in the afternoon. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

Awesome day today along the
Galiano shoreline
with
T87, T124 and the T90'
s. Almost all the other boats ended up
in Boundary Pass with a large group of T's
and we had these guys in the Strait of Georgia along Galiano. Very mellow just cruising steadily up the shoreline but so beautiful! It's amazing how you just never get tired of seeing them. Here are a few shots! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
