Orca Sightings for October 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas were mid channel between Mukilteo and Clinton at about
21:30 hours.
I had the pleasure of watching them play off the stern of the ferry. Amazing sight with the lights of Mukilteo behind them. - Scott Weaver
*

6:34 -
in waning light lead males committed to northbound up
Possession Sound, east side of Whidbey
with at least
12-15
that we can see behind heading north as well. Hard to see if any headed up Admiralty...all still so spread out. Some of the more westerly groups may have peeled up northwest into Admiralty (or not) but definitely very large group stayed this side of Whidbey. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
Some
whales in front of Woodway and Point Edwards (Edmonds)
. - Cheryl Lynne Langesater
*

5:45 - I'm at Richmond beach,
just watched
several orcas pass through
, mid channel. - Dori Dace
*

5:50 -
Alisa Lemire Brooks is still seeing
whales spread out from the Edmonds marina to Point Wells
, and some of them started exhibiting feeding behavior (turning, lunging, etc) just before they reached Pt. Wells, but they are continuing their travel north.
*

4:24 -
I can see them from the green staircase at
Carkeek
. Not too far out but pretty difficult to see because of the fog. Steadily heading north. - Sara Troyer
*
4pm -
great (but wet) viewing right now from
Bainbridge
side - Valley Rd at Manitou Beach Dr. - Lynn Batson
*

4:40 -
from
Carkeek
see them between us and
Port Madison
in small groups spread out across mid channel. Visibility mostly poor but comes and goes with the rain.

3:55 -
what looks to be leaders, 2 big boys and female or young guy,
mid channel due west of Shilshole marina
. Traveling at a steady pace still northbound. Visibility getting worse with this rain.

3:35 - yay! Seeing them porpoising northbound at and north of green buoy off
West Point lighthouse
! Argosy boat on scene along with noaa still and couple other small boats. - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

3:30 - Orcas seen from the ferry
. Most of them have past north through the
Bainbridge-Seattle ferry lane
. Another great sighting! - Lila Pharis
*
Brad Hanson of the NW Fisheries Science Center was with
J pod, K pod and some of L pod
today from Three
Tree Point (south Burien) back north to West Point
(north of Seattle). He didn't see any foraging behavior. The whales spread out into groups separated by 1/2 to 3/4 mile by the time they reached the north end of Vashon Island. They may not have found enough chum salmon to continue south as they normally do and and return northward up Colvos Passage. Instead they turned around near Point Robinson.
*

3:10 -
I watched a group of 3-5(?), through binoculars, closer to
Bainbridge
-side, from Seattle on the bridge near the Olympic Sculpture Park. - Kaarina Makowski

The Southern Resident Killer Whales visited
Vashon Island
today! Here are a couple of them (mother J22, born in 1985, and her son J34, born in 1998) swimming within yards of Point Robinson, with Mount Rainier towering in the distance behind Des Moines.
A classic "ID shot" of
J26 Mike
, showing his tall, straight dorsal fin and open saddle patch. J26 was born in 1991, and as he matured into adulthood, his dorsal fin "sprouted" from a short curve into this magnificent shape. At the same time (not shown here) his pectoral fins grew larger and more powerful, and the tips of his tail flukes curled downward. These changes make killer whales one of the most sexually dimorphic species.
J38 Cookie
, born in 2003, is just starting to sprout his dorsal fin. It will continue to grow taller and straighter in the years to come, helping to identify Cookie and his family. K13 Skagit strutted her stuff with a big cartwheel at Point Robinson this morning!

Looking towards the Olympic Mountains out through

There were
orcas in Friday Harbor, maybe a group of eight
, looked like all females (or at least no large males) and they were right
across from the UW labs
