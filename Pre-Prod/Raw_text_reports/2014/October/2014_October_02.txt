Orca Sightings for October 2, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
J and K pod was headed west late in the day or night
. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
*
We found the residents! Mostly
J-pod (plus Onyx! L87) but K's were there
as well, spread out, and hanging out. They weren't in a hurry to go anywhere, and were just milling in groups of two to five. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
*

12:10 am - The orcas are back on Lime Kiln Hydrophones
!! Want to hear them? Go to orcasound.net. - John Boyd
*
One of the
T49As, T49Bs, and T65Bs in Swanson Channel, BC
. - James Mead Maya
*
The first thing we found was
a humpback
. It was feeding, and moving very sporadically, and proved to be hard to keep track of. Later in the day four more humpbacks showed up to feed in this same area. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
*
Humpback lunge feeding off of Victoria
, confirming that humpbacks are finding food in the Salish Sea. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
*

6:57 -
Saw two deep dives east of the point at
Point No Point
. Too dark for pictures. - Connie Bickerton
*
Watching
a whale at Point No Point at
6:30
tonight! - Elyse Sollitto
*
At
Point No Point a single humpback
was feeding just off shore from

5:00pm to
6:20 pm
tonight, and was still feeding when I left. It was going back and forth having quite the meal from the east side of the light house to the north shore. - Dianne Dee Iverson
*
4 pm - From Bush Point, two humpbacks
still there, somewhere out in the middle of the Possession Triangle, between Kingston and maybe Shoreline, now maybe a or two mile apart.

3:35 pm -
just saw
another spout
! Getting VERY hazy, but the spout is still in the area near where they were first seen - from here (south of Bush Pt, Whidbey Isl) they are
just south of the group of cell towers above Edmonds
, south of the Edmonds ferry.

2:09 - two more spouts
seen. From here (Whidbey) on the top of the hill behind the whales are a bunch of big cell towers - not sure if that would line up for you Connie but it might give you the general direction to look.

2:04 pm -
just saw a few more spouts and sun glinting off the whales. There have to be at least two, saw
two spouts
in different places but timed close together. They may be a bit further south than the first sighting.
WHALE SIGHTING!!! Just now (

1:15 pm
) are seeing spouts and what looks like whales diving in the area between Edmonds, Pt No Point & Possession Point! Too far to tell for sure, but the spouts look huge (thinking humpback?) but there were at least 2 as we saw several spouts in a short time. The distance might be making the spouts look bigger than they are. - Susan Berta
