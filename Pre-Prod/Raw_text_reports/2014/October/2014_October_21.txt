f Kill Devil Hills, in the outer banks of North Carolina

Humpbacks
were all over the place and being super social! Humpbacks are not social whales like orcas. They generally travel alone, although occasionally join up into feeding groups, and of course congregate in large numbers in their breeding grounds. But it's always a treat for us to see multiple humpbacks together, and today there was hardly a lone humpback to be found! From the Victoria waterfront we found them instantly! Two here, two over there, three over there. Blows everywhere! The water looked like it was steaming. Jeff estimated there were
at least 12 whales
in the immediate area! All the whales were behaving differently; we had some doing long dives and showing off their flukes. Others staying much longer at the surface, but keeping their flukes hidden. The flukes we did spot revealed a few newcomers to the area! - Jennifer Dickson
