Orca Sightings for October 31, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We did a wide sweep south and west and eventually caught up with a group of
three humpback whales off of Becher Bay
(ten miles SW of Victoria). Three is pretty much the largest group we see humpbacks traveling in. So I immediately thought that it might be the same trio. Upon closer inspection we concluded that two of the humpbacks were the same, but they had a new buddy! Again, this is pretty typical of humpbacks; they're not social, and they don't form long-lived bonds. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

As we were returning to the harbour we were paralleling the
Coho ferry (Victoria to Port Angeles) when we spotted Pacific white-sided dolphins
riding her bow! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
