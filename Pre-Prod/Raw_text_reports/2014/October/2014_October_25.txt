4:20 pm -
Roxanne Dalla Pozza called to report a good sized pod, including young ones, was sighted 1/4 miles south of the Eglon boat ramp (near Kingston) heading south between Eglon & Kingston.
*

3:40-4
- one very large male - heading south from
Point No Point,
very fast rate of speed. No longer visible here. - Diane Russell

Good job Steve Smith and Durand Dace- it was cold and very wet at
PNP
but we were SO BLESSED with Orcas swimming south at a good clip in small groups of 2-4, a porpoise pod, harbor seals, and a river otter. Did anyone catch a clear photo of the large seabirds that were fishing about 50 yards off the beach? Trying to i.d., have not seen them before. I did not have my camera of course Nice to finally meet some fellow Orca enthusiasts in the field. - Donna Green Van Renselaar

3:22 -
We're seeing whales at
Point No Point
. - Elyse Margaret
*
Distant spyhop seen from
Point No Point
. - Steve Smith
*

3:25 -
I believe all or most orcas are now south of the
Hood canal entrance
, along the north shore of the Kitsap Peninsula between Foulweather Bluff (earning its name today!) and Point No Point. But the rain and clouds have taken over, can barely see the water now - hope they travel close to shore further south so we know what direction they go after they pass Pt. No Point!
2 pm -
saw first orcas here off our place just
south of Bush Pt
- more reported by Jan Bell and Elsa Leavitt coming down from Bush Pt. Unfortunately pouring rain and diminishing visibility have arrived with the whales! But seeing lots of tail lobs,direction changes and foraging behavior - no wonder it has taken them so long to get down here! That is GREAT news, as it appears there are a lot of fish for them out there - yay!! - Susan Berta
*
L91 and L82 heading south past the west side of Whidbey, from Bush Pt
. - Rachel Haight
*

2:00 PM - Orca off Whidbey Island
. Spotted about
25-30 orcas early afternoon off Lagoon Pt.
moving south. Looks like they were just traveling and playing. Some breaching. Widely distributed across sound. - Roxane Webb
*
What a treat! A graceful parade of
Southern Resident orcas in Admiralty Inlet
today. We saw porpoising, spy-hops, numerous resounding tail-slaps, breaches and waving pecs as they made their way steadily south past
Lagoon Point
around

12:30 pm
, some in small groups, others a little more spread out, with a few foraging stops along the way. Good to see so many people enjoying the magnificent spectacle of our iconic whales in the wild, hopefully finding plenty of food on their travels. - Sandra Pollard, Whidbey Island
*

11:14 -
Just spotted them....their just north of the
lighthouse at Fort Casey
......maybe 3/4 of a mile off shore. - Dan Gulden
*

12:07 -
There are orcas spread out all over....it's crazy! Even some breaching.

11:03 - Mark Ripley at Ebey's Landing on Whidbey Island sees quite a few orcas
just entering Admiralty Inlet
, heading south near Pt. Wilson, north of Port Townsend.
*

9:08 - Approx 20 Orcas @ 9 am between Pt. partridge and Ebey's Landing heading south
...spread out ~ 1-2 miles from shore. - Al Luneman

Between

8:00-
8:40am - Orca Sighting-Libbey Beach Area
. Spotted
30+ Orcas
traveling south in the area just north of Libbey Beach/Point Partridge. - Brenda Dewey
*
It was such an intense day! It really felt like fall out there.....choppy seas, cold wind, baker covered in snow and, of course, WHALES! Got to hang out with none other than my favourite group of Biggs, the
T137's with the T36A's right outside of Active Pass
, in the Strait of Georgia. They spent most of the encounter hunting a seal. The matriarchs and the big guy, T137A, stayed out for the most part and let the kids do the work. It was amazing to see the school of carnage take place before our eyes. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
Got to hang out with
a couple Humpbacks in the Strait of Georgia (BCZ0180
and a friend who never fluked). The cartwheel from BCZ0180 was pretty sweet. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
7 humpback whales in the vicinity of Race Rocks, Vctoria BC
. A mother and her calf were spotted 1/4 west of race rocks at
2pm
. Another mother and her calf were spotted parallel to the other mother and calf just a mile behind. A single humpback was spotted
1 mile south of race rocks
at roughly the same time. Another single humpback was spotted roughly 2 miles south east of the Victoria harbor inlet. All humpbacks appear to be traveling south east east on a heading of 100
*
at roughly 4-8 knots. - Woody Tongrugs
