Entry 1:
4:09pm - Two humpbacks between Shipwreck (about 4 miles south of Mukilteo) and Possession Pt
(south end of Whidbey Island), a couple breaches and tail slaps. At 4pm, direction appears to be northbound inside Whidbey. Yay!! - Rob Miller

Humpback whale
. No breaching, boat approaching, caudal-peduncle lobbing, spy hopping, pec fin or chin slapping, lunge feeding or any other spectacular humpie behaviors. Just traveling along and fluking on every deep dive. In a quick scan through the catalog, I didn't see this one. - James Gresham
