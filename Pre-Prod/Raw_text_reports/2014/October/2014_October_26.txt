2 pods, approximately 12 or so, heading north but what was concerning were the gill-net boats that had strung their nets across the sound except for mid channel the orcas were heading for the nets when one of the boats started to chase the one pod and he came extremely close to several of the orcas which was quite concerning. I wish they would stop gill netting in the sound for the safety of those beautiful animals. - Margaret Steen

Hands down one of the best humpback encounters I have ever had. Spent the afternoon with
at least NINE different humpbacks between Stuart, Moresby, and Pender Island
. They were socializing, wrestling, breaching, pec slapping, tail slapping, cartwheeling, kelping, aerial scanning, tail waving, lunging, and rolling!!! Never seen anything like it!! - Melisa Pinnow
*
This morning Mark went east from Victoria and picked up
a mother and calf humpback in Haro Strait
. The mothers and calves are getting harder to tell apart from the pairs of adults we sometimes see. The calves have grown so much since the beginning of the season! Which of course is what we like to see! Out west there were
like 5 humpbacks between Victoria and Race Rocks
! Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
