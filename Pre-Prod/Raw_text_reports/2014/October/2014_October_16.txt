Orca Sightings for October 16, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:09 -
once the light dimmed and we could no longer see them, we stood on the shore listening to the sound of their blows...it's the greatest sound for us Orcaholics. So peaceful and humbling. - Elyse Margaret
*

6:20 -
They've slowed down, spread out from possession sound back to
Useless Bay
.

6:10 -
group of maybe twenty porpoising south, almost to the end of the point -mid channel.

6:05 -
Watching a group heading east along the cliff east of
Double Bluff
. Lots of breaching and tail slaps. - Connie Bickerton
*
We watched
MANY dozens of Southern Resident orcas head down Admiralty Inlet
, past Whidbey Island on their way into Puget Sound. - Susan Berta, Orca Network
*
What a privilege to watch this grand entrance of
SRKW
today! I watched from the deck
south of Bush Point
and saw some of the breaches & resting line. The orcas came by close enough I could hear the blows & breaches. Gave me chills even in the warm sunshine! - Wendy Berta Sines
*

5:31 pm -
A resting line about a mile north of
Hansville
, heading SE toward Point No Point. - Howard Garrett
*
Just spotted
3 or more Orcas
passing
Mutiny Bay about
5:10
and heading toward
Double Bluff
. They were about 2 miles out from Whidbey. - Robert Armbruster
*
An Orca shows off its hunting skills and catch at the surface. With
J-Pod
off the
western side of San Juan Island
actively hunting salmon. - Puget Exposure Photography
*
About
1 mile SSW of Possession buoy at
5:10
. They now appear to be slowly moving south.

4:33 -
We just saw a second spout from a definite second whale. Still in the same general area.
One of the
humpbacks is at Possession at
3:45
and milling around. Haven't seen anything that suggests both are there yet. Last saw spouts about 10 minutes ago. Still milling around straight west of the shipwreck. Thought I'd lost them, looked through binocs and saw one diving. Fabulous afternoon! - Rob and Cassandra Miller
