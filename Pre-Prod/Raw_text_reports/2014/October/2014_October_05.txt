Orca Sightings for October 5, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw
members of all three Pods today on west side
..not sure exactly where but beautiful day! Lots of whales, some "frisky" activity going on so hopefully new babies next year!! I met a young lady from Romania whose dream was to see Orcas! She was blessed today with a awesome encounter!! Also saw Tucker the Orca poop sniffing research assistant doggie. - Melissa Kaday
*
West of Hein bank
(3-4 miles south of San Juan Island). It was a crazy
mix of Js and Ks with a few Ls scattered in
. We had amazing groups just logging at the surface, it almost looked like they were all rubbing melons and we could hear vocals above the surface!! One of the most special days out there this season. - Gary Sutton
*
SRKWs west bound in the Juan de Fuca
. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

Commencement Bay
heading towards the Pt. Defiance ferry dock. A
Pacific white-sided dolphin
followed my boat while I was fishing for about 30 minutes. - Dave Calhoun
*
We found
2 Minke whales
... And
all three southern resident killer whale pods
... And
12 Pacific white-sided dolphins.
.. And
two humpbacks
...ALL IN THE SAME PLACE! The dolphins were traveling right alongside, and often intermixed with the killer whales, and the Minkes and humpbacks kept popping up right in the thick of things as well. Chaos! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

4:16: Saw two humpbacks
just south of
Possession Point
(south end of Whidbey Island), playing. Too many tail slaps to count. A couple of breaches too. Incredible!!! - Cassandra Miller

From
Kingston ferry
just saw them south of ferry and heading east from shore.

9:47am - 2 or 3 humpbacks off Edmonds
, north of ferry, just off Sunset! I saw 3 fluke up dives, the last looked like headed at Sunset. I'm on ferry and first saw them before we left Edmonds, then again after we left. They were pretty close to shore. - Michelle Goll
*
We were in a fishing boat and followed the
humpback
this morning. Actually only looked like one but was moving quickly off from north of Sunset and then
toward Edmonds Ferry lanes
going South.
Saw him yesterday (10/4)
breaching and tail slapping in that same area and then around Whidbey
(Skachet Head)
about
10am to 11am.

a beautiful Humpback

Humpback Whales out front of Sooke
- at Strait of Juan de Fuca. - Sooke Coastal Explorations

9:15 am - Minke whale
traveling east to west along the
NW tip of Quimper Peninsula
1 mile NE of Cape George (NW of Port Townsend). Surfaced 3 times twice about 4 minutes apart. Small dorsal. No head shown when porpoising. Clear skies. Water surface flat calm. No wind. Some feeding sea birds but no dense concentrations. - Tony Petrillo

A
right whale
was reported heading west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, at milepost 8, which is 8 miles east of the Makah reservation at Neah Bay. Jerry George, nature writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, saw the right whale from his window at
5 pm
, about 1/4 mile from shore by a kelp bed. It had a 3' gash in the blubber layer along its upper left side about midway between the blow hole and peduncle. He saw the white collosities on the rostrum and there was no dorsal fin. He was not able to take any photos.
According to Wikipedia: "The Northeast Pacific subpopulation, which summers in the southeastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, may have no more than 50 animals... According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth."

While returning from south sound, passing through
Carr Inlet
, south Puget Sound, 6 of us, in 3 different sailboats, saw
2 sea otters
floating by! My husband and I have seen many sea otters in Clayoquot Sound, and they have been reported around Pt Townsend, but not down into Puget Sound. Such a delightful discovery! - Katie Bunnell
Kim Merriman reports: We have had at least one sea otter in Eld Inlet each of the past several (3-4) years. I have him/her on film and on video. The sightings have been reported each time to the proper agencies. And it is very cool to see them
.
