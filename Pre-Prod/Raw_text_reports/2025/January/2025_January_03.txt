Link to more photos. -photos & IDs by Cindi Crowder Rausch, January 3, 2025 * K37 Rainshadow - I got to Possession beach in time for a beautiful pass by K Pod this morning in the pouring rain. I didn’t know if I’d get a single decent picture, and I don’t know if it’s in spite of, or because of, the rain, but I thought these had an almost ghostly quality and I love them! The last pic is of the whale whisperer herself, Rachel Haight, and the spotter extraordinaire, Cindi Crowder Rausch, who I had fun getting soaked with today!
