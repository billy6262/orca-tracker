Well this has been an amazing day for
Grays
! Patch was definitely in our neighbor hood around

2:00pm
. He fed in the mud flats between Baby Island and East Point, swam out, then came back in again. Then, Patch began to move south toward the tip of East Point. Patch headed for the point and the boat just came charging in full speed ahead.

About

7:00am
today, I heard very loud blows near the beach below us (East Pt, Saratoga Psg). By the time I got down there, whatever
Gray
was there was gone. All I could tell was that it was moving along East Point, then headed towards Bellâ€™s Beach. I could hear the blows moving off, but it was too far gone by the time we got there.
