Orca Sightings for March 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was between Cape Flattery and Lapush onboard the RV Cascade of Port Townsend south bound for a survey of a sunken FV. I saw two groups of
gray
whales I estimate 8-10 whales total and then around
0930
an adult male and one female Orca. All were traveling north 4nm offshore.

gray
whales in the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes, heading south. Cascadia Research was onboard & said one of the whales was #56, with another larger whale today - so far they've ID'd 5 resident grays in the area now, & possibly 7.

Just north of Langley, mid channel about 5: 00 PM. Two

swimming in sync, shallow dives, then tail flukes. Looked like mom and baby. A third gray was off further north.
