Taylor Kissinger called in a report of 1 male & 1 female

A neighbor told me this

that while paddling in Seattle's Shilshole Marina he encountered a
grey
whale.

Yesterday on the ferry on the way to the SEATAC I thought I saw a spout. It rose up a bit again (we only saw part of the back) and blew one more time, but this time all three of us got to see it. I'm guessing it was a
gray
based on location and lack of a dorsal fin. We were on the

9:30 am
ferry. The whale was heading for the Saratoga passage.

Ken Balcomb called tonight to relay a report from Brad Hanson of the NWFSC, who is out on the NOAA ship McArthur looking for whales....Brad got my call about the
orcas
sighted off the mouth of the Columbia River this morning (see report below) & they turned the ship around & found the pod at about
3 pm
, 12 miles offshore, & identified them as at least 3 sub groups of L pod! They were traveling south, & the ship was following them this evening until they have to head back to port.

Just watched 2
grays
pass by my house at
~
4:30 pm
, heading south past Race Lagoon (near Penn Cove). Mystic Charters was near by, so am sure they’ll be able to identify who they were. We watched them for approx 20 minutes as they slowly headed south, their flukes were very visible but too far for a decent picture.

2:30pm
one lone
Gray
whale spotted between Camano head and Gedney Is. It was making long deep dives and moving about 1/4 to 1/2 mile between sightings.

3:45pm
- Three grays were working down the shore from Harington Lagoon to Race Lagoon. They may have been feeding but were travelling down the shoreline as we watched.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called & reported 3, maybe 4
gray
whales off Scatchet Head, SW Whidbey Island at

12:30 pm
, feeding in the water column between Scatchet Head & Possession Pt. ID'd #53. Yesterday they had # 53 & # 22.
*
We received a message from Warren Hartman, a whale watch volunteer at Lewis & Clark Interp. Ctr. reporting 4 - 6
orcas
off the north Jetty from
11 -
11:15 am
. They had 2 other unidentified groups of whales reported the previous 2 days in the morning as well, that he thought may also have been orcas.

At least 2
gray
whales were feeding in front of Langley this morning at

3:40 AM
. They stayed for about a ½ hour and were heading east. And there was a single gray whale this morning at
6:20 again feeding in front of Langley and heading east.
