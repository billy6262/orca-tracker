Orca Sightings for March 20, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Add to the flurry of
gray
whales 6-8 individuals we encountered while surveying off the outer coast. The majority were northbound migrants, but we did find one small whale well inside Grays Harbor. Aside from these sightings it was a very quiet day offshore, with only a few additional harbor porpoise and pinniped encounters.

9:20
, The
gray
whale, “Patch” just came along feeding along the beach, north of Langley, heading east. A kayaker showed up and Patch headed across to Camano. I’m not sure if the whale did that because of the kayaker or if he was heading that direction anyway. I did not see how close the kayaker came to the whale.

Got just a quick look at a large [
gray
] whale’s tail coming out of the water this morning from the Washington State Ferry Klickatat. We were just beginning to depart the dock from Port Townsend at
8am
and the whale was approximately 300-400 yards in front of us in Port Townsend Bay. I kept an eye on the area until we were out of range but never saw it come back up.
