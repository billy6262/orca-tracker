Orca Sightings for March 1, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
we received a call Sun. night from Jesse Moss, a crab fisherman, with a report of ~15
orcas
off
Florence, OR
, heading north 3-4 miles offshore. He took photos which will be sent to the Ctr. for Whale Research, so hopefully we'll have some ID's on them soon.
*
We had a pod of 7
orcas
head slowly down Tumbo Channel tonight, starting at

5:30 p.m
. They came from the north and took about 1/2 hour to swim down the channel out to Boundary Pass. There was one large fin, two mediums and three small. Lots of splashing and slow travel. One of our sighters thought they may be transients because all the seals headed to the rocks.

Brad West of Port Townsend called at

11:25 am
to report a pod of 6 - 8
orcas
off Port Townsend, heading east toward Admiralty Inlet. He saw one male and one calf among them.

I headed out to look for the
orcas
- didn't find them until

12:45 pm
, they were at the south edge of Ft. Flagler State Park, on that side (of course!), heading SE, splashing & porpoising. I watched for an hour from Lagoon Pt, they were VERY spread out, so difficult to count - but there were at the very least 10 or 12, including a calf or two & a male. Not sure if it is J's or some of the Transients that have been around lately. I followed the whales as they continued south - at 2 pm they were passing by Bush Pt, some of them came closer to the Whidbey side, they seemed to be foraging & going back & forth some. At
2:25 pm they were spread out between the entrance to Hood Canal & Pt. no Pt, at
2:35 pm I watched a group of them feeding just off the entrance to Hood Canal, but the pod was generally still heading SE. By 3 pm they were south of Hood Canal, at
3:15 pm they were across from Mutiny Bay, heading SE in rough waters.
