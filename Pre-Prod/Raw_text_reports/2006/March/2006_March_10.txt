Orca Sightings for March 10, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out walking my dog about

8:30 pm
and distinctly heard a blow (off East Pt, WI, Saratoga Passage). It wasn't the short staccato of an Orca, it was definitely the longer, heavy blow of a
Gray
.
Windwalker
East Pt, Whidbey Island
*
We received a call from the crew of the Shelly Foss tugboat reporting a
gray
whale west of Gedney (also called Hat) Island, heading north at

3:25 pm
.
*
Marti Tilleyoff No. Pender island reported a pod of 12+
orcas
, heading north around Moat Pt toward either Salt Spring or Galiano Islands at

10:45 am
- there were 2 males & a couple of calves, sounds like it could be the K's & stray L's that have been down here.
