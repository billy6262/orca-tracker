whale just offshore in Edmonds today. Due to surface chop I only observed its blows but did so for about 2 hours from approximately
3p to 5p

It is about

11:20 a.m
. and I just came in from watching two
Grays
feeding just north of Whidbey Island in the Saratoga Passage. They moved along the shore toward Sandy Point and then headed out toward Possession Sound. A third Gray was in deeper water not far away from the feeding whales.

Bells Beach, NE of Langley - Two
grays
feeding, heading toward Langley. They were beyond the buoys, but they both looked big enough to be adults.
