Orca Sightings for March 31, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just now I heard two [
gray
] whales blow in the shallows below my house on East Point. What a gift to end the day with. It was obviously too dark to see anything, but I could hear them clearly.

Suzy Smith called at

4:45 pm
to report 3
grays
about 100 yds. off the Snakelum Pt. buoy, Penn Cove, Whidbey Island. They had been watching them travel east for about 20 minutes, then saw them take a deep dive.
*
The [
gray
] whales are now between Polnell Point on Whidbey & Rocky Point on Camano, headed northeast. Weâ€™ve been watching them for more than 35 minutes now (at

5:05 PM
), beginning 100 yards west of the Snakelum Point buoy and followed them out to where they are now. There are definitely 3 gray whales out there today. We saw 3 blows almost simultaneously and one blow was smaller than the other 2.

Received another call at from Warren at the Lewis & Clark interp. Ctr near the mouth of the Columbia River - 6
orcas
off the N. Jetty again at
11 am
, milling.....could be L pod again??! Talked to Brad Hansen on the NOAA ship - they were able to get more ID's confirmed of yesterday's whales & found there were also K pod whales present with the L's. The ship was on its way back in this morning, but another NOAA boat was in the area of the Columbia & was hoping to find the orcas & ID them.

Bells Beach (4 mi NE of Langley) Two, maybe 3
grays
feeding from just beyond the buoy line to farther out. Seemed like one was heading N, the other two were heading toward Camano. Or the one feeding closer & heading N had maybe joined up with the one feeding farther out.???Watched them for about 30 min.
