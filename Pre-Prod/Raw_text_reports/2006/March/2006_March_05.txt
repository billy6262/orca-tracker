Entry 1:
I saw two orcas cruising past Langley village, heading north. I watched them head north from the little outlook below the pub in Langley.

Just before sunset, we noticed that the large majority of the
pod
was headed straight for East Point! The main group of the pod which was moving South came right past us. There were 4-6 whales, mostly mid-sized with the exception of one BIG one, that passed right off East Point. They surfaced and blew less than 100 feet from where we were standing. You could hear and smell their breathing.

We headed to the bluff north of Greenbank at North Bluff just as the
orcas
were approaching from the south at ~
5 pm
. They were VERY spread out, from East Pt. to Cama Beach, all the way across Saratoga Passage, but mostly on the Camano side or mid-channel by the time we got out there. They turned around just north of Cama Beach & began heading south toward East Pt, with some of the whales doing zig-zagging back & forth, likely foragaing. By
5:45 pm they were fading out of sight in fading light, & all heading south off East Pt.

Windwalker Taibi of East Pt. called at

4:45 pm
to report
orcas
at East Pt. heading north. They saw 1 large male, a few smaller whales & a female & calf heading toward Holmes Harbor & North Bluff, & some off Camano Island State Park.

Neighbors alerted me about

4:00 PM
and I was able to get a glimpse of the first
gray whale
of the season, feeding, going north past Mabana(Camano).
