Mark "Mallard" Malleson has told me he passed on the info re residents this morning - Some updates:
J's K's and a number of L's

Craig Andies called in a report of ~20
orcas
near 3 Arches,
OR
at
noon
on Saturday - he reported there were some sea lions in the area as well, so it is likely this was a large pod of Transients?
*
A remarkable scene took place this afternoon. (Off Victoria, B.C.) A mum and calf
Humpback
started to breach, after a few jumps mum stopped. For a time period, the calf breeched 3-4 times a minute and carried on for a hour. This was between
1500-1600
, over a hundred+ breaches. Reports from shore based spotters and "Prince of Whales" boats.
Ron L. Bates, MMRG, Victoria
