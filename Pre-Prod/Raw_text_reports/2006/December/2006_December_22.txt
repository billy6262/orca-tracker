Orca Sightings for December 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
A couple came into my store in Hoodsport today who said they saw a
gray
whale while they were out kayaking in Hood Canal by the Alderbrook Inn! Could it be the one that was near Seabeck earlier this week?
Jeni Gray, Hoodsport, Hood Canal Mark from the Victoria Clipper called at

8:55 am
to report 10 - 12
orcas
milling off Double Bluff near the buoy, trending to the north.
*
John Herman spotted the orcas at

9:15 am
, between Double Bluff & Bush Pt, still closer to the Whidbey side & continuing north.

At
10 am
Elsa Leavitt saw the
orcas
just south of Bush Pt, heading north, about the time I arrived at Bush Pt. They were spread out, some closer in, & difficult to count in choppy waters. I managed to get a photo of the male, possibly K21 (Dave Ellifrit of the Ctr. for Whale Research agreed it looked like K21, & another male possibly L87, but not 100% confirmed), & watched until about
10:20 as they continued north. At
10:40 they were between Lagoon Pt & Ft. Flagler, doing some milling & direction changes, but generally continuing north. 11 am they were between Ft. Flagler & Ft. Worden, very spread out, mid-channel. At
11:15 they were just south of Pt. Townsend, off Indian Island, mostly heading north but again some milling & direction changes. I lost them for awhile, but found them again at

12:10
still off Indian Island & heading north.
