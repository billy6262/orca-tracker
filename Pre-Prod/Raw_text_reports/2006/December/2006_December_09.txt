Around

2:30 pm
right by Separation Point in Cowichan Bay next to Sansum Narrows I saw a large
Orca
jumping out of the water. We soon saw 6 of them....two very large adults...a large male and a large female two smaller ones and two younger ones, six in all. We have a 30 foot sailboat and we were right in close to the point and just edging into Sansum Narrows. We watched them playing, jumping, spy hopping, breaching for about twenty minutes with our motor off and our depth sounder off. Suddenly the two large whales started to swim directly toward us. It was rather frightening but they swam right under our boat on their sides looking at us and then went off to play some more. There were lots of sea lions and seals with fish in their mouths so we presumed the whales were fishing too? They went off toward Burial Island in Sansum Narrows going north. It was the most awesome experience I think I have ever had and no camera around.

This sounds like the pod of Transient orcas reported earlier in the day off Pender & Swartz Bay - ID'd as the T-40's. They were likely in the area hunting for the seals and sea lions!-sb
