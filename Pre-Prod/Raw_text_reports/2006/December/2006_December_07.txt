Orca Sightings for December 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Joy Weeks, relaying a report that MANY
orcas
were seen from the

12:30 pm
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry.
*
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries reported on their time with the
orcas
off west Whidbey. They met up with them at

12:15 pm
off Mutiny Bay & left them at Kingston, still heading south at
4 pm
. They observed much feeding behavior, including fish being clobbered by flukes, & orcas surfacing with fish in their mouths - that is always good to hear! They were able to collect some good samples, and confirmed they had part of K pod, no L12's present this time.
>From Candi Emmons of NOAA: Well here is who we saw. When we first got there we found a tight group of whales: K21, K40, K14, K26, K36, K16, K35, K12, and K37. At this time there were still a few whales to the north of us. As the whales headed south and spread out we only saw the K16s, K14s, K21, and K40.

There were whales (
orcas
) seen about 1/2 way across on the

3:05
ferry from Edmunds to Kingston. They were quite a ways from the ferry but appeared to be at least 3...1 had the big tall fin...heading North.

Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales, Victoria called to report finding some of
K pod
(less than half) plus L87, passing by Race Rocks, B.C. heading west at
3 pm
. This was surprising, as we thought we had K pod off Kingston at that time, which we did (half of them, anyway!)....apparently, the K's reported Thursday morning heading north past Bush Pt. at 9 am (including K20 & calf K38) DID keep heading north (K20 & K7 were among the ID's off Race Rocks). When we received the call of orcas heading south off Bush Pt. at
10:30 Thursday, we assumed the pod had turned around as they often do....teaches us not to assume anything about these whales! At least some of K pod did turn south, but the other half headed north...always interesting!
*
About half of Kpod went S.W. in the afternoon off Victoria ,also L87.
Ron L. Bates, MMRG, Victoria

Mark from the Victoria Clipper called at

9:05 am
to report ~8
orcas
, some ID'd as K pod whales including K20 & calf K38, 1.5 miles south of Bush Pt, milling & heading north slowly.
*
Elsa Leavitt reported the
orcas
just north of Bush Pt, now turned & heading south at about

10:30 am
.
*
After getting word of orcas off Bush Pt this morning, I hopped in the car & went out to find them. At

10:45 am
I found the
orcas
just north of Bush Pt, heading south, close to the Whidbey side, somewhat spread out. I watched from Bush Pt. until
11:15 as they rounded the point & continued south, further out into mid-passage. From

11:40 -
12:15 I watched as they continued south past Mutiny Bay, still mid-passage. The NOAA boat found the whales at about
12:10, & hopefully were able to obtain ID photos & more fish scale/fecal samples.

12:15 pm
