Orca Sightings for December 4, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
OK, so I maybe wrong but I think I saw a
whale
off the North End Ferry Dock, Vashon Island, at about
noon
today. It was heading north and was lingering on the surface or at least 20 minutes or so. It was not huge and had a large fin in the middle of it's back.

Two
Orca
, looking like female and juvenile, were traveling south in the center of the shipping lanes, first sighted by us at

8:40A
M off the end of Adams Road (just south of Bush Point). They went out of view a few minutes, but the Clipper was going very slowly around them with lots of folks on the observation deck, so we spotted them again, still just two.

While fishing off the beach at Bush Point at

9:15 AM
, I saw one large male
orca
and maybe a dozen females or juveniles due west off the beach. They were moving south and were spread over a distance of approximately 1.5 miles from south to north, from about 100 yards off shore to about 1 mile. They appeared to be feeding on salmon as they were traveling.
