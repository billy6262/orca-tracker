Orca Sightings for December 14, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Blows were spotted at

9:30 am
from our school windows at the Anacortes Home Education Partnership at the Walla Walla College Marine Station, Rosario Beach (Deception Pass, Fidalgo Isl). A solitary Whale, no dorsal fin visible, dark. Heading from south, past NW Island towards the north, it would surface and blow, hang out for a few seconds and submerge, never diving deep. If it was a
humpback or gray
, it's a young one. Quite thin from what I could see from shore.
