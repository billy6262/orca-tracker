Orca Sightings for December 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted two spouts of unknown origin in Crescent Bay while surfing. Both were seen very near the shore on the west side of the bay.

Just listened to the whales pass the Port Townsend hydrophone and it sounded like just
K pod
(

4:50 pm
).

I received a call of
orcas
off Port Townsend while I was on my way north up Whidbey Island, so I headed to the west side & stopped above Ebey's Landing to take a look. I didn't have my good binoculars, but finally saw several fins WAY over by the Port Townsend side, at about

3:50 pm
. They were still west of Port Townsend, heading toward Ft. Worden. They were too far away to get a count or any guess at ID's, but I called NOAA Fisheries & they were able to listen in to them on the hydrophone at PT!

We received a call at

3:40 pm
from Brad West of Port Townsend, reporting a pod of ~6+
orcas
about 1.5 miles offshore & west of Port Townsend, heading east toward Admiralty Inlet.
