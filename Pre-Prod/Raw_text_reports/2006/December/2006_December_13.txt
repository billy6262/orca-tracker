Orca Sightings for December 13, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
A small group of
orcas
out in the shipping lanes just went by us at about Bush Point, heading north. I counted 4 (1 close in, the others further out), but there were probably more, some sailors heading out may have send them under. that would have been about

2:10pm
.

After receiving Barbara's report, I headed over to the west side, hoping to find the
orcas
before dark. I found the orcas at about

3:50 pm
, just south of Ft. Flagler, way over on the Peninsula side. At first they appeared to be milling & feeding somewhat, but it was quickly apparent they were heading back South. I saw several tight groups of 4 - 5, & several smaller groups & individuals, I'd say approx. 20 whales present, with at least 1 adult male. They were so far away it was difficult to see them in the fading light, but I watched until about
4:15 & they were still heading south at a slow pace.
