Orca Sightings for December 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
David Bowen, a Whale Spoken Here volunteer, called to report 7 orcas off Simpson Reef, Coos Bay, OR heading south at
3:30 pm. There were several sea lions in the area, and the whales paid no attention to them, a good sign it could have been one of our resident pods.
