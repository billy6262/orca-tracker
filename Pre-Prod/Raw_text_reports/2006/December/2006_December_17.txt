Entry 1:
We received a call from Neil Falk of Hood Canal, reporting hearing a whale the night of the 17th. It sounded like a gray whale from his report & description.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called tonight to report they were able to get out with the
orcas
off Vashon today, meeting up with them at

off Pt. Robinson as they slowly traveled north, leaving them at
4:10 pm a few miles south of the Vashon/Fauntleroy ferry lanes, still heading north. They confirmed the ID's as K pod plus L87. They didn't observe any foraging, but were able to collect several fecal samples for their research.

We talked to Amy Carey of Vashon Island, she & Jeff & Amanda Hogan of Killer Whale Tales had been following a large pod of
orcas
along the shoreline of Vashon Island, and had ID'd K pod and likely some L pod whales present. At
