Orca Sightings for September 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Near Kellett Ledge we found a
minke
whale (possibly two) - then headed out to the south of Hein Bank where the I. Explorer II had found a small group of
transient
orcas. They made their way south toward Smith and Minor Islands. They came up on Minor Island and split up, some heading up the beach, some staying at the eastern point, working their way back and forth, closer and closer in to the beach. A couple of interesting behaviors I've never seen before, but heard of - a small group of whales "charged" the beach where the seals were hauled out, creating a huge wake that washed up over the beach! presumably to knock a few seals off into the water and create confusion..?? Also watched a female swimming sideways in close to shore, her dorsal fin hidden - then she popped up close to the seals and there was great commotion - lots of splashing and seals clamoring wildly to get up on the beach - I've never seen harbor seals gallop before, but believe me, they were galloping onto the beach!! It looked like there may have been numerous kills, lots of violent splashing going on at times. This group was apparently the T-100's, whom we've been seeing quite a bit of this summer! Large male with a kink at the top of his fin, couple females and a younger one - however, at the end of our visit, another large male showed up out of nowhere and not sure who he was!

We went to see some
transients
that were reported by Kelp Reef. There were about 10-12 animal in total, and they would split off in two groups.. get back together, and then split again. At first they were just traveling, nothing too much going on... we were getting ready to leave, when the whales started going nuts. We looked ahead of the whales, and there were Dall's porpoise that they had started chasing. The whales were in high pursuit, and they were jumping and chasing like crazy. It was really an amazing sight to see all the animals taking part in the kill. Several times a very young whale was in the lead, and they would frequently change off.
