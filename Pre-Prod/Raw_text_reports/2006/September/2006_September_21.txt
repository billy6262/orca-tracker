Orca Sightings for September 21, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Before we left we found out there were some down off of False Bay. We found out
all three pods
were scattered on the west side (San Juan Isl). The water was pretty choppy coming up from the south, but we eventually caught up with them. For the most part, we were with K22 (Seiku), K33 (Tika), and K41. For just more than a half an hour, all three were in major play mode. They were rolling around one another, and baby was getting a ride from mom on her back. The new calf also came with it's tail flukes straight out the water with a piece of bull kelp, and kept repeating that throughout the encounter. All three also were spyhopping so many times, I lost count. The little one was also spyhopping alongside mom and brother.

We live up just the road from you and my husband just saw what he described as most likely small whale with a black dorsal (
?Minke
) heading south on the east side of Whidbey. We are about 3 miles north of Greenbank.
