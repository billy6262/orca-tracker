10:30 am
- We just watched at least three and possibly four
Orcas
come by our Saratoga Passage cabin. They were headed south at a good fast clip! One animal had a very big dorsal fin! We live on Saratoga Road three miles north of Langley. These guys were right close by... would hit the Langley Boat Harbor if they didn't move out a ways.
