Orca Sightings for September 30, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report members of
J, K & L pods
off the west side of San Juan Island this morning. Dave Ellifrit & crew were out with them to obtain ID's.
*
We had the chance to be with
all 3 resident orca pods
as they traveled up Pender Island. The whales were quite spread out, with J-1 Ruffles leading the way. Lots of very tight groups traveling over a large distance, and one group seemed to be doing some mating as they passed somewhat distant to our stern. As we approached the north side of Stuart Island, we became surrounded with 6-12 Dall's. The words that best describe our encounter are: ballistic, enthusiastic, energetic.
