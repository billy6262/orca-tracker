Imagine my delight at seeing not one pod, but
all three resident pods
make their long awaited return to San Juan waters! J Pod was leading the way, and as the whales came across from Trial Island towards Lime Kiln, we witnessed dozens of spyhops. L Pod was directly behind them, and they were vocalizing so loudly that you could hear an echo as their vocalizations reverberated off the shoreline. As we watched the whales in a long procession slowly move up past Open Bay towards Kellett Bluff, we were also able to watch three research boats doing their studies--the "whale poop sniffing dog" team appeared to get several samples, as did the Cascadia Research team (who had a very close pass with L-57), and the Center for Whale Research as well. We also saw both babies in K-pod, with little K-41 doing really cute surfacings that were almost breach-like in nature. Towards the end of the trip, K Pod began doing extremely loud vocalizations as they passed Kellett Bluff heading north. Later around 8 PM on my drive home, it sounded like K's and L's were still vocalizing on the west side (as always when driving near the lighthouse I listen to the SeaSound array on 88.1 FM).

(See below)...We recovered the tag just in time to catch up with all the
southern residents
as they crossed over Haro Strait to San Juan Island, and spent a couple hours this afternoon trying to collect prey bits and fecal samples. We managed to collect salmon scales and bits from two different predation events by L57, and a fecal sample from L21 (which the genetics folks at NWFSC will use both to look for prey DNA and whale DNA).
