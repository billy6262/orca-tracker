We had a brief encounter with
transients
in Boundary Pass in the
evening
. It was pouring rain for most of it so we didn't get great photos, but whales present included at least the T20s, T100s, T101s, and T124s. We deployed another suction-cup attached time-depth recorder, this time on one of the T124s (one of T124C or T124D we think). Brad listened for the VHF signal from the top of Mt. Dallas last night and again this morning, and heard the tag off at 7 AM. We recovered the tag floating south of Victoria late this morning, and when we downloaded it this evening, found it stayed on for just over seven hours, coming off at almost 1 AM. This trip has been very productive, with a total of 42 hours of dive data from transients, almost doubling our sample from previous years. I don't know if I've mentioned but one of the bonus features of deploying these suction cup attached tags is that when skin sloughs off the whale some gets caught in a silicone grease we put on the suction cup, and we've been successful at getting sloughed skin from all four of the whales we've tagged this month. These skin samples go to the Northwest Fisheries Science Center genetics lab for contribution to studies of killer whale population structure, and they can also confirm the sex of the tagged whales genetically.
