Orca Sightings for September 27, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ed Bowlby & Barbara Blackey of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary called to relay reports from one of their boats near LaPush, WA - at 9 am, 2 male
orcas
were observed 1/2 mile offshore of James Island 47.53.85 N 124.39.45 W feeding (there were salmon in the area, the observers seemed to think they were feeding on the salmon, but it is more likely these were Transients??). Photos were taken and will be sent to the the Center for Whale Research for ID's.
