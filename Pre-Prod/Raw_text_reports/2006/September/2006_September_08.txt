Orca Sightings for September 8, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just an update on our monthly offshore survey...We finally made it out to Westport. Sighitng conditions were not great for much of the day. Offshore we had one large group of several hundred pacific white-sided dolphins, fast traveling to the south, and three
humpback
whales. We found two more humpbacks on our way back in, but all in all it was a pretty quiet day.

We were with the
transients
just north east of East Point. There were two groups as we arrived on scene at about
3pm
. One smaller group continued along north bound towards active pass, I'm not sure if they made it there or not. They were doing very long dives and moving pretty fast, so we broke off to see the other group that was headed more east. A Large group of T's. Not sure who was all there but T20 was there for sure. A large group of females and a young calf, I'm thinking it was the T100's.
