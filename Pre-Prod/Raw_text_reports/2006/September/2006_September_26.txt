Orca Sightings for September 26, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's early morning. I've seen 2-3 large groups of [
orcas
] slowly making their way up San Juan Channel. Very relaxing just watching them swim by, with one little guy doing a bunch of breaches near mom as they pass Low Island (San Juan County Park).
