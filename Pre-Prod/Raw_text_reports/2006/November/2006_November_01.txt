Orca Sightings for November 1, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
Northern residents
are being a bit ghost like at the moment. The A30s and the A12s just "disappeared" on the evening of
October 28th and we have not heard anything since! Other groups, the A36s and several G clan groups also vanished heading eastward in Johnstone Strait a few days before the 28th. However, there are still humpbacks around and some very growly Steller sealions certainly provided enough atmosphere for Hallowe'en.

: Very soon after writing to you the
A12s
and possibly the
A30s
as well have shown up in Johnstone Strait!

I heard on the VHF that
residents
were spotted at Race Rocks heading EAST towards San Juan Island.
