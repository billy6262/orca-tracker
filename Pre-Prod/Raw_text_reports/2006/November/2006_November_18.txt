Orca Sightings for November 18, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a family boating trip to Cape Sable, FL on the Gulf of Mexico side we observed 2
Killer Whales
. We were just outside of Big Sable Creek about .25 miles when we spotted the two orcas. Moments later a pod of approx. 5 Bottle Nose Dolphins appeared. The Dolphins appeared to be agitated. After a few minutes 1 killer whale reappeared and the a huge commotion occured. Instantly everything was gone; dolphins and orcas were gone. We fear that one of the dolphins was eaten. This occured during small craft conditions in about 11 feet of water. The time was
3:00 p.m.

We first saw the So. Resident
orcas
in Admiralty Inlet between Foulweather Bluff & Point No Point, closer to the peninsula side of the Inlet at around

9:30 am
. We went to Scatchet Head on S. Whidbey & watched as they continued south, doing some foraging behavior, breaches, tail lobs, & traveling VERY spread out between Point No Point & Apple Cove Pt, north of Kingston, from
10:15 am -
11:15 am. Some of the whales then began heading north, there was much milling, & finally they all had turned & were heading north slowly, still spread out over miles, whales everywhere we looked! We watched them head north until
11:50 am, observing 4 - 5 males & an estimated 40 - 60 whales, in an area of approximately 45 small fishing boats. NOAA Researchers were out with the whales to obtain ID shots & hopefully do some prey & fecal sampling, & had ID'd J, K & L pod whales present. At about
1:15 pm we took another look, & found the whales between Double Bluff & Point No Point, still heading north slowly, with lots of milling about. The researchers left the whales north of Double Bluff at 4 pm, heading north.

We sent a Zodiac out today at

1:00
and saw 5
humpbacks
and assume that there were a few others in the area, as there were 8 a couple days ago. There were at least 200 Steller Sea Lions at Race Rocks, 1 brown pelican, and a Peregrine Falcon on the lighthouse tower.
