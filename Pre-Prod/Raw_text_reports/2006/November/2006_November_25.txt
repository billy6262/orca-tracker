We had about 10
Transient
orcas just south of Trial Island heading NE this
afternoon
. There was what looked like a very young baby with them. I am sending photo's to Ken for ID's. Update: Ken just emailed me some of the ID's on the T's: T104 and T103 were present, along with T49B and her NEW calf T49B1.
