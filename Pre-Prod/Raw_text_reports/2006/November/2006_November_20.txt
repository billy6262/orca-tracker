Orca Sightings for November 20, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
While driving west across the Hood Canal Bridge yesterday
afternoon
, my partner was quite startled and delighted to see the cherubic mug of a single
orca
on the north side of the bridge, teeth glistening, eager maw agape, and happily snacking about in its watery buffet!

There was a
minke
logging on the surface just south of Deadman Bay, San Juan Island at

12:50 p.m
. First time I have seen that. It began moving slowly north. There were a lot of birds in the area a little farther north, so there may have been good feeding opportunities for the minke.
