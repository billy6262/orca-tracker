Orca Sightings for November 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just wanted to let you know that a single
orca
was sighted around
10am
about 100 yards offshore of the Bremerton ferry terminal heading in a north east direction. Did not spot him again. Salmon are migrating back to local streams so that may have brought him/her in.

As the (WSF) boat was sailing to Kingston, two
Orcas
breached simultaneously along side the ferry!
