Orca Sightings for November 11, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
The water off Victoria still has
Humpbacks
and others. 5 Humpbacks and 6
transients
. Among the transients were T49B and what would seem to be T49B1 a very young and colored calf. Mark Malleson "Mallard" was able to get some photos despite the heavy rain.
