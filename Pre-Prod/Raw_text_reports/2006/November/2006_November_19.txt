Orca Sightings for November 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found the
orcas
off Lagoon Pt. & watched them pass by heading NW from
3 -
3:30 pm
. There were whales spread out all the way across Admiralty Inlet, & they just kept coming - looked like all three pods again, this time heading out. I saw J1/Ruffles, & at least 3 - 4 other males, plus a young calf doing multiple breaches. We received reports from others at Lagoon Pt. that whales were still going by heading north at around
4:30 pm. Susan Berta, Orca Network, Whidbey Island

Spotted a pod of
orcas
at
0915
off Pt. No Pt. Sunday. I was heading south, they were going north. Approximately six with at least one large male. They seemed to be traveling, no playing or feeding.Very nasty day out there.
