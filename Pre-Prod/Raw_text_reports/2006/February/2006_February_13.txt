At approx.

6:30 pm
we received a call from Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales - he had their hydrophone out & was picking up chirps & blows coming from the south. He called a bit later to let us listen in to the calls as the
Transients
went by the north end of Vashon Island - way cool!

I saw what I'm assuming was the
pod
coming down from Vashon/Southworth this morning. They were just off our marina feeding (Tyee Marina in Tacoma) this afternoon at

1:30
. I just now got back from watching them from my kayak. After returning from the kayak, I watchED them from shore head across Commencment Bay towards the south end of Vashon. It looked like they were going to head north up Colvos Passage.

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called in updates on the pod of
transients
in Puget Sound today: at
11 am
, they were still heading south down the west side of Vashon, about mid-island at Lisabeula. At
11:40 am, they were off Pt. Defiance, swimming south FAST down into the Tacoma Narrows.
*
I didn't see this myself, but we have friends who are staying at our beach house on Colvos Passage, and they just emailed us at

11:15 am
saying there were
Orcas
off shore. Location was 1/2 mile north of Olalla Bay on the west side of Colvos Passage. They first spotted 2 whales blowing and traveling south together -- one with a vary large dorsal fin and the other quite a bit smaller. These two then headed east toward Vashon Island where they joined 4-6 additional orcas, and the whole group swam off to the south toward Gig Harbor.
