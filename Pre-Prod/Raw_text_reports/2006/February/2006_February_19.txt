Orca Sightings for February 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I were out to dinner in Tacoma, and we saw a
gray
whale come up, in Commencement Bay, outside of The Lobster Shop restaurant on Ruston Way. It was traveling north, around

5:00 pm
. It came up, blew air, went back down.
