Orca Sightings for February 14, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cameron Chandler called at about

1:45 pm
to report
orcas
off Pt. Partridge, NW Whidbey Island. He said there were approx. 9, maybe more, in several small groups, including a few males. They were heading north, & were about half way between Pt. Partridge & Hein Bank, heading toward the San Juans. He later sent this update: the wind picked up and it was whitecaps out by Smith & Minor Islands. I only saw a couple of dorsals, so either the pod split up or they were spending a lot of time underwater. At least part of the pod was making Easterly and going to pass Minor on the East side headed toward Orcas about
2:15PM Tuesday.

I saw a pod of
orcas
. I got a call around 10 am that said the orcas were just off Pt. Hudson. I went to several locations before I finally spotted them north of Point Wilson. They were far in the distance, but nonetheless, I saw spouts, black fins and black movement.

orcas
off the west side of San Juan Island this evening. A pod of 8 to 10 orcas cruised by slowly going north very close inshore off Hannah Heights at approximately

6:00 p.m
. There was one sub-adult male with a tall fin, but not as tall as a fully adult male. There were 2 young'uns that I saw and the rest were females or younger males. I don't know whether they were residents or transients. My guess would be transients, since they were breathing 4 to 5 times on the surface, then disappearing for about 2 to 4 minutes. They were travelling in a straight line, though. I followed them to Landbank. There they stalled out in the outgoing tide. They began to act more like residents, surfacing in the eddies at about the same place repeatedly. The male did at least one pec slap, but it was almost noiseless. They were about 1/4 mile offshore at Landbank. I left at around
6:30 p.m. because it was too dark to see much and I was freezing, but I could still hear them blowing.

When we got to the land bank property, we stopped to soak in the view, although it was about

6:15
and getting dark. I saw something quite large surface just off of the "eagle tree." Soon enough I could hear the beautiful sound of
Orca
blows. Wow, it has been at least 4 of not 5 months. We did manage to see some fins in the fading light. The whales were spread out, and we thought we could hear percussive behavior off Edwards point.

Tim Prince called in a report of a pod of 8-10
orcas
, including 2 males off Port Townsend at
9 am
. They were approx. 1 mile from shore, & traveled around Pt. Wilson heading NE. One of the males had a divet on the top trailing edge of its fin.
