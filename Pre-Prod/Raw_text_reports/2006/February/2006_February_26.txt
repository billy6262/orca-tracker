Orca Sightings for February 26, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a report from Jo Bradley, who has a small Bed & Breakfast in
Mendicino, CA
just south of Ft. Bragg. Some of her guests reported seeing a small pod of
orcas
. They reported one male, & a pod of ~3 orcas, staying in the area around the Mendicino Headlands Sunday afternoon.
*
Mitch Robinson called in a sighting of an
orca
off
Mendicino, CA
. They were watching for gray whales from shore with binocs & a spotting scope, & saw 1 male orca, with a ~3' high fin with 3 or 4 lumps on the backside of the fin. He was ~1000 yards off the coast, moving back & forth at the surface, looked like he was hunting. They said there may have been other orca fins out there, but they couldn't be sure. They watched for quite awhile, then the whale headed north toward Ft. Bragg in rough waters.
