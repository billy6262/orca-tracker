I went out with Island Adventures yesterday and we saw
all three resident pods
pass by in Rosario Straight, heading south, about

At Lime Kiln Lighthouse we had
Js and Ks
going north from

2:00
until about

6:15
, very spread out and usually not passing in groups of more than 2 or 3. The last whale to go north was a juvenile that looked too small to be on its own. It porpoised north, then 10 minutes later porpoised back south, still by itself. Hopefully there were other whales it was going back to join up with - we were hoping it won't end up being a repeat of the K31 (Tatoosh) story from last year.

Leigh Calvez of Bainbridge Island called to report a pod of
orcas
off the Bainbridge-Seattle ferry at

8:15 am
. They were south of Eagle Harbor, closer to the Bainbridge side, heading north. 1 male and at least 4 others - sounds like the Transient pod is heading north up Puget Sound.
*
Small pod of
orcas
with one male, one juvenile, and three or four females. Scooting north at good pace in Colvos Passage along west shoreline. Apx 1 mile south of the Southworth Ferry terminal at

06:30
. They stopped to check out the keel of our moored boat which awoke me to the sound of their blows.
