Orca Sightings for July 9, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

11:30am
, there were several
Orca
(and several boats (~20) watching them) off Hughes and Aleck Bay, Lopez. I saw one adult male with the group.

Working against a 2 knot ebb tide, two groups of
orcas
entered Active Pass via Georgeson Bay just after

6:30 PM
. Much tail slapping was accompanied by the occasional breach, with the first group being more playful than the followers.

Just a note to update
J and K's
progress up the islands. We picked up J's as they headed down Rosario at Davidson Rock. K's were south and moved in close to shore catching us in a pincher movement. We were able to get back outside after a slow, watching movement. Later in the day, we found them northbound up Haro Strait.
