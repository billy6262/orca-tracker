San Juan Island

As we approached East Point, the captain sighted
Orca
fins ahead. It was part of
J Pod
- just the J2 matriline and J1. These 6 whales continued travelling east in the Strait of Georgia and we left them a few miles off Point Roberts at approx.
5 PM
. Meanwhile, the rest of J Pod was apparently resting near Java Rocks, westbound. We observed a fair amount of activity - spyhops, breaches, tail slaps and cartwheels, accompanies by plenty of vocal activity on the hydrophone. On two occasions, we observed J14 spyhop and her calf, J40, porpoised past her chin. J30 was showing off alot, with lots of backswimming & pec flippers in the air.

This is a bit late but we spotted
Orcas
from the deck of our home on the west side of Tsawwassen. The whales were quite spread out, with some breeching, heading north from Point Roberts towards Roberts Bank.
