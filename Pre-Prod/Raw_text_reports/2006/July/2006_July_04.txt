Got a report from a fellow islander of a mother and juvenile
Humpback
off of vashon over the past couple of days, in Colovos passage.

We observed a whale on the west side of Vashon Island off Lisa Beula beach. I came later only to hear and see a brief skimming of the surface. Those that had been watching for about an hour said it was a
Humpback
.

There was a pod of about approximately 30
orcas
which slowly came by Saturna. We first got a call around

4:30
that they had rounded Monarch Head on the west and they passed by East Point after
5:00 p.m. heading north. Lots of mothers and young ones and a couple of very large males. Some were close in and others were further out in Boundary Pass and as others noted, quite spread out. The young were flipping and flopping and came close to the East Point rocks to check out two young girls who were there. We think they may have been L pod but are not certain.
