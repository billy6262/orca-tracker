1 pm

Around
4pm
we spotted a pod of
orca
whales. They were traveling south in Pickering Passage, west side of Harstine Island. We followed them, at a safe distance, until they reached the Harstine Island Bridge. I would estimate there were probably seven or eight in the pod with at lease one large finned whale. We were told the next day by our cabin neighbors (on Pickering Passage) that they thought they herd the pod that night heading back north.

On our
morning
trip we found
J - Pod
traveling along past Iceberg Point on Lopez about

11:15 a.m
. We were back out again for a 2 p.m. trip and once again headed south through Cattle Pass. We found
K's
this time off of False Bay at

3:00 p.m
. traveling north, and then, no, south, and then, no, north! There must have been some foraging and breaking up into different groups. Then more traveling, then more foraging. We were treated to a few cycle breaches, and a nice spy hop by a large adult. There were a few baby tail slaps in the distance. We had definite ID's on K-26, Lobo, and K-21, Cappucino. We heard there were J's along with some L's also present. The whales were very spread out from off shore, to the middle of Haro Strait.

We were out Crabbing in Taylor Bay today across from Johnson Point (NE of Olympia). We heard the Blow noises and saw a group of 5
Orcas
moving North West toward Case Inlet at

. After they passed Taylor Bay, we lost sight of them. Only 1 male spotted.

On the west side of San Juan Island near Land Bank, whales were passing by! We watched from

1:45 -
2:45 pm
as
J (& some of K?) pods
passed by heading north, then some went south again for a bit, then headed SW & disappeared for a bit. At

3:30 pm
, they came by heading north again, with several breaches, several calves - & we heard J8's breathing as she went by. at
4:08 pm they headed south, then back north, they were gone by
4:30. And again at

7:15 pm
