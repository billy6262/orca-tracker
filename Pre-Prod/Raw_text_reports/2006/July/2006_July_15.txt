Orca Sightings for July 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We also encountered a male and a female of the
L12 pod
- the female was too far away to id - first travelling south along San Juan Island and then heading out toward Hein Bank, all along very actively fishing.

Orcas (
J's, K's, and some L's
) having an absolute ball playing near Andrews Bay. I lost count of the number of breaches and spyhops. Tight groupings, lots of play behavior. Just whales, kelp, and my niece and I watching from shore. I heard on the radio they were in Active Pass around
4 PM
.
