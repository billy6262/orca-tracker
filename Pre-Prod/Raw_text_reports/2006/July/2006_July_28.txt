Orca Sightings for July 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
This
morning
,
J-Pod
went North! Then having had their trip north, J's came back down Georgia Strait and headed directly for Eastpoint. Not many boats on the water today, so most everyone was fairly spread out. The whales were porpoising as they approached the point, and when they were inside of Boiling Reef, we saw many breaches, tail slaps, and other percussives. The whales were bucking a pretty strong floodtide, but still were managing to make 3-5 knot headway. We left the whales still passing Eastpoint heading towards Turn Point.
