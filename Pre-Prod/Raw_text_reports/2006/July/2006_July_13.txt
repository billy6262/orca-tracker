Orca Sightings for July 13, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found
L's
about 3 miles off of the Cattle Point lighthouse, heading in no particular direction. Lots of percussives, lunges, and multiple changes of directions, followed by long (3 minute+) dives. Then they'd hang for extended periods at the surface, again non-directional. Lots of incredible vocalizations with so many distinct L-Pod calls. In the
afternoon
, we were treated to
J Pod
as they headed west past Iceberg towards Cattle Point. The whales were spread out, with J-1 Ruffles outside of most of the group. For the first time, I saw more than just a "sea snake", but actual mating just under the surface!!! I was so stunned I didn't get a picture until after they were "finished". It was J-28 Polaris, and not sure on this, but the male appeared to be J-33 Keet! I'm trying to get confirmation on this male ID, as I thought they didn't "practice" except with the older females. Anyway, it was a truly amazing display. Then unexpectedly, J-22 and her two offspring showed up out of nowhere and passed slowly off our bow. J-38 Cookie was in fine form, and had orange spots still under the chin (leftovers or perhaps a bit of the remaining orange tint?). When last we left the orcas, they were approaching Eagle Point with K's and L's heading down island to meet them. We spotted L-79 Skana heading right for the J's. Lots of vocalizations again, this time a mixture of J and L Pod calls.
