Orca Sightings for July 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I were out Friday
between 4 and 6 pm
enjoying the flat water and the beautiful day. We found a small group of [
orcas
], perhaps 10-12 near Eagle Cove, SJI, moving close along shore. Lots of fishing behavior. As they approached the Cattle Point area they went out further toward the green buoy, some fishing behaviors, but also several breaches and tail slaps. Whale boats all around and a couple not very aware of where all the whales were. We just drifted, and around 5 pm about 10 whales spent a good 30 minutes fishing all around us. One large male stayed at the surface a lot, breached twice, and then we hear him "speak." It was a magic moment. Quite a long vocalization. Shortly after that, the group headed toward the southern tip of Lopez. There were at least two calves, maybe three, each fishing with their mom. One was quite small, with a very cute-sounding little blow.

Received a call at

3:50 pm
from David, a fish counter for the state, who had just received 2 reports of
orcas
14 miles off LaPush at a 245 degree direction. One report was of 4 orcas, the other report was of 4 to 16 orcas. Ken Balcomb speculated it could be some of L pod.
