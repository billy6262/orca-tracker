Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to relay today's reports on the return of
K & L pods
. Astrid van Ginneken from the Center for Whale Research was on board, & confirmed the earlier reports of
L54 with a new calf, L108
(this calf was sighted during the DFO cruise off NW Vancouver Island on
May 8th), as well as
another new calf, apparently with K28
. Tom reported J's, K's & some of the L's off the west side of San Juan Island. Earlier they were at Iceberg Pt, Lopez Isl, by
2:15 pm they were off Eagle Pt & False Bay, just beginning to turn & head south again.

The majority of L-pod returned to the San Juan Islands for a brief visit
June 12 before returning toward the Pacific Ocean the next day. During the whales' short foray into the inland waters of Washington, staff at the Center for Whale Research were able to document
a new calf born to L-54
earlier in the spring. The new calf, designated
L-108
, is the second calf born to the 29 year-old L-54. At the same time that researchers were documenting the majority of L-pod, K-pod was traveling with a small sub-group of L's in Johnstone Strait. Following the
June 12 sighting of K-pod heading south into the Strait of Georgia, K-pod arrived in the San Juan Islands during the mid-morning of
June 14.
