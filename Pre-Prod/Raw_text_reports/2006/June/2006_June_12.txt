Orca Sightings for June 12, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I will try to do a brief synopsis of gray whale sightings off Chito Point during that period. My sightings have been limited due to my work schedule, however, a gray whale (I believe the same whale) has been observed feeding daily, spyhopping and even sleeping, in one specific area to the East of Chito Point, which is nearly seven miles west of Sekiu. This whale would remain in this one area for hours every day. I recorded on 6/12 - 6 hrs, 6/13 - 7 1/2 hrs., 6/14 - 3 1/2 hrs., 6/15 - 5 hrs., 6/16 - 3 hrs. These totals were from different sightings during those dates, however, the shortest feeding period was 2 hours, and the longest was 4 hours.
The long periods of feeding ended on 6/16 (from my observation log - remember I'm not always watching). Since then, I've logged the following sightings:
6/17 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West, 6 pm
6/18 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading East, 4 pm
6/19 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West, 6 pm
6/21 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West,
3:30 pm
6/22 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West,
6:30 pm
6/23 - Gray, outside kelp bed, heading West,
3:30 pm
During the days of long feeding periods, many times I thought this whale had a lighter colored head than body. It may be a large concentration of barnacles, however, this particular whale brought his head out of the water frequently on surfacing and spyhopping. The head always appeared lighter in color, consistently. On 6/19, the sighting at 6 pm of the Gray heading west, was this same whale, by the manner in which it surfaced, and binocular observation.

Entry 2:
We had a wonderful sighing of
L's
in the middle of the straits of Juan De Fuca. They were coming East from Discovery Island heading for Salmon bank but as I headed for home I could see that they had turned around East of Eagle Cove and headed back up San Juan Island. I left them at

20:00
as the sun was dropping behind the clouds above Vancouver Island.

Js
went through active pass
around 1
today and headed towards Point Roberts and went north towards the river. Looked like Blackberry was traveling with Suttles and was perhaps teaching her a thing or two about fish. Soon after, they b-lined it right to Shachi who was also feeding and chased a breaching salmon out of the water. We also heard on the way home around 4-5pm that Ls were headed in and were just west of Race Rocks.
