. - LOTs of breaches, cartwheels - very spread out, all the way from Lummi over to Orcas - nice afternoon show from the beach! J's been covering LOTS of territory lately and in unpredictable directions....looking for salmon and perhaps "pacing", waiting for K's and L's??

Ron Bates had some reports from people on shore of two
Transients
off Cormorant Point near Gordon Head on the lower Saanich Peninsula. This evening we headed south of Victoria hopeful to find Humpbacks. Around
1845
we encountered
Transient
Orcas
T-103 and T-104
. These SE AK Killer Whales were heading in the direction of Race Rocks. They were last seen near Rosedale Reef, just south of Great Race.

Update/ID's on So. Residents in Johnstone Strait: After reviewing his photos Jared Towers determined that all the K matrilines plus the L12s and L32s were travelling east in Johnstone Strait.

We had a rather exciting surprise today when some of the
southern residents
hurried south through Blackney Pass and into Johnstone Strait. They were silent and the first glimpse we had was very fleeting in the lifting fog but the Stubbs Island whale watch boat the Lukwa and Jared Towers had a closer look and were able to determine that it was the Ks and some of the Ls. Jared is reviewing his ID pictures and will have more details later. When last seen they had slowed down and were resting east of the Robson Bight Michael Bigg Ecological Reserve but still pointing eastward.

Just came back from a visit with
Jpod
out in the Strait just south of Point Roberts, heading South, they were very spread out and steadily travelling south, with a few breaches, taillobs, a couple of barrel rolls, and what looked to be occasional foraging. Didn't get a real close look at anyone, except for J8 who travelled parallel to us for a bit, and J19 with J41 who is getting huge!

Js
north of Orcas headed south today. They were very spread out across Alden Bank feeding and got very active after a while. They seemed to be traveling in small, abrupt family groups and we watched Blossom breach 9 times in a row!
