Orca Sightings for June 23, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted a few spouts of an identified
whale
(s) from the black ball ferry after leaving Victoria on Friday afternoon. The location was 1/3 in the strait on the Canadian side.

I do not understand the lack of
Lpod
Reports with the
J's
. I had them this morning off Colville Island at
1015
and near Stuart Island at
1535
. No other whale looks like L57 and he was there, we are still missing some of Lpod.

We heard that
J's & L's
were heading up the west side of San Juan Island, but as we watched the whales pass by near Pender Island around

3:00 PM
, we only saw J's. As they came across Boundary Pass and headed into Swanson Channel, they began to gather closer to shore. Lots of percussives and breaches by the juveniles as they continued North.

We found
J Pod
today, headed north from Stuart lighthouse, Turn Point, across Boundary Pass....going toward N. Pender Island at

3:15 p.m.
J-1 Ruffles, and J-2 Granny at the head of the group, swimming steadily north. Then as they got near North Pender island they slowed, and continued up the shore. J-8 passed by, J-26, and far inshore, many more.
