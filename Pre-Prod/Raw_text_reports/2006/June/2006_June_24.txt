============================================================

Entry 1:
June 20 & 24 - Richard Niemar called to report two sightings of a single
orca
(non-adult male) off Baja - the first sighting was
June 20th at Cabo Pomo, the 2nd report was
June 24th at Punta Arena.

We met up with
Jpod
and some
L's
in heading North in Rosario Strait just off Lummi Island. Thought we had only Jpod first, but thought some L's were in there and have a posititve ID for L57 Faith. I got my pics on Flickr if anyone is interested. http://www.flickr.com/photos/wildorcas/. The whales treated us to multiple spyhops, breaches, cartwheeling and some amazing tail lobs and a wonderful symphonie. They were still headed North as we left them at about
4.30 pm
or so.

[
Orcas
] on the west side of San Juan Island passing Low Island about

3:30 PM
. There were whales over in Rosario as well. Not sure what group was out today as they were a bit too far to ID, but they apparently didn't go far to the north as we had more whales (same guys?) passing the house about

6:00 PM
heading back south!

We were out on 2 trips today with 2 different groups of [
orcas
]. Our AM trip had us catching up to the trailers of
L Pod
as they headed from Alden Bank towards Rosario Pass. They were travelling leisurely with great vocals. One youngster treated us to a couple of back to back breaches. As we were preparing to leave, the group must have received some signal that they were lagging behind, as they started porpoising away, Southbound.
For the PM trip, we had received an update that the whales in Rosario Pass were headed back Northbound. We anticipated seeing L Pod whales again, but this time it was
J Pod
headed our way. We first met up with J1 & J2, with the rest far behind. A few tail slaps from Granny later, and the rest of the pod was soon sighted heading North from the vicinity of Lummi Island. Again, they were quite spread out, but were in fine voice. We had a great show from several whales, but in particular J26. He seemed intent on showing off multiple behaviors - breaches, tail slaps, pec slaps, and a cartwheel or two. Meanwhile, another whale further in the distance was practising spy hops - 3 in a row! We left J Pod headed Northbound towards Point Roberts at approx

4:30 PM
.

At

3:30
today, we saw a large number of
Orcas
swimming north quite close to Lummi Island when we were there to eat lunch at the Willows Inn, which looks out over the water. Many others were seeing them also, many other onlookers had binoculars, and were certain they were the orcas.
