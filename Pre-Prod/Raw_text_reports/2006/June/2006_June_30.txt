Orca Sightings for June 30, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson called to report that he & Candi Emmons had found the pod of
Transient orcas
off Vashon Island Friday evening - they saw 5 of the 6 that were present in the pod earlier in the week (apparently there were 2 males present in earlier sightings, but 1 of the males was being stealthy.....). They left them off south Vashon Island, heading south.

Early this morning we had
J's & L's
in mid-channel of Haro Strait.
K's
were still up north after they left yesterday afternoon. Later in the day, they were still at Andrews Bay. But when we came on scene in the afternoon, we only saw L's on the west side. Later, around

3:00
, we heard that another boat had discovered what he believed to be J-Pod up near Java Rocks in Boundary Pass. They must have given everyone the slip when L's decided to head South. Near False Bay, we had a wonderful float watching the L's forage for salmon---and they were really vocalizing in the process. L-41 Mega was doing long dives, and gave us quite a start by coming up when no one knew he was even around! We left the whales still heading slowly towards Cattle Point, spread out in a path about 3 miles long and 1-2 miles wide.
