J-Pod
foraged near Cherry Point. Whales were very spread out, but it was nice to get a good viewing of J1, J2, J8, J19 with J-41. At one point it appeared that J41 was traveling with another small juvenile. Lots of breaches, tail slaps and small bursts of speed swimming (porpoising) heading south towards Bellingham Channel.
