L57
has been hanging around with
J pod
the last few days, and it looks to us like a "dating opportunity" as one of our passengers so aptly put it. We have observed him in close company with a few females, and much rolling around behaviors, both male and female - and the summer "sea snake" has also been observed on a few occasions. We may even have pictures to prove it. We had what looked kind of like a "group grope" this morning on our trip, with L57, a couple of females, and a couple of youngsters. The young ones spyhopped a few times. Then they joined up with the rest of J pod who were approaching in resting formation.....verrry interesting....

J's
with
L57
"sleeping" at Open Bay as of
11am
. The first report of them at Open Bay was received around 9am, so it seems they hung out there for quite some time.
