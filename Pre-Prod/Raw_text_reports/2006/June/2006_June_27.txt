J's
with
L57
spread out along the west side of San Juan Island (south of Lime Kiln) this
morning/noon
. L57 was hanging out with a few females inshore and east of the rest; very active foraging, and a few rather amorous moments.

Once again,
L-57
was still traveling with the females of
J-Pod
as they headed up mid-channel of Haro Strait towards Turn Point at

3:00 PM
. Today he was sighted in close company with J-28 Polaris, who is herself coming "of age". There were several other females as well traveling near him too. J-1 Ruffles was traveling by himself when he passed by, with J-2 Granny not too terrible far behind. J-22 Oreo was traveling with her youngsters, Oreo and Doublestuff off to the east of the main group as well.
