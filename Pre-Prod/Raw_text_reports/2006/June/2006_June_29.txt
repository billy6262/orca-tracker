June 28/29 - A report from Southern California three miles offshore of Dana Point. We've had seven
Blue whales
for the last two days. Water temp has been fluctuating between 59 degrees to 70 degrees and now back to 59 degrees in the last ten days. The Blues are adults ranging from seventy to one hundred feet. Lots of huge flukes in the air and much reddish excrement in the water, so apparently they are feeding. Four to seven blows, then down for six to ten minutes. Spouts of fifteen feet or more. We are going out daily and hope they stay for a while. Yesterday (6/29) we also had common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and Risso's dolphins all in the same general area.

Whales, Touching the Mystery

I am always in awe of the beauty and peacefulness of these wonderful (
Orca
whales) when we encounter them on our trips. We left the dock today with
J pod
at Colville coming West and
L pod
milling near Lime Kiln, where they had been since this morning. We ended up finding J pod off of Iceberg Point, where they had slowed down and were doing some foraging. We got a wonderful look at J19 and J41, as well as J1, L57 and others. We watched for a while as they glided by us through the calm water. We were just getting ready to start heading back to Friday Harbor when I heard a boat with L pod say they were porpoising towards us from off Eagle Point. Just at about the same time I noticed the whales we were watching begin to porpoise towards L pod. We traveled offshore of J pod until they reached Salmon Bank. Then the L pod fins started appearing from the other direction as we were treated to a couple of great breaches. I set up, with a couple of other boats, offshore of the whales at about 300 yards, shut down, and put the hydrophone in. The symphony of vocalizations were spectacular. Their level of communication always amazes me. We started to see them group up; 5 whales, 10 whales, 20 whales at a time and then split off into smaller groups, only to come back together, going every direction. Before we could relocate, we found ourselves with whales all around us. They were everywhere, frolicking in tight groups of 10 to 15 whales. I try not to apply human emotions to these beautiful animals. But I have to say that they just seemed so happy, peaceful, and affectionate towards each other. We had been with them for about 15 minutes or so when the flood tide began sucking us and another boat (Olympus) towards Cattle Pass. Every time I was getting ready to start my engines whales would pop up nearby, still socializing with each other. Next thing I know Olympus and I are drifting through Cattle Pass at 5.5 Kts and the whales are staying right with us. It was amazing to see them so effortlessly navigate through the roaring current as we bobbed and spun like corks on the surface. Finally, about 2 miles up San Juan Channel the whales started to group up in the middle and we started to drift to the East side. As I brought the boat around and headed home we could still see them breaching and socializing, as if they hadn't a care in the world. These animals are truly special. Lets all keep doing all that we can to protect their environment and keep them around for a long time to come.

Orcas
seemed to be all over the straits today! I was kayaking near Swirl Island and about 12 went by me there, 2 adult males, several females and one very small one. They were heading towards the south west at a good pace, no breaching or other action just cruising. There seemed to be plenty more (from what I could see and hear) to the west and south in the straits, along with several boats, also scattered.

Today we had the good fortune to have
ALL 3 Pods
in San Juan waters! This morning, a majority of K's and L's were hanging out in the currents near Lime Kiln. They were foraging, breaching, and generally moving in random patterns. Later in the day, K Pod decided to head "up island" and went towards Turn Point Lighthouse and beyond, while the L's continued to forage, rest, and play at Lime Kiln. As we left the dock, a report of J's coming down Rosario got the crew excited, but with J's pretty far in Rosario and L's reported to be heading North, we weren't too expectant of the two meeting up. I got the chance to witness first-hand my very first
Greeting Ceremony!
As if practicing for the J's that were coming from Iceberg towards Cattle Point, a large group of L's broke into two groups, and began staying on the surface in two distinct lines. They slowly moved towards each other, and the vocalizations underwater were astounding. But if you didn't have a hydrophone, it didn't matter, for when the whales got about 10-15 yards from each other, the surface vocalizations became amazing. I was truly humbled by this incredible display. Then the whales dove down, and we couldn't figure out where they went until they decided to show off and do some incredible breaching--males coming fully out of the water! Then most of the group high-tailed it easterly to greet the J's that were now almost to the entrance of Cattle Pass.

Our first trip took us to the west side of San Juan Island near Lime Kiln State Park at about
2-3pm
.
L pod and K pod
were all together putting on quite a scene. Breaches, spyhops, tail-lobs. Our second trip was even better...
all 3 pods
were making their way up San Juan Channel as we left Friday Harbor. In the south part of Griffin Bay, all 3 pods were spread out everywhere with a similar scene. Breaching, spy hops, and tons of tail slaps. We saw some mating as well.. lots of dual tail action going on. We even saw a few sea snakes!
