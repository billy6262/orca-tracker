About

2:30 -
4:30... J pod
...alot of surface behavior... tail/pec slaps... 2 or 3 breaches...some logging maybe... they were just laying on the surface for a minute or two now and then... I think I even heard a above water vocalization when one was poking his head up... not really a true spyhop though... maybe it was bubbles? Sounded like gurgling though....? They were spread out alot... the leader was probably almost to South Beach area by the time the last group came around by Eagle. Boats were saying that J1 was WAY out.

I have a sighting to report, witnessed by four adults. We were too stunned by what we were seeing to get the camera and take it's picture at approximately

4:30 p.m
. One
orca
, probably male, with a large, tall, upright fin. Yachats,
Oregon
, just south of the mouth of the Yachats River, halfway between Newport and Florence. He was not very far offshore, about the same distance out as the gray whales that we see. The whale was traveling south at a pretty good speed. We saw him breach twice, then he disappeared for a few minutes, and reappeared south of us, where he breached several more times, and continued to travel south.
