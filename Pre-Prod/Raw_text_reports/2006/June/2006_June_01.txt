We spent the afternoon with
J-Pod
once again! Today they were headed south in Rosario at

1:00 p.m
. with once again very relaxed traveling behavior, and occasional quick turns and dives. They were very spread out, with J-1 way across the strait. Both J-27 and J-26 were showing off their sprouting (and tall!) dorsals. J-1 gave us the pleasure of a slow spy hop. Wow! By
2:40 they were starting to turn on a little steam, and grouping up heading for the south end of Lopez Island. The water was very flat today, with lots of low clouds, mist, and fog in the distance. Magical.

in the bay today, for the 3rd day in a row. On
May 30, the orcas were actively feeding, but not on the gray whales that were nearby.
