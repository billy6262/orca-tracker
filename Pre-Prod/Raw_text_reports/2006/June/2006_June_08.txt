Entry 1:
We left
Js

Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters
San Juan Island

I listened to reports of two small groups of
transients
off the west side of San Juan Island
most of the day
. Apparently very interesting viewing, as some type of marine mammal hopped up on the swim step of one of the boats. The transients came right up to the boat with heads high, and peered at the hoped-for prey repeatedly. I did not get to see any of this. I did get to see half of
J pod
parade south along the west side of the island off Hannah Heights this evening at about

7:00 pm to
8:15 pm
. They were widely spread, in single file, except for J19 and J41 who were together. I also was able to identify J26, J33, J36, J2, J8, and probably J16.

Transients
kill a harbor seal in San Juan channel between Lopez Is and Griffin Bay. Approx 1 mile North of cattle pass. at

12:30-
1:30
. A harbor seal looked like it was going to haul out on the stern of the Odyssey. It was 10 feet from the boat as the 4 transients started a symmetrical weaving pattern. Back and forth crossing paths closer and closer to our stern. 35 eight graders from TOPS school in Seattle witnessed the wild kingdom in action when the T,s surrounded the seal 20 feet off our port stern. The mature female tail slapped and then juvenile did a rather feeble tail slap and they repeated tail slap practice for some time. When ever the seal started to swim away another of the larger T,s flicked it with their snout to toss it back in the middle of the circle. The T,s carried on like this for 20 minutes. Then they submerged with the seal and resurfaced minutes later and the seal was gone. The T's crossed back and forth under the boat 4 or 5 times, visible through the water, spouting several times each. They spy hoped twice off the bow and then continued a straight swim south towards Goose Is. in cattle pass off the S. end of San Juan Is.
