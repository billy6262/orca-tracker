Orca Sightings for October 8, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod
showed up at the south end of San Juan Island, west of Salmon Bank buoy. We arrived at

1:00 p.m.
to find the whales foraging in sub pod groups. I noted J-27, J-26, J-19 and J-41, along with J-1 in the distance. The whales stayed with the foraging, and finally about
2:30 they started grouping up and traveling north along San Juan Island's west side.

J pod
has been doing the west side shuffle off San Juan Island. They were seen early in the
morning
at Hannah Heights. They then headed south and were spread out foraging for much of day from the Eagle Point area to Salmon Bank, with lots of play activity, from what I could see. They moved north in the afternoon, went to Andrews Bay (probably to peek at the Free Corky banner being unfurled), then turned south. Half the pod came in very close at Lime Kiln and one of the whales, I think J26 or J27, did a giant spyhop maybe 10 yards off shore. The whale looked huge up close and personal. I watched them above Hannah Heights at a seeming standstill, except for the ebb tide, until
7 pm
.
