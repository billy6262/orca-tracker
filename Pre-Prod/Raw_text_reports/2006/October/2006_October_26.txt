Orca Sightings for October 26, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
minke
whale, about 150m (yes, that is meters!) west of Bodega Head, Bodega Bay, CA. a single individual, moving south. the proximity to shore, even on the outer coast is not unexpected. south of here, between monterey bay and big sur, they are seen at the edge of kelp beds.
