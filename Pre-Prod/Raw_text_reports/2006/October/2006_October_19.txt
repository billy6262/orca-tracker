Orca Sightings for October 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

5:30 pm
we saw [
orcas
] come from the south corner of North Pender, east past Brooks Point - South Pender (were we were) and then they continued east towards the southern tip of Saturna Island. About 25 of them passed by Brook's Point - 25' from shore, and it looked like they were feeding and frolicking (many jumps, spy hops, circling, swimming through Kelp). 1 youngster was amongst this group and porpoised for us. Another 12 or so passed by about 500 yards from shore as well.

Ken Balcomb reported the Center for Whale Research was with
K & L pods
as they traveled north past the west side of San Juan Island, leaving them at about
4 pm
. They had later reports of them in Boundary Pass, near Blunden Island at
6 pm
.

Jason Wood of Beam Reach called to report the
orcas
had reached San Juan Island at

12:50 pm
. They were with them 1 1/2 miles south of Eagle Pt, west San Juan Island, & had positively ID'd some K pod whales & were in the process of ID'ing others.

Well, looks like
K's and L's
are making another visit to San Juan Island today! Very tight groups passing by and between several commercial fishing boats near San Juan County Park. A few stopped and appeared to be checking the nets for fish. They continued on Northward.

to report a pod of orcas 1/2 mile offshore at Pt. Partridge, NW Whidbey Island. They were moving slowly to the north in the fog. The Center for Whale Research & Beam Reach hope to meet up with them (
likely K's & L's heading out - sb
