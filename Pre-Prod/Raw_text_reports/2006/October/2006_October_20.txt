Orca Sightings for October 20, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Your report says no reports of whales on the 20th but no time of report. I only did one trip but had
Jpod
off Hannah Hts. at
1440
. They were reported in the am coming from the South West. At least 6 humpbacks off Victoria all day and have been there for almost a month.
