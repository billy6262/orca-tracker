============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported
J pod
in Haro Strait at
4 pm
, off Hannah Heights heading south.
*
I spotted what looked like a young
gray
whale just off the north shore of Alki Point this
morning
from the bus. One of my fellow commuters said he had seen a larger one earlier and thought there were more than just mother and calf, but I didn't see any others during the time I was watching. I saw the calf surface once, heading east toward Duwamish Head.
