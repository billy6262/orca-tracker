============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report

1:44 pm
.

I was just out watching them, coming from the Lime Kiln Lighthouse heading south at

2:30 to 3 PM
. I can hear lots of tail slaps and blowing from the ones close to shore, and there are others just cruising and scattered out even beyond five or six whale watch boats sitting 1/4 mile from shore.

J pod
has been doing the west side shuffle off San Juan Island again. They appeared at Kellett Bluff at around

1:00 p.m.
, heading south. They were foraging quite actively off Land Bank, complete with gulls circling for tidbits. Again the J's shuffled between Pile Point, Lime Kiln and Pile Point. I left them at Land Bank, heading for Edwards and parts further south at about
7 p.m.
this evening.
