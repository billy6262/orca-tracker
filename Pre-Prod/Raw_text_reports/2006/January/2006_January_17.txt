Orca Sightings for January 17, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky enough to see a pod of
orcas
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca from the RR (Race Rocks) cam (
1127
). A male with a tall dorsal and what looked like three or four female and/or juveniles. They were headed towards Victoria in a calm sea and clear light. I managed a few distant "captures" and you can see them at : http://snipurl.com/lnwa last seven photos

The pics say the
whales
were off Race Rocks around
1127
. I heard
transients
occasionally calling and often percussive slapping between 2330 17 Jan and 0030 18 Jan in Haro Strait. I got the distinct sense that some marine mammal was getting thrashed! As best I could tell, they went north in Haro Strait by 0100 18 Jan.
