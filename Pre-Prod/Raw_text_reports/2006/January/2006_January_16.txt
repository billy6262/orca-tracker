Orca Sightings for January 16, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on the
4PM
ferry leaving Mukilteo and arriving in Clinton when I noticed
Orca
whales off to the right (North of the Clinton ferry dock) They were so close, once I exited the ferry I pulled off to the side and watched them for awhile from the ferry deck. There were four males and one very small baby, and the baby was having a great time jumping out of the water.

Veronica von Allworden called at

3:15 pm
to report 6
orcas
passing Langley heading SE down Saratoga Passage. She said they were nearly mid-channel, a little closer to the Whidbey side, & traveling in a tight group.

1500
we just watched 3, maybe 4
Orca
going toward Langley, in the Saratoga Passage from here (Bell's Beach, north of Langley). They spent about 30 min "fishing"? They were busy diving together and staying close together. They'd dive in one area, with a lot of surfacing for about 10 to 15 min, then dive and be absent for another 10 min before someone would spot them quit a distance from the last spot, then they dive at that spot for a good 10 plus minutes and move on. No spy hopping. Our neighbor said they were as close as the orange buoys! When I saw them, they were another 100 feet out.

A member of the crew on the Port Townsend/Keystone ferry reported seeing a
gray
whale mid-channel on the run before we got on, ~ at
noon
. No direction indicated. A passenger onboard the ferry at ~
4:15 pm said he thought he saw an orca, but by the time he alerted us we were some distance away & it was rough waters & nearly dark, so no confirmation on that one.
