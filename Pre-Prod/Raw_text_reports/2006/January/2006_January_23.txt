============================================================

Entry 1:
Ranger Natalie Lohee (sp) from Mendecino State Park called at

11:30 am
to relay a report from a camp host, 3 miles north of Westport beach, at Westport Union Landing State Park, CA. A minimum of 6
orcas
were seen close to a
gray
whale who possibly had a calf - it looked like they were attempting a kill.
