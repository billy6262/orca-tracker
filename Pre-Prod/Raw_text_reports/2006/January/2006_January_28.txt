Orca Sightings for January 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky enough to witness 5
Orcas
in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, by Anacapa Island!! (off the coast of Ventura, CA) at
2 p.m.
. I was told they were feasting on a harbor seal. There were a lot of birds dropping in for the remnants. We could hear the whales as they exhaled. They spy-hopped, breached, and wagged their flukes in the air. It was a wonderful show. I heard someone say that they thought it looked like one male and the rest females. I had been out on the morning boat looking for gray whales and although we saw Risso's Dolphin and a megapod of over a thousand Common Dolphin popping out of the ocean as far as the eye could see, we saw no gray whales. I decided to go out again on the afternoon boat just to see what I could see and was rewarded with this magnificent sight of the Orcas! I guess that may be why we saw no gray whales in the vicinity earlier!
