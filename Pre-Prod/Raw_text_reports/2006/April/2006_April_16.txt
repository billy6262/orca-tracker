Transients
off Victoria. Three whales for sure, 5 reported at one time. T14, T93 and Mallard says possibly T88, I am not sure on that one. Whales were picked up just West of Race Rocks and made there way to the North East all afternoon. At least 2 kills but small amounts of flesh etc. would indicate seals. We left them heading East towards Clover Pt. off Victoria at
1645
.
