Fourth
Gray
Whale sighting of the day at

8:00 pm
. I wondered if it was the same whale that had been sighted and reported at
3:30 pm between the Sekiu River and Chito Point, as it was in the same general area.

At
1 PM
, we saw
J-Pod
foraging in a zig-zag pattern in a Southwesterly direction near Middle Bank. Soon a small group that we think included J22 Oreo and her two calves Doublestuff and Cookie began to get quite active. It must have been contagious as we saw 3-4 breaches, dozens of tail and pectoral percussives, tail lobs, cartwheels, and 7 spy hops! Everyone (this naturalist included) were quite excited to get to see almost every behavior we could in such a short period. Later we heard that J's had turned towards San Juan Island, and were spotted heading north past the Land Bank property towards Lime Kiln.

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called to repot
J pod
today - they had headed north up the west side of San Juan Island, & at
6 pm
were at Henry Island, where they turned & headed south back down the west side of San Juan Isl. They were in 2 groups, not too spread out, & the sprouters were getting frisky!
*
Hung out with
J Pod
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon; they were a bit west of Hein Bank at around
1pm
. Lots of breaching, tail-lobbing, cartwheeling and spyhopping. I'll send a lo-res your way once I get my pictures processed...

Karen and I were standing on the jetty at the mouth of Grays Harbor this morning. One or two
gray
whales were feeding about 200 yards off the jetty. They were spouting away in the sunshine.
