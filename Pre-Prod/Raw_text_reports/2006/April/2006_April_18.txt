Windwalker Taibi of East Pt, Whidbey Island called at

7:20 pm
to report more Dall's porpoise than he could count, in Saratoga Passage. They were 1/2 mile off East Pt. & all the way across to Camano Island, circling & feeding everywhere.

Returning from Seattle on the

2:30
(Mukilteo/Clinton) ferry, we saw a telltale spray, followed by a perfect fluke. Looked like a good-sized [
gray
] whale, diving at the far east end of Columbia Beach, just outside the ferry lanes. Smart whale. Then when we drove into Langley about
2:50 we saw more spray in Saratoga Passage... seemed to heading toward the east. Couldn't tell how many, but pleasure boats in the area were getting a peek.

I've just returned from Hidden Beach off of North Bluff Road on Whidbey Island. I had the great pleasure to observe 2
Grey
Whales feeding close to shore, and one further off, from about

9:30 to
10:30 a.m
. They spent most of the time feeding on the ghost shrimp beds, on their sides, plowing through the bottom with the downside fluke propelled by their tails which were swishing around vigorously. Then they would seem to pause, with the upside fin dropping slowly. The lateral portion of their torso would be exposed frequently, as the water did not seem to be too deep. At about
10:30, the two I had been watching along the shore moved off towards the center of Saratoga Passage.
