Orca Sightings for April 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Gray that has been hanging out in Agate Passage lazed around all evening - about halfway between the Agate Pass Bridge and the Suquamish Pier. It has apparently been in the area for several days. (
from information we've received, we believe this whale has been in that area since ~
March 31 - sb
)

Alan and I watched two (?)
Grays
feeding along the shore just west of Sandy Point in the Saratoga Passage. It was after the sun had set so we were only able to see tails and blows silhouetted on the water surface. Lots of blows so there may have been more than two. We could still hear them after we couldn't see them anymore.

Great to see
Jpod
today, it was interesting this afternoon as J1 was miles from the rest of them. He did look good, last seen heading S.S.W. towards Port Angles at
1640

J pod
arrived off the west side. I watched them going south from Lime Kiln to Landbank to Hannah Heights from

11:30 a.m
. to about
1:30 p.m. Lots of foraging going on. A whale that looked suspiciously like J2 (Granny) was leading the inshore orcas, followed by a whale that looked suspiciously like J8 (Spieden). J19 and J41 were definitely inshore while I was watching. J41 seems to have grown a lot and was expending much energy bouncing off J19's blowhole, or tail-slapping her as she attempted to forage. That little whale seems quite healthy. J17, J26 and J27 were also inshore, as were about 15 members of the pod. J1 was out in the middle of Haro Strait with about 5 others, and was attracting lots of attention from whale watch boats. After passing Pile Point, the inshore orcas headed off shore towards Salmon and Hein Bank. Unfortunately, by 5 p.m. J1 was pretty far west, according to the position of the whale watch boats. Hope J pod doesn't go back out.

I We sighted the first
Orcas
of J Pod for the year on Sea Hawk of San Juan Safaris today off Hein Bank. There were maybe 10 animals spread out over approximately 5 square miles. They appeared to be feeding and had no destination in mind. There were several other boats in the area from both the mainland and Canada.
