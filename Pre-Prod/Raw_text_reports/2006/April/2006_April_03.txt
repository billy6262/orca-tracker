There were three
grey
whales off Witter Beach, south of Sandy Point (Saratoga Psg, so. of Langley) at
7'ish a.m
. They are feeding in the cove just south of us now. They have been around off and on quite a bit the past week but I haven't had time to send an email. We have whale holes again littering our beach!
