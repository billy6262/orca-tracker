Orca Sightings for April 8, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Steve Jeffries passed along an orca sighting from off the Columbia River mouth - 6 - 8
orcas
, including 1 large male were sighted by Bruce Pyrah & Evonne Howard of Tacoma, between the North Jetty & North Head, moving north.

Grandkids and I were at Ft. Ebey State Park at about

3:30
when we saw a pod of
Orcas
off Partridge Point. We watched for more than a 1/2 hour - a feeding frenzy of sorts- lots of activity and splashing. We couldn't see what was keeping them there so long, but figured they'd found food of some sort. When we left, they were still putting on quite a show for all the tourists visiting the park.

The group of
5 T's
(yet to be ID'd) killed the steller at around
1740
. They looked like they had been well on there way with him when I arrived at around 1650. I noticed a bull on the outskirts which I kept an eye on while the group of 5 were working on the steller and was able to positively ID him as T14. I've sent some photos to Graeme Ellis and hopefully will get an ID on the others soon. I will also be sending pictures to the Centre and maybe Dave Ellifrit can ID them as I have no idea as I haven't seen this group before.

Mary Vaughan of Sierra, NW of Coupeville, called at

5:30 pm
to report seeing the
orcas
off Partridge Pt.

We were along on the Beach Watchers' fundraising cruise on the Mystic Sea for a gray whale watch today - saw 1, possibly 2
grays
feeding very close in to the beach north of Greenbank off North Bluff at about

12:30 - 1 pm
, then received word of several grays breaching down by Hat/Gedney Island, so motored south & found them (saw some Dall's porpoise on the way) around
2 -
2:30 pm
, watched what looked like 2 adults & 1 young gray close to shore off Hat/Gedney Island, saw some spy-hopping & fluking. Just as we were pulling into Penn Cove around 4 pm, we got a call from Island Adventures, relaying an unconfirmed report of orcas off Partridge Pt (on the west side of Whidbey). Soon as we got off the boat we raced over to Partridge Pt. thinking it wasn't likely we'd see anything - we arrived there around
4:30 or
4:45 pm, & there they were - right off the Point! So we watched from the point until
5:30 pm in the pouring rain - it looked like 4 - 6 transients, making several kills, traveling back & forth not far offshore. At one point we were pretty sure we could see a porpoise or something being tossed around (see Mark Malleson's report above - it turned out to be a Stellar sea lion they were after!)

The whales were at East Point (Foxes Spit) about

10:30
with two
Grays
rubbing on the beach in very shallow water splashing and waving pectoral fins. Then we left them south bound in the middle of Saratoga Passage doing side by side simultaneous flukeing complete with several double flukes. We remained at least 150 yards at all times, much farther than the 30 to 50 feet the beachwatchers and dogs were maintaining. The second surprise found us between Camano Head, Hat Island and Sandy Point at about

13:15
with the same set of Grays, still southbound and entering building seas. This time they fascinated me and my private clients with several (7 for sure) breaches of an adult Gray. These were not lunge feeds. They were full blown efforts at traveling breaches. one right after the other in a span of about 10 minutes, the likes of which I have never seen before from a Gray.

Mary Pacher, north of Greenbank, called at

8:12 am
to report a
gray
feeding very close to shore, about 200' offshore. She called back at
8:16 am to say it was 2 whales, & possibly a 3rd younger whale, all feeding side by side.
