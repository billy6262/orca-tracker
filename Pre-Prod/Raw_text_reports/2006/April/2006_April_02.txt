We just spotted a
gray
whale off Langley, WA at

11:00 a.m
. I was standing approx, across from the police station on Front Street and noticed a disturbance in the water that was not waves maybe only 100 yds off the breakwall. And there he/she was. He surfaced and we could see his entire body gliding along south toward the marina and Sandy Point. We could see him and hear him blow and also as he glided he would lift his tail to "wave" at us. We followed him to the marina where he had moved out to mid channel. He continued to move swiftly south and the last we saw of him from the marina dock was mid channel in the deep water south of Gedney Island....several more blows and tail waves.
