Orca Sightings for April 25, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw
orcas
today. At
645pm
, I saw a group of 3-4 orcas, by binoculars, from my house on a bluff by Seahurst park in Burien. I watched them travel north toward Brace point, and then they seemed to be milling about very close to a group of birds. 30 minutes later I saw two of them headed south toward Three Tree point.
