Orca Sightings for April 24, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband Paul and I were taking our boat up north to Everett and had the wonderful luck to watch 2 gorgeous
gray
whales in between the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry path. We watched them from

6:00-
6:15pm
. Lots of backs, blows, and flukes.

Around

2:30 PM
, I noticed a small group of
orcas
swimming near Lime Kiln. I'll assume they were J-Pod, as I had to keep my eyes more on the road than on the water. 2 hours later, they were just coming up to Kellett Bluff, heading slowly north. Looked like a leisurely pace.

We watched
J pod
go north up the west side of the island from about
1 p.m. to 4 p.m
. None were too close to shore, and most were about a quarter to a half mile out. Initially, they were spread out from Pile Point to Andrews Bay, foraging, milling, and playing a little. J1 (Ruffles) and J2 (Granny) were among the lead whales. J30 did a little show as he went by LandBank. At one point he came up with a fish in his mouth and kelp wrapped around him as he played at the surface, before heading on to Lime Kiln. The stragglers became a large group at Andrews Bay--I'm not sure how that happened. First there were 4 or 5, including the two youngest calves, then more and more of the pod joined up. Some of them must have circled back, or something. At about 4 pm this group was passing Andrews Bay, still going north.

Martin in Seiku reported a really large
gray
whale in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, just east of Snow Creek heading east toward Chito Beach.

I was just watching the many flocks of birds skimming up Saratoga Passage and a huge
Gray
surfaced, then dove, flukes high in the air at
~6 am
. It put on quite a show out about mid-channel from here for about 10 minutes. I could tell it wasn’t Patch, but I don’t know the others well enough to guess who it might be. Then it turned and headed straight for us (East Pt). It’s down below right now, probably having a great shrimp breakfast.
