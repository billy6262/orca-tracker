============================================================

Entry 1:
Mary Gattis of Oak Harbor called to report seeing ~6
gray
whales in Crescent Harbor, NE Whidbey, close in to shore near the Navy Base.
*
We watched a
gray
whale feeding off our property. We are half way between Mariners Cove and Polnell Shores (NE Whidbey Isl). He/she stayed in the area where we could see it for about an hour. This was between
3pm and 4pm
.

Phil Litrenta called at

4:15 pm
to report 3
grays
off Forbes Pt, between Crescent Harbor & Penn Cove, heading NW toward Crescent Harbor.
*
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report 2
gray
whales 1 mile north of Clinton, S. Whidbey Isl. at

1:20 pm
, heading south at a quick pace. Tom called with an update at 2 pm - the grays had been ID'd as #56 & #531, & were off Clinton, heading toward Gedney/Hat Island.
*
Right now, there are two
Grays
heading around the tip if East Point toward Bell’s Beach at

10:40 am
. They’ve been feeding down below us for a while. Also, there seem to be porpoises everywhere I look today. They have popped up around Baby Island, over toward North Bluff, all across the Passage between here and Camano State Park and down below us where the Grays were feeding.

We watched two [
gray
] whales (possibly #21 & #22) traveling from just north of Langley down to the Clinton ferry dock area. In the afternoon we caught up with the same two whales at Possession point. To our amazement, one of the whales breached twice just about 300 ft off the bow!! Fabulous and unusual behavior for our Puget Sound regulars!!! Later we noticed a third whale, # 53, had joined the other two and were all traveling south together at a pretty good speed.

Mary Jo Oxrider of East Pt, Whidbey Island called to report seeing
gray
whale blows across Saratoga Passage off Camano Island State Park, & a school of porpoise off East Pt. at approx.

8:30 am
.
*
After receiving the report about grays in Elger Bay (below), I looked out the window & saw spouts! I watched at least 3
grays
feeding off Elger Bay & Lowell Pt, close to the Camano side & heading slowly north from

7:50 am -
8:15 am
, until they were too obscured by trees.
*
4 Large
Gray
Whales are currently feeding in Elger Bay, Saratoga Passage off Camano Island. We first spotted them about

7:00 am
today. They appear to be the same four that were in Elger Bay Wednesday. They are not coming out of the water high enough to distinguish markings or scars...and we are high on the bluff over looking the bay. They appear to be eating the ghost-shrimp...we see side fins and a heads only.
