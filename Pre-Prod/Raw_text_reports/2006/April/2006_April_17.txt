Orca Sightings for April 17, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I noticed some distant ripples about mid-channel of Haro Strait. Grabbed the binoculars in time to see 3
orcas
heading slowly north, surrounded by 6 zodiacs. Couldn't tell from the distance whether they were residents or transients, but my first orcas for 2006!
