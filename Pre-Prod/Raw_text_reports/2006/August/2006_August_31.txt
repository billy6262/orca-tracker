Orca Sightings for August 31, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
orcas
, and
minke's
and
humpbacks
. As we left the dock, we heard a report of 4
transients
heading towards San Juan, so our spirits jumped immensely. Then the boat "Sea Lion" called and let us know they found a minke. We stopped to watch the minke for a bit before heading over to the Transients, which were about 1 mile further. Then someone called out that they were surprised to find a huge humpback just 1/2 a mile south of the transients! We were able to watch the humback about 400 yards from us in one direction while watching the Transients about 300 yards in the other direction.

Around
noon
today, Jim on the Victoria Clipper IV sighted
T44, 41 and 41A
just north and west of the Echo Romeo traffic separation buoy south-southwest of Hein Bank and the whales were sighted again around 1315 by whale watchers at the ODAS buoy south of Seabird Point, Discovery Island. The orca travelled in a straight line north for over one hour and when my vessel left the "scene" the Orca were within one mile of a only recently discovered
Humpback
feeding in the tidal confluence where the opposing flows of the eastern Juan de Fuca and Haro straits meet. There were many hundreds of seabirds feeding on the visible shoals of tiny fish. At one point the Orca and Humpback were within three quarters of a mile. We met the T's and other whale watchers at about 4NM south of the point.
