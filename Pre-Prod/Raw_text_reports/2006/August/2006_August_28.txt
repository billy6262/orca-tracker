Orca Sightings for August 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
From approximately

13:30 -
15:00
, Saturna Island East point to Saturna Island Monarch Head. 25-35 Southern Resident
Orcas
traveling East through boundary pass. Too many to count, spread out over about one to two kilometers in 5-7 groups. Two groups made a very close pass at the East Point light house, the rest remained further offshore while traveling. There were numerous instances where Orcas doubled back, reversing direction for a few minutes. Dozens of breaches witnessed, at least 8 spy hops witnessed, lots of tail and fin slapping - overall, an awful lot of spectacular display for well over an hour that we observed them. Numerous mature males and one very young juvenile swimming close to a female - but we're not experienced observers and there were too many for us to make any definitive ID's.

We observed what we believed to be
Orcas
off of the Blake Island Marina at

11:30 pm
. It was dark and hard to see but we did see at least 2-3 dorsals. They hung around for about 30 minutes before heading south.

The
L12's
and friends meandered between Eagle Point and Pile Point most of the day. At 4pm about 6
transients
, including one large male, were travelling north in Haro Strait approximately a mile off Land Bank. As I watched them, I noticed another pod of 4 to 6 transients travelling north much closer to the shore. This group did not have any big males, but did have several juveniles. After they passed the Lighthouse, they headed more off shore and tucked in behind a large barge. I saw several Dall's porpoises racing wildly away, but the transients didn't change course. After travelling up island a while more, they headed west and joined up with the other transients. All the transients then travelled slowly toward the north west. As the transients were doing this, the
J's, K's and the rest of the L's
were coming south past Kellett Bluff. As I was intently watching whether there would be any observable interactions or changed behavior from the transients and residents coming so close (maybe a mile apart or less), I was startled by a huge blow from one of the L12's who raced by LandBank about 20 yards off the beach. Then I noticed what was likely all the other L's who had been south, porpoising furiously north. (Talk about my powers of observation.) I followed the L12's to County Park, where they almost went unnoticed meeting the other orcas. They barely met, turned around, then L25 led the pods south. At that point the tide was flooding and the whales slowly made their way south, spread from in shore to at least a mile off SJI. I don't know if some whales turned back north or not, since it didn't appear that they all came south. All in all, very cool to watch transients and residents at the same time.
