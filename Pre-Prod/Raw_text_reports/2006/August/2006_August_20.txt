Orca Sightings for August 20, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a great day with
all three pods
as they passed Turn Point heading south. Most of the whales were in groups spread out over a mile or so wide and long, which meant that no matter where you looked, you saw whales somewhere on the horizon. One of the first whales we saw appeared to be K22, but she was backlit so I couldn't be sure. I do know I saw a very very small baby orca traveling nearby other K whales, so the crew naturally was quite excited! The whales must have been in high spirits as there were dozens of breaches, tail lobs, and I saw my first 5 second headstand today! Great and plentiful vocalizations as the whales unhurriedly meandered south towards Henry Island.
