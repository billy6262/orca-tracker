Orca Sightings for August 16, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the
five o'clock
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry I saw two
Orcas
. My friend thought one was a small young one but I can't validate that. We did see two and they were not more than 100 feet from the ferry heading north up the passage.

A group of
Orca
whales passed in front of our house about

4:30 PM
. There were five whales. There appeared to be at least one male in the group. There were what appeared to be 4 adults and one infant whale. The Whales were heading south. They came around Randle Point and were moving rather rapidly south towards the Clinton Ferry dock and down towards Possession Point.

Mike Moser called to report seeing an
orca
in Port Susan, near Tulalip - no time give, but likely one of the group of T's.
*
Donna Leahy called to report 4 or 5
orcas
, including a large male, south of the Clinton ferry landing on S. Whidbey Island at

1:40 pm
. She could not determine direction of travel.

A
Gray
whale was feeding very close to the coastline between Cresent Bay and Pillar Pt [
in BC, western Strait of Juan de Fuca
]. I am unsure of the whales gender but it appeared to have been a veteran of the coast and perhaps a few predation attempts. There was a lot of parallel scarring. A US sailboat the "Sea Wizard" reported seeing a pod of
Orca
west of Port Renfrew early Wednesday morning. The skipper said they were headed west. The last two weeks has seen a lot of US & Canadian naval activity in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Air Craft Carriers, Trident subs and anti-sub helicopter frigates have been keeping the Salish Sea busy as of late. Not to be out done, A live fire exercise was conducted in the area off Jordan River by the HMCS NANAIMO. http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/nanaimo/home/index_e.asp With Killer whales only just west of there, I hope that they stay out west a little while longer.

orca[?]
in Hammersley Inlet, at the mouth of Oakland Bay tonight coming in with the high tide.
*
Capt. McGuire of the Wash. State Ferry Spokane, called in an updated report on the
Transient
pod - at

12:10 pm
they were off the Edmonds ferry dock, northbound heading toward Possession Sound.
*
0900
, saw approximately 4 to 6
orca
in Elliott Bay, Seattle just south of the Elliott Bay Marina, heading west along that coastline. They were seen from Duwamish Head, West Seattle, without binoculars, so genders and exact numbers were indeterminate. Dorsals of two orca were seen simultaneously.

At least 6
orcas
in the middle of Elliot Bay - seen from the

8:45am
Bainbridge ferry to Seattle (off of north side of vessel). I've never seen them this close to the Seattle side before - I'd triangulate their position as being directly between the western tips of Magnolia and West Seattle. One group of about 3 was closest in, and another 3-4 were about 100-200 yards west, in the shipping lanes. They were traveling west/northwest at about
9:00am, some spyhopping, breaching. A group of 3 was surrounding a small (one-person) craft (possibly a rowboat?) and another group of 3-4 (or more) was about 100 yards west out in the shipping channel.
