Orca Sightings for August 4, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
all 3 pods
on the west side of San Juan during the morning, but by afternoon, they were in Swanson Channel making tracks for Active Pass. They were very active, porpoising and getting a ride in his prop wash. Then as all three pods exited Active Pass, they began to put on an aerial display, with dozens of single breaches, and a half dozen double breaches, multiple spyhops, one double spyhop, and one breach combined with a nearby whale spyhopping. J-1 Ruffles did a lot of foraging behaviors with multiple quick direction changes, J-26 Mike did some huge belly breaches, and J27 Blackberry did some more distant breaches. As we left, we heard whales were spreading out, some going further east towards the river, and J's heading south towards Pt. Roberts.

About

2:45 pm
-- big bunch of [
orcas
] heading east through Active Pass. A wide resting line stretched almost from one side of the pass to the other. Then it broke into smaller groups when the ferry came through. Lots of half breeches and tail slapping. I am not sure which pod. Gary, my husband, thought he saw Mr. Ruffles but I didn't.

As I passed Lime Kiln at

9:25 a.m
., I heard echolation clicks and what I thought were K Pod's "mewing" calls on the hydrophones, so I stopped immediately. While a lot of
orcas
had already passed the Light going north, reportedly including some L pod whales, I managed to see about 20 whales. The J17 matriline (Princess Angeline's), probably accompanied by Rhapsody, made a close pass by the Light. The others were more off shore, up to about 1/2 mile out. I was not able to identify any K pod whales, but later I heard that K pod was north of San Juan Island with the J's.
