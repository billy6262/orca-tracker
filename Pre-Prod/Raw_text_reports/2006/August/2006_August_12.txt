Orca Sightings for August 12, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

12:30pm
we come across
all three pods
out in the Haro as we rounded out of Speiden Channel just north of Henry Island, all spread out, some lolly-gagging, some appeared to go every which way, and some breaching, and some in towards shore, and all over out in the middle.
