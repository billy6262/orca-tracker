Orca Sightings for August 25, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I want to let you know that the whale that I reported on Thursday is still frequenting the Nisqually buoy area. We saw it at about

6:50 pm
. It surfaced twice, close in to the buoy in about 120' of water. After that, we didn't see it again.
