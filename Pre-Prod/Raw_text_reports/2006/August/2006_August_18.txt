Today there were three groups of
T's
: this morning at around

11:30
we found a group of at least five transients (including a very small calf) just northwest of Dungeness spit with no specific direction. At around

3:30pm
, there were two groups in the SJIs area, a group heading up San Juan Channel (perhaps four animals, including one young male), wandering around Turn Island, and then taking Upright to the northeast. The
third group
(again, around
3:30) was south of Cattle Pass (4 or 5 animals, one male) heading generally west. We left them in the middle of the Strait at about
5:30pm. All were taking very long dives, with the typical eratic transient style.

At
2:50 p.m. we found a group of four transients three miles west of Cattle Point in Haro Strait moving west slowly. There was an adult male, adult female and two juveniles. Our our way back into Cattle Pass another group of four or five transients appeared in front of us. This family traveled up the shore of Lopez, right past Shark Reef and then they cut across San Juan Channel, and started hunting in and out of each little bay on the east shore of San Juan Island. They split up and two took one side of a rocky outcropping, and two took the other. Sometimes one adult would cut back in the opposite direction, and three would swim closer to the next rock with maybe 10 - 15 seals gathered on the end of the rock! Everyone was waiting to see if a seal would disappear, but the whales kept moving, then regrouping, and then moving on and doing the same thing over again. Then the adult male with this group did a huge spy hop, right by Turn Island and at the same time one of the other adults did a beautiful breach! The group then formed up again, crossed to Turn Island Rock and light, swam a few circles around the light and suddenly headed off down Upright Channel toward Canoe Island.

This afternoon we were fortunate enough to find ourselves in the company of not one group, but two separate groups of
Transients
! First we found a group of 5 Transients about 2 miles south of Cattle Point. Flat seas and few boats made for clear viewing. One large male and four smaller whales in the group. I heard on the radio that one of the whales was T10. On our return trip back up San Juan Channel, four more transients heading the same direction! It was so incredible to watch these whales stop at Shark Reef, then circle a small rock near Turn Island that was absolutely loaded with seals. We left the Transients just past the green 3 buoy as they continued towards Shaw Island.

Alan Hall called at

1:50 pm
to report a whale between Hammersley Inlet & Oakland Bay, near Shelton, S. Puget Sound. From his description, it sounded like a possible
humpback
. He reported it has been around since Tuesday, Aug. 15. Cascadia Research has had several similar sightings of this animal, & hopefully will be able to get out & ID it.

Tom Pollgreen at Potlach just reported to us that a
pod
of undetermined numbers had been sighted at
9am
just south of Triton Point in Hood Canal. We are at this time unable to determine if they are transients or residents.
