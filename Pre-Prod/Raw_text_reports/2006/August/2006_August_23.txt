Orca Sightings for August 23, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients
in Georgia Strait outside and north of Active Pass. Later on, got word from Simon on "Neptune" that they had headed into the Pass. At
2 pm
, they had exited the Pass and turned NW not down Swanson Channel. We heard that they had split up, with some continuing NW and others coming around the top of Prevost Island and heading south. We met them right at the Channel Islands. "Keiko" was on the other side of the whales and mentioned a seal bobbing nearby. They nailed it!!! I dropped the hydrophone but they didn't talk about it. They had taken at least three other seals before we arrived.

Keith Wood called at

4:35 pm
to report
J, K & L pods
4 nautical miles offshore near Port Renfrew, S.W. Vancouver Island. He recorded 45 minutes of vocalizations, lots of sex play & socializing, no real direction of travel - basic Superpod behavior.

Robin Baird of Cascadia Research called to report that a
Minke
whale stranded live & died shortly thereafter ~
2 pm
in LIttle Skookum Inlet, NW of Olympia in S. Puget Sound. This is near Hammeresley Inlet, where we have had reports of a lone orca &/or humpback &/or Minke - perhaps this is the whale that has been reported over the past weeks. Cascadia Research is conducting a necropsy & will let us know what the results are.
