Orca Sightings for August 24, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tonight while fishing near the buoy at the mouth of the Nisqually, a whale surfaced twice. It was mid channel, traveling northward. We first saw it come up and blow (loudly) close by - it showed a fairly long, and very sickle-shaped dorsal fin. No flukes. It surfaced again to the north, towards Ketron Island. Again, the dorsal was prominent. The blow itself was not visible either time. This was near dusk, about

7:50 pm
. The whale appeared all black, with no lighter patches. It was hard to judge the size - but I would guess about that of a small orca. The fin was more curved than orcas that I've seen - it looked more like that of a
minke
whale.

We had the
J's, K's and L's
come in from the west in the Juan De Fuca as well as the
T100's, T46b and T46b1
. We spent the day with some more transients that were picked up on the eastern side of Galiano Island. They split up at the mouth of the western side of Active Pass. A group of 3-4 transients that I was not able to ID went north and another group of 5-6 meandered their way south between Saltspring island and Prevost Island making a few seal kills. After dinner I met up with them off the south west side of Saltspring Island and followed them to the mouth of Cowichan Bay. I was able to ID T46, T46C, T46D, T46E. There was another female and a small calf about a year old that I wasn't able to ID.

Transients
just south of Prevost Island. We saw the T-41's and 46's, and we had the rare opportunity of seeing two kills (but at 220+ yards we were spared the gruesome aspects of transients eating seals). The whales were traveling in a very tight group, slowly heading south down Swanson Channel.

A group of about 6
orcas
went WEST (very unusual, in our experience) through Active Pass about

1:15
. Travelling rapidly, hugging the shore of Mayne Island. The male had a dorsal fin that flops to the left (sounds like T40?) and there was one small whale in the group.
