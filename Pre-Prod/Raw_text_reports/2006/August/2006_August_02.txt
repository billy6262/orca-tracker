Orca Sightings for August 2, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
K's
made their way from False bay this morning to a few miles west of Dungeness Spit (almost off of Port Angeles) this
afternoon
. When we left them around 5pm the whole pod had just grouped up in a resting pattern, and had turned back in the direction of the San Juans.

K's
heading off shore from false bay toward middle bank. A
minke
mixed in with Lobo K26, lea K14 and Yoda K36. We saw the minke surface 4 times. Each time a new direction. The 3 K's did steady travel at about 7 knots and then an abrupt turn in sync 90 degrees right towards us. We shut down and after 3 breathes and a deep dive they resurfaced 9 minutes late an easy half mile in the opposite direction. Meanwhile the minke kept surfacing every 4 minutes. One can only wonder about what happens down there.

Another
sea otter
sighting,

8:40 a.m.
off the point at the north end of the cove, that is located to the north of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. Once again on back, barrel roll, etc. then there was something different. The sea otter raised something into the air and all I can figure out is that it was his arm and maybe he was tucking away the tool he uses to crack open shells. I understand that they hold on to their favorite 'rock' so they don't have to go looking for another.
