Last night I got to the park (west side San Juan Island) about

7:00 pm
. I heard the faint puff of a whale {
orca
] blowing. They were just coming around the point. I sat with the binoculars watching two pods of about 9 whales each go past. The sun was back lighting their spray and slaps. There was one pod with what looked like two yearlings and two new borns. One was so tiny. I watched them pass Low Is. and go up into a tide rip where they started to feed ( I think). They were rolling and cavorting about. As the sun slipped behind Vancouver the whales turned around. Another pod must have shown up because three groups passed by. As they got to Low Island they started spyhopping, tail slapping, and breaching.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to say
J pod
had come up the west side of San Juan Island, passing by the Center at aroun

7:30 pm
, they were spread out, then gathered up into groups, turned around at the height of the tide & came back heading south past the Center at
8:30 pm, continuing south down the west side of San Juan Island.

As soon as the boats left at about

6:30 pm, J pod
got into energy-mode heading north just off Pile Point. J1 (Ruffles) and J2 (Granny) were determinedly leading the way, with about 4 others. The rest of the pod were more playful, took more time exploring their old hangouts, kelping, and making very close passes at Land Bank and Lime Kiln. At Lime Kiln J8 (Speiden) popped up right in front of us less than 10 yards away. Some of the others were about the same distance. We left them heading to Bellevue Point at about
7:45 p.m.

Now we wait, are they back or still toying with us. Great to see all of
Jpod
here.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called to report they were with
J pod
, saw everyone but J2, though they figure she was probably there, just not seen. They also saw Harbor & Dall's porpoise & Sea Lions - a great day on the water!

We had 2
Grey
whales feeding 100 yards off shore at Spee-Bi-Dah (east side of Port Susan) at

8:00 pm
. One was clearly Patch. We find it interesting that this is about the 5th or 6th visit by Grays this year. Last year we were having 3 or 4 a week. Low tide uncovers only about 20 to 25 feeding holes. Last year at this time there were closer to 200. This same thing may have happened the previous 2 years. Would like to know if this is happening in other feeding areas.

I am delighted to report hearing 2 [
gray
] whales blow past Tulalip Shores about

7:30 pm
. I wasn't able to see them until they got to the cove at Spee-Bi-Dah, where they leisurely fed along the shore for the next hour. This is only my second sighting this year in Port Susan and I was thinking that perhaps the fishing wasn't so good over here this year!

Had a lovely day up here in the San Juans. I drove the westside at about
1120
this morning and
J pod
was right at Deadman's Bay. They seemed to be spread out down past Edward's Point and turned back south around 1130. We saw them again this evening (1730) grouped up at False Bay.
