Orca Sightings for May 26, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just as the high tide went slack for a few minutes around

6:00 PM
on Friday evening, a pod (J's?) of
orcas
entered Georgeson Bay at the southwest end of Active Pass. After they rounded Helen Point on Mayne Island, they wasted little time in the area, swimming fast and straight towards Matthews Point on Galiano Island.

I started off above Hannah Heights at about

10:00 a.m
. today watching
J pod
milling and traveling slowly north. J2 and J8 were leading, when something caught their eye. On the surface they abruptly circled, dove, then each came up holding a fish. They then resumed traveling north slowly, surfacing high and still holding their fish in their mouths each time they surfaced. When I got back at about
11:40 a.m., J pod was again in front of Hannah. Some whales were off shore and some closer in. They were still traveling north. When I got to LandBank there was already a crowd watching J pod go slowly north, occasionally spyhopping, tail-slapping and breaching.

Received a call from Phillip Glenn, on a charter boat in California, reporting 8 - 9
orcas
, including 1 male, off False Cape, N. CA, near Cape Mendocino, heading south. There was blood in the water, so these were likely Transients.

I saw
orcas
from the Race Rocks cam this
morning
. They were very distant from the cam, south of Race Rocks and West of Port Angeles. I saw a couple, one of which had a large, thin dorsal. They didn't appear to be doing anything much but difficult to see and I soon lost sight of them. The time was about
7.20a.m
.
