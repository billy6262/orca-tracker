============================================================

Entry 1:
Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called to report
J pod
about 1 mile offshore of the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, west San Juan Island at
7 pm
, vocalizing & playing with a small harbor porpoise. The porpoise tried to escape by coming right along side the boat. J's had gone out to Race Rocks & back this afternoon.

Received a call from Scott - reporting 5
orcas
off Neah Bay, by Waddah Island, in the
evening.

Just got a call from Chad Bowechop of the Makah Tribe who tells me a pod of 6
orca
came into Neah Bay around
6PM
and killed a sea lion after playing with it for a bit.

No idea when they went west but
Jpod

As the sun set I saw
J Pod
come back in (apparently they were "hiding" out in the Straits as I suspected), and slowly made their way north in the middle of Haro Strait.
