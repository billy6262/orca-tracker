Orca Sightings for May 23, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
taking an
early morning
roll in the bull kelp along Land Bank land this morning! J-8 Speiden gave me a nice look as she passed, her distinctive wheeze hanging in the air. Later in the day, they demonstrated the west side shuffle near Eagle Point, changing direction no less than 4 times. A few breaches and tailslaps from one group (3-4' swells made ID'ing a bit iffy) that appeared to include J-19 & her little one J-41.
