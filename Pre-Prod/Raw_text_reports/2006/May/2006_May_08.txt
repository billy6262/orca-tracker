Jpod
off the west side this morning. The whales were far apart off False Bay when we got there, in the afternoon they had regrouped and going up island. Last I heard they were at the North end of Henry Is. going North at

J-Pod
decided that with sunny skies and glassy water, that it was time to show up again along San Juan Island. Demonstrating the classic "West Side Shuffle", the whales headed up the west side around
2 PM
, only to turn around at Kellett Bluff and head South around 4 PM. One group close in to shore looked to be checking out every kelp bed, and I saw J26 Mike do a quick lunge, but couldn't see if he caught anything. Last saw J-Pod passing Low Island heading slowly south.

This
morning at
6:15
we watched about 8
orcas
including one large male (J1?) go through Peavine Pass headed east. They were traveling very close to the shore of Obstruction Island and paused for one spyhop, one breach and lots of tailslapping. After they went out of sight we zoomed down to Driftwood Beach and watched them come out of the pass; it looked like they were heading for Lummi.
