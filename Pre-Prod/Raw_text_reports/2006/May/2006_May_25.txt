Entry 1:
My husband Simon reports that when he was at bluff edge about
8pm
, he observed a lone large
gray
whale swimming in circles and feeding in the waters below our yard on the West end of First St, Langley.

LOTS of
orcas
with J's AND L's traveling north past the Center for Whale Research towards Kellett Bluff (~

10:30 am
). They are in big groups, and are porpoising in the currents.
