Orca Sightings for May 14, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
6 to 8 [
orcas
] at least 2 babies went by, but I got distracted reporting the fin whale, which at first looked like a capsized boat. Neptune Beach is between Cherry Point and Sandy Point. West of Ferndale. By the refinery (Mobil, BP, Tosco, whatever it is this year)

J's were spread out over several miles of water about a mile or so Southeast of Coleville. As we slowly approached, one orca breached 3 times, just as I was talking about whale behavior (how convenient!). As the whales went by in scattered groups of two or three, one whale gave us a beautiful "belly button" spyhop, held it for a second or two before sliding back in the water. Towards the end of the day, I notice 3-4 cormorants sitting on a log and wondered if the whales would approach them. Sure enough, J-28 launched out of the water, scattering the birds in all directions! Then Polaris proceeded to breach 3 more times. We also had a group of 12-15
transients
reported out near Hein Bank, but we didn't have time to go take a peek.

this morning at the North end of Hale Passage was finally intercepted by us around 4 PM in Lummi Bay in shallow water.Looks like a
Fin
to me- though only right side and ventral showing. Also murky water and head stuck in mud- saw white baleen on the right- could not see the left side of the head/jaw or dorsal fin. Male- approx. 19 meters long, 340 cm fluke span, 210 cm pectoral length. 48 45.650 North latitude 122 40.196 West longitude.
