Orca Sightings for May 3, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was

12:30
and we saw two
grays
spouting and rolling. We saw them from Mukilteo--Chennault Beach/Olympus Terrace area. The whales were over closer to Whidbey than our side. We watched as they made their way north toward the Mukilteo Ferry route. I never saw tail but definitely two spouts.

gray
whales from the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry at

12:45 pm

In the middle of Saratoga Passage, I looked out this AM (

9:30
) and close below our bluff just south of Mabana were 2
gray
whales, one large, the other smaller, feeding on the ghost shrimp beds. They were in so close, and the sun was just right, so that you could see the entire whale. WOW! Part of the time they were on their sides with flukes and fins exposed, and part of the time they were cruising along just below the surface. Unfortunately, they did not linger, they headed NW.
