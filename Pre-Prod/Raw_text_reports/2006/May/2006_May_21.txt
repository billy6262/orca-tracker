We had
J-pod
off San Juan Island, and saw 4 breaches from a young lady, Ruffles was lunging at the surface as he pursued a salmon or two! There was 2
minkes
in the midst of J’s off Salmon Bank. We had a group of 4 or 5 harbour porpoises that we were passing by, and I saw one full body breach out of the water! Then to top it all off we had reports of a
humpback
whale in Victoria Harbour no less, our first humpback of the season. We came across the young animal off Ogden Point, east bound along the shore.

Heard reports of Orcas (
J-Pod
) coming slowly up the west side of San Juan, but they never made it up to the house, so we zipped down in the car to the land bank land east of Deadman's Bay. Just in time to see Polaris, J-19 with J-41 as they played in the kelp bed. At one point, Polaris came within 15 feet of shore. Lots of upside down swimming, lobtailing, a fantastic spyhop, and "fluke flossing" with the bull kelp. One large breach as well. We then chugged down the road to Eagle Cove and watched the crew from Cascadia Research doing a fecal follow on J-1 Ruffles.

Met
J pod
at Salmon Bank this morning. They were very spread out, Ruffles being almost a mile away from the rest at times. Two groups of three and five whales respectively were traveling near each other. Two
minkes
were also present at the same location.

This morning we've had unusual whale sightings at Chito Beach. One whale has been feeding for the last three hours back and forth, and in circles between Chito Point and Shipwreck Point (7-8 miles west of Sekiu). At first it appeared to be a gray - definite dorsal ridge, color, barnacles, however it has a large bulbous mass on its head. We questioned if it was a pilot, but pilot whales don't have the dorsal ridge. We also wondered if it was carrying something in it's mouth? It's behaviors are unusual also.......feeding inside the kelp bed, doing circles around the small fishing boat, moving throughout the kelp bed. Several of us are yet unsure what this whale is. Usually grays feed outside the kelp bed. None of us can figure out the bulbous mass....probably the size of a large basketball. Some kind of growth? Great day for gawking through binocs!
