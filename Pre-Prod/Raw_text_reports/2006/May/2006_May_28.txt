Orca Sightings for May 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod
has been hanging around the islands more regularly these days, and today they once again demonstrated their patented "West Side Shuffle", traveling up the west side in the
morning
, turning and going down to American Camp late morning, and then back towards Lime Kiln in the late
afternoon
. Whales were very spread out over several miles, with J1, J2, and an unidentified female traveling several miles offshore while the rest of the J's were closer in. We got a very nice view of J11 with her calf J39, traveling with J27. One calf (ID unknown) did a couple of nice breaches. J-Pod this evening heading south from Kellett Bluff back towards Lime Kiln.
