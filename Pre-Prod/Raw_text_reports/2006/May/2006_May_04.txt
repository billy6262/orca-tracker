Word came out that
J Pod
was traveling past Cherry Point on their way down Rosario Channel. As a giant ocean-going tug passed us mid-channel, suddenly there were 3
orcas
in his wake. They began breaching like mad in the tug's wake. And then J1 Ruffles popped up out of nowhere and passed us on the opposite side of the breaching whales. Always nice to see J-1, but later in the trip he'd do something truly awe-inspiring. As we watched J-2 Granny and J-14 with J-40 riding the current several hundred yards in front of us, I spotted a small dorsal fin stealthy coming back up the channel. And then the dorsal showed up closer and I realized it was Ruffles! He went down and the next time he came up, it was right near the boat, and he showed his chin only, then rolled on his side, popping his head out of water, and it appeared to me that he was looking right at me! I locked eyes for a few seconds, and then he rolled back upright and slowly paralleled the boat. He began to actively porpoise and lunge first one way and then another as he came upon a fish near the boat. We last observed J-Pod slowly coalescing from many groups and heading past Thatcher Pass.
