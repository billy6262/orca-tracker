Orca Sightings for May 10, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-pod
was heading North at Village Point, Lummi Island this afternoon. We ID J1, J2, J8, J19, J41, J30, J27, and J28. They was lots of Lob-tailing and a breach. The calves were doing alot of the Lob-tailing. We also had 2 stellar's, one at Peapod rocks and the other near Barnes Island.

Just got word of
Orcas
, most likely J pod, just east of Eliza! Maybe they came through Hale Pass? Shane went to find them at Vancouver yesterday but couldn't. It's not usual to see them in Bellingham Bay.
