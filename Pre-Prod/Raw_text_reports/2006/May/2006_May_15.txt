Orca Sightings for May 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Looking out at the water around

4:30 PM
, I noticed a fin in a flat spot on the water. Looking with binoculars, I noticed it was my favorite
orca J-1
! He was traveling all by himself, and it wasn't until 15-20 minutes later that I saw the rest of J-Pod slowly coming up the west side of San Juan Island. They continued on up North as I went back to my chores.
