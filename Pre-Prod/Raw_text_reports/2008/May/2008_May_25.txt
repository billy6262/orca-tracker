The
gray whale
was again in front of our community. I was looking down on the beach at yesterday's feeding pits about

3:30 PM
and spotted the gray whale spouting out over the drop-off (The tide was still out quite a ways). This evening about 10 PM, I stepped out on the deck, and could again hear the whale feeding close in below the bluff as the tide was now in and it could get into the ghost shrimp beds. Maybe our ghost shrimp have reached just the right state of tastiness! It's such a privilege to share with them.

Writing to report a spectacular sighting in Dalco Pass. I live on the water a few houses up from the Tahlequah ferry dock, facing out towards the southwest over dalco pass, point defiance park and gig harbor. Over the past 2 weeks we've had multiple sightings. First, the mist from the "blow", then the dark shape with notch. I also heard him blow quite close by on several occasions without actually seeing him. Yesterday (sat 5/24) and today (sun 5/25) we were treated to a lot of tail-flipping. This morning its tail flipped out about 7 or 8 times in succession, every 10 seconds or so. Then he waved an enormous fin, which was dark on the topside and speckled with white underneath. Had binocs for pretty good viewing, and will keep camera on hand for the next show.
