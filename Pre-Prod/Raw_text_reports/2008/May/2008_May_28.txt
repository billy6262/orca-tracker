Orca Sightings for May 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
was spread out over a few miles, milling, not much tidal exchange, on the south end of San Juan Island. From

1:22pm to
2:24pm
we were treated to a variety of behaviours- spy hops, breaches, cartwheels, headstands, pectoral & fluke slaps. J-32 Rhapsody did a slow rollover pass by. We were also able to ID J-22, Oreo & the kids J-34 Doublestuf, J-38 Cookie, J-2 Granny (relieved to see her return each year), and the 'boys', teenagers J-26 Mike & J-27 Blackberry. We also enjoyed continuous vocalizations! Saw kelp draping over rostrums- is it this year's game? From my perspective, it looked like all the boats were following the regulations. SoundWatch was out in their new boat - I hope they agree. Beam Reach was also out doing their research. And the 'pooper scoopers' were following J-26, it was kinda funny, because at one point he turned so they immediately turned away from him, then he was following them! J-26 is getting bigger than their boat!

Just got in off the FREEMAN last night on a FE salmon feed study cruise. Saw fair numbers of large whales -
Grey, fin & Humpback
+ the highlight was a dusk passing of a big male
KW
, at least two females and a calf when we were about 50 miles west of Willapa bay (46 40'N 124 47'W) . Time was approximately
19:20. Animals appeared to be moving in a Northerly direction.

J pod
- Pender Island
2025
. We just had three whales off our property on Mouat Point, North Pender Island. The male has a definite Port side bend to the dorsal fin, the other two appeared to be smaller, with smaller dorsal fins; females or juveniles? They were feeding and there was one huge leap before they continued Northwestward up Swanson Channel. Oops, just caught the sounds and brief sight of 3 or 4 more, following the first group. no id of any.

J pod
- Pender Island, between

7:30pm and
8:45pm
, we observed members of J-Pod pass Thieves Bay on Pender Island. We were on shore and counted 19-20 orcas in total. They were well spread out, heading north and with J26 leading the way. A female and calf followed quite close behind him (J16 and J42?). A little ways behind these three were another female and, what appeared to be, another calf. The first whales were travelling quite quickly, but as more swam by their behaviours varied: some obvious foraging, several pec and tail slaps, a couple of breaches and one spy hop. Most of the pod were a fair distance offshore so identification was difficult. J1 was seen 1000 metres offshore close to the back of the group. J34 was the only other male that we were able to specifically ID, but at least one other was present. There wasn't a single power or sailboat in sight, well there was one whale watching boat near Oaks Bluff, but it left before J-Pod reached Thieves Bay.

Beam Reach was with
orcas
(likely J pod) today, beginning west of Iceberg Pt, S. Lopez Island (Latitude:48.5302 Longitude:-123.1706) at
1515
, moving W/NW. Their last report was north of Lime Kiln, west San Juan Island at
1642
(Latitude 48.5302 Longitude:-123.1706 ).
*
J pod
, Lime Kiln, 22 members of J pod milling entered the study area heading north at
1516
, leaving the study area at
1605
. These whales were accompanied by two boats in the study area, one a CG cutter, 755 yds. out at
1601
. There were 10 boats accompanying them just outside the study area. 9 tailslaps and 6 cartwheels recorded. Considerable vocalization.

The (
humpback
) whale is still at Pt. Defiance and I got a great look at the underside of his tail. I didn't have my camera but may be able to identify or at least narrow it down through photos. If this worked then I attached a pretty bad drawing of what it looked like, the edges of white were broken towards the end of the tail on the inside. I watched him for about 45 minutes where he came up at least 30 times. Also, I saw him feeding on something at the surface. Before I left he was going in a pretty straight line and surface 7 or 8 times in about a minute then made a tight turn then dived. Just after there was a large disturbance on the surface and then I started seeing him/her reapetly surface in about a 50ft by 50ft area. Got some good views of his pectoral fins as he was turning and breaking the surface in a tight circle. Several birds including an Eagle were right above and a couple Harbor Seals were nearby.

The
humpback
is still hanging around Point Defiance and the southwest side of Vashon Island. I watched him/her on and off between

10:50 AM
and

1:15 PM
spending most of its time about half-way between Vashon and Point Defiance.
