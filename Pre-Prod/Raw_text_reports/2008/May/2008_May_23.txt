Orca Sightings for May 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
48 deg. 42 min. N, 122 deg. 50 min. W. We saw the group of
Orcas
(likely J pod - sb) off Orcas Island between between Clark and Matia Islands at approximately

8:10 am
while we were fishing for Spot Prawns. They were headed south east. It was a wonderful sight for us. The only other time I have spotted Orcas was 2001 off Whidbey Island between Whidbey and Mukilteo.

Early Friday evening from
5PM to
6:30PM
; watched/enjoyed from theatre type setting on a sloping hill, a single
gray whale
. N.E. side of Polnell Point (Oak Harbor) is a half moon bay. Totally calm, as gray kept slowiy cruising along the half moon shoreline. Going one direction, then turning around and going along the half moon bay in opposite direction. Possibly, feeding on something, other, than ghost/sand shrimp. Some, but not much swooshing around as is usually observed, when feeding on shrimp. Maybe, needlefish, as I have seen grays before feeding on needlefish on Crescent Harbor side of Polnell Point.
