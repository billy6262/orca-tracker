Orca Sightings for May 26, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network forwarded photos from a report of a pod of
orcas
off Wadah Island near Neah Bay, WA to Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research, who replied: One of the the bulls, I think, is
T102
.
*
Orca Network received a report from Sarah Miller of 30 to 40
orcas
- appeared to be a very large, spread-out pod, 1/8 mile east of Snow Creek on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, approx 200 yards off beach, traveling west, approx
2 p.m
. They seemed to be playing - lots of breaching, tail- lobbing, spy-hopping, at least one was a large adult male.

It's possible that what we saw was in fact a
Minke
whale and not an Orca. Some others in the Edmonds, Kingston, Bainbridge area have spotted a couple of Minke whales lately. And I guess they also can exhibit the breaching or "porpoising" behavior we saw the other night.

I sighted a pod of
orcas
while I was kayak fishing near
Cape Mendocino CA
today. There were approximately 4-5 females with a at least one very distinct male. Although I did not have a camera at the time, the dorsal fin of the male was very distinctive. It was notched almost as if there were a separate finger-like appendage protruding from the tip. I saw it multiple times and would be able to identify it if you have images of dorsals from males known to frequent northern CA. Time: Approximately
1500
. Location: 40 23' 44.56" N 124 23' 44.56" W, almost on top of "Devil's Gate Rock." The animals did not seem to feeding, maybe playing. The male spy-hopped few times to take a look at us. They were slapping their flukes on the water surface often. They were heading north.

Orca Network received a report from Gerg Barcello, reporting 15
orcas
off Wadah Island, near the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, milling and heading west to Neah Bay, from
3-4 pm
.

1730
off Sooke.

Just letting you know that we left
J pod
at
1940
, and they were about 5 miles south of the entrance to Victoria Harbor, heading east. They were all within a 1/2 mile of each other, travelling slowly east. Seems as though they turned around at about 1400 and headed back east along the coast of southern Vancouver Island. Perhaps we'll see them back around San Juan in the morning. It's 0030 as I write this but I'm not hearing anything on the hydrophones.
A few minutes later: Just as I sent that previous email through I began to hear J pod calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone! It's
12:39am Tues 27th May and I can just hear them over the cargo ship going by.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed a report of
J pod
off Sheringham Pt. (So. Vancouver Island), heading west out of the Strait of Juan de Fuca at about

1:30 pm
.

Read the report this morning of a
humpback
in the area so went down to look around and within 2 min spotted what I believe is a Minke
*
whale between Pt. Defiance and Vashon Island moving back and forth. We watched for about 45 min. then went around the corner more towards the Narrows and did not see anything else.

From the photo above, this is definitely the humpback whale that's been in the area - note the shape of the fin in the photo above (I like to think of a humpback fin and back as looking like a big chocolate chip on the water!) - below is a photo of a Minke whale fin, which has more of a sickle shape.
