Capt. Jim Maya called to report
J pod
1 mile off the east tip of Pt. Roberts at

, heading south down Rosario, maybe toward Boundary Pass.

I'm sure Alison will send you a report of our incredible day, but here's a picture (or two) that pretty well sums up how well it went: (it really is nice to have a big zoom lens so we can see up close while staying our distance!)

We started our trip today with the news that
J-pod
was up at Sandy Point (near Vancouver BC) and heading north. Eventually Ivan said it looks good and off we went to Point Roberts. As we all eagerly searched for dorsal fins alas there was J1. It was almost as if he wanted to make sure we saw him. He logged on the surface for 2 minutes; you could not miss him. He did this a few times before joining up with J26 & J27 for some male bonding.

We headed straight for Point Roberts in hopes of meeting
J-Pod
who was at the coal docks and traveling south towards the Rosario Strait. We got positive ID's on
J-1, J-2, J-16, J-42, J-26, and J-11. J-26
, aka Mike, also breached over five times right in front of us! They were spy hopping, pec slapping, tail lobbing, breaching, and cartwheeling about.

The (
humpback
) whale never did lift its fluke today so we had to settle for photos of the body. We left it at about

3:30pm
, just out front of the ferry terminal at Point Defiance, still milling around in Dalco Passage as it has been reported recently. After pouring over numerous dorsal fin photos of the three individuals that have been identified in the south sound since 2004, we tend to think this whale is new to the area, even though it is similar in appearance to two others seen previously (which is why we prefer to identify humpbacks by their more distinctive flukes, if they are nice enough to show them!). Based on some fairly low-resolution photos, we are reasonably certain it is the same whale photographed in Mutiny Bay on 26 April, though. It is not a very young whale, although I would classify it as a smaller adult. All in all, its skin and body condition look pretty good. It does have a broad, shallow depression just behind the blowhole on the right side of the head, not sure what to make of it, but the whale seems to be doing fine so far otherwise.

After reading the weekend posts on the Pt. Defiance
Humpback
I just went down to see if I could get another look this morning (before

10:30 am
). After about 5 minutes at the first over look on the five mile drive it came up for 4 quick breaths. It was on the Pt. Defiance side and close to shore heading towards Gig Harbor. I was there another 20 minutes or so without anymore sightings.

Derek Woodie called to relay more reports of the
humpback
whale - co-workers saw it at
8 am
from the Vashon ferry, and Derek saw it again at

6:50 pm
off the SW point of Vashon Island.
