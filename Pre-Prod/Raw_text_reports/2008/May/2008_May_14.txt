Orca Sightings for May 14, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was at Marina Beach Park in Edmonds around
8 pm
when I happened to look out at the end of the pier, probably about 400-500 feet away. I saw a
gray
breaking the water in a slow leisurely roll, never showing its tail and heading North. All I saw was the back of its back, starting about a foot in front of the "bumps" and then continuing on through all of the "bumps". (I'm sure they have a proper name, but I'm too lazy right now to look it up). What I saw was probably about 6-10 feet long. It continued on, leaving my sputtering in amazement.

the bumps on a gray whale's back are called "knuckles" - sb

I just got a reply from Graeme on the identity of the
Transient
orca sprouter. He said it was
T73B
and has not been seen for a few years. Also, I have been calling T90's juvenile T90A and I am wrong. I guess T90 did have a previous calf sometime (?) and lost it and her current juvenile is T90B.

Just thought I'd add a little more info about the Transients sighted off Victoria. It seems as though we picked up the T's where Dave Ellifrit left them. We had a 1pm trip and came out of Victoria Harbor and they were approx. 2 miles SW of the Ogden Pt Breakwater. They then hugged the shoreline and swam right up against the breakwater, with one of the individuals rolling over and giving the lucky people walking along the breakwall a nice view of its white underside. It was amazing to see them right at the tip of Ogden Pt at the mouth of Victoria Harbor. They then crossed the mouth of the harbor and headed in a general SW direction towards Albert Head.

Here is a bit more on the
transients
I was out on: I left Snug harbor at 1055-overcast and mostly calm- and got on scene around
1135
just west of the Chain Islets. The eight whales were tight and heading southwest at a medium speed. The whales present were T87, T88, T90, T90A, T124, T124D, T124E, and a sprouter who I don't remember seeing before. I will have to send a picture of him off to Graeme for an I.D. By around 1155, the whales were off the south tip of Trial Island still tight but had slowed down a bit. Most of the whales appeared to be resting but T124E and the sprouter were just slightly off to the side rolling around together. I saw a seasnake from those two that I think belonged to T124E so am pretty confident he is a young male. I left the whales with a couple Victoria boats at
1238
about 2 miles southwest of Trial Island. The whales were still tight and slowly heading southwest.

We traveled all the way to Albert Head, west of Victoria Harbor. J-Pod had traveled too far north, but the
Transients
were in reach. After a super calm journey across the Haro Strait, past Discovery Island, and beyond Victoria Harbor, we made it to our prince charming (a large Transient male). Our guests got some amazing views of the group of 6- 8 Transients, which included multiple females, a juvenile, an unknown sprouter (juvenile male), and an adult male. The orcas appeared to have caught a Harbor Seal because there was an oil slick in the water just behind them and the sea gulls were going nuts, diving in and out of the water. The orcas gave us some fabulous views as they surfaced just off Albert Point, providing the perfect backdrop for photos.

6-8
Transient orca
picked up near Trial Isle are seen here 2 NM NNW of Albert Head,
1420hr
. Observed again around 1615hr 0.3 NM offshore William Head. Left them last
1630hr
0.5 NM North of Race Pass heading for the passin ebb current. I'm still reading the survey (thnx Big Blue) so I only have T87 ID'd.

We found
J-Pod
coming through Active Pass at

1:15 p.m
. We had heard that they were near Enterprise Reef up at the top of Swanson's Channel, so our route today took us to the east entrance of Active Pass in the Strait of Georgia. We decided to wait in Miner Bay and as soon as we settled in, we sighted a huge breach as the lead whale came "around the bend" in Active Pass. Most of the whales stuck close to the north side of the pass, with a few stops for foraging off the ferry landing. We floated along in the current, watching as what must have been the entire family, picked up speed and moved on, out into the Strait of Georgia. Ruffles and Granny went way up to the north, an outer escort of two? The rest of J-Pod moved along in smaller sub pod groups, stopping to tail slap, pec slap, do a few belly rolls, and then continue on across toward the Fraser River. As we left, about

2:15 p.m
., I noticed J-26, Mike, as he stopped to do a fast turn around, some foraging behavior, and then onward toward the river.

I've heard we had
transients
out today, and
J-Pod
was heading back north up Swanson, and through Active Pass.
