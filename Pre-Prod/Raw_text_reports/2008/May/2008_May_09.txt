Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research found
J pod
spread out at mid-day (

12:12-
3:56 p.m.
) heading north in Haro Strait. All accounted for, except J43 who has been missing all of this year and is presumed dead.

At

5:30pm
, flying in a small plane at 3000 ft I saw about 4 whales. One looked about 2/3s the size of the others. They were stationary. Not Orcas. Maybe grey? From my point of view they looked white. Location was between 1 mile south of Camano Island State park.

J's
are back and all present except J43 (
as noted in an earlier report - unfortunately this new J pod calf was last seen and photographed Nov. 24th off Whidbey Island - sb
). They looked fat and healthy yesterday, but were very spread out.
