Orca Sightings for May 18, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The "mystery" whale (that's yesterday's minke-like mystery whale, not the humpback off Pt. Defiance), IS exactly what I saw on Sunday morning,
May 18,
10:41AM near the ferry line, between the Duwamish Head, Alki Point & Smith Cove Marina. (Although, there were 3!, one considerably larger than the other 2.) My guess is that they were Minkes? We maintained sight of them for about 15 minutes and got several good looks @ each via kayak.

Attached is a photo taken last weekend off of Seattle, just north of the Winslow/Seattle Ferry lane about in the middle of the Sound. This whale was swimming toward my boat and I saw it from about 250 yards away. I stopped / engine off and waited. The animal surfaced next to me heading 180 degrees to my course, about fifty feet to starboard. I was struck by the long body (maybe 35 - 40 feet) the flat back between the blow hole (sorry I know little whale terminology) and the mid back. It glided for about 1.5 - 2.5 seconds and then dove slowly. In diving it displayed it's small dorsal fin, but the tail didn't break the surface. Interesting fact was that the exhaled breath stank like a room full of herring (we were down wind of the whale). Standing at water level I could not see the underwater parts as the sun was to one side and therefore couldn't confirm diagonal strips on the side fins. My guess is that it was a Minke whale. Does the back and fin look compatible with that? I've boated for forty years in Puget Sound and the SJ's, this whale definitely seemed very different from female Orca and Dahl's porpoises. I once saw a similar whale in the middle of the Straits of Juan de Fuca but that was from a long way away. I appreciate any response.

This does look like a minke, but minkes only get to about 26-28' long, so does that seem possible? It could be a juvenile fin whale if it's 35-40 feet, but they are pretty rare around here. Anyone have a diagnosis? -hg

While sailing between Point Defiance Park and Vashon Island (Area 11 of Puget Sound) during the
mid-afternoon
I observed a large whale. The whale appeared to be dark blue or black in color, blew water high into the air several times, and circled the area for the hour I observed it. I believe the whale was a
Humpback
, but I am not an expert at whale identification. In any event, I was able to take a few photos of the whale's dorsal fin. I'm sure anyone aboard the Vashon Ferry the afternoon of
May 18th also saw this whale.

Re: "lone Gray Whale" off East Pt. I was in my kayak around

6:15
along Bells Beach heading toward a boat in the cove, when all of the sudden, "WHhoooosh!" a gray whale exhaled right off my shoulder very close to shore heading south! I nearly jumped out of my kayak! I thought it looked like a calf and raced out deeper (gray being shoreside) to give it some room. I was also bracing for an adult, but it was alone- definitely a gray with the white crab patches/barnacles. The boat took off, probably thinking I was coming to report it, but they must have seen my surprise. Of course, I didn't have my camera.

We encountered what were probably the same two
grey whales
reported by others around Mukilteo/Clinton ferry route on our way north in the morning.

We saw a full tail on the
9am
ferry out of Clinton. It was 30-40 feet right in front of my eyes on the starboard side of the ferry. Not sure if it was a grey or orca. They made an announcement on the ferry. It only happened once and we did not see other whales.

Boating off Northeast of Point Defiance, at about

1:45 PM
observed at least one
whale
. This appeared to be a large whale, black with small dorsal fin and seemed to be traveling North from just West of the Gig Harbor entrance to the Southern tip of Vashon Island.

J-Pod
had been seen just around Alden Bank at the top of Rosario Strait. Once in Rosario, we noticed that the J's were spread out from side-to-side in a swath of maybe 1 to 1 1/2 miles across. It was so cool to see J22 Oreo traveling with her two kids Doublestuff (J34) and Cookie. J34 was feeling mighty frisky as he did several half-breaches, and one very large breach that had him completely out of the water. The big surprise of the day came when we were watching a small group of orcas and I noticed a
minke
whale swimming amongst the orcas. We last left the whales just at the northern end of Bellingham Channel.

At
5AM
a report came into our Hotline about
orcas
Heading North off Point Roberts. At
0645
I saw the end of some
orcas
moving fast Heading South off the Point. So did I miss Js? No. At
0845
a large number of
orcas
were also Heading South. This time some breaches 100 feet off shore. While Watch Watch Companies first found
Js
at Alden Bank at
1145
I was miles north of them with other
Js
. They all went into Rosario and I left them spread out in calm waters just East of Java Rocks at
1645
.

On my way over on the

9:00
ferry from Mukleteo to Clinton I saw 2
gray whales
spouting and moving slowly. I was able to see them again from the beach after I got off the ferry. They were close enough to the shore that I could hear them spouting. When I saw them on the beach they were between the beach and the ferry as the ferry traveled back to Mukleteo.

We enjoyed seeing a lone

5:30 -
6:30 this morning
.

11:30 am
, we had just rounded Point Defiance coming from the south. Big blow from an
unknown whale
, though certainly not an Orca. We would estimate @ 1/3 mile off shore to the north of Point Defiance. We were approximately 75 yards north of the whale when it first blew. Estimate 20-30 feet long. Solitary as far as we could tell. Worked its way south around the point.

The lone humpback has been seen in the same location recently. -hg

1:30-
2:30 ish p.m. - J pod

We headed out from Victoria across to the Haro Strait and approx. a couple of miles SE of Kelp Reef, at
1345
, we just happen to come acrosss 2 lone
Transients
, one identified as T20 (and the other T21?). We proceeded to observe them as they headed north, and left them with other WW boats off the east side of Sidney Island at around
1445
.
