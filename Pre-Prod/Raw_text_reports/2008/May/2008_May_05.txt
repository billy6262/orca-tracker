Orca Sightings for May 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call this morning from Chris Peterson, reporting a sighting of
orcas
off the N. end of Texada Island, B.C Gulf Islands. There were at least 3 orcas, near Rebecca Rock, observed from
11-
11:30 am
.
*
1204 hr - 1300hr
. Bull orca T20 and (another T?) spotted in 3 ft. seas (4 ft. and building by the time we left the animals) approx. 2 NM offshore of Sooke Bluffs (Eastern entrance to Sooke Basin) at
1204hr
. Current was a strong flood at Race Rocks but, further west and offshore, there was still a river of ebb current that the Westbound Transients sought out and rode West (of course dragging us into more exciting seas as time wore on). Left the animals near 1300hr approaching Otter Pt., still 2 plus NM offshore. Behaviour: 3-4 min dives between 3-4 minute "surfacings" (time near surface). No apparent hunting; animals traveling 4-6 Kn. (S.O.G).
