Orca Sightings for May 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
This was an amazing evening for
gray whales!
I thought they had finished feeding here NW of Langley but, at about

5:30 PM
we heard a whale breathe and then accompanying splashing of a whale close into shore feeding. Sure enough it was Patch. He stayed for almost an hour and then suddenly took off very fast to the southeast. He was shallow and literally left a wake. We watched him head out to deeper water toward Camano Head and then at

6:30 PM
we saw another whale blow off in the distance. The two whales met almost mid channel between Langley and Camano Island. They spent about 15- 20 minutes sort of milling about. At
6:50 they began to head back to the NW and
7:00 PM both whales were feeding side by side NW of Langley. They continued to work their way to the NW feeding and then swimming out to deeper water, then back in to feed. We thought they had left but at
8:30 PM they were back NW of Langley. At
9:45 PM they were still here feeding. It was wonderful to see them again!

A repeat performance of the day before, a large
Gray
was feeding close to shore at

6:30 am
just north of Kayak point, moving north toward Warm Beach (Port Susan). Don't know ID's but saw two brushstroke-like markings on either the top of left fluke or bottom of right fluke.

Another report of
T20
and (apparently) T21 -- same place (Eastern entrance to Sooke Basin) , close to the same time, in fact 50 hours later. Animals were almost exactly on top of the point where I had marked them on
May 05. Time of sighting was

15:42
and seas were 6ft.-plus at in a roaring flood current.
