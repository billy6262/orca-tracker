We had the pleasure of having one
gray whale
spend from at least

5:30 PM
through past
midnight
(!!) in the shallow ghost shrimp beds close in in front of our community south of the Mabana Rd. (west Camano Island). Having such a large creature so close for so long was an unforgettable experience for us, and especially for our company. Usually the whales don't linger, but feed as they are passing by. There was the usual lying over on it's side with pec fin and tail fluke up, but there also seemed to be an unusual amount of sidewise tail thrashing.

Caitlin and her Dad called Orca Network to report 3-4
orcas
off Pt. Arena, CA at
noon
, heading north. There was one adult male fin observed.

We headed out from Gig Harbor in our boat late this
afternoon
. Between Point Dalco and Vashon Island, we spotted the
humpback
reported earlier and spent an hour watching in the same area, as he/she was slowly circling and doing all the things whales do.

Extraordinary ballet of
J Pod
today off Salmon Bank. J-Pod reported north bound near Cyprus Island, seen off the ferry around

7:00p.m.
this evening. Report called in by Mary Masters on her return home ferry trip, after winter. She works for Monterey Aquarium, is a volunteer for the MRC also works for Orcas Island Eclipse Charters as a naturalist.

We had an incredible day with
J Pod
today! The afternoon was spent off South Beach watching five [
orcas
] as they headed south and toward Salmon Bank Buoy. They did a lot of traveling south, then foraging and heading out into Haro Strait, only to turn and work back toward the beach. These were all
J Pod
females and youngsters. On our evening trip we found
J Pod
, grouped up and traveling around the south eastern tip of Lopez Island. The question was, will they go across Rosario and toward Deception Pass? Or up Rosario Strait? The whales got really active as they rounded the tip of Lopez. Then they split a little into sub groups, and yes! They headed up Rosario Strait! There were many tail slaps, a few breaches, some spy hopping, then more speedy travel. Ruffles had quite a crowd around him as he majestically came to the surface, and then slowly disappeared - going down, down, down. Another sub group with Polaris, J-28 was on the flank. On this surprisingly warm afternoon - evening it was such a pleasure to watch the whole family head north with good energy. It was easy to spot J-26, J-30, J-19, J-41, as well as J-16 and J-42. We left the J's at Bird Rocks in Rosario Strait at

6:35 p.m.
and headed back to the west to Friday Harbor.

J-Pod
was foraging on the southwest side (near salmon bank) and we got an incredible show. The sun was shining, the air was warm, the sea was calm, and J-Pod was active! The Sea Lion began our encounter watching three females, but then turned closer to shore to be with the Kittiwake and a group of orcas they were observing. J-28, J-26, J-14, and J-42 were all confirmed in this group and just as we were approaching the Kittiwake an orca exploded out of the water in one of the closest breaches we've had yet! The whale conveniently jumped about 115 yards off the port side of the Kittiwake and about 150 yards in front of the Sea Lion!!! We believe it was J-26 who breached, but it happened so suddenly that we didn't get the greatest look at who it was. J-Pod has been good to us lately and we send them many thanks for such a great show!

Coming from Quartermaster Hbr. around

12:30
today we observed a large
humpback
working the current rips on the ebb. The whale would surface and breathe 3 or 4 times before sounding for 10 min. or so
