Orca Sightings for May 8, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
While we were in Coupeville looking for the Gray whale in Penn Cove today, we met some folks who relayed a sighting of two
orcas
in Penn Cove on
May 8th at

6:30 pm
in front of the Mad Crab Restaurant.

We had reports in the Strait of Georgia of 15-20
killer whales
off Entrance Island, Nanaimo, heading NW, and 8+
killer whales
(6+ adults and at least 2 calves) off Powell River, heading N.

A friend of ours had stayed the night in his boat there and his Uncle was with him. His Uncle told us he was up late and heard a [
gray
] whale feeding nearby for a long time. He said it sounded very large. He could hear the blow sounds and the feeding sounds. Anyway, that was late into the night right next to the Langley Marina.

Just a quick report that I heard a few
transient
calls between about

11:50 and midnight
PDT on OrcaSound. The first couple were very loud and squawky -- at first I thought it was a great blue heron getting surprised and eaten by something! The subsequent calls were spaced a few minutes apart, rapidly grew fainter, and sounded like transient calls.

Heard a
Gray
feeding and blowing tonight at

9:30 pm
near the shore off Edgecliff, just west of Sandy Point.

5:30 PM
- Saw large
gray
whale off of Langley 100 yards out traveling SE. Later -
6:30 pm, walking along the Langley waterfront we saw what appeared to be mother and child off of the Camano Island side.

At

5:30 PM
a
gray
whale swam by from northwest to the southeast past NW Langley. The tide was still pretty far out and the whale was just past the drop off doing deep dives and showing its fluke. The whale stopped in front of Langley at about
5:45 and in fifteen minutes it had sky hopped three times! That's the first time I'd seen a whale spy hop- it was wonderful. Of course I did not have my camera, by the time I had it the whale was headed to the SE (
6:05 PM), I got one shot of its back and I think it is whale # 723.

We were on the 1 pm Mukilteo/Clinton ferry, and saw a whale watch boat and two spouts off Camano Head from about
1-
1:15 pm
. We drove over to Sandy Pt. south of Langley, to discover the two [
gray
] whales (and the boat, giving the whales lots of room) had moved south and were off the west side of Hat/Gedney Island. They were feeding VERY close to the shoreline! We watched them from

1:40 -
1:50 pm, they seemed to be slowly heading south as they fed.

We have had two
greys
off our beach on Edgecliff Drive, Langley, just west of Sandy Point for about 90 minutes (
8-
8:30 am
) at this writing. Appears to be a female with a youngster.
Dan Prewitt, Edgecliff Drive, Langley
Note - according to Cascadia Research, the local whales that feed in Saratoga Passage tend to be adult males rather than females with calves. However, one of the whales is smaller, and is often mistaken for a calf -sb

About

3:45 pm
I spotted what looked like a
minke
heading north bout 1/4 mile south of Point Wells (near Edmonds). It was about 1/4 mile off the beach. I saw it surface twice so got a pretty good look at it thru the glasses.
Dan Leyde, Richmond Beach

I believe I saw a
Minke
whale. I saw the rear portion with the small dorsal fin as it rose out of the water. It was much smaller than an orca or a gray whale. Black or dark gray. I saw it just north of Rolling Bay on Bainbridge Island, and just south of Faye Bainbridge State Park. It was about 150 yards off-shore, travling north along the shoreline at

11:15 am
.
