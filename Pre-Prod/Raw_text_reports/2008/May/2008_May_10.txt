Orca Sightings for May 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Center for Whale Research reports
J pod
was off the Fraser River entrance, and almost to Lion's Gate Bridge in Vancouver by
nightfall
.
*
Single
Gray whale
visited us approximately
1 PM
. Moving east along the southern edge of Gedney/Hat island. Probably 150 yards offshore, surfaced within 50 feet of our boat -- quite a show and surprise!

J Pod
off Fraser River, Strait of Georgia. We located J Pod at approximately

11:30 AM
, offshore of the Fraser River. They were headed south at the time, and very spread out. They did a few directional changes in the time that boats were with them, and were last seen on our second outing at approximately

3:30 PM
, heading Northwest from Point Grey, Vancouver. We observed several foraging lunges, and lots of pursuit behaviour, so hopefully they were finding lots to eat.

off of Arroyo Beach in W Seattle, moving quickly to the south toward 3 tree point. Maybe 50 yds offshore. Couldn't get the camera fast enough to catch it fluking.

I looked out our office window this morning, picked up my binoculars, and immediately spotted a spout out in Saratoga Passage!! One
Gray whale
was mid-channel, closer to the Camano Island side, heading north at a pretty good pace at

11:25 am
. I first saw it just north of Camano Island State Park.

Windwalker Taibi called Orca Network at
10 am
to report two
Gray whales
coming in to the beach at East Pt (Saratoga Psg, near entrance to Holmes Harbor). There were some kayakers nearby. Then emailed us this update: Well, the two grays that we saw turned out to be three. They moved off pretty fast, so we didn't get pictures. We did get a look at one that was a much lighter color then any Gray I've seen before. Maybe it was the lighting, but I don't think so. The kayakers I mentioned in my phone call are definitely a bit of a problem. They just don't have a clue about the law. But, lots of folks were yelling at them from the shore, so I hope they got the point. Have a great weekend - what a treat!
