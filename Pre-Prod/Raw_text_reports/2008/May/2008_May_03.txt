Orca Sightings for May 3, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just received a few more pictures and details about last Saturday's orca sighting in Newport.
Jim Rice, Newport OR: Last Saturday I stepped out on to our balcony and saw a big dorsal fin then a couple more. I counted 5 total. One big, three medium and one smaller. They were circling and splashing in the area shown in the photos (see above). We could hear them blow as they came up. I did not see the seals, but one man said that there were a couple of seals in the middle of them. There were 3 other seals that were up hiding up on the rocks on shore. We took the 3 pics from the balcony. I headed down to get pics close up, but by the time I got there the orcas were headed back out toward the ocean.

There was a report by at least 3-5 people that on opening day of shrimping season they saw a
killer whale
eating a sea lion just north of Ayock Beach. It happened about

8:45
. I did not see it.

We received several photos of the Orcas reported Saturday morning in the Yaquina River,
Newport OR
, along with an additional report (which leaves no doubt that they were
Transients
!).
From Jim Rice: I've received this additional piece of information about Saturday's orca sighting: "I was out at S. Jetty this evening and ran into a young man walking the road who saw the orcas kill at least one harbor seal this morning. He lives near the start of the S. Jetty road. He thought there were 5 orcas, and they killed the seal on the south side between the bridge and the finger jetty. Barry"

Orca Network shared Angi's photos (which weren't great ID shots, but one had some saddle patches) with researchers, and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research replied: I will go way, way out on a limb here and take a GUESS that this MIGHT be T49C and T50. The fin shape is right and I think I can believe that I see nicks where they should be. I believe both of those whales have been photographed down that direction before too. Other than that, I can't say for sure!

Heard it through the grapevine that a group of
Orcas
was supposedly going through Active Pass.

We observed single
gray whale
pass through Mariner's Cove (near Strawberry Point) and feed very close along the shoreline at
7PM
Saturday evening. A lot of swirling around with flippers exposed for 15/20 minutes before heading south towards Polnell Point.

Our first whale sighting began at

12:12
- The small/juvenile
Humpback
NE of Possession Pt. (N 47' 54.195 W 122' 21.995). The whale was traveling south bound, taking two to three breaths before diving. The sighting ended at
12:27, the whale did not fluke. Our next sighting began at

13:07
- 2
grays
moving SSW of the dolphin day marker E of Gedney Island (N 48'00.268 W 122'15.863). Then a third Gray whale spotted at
13:15. All three whales were foraging in the shallows, with pectorals and flukes out of the water. One whale was #49. We left the whales at
13:35

Orca Network received a call from Dave Metz of
Newport, OR
at

10:10 am
, he was observing 3
orcas
swimming up the Yaquina River in Newport. They went 200-300 yards upriver, nearly to the Newport Bridge, then turned & were starting to swim back down river. He referred Angie to us, who was nearby watching the orcas - she first saw the orcas at
10:00 am as she was driving over the Newport bridge. She followed them along the jetty and took some photos which she will send to us. It is likely these are
Transient
orcas looking for a seal or two.

Orca Network received a call from Kwasi Addae of Salish Sea Charters at

12:15 pm
, with a report of the juvenile
humpback
that's been hanging around lately. It was off Possession Pt, South Whidbey Island.
