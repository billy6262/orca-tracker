Orca Sightings for May 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lisa Schlender and I headed out of Westport for one of our monthly outer coast marine mammal surveys. We found a
gray whale
with a very small calf right off the north jetty of Grays Harbor, lots of
harbor porpoises
within about 5 miles of shore, several small groups of Dall's porpoise offshore, and four
humpbacks
, including one calf, about 10 miles off Westport.
