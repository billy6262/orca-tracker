Orca Sightings for October 3, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out SE of Victoria on the OM and saw three
Humpback
whales at
three pm.
These were ID'd by Mark Malleson as BCYOI60, BCYO342 and the two year old calf BCZO298. The young calf breached which was a great surprise.

Brian Peterson called Orca Network at

12:50 pm
, reporting a whale just south of Lagoon Pt, about 1/3 of the way out in Admiralty Inlet. His description of the dorsal fin, the blow, and the fact that it fluked when it dove, seem to indicate this was a
humpback
whale (maybe the same one in the report & photo from our Sept. 30 report?). He said it was headed south toward Bush Pt, then turned more to the west, toward Marrowstone Island.
