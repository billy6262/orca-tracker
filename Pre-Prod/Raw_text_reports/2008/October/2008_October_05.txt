Orca Sightings for October 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mary Ann Deuth called Orca Network to report 1
gray whale
in Crescent Bay, west of Port Angeles from 4 - 6 pm.

We had the
T41's and T44
today at Beacher Bay. They had made several kills prior to the Ocean Magic arriving so we had three full orca around with one dragging kelp over its fluke. They were in no hurry to go anywhere even when more sea lions entered the Bay. A most enjoyable commune with these top predators. Later we saw possibly the same three
Humpback
whales we had seen yesterday south of Victoria and east of Race Rocks.
