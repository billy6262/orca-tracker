Orca Sightings for October 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I thought I would send you a photo of
K42
in
Rosario Strait
. This was during his multi-breach session while he was swimming along with K26. In this photo you can see him doing a breach that looked much like a back flip. I took the photograph from the Island Explorer 3.

Between
11 pm and about
12:15 a.m.
it sounded like
K Pod
was traveling down the west side. I listened to the
Lime Kiln Hydrophones
, then called a friend to the south and she listened to their blows from the shore, as they passed by in Haro Strait. Here's another picture from Sunday of K-42, showing us his belly. When he was with big brother Lobo (K-26), the breaching would be happening, that's where so many of us got lucky to get those belly shots! A couple times, when Lobo would dive, just seconds later K-42 would burst through the surface - looked like some kind of play behavior maybe! Then K-42 would surface with mom for a while and the breaching activity would no longer happen.

At
1610
hrs., we encountered a very spread out
K-pod and L-87
,
1.5nm Northeast of the Peapod Islands in Rosario Strait
. The whales were foraging the entire time spent on scene (lots of eco- location on the hydrophone). The Orcas were traveling Northeast against the current heading towards Village Pt., Lummi Island. We left them at
1720
hrs., 2nm Northeast of Lawrence Point, Orcas Island. Also, we heard a second hand report from Simon (Ocean Ecoventures) that
J-pod
(approx. 30 whales) was seen today up in Campbell River (Cape Mudge) headed South.

K-Pod!!!
After wandering off for a week, K-Pod showed up in Rosario Strait heading north. As we sat and waited for the whales to make their way towards us, we noticed they were spread nearly shore-to-shore in Rosario. Our first sighting was of K25 Lobo, traveling with K42. And this lead to a very exciting discovery by us---K42 is a BOY!!!! He must have breached 24 times or more while we observed him. The first few breaches were with his back to us. The whales were also traveling with honorary K-Pod member L-87, who has been seen with the K's most of the summer. On our trip home, we heard a report that
J-Pod
had been spotted near the Campbell River, so perhaps they will be in the San Juans in the next 48 hours--keep your eyes and ears open!
