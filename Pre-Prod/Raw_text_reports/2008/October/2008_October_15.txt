Orca Sightings for October 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had 2
humpbacks
2.5 miles
SW Constance Bank
doing circles all day, also the
T-46's
feeding all day off
William Head, Victoria B.C
. They were picked up at
1030
and remained within the same 3 mile square all day. During the 2 trips I drove out of Victoria we witnessed 4 harbour seal (probable) kills in the A.M then 6 harbour seal (probable) kills plus an attack on a lone Steller Sea lion leaving it injured and bleeding from it's back and mouth. Hungry today guys? They were left 2 miles East of William Head finishing off a meal at
1730
.
Brenden, Wild West, Seafun Safaris
