Orca Sightings for October 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
On our
1pm
Zodiac run we found the
Grey Whale
that had been reported earlier, at
Crescent Beach Washington State
. It was a rather small whale that lazily exhailed two to three plumes of mist before arching its back slowly to show the 'knuckles' along the top of the tail stock. No sign of 'fluking' which would have been nice. The colour of the water in this area was an intense sea green. Amazing.

1550 hrs.
, we observed most of
K-pod and L-87
traveling South in
Open Bay
. The K-14's (Lea's Group) were in the lead traveling quickly and close to the San Juan Island shoreline. At this point, K-11 (Georgia), the new matriarch of the group was trailing behind and hanging out with L-87 (Onyx). We followed the whales until about
1650
hrs. at which point they started heading offshore from
Pile Pt
. We broke off contact 1.3 nm offshore of False Bay as the whales were still headed Southeast at this point. We had great sightings and vocals with the K-14's today and both K-pod sprouters, K-25 (Scoter) and K- 26 (Lobo), were playing around with L-87 (Onyx) near the end of our stay. I did not see K-40 or K-21 today or on Sunday in Rosario Strait.

Our trip today took us north for wildlife viewing, as the last reports of
K pod
were that they were headed west and going out the
Strait
. At
2 p.m
. we got word of one orca fin headed north along the west side of San Juan Island! By
2:15 we saw many K pod whales, all traveling north going along at a good clip! We were able to ID Lobo, K-26, K-14, K-36, K-25 as we wound up turning and paralleling the whales. We joined them south of Open Bay and continued back north until we went around Kellet Bluff. We left the whales, still traveling north at
3:20 and there were big blows coming north from the south. We heard later on the radio that the whales had turned and were headed back south by

3:40 p.m.
This was another amazing day, where the surprise of seeing the whales again, after deciding maybe they had truly "gone out" for the season, ended in a very magical and appreciated time.

13:48
-
S16 calls
(K pod?) on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
. Lots of loud ships moving around nearby - Chum salmon fishers?
1427
- Hearing S16s on Orcasound hydrophone - K pod heading north, fast. No purse seiners around at the moment, so good recording will be up later at Orca Sound.
1530
- Many calls and great clicks, buzzes, and percussive activity now on
Orcasound hydrophone
. Maybe they turned around and are headed south now?

At around

1:50 pm
we began hearing some calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
. We listened for about 10 minutes & they faded away, then later heard calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone. We tuned into the Center for Whale Research's
OrcaCam
at about

3:40 pm
and saw orcas, now heading south off west San Juan Island, and at 4 pm heard calls again off Lime Kiln.
