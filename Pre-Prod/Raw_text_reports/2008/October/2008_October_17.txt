Orca Sightings for October 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The trip on the Ocean Magic took us south of Race Rocks today, where we saw
T20 and T21
. They were taking very long dives and being elusive. Luckily along came the the
T2's
which helped keep us occupied during the long waits between surfacing of the other two.

Approximately
1600
hrs.,
3.7nm SW of Trial Island
we picked up two groups of
Transients
which were headed in an Easterly direction.
T-20 & T-21
were traveling together and about 600 yards to the Southwest were some of the
T2's. T2, T2C, T2C1 and T2C2
, specifically. We spent about 45 minutes with both groups and left them at
1645
hrs., 2.6nm South of Seabird Point (Discovery Island) heading Northeast towards False Bay. The whales were traveling quickly, 6-7 kts., often surfing down the waves as they headed for San Juan Island. We saw no surface activity, it seemed that they were just in traveling mode.
