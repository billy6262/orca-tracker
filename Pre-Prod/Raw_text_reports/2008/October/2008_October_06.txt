Orca Sightings for October 6, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we had the good fortune to see one of the largest cetaceans that visit the area--
humpbacks
! Not just one or two, but five humpbacks! We had to travel quite a ways west (nearly to
Race Rocks
), but the trip was definitely worth it. The whales were in mostly in one group of four, with a lone individual traveling a short ways behind them. As the larger group came to the surface, they would sit on the surface for almost a minute at time, touching each other and letting out huge exhalations. The largest individual's breaths were so incredibly loud. After viewing orcas all summer, it was hard to grasp the size difference on these amazing creatures. At one point, one whale turned sideways and extended a 10-12 foot pectoral fin and let it flop down on the water (and the back of the nearest whale). We watched this group for about 30 minutes or so before heading back. As we passed Discovery Island, we had a
Minke
whale show up as well. But nature had one more rare treat for us--
Dall's Porpoise
near Turn Island! These guys were moving full tilt (about 35 mph for you land- lubbers) with huge rooster tails, and about 3-4 of the 8 porpoises rode our bow for 3-4 minutes before returning to feeding mode.
