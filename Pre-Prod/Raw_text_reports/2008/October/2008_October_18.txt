Orca Sightings for October 18, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At Approximately
1615
hrs.,
T-20 and T-21
were seen traveling West
4.5nm Southeast of Otter Pt
. About 1/2 mile to the Southwest, were the
T2's, (T2, T2C, T2C1 and T2C2)
also headed West in a tight resting pattern. Later in the tour at approx.
1730
hrs. we came across the T46B's and the T49A's right in Pedder Bay. They were in a tight formation doing long dives (4-6 minutes). After surfacing from one of the long dives, one of the T46B's spyhopped with a full grown Harbour Seal in its mouth. (totally intact, but limp). We left the scene at 1800 hrs., as the group of 46B's and 49A's continued West from Race Rocks.

Today we encountered around six
transients
about
three miles west of Moss Landing CA
hunting sea lions. If I took this picture a second earlier you would be able to see the sea lion in the whale's mouth! We watched the pod hunt and kill one, possibly two sea lions when we saw two humpbacks approaching from the other side of our boat. Once the humpbacks got close, they dove under our boat and reappeared in the middle of all the killer whales. They hung around for about 15 minutes until they trailed off.

We encountered
T20 and T21
on our first Zodiac trip out this
morning
. We found them
south of Oak Bay Flats
foraging slowly. The afternoon trip at
2 pm
provided us with more Transient observations.
T46's and T49's
were swimming along with their little ones off William Head. Further out west past Race Rocks, we found T20 and 21 again as well as the
T2's
. Looks like every one was eventually heading out west.
