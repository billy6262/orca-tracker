Orca Sightings for October 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
Transients
once again. These animals were seen by the Ocean Magic trip at noon off
Bentinck Island in Metchosin
, west of Victoria . They were the T 49's and T 36's. A total of six Orca, four T49's and two of the T36's, T 36A and T36A1. It truly is the year of the Transient. They made at least two kills beneath the surface during the time we saw them.

I was just down at Fort Casey on Whidbey Island and observed three groups of
orcas
moving north in Admiralty inlet. The first group consisted of at least 7 (possibly more) orcas with at least one large fin seen in this group. They were only about 100 yards offshore, clearly visible from the bluff I was walking on. They were moving north fairly fast, with the male "porpoising" through the water at times. This group was followed about 150 yards back by at least one large male. Farther out in the passage towards Port Townsend, I saw two more groups of orcas, separated by about 1/2 mile from each other, and each consisting of 4 whales, also moving north, though not as quickly as the first group. One of the whales in the middle group performed several fantastic breaches, visibly completely out of the water before splashing back down in a huge spray. About ten minutes later I saw more breaching farther to the north but could not tell if this was the same group or not. Sighting was about

2:45 - 3 pm
.

Finn Gatewood called Orca Network to report a pod of about 6
orcas
heading north past
Bush Pt. off west Whidbey Island
at

1:15 pm
. At
1:25 pm she reported they were not quite to Lagoon Pt., traveling mid-channel with some tail slapping, and she was now seeing more whales.

Deb Wenthin called Orca Network at

1:24 pm
to report 8+ orcas heading north past
Bush Pt
, between Bush Pt. & Lagoon Pt. closer to the Whidbey/Bush Pt. side , of the Inlet.

After receiving Finn's call, we headed out to get some ID shots of the whales. We launched from Ft. Casey State Park at
2:25 pm, saw some porpoise at
2:30 pm right off the park, then at
2:40 saw some whale spouts just north of Lagoon Pt, west Whidbey Island (48 07.823N, 122 39.150W). The whales were in at least 2 groups, one closer to Whidbey, the other mid- channel, mainly heading north with some direction changes as they looked like they were doing some foraging. We stayed with the group mid-channel for a bit and confirmed it was
K pod
, with
L 87
still traveling with them. At

3:10 pm
we were with a group that was spread out and closer to the Port Townsend side of Admiralty Inlet. We caught up to the group closer to the Whidbey side at
3:30 pm near Ebey's Landing, by 4 pm they were off Ft. Ebey State Park off Partridge Bank (48 13.052N, 122 46.504 W). The whales were tightly grouped at this point, doing some interesting social behavior - spy hops, rolling over, and bringing their heads up out of the water together in a circle - interesting behaviors! We left them at
4:10 pm as they were heading toward mid-channel from Partridge Bank, with a few other orcas spread out on the other side of the channel, and saw a few more porpoise as we headed back.
