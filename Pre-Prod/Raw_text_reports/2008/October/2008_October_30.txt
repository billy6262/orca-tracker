Orca Sightings for October 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1700
hrs., as we were traveling West to Race Rocks we found two
Humpback
whales 2.2 nm due East of
Race Rocks Lighthouse
. The pair of HB's were swimming in large concentric circles and were deep diving (8 min. dives). They were feeding on a large herring ball because all around at the surface were hundreds of Auklets, Murres and Gulls. We had flat calm water today with little to no boats anywhere out in the Strait.

At
1500
hrs. we came across a very spread out
L-pod
about 8.5 nm Southwest of Hein Bank. The whales were spread over 5-8 nm East to West as there were boats with the whales just South of Hein Bank at this time. The direction of travel was Southeast bound towards
Port Townsend
. Great vocalizations with the western group which consisted mostly of L-pod. After about 20 minutes of viewing L-pod, we continued to the East. 1.8 nm South of the Romeo Buoy, we encountered most of
J-pod
with some of the
K's
mixed in. Lots of surface activity and vocals with this Eastern group as well. We did not see the L-12's anywhere today? We left scene at
1615
hrs. approximately 2 nm Northeast of Dungeness Spit, whales were still traveling Southeast.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to confirm that yes,
J, K and L pods
were all present today. They saw whales headed south off the west side of the island this morning (J's & L's), very spread out. They went out to do a survey, and K pod joined J & L pods in the afternoon. They left them around
3 pm
, west of Hein Bank, heading south.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report
J pod
off San Juan Island at

10:30 am
, heading south from Lime Kiln State Park. He called with an update at

3:45 pm
to report it was J's & L's heading down San Juan Island this morning, then J, K & L pod this afternoon heading south toward Dungeness.

I am hearing what sounds to be
J pod
on
Orcasound
hydrophone, now, at

9:50am
, some faint calls and clicks.

11:40 am
- I am again hearing faint calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
- cannot quite make out who is there, likely J's since they passed by there an hour and a half or so ago?
