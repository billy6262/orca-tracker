Orca Sightings for October 31, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am on the Seaspan Champion returning from a trip to Kitimat. On the way up we had a several
Humpback
sightings. The first was in Blackfish Sound near Alert Bay. A little further on (while I was asleep unfortunately, we had a number of them breaching and sounding a little ways off the tug.

I was taking the
port townsend to keystone
ferry Halloween at

2:15 p.m.
A large group of
orcas
were spotted by the captain-I couldn't keep track of how many animals, but my fellow boat-mates and I estimate 20-30. They were heading west out the straits and there were several adults who were jumping and clearing the water and doing twists and flips. I also saw at least 2 babies.

Thought you might enjoy this quick blog entry that presents a 5 minute clip from the midnight recording made as killer whales passed
Port Townsend
(very early morning Halloween day). If any of you have heard this sort of call repetition (~40 S19s).

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported hearing
L pod calls
on the
Pt. Townsend hydrophone
at

12:20 am
, likely heading south.
*
Lots and lots of clear
S19 calls
on
Port Townsend hydrophone
just
after midnight
on Halloween morning. Don't think I've ever heard S19 repeated so often and steadily. Still hearing calls now

12:27

12:45 PM
Halloween: 12-15
Orcas
went by the end of Adams road (S.
Bush Pt, W.Whidbey Island
), spread out, cruising, lob-tailing and heading north in the current line. 3-4 young males, lots of females, 1 or 2 juveniles--hanging to the Whidbey side of the Sound.

Was talking to my brother on the phone around
1PM
today when suddenly; I heard him say, WHALES! When I said how many, his reply was, LOTS! He called me back and described
Orcas
very close near shore; heading north along the
Bush Point
boathouse spread out towards lighthouse and restaurant. Huge dorsal fins and sizes of all kind. Many smaller orcas also. Whales not breaching but surface (periscoping) activity.

Orca Network received a call from Christina Baldwin at
1 pm
(see above report); a call from Bev Wenthin of
Bush Pt
. reporting a pod of whales heading north past Bush Pt. at
1:12 pm; a call from Dan Fouts at
1:18 pm, reporting a group of 4 and another group of 3 orcas heading north, just north of Bush Pt (Spyglass Ln), and two anonymous callers reporting dozens of whales, spread out heading north past Lagoon Pt. at

1:45 &
1:49 pm
. Amy Traxler of the Whale Museum passed along a sighting they had received of a huge group of whales off Bush Pt. at 1 pm. At

2:43 pm
Chrissy McLean of the
Pt. Townsend
Marine Science Center called to report they were hearing faint calls on OrcaSound's PTMSC
hydrophone
.

Hearing faint calls,

After receiving the first few calls, we took off to try to find the whales. Howard went by sea with Jill and Clarence Hein (his report below), and I went by land, finding the [
orcas
] at Lagoon Pt. just as I drove up at

1:40 pm
- a breach signalling me I was in the right place at the right time! They were spread out from the Whidbey side to mid-channel, MANY whales, some smaller tight groups, a little splashing and breaching but mostly just fast travel north through choppy waters. By

2:25 pm
they were off
Admiral's Cove
, still heading north. At ~3 they were off Ft. Casey, very spread out. By

3:15
they were half way to Pt. Partridge, some of the pods were lined up abreast, but still spread out, as they continued north.

After getting calls reporting
orcas
at
Bush Point
, we launched at Keystone at

1:50
and headed south into heavy seas. After moving south about a mile, at

2:20
we saw two male dorsal fins just southeast of us, throwing up huge rooster tails in the whitecaps. Then another dozen or so appeared in the next ten minutes, all heading in a line between Lagoon Point and Keystone. They were mostly just traveling north, with some foraging and a few breaches. We got photos of
J1, J34, L73 and J27
. The riptide north of Keystone in 20 knot winds prevented us from going any further so we ended the encounter at about
3:00 PM. Due to weather/sea conditions and the whales being very spread out we can only guestimate the number of whales as somewhere between 25 and 50, with J and L pod members confirmed.
