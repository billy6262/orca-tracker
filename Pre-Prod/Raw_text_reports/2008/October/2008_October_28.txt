Orca Sightings for October 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
While out on the
10am
POW Zodiac, skippered by Mark, we observed three
Humpbacks
south of Race Rocks off Constance Bank through the binoculars. The three 'Humpies' were amazing, doing what they do best 'Fluking' just before a long dive. We encountered
K pod
. Suddenly we were surrounded by Orca. It became apparent that there were several members of K pod foraging and some heading toward
Race Rocks
. They did however change directions on several occasions and finally headed south east. Guess who else was with the K's. Onyx, L 87. 15 year old, Lobo, K 26 made two close passes.

2
orcas
(including 1 adult male), sighted at 46° 11 49 N/124°13 10 (off mouth of
Columbia River
) at ~
0900
. Adult male had distinct bent tip of dorsal fin (visible in photo). I did not have a camera upon initial sighting. Photo was taken at greater distance but dorsal is still clear as well as a portion of the saddle patch.
