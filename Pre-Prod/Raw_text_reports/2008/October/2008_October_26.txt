Orca Sightings for October 26, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
3
greys
were seen in Crescent Bay west of
Port Angeles
. Also, friends who were paddling from Neah Bay to Port Angeles spotted several greys and humpbacks near Sail Rock just east of the Makah Reservation.

The
12.15 pm
Ocean Magic out of Victoria, found
K pod
off San Juan. Many members were present but still we noticed an absence of K 21 and his sister K 40. The whales that were present were busy heading north for a while and then south.

Calls started at
20:25 (

12:25
over there - Pacific time) at
lime kiln hydrophone
, about 45 minutes later at OrcaSound . Now, at
21:25, not hearing them anymore. My guess is K-pod, since they are around the most these days.

We thought we'd missed out on the calls, but when we tuned into
OrcaSound
at
2 pm
we heard many loud calls and a little boat noise. We looked at OrcaCam at

2:25 pm
and saw whales and boats in front of the
Center for Whale Research
, looked like they were heading south. At
2:35 pm they were off Bellevue Pt. but we never heard any further calls off Lime Kiln or OrcaSound.

We were so thrilled to hear that
K-Pod
was on the west side of
San Juan
yet again (making this 6 days out of the last 7). They were spotted by Captain Ivan near Eagle Point in the morning, and like they've done the previous 3 days, they headed up island towards Kellett Bluff, only to turn back around and speed swim back down towards Lime Kiln. A beautiful spyhop by new matriarch K11 as we first came on scene had all aboard "oohing" and "aahhing". It is such a treat to see the whales still hanging around---must be a late run of chum salmon passing through?

We picked up
K-pod
just South of the
Beaumont Shoal
cardinal marker (mid-Haro) at approx.
1630
hrs. The whales were spread into their respective family groups with K-11 leading the way, while K-14 and little K-42 were well South of the main group, with big brother Lobo (K-26) following close behind. No playing or vocals today. They were on a mission as they headed West at speeds between 8-11 kts. I was the last boat to be with them and we departed the scene at 1730 hrs. 2.5nm South of Trial Island. They continued to the Southwest at a very high rate of speed although they had 3.3 kts. of current in their favour.
