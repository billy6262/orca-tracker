Orca Sightings for October 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:49 am - J Pod
is passing by the center right now (west San Juan Island), and you can hear them on OrcaSound. It's foggy off the island, so we can't make any visual IDs.

- Just starting to hear
SR
calls over ship noise at Orcasound hydrophone. No calls/noise earlier at Lime Kiln, so they're likely southbound (along with the vessel(s)).
Scott Veirs, Beam Reach, Seattle
