Orca Sightings for December 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Island Packers out of Ventura CA saw
6 Transient Orcas
off the coast of
Oxnard CA
. They seem to be traveling eastward at a good speed. There was 1 male for sure. We saw the whales on the
9:30a.m. trip. When we left the Orcas it was about 12p.m. and at that time, they were not too far from Malibu definitely heading in that direction.
