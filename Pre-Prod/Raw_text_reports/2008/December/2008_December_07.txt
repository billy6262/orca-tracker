Orca Sightings for December 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center was with
J's, K's and a few L's
between Vashon Island and Pt. Defiance until about

4:15 PM
, as the whales returned northward toward Gold Beach.
*
Appeared to be perhaps a dozen to 20 in
pod
. Sighted in
Dalco Passage
about 1/2 mile north of the Pt. Defiance Ferry landing. Traveling east to west toward north entrance to the Narrows. They were stretched out for some distance (maybe a quarter mile). Appeared to be all sizes.

I saw a "pod" of
Orcas
in Commencement Bay swimming North/Northwest towards
Vashon Island
. I live above the Bay and Ruston Way in Tacoma. I saw them about noon. I was in shock as I have never seen so many in the Bay before. There were females and young ones and I believe adult males also.

Jon Paterson called with a report of two pods of
orcas
about 300 yards offshore from
Commencement Bay
.
*
8
Orcas
headed south toward
Tacoma Narrows Bridge
then turned around and swam back north, from
2-4pm
(we were at Owen Beach at Point Definance Park and they were swimming between Ruston Point and Vashon Island). One very large male, 3 females and one baby (unsure about the other three counld be small males or large females).

1:34 PM
- The captain of the Ferry Rhododendron reported
20-30 orcas
milling off
Pt. Defiance
.
*

1:30 PM - 4 PM
- We observed a pod of
Orcas
swimming toward
Pt. Dalco
from the vicinity of Dash Point between
1:30 &
2:00 PM. The Orcas were swimming in groups of 2-4 and the groups were spread out over a distance of approximately 2 nautical miles. There were at least 5 different groups, perhaps a couple more. We estimated a total of 20-25 individuals. At
3:00 PM we observed a tight cluster of Orcas off Pt. Dalco from the Dalco overlook on 5-Mile Drive at
Pt. Defiance
. They swam toward Pt. Defiance and came close enough to be heard when they blew. These individuals remained tightly clustered and remained submerged for longer periods than the small groups observed earlier. This cluster was being tracked by a vessel with personnel dressed in orange. The cluster turned toward Owen Beach and by the time we got there, the Orcas were in the vicinity of the Tahlequah Ferry terminal, heading toward Quartermaster Harbor. This was at about

4:00 PM
. We did observe at least two individuals with very tall fins.

11:30 AM
- Joy Nelson called to report at least 20
orcas
were seen at
Pt. Robinson
at

10:45
and at
Gold Beach
about

11:20
, headed toward Commencement Bay.
*

9:36 AM
- The first group was small - about 5. Just 5 minutes ago a huge amount more went by much closer and spread out across the entire channel. At one point we saw 10 of them on the surface. Several of them breached and were playing around. Still moving through very fast, but a very nice treat on a Sunday morning! So many of them all in one place. The water is completely flat and calm, so it made it very easy to spot them.

9:30 AM
- An aluminum boat appeared around
9:30 right off of Des Moines watching things - looked somewhat official. I hope they decide to come back along this side of the island so we can see them again! And in the space of 10 minutes, they're
*
past
*
Des Moines and heading further south. In a real hurry. Saw two in the lead, one that looked smaller.

9:03 AM
About 2 miles northward of Des Moines on that side of the channel. Jumping out and such. We're on the Vashon/Maury side near Luana Beach and have a great view through the binoculars.

Mendocino CA
