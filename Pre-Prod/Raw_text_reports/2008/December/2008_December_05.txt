Orca Sightings for December 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just got in (about
2 PM
) from watching about
5 or 6 orca
for about 45 minutes feeding in front of our house and slowly making their way south. We are on the east side of
Orcas on Rosario Strait
looking out at the Pea Pod Rocks. One female breached twice. Lots of sea birds overhead and orca actively fishing together. There was one male and several females and a calf.
