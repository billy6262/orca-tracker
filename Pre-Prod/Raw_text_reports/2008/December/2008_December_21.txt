south of Edmonds

A pod of
Orca
in middle of
Admiralty Inlet
, I would guess maybe 10 sighted at

10:00 AM
headed south. Several large males. We first noticed the Clipper going very slow. I was watching one though my binoculars and had never noticed how they at times swim nearly on the surface slapping its tail above the surface. I was thinking when watching the Orca they don't seem to care how rough the water is or what the temp is.
