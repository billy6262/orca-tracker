Orca Sightings for December 24, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was told there were at least
10 orcas
headed south in the
Haro Strait
today approx

12:30
- close to shore near
Hannah Heights
. I missed them completely...but there was at least one large male and a baby present in the group. This is a reliable source....Merry Christmas!!!
