Orca Sightings for November 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

3:15 PM
my husband Peter heard and then saw a
whale
blow just south of Spring Beach. It was big, maybe 20-25' long and it surfaced three times before Peter lost sight of it. 'Twasn't an orca but Peter's not sure otherwise. It was heading south in Colvos Passage and was about a third of a mile from Vashon Island.

, just north of
Crescent City, Calif.
in 20 fathoms of water.

Are you listening to OrcaSound's
Lime Kiln hydrophone
? Faint calls at

18:21
. Calls getting louder at
18:25; sounds like Ks - but hearing more than just K pod calls.
6:36pm the whales are definitely getting louder !!! .

Just now (

12:10 pm
) heard a few brief calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
, too brief to tell who it is or where they are headed.

We tuned into OrcaSound's
Lime Kiln hydrophone
at

12:30
and listened to calls intermittently until about

1:30 pm
. Nothing on OrcaSound's OS hydrophone or on the Center for Whale Research OrcaCam. Heard a few more faint intermittent calls at
2:09 pm, then nothing for awhile. We just tuned in again at
4:40 pm to hear more calls - this time enough to recognize they are So. Residents, but not sure which pods. We're hearing more calls than we heard earlier in the day, and as of

5:05 pm
are still hearing calls, with ship noise.
