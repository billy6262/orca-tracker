Orca Sightings for November 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
12 noon
Zodiac went east from Victoria and found several
Dall's Porpoise
and a
Minke Whale
at
Beaufort Shoals, Haro Strait
.
Marie, Orca-Magic POW.
*
Approximately

1:30pm
, single large male
orca
seen travelling north approximately 3/4 mile east of lighthouse point on
Mayne Island
. Guessed it could've been T14 due to his large size, sneaky dive pattern and loner behaviour.
