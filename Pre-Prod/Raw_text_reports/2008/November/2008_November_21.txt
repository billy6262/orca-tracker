Orca Sightings for November 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:19 am:
I am hearing faint calls on the
OrcaSound hydrophone
on San Juan Island. I have been hearing them since about
9:58 your time. A ship is going by now so I am not hearing them. Update: I heard the orca on the Orcasound hydro from

9:58 am
12:18 pm
your time. They were making a lot of clicking and the calls were quite loud at times. I did see two orca on the orcacam but it was too far to id them. I am now hearing them on the Lime Kiln Hydro and it is

2:34
your time.

After getting a call from Cathy Bacon (see above report), we tuned into OrcaSound and listened to some great
calls
from

10:35 am until noon
or so; then by

12:15 pm
we were hearing calls at Lime Kiln, so the whales were heading south.

Hearing some faint calls on Orcasound now,

12:05pm
Pacific time. Hearing faint calls, whistles and clicks on the Lime Kiln hydrophone at

12:16pm
, sounds like K's or L's??

Dave Elllifrit of the Center for Whale Research called at

11:30 am
to confirm the ID's of the orcas heading south down San Juan Island. He observed
J and K pod
, as well as L87. The whales were spread out across the strait, heading south at a good pace. Individual ID's he was able to obtain are:
J2, 17, 27, 28, 33, 35, 31, 39; K12, 13, 20, 21, 25, 26, 34, 40; and L87
.

Got a call from my good pal Jeff Hogan (approximately

10:15 AM
) saying he was hearing vocals on
Val Vier's hydrophone
. I heard a couple of faint
K Pod calls
, but no whales. Finally, after about 15 minutes of scanning, one of the whales was kind enough to breach! Then the calls began in earnest, and this time though they were J-Pod calls. So a scan closer to shore had a bunch of whales moving south along San Juan Island just south of Open Bay and north of The Center For Whale Research. Soon a few whales became
K Pod, J Pod, and L87
. I watched the whales surfacing amongst the 4-5 foot chop offshore, and the whales closer in were having much smoother water. Lots of lunges, direction changes, and circling seem to indicate fishing behavior.
