Orca Sightings for November 2, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Friends went fishing off shore of Punta Chivato in the mouth of the Bay of Conception (Sea of Cortez - Baja, Mexico). These are the gps #'s [N 27 03 13.03 W 111 55 15.23]. They reported an encounter that scared them. While trolling with a Mackerel, something hit the bait with enough power to strip the entire line from the reel. Seconds later a pod of 6 Orcas and 2 calves came to surface. Two of the larger Orcas came right to the boat and head butted and pushed the 25 foot boat in what I would call a defensive way to keep the boat away from the baby Orcas. The Mexican guide, in a panic, motored quickly away from the Pod, then stopped to watch as the Orcas moved away to the south.One of them looked much older than the others, with lots of wrinkles. It all happened so quick that no one had time to try to remember any markings of the Orcas. No one had a camera to photo the event. I have fished that area for many years and have never seen Orcas in that area before but have seen many Grays with calves, lots of dolphins, lots of fish - bait fish and tuna.

Prince of whales had found 3
Humpback
Whales 2.7 nm Southwest of
Constance Bank
. We made our way out to Radar's location, and at 1450 hrs. we spotted two of the three animals. We stayed in the vicinity just Southwest of
Constance Bank
for approximately 1 hour with the two Humpbacks. These animals were identified as BCY 0324 & BCX 1057. Both spent the entire time feeding doing extremely long dives of 8-10 minutes. This made for tricky viewing considering the sea state we had out there today. Near 1600 hrs. a third smaller unidentified Humpback was seen in the same area, however no tail fluke was seen on this animal. I would estimate the animal to be under 3-4 years old.Very small. We left scene at 1615 hrs. and headed West to Race Rocks and beyond.
