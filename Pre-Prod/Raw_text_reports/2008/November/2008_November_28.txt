At

9:30
this morning, I received a call from Jim on the Victoria Clipper IV informing me of "many
Orcas
" a few miles
South of Hein Bank
traveling slowly to the West. Radar phoned me to say that he had found a few whales 0.5 nm to the East of the VG Buoy (3.5 nm East of Race Rocks) Upon arrival to VG, we found
J27
(Blackberry) with his siblings. The whales were very spread out (foraging) at this point as they traveled slowly to the West. A few miles to the South, we found other Westbound Orcas, including
K21
(Cappucino),
K40
(Raggedy),
K11
(Georgia) and
L87
(Onyx) almost as far South as the PA buoy. At Race Rocks we found
L57
(Faith) along with
L7
(Canuck) and
L53
(Lulu) just to the South of Race. They swam quickly to the West, like all other animals thus far. After leaving Race Rocks we started back towards Victoria and not 3 minutes out we bumped into almost all of J-pod exactly 1nm offshore of William Head. These animals, however, were not Westbound instead they were headed North right towards downtown Victoria. We left a very grouped-up J-pod at
4:30 a few miles offshore of Parry Bay headed North, while the K's and L's were left South of Race Rocks still headed West at
3:55.

Today we spotted
a big male
traveling with another whale SE out of
Moss Landing CA
. About an hour later further in towards shore, we found 5 more members of the pod whom we followed until they caught up with the big male. The male and his traveling buddy had made a kill and two whales popped up with a torn- up sea lion in their mouths. One whale swam directly under our boat and I was lucky enough to snap a photo. Soon after, the pod split up. Steve Johnson will send in some pictures too so hopefully we can identify some of these whales. The female with the "M" notched into her dorsal fin was traveling with a very small baby.
