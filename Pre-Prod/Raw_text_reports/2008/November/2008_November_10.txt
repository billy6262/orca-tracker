Orca Sightings for November 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had reports of
Transients
at
Race Rocks
and a single
Humpback
just Southwest of
Constance Bank
. The morning departures were unable to find the Transients but "Radar" from Prince of Whales was able to locate the Humpback. On our way back home at or very near sunset (
1645
hrs.) we found the elusive [
humpback
] which managed to elude all the afternoon boats. We left the
Humpback
very near dark at
1710
hrs.
