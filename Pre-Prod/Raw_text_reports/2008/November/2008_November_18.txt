Orca Sightings for November 18, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Marilyn aboard the Windwalker, relaying a report from her daughter who had observed ~20
orcas
, including 1 adult male, from the Victoria Clipper around

10:30 am
, near Clover Pt./
Trial Island
, heading NE.
*
1400-1700
- While pulling out of Victoria Harbour for our 1400 departure we came across scattered
orcas
between
Albert Head-William Head
that were foraging in a Southwesterly direction. They had been viewed in the general area throughout the day heading West from Race Rocks then swinging around toward Victoria at around 1400. I saw members of all three pods for sure, taking some nice photos of K-40 Raggedy, K-26 Lobo, J-28 Polaris, L-57 Faith and others. Later in the afternoon they somewhat grouped up and headed West with the ebb tide, the majority heading through Race Passage, scattered but steadily travelling West approx 1/2 mile- 3 miles offshore.
