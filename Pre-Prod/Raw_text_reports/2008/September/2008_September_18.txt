Orca Sightings for September 18, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Stefan Jacob and Barbara Todd of the Center for Whale Research responded to a report of whales at Turn Point heading South. The center vessel, Orca, encountered
J's, K's and L's
spread out in groups traveling fast at Kellett Bluff (48 36.93 N;123 13.09 W). The encounter ended at

1:47 p.m
. just off Bellevue Point (48 26.80 N;123 05.28 W). The whales continued to travel south.

With a report of
Residents
heading south from Turn Point, we cruised to the west side (San Juan Island). Once on scene we had reports from other boats that there were
Js & Ks
already south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. Fortunately out of the blue we saw a few dorsals south of Henry Island, but still north of the Lighthouse. At first the big male looked like J26, open V saddle patch - with the Orcas moving fast and spread out a little tough to confirm it. We were able to parallel a female that was offshore a bit, with an open patch, notch on the trailing side 1/3 from the top, and a nick at the base of her leading edge dorsal - L67. These little differences on the dorsal fin allow us to distinguish one animal from the next. As for that male, it leads me to believe perhaps it was her brother L78, Gaia. Further south and offshore, we had great observations of L26 a 52 year old female doing some foraging with 15 year old daughter L90 and 13 year old grandson L92. It was really wonderful to watch these three work together, changing direction, arching on their deeper dives as they hunted for salmon. The Orcas today were so spread out, we really had to make our way offshore before returning through Cattle Pass.

1040
:
Calls
over ship noise at Orcasound hydrophone. Probably southbound as there were no calls this a.m. at Lime Kiln.
1055
: Hearing reverberating calls at Lime Kiln and Orcasound and widely spaced, unusually persistent (last 10 minutes so far) echolocation clicks at Orcasound. Ship noise is fading and I'm almost convinced I can hear the same calls on both hydrophones.

We tuned into OrcaSound at about

11:25 am
, heard
calls
for nearly an hour, including some very interesting calls at around
12:15. At

12:35
we tuned into the Lime Kiln Hydrophone and listened to calls continue as the whales headed south.
