Orca Sightings for September 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
A small group of
orcas
came into Active Pass today around
4 pm
. There were 4 or 5, swimming languidly in the calm waters. The largest whale had a tall dorsal fin that curled to one side.

We had a visit from
T20 and T21
today south of Race Rocks in the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. They didn't seem to be hungry as a seal was swimming not too far off. The last time I saw these two Transient Orca was the 7th of August this year. These pics (see above) are cropped even though they did swim by just off the stern of the Prince of Whales, Ocean Magic.

We began the trip with no confirmed sightings and went north in search of rumored
Ts
. However, we abandoned this search in order to make it to Hein Bank for the Ts who were reported to be hanging out there and moving in our direction. Once on scene, we were quick to realize we had
T20 and T21
(T20's dorsal fin is difficult to mistake). T21 was a perfect example of a transient fin and gave our guest a clear demonstration of that triangular fin, which was in contrast to our ID photos of the residents' curved and rounded fins. The animals were swimming apart (about four hundred yards), which is not far for orcas who can communicate to one another over much farther distances. They were diving for about 6-7 minutes between 4-6 respirations. There were Dall's Porpoises in the area and the Ts didn't seem to be in a hungry mood given their lack of interest. On our way back to Friday Harbor, after circumnavigating San Juan Island, we saw a group of 14 Steller Sea Lions hauled out of the rocks with at least three in the water! They were all sunning themselves majestically on the rocks. It was nice to see such a big group of males together and it seems they are coming back from their summer hiatus to the Aleutian Islands.
