Orca Sightings for September 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Exciting news this morning from Annie who said she heard faint
killer whale calls
on the Neah Bay hydrophone at about
11pm
. That's a first for Orcasound's Neah Bay hydrophone!

While on the
3.30pm
Ocean Magic trip, we encountered
T31
all by himself a mile south of Race Rocks. He surprised us by popping up close to the boat which is rather unlike Transient behaviour. He was seen by me and others with Pender
T14
on Saturday afternoon at 3pm while on the Ocean Magic. What a gorgeous male he is with his very tall, sharp pointed, dorsal fin.

afternoon

At around
10 oclock
, 7 miles WSW of
Moss Landing CA
we encountered three T's; what looks like two females and a male. They would come to the surface only briefly before dissapearing for around 7-10 minutes and then reappearing quite a distance away. At one point we were surrounded by 4 or 5 sea lions and at first the orcas paid no attention until we noticed one sea lion trying to find refuge at the back of our boat. Ultimately one sea lion was attacked at the surface in one fluid motion. We weren't sure if the sea lion was killed since there was no blood, although sea gulls were interested. After that one attack, they submerged and we didnt see them for over 10 minutes. We headed out further south for about 5 miles to see if we could find some humpbacks and ran into the same three killer whales! They were hustling. We stayed with them for some time and noticed they had crossed paths with the male transient with a broken dorsal fin (
I believe this is CA217? - sb
).

Today on the Western Prince we headed way up north where we met up with
T14 (Pender)
in Active Pass. As we entered the pass, we caught sight of his lone tall dorsal fin heading east through the passage. We followed Pender out the east side of Active Pass and watched as he started heading north up the Strait of Georgia. At one point we saw some splashing and a few lunges, and we thought maybe he was pursuing something - but then he started lazily surfacing with kelp draped off his dorsal fin! Was he hunting, or just playing in the kelp like we so often see the residents do? It's a neat experience to see a transient lone bull, and the fact that it was Pender with his distinct scars from being tagged in 1976, it gave us a great chance to talk to our passengers not only about the difference between residents and transients, but about the amazing history of these whales and all they have lived through in the last 100 years.
