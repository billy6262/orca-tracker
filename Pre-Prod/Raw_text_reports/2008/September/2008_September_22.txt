Orca Sightings for September 22, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening at

6:30 PM
three
transients
including male
T19B
were heading north from Andrew's Bay up San Juan Island. It was windy and choppy out there, but there was no mistaking their blows as they came around the point from the south! It was an unexpected sighting, but very cool to see them lunging out there among the waves. I had heard earlier that this morning there were transients heading east from Race Rocks - possibly the same group?

Off into Canadian waters near Moresby Island we met up with a group of 4
Transient
Orcas. According to Soundwatch it is believed these were with a larger group of Ts seen around Nanaimo yesterday! That means they really have travelled quite a distance - maybe 60 miles or so! They were somewhat elusive - changing direction frequently but still milling about in the general area. It was not unusual for this pod to take a few shallow dives, surfacing over the coarse of a few minutes, then be down for 5-10 minutes and have done a 180 degree turn and surface over 1/4 mile away! We think it may have been the T124As - mom with her 3 calves.

11:00am
- Since we were the only boat on scene at the time, I wanted to report a juvenile
minke
whale just north of Friday Harbor/San Juan Is. heading north up San Juan Channel.
