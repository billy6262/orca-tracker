Orca Sightings for September 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We encountered the
"T-19's"
in Rosario Strait, fairly strong mid flood tide, at about
2pm
. T-19, T- 19B (B for big boy!), T-19C, and T-18, stayed close to each other, taking long 5 minute+ dives, unpredictable surfacings and directional changes, 1/4 mile distances from where they dove. Seemed to be heading west, doubled back, then west in a somewhat transect pattern. They kept all the boats and a research vessel turning every which way they did!, not sure if the researchers had already attached the satellite tracking tag on T-19B. As the Orcas headed through Peavine Pass, Ferries were on both ends, all vessels and whales navigated safely through. On to Harney Channel, with the chrome lighting of the overcast skies, we saw the beauty and power of the killer whales exhalations, vapors hanging 15' above them against the evergreen backdrop of the shoreline, some breaths in unison. At
3:30pm, time for us to backtrack and head home.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Mackenzie Consoer of the Center for Whale Research encountered
K21
traveling slowly west at

10:20 a.m.
off False Bay (48 28.851 N; 123 06.839 W). J's, K's and L's wre spread out from Hannah Heights to Eagle Point. A few minutes later
L22, L79, L90, and the L55's
were spotted traveling northwest. At

11:13 a.m
. mixed groups of K's and L's along with the J19's and J22's turned around and began traveling southwest. There were very few boats on scene and the water was flat calm. Center staff observed a lot of socializing, milling and vocalizing. The Center coordinated with a helicopter to continue taking aerial photographs for the purpose of assessing body condition, health and nutritional status of southern residents. Starlet followed the whales to a few miles west of Hein Bank (48 20.951 N; 123 07.071 W) here they were spread out in tight groups across the Strait. The encounter ended at
1:15 p.m. On the return trip to Snug Harbor, a
minke
whale was encountered off South Beach, approx.

1:30 pm
.
