Orca Sightings for September 4, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Time:
1820 to 1915
, Admiralty Inlet. the
Orca
were moving randomly. From about a mile away I observed the male kill what looked like a harbor seal. I have been seeing this pod just about every other day for the past week.

From Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research: Looks like the T30's. They have been around a lot lately.

Attached are photos I took of a female
transient

4:30 pm
off the coast of Protection Island heading toward Port Townsend.

The shot that was sent to you of the female transient near Protection Island on Sept 4 @ 1630hrs would be T30B as I left them approaching that area at approximately
1500
hrs.

There was a male, female, and 2 juvenile
orcas
. We believe it is the same pod we saw in July heading to the west. In July we saw them in 300 feet of water just between Sekiu point and Kydaka Point. They were just traveling and did not alter their course. Today we saw this pod in 500 feet of water between Pillar and Slip points just east of Sekiu. They were traveling very slow and at times seemed to be feeding. They would dive every 5 minutes or so and not come up for a while. We did see some salmon jumping in their vicinity. The last we saw of them they were out in about 600 feet of water just on the south side of the inbound shipping lanes. Some of my pictures came out blurry as I was on telephoto and was very excited. Hope these help. (see photo below)

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research ID'd these whales as the T11's and the T137's - sb

I believe I saw some
orcas
from the beach @ Lower Elwha in Port Angeles. It was like
8p.m
so I can't say for sure since it was almost dark. We did see 2 fins coming out of the water as they swam away. It was 1 long fin, like 2ft and 1 short fin. These two were swimming together as they swam west after a few minutes of watching.

These could have been 2 of the Transient whales that have been in the Strait this week? - sb

We had another encounter with the
T30s
, four
orcas
which include the mother T30 and her offspring: T30A (a male born in 1986), T30 B (born in 1993), and T30C (born in 2005). The family was cruising around near Dungeness Spit. They were swimming in a tight group and being typical transients, silently traveling in an erratic pattern making long dives paired with multiple respirations between. On our way back in to Friday Harbor, we stopped at Whale Rocks to look at FIVE male Steller Sea Lions swimming through the kelp. These guys look like bears gliding through the water, especially when seen near the Harbour Seals.
