We heard the [
orcas
] were headed out to Hein Bank so we decide to go straight to the whales and look for other animals on the way back. When we reached the whales we could see several tight groups over a large area. We approached the group closest to us and decided to stick with them as they were very active. We had J27 "Blackberry", and L95 "Nigel" and three other whales yet to be identified. There was a lot of tactile behavior and lots of "Sea Snake" viewings from the males listed above. It was a fun group to watch, they would be very active, appeared to be a lot of mating/playing then they would travel a hundred yards and start all over again. After about 45 minutes of watching these beautiful uninhibited animals we were all thrilled to see J27 launch out of the water into a full beautiful breach. He kept going and did 4 breaches in a row. And then, a few minutes later 3 more huge breaches.

J's, K's and L's
at Hein Bank in southern Haro Strait (48 23.216 N; 123 03.177 W), at

4:30 p.m. and the conditions for both photo ID and aerial photogrammetry work quickly deteriorated. The encounter ended at
5:09 a few miles south of Hein Bank (48 18.772 N;123 01.487 W). The whales continued moving southeast into the fog bank.
