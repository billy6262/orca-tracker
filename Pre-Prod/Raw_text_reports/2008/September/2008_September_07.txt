Orca Sightings for September 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Mackenzie Consoer and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research encountered
T18, T19, T19B and T19C
at Kellett Bluff (48 36.29 N; 123 11.99 W) at

10:31 a.m
. The whales were in a tight group traveling north. They were observed milling and playing in the kelp off Stewart Island. The encounter ended just off Prevost Harbor on Stewart Island (48 41.15 N; 123 11.17 W) at

12:23 p.m
. The transients were spread out traveling northeast up Boundary Pass.

T-19B
off Saturna Island (East Point). We were on the Odyssey out of Friday Harbor. The T-18s were hunting Harbor Seals in the kelp beds. The first photo (see) is T-19B near a man on-shore. He may already have something in his mouth. The second photo shows T-19B with a Harbor Seal in its mouth. You can see the head of the Harbor Seal, its dark eye, snout and partially open mouth just ahead of T-19B's white eye patch (we spared you this one!). Regards,

This afternoon we met up with the
T19s (T19, T19B, T19C, and T18)
near East Point (Saturna Isl). When we got there, they were being "typical transients", taking a few short breaths at the surface and going down for a dive of about five minutes, then coming up again in a completely unpredictable location, but basically milling between East Point and the Patos Lighthouse. After a while, though, we saw some splashing at the surface, and then watched as male T19B pursued a harbor porpoise, lunging after it at the surface. He chased it for several minutes, then all the whales dove again for several minutes and when they resurfaced, it was in a more active, playful state with breaching, spyhopping, and tailslapping. Before we left, T19 and one of the other whales swam past our starboard side, and from up in the wheelhouse Ivan could see that the second female was carrying something (a piece of porpoise flesh?!) in her mouth. From one of my photos, you could also see her rib cage, something I've never noticed in a resident whale before, and probably not a good sign. It was another fascinating and unpredictable transient encounter. Also, we heard today that the Southern Residents were seen heading back east through the Strait of Juan de Fuca!

Today we met up with the
T18s
as they headed east in Boundary Pass near Saturna Island in Canada. There are four animals in this family group: T18, T19, and T19's two offspring T19B and T19C. T19B is a big boy for his age, thirteen, and we got some really great looks at him as he and his family made close passes to the shoreline. Most of their behavior appeared to be simply traveling because there were multiple seals in the area and they even buzzed past Boiling Reef on their way into the Strait of Georgia without any known or obvious kills. Lately we have been seeing the Transients. There are three commonly identified distinctive groups of orca cultures: Resident, Transient , and Off-shore. The main factors which set each species apart are - social behavior, physical appearance, preferred food, and vocal dialects. We most commonly see Southern Resident Orcas and Transient Orcas in the San Juan Islands, however some Offshore sightings have occured in the past but are incredibly rare.

A group of
Transients
were spotted early on in the day, so when our afternoon trip went out, we knew exactly where to go. It has been so interesting this year to have so many different groups of transients in the area, and it seems to me that each group has a different and unique dynamic. Today we had T18 and the T19s traveling together (4 total, with one very large male). We first sighted the group as they perused the seals sitting on Boiling Reef near East Point on Saturna. The whales meandered towards Patos Island. This group seemed to be a bit more active than other groups, with some surface interactions. Suddenly the whales began swimming quite fast and lunging around-- behaviors most commonly associated with hunting activity. Sure enough, the group had come across a harbor porpoise that soon became their meal. They didn't play with their prey much prior to eating it, and afterwards, the whales began to exhibit some post-kill behaviors of a spyhop, a couple of breaches, and other active surface behaviors. It is quite intense and very humbling when you see predators hunting in a group, coordinating their movements, and while we didn't revel in the death of the porpoise, it was still amazing to see the power of a top predator in action.
