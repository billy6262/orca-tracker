Orca Sightings for September 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1400
I first saw three
transient orcas
just south of Active Pass. At one point the orcas started to hunt for a Harbour porpoise. As they sped swam, circled, and dove the porpoise tried to escape. The end of the hunt was seen as one female breached with the porpoise in her mouth.

We heard there were
Transients
- As we headed south down Haro Strait, very little flood tide, numerous Dall's & Harbor porpoise were heading north-away from the Transients just north of Hein bank! The four T-30's swam close together, taking 5.5 to 7 minute dives, unpredictable surfacings and directional changes. A female split off from the group, the other 3 surfaced and appeared to meet back up with her, we did not see any other marine mammals in the area. The sun broke through the clouds, we watched from
3:30 to

4:15PM
, delighted to add a Steller Sea Lion in the water by Whale Rock to our day's sightings!

Those watching the daily satellite maps of the tagged
transients
on the Cascadia web site will have seen that the
T30s
came back into inland waters, showing up on Hein Bank in the afternoon. We saw at least three and possibly four
minke
whales, 2-3 at Partridge Bank and one north of Smith Island.
