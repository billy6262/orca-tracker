Orca Sightings for September 14, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Mackenzie Consoer and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research encountered Southern Resident
orcas
at

12:17 p.m
. a few miles off Stuart Island in northern Haro Strait (48 40.161 N; 123 14.941 W). The whales were spread out in groups milling and traveling northwest. The Center staff documented most of
J and K pod
as well as several L's. At around

1:30 p.m.
the whales began to group up and travel at a fast pace toward Swanson Channel. The encounter ended at

1:38 p.m.
at the southern entrance to Swanson Channel (48 45.477 N;123 18.480 W).

At approx.
1620 Js, Ks and most Ls
were in the middle of Georgia Strait heading North to the South and North Arms of the Fraser River. Other reports had some Ls at Monarch Head and in Haro Strait. There was still a very high activity that is normally seen mostly when leaving Active Pass. There were multiple breaching, tail slaps and head viewing. At one point four orcas were breaching together. The activities decreased but they were still active as they reached the other side and sped towards the river. There were a few stops for mating off Sturgeon Banks that may well help increase this endangered population.

I was out with Island Adventures today, on scene when the
T19s
moved up through San Juan Channel as the residents (I heard
Ks and Ls
, so I'm not sure who it actually was) were moving down. At first, it appeared the transients were going to change direction and head away from the residents. But, the residents changed direction and left the scene instead. Like Monika, we also noted there was not a mature male in the group of residents. They were tightly packed and moving at a good clip. It was pretty exciting to watch these two groups come so close to one another!

It sounds as if we missed all of the excitement in San Juan Channel today, but, as we were picnicking on the land bank property (west San Juan Island) we were surprised to see
L78 "Gaia" and L2 "Grace"
go quickly past at
2 pm.
We only saw the two of them. I looked for the other 3 members of the sub- pod but either missed them or they were in SJ Channel.

Around

3:30
this afternoon, there were no fewer than 5 separate
orca
sightings around the San Juan Islands.
J and K Pods
had come down Boundary Pass in the morning, and were heading up Swanson Channel. The L2s were near Kellett Bluffs. The T30s were near Salmon Bank. And, most interesting of all, the four
"T19s" (T18, T19, male T19B, and T19C)
were within 1/4-1/2 mile of a large group of L-Pod whales in San Juan Channel! It was exhilarating and bizarre to see the residents and transients so close together. The residents were in front, in a very tight group that was surfacing all together close to the shore. There were no adult males in the group of maybe 15-20 whales that included several juveniles. The residents seemed to taking much longer dives than normal, and would surface all together in one big group. The transients were behind the residents, also close to shore, moving at about the same pace in the same direction. After a while, the transients held back, and made the second of two kills we saw them make today. Very interesting and we could only wonder what the two groups made of each other!
