A beautiful day watching
J pod
and some of
L pod
traveling north in Haro Strait. A
minke
whale surfaced right near a sailboat where the orcas were passing! We saw it surface a number of times afterwards, fairly high out of the water, traveling quickly, northwards and more westerly of the direction the orcas were heading - they were heading in towards the San Juan Island shoreline - this was about a mile or so off the Cattle Pass area. The orcas seemed to pay no attention to the minke.

We heard
orcas
on the OrcaSound Hydrophone beginning at

12:23 pm
, and tuned into OrcaCam to see a few fins off the west side of San Juan Island in front of the Center for Whale Research, heading south. By
12:42 pm we were able to hear calls off OrcaSound's Lime Kiln Hydrophone, & listened to calls until around
1:30 pm.

Orca Network received a call from someone on Mayne Island, B.C., reporting ~ 8
orcas
at

9:10 pm
at Village Bay, Mayne Island, coming north from Pender Island and heading toward Active Pass - about an hour later than whales had passed by the night before.

About

7:30 pm
the whales came by Thieves Bay on Pender Island. I would say there were about 9 or 10
orcas
, one was very big with a wrinkled fin, possibly Ruffles. The last group came very close to shore and ellicted the proper response - Ahhhhh! They were heading up towards Mayne Island but later heard that they had turned at the Otter Bay ferry terminal and were heading south again.

We were in the Haro Strait area. I think it was mostly
J pod
. I did get my first photo of Ruffles :) There were LOTS of breaches.

My neighbors work at a Hoodsport cafe on the water and said they thought they saw a
whale
on the canal. I know the salmon are in, and probably the seals as well. Any other reports of whales on the canal?
