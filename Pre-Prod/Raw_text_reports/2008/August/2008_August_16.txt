Orca Sightings for August 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Bill of Ft. Bragg, CA reporting an encounter with
Transient
orcas. They were just south of
Albion, CA
, traveling north. He was with them for 2 miles, leaving them just north of Albion. There were 4 adults, including 1 sprouter, plus one juvenile. He observed a seal kill, and saw a 4' chunk of meat after they had skinned the seal!

Afternoon
: There was a pod of
T's
in Rosario Strait, one of my favorite places to view wildlife. We headed east with the news that the T's were making headway up the strait with the incoming tide. As we rounded the top of Sinclair Island we came upon the T101's. Captain Ivan decided to focus on watching T101 and T102 as the others split off and headed north. These two whales zig zagged back and forth then all of a sudden we saw a few small splashes about 50 yards ahead of T101. She quickly moved in with T102 joining her. There was some splashing then they surfaced several time in the same spot as a "blood slick" formed on the surface. T101 then did two beautiful slow motion spy hops. We were all very excited to see these powerful predators in action. They then seemed to speed off after something else. No apparent kill but then T102, a mature male breached twice. Next they checked out Viti Rocks seeming to pass by many nervous harbor seals. To end our encounter we watched them travel quickly along the dramatic Lummi Island Shoreline with each surfacing their wet dorsal fins glimmered in the sun and rainbow colors formed in their blows. We peeled off at Lummi Rocks as they joined two more T's and passed by more seals.On the way home we stopped to look at a Bald Eagle on Pea Pod Rocks.
