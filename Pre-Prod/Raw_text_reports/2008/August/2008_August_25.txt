Orca Sightings for August 25, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sue Skubinna of Sequim called Orca Network to relay a 2nd hand report she had heard about an
Orca
and a calf near Dungeness Spit, inside the Harbor on
August 25th.
We had several reports of a small group of orcas in Port Angeles Harbor on the 26th - possibly the same pod, & again, likely Transients? sb
