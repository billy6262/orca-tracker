Orca Sightings for August 4, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out with
minkes
and
orcas
(a minke was swimming with J-1 - lucky J-1), anyway, I heard a whale-watch captain said he saw the largest minke he had ever seen. well this whale is named 'bubbleback' (when we first identified him in 2006, the spinous processes of his vertebrae were visible - and it looked 'bubbly'). On occasion, he surfaces exposing his whole back and head simultaneously, rather than roll at the surface like any respectable minke would. this gives him the appearance of being larger than he really is - with that said, bubbleback is on the large side of minke whales in the northeast pacific ocean.

Sharon Grace called Orca Network at

5:20 pm
and reported J's & L26, L7, L55 & L57 heading north up the west side of San Juan Island after having passed the west side heading south earlier in the day.

At the south end of San Juan Island towards Eagle Cove, the last of slack ebb tide.
Orcas
heading south & east, spread out from shore, foraging- it's all about the salmon! About
2pm
we saw L-7 with another close behind. A few minutes later, J-32, followed by J-34- he's starting to sprout & has a tear in the back edge of his dorsal about half way up. J-22 with J- 38 brought up the rear. I think J-38 breached right in front of the 'pooper scooper' research vessel! We enjoyed watching J-34 circle & zig zag, milling about, when we noticed J-16 with J-42 tucked in close, making a wide southerly turn. Then big brother J-33 (wow- his dorsal is growing tall & triangular!), lunging, turning sideways, then headed out toward the family. As we left the area at about
3:30pm, it looked as though all the orcas that had been heading southeast, made a wide sweep over Salmon Bank (the buffet I hope!), and were heading back west.

Found the flotilla at the southern tip of San Juan Island in the
afternoon
. Turned off motor and enjoyed the parade of
orcas
as they sped by on both sides, a few as close as 50 feet. I don't have the skills to id them, but gathered that they were J's and 25, or so, of them in number, I guessed. I got some video and didn't shoot any stills. I simply enjoyed being in their presence with all that momentary surfacing and blowing. They turned east at eagle point and crossed salmon bank until they turned south, then southwest across the straight toward port townsend. I followed from way behind untill I was 3 miles off cattle point. I turned around for home as I could see distant blows between the diehard whale watch boats and a few private ones. The whales were quite spread out and it was comforting to witness how the boats seemed to be very respectful of their behavior.

Sighted 16-20
orcas
out in Boundary Pass off Saturna Island, travelling west and foraging around Monarch head, between

9:30 and
10:00am
. At least three mature males, but too far out to ID. All moving pretty fast with the current.
