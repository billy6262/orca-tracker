Orca Sightings for August 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Most of the
Southern Residents
were out at Hein Bank in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where we encountered them from

2:35pm to
3:20pm
. The fog had finally lifted and as we approached, from a distance we could see a long line of whales that looked like they were resting, their exhalations hanging above them. As we got closer they turned towards San Juan Island, heading northwest with a very strong flood tide. The resting whales broke up and there were countless tight groups of whales, numbering 5 or more, traveling at a leisurely pace. We gave them lots of room, so only able to clearly ID the distinctive males- J-1, L-57, J-26, J-27. As they got closer to the shoreline there were some breaches and cartwheels! They picked up their pace heading toward Lime Kiln, while the wind kicked in, and we did a little surfing ourselves back along the south end toward Friday Harbor!

Captain went out on the Kittiwake to the southern part of San Juan island, past American Camp. There was a large mix of
orca
whales. It was a super pod (when two or more pods meet with each other)! Members of all the family pods were there. Males, females, and a few young calves-enough to make a beautiful panoramic view of nature. We saw a breach, a cartwheel, and a few spy hops! They were traveling very closely together, breathing and diving between and over each other. The orcas blended together. Off the southern part of San Juan island, past American Camp, we were also were fortunate enough to run into a minke whale: a small baleen whale. It surfaced several times before we had to go on our way.
