Orca Sightings for August 13, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the east side of Lummi Island, a tight group of
orcas
decided to take the narrow channel, Hale Passage, heading west-northwest with a strong flood tide. We were thrilled to spot L-111 tucked in between L-83 and mom L-47, along with L-110, L-55 & L-103, L-86 & L-106, and L-72 & L-105. I think there were at least 3 more whales with them that we couldn't ID. We watched all those moms & calves from
3:10pm to
3:45pm. At first they were traveling fairly slow at about 3.5 knots, then when they passed the red mid channel buoy, the youngsters started tail lobing, breaching, a few headstands and cartwheels, while the moms lifted their heads, as if taking a look!!
