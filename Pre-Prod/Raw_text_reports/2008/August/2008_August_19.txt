Orca Sightings for August 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient Orcas
had been spotted near Active Pass. The T's were now passing the Bell Chain Islets. We all watched with anticipation as the transients made a very close pass by a rock loaded with Harbor Seals. Many seals were quickly scurrying to the higher ground and a few at the waters edge seemed to get washed into the water with the wave created by the whales. It looked like easy pickings. Both Ivan and JB got great photos of T102's large dorsal in the foreground a large eyed seal looking at him and Ken Balcomb in the background getting ID shots. The whales passed the haul out with no signs of attack. Then, they turned and headed back. We thought for sure we would see a kill. Instead they went on a very long dive met up with the T124's under water and surfaced heading east behind the boat. We ended up with
13 T's
traveling together. Ivan checked the ID's and reported that we had the T100's, T101's some T124's and a couple T90's.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered the
T100's, T101's and the T124's
in the Strait of Georgia a mile northeast of Saturna Island, B.C. at

4:44 p.m
. The transients were traveling close together and heading southeast toward Boundary Pass. The encounter ended at

5:00 p.m.
at East Point, with the whales continuing to travel southeast.

We were treated with a great view of
transient
orcas right between Patos and Sucia islands (north of San Juan Island). About twelve animals were gathered together hunting right along a tide rip just north of these two islands. This is an area where the water shears either towards Rosario Strait or to Boundary pass as it empties towards the Strait of Juan De Fuca into the Pacific Ocean. During our observation we noticed the sound of rain however it was not falling from the sky. The sound was actually thousands of bait fish at the surface of the water swishing around loudly.
