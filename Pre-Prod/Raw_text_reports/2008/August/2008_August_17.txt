Orca Sightings for August 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were approximately 20
Transients
travelling between Active Pass (eight miles north) to Tumbo Island. This included T100s, T101s, T102s,T124s, T20, T90 and T90B (calf). The same travel patterns in the same locations were also recorded on Monday and Tuesday (Aug. 18/19). This type of repeated transient travel patterns were also observed in 2007. The primary "lifestyle" difference is their choice of food that includes marine mammals such as seals and porpoises. While their prey is quite different than salmon the hunting strategies have similarities such as group herding and circling.

This
morning
we started our day with reports of some
transients
pretty far to the north near Vancouver, BC. They were slowly coming south, so we headed north hoping to catch a glimpse of a few fins. Once we were near the whales (Northeast of the Eastern entrance to Active Pass), we watched what turned out to be what could best be called a "Transient Super Pod" of 15-20 whales!! We saw T20 and his distinctive notch, T100, T101s, T102s, and we are unsure but thought the T124's might have been around too. The whales would break off into smaller familial groups, only to coalesce into larger groups with lots of surface contacts, rolling on top of each other, and behaviors we typically associate with Residents. Not to be outdone, the transients decided to show us that they could breach as well as residents, and did about 6 breaches!For our
afternoon
trip, under threatening skies we headed north once again and the transients had come down a few miles closer to home, making the trip up shorter than the morning trip. And I couldn't believe it, but the afternoon transients were even more active than before! Dozens of spyhops, tail slaps, tail lobs, headstands, pectoral and tail fluke slaps, and nearly 2 dozen breaches! The topper of the day was a huge breach by T20 himself! We left the whales just as they were going into search mode near a few rocks with seals on them.
