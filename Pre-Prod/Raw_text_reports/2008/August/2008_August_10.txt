Orca Sightings for August 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, and Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research encountered
members of J, K, and L pods
spread out and traveling north past Kellett Bluff (48 34.745 N; 123 11.897 W) at

5:53 p.m
. Groups were loose and spread out milling, and moving slowly north. About half of L pod was observed as well as a few K's and J's. Both Reports and sightings from land at the Center for Whale Research, suggest that all of the Southern Residents were in the area. The encounter ended at
7:19 p.m., 2 miles northwest of Henry Island, (48 36.804 N: 123 12.634 W) the whales continued traveling north.

Sighted five
orcas
in Boundary Pass off Saturna Island, heading west, including J1 swimming tight with a very small one. In stealth travelling mode, with long synchronized dives, no theatrics, moving fast. Last seen nearing Cactus Point at about

19:30
.

A great day on the west side of San Juan Island - watched members of
all three pods
head in from Discovery this afternoon- they headed north with MANY whales making a close pass at Lime Kiln. J1 was in the lead with a group of J Pod whales, followed by L's intermingled with other J's. Lots of activity- even a breach or two. K pod apparently went south initially, eventually heading back up the Island later in the evening.

For the first time, we had a COMPLETE SUPERPOD! That's right,
all of J's, all of K's, and ALL of L's
came in this morning. We viewed whales coming in about 4 miles east of Race Rocks, and it was so nice to see whales that I haven't seen yet this year---L41 Mega, L73, J1 and family (too far to ID, but a group of 8 whales surrounded the big guy), J28 Polaris, L67 Splash, and so many more that were also just a tad too far to ID. Whales were coming to the surface in groups of 10-16, and it was so amazing to see so many whales again. As the whales came in, they were doing a lot of spyhopping, breaching, tail slaps and other surface percussives.

I tuned into Orca Cam at about

4:40 pm
& saw
orcas
just south of the Center for Whale Research, west San Juan Island, heading north. At
5:05 pm there were some passes very close to shore & OrcaCam as the pod headed past the Center. It looked like there were at least 2 males present. At
5:05 pm I began hearing some great calls on OrcaSound - also some weird oinks & tweets & something that sounded a bit like sonar. Calls stopped for a bit, then started up again at

5:34 pm
.

I was out back about

8:30 am
and swear I heard
blows
. Not once or twice, but 10-15 times! I ran in and asked Mary Jo to come out on the deck and listen. They were so clear that we scooted down to the beach to look. Nothing. The last blow sounded as if it was considerable further off, so we may just have waited too long. All of the blows were about half way between East Point and Baby Island (Saratoga Psg, at Holmes Harbor entrance). The one odd thing was that they didn't sound like what I've come to know as the blows of Grays. The sound was much longer, louder and tapered off slowly.
