Orca Sightings for August 26, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
J, K, and L pods
were reported off Constance Bank at

10:00 a.m.
. Dave Ellifrit, Courtney Smith and Mackenzie Consoier of the Center for Whale Research responded to the report and encountered J's, K's and some L's milling off Hannah Heights (48 28.40 N,123 07.66 W) at

11:31 a.m.
Groups were loose and spread out apparently milling and foraging and slowly traveling south. The Center also observed a lot of social and tactile behavior.
L108, who's sex was previously unknown, was confirmed a male
, when he rolled over next to the Center vessel. The encounter ended at

4:21
a few miles off South Beach (48 24.26 N,123 55.91 W).

Reports of
Superpod
! coming in with the strong flood tide, most of the orcas passed Lime Kiln Point State Park between

11:30 to
12:30 pm
, near shore in tight groups, travel mode, although some of the whales headed southeast long the south end of San Juan Island, where we saw them spread out, foraging, until we left at

2:45pm
.

4:30 ish
200-300 yards out from the buoy west of Point Partridge at Ft. Ebey State Park (Approximate lat and long 48.2245N, 122.7816W). There were two small, then two small and one medium, [accompanied by thoughts of "seems like there should be a big one with the little ones"], and, finally it was two small, one medium, and the tallest dorsal fin I have ever seen. The two smaller ones and the medium one had been playing (or working?), but nothing really active, maybe they are learning how to breach, hop, and stuff. When the big one appeared, he did a breach or two and some playing by spashing while rolling on his side. For the next ten or so minutes there was playing, diving, circling, hopping, rolling, and a breaching or two, then they just disappeared after the Coast Guard boat passed.

At

7:30 am
we saw two
orcas
, one large the other small, heading into Port Angeles harbor. When we talked to some Aussies that had just arrived on the Coho ferry from Victoria, they said they'd seen the orcas from the incoming ferry as well.

We had
orcas
swim past South Lopez (Flint Beach) twice this afternoon. At

4:30 pm
we had approximately a dozen widely-spaced whales swimming fairly slowly from west to east. Then at
6:30 pm we had about a dozen very closely spaced whales swimming more rapidly east to west, with a few tail slaps, a spy hop and a breach thrown in.

At
noon
we began hearing some great orca calls on OrcaSound's Lime Kiln hydrophone, and at the same time saw whale watch boats on the OrcaCam - and finally a few dorsal fins between Bellevue Pt. & the Center for Whale Research, west San Juan Island. The whales appeared to be moving north. After about 30 minutes or so, the calls stopped. Then again at

3:50 pm
, we heard more calls on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone, but only for a short time, then nothing. Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to say that it was members of all 3 pods once again passing along the west side of San Juan Island, but they seemed to be traveling through and not stopping to forage much.

What wonderful calls were heard today on
OrcaSound
, about
3:15 p.m. my time. (so

12:15 P.M.
your time - Pacific). You could tell the orcas were very far away from the faintness of the calls at first, but gradually they became louder.

noon
, heading north. Clicks and distant S2 and S4 (J pod?) calls on Orcasound hydrophone. S16 calls (K pod?) on Lime Kiln hydrophone. WW boats on Hannah Heights cam. Katherine is off False Bay according to Beam Reach SPOT.

Today was mirror calm as we headed out from Friday Harbor to South Beach, on southwestern San Juan Island. We got word the Southern Residents were back within range and were moving south down San Juan Island. When we arrived on scene, we got a few decent looks at some females, but they weren't arching at all and it was difficult to see the saddle to get a positive ID. We had some great looks at L74 (Saanich) a 22 year old male as he moved down island with other members of L Pod. There were reports of L5 and L73 in our vicinity, but we paralleled L74 so as not to get stuck in a bad position. We allowed L74 to move on and stopped to get a nice look at L67 (Splash) as she logged at the surface near the Center for Whale Research boat. We watched her logging for a few minutes and then she seemed to become more active and gave us a nice look at her saddle and nicks, this was great for our group because she's an easy animal to learn what to look for in the identification process. On our way back to Cattle Pass, we saw a
Minke
Whale lunge feeding in a bird ball! We got a few good looks as the Minke as it headed towards Cattle Point and then moved on to see a group of FOUR male Steller Sea Lions playing near Whale Rocks! They were rolling around and splashing over each other, which was quite the show.

En route from Olympia, we encountered five [
orcas
] just west of Smith Island. Wondering if someone can ID this male with the notches. We think it might be a transient. (it's a great photo of Transient T14, or "Pender" - probably cruising Smith Island for all those chubby seals! sb) An hour later, we encountered the new
L111
baby on the southwest side of San Juan Island at Salmon Bank. We dropped our hydrophone and listened to the orca symphony and continued up the west side of San Juan Island encountering small groups.
