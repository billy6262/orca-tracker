Orca Sightings for August 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
6 pm,
we spotted
a pod of three
about 5 miles out of Sekui, Wa. in the middle of the shipping lanes inbetween Vancouver Island, in the Strait of JuanDeFuca. We were fishing and the 3
orcas
we saw came out of the water several times about 500 yards off of our boat. The Male had a large fin, there was another smaller one, we believe a female and a smaller infant one. The pod of Orcas were just swimming thru towards the East headed to Port Angeles. We have had resident grey whales in and off of the Sekui/Clallam Bay for several weeks.

We had
Transient orcas
in our area and decided to run up north to get to them. The Transients are the same species as our Resident orcas: Orcinus Orca, but they belong to two different cultures which eat different foods, speak a different "language," have different family structures, and even look slightly different. These differences are also common in human cultures. We humans are all the same species, but we belong to different cultures. The "Ts" are always a treat because we don't see them near as often as our famous Residents. We met up with the T18s and T30s north of Saturna Island in Canada (over 40 miles round trip)! We had some awesome looks at two males, T30A and T19B. T30A is [in his early 20's] and T19B is thirteen. (For a thirteen year old he's quite large and we look forward to seeing him all grown up and monstrous.) He's almost reminiscent of our Resident male J30, who is also huge for his age.

Point Wilson, Admiralty Inlet,
1550-1610
. Four
Orca
were moving northwest in Admiralty Inlet. Two males and two females separated by a distance of one mile and five minutes apart. The Orca's behavior was somewhat different than what I have seen from the residents in the past. This small group of Orca were moving stealthily, surfacing quietly and remaining submerged for long periods of time. One of the adult males came within 200 yards of my position near the lighthouse.

This sounds like the same pod we had several reports of in yesterday's report - likely Transients from the pod size & description of their behavior - sb

Orca Network received a call from a gentleman in Seiku, who reported seeing a whale in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, 300 yards off Ray's Grocery Store in Seiku. He saw it breach twice, & first thought it was an orca, but he called back after seeing it breach again to say it was a
humpback
! It was heading from the west to the east.
