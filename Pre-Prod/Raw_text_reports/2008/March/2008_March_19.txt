Orca Sightings for March 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have an ID for the photo sent in by Windwalker Taibi of a
gray whale
off East Pt. on Weds. from Cascadia Research: These are a little fuzzy but I am almost certain it is ID# 531 who has been seen in previous weeks as well so makes sense.
