Orca Sightings for March 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients
encountered off Pedder Bay towards Race Rocks. I spotted the
T49A's
and
T36A
with
36A1
in Pedder Bay at

1:30 p.m
. They were feeding on something fairly significant as there were a lot of gulls picking up scraps as they were frollicking around. There were a few squeaks and whistles heard at the surface. They were slowly west bound but doubled back to the east when they got into Race Passage and were last seen milling east of Race Rocks.

Ken Balcomb heard reports of 12
grays
a few miles south of Cape Perpetua OR in the
evening
.

Slow in the morning, but wow at night.
Gray's
heading north, 1-2 miles from shore off
Gualala, CA
, swimming and rolling (watching them rollover and seeing the flipper's in the air is wow). 8-9am-2; 10-11am-36; 5-6pm-4; 6-7pm- 64; 7-

7:30-6.

John Ford relayed a report from Graeme Ellis of approx. 9
Transient orcas
off Nanaimo at about
7 pm
.

I just got a call at

4:45 pm
from Captain Ivan who heard on the radio that a group of
Transient Orcas
were spotted East of Race Rocks.

4:50 PM -
5:15 PM
, I watched what looked like three
gray whales
traveling from west to east along Camano. After Camano Head they looked like they were headed toward Hat Island.

Windwalker Taibi called to report 4
Gray whales
feeding off East Pt, East Whidbey Island (near the entrance to Holmes Harbor) from

2:30 -
2:45 pm
. Then they headed mid-channel in Saratoga Passage & SE toward Langley. This group included a smaller whale, which has been reported earlier - according to Cascadia Research, this is not a calf but a whale that is just smaller than the others. The 4 Grays ID'd so far this season by Cascadia Research are: # 44, #49 (Patch), #531, & #56.
*

8:30 am
. Saw 2 adult
grays
and possibly a calf (see above about the small whale) just west of Sandy Point on Whidbey about 75 yards off shore. Headed east then out a bit towards Port Susan, but now seem to be hanging around just off Sandy Point. Can't tell for sure which way they're headed now - maybe south.

@

7:30 a.m.

I woke up at

4:00 Am
this morning and listened to maybe 2 [
gray
] whales feeding in front of our house (N. Langley). I listened to them for about 15 minutes before falling asleep again. At
6:30 there still were two whales feeding in the shallow water NW of Langley. I assume they're the same two whales but I can't be sure. I watched them in my binoculars and they were the same two that were here late yesterday afternoon, Patch and the one that might be # 531 (see photo above) . The whales headed out to deeper water and then headed to the SE. Thanks,
Veronica, Langley
