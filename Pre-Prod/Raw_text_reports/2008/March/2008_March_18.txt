Orca Sightings for March 18, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
When morning tides are high, early visits by migrating
gray whales
are as reliable as my alarm clock. At

6:30am
this morning their familiar breathing blows awoke me. About 60-100 ft off shore, a pair of grays fed on and off along the west end of First St until well past
7:30. They travelled from west to east, and for awhile lurked at the bottom of Park Ave. Sandy Point residents out to be seeing them before too long.

At

5:15 AM
, we were woken up by two
gray whales
feeding just northwest of Langley. They worked their way back and forth between here and downtown Langley. As soon as it was light enough, I was able to ID one of the whales as Patch. They stayed until

7:30 AM
and then headed off to the southeast.
