Orca Sightings for March 20, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients
observed hunting a Sea Lion off Parry Bay. The
T10's
were first picked up east bound in Race Passage at

11:30 a.m.
. The T49A's with T36A and T36A1 appeared to the south-west of Constance working on a steller at
2:00 p.m. The T10's joined them and at approximately
2:50 p.m. they killed a steller sea lion in Parry Bay (between William Head and Albert Head). At

7:00 p.m
. I watched them from shore swim past Clover Point for south Trial Island.

I saw flukes of a large
gray whale
and flukes of a second smaller whale, distinctly brownish, at

6:40 pm
, by Langley, 100 yards out on Saratoga Passage from the Village Pizzeria.

I watched the
grays
for an hour from

5:30 to
6:30 pm
off Langley, and saw them far out in the channel at about

12:30 pm
.

Confirmation from Cascadia Research, regarding the photo yesterday of Gray whale tentatively ID'd as #44 by Island Adventures: This is definitely 44 or the whale we call Dubnuk because of the scarring knuckle pattern. First seen in S Puget Sound in 1991 and the only whale we know of that came down to the S end of the Sound but then found the nice feeding area off Whidbey and now regularly returns there. This is the first confirmed sighting I know of this season for this whale.

When my husband and I were walking along Ruston Way in Tacoma yesterday we saw a
whale
. This was around

6:30 - 7 pm
. We could not see what type of whale it was or what it was doing. We noticed it because there was a large group of birds out in the water and several groups of people were staring out over the water in that direction. From time to time a dark fin would bop out of the water. It appeared to be traveling away from the port, so North - Northwest. The whale was too far out for us to see any markings.

On our
11 am
tour today we found a 4th
Gray Whale
out in Saratoga Passage just a mile north of Camano Head! Above is the ID photo. We also saw #531, #49 and #56. The new whale in the area I believe is #44.

Mariel Farrow of Camano Island called to report a
gray whale
in Saratoga Passage, between Langley & Camano Island at

1:30 pm
.

It's heading for sunset -

6:20pm
- at the west end of First St in Langley on Whidbey Island. A pair of
gray whales
, drifting quite leisurely from east to west, are feeding not more than 100 ft off shore. The whales are doing what looks like a water ballet, in perfect synchronicity, drifting and circling, feeding and blowing!

At

12:05 PM
I saw several
gray whales
traveling from east to west close to Camano opposite from Langley. At

4:50 PM
two
gray whales
were close to shore feeding northwest of Langley. They stayed until

6:40 PM
and then headed of to the southeast. I took a few pictures of them. One was Patch (#49) (see photo of his flukes above) and the other I was not able to ID from the Cascadia Research pictures.
