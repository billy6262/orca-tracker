Orca Sightings for March 12, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
This morning at the west end of First St in Langley we enjoyed visits by returning
gray whales
. The first pair awoke me at

6:35 am
. With their loud distinctive breathing sounds, it was still too dark to see them. Then again at
7:40 am and this time I could see a pair of them feeding at the bottom of our yard - pecterol and tail fins breaking the water's surface as they circled. They were very close in, perhaps about 50-60 feet off shore.

It's
9 am
and a pair of
gray whales
have been feeding back and forth between right in front of Langley to northwest of Langley since about

6:45
this morning. I thought they had headed off to the northwest but I just looked out my window and there they are close to the shore, rolling onto their sides feeding. It is

9:10 AM
and the grey whales are still feeding in front of Langley!

Grays
- 10 sets of feeding pits at Mabana, west Camano Island. They are coming at high tide at night.

From the hot tub at

9:00 pm
my bride & I heard two
grays
close to East Point (Saratoga Psg, near Holmes Harbor entrance), but by the time we raced down to the beach they had moved on.
