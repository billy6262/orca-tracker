Orca Sightings for March 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
One
orca
was observed off the west coast of
Sri Lank
a, about 3 nautical miles off Kalpitiya (Northwestern Province), traveling south around

12:30 pm
. It was ~20' long, & was swimming leisurely underwater & surfacing on & off, but no jumping. It disappeared after a few minutes. This is an extremely rare sighting. Killer whales are not known to visit Sri Lanka. Perhaps they are going after the dolphins. Plenty of dolphins in Kalpitiya these days.

We spent about a half hour with the
gray whales
off Possession Point late Saturday afternoon (

3:30-
4:00 ish
). There were three and one was Patch. They milled back and forth along Possession bar, surfacing together and then diving for 5 minutes or so. I wasn't prepared from a photography standpoint. I didn't get great photos, but here are a couple. One shows Patch and a buddy surfacing with the Edmonds ferry terminal in the background (see above). The other shows all three whales surfacing (well, three breaths are visible) with the bluff near Cultus Bay in the background.

Starting at about

8:40 AM
, three
gray whales
were feeding in front and to the northwest of Langley. One of the whales was Patch. It's now
10:40 AM and the whales spent the 2 hours repeatedly feeding, heading out to slightly deeper water and then coming backing to feed again. They are now (
10:45 AM) in front of Langley in deep water, diving deep, showing their flukes and heading to the southeast.

At about
10am
, we enjoyed an especially good
gray whale
feed at the west end of First St in Langley. Three or four whales were feeding at high tide. At low tide we can see more and more divets in the mud flats, leftover from their feeding behaviors.
