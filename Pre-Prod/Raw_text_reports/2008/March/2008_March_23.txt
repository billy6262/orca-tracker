Orca Sightings for March 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients
sighted from Gonzales lookout, Vancouver Island, B.C. In the morning I spotted
KW's
from Gonzales lookout, which turned out to be the
T20's
with the group of females and juveniles (T49A's, 36A and A1) from the previous two encounters.

At least 30+
offshore killer whales
were sighted around

4:00 pm
about six and a half miles off of
Newport Beach, CA
. I just looked at a few photos: these are at least part of the group that was sighted off of Pt. Loma by Bill Lewis on 11
March 2008. They were in multiple active subgroups spread out over about one and a half miles; several made close approaches to the boats. When last seen about
5:30 pm, they were headed up the coast toward Los Angeles. Initial IDs from photos taken by Cathy Lesnick and Cris Young include: CA502 (O150); CA101 (O87); O231; & AP62 (male).

I am in
Monterey, CA
, staying at a hotel on the beach between Seaside and Monterey. From

6:55 pm to
7:20 pm
I saw at least 6-7 blows about a mile or more offshore with my great new binocs. Two whales were swimming side by side and their blows were straight and high-- my guess is
humpbacks
. The other blows were bushy--probably
grays
. There were at least two pairs, both with one large blow and one small blow. I saw one long back without a fin, then a baby gray poked its head out.

From

10:30 -
11:15 pm
I could hear what sounded like 2
gray whales
blowing & feeding off Hidden Beach, N. of Greenbank. It was difficult to determine direction of travel, it sounded like they were just zig zagging in & out from the beach feeding (I could hear shorebirds chirping between blows).

My husband, Eric Fogelin, watched two
gray whales
feeding in the shallow water NW west of Langley from

7:40 to
9:00 AM
.

Orcas
south of Trial Island inbound. Mark Malleson picked them up about
noon
.
Later: Seems now they are transients, T20's and ??. "Mallard" left them going North at Halibut Island just before 1700. And still later: It seems we had 9-10 T's off Victoria and on up North into Haro St. T20, T21, T49's T36's and a few more.

We saw what looked like several
gray whales
in Port Susan Bay on the east side of Camano Island. We saw mainly blows - they did not come too close in. When last seen they were heading north in Port Susan Bay.

Two
grays
fed for approximately an hour and a half this morning near Sandy Point, Saratoga Passage. They were disturbed by a power boat and moved east but then returned to their original spot between Langley and Sandy Point.
