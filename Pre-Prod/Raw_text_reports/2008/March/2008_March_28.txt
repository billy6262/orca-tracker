Orca Sightings for March 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just came in from walking my dog (

9:30 pm
). We heard two
Grays
below us feeding very close to shore off East Pt, Saratoga Passage, then some sea lions who seem to have taken up residence on a wider portion of beach.

This morning, a
gray whale
fed close to the shore, NW Langley, from
