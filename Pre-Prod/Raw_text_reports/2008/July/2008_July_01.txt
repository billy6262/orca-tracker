Orca Sightings for July 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
J's
in the morning with some
K's and L87
off W.San Juan Island, and then later in the day the K's up north came back down and joined up with J's.
John Boyd, San Juan Island

We heard
calls
on the OrcaSound hydrophones several times during the day, but each time there were just a few calls, then silence, so we are unsure whether these were resident or transient orcas. Calls were heard at

11:10 am and
12:13 pm
on the Lime Kiln hydrophone, and at
5:55 pm and
6:28 pm on the OrcaSound hydrophone.
