Orca Sightings for July 24, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the
sunset
whale watch trip. We saw part of
J-Pod
traveling south from Lime Kiln area down to False Bay. J1 and J2 were along shore and then started heading west (towards Canada) but still heading southward as well. In this same area, we saw a Minke Whale several times traveling in large circles but staying in the same area as J1, J2 as they were traveling southwest.

At
10 am
this morning, a pod of
killer whales
was heading south from the Tsawwassen ferry terminal towards Point Roberts. They were very spread out and moving quite slowly.

14:30 -
15:00
, I counted 19
orcas
heading west in Boundary Pass along the South shore of the East Point Peninsula, Saturna Island. They were some distance out, but it appeared to be J-Pod heading back from the Strait of Georgia - at least 3 male dorsals could be seen including J1 - but too far for definitive ID's. Some breaching, tail slapping and a great spy hop extremely close to a whale watching boat. Last orca made Monarch Head and Java Islet at about 1500 hours.
