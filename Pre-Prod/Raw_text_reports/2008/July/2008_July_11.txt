Orca Sightings for July 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I received a call at about

9:15 pm
of a
Humpback
passing Lime Kiln Lighthouse not far off the shore. About a 1/2 hour later the humpback passed Andrews Bay, again not far off. The whale surfaced and dove several times as it traveled north. The water was flat with no breeze which allowed for the full sound of the whale's blows. What power! I learned later that there were actually 2 humpbacks!
