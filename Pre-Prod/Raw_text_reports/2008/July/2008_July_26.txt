Orca Sightings for July 26, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

6:00pm
from the Bremerton ferry there was a smallish grey (
humpback
) whale near the fish pen at the south end of Bainbridge Island. It tail slapped the entire time we could see it and that was for about 8 min.

Kristin Wilkinson of NOAA Fisheries called to relay a report of a
16 - 20' whale
sighted by many people at Fort Ward State Park at the south end of Bainbridge Island. The whale was swimming in shallow water by the dock, displaying odd behavior, making soft and loud noises and trying to breach.

Orcas
in our waters today off of San Juan Island. The water was a little lumpy off the south end, but we spotted a few Orcas spread out and changing direction. A fellow whale watching boat called us to tell us they found another group of Orcas just off American Camp on San Juan Island. We were lucky enough to have a great encounter with 3 Orcas. After a good look at the saddle patch of 2 adults and seeing a young calf, I am quite certain it was L-83 with her new calf L-110!! (L-110 will turn 1 year old in August!) Swimming with them was either L-110's aunt L-91 or grandmother L-47. Such great looks at all 3! The baby L-110 was active, frequently changing direction and tail slapping, traveling a little ways from mom L-83. As we left the scene there was another female and a male seen heading east just offshore.

At about

2:00pm
, our folks on the Whale Museum land tour spotted the whale watch boats at the south end of Lopez Island. We headed to Cattle Point Interpretive Center on the south end of San Juan Island and watched several groups of
orcas
heading west past Cattle Pass at a pretty fast pace, as they typically do in that area. The flood tide was peaking, although less than a foot difference on the following ebb tide. We headed to the overlook east of South Beach, where we had a terrific view & watched the whales with binoculars for the next hour. I thought I saw J1, so J Pod? hopefully that will be confirmed. The whales were spread out, directional changes, circling, foraging behavior.
