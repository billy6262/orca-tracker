Orca Sightings for July 18, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Reports of the MIA's of L Pod had arrived late
July 17, and that the K's & L's were far north. J Pod heading south down Rosario Strait, where we watched them make a slow right turn around the south end of Lopez Island, heading west into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. They were in family groups, travel mode, albeit at a leisurely pace. We ID'd J-16 & family, J-11 & family, and J-1 at the northern edge of the pod.

We left
L pod
, well at least a good part of it anyway, at

9:30pm
about 1-2 miles SW of Lime Kiln. They were grouped very tightly together (not resting) and slowly heading in a NE direction towards the park. We believe J's were slightly further north as we could see a big group all together, exhibiting very similar behaviours. Lots of spyhops, tail lobbing, rollovers and vocalisations.
