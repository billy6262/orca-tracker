sighted in Boundary Pass off Saturna Island heading west at
9:30am. I counted 23
Orcas
, mainly travelling, but as often happens, when they reached Cactus Point at Monarch Head, they seemed to shift into foraging mode, doubling back and cutting across the current north and south. One mature whale executed a full completely out of the water 180 degree forward flip, starting with a high tight porpoising maneuver and going all the way around, landing on its back tail forward. This was right in front of the only whale watch boat around, loaded with camera flashing watchers, so there probably are a dozen photos of this stunt out there somewhere. I saw a much younger, smaller whale flipping like that earlier this week in about the same place, repeating three times in a row, but never such a large whale, executed perfectly. It was amazing! Last of the whales reached Cactus Point at about
10:00.
