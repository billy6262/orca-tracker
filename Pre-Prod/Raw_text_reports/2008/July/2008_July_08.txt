Orca Sightings for July 8, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Capt. John Stone was sailing off Alki Pt. he came across
a Harbor porpoise- sized cetacean with a fin like a White Sided Dolphin
. It was not shaped like a Dall's porpoise, & had mottled markings/colorings not like any of the above or anything he has ever seen in all his years out on the water. It stayed with him for about 10 minutes or 1.5 miles, playing and bowriding the boat.

We were at American Camp and arrived at South Beach at

5:30
. People were already watching the long line of
orcas
that proceeded to pass in a northerly direction by the beach while spy hopping and tail lobbing. We also saw numerous breaches from what seemed to be the tiniest whale (one of the babies) to the largest whale (with a very large pectoral fin). They were pretty far off shore, so we are not certain how many or which pods we were looking at, but there certainly seemed to be a celebration under way! At
6:30 we went to Lime Kiln hoping to see them as they passed by. We could see them coming far off in the distance, when suddenly they seemed to turn around and head back toward South Beach at about
7:30 (this was confirmed by a boat from the Center that came by and let all the hopeful whale watchers know).

We found
J-Pod
on the west side of San Juan Island near the Salmon Bank Buoy. The animals appeared to be swimming lazily about in their matrilineal groups. We began the encounter watching J19 (Sachi) and her calf (Eclipse) and J11 (Blossom) with her youngest son J39 (Mako). They were staying in a small area, logging and circling about in tactile groups (seemed to be reinforcing mother/calf bonds). We enjoyed watching this group for a while and then began to move up island where we encountered the J14s (Samish and her son Riptide, J30; with her daughters Hy'shqa, J37; and Suttles, J40). An older female, J8 (Speiden) was also a part of this group. They appeared to be coming right in to our stern and since we didn't know where the other animals were, we shut down to avoid disturbing them. We thought the orcas would just pass by, as they usually do, but Samish and her family had other plans. They came right up to our bow and logged (rested at the surface) about ten feet away! Our guests were thrilled and began hooting and hollering with excitement. The orcas actually appeared to enjoy the commotion made over them and J8 poked her head out of the water multiple times to get a better look at us crazy humans. I had a hard time maintaining professional composure because the orcas shocked me just as much as our guests. J14 and her son J30 were the closest and checked us out while her daughters J37 and J40 played alongside them. They observed us for about ten minutes before diving under the boat and popping up on the other side. The excitement didn't end there, however, J14 appeared with a salmon in her mouth. She paraded along the side of our boat, fish on rostrum! I couldn't believe how amazing this rare encounter was. They actually appeared to be people watching!!!! As we left the scene, multiple animals breached in the distance.
