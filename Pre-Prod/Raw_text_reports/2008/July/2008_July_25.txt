============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw the
humpback
at Coupeville Dock while we were waiting to go sailing.

We saw whales from shore, tide was out, ocean was flat. We were in Ocean Park WA, just south of Oysterville approach. They were heading south, then they came back north. We saw seals jumping out of the water, the
orca
came surfaced, there was lots of splashing and the sea birds started circling and diving. I assume they were hunting. Not sure how many there were.

18:30 -
20:15
, about half of the
super-pod
that came together in Haro Strait earlier in the day, came past Saturna Island heading East, appearing first at Monarch Head around
18:30 and the last of them passing Boiling Reef, East Point heading into the Strait of Georgia about
20:15. Difficult to count, but there were easily 45
orcas
, and probably more. They were very active, often reversing direction, possibly feeding in Boundary Pass, breaching, tail slapping and often crowding together, surfacing together at times in groups of at least a dozen, and moving pretty fast with the flood tide. J-Pod and K-Pod females ran very close to shore out at East Point, with males tending to travel further out and less tightly packed. Some whales stayed out pretty far - some big males, probably L- Pod members turning North just past East Point and cutting across Boiling Reef between East Point and Seal Rock, unusual, but possible with the high tide - staying very near the surface, dorsals waiving as they navigated the reef.

As we came through Cattle Pass and were right off of American Camp, south end of San Juan Island, at about

2:20pm
, a small group of
orcas
were heading south. Not much of a tidal exchange, we enjoyed good visibility in the ebb slack waters, as earlier reports were of bumpy water out in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. I think the group was L55 and family, although my 1st sighting of this family this season, so perhaps others can confirm? They seemed to be foraging, some circling while still maintaining south easterly progress.
