Orca Sightings for July 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I talked to a pilot today who saw a
gray whale
feeding over by the marker between Hat (Gedney) Island and Everett at

6:00 PM
. He said it was easy to spot because of the big plumes of sand that the whale produced while feeding.

Approximately 12
orca
went through Active Pass at around

4:45
. They were heading eastward and moving quite quickly. Once past us, we could see some porpoising and heard the slaps from some breaching.

Heard
calls and clicks
on the Lime Kiln hydrophone intermittently between

16:12 and
17:07
.

Reports of some members of
all 3 pods
, with J's in the lead (again) heading north toward Active Pass, L's & K's following. Then K's turned and porpoised south across Open Bay, not slowing until they got to the south end of Henry Island, an amazing sight to see some come clear out of the water leaving a wake & rooster tail! We got a nice look at K-14 & family, K-42 was tucked in next to big brother K-26, keeping up! We figured they were going about 15 knots, showing the power and grace of the dolphins they are!
