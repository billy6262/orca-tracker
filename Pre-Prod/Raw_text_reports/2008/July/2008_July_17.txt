Offshore of Lopez Island, we found
orcas
! We watched members of J Pod and L Pod travel around us on all sides. We saw breaches in the distance, tail slaps galore, closer looks of some dorsal fins passing to both our starboard and port sides, and even got to watch L57 travel past our bow after we had shut down our engines to let him pass. We headed back eastward, and watched more orcas swimming in the distance from us. Right before we left the scene to head home, J42 (the youngest member of J Pod, who will be a year old this summer!) breach three times!

I have been listening to what sounds like
all 3 pods
on the orcasound hydrophone since

10:05pm
, going all the way til even now,at
11:35pm! They may have started even earlier, but I happened to catch them just after
10:00. I could also hear some of them faintly on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone at the same time, telling me they were somewhat spread out.
