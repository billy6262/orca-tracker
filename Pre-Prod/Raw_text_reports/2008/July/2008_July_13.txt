Orca Sightings for July 13, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were cruising aboard American Safari's "Safari Explorer" at

10:45 am
in
Glacier Bay, Alaska
when we sighted Transient
Orca
T-40, along with a pod of about 4-5 others. T-40 was very easy to recognize, with its folded dorsal and white markings below. The pod was feeding. I do have a photo and a short video.

At about
0230
at approximate latitude/longitude of 35 degrees 55 minutes N and 121 degrees 29 minutes W somewhere just south of
Monterey, CA
. It came up very close to the boat in the dark night and then once more on our stern. It appeared to be just one
Orca
, but it may have been two.

John Durban, Kayla Graham, and Mackenzie Consoer of the Center for Whale Research spotted whales from land early morning. The encounter began just south of Mitchell Bay (48째 33.873 N, 123째 10.851 W) at around

7:00 a.m.
with J's and K's traveling south. Shortly after the encounter began, the whales changed direction and began traveling north. Whales were spread out in groups aparently foraging and playing in the kelp. At
10:30 the whales changed direction again, southwest of Eagle Point. The encounter ended at
10:51 south of Mitchell Bay (48째 32.037 N,123째 09.981 W) with the whales continuing to travel slowly north.

Sunday night was spectacular with 1 hour and thirty five minutes of land based
orca
watching ending the orca blues for many. At
1845
I spotted some blows from orcas approaching Pt. Roberts. These were the Js and L7s who were reported heading north earlier in the day. At 1900 some were getting close enough for the ohhhhs and ahhhhs to start. J pod still was off the Tsawassen Coal Docks and they decided to not head north to the Fraser River but rather meet up with the ones off Pt. Bob. Most of the behaviours were travelling mode and they were spread out over several miles. However, there were moments with repeated breaches, tail fluke slaps, head views and some socializing. J1 was doing his surface swimming with only one foot of his six foot dorsal above water. He had turned back off the park to meet up with three others and then the playful socializing began. The last few orcas passed at
2035
.

About
1pm
I got a call from one of our Langley whale bell network of observers who advised they had spotted a gray between Hat Island and Whidbey heading south. I jumped in the Cessna in hopes of giving them their first look at a whale. Keeping at 1000 feet above the water, we spotted the
gray
feeding off the south end of Hat Island at about
3pm
.

At

9:50 AM
we were heading South West from Camano Head passing the North West Side of Hat Island and saw a single
gray Whale
heading south. He / She was about midway between Hat Island and the Tulalip Bay. We did not get close enough to see any identifying markings.

For the third week in a row, Southern Residents have left the area on Thursday afternoon/evening, only to return like clockwork on Sunday morning on the west side of San Juan. Well, it was really, really early in the morning but
J's, K's, and L7,L53, and L57
were traveling down the island at

6:30 AM
. Over a dozen breaches as they passed San Juan County Park, and lots of tactile surface rolling as well. On our first trip, the whales decided to head back up the island, and we were very lucky to spend some quality time observing J1 Ruffles as he fed in the currents at Kellett Bluff. It was so cool to see a whale as large as Ruffles execute a 180 degree turn as he chased salmon in the strong tides. At one time he was periscoping (just his dorsal fin showing) and was actually swimming backwards! During our afternoon trip, the whales had decided to break up a bit with K-Pod electing to hang out between False Bay and Lime Kiln in the choppier waters, while J's & the "L7's" headed north. We viewed the whales near Pender Island, and for awhile, we watched a small group of 3 whales foraging, spyhopping, and breaching along the shoreline. But we had to make way and move further off-shore when L57 Faith came by. As the group of 3 came close enough to put a telephoto lens on for IDs, it was none other than Oreo Doublestuff Cookie (J22, J34, J38). As L57 came up to them, J34 must have decided to show off with a beautiful breach. For an 11 year-old whale, he seems to be hitting his "sprouting" early and is on track to be a massively huge whale! We watched the whales head north, and as we pulled into the dock at the end of our wildlife experience, we heard that the whales were just entering the western entrance to Active Pass.

We set out from Cadboro Bay VI at about 5 am and picked up the
Orcas
a little south of Pile Pt a little after
7 am
. We traveled north with about 4-5 whales and they then turned south. We drifted off of Pile Pt. till about
8:15 as the rest of the whales went by traveling south. The whales were wide spread and we saw roll overs, breaches and a couple of spy hops.
