Orca Sightings for July 14, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Super Pod
all along south to west side of San Juan Island! J heading north, saw mostly L's- the big guys; L-41, L-57, report of K's with the L's turned heading south. Several times females just stopped at the surface, they didn't seem to be resting, males circling back, so some courting- mating going on? At the end of our trip, I think I saw J-1, he had turned & was joining the K's & L's.
