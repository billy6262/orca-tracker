Orca Sightings for July 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
When our boat was out on Tuesday afternoon we saw some odd behavior. It looks like a
Harbour Porpoise
is here with the
Orcas
. Some people thought that the Orcas were killing and eating it, but others thought that the one whale pictured here was helping it to the surface! You can see that it is blowing bubbles from its blow hole, and that is not a good sign. We were wondering if you could explain this for us?

It's difficult to know for sure what is going on by looking at photos, but usually when orcas are messing with a porpoise, it's not a happy ending for the porpoise. We have no reports from
July 15th of either Resident or Transient orcas - and are not sure exactly where this took place; but if they were Transient orcas, the porpoise was likely a potential meal, or maybe a training tool for teaching their calves how to hunt. And members of our Southern Resident orca pods have also been observed "playing" with or tormenting porpoises, especially young ones, often killing them in the process - but they have never been observed eating a porpoise - Orca Network

We spotted a group of approximately 12
orcas
off Point Roberts between

2:00 and
2:20 pm
. The whales were heading North towards Roberts Bank and moving quite quickly with a few breaches, spy hopping, and some wonderful tandem-charging moves! As we were watching from the beach, we only caught a glimpse of 3 large males traveling far off shore.
