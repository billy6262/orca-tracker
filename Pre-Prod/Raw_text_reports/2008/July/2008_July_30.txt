Entry 1:
Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Courtney Smith, Kyla Graham and Mackenzie Consoier encountered
J, K and some of L pod
milling off Eagle Point (48째 29.545 N; 123째 07.110 W) early morning,

08:13
. The whales were spread out and mostly milling, not going consistently in any direction. The encounter ended right where it started, a few miles off Eagle Point (48째 23.435 N; 123째 00.127 W), at

Noonish
, from shore at San Juan Park campground: About 15 or so Orcas heading slowly Northward, very spread out, not far beyond little wildlife preserve island in front of campground. About a 40 minute show for us happy campers. No hurry, Some milling. Some tail slaps and a full breach. The first whales came in singles. Later in groups up to 4 at a time. Some surfacing in synchronicity. Not able to ID these whales, just to MARVEL at them.

We picked up part of
L pod
between Henry and Stuart Islands and followed them into Canadian waters. We saw several females, young males and a youngster and eventually, the Big Guy, Ruffles (J1) who was far out in front. We also saw a purse seiner looking for salmon and the CWR research boat and watched some training of the "poop dog."

At

2:15 pm
, off of American Camp, San Juan Island, we watched a small group of
Orcas
making their way east-southeast, in a fairly strong mid-flood tide. First we saw L-85, then L-87, L-89, L-79, and L-22. They were foraging, lots of directional changes & zig-zagging. Really neat to see mom with her sons & the 2 orphan males, all showing their hunting techniques. We saw them circle rapidly, swim sideways as they caught a fish, lunge, and shake their head with a fish in their mouth! They made a wide sweep over Salmon Bank, heading back west-northwest, when we left about
3:30 pm.
