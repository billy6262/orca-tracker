Comments on the
orca
report in
Santa Barbara Channel, CA
by Anthony Lombardi: This sighting has not yet been confirmed as offshores through photo-ID. Anthony believes them to be
offshores
due to the large group size and temporal proximity to the previous day's sighting at Catalina Island. He said this was the largest pod of killer whales that he had ever seen (20-23+). I've asked him to send me any ID photos: these will verify if it was the same group. We have no documentation of offshore killer whales ever beating up any marine mammals; however, large transient groups of 25-30 have been documented to attack gray whale cow/calf pairs on multiple occasions. However, offshores have been known to make very close approaches to marine mammals, appearing to be especially curious in a manner similar to dolphins approaching (and often interacting with) gray or humpback whales.
Offshores confirmed & ID'd in Santa Barbara Channel, CA: After receiving photos from Anthony Lombardi, Alisa Shulman Janiger was able to confirm this sighting as offshores & ID several of the whales: Two of these are good ID shots: DEFINITELY OFFSHORE KILLER WHALES!! The ones that I recognize include the large male O155, the adult female CA502 (O150), and the female AP73 (all photographed off Pt. Loma on 11
March 2008; CA502 was confirmed in photos taken off Newport Beach on 23
March 2008). This encounter really adds to our record of a very nice series of offshore killer whale sightings off southern California.

I got to see
J pod
. I saw lots of breaching and percussive activity from afar. To add to Jim Maya's report--J16, J36 and J42 headed back in towards shore about a half hour earlier than the others. Then they stayed separate from the rest of the pod and foraged from about
6pm
to at least

7:45pm
right off the beach below Hannah Heights, staying in the same area, back and forth, around and around, back and forth. J26 and J33 must have been with the rest of J pod farther south, spread out off Pile about a mile offshore to about 1/4 mile inshore. When the rest of the pod went farther south, J16 and her young'uns stayed put. They finally started moving a little south at about
7:45pm. It was great to hear their blows and see them fishing again. The little one is quite bouncy. She sometimes came to the surface once for every 3 times J16 surfaced-- super calf!

5:50 pm:
Jim Maya called Orca Network with a wonderful report of
J pod
- they had gone down the west side of San Juan Island this morning, out to Beaumont Shoals, & then back in & were heading up the west side of San Juan Island 5 miles off False Bay at

5:50 pm
. At
6:42 pm he phoned an update - they were 1.5 miles east of False Bay, off Eagle Pt. now heading SE-ish.

11:39 am:
Blows and a big splash in front of my house, and just then got a call from Pete Henke on Glacier Spirit.
J POD
headed south toward Lime Kiln Park from Mitchell Pt, west San Juan Island.

I'm a student with Beam Reach and we were all just listening to the hydrophone at Lime Kiln and heard some calls which we identified as
S1, J-pod's signature call
. We first heard them at around
1315
. They are pretty faint so we're not sure how far away they are.

Listening to Orcasound.net and hearing far away calls. It is

12:18
. Some squeaks and echo locating. Can't tell if they are getting closer to Lime kiln or moving away. Enjoy the sounds of these majestic animals.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research off west San Juan Island called at

11:30 am
to report
J pod
heading south past the Center, spread out.

I was working (staring out the window) when we where lucky enough to spot a Minke traveling north toward Alki point about
12 pm
. We watched it surface several times slowing moving North about 1/2 mile south west of Alki point. We last he or she heading south from same location about 30 min later.

Heard two
grays
feeding this morning between

3:00 and
5:00am
, north of Kayak Point (Port Susan, between Stanwood & Everett), close to shore. It was very calm and quiet so I could clearly hear their blows and flukes swirling.
