Orca Sightings for April 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tim, a deck officer for the Ferry Spokane on the Edmonds/Kingston route, called Orca Network to report seeing a
whale
hanging around the area the past few weeks that they believe is a
Minke
. They never saw any flukes come up, & we have had several other minke sigthings in the area, but we also alerted them to the presence of the juvenile humpback in the area in case they catch a glimpse of that one too!
