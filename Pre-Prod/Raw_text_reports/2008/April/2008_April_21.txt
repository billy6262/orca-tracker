Mark Malleson called Orca Network at

2:35 pm
Monday to report
Transient
orcas (T101's) south of Discovery Island, heading north. They had been feeding on something south of Victoria.
*
The
T100s and T101s
head northwest up Haro Strait. The bull is T102. I first spotted them milling around a group of birds south west of Discovery Island (48.4 123.3) at

2:05 p.m
. They looked like they were finishing off a kill. I left them heading north-west up Haro Strait near Beaumont Shoals at

2:50 p.m.

Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research encountered and observed
transients
northbound in Haro Strait at
5 pm
at 48째 62.01 N, 123째 24.43 W. The adult male T102 was traveling with the T100's and T101's - eight whales in total. "After Mark Malleson's visit with them off Discovery Island, they travelled up Haro Strait and into the Canadian waters of Swanson Channel," said Ken Balcomb, director of the Center for Whale Research. "We observed the eight whales for nearly an hour and no hunting was observed during that time. Though we saw a dozen juvenile Dall Porpoises in Boundary Pass not far from the whales, and many harbor seals in the water off Stuart Island. It was reported by a whale-watch operator that these Transients fed earlier in the day off Discovery Island, so perhaps they were not hungry for the rest of the day." the encounter ended at

5:50 p.m.
at 48째 70.46 N, 123째 24.21 W. For photos and report go to the
Center for Whale Research website

Heard it through the grapevine (actually from Ivan) that a group of
Transients
(rumored to be the T-100's) were heading in from Trial Island/Seabird, through Haro Strait and up past Mandarte. I did not get out to see them in the boat, but you could see the blows from San Juan Island.

On the Island Explorer 3 we found
Gray whales
#22, #383, #49 and another whale that remained anonymous! We first found #22, #383 & #49 on the western side of Gedney/Hat Island. Patch, #49, was moving towards Everett and the southern portion of Gedney. We then witnessed #22 & #383 resting just slightly north of where we first saw #49. We found another whale just south of Camano Head. This unidentified whale had long down times and we left it off the eastern north side of Gedney. We saw Patch, on our way back to the dock, on the south eastern side of Gedney.
