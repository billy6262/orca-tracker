Orca Sightings for April 26, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
It looks like we saw the juvenile
Humpback
off of Possession Point from our sailboat at the north end of Rolling Bay on Bainbridge Island. Time was

10:20am
and the whale was heading south close to shore. It was fishing along the current line and had a distinctive dorsal fin and the tail fin was quite obvious before long dives.

Nice to see the photo of the
humpback
in Mutiny Bay. This time of year there are lots of food for humpbacks in the nearshore. The most likely would be "clouds" of juvenile chum and pinks outmigrating. This is juvenile pink year for many streams and the little pinks often school with chums in great numbers. Juvenile sandlance are also out now and herring ought to be joining them too --- all major humpback foods. I also got an interesting email last week from Hood Canal where it is reported that "krill" has been washing up on shores in large numbers. Krill kill - maybe that humpback found a bundle of krill drifting around?

We spent the
afternoon
, enjoying flat water, bright sunshine, and a group of
transient
orcas (7?), along with male, T-14. This fairly tight group was spotted on the west side of D'Arcy Island along the west side of Haro Strait. We arrived about

1:00 p.m.
and watched as the group zig-zagged around the channel between Vancouver Island and D'Arcy Island. They were on long dives, and then surfaced, going either north or south - or west, or east. There appeared to be several youngsters with the older females, and a calf that was maybe just over a year.

Mark on the Victoria Clipper called Orca Network at

9:20 am
to report a
humpback whale
in Admiralty Inlet, between Useless Bay and Pt. No Point. They watched it raise it's huge pectoral fin, and it did about 20 tail-lobs as it slowly moved NW.

John Herman saw the
humpback
in Admiralty Inlet, and observed it crossing from mid- channel over to Skunk Bay, where it was last seen still slowly heading NW at

11:20 am
.
