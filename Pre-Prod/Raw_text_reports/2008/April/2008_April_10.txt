Orca Sightings for April 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a great day watching
gray whales
today. We spotted Three Gray Whales between Whidbey Island and Hat Island around
noon
today. #21 and #22 were swimming closely together and #49, Patch, was nearby, but on his own. #21 and #22 made their way over to the shore of Hat Island for some feeding and they did spy-hop after spy-hop (5x) right next to the shore. By

2:00 pm
all three whales moved east and were between Hat Island, Whidbey Island and Everett. I've attached a few photos for you!

11:20 AM.
I just watched a
gray whale
close to Langley, head out to the center of the channel, do some deep dives and then head to the north. And earlier in the day: There were, what sounded like, two gray whales back again this morning at
4:20 AM, splashing and blowing as they fed along the beach. They moved along, heading southeast after about 25 minutes.

We had just boarded the ferry at Clinton,

10:30am
today, when the captain announced there were [
gray
] whales off the bow. I saw two whales, heading southwest about 400 yards offshore. A couple blows from them, swimming in tandem, then they disappeared.
