Orca Sightings for April 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit were launching the Center's new minimum impact research vessel, "T-Bo" (which is an acronym for tin boat) at Roche Harbor, when Brian Goodremont (San Juan Outfitters) told them that
J pod
was off the west side of San Juan Island. Ken and Dave responded and confirmed all members of J pod present,
except the new calf, J43
, born to J14 last autumn and is presumed dead. The 2008 research season now begins.

15-25
Orcas
were sighted off
Catalina Island, CA
33.4591°N 118.4939°W, traveling northwest starting at

6:30 am
. They were swimming & playing, one had a very large fin. We had folks with us who have lived on catalina island for 26 years and have never seen killer whales here before ever.

These are definitely our offshore whales again! The second image is of CA101 (O87). She was also seen in the previous California offshore killer whale sightings: Pt. Loma on 11
March 2008, and Newport Beach on 23
March 2008. This is the female that I mentioned in earlier reports that I had first seen in Monterey Bay, California in
November 1992. I identified at least 27 different individuals from the Pt. Loma sighting. Photographer Bill Lewis believed there to be at least 30 killer whales. Observers from the Newport Beach estimated the number of whales ranging from 30-60. Possibly some of these may have been around since the California offshore sightings in December! Thanks so much!

Greg Schorr and I conducted one of our monthly outer coast surveys from Westport. There were good numbers of
gray whales
within a few miles of shore, many apparent northbound migrants, and a few milling not far from the mouth of Grays Harbor. We approached 7 individuals, but there were others seen too far off our survey line to pursue. Aside from these sightings, it was a very quiet day offshore, with only one elephant seal sighted about 50nm NW of Westport and 2-3 Harbor Porpoise sighted as we approached the jetties at the end of the day. But at least it was sunny!

John Boyd called Orca Network at

10:55 am
to relay a report from Ivan of Western Prince & Jeanne Hyde & Sandy Buckley, who had sighted
J pod
off Hannah Heights, San Juan Island.
*
I hope you have OrcaSound turned on (

2:35 pm
) - if you do, you'll hear the lovely sounds of
J Pod
returning to the west side. Quite a sight today!

5:46 p.m. EDT,

2:46
your time (Pacific), whales on orcasound hydrophones!

I'm picking up great calls using the OrcaSound hydrophone at Val Veirs'; they started about ten minutes ago (

3:50 pm
). I'm using the Center for Whale Research's new camera too.

Beam Reach made recordings of
J pod
calls from the Lime Kiln Lighthouse hydrophone at
1305
, & further north from the OrcaSound hydrophone at
1438
,
April 1: Lime Kiln: A 1-hour 4- minute 4-second mono clip of southern residents J pod members containing calls, echolocation clicks, pebble splash sounds, and boat noise. The J16s were sighted about two hours earlier ~1km south of the hydrophone.

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called Orca Network saying they left
J pod
spread out in mid Haro Strait, between Gooch & Mandarte Islands (48.38N 123.14W) heading north at
5 pm
. Looked like everyone was there.
*
I got a call from Jeanne Hyde & Captain Ivan as well saying "guess what?
J-Pod
is here!" We saw
J16
leading the way towards the lighthouse with
J42
in tow. Out a ways was big brother
J26
. Soon I had to leave but I got delayed again as I tuned my radio to 88.1 FM---and there were tons of J-Pod calls and echolocation clicks. I should have bought a lottery ticket as the whales did come north. Again, the water was about as still as I've ever seen it, and it was a fabulous day. Then we heard the blow and saw none other than my favorite big dorsal fin---
J1
!!! He was doing three short 15 second dives followed by a long 3-4 minute dive.

This morning at

5:45
, 2
gray whales
were feeding in the shallow water. They worked their way back and forth from NW Langley to downtown Langley. At

6:15
, a third whale came from the NW and joined them. The third whale stayed till about
6:45 and then headed off to the NW. The other 2 whales were feeding until
7:30 and then headed to the southeast.

My daughter and I just saw five [
gray
] whales off Langley, two just north of the main town and three just north of Sandy Point. I'd say the time was around

6:30 am
. would have doubted that were that many, but we saw all of them (in each group) separately at roughly the same time.
Mara, Whidbey Island

Phil Litrenta called Orca Network at

8:30 am
to report 1
gray whale
just south of Polnell Pt, near Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island, in the kelp.
*
1
gray whale
at

5:30 PM
off of Bush Point, west Whidbey Island. Looked to be headed North.
Connie Hoidal, Whidbey Island

Nat Scholz called at

7:25 pm
to report what looked like a young
gray whale
in shallow water, near the Dave Mackie Park boat ramp on Maxwelton Beach, Useless Bay. It was going back & forth in the shallow water - he thought it might be in distress, but from the description it sounds like it was likely feeding off the mudflats - maybe the Bush Pt. gray turned & headed south to Maxwelton? sb

12:30 AM
listened to two [
gray
] whales feeding directly off of East Point.

12:30 PM
watched a small troop of Dall's porpoise (6 or 8) in Saratoga Passage.
