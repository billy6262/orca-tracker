Orca Sightings for April 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Ivan on Western Prince we were able to see
T14
take out a couple of seals this afternoon during snow flurries between Forrest and Domville Island. The gulls and even a bald eagle were able to take advantage of a few scraps left behind. He was originally picked up near Mandarte Island at around

1:30 p.m
. heading north west. He was last seen north of Coal Island heading west towards Satellite Channel at appoximately

2:30 p.m.

Across Haro Strait over towards Mandarte Island, an Orca Whale about 3/4 of mile in shore of us and about 1/4 mile east of Mandarte. We spent the next hour thoroughly enjoying our encounter with
T14 (Pender
) as we observed him diving and traveling and even lunging at one point. It looked as though he made several kills (probably Harbor Seals) while we were there.

A series of low, smallish [
gray whale
] spouts Saturday at
11 AM
, close to the tip of Camano head viewed from Sandy Point. There appeared to be at least two animals, and the spouts were coming at about a minute apart. We saw no fins but a small glimpse of back once.
