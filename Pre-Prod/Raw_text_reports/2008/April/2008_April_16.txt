Orca Sightings for April 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw two
grey whales
heading North. They were feeding as a pair at two different sites in Elger Bay, within 25-50 meters of the West Camano Island shore. I am guessing that they were about two miles North of Mabana for the first feeding around

6:30 PM
. Soon after, they went into Elger Bay, right in the bend where the big houses are, and fed at one site about 50-100 meters off shore from ~

6:30-7 PM . They appeared to be twining around each other or within a whale's length of each other. Their tails were flipping around at times like they were completely rotating their bodies to feed. One had an uneven white splotch on the underside of its tail, right side. Tama Fox, Camano Island, WA

Transient orcas
T20 and T21 came through Oak Bay south bound a couple of hours after the T49A's and T36A's went by going the other way. I left T20 and T21 west bound off of William Head heading for Race Rocks at
4 p.m
.

Center for Whale Research report:
Transients
- Platform: Orca - Departed Snug Harbor:
12:21 p.m. - Begin Encounter:
12:41 p.m. - Observers: Dave Ellifrit and Adam U encountered T49A, T49A1, T49A2, T49B, T49B1, T36A and T36A1 traveling eastbound across Haro Strait, heading towards the west side of San Juan Island. From a distance Dave and Adam observed a transient catch and consume what is believed to be a Dalls porpoise. Shortly thereafter, a dramatic attack on a second Dalls porpoise was photographed (see
Center for Whale Research
website). Following the attack on the Dalls porpoise(s), the transients then swam south towards Eagle Point where they caught and consumed a Harbor seal.
