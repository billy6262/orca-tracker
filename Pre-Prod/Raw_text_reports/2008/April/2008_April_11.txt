Orca Sightings for April 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We arrived at La Push around

5:00 PM
.
Gray whales
were hanging around in the cove right in front of the Oceanside Resort. We could see backs of young whales closer in and the spray of larger whales outside of the cove. I counted 2 young whales at least and 4 or 5 mature whales.

We spotted a lone
gray whale
just west of Race Passage at around
11am
this morning. It appeared to be foraging and travelling slowly in a westerly direction.

A
grey whale
was spotted near the Snakelum Point buoy between Penn Cove and Saratoga Passage at ~

6:45 PM
as we were out on our deck describing last Sunday's grey whale visit to friends. The whale seemed to loll around taking short breaths and short dives, meandering back & forth between the buoy and our wreck, where just 3 hours earlier the sand was exposed (~40' past the wreck) at low tide. I don't know the specific depth there but it's shallow. It hung around for ~30 minutes. Also, the morning after Jill Hein's 4/5/08 sighting report at the same location, Clay spotted several feeding holes on the east side of the point. We're thrilled we have more feeding activity here than in the past few years, as our beach changes with the alluvial flow up Saratoga Passage.

Orca Network received a call from Sarah Schmidt of Coupeville, reporting a
gray whale
feeding in the shallows off Snakelum Pt, near the entrance to Penn Cove at

10:55 am
, then it swam out deeper into the channel, going both west & east, so likely still feeding. She said the underside of the flukes had a lot of white, & the tip of the right fluke was missing or angled off differently - possibly # 44?

At least two
Gray's
were spotted feeding in Elger Bay, W. Camano Island around

9:00 AM
.
Dena Jordan, Camano Island

I was at Elger Bay this morning about

7:30
to help with the beach seining, when I heard the familiar "whoosh". A lone
gray
spent a leisurely 45 minutes or so feeding on his side in the shallows just outside the buoy line.

Bob Whitney called to report a
Minke
whale off Pt. Wilson, in Admiralty Inlet at
9 am
.
