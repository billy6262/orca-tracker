Orca Sightings for April 8, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
First heard whales on the OrcaSound hydrophone stream at around

9:20 a.m
. By
9:40 a.m. the first whales were visual southbound in front of the Center for Whale Research (W. San Juan Isl) -
J-pod
spread out and moving fast. Dave and I responded in Orca Starlet and caught up with them at
11:10 a.m. off Kanaka Bay (48 28.814N, 123 06.605W). Over the next two and a half ours the whales gradually grouped-up and moved in a southerly and then southwesterly direction. By the end of the encounter at
1:36 p.m. they were just west of Hein Bank (48° 22.32N 123° 07.98W) and had begun to rest in a tight group. All members of J-pod were present and photographed, with the exception of the J14's (J14, J30, J37 and J40). We did see these whales pass the house earlier in the morning. We were very successful in obtaining identification photographs and also photogrammetry data for assessing individual size and growth. Specifically, we were able to re-measure the sprouter males (J26 and J27) and also the pre-sprouter J33, all of whom have been measured in previous years. This will enable us to assess growth rates."
