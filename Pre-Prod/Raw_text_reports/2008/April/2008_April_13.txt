Entry 1:
We live in Greenbank on Camano Vista Street. This [
gray
] whale stayed for almost 90 minutes feeding, rolling and showing off.

We received a report today from Penny Blankenship of
a dark whale
, with small dorsal fin and audible blow sighted off Port Madison on Bainbridge Island. Penny observed the whale resting on the surface for a while, then watched it raise its "big nobby" pec fins into the air. Apparently, there was a whale sighted off the northern tip of Bainbridge Island on Saturday (4/12) which may have been the same animal sighted on Sunday. There has been no confirmation of species, however it sounds as if many people were present for the Sunday sighting, and maybe photos will show up.

Orca Network has received several reports of Minkes in this area (see below), but today received a report & the photo above, which John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research believes looks more like a juvenile
humpback
than a Minke. Also, the fluke showing when this whale dived is more of a humpback than Minke behavior. Let us know if anyone else out there happened to see or get photos of this whale - thanks! sb

We had the extreme luck of observing what I believe to be a Minke [
note: probably a
humpback
, see above
] whale today in Port Madison (N. of Bainbridge Island, WA). We were in our sailboat and when we saw the whale in the distance we approached it and then turned our engine off and just drifted while observing it. The whale seemed content to just rest around 150m from us. Then the whale decided to check us out and started coming towards us. Unfortunately our camera's battery died as soon as we were closer. While we were observing the whale from a distance it would show its back and fin and never pull its head out of the water. It would also occasionally show its tail just before diving only to resurface after a few minutes. It would do so in a nice controlled manner without any tail slapping or any other sign of aggression. We were observing it for perhaps close to half hour at about 150 meters from our bow. Then suddenly it took a dive and disappeared for a while. After a few minutes we heard a noise near our stern, we looked and saw that the whale had resurfaced about 60 feet away. Then it slowly but deliberately started moving towards us. We could clearly see its back and fin and the top of its head, but it never pulled its head out of the water. When it came to about 30 feet of our boat, I was forced to steer away from it as a few people on the boat became uncomfortable. The whale looked jet black while it was far, but we found out it was dark gray when it approached us. I would say it's length was about 20-25 feet judging from the length of our boat (32 feet). It never showed its head fully to us but the top of its head looked somewhat flat although I think there were some bulges around its blow hole. It was very gentle while approaching us and did not make any sudden movements

gray whales
