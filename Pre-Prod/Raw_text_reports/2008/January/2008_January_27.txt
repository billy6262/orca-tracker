============================================================

Entry 1:
We sighted and photograhed some of the
Southern Residents
today in Monterey Bay. There were about 40 whales that were first sighted feeding on unknown fish, with birds diving in area (possible mackeral). Then they began to travel and headed south into 25-30 knts wind and last seen off Cypress Pt, Carmel Bay. Pics were confirmed by Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research.
