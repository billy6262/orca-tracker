Orca Sightings for January 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I live on the hill above Titlow Beach (just south of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge) and had the fabulous luck of watching a pod of
Orcas
(6 or 8 of them) swim past my house on Friday afternoon at about

3:45 pm
- - heading away from the South Sound and toward the Narrows Bridge (north). I watched the large group until they were out of sight (the large fir trees at Titlow Park then blocked my view) but there was one straggler - - that I watched until he/she was out of sight - - was not in sync with the rest of them. Maybe this is typical, but I thought it was interesting, considering the rest of them were in perfect formation and coming up and heading back down in complete sync, and all together, then all of a sudden, when I thought they were all gone, there was one more to watch for a couple of minutes. Is there a chance you would know which pod this might have been?

This is most likely K pod, who had been in Puget Sound last week, & was photographed by KING 5 TV off Gig Harbor on Jan. 10th - sb
