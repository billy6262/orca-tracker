Orca Sightings for January 4, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here is additional info about the possible sighting of pilot whales (porpoises) or
orcas
in Elliot Bay last week. My friends and I saw them as we boarded the Seattle/PT Ferry at or about

3:45 p.m
. The three large marine animals were swimming very close to each other AND awfully close to the large vehicles at the docks when we spotted them. Actually, they were in the water between our ferry and another boat docked nearby. Their dorsal fins were black.

We did have K pod in the Seattle area most of last week, but I don't have any reports of them on Jan. 4th in Elliott Bay - did anyone else see these whales to help confirm the Species ID? sb

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called at

11:50 am
to relay a 3rd hand report of a pod of
orcas
in Rosario Strait near James Island, heading north.

I got a call from Bo Brando. He was on the ferry near Thatcher Pass/James Island watching some
Orcas
going north up Rosario Strait. He thinks they might have been J Pod.
