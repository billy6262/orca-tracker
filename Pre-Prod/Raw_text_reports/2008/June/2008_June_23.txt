Orca Sightings for June 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a single
humpback
in Elliot Bay. I was kayaking across from West Point (Discovery Park) to Alki Point, and the Bainbridge-Seattle Ferry had just passed by. A few minutes later it surfaced, and passed me about 50' away going N, surfacing 5-6 times. Got a great look at it from near by, unfortunately the attached photo from my phone is the best I got (see above - enough to confirm it's a humpback!). Sighting was at
6pm
.

This makes us think the three possible humpback/gray whale reports in Elliott Bay from
June 21st were very likely this humpback - S&H
