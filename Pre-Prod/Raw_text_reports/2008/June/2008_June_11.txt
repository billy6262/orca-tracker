Orca Sightings for June 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky enough to be out on the Ocean Institute' boat to see these beautiful creatures. They gave us a great show, back flips, tail slaps, breaches,splashing and just being very social. From what I could make out, there were 5 total, 2 males 1 female and a baby :) There could have been two females or maybe 6 total 2 males 2 females and a baby. Hard to tell because the cow calf pair would venture away from the other group and then return to them. The baby was very curious and would come and explore the boat. I hope this helps and if you do determine which
transient pod
this is I would love to be kept in the loop.

Transient ID's: Wednesday's sighting off Dana Point of 5
transient killer whales
was the
CA51
matriline. These are probably the most frequently seen transients off the Moss Landing area of Monterey Bay, often preying on California sea lions and harbor seals. I have seen them several times, often closely approaching boats. My colleague Nancy Black has seen them attack gray whale calves off Monterey on multiple occasions. They were last confirmed off southern California on 30
December 2007, near East Anacapa Island, feeding on a sea lion. IDs for these 5 whales (3 generations):
1. CA51 - adult female, first documented off Monterey Bay in 1991. CA51 has 3 offspring: CA51a, CA51b, and CA51c.
2. CA51a (born 1992). CA51a has a young calf, CA51a-1.
3. CA51b (born 1998 - a sprouting male)
4. CA51c (born 2003).
5. CA51a-1 (born 2007). This young calf of CA51a has a distinctive indentation near the dorsal fin tip, and another near the base of the fin.

J pod
reported at Point Roberts, heading north at a fast rate, out of our range. We went around Waldron Island, at about

1:30 pm
, where we saw a brown pelican! Then harbor seals hauled out on the rocks at Bear Island. Also saw harbor porpoise, again at Turn Point, along with a few Dall's porpoise, and numerous bald eagles!

Report forwarded by Doug Thompson: We got a call from Mike Bursk, skipper over at the OI yesterday that he was with
Killer Whales
. We made a MAD dash down there, put a small hole in the side of the boat leaving the dock, and raced to the spot, about four miles from the harbor (off
Dana Pt, CA
). There were five
Orca
, no idea what variety (offshore, transient or resident), but I have sent some photos to Alisa-Schulman Janiger, at the LA chapter of the ACS, she catalogs them, and maybe able to ID them. There was also one juvenile in the group, you can see his smaller head in one of the photos. Not in any hurry, just moving slowly up the coas - breaching and breaching, one, the largest, kept rolling on his back, and swimming on the surface, upside down. At one point when they came over (as they did several times), one of them actually touched our fender!

My good friend and co-worker Ashleigh Loth, was aboard the R/V Sea Explorer just off Dana Point when she called me to tell me about
orcas
that were sighted off
Dana Point, CA
. I just found an article online from the LA Times, and another link with more photos.

Just enjoyed the beauty of a
humpback
from
2030 to 2130
milling back and forth between the north point of Vashon Isl to about 1 mile south of point in Colvos Passage. Could it be the south Vashon humpy on the move? Can still hear him out there now at 2145. Still milling out front now, but lost the light, he/she just circling about mostly on the surface.

Barbara Anderson of Camano Island called at

5:55 pm

off Pebble Beach, SW Camano Island, heading north.

We were able to spend the afternoon with
J pod
today, after two days of no Southern Residents around the San Juans. We left the dock early today, as J pod had been sighted heading north on the west side of San Juan Island early in the morning. We found J pod near the north end of Point Roberts at

12:50
. We watched as the whales moved very quickly to the north, with lots of porpoising behavior. There were many whales traveling close to shore, and a few out further in the strait. They all passed by the ferry terminal and around the Coal Docks, continuing north. Ruffles was moving along mostly alone, and engaging in lots of traveling and then turn around and foraging behavior. The water was flat calm, and although a grey day, it was very beautiful out there. We noted a few calls on the hydrophone.

Stewart Macintyre, Center for Whale Research volunteer since 1994, spotted
J pod
spread out traveling north at Lime Kiln State Park at

5:48 a.m.
. At

7:53 a.m
. J26 was encountered just west of Turn Point (48째 39.158 N; 123째 13.674 W). The rest of his sub-pod, J16 (mother) , J36 (sibling) and the most recent member of J pod, J42 (sister) were traveling in a tight group a few hundred yards way. The encounter ended at
9:15 a.m. with J pod still spread out traveling toward Boundary Pass (48째 43.721 N; 123째 11.317 W).
