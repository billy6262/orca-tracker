Orca Sightings for June 3, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approx

10:30-
11:15am
, we were treated to members of what appear to be
all three pods (J, K & L)
passing northbound on the west side of San Juan Island. There was alot of tail slaps and breaching, but altogther the group was moving slowly and VERY close to shore. Definitely saw Ruffles (J-1) mixed in with the L-11's- besides that - lots of great splashes and body rubs going on!

K-Pod and L-Pod
- Pender Island,
between
4:30 pm and
4:40 pm
, 16-18 members of K-Pod and L-Pod past Thieves Bay on Pender Island, heading north. They were very tightly grouped and within 20-30 metres of shore. We positively ID'd L57, L7 and, we're quite certain, K40 (very raggedy back side to her dorsal fin). Who is the male with the very distinct "wavy" dorsal fin? And it's not J1. Their behaviours as they past directly in front of us included: several spy hops, one Orca turning over onto its back and a couple of tail slaps. Further north, at Moaut Pt, they, as usual, became much more active: lots of pec and tail slaps, a bunch of breaches and one huge cartwheel.

Kelley Balcomb-Bartok and Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research went out to meet up with the superpod that had been reported earlier by Mark Malleson. Having not been seen since
January 27, 2008 off Monterey, California, and Sekiu, Washington,
February 29, 2008,
members of Kpod and Lpod
returned to the San Juan Islands. The whales were first reported off the south end of San Juan Island at around
8 a.m
., then slowly travelled north up the coast of the island in tight social groups. Center for Whale Research staff encountered the whales off Bellevue Point at

11:24 a.m.
(48째 31.981 N, 123째 10.009 W) as they swam in three large, tight and tactile groups very close to the shoreline. Staff confirmed that members of Kpod and Lpod were among the playful social groups, though it has not been determined yet if all the whales from the Southern Resident population were present. During the encounter
a small calf
was observed swimming in close proximity to sisters K14 and K16, both reproductive age females. Later in the encounter staff determined that the calf was indeed a new calf in K-pod, and observed the calf primarily travelling very near K14 and her older offspring K26 and K36. The encounter ended at
3:58 p.m. (48째 41.81 N; 123째 14.51 W)

Around
10 am
on the marine radio I heard "This is big!" I got to Landbank just as the leaders hit Edwards Point and spent the next couple of hours watching the
J's, K's and L's
go up island. It was a perfect San Juan Island day, misty, raining, foggy and whales. It was great seeing so many open saddles back in our waters, and there are so many males with huge fins! There were groups of all kinds-- juveniles, males, mixed, mating activity groups (don't know what else to call them), kelping groups and lots of surface activity. There seemed to be a lot of forming up of groups, splitting off, re-forming into large groups, splitting, etc. Quite a party. J2 Granny and J8 Speiden were in the middle of the procession, both with appropriate kelp decor. Granny wore hers for quite awhile. I even thought I saw a new baby. I was later told that K14 had a new one with her. Let's hope that's confirmed. For awhile L41, L57 and J1 were together with a bunch of others in a tight group.

Members of J, K, L pods
entered the study area (Lime Kiln Lighthouse) at
1048
, heading north against a stiff ebb tide. During the 36 minutes they were in the study area, 15 tailslaps, 2 tailwaves, 3 breaches, one pecslap, 2 spyhops, 2 cartwheels, some logging, and a sea snake were observed. The spreadout time from the first to the last whale over our "line" was 22 minutes. Dividing that by the 47 whales we observed gives us an average of 0.5 minutes between each whale. These whales were accompanied by 2 powerboats inside our study area and 5 powerboats outside our study area. There were 2 plane flyovers. The last whale left the study area at
1124
. It rained throughout the passby.

Welcome back
Ks and Ls
! Today was our first superpod of the summer! A superpod is when all three pods join together for socialization and mating. The rain didn't stop us as we headed out to Stuart Island to see
Js, Ks, and Ls
all traveling together. We saw multiple spy hops and tail slaps as they all grouped together for the first time after a long winter. The animals appeared to be in good spirits and nice and fat. We even saw a new calf, which appears to belong to K-14, Lea. They came in to say hello today right off Turn Point as they surfed through the waves. We got nice looks at J-42 as she surfed with her mommy right past us with a male from L Pod as well as another J female.

Just in time for Orca Month, a
Superpod
took place off west San Juan Island this morning! Orca Network received a call from John Boyd at
10 am
this morning, saying there was a meeting of J, K & L pods off west San Juan Island, heading north, with the whales breaching like crazy! Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed a report that Mark Malleson of Victoria had observed the superpod earlier in the morning heading in - we are still waiting for details and confirmation on all three pods being present. Last report had them nearly to Turn Pt. in N. Haro Strait at

1:55 pm
.

After getting JB's report, we immediately tuned into OrcaSound, and from

11:05 -
11:30 am
we heard some amazing calls, whistles and superpod sounds from the Lime Kiln Hydrophone!
