We headed east to Lummi Island. From about

1:30pm to
2:30pm
,
J, some of K & L
spread out, seemed to be in travel mode utilizing the last of a strong ebb tide, then they slowed down near the southern end. Small groups near shore, a few breaches and spy hops. Able to ID the distinctive dorsal fins of J-I Ruffles majestically slicing through the water, and J-57 Faith. We were quite a distance from all the whales, as were the few boats in the area, so couldn't ID other whales.

At
8 pm
just off the point near the light house at Brown's Point, Washington, I spotted what
looked like two Minke whales
. They had the classic sickle shaped fins. They were moving quickly (traveling vs. playing) towards the Port of Tacoma. They were fairly close to the shoreline and I initially spotted them w/my naked eye, and then was able to get a closer look with binoculars.
