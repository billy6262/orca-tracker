Orca Sightings for June 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Woodrow James, reporting 4-6+
orcas, 2-4 PM
, about 1.5-2 miles from shore, heading south. There was one adult male. They were in 12- 15 fathoms, five miles north of
Crescent City, CA
. He saw the OrcaNet poster in a men's room.
*
Mark Malleson found
K's and L's
traveling west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca off Port Renfrew. The new calf K42 was seen, alive and well!
*
A single
gray
, having a snack, shortly after
midnight
. For next 2 hours heard close to 50 or more spouts, swooshing around activity right in front of our place in Mariner's Cove, on Skagit Bay. Actually, more of a feast. Even a whiff of spout sulfur smell. Looking out the window at extreme low tide, seeing a bunch of craters left in the sand. Evidence of last night's visit.
