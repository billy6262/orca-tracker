I got a hot tip from Megan at San Juan Safaris that there was a
humpback
in San Juan Channel. We got on scene around 1625 and stayed with it for about 20 minutes as it headed north midstraight in between Jones and Rocky Bay. It was a small animal all by its lonesome in this big mean world.

We were surprised with a young
humpback
whale just north of Yellow Island in San Juan Channel traveling slowly west. We followed the humpback to Limestone Point and watched him/her move away. But as we were ready to leave we were rewarded with a nice fluke display. Beautiful! The description of the humpback off Pender yesterday was very similar to this one. He/she had a mostly white underside of the fluke.

The
Humpback
seen yesterday (5/31) in Swanson Channel is very likely the same one seen in San Juan Channel today near Friday Harbor heading up the channel. I have an Id shot that I will send when I get them downloaded but the underside of the fluke was almost solid white on both sides. The whale was definately a juvenile.
