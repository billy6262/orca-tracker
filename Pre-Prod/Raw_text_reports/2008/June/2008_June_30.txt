Orca Sightings for June 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The male in this
transient
pod seen off
Oregon

Entry 2:
CA44
, who is actually a sprouting male (in
October 1992 he was a large juvenile). He was seen heading nw two days earlier by Jessica Aldren off Salt Point State Park, about 240 nm south of the Oregon location. I do not believe that we have sightings of him outside of Monterey except for these two sightings.

Astrid van Ginneken, Courtney Smith, Kayla Graham, and Makenzie Consoer of the Center for Whale Research vessel, encountered
J pod, K pod, and L87
in small groups spread out at the south end of Lopez Island, 48째 25.92 N, 123째 57.38 W, at
12:33 p.m.
June 30, 2008. The whales were mostly milling and non directional. The Center observers noted a lot of percussive behavior such as pec slaps and tail lobs. There was also a lot of vocalizing on the hydrophone. At around
3:45 some groups began to travel north at a fast pace. The encounter ended a mile off Cattle Point, San Juan Island, 48째 25.97 N, 123째 59.49 W at
3:58 p.m. Photos and more at

After a 3 day absence,
orcas
at Salmon Bank, south end of San Juan. We arrived about
2 pm
, in the middle of a strong flood tide, to find they were heading east along the south end of Lopez, when they turned heading west.
J-Pod
was first, in travel mode, groups picking up speed as they crossed in front of Cattle Pass. ID'd J-8 Spieden, J-33 Keet, J-11 Blossom with the kids- J- 37 Blackberry, J-31 Tsuchi, & J-39 Mako. J-1 Ruffles seemed to bring up the rear. Then we saw K's, only positive ID was K-11 Georgia. It was interesting that the K's were further offshore than the J's, and a variety of behaviors. We saw quite a bit of distant breaching, a spy hop, some tail lobs, then a group that seemed to be in a resting mode. That group (of 3-4?) really slowed down and we saw rolling, whales on their backs, pectoral fins (or paddles- they are so rounded on the orcas!), and a brief glimpse of a "sea snake- pink floyd"! There were no obviously mature males in this group, and we were too far away for a positive ID, so was it really mating activity, courting, or practice?! (And was there a J in the group?). Headed home about
3:20 pm, sighting harbor seals and harbor porpoise in San Juan Channel along the way!

Humpbacks
off Point Roberts
June 28-30. From Saturday to Monday the Humpbacks spent a lot of time of our side of Georgia Straight. One great experience was watching one of the two repeatedly slap the massive tail flukes. More photos

Lime Kiln hydrophone
2305
- After hearing many
S2 calls
at Orcasound about about 20 minutes ago, now heard a few S2 calls and faint clicks at Lime Kiln (but only for a few minutes, then silence for at least 10 min now). Presumably southward travel?
2120
- Southern Residents - Interesting wavering calls over a very quiet background. After about 20 minutes, there was 40 minutes of silence, followed by many S2 calls and clicks, starting at ~
22:20. Recordings archived at Orcasound.net. Lime Kiln to False Bay - 1645, Hearing clicks on Lime Kiln hydrophone now; Katherine is with whales off False Bay moving N/NW. More archived calls at OrcaSound Lime Kiln.

We have orcas on OrcaSound - at

9:20 pm
. so what are the calls that sound like children laughing? And now there is this funny "whine" sound - like when a child is mad or wants their way? A very shortened call like the "G clan" calls that sound like donkeys -not a total Eeey Aaaahhhh, but shorter. These guys are really quite beautiful and melodic in a way.

About

12:30
this afternoon we had a slow moving group of about 8-12
orcas
passing Flint Beach on the south end of Lopez, travelling west to east. Actually, another group showed up around 20 minutes ago (

1:25 pm
) - lots of whale boats this time. They seem to be just hanging out and feeding, not travelling, so they may be here for a while. The group of orcas (and boats) slowly moved west toward Iceberg Point. I lost sight of them around 3pm as they rounded the corner of my view (probably roughly off of Iceberg Point by then).

We went south past cattle point on San Juan Island today.
Orcas
were in small groups. Some of them were identified as from the k-pod family. We saw a female K-40 "Raggedy" and a larger male K-21 "Cappuccino" swimming together often. Today was a day for fishing. They would wind and dive down in place, feeding in the afternoon.

They're back!!!! We had been tracking all 3 pods of
orcas
from last night, and fully expected to hear them passing the west side of San Juan before it got completely dark, but apparently the whales decided that the south end of San Juan and Lopez was a dandy spot to hang out during the night. As morning crept on, we heard that the whales present were
J's, K's, and part of L's
. When we came out this afternoon, we saw several whales breaching repeatedly. The majority of whales were passing along the island in small, family sized groups, and spread out about 2 miles from the first group to the last group. Most of the groups did the usual "Cattle Point Speed Swim" as they passed the lighthouse and lower entrance to San Juan Channel. We did ID J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J8 Speiden in a fairly tight group. We even had an absolutely beautiful double spy hop, by far my favorite behavior.

This morning
J and K pods
were located at Eagle Point and south, traveling south. They traveled north in the late afternoon, mostly in small groups or singles. The leaders hit Kellett Bluff around

5:30 to
6:00 pm
.

We also had several reports of a small (most likely juvenile)
minke
whale, but it was doing 10+ minute dives.
