============================================================

Entry 1:
About

1:30pm to
2:30pm
, encountered
J-Pod
by North Pender, Swanson Channel, heading northwest, strong flood tide, too far away for individual IDs.

My friend spotted 3
transients,
one of which was a new calf, from a dredge working 4 miles N of
Eureka, CA
, heading south. Mother with calf and one other adult.
Mira Lutz, Anacortes, WA

I saw three blows this evening at around

7:15.
couldn't even tell what kind or which direction it or they were going because of the wind and waves, but definitely three sprays just north of Hat Island and south of Sandy Point in Saratoga Passage.

This is a popular feeding area for grays, so that is our guess - but there are also some minkes and a possible humpback around the area as well - S&H

Another international crossing to catch up with our resident
Orcas
, the
J-Pod
, in the Gulf Islands, Canada. J-Pod was moving a little faster than expected, so we ended up passing Stuart Island, WA and moving towards N. Pender Island, Canada where the "trailers" (the trailing members of J-Pod) were hugging the coast moving nice and slow. We were able to have excellent views the whole time, due in part because these Orcas decided to show off a little for us. There were many tail slaps, as well as constant playing by the
J-11 matriline
(which includes her 3 offspring,
J-27, J-31, J-39
) and J-11's sister (
J-19
) and calf (
J-41
). (We think the whole J-11 subpod was there! And a few other unidentified members of J-Pod.)

I could hear blowing as I was sitting in my hot tub at

6:30 this morning
. My guests went down to the pull out area between the inn and Lime Kiln Lighthouse and they said they were running along the rocks with the
[orcas]
right beside them. About six and one small calf - all headed north on the west side of San Juan Island.

We watched a whale blowing and diving about a mile off shore from Spee-bi-dah in Port Susan Bay.
Could not tell if it was a Gray
, but following a similar pattern of the Grays when in deep water. A little bit of back after each blow and a lot of back before diving. We first saw it at

2:05 pm
and last about

2:25 pm
.
