Orca Sightings for June 25, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
2pm to
3:30pm, J-Pod and some of K-Pod
spread out all along the south & west side of San Juan Island, heading north, last of the ebb tide & the beginning of the flood tide. K-14 & family hugging the shore, little K-42 active & kinda of leap- breaching! We saw J-26 Mike, mom J-16 Slick, along with J-42 (whose white patches are still a bit yellow-orange at a year old!), cross in front of Mosquito Pass, heading north on the west side of Henry Island. At first I thought J-26 might have been L-57 Faith, J-26 has that same tilt to his dorsal fin. If there is research on patrilines, it will be interesting to see if L-57 fathered J-26. I have seen a few other wavy dorsals that make me wonder about J-1's offspring!

Js and Ks and a few Ls
headed up Boundry Pass this evening, against the backdrop of Mt. Baker and the Cascade Mts. They spent the day on the West Side.

Met the members of
K-pod
out on the southwest side off of False Bay and got some great looks at that cute little baby again! Little K-42 (first spotted in just the beginning of June) was moving quickly, porpoising out of the water, trying to keep pace with the grown-ups! The
Orcas
hugged the island's coastline the whole way. The pods were spread out traveling the whole time - a few occasional breaches and tail slaps and a wave of a flipper from a male! Moving offshore we caught up to a few of the trailing members of
J-pod
.

Here's a little report from a fellow who recently started listening from the UK (late at night!). He made a nice 2-minute recording of the
orcas
that went up the W side today (not sure of pods) which I've uploaded to OrcaSound. You may want to share it with your listserv as it has some seriously loud whistles and a few close S1 and S16 calls. (Maybe J and K were present?)

From Andy Good, UK: I sent two more emails with mp3 recordings of several minutes each. One was a great one of all sots of chatter, calls and echo location as they passed limekiln. They seemed to have hung around the bay to the south then set off at pace to the north. That was just the combination of picture and sound I was hoping to get.

At

7:25
, I saw a
gray whale
heading from northwest to southeast about a quarter of the way between Langley and Camano. The whale was too far out to ID and was not doing any deep diving (or showing its fluke).
