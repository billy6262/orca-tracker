Orca Sightings for June 12, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We got a report that the [
orcas
] were seen along the west side (San Juan Island) heading north. By the time we departed they had made it past Turn Point and we intercepted them as they crossed in and past the southern end of South Pender and Saturna Islands.
J-Pod
sure has been moving! Another international trip, crossing into Canadian waters we were able to spend a solid 30 minutes or more watching J-Pod as they traveled northbound. The whales were steadily cruising but quite active again today! We were able to see a few breaches, lots of lobtailing, and one male who even rolled onto his back and showed us his belly and "waved" at us with his flipper!
