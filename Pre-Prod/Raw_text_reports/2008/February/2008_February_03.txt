Orca Sightings for February 3, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit and I went out and found the
Js
right at Navy Ch. just south of Active Pass and took them into active a bit. Every year when I see J1 and 2 for the first time I sure get the chills. Ron Bates said Js were seen at
dusk
near Tawassan.

Orca Network received a call from Marti Tilley of North Pender Island, B.C., reporting a pod of 6 - 7
orcas
in Swanson Channel, mid- channel, heading north off Mouat Pt. at

9:25 am
. The pod included 1 adult male.
*
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report that Jim Maya & Dave Ellifrit had found the above reported
orcas
& it's J pod! They had them at

11:05 am
heading north through Active Pass.
*
A pod of approximately 15 [
orcas
] entered Active Pass northbound at

11:15 am
. I watched them feeding for some 15 minutes off Helen Point before they entered the Pass. They were very active, with quite a bit of surface activity. It appeared to be the pod with 2 adult males. Once in the Pass, they travelled fairly directly through.
