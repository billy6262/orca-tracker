Orca Sightings for February 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
On our way home tonight from a great trip to Baja to play with the gray whales, we asked a ferry worker on board the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry if any grays had been sighted yet. He hadn't seen one, but said other ferry crew members saw a
gray whale
a few hours earlier - mid-afternoon, in Possession Sound!
