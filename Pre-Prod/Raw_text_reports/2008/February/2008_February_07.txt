Orca Sightings for February 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I heard about 10 minutes of
transient
calls on my hydrophones, OrcaSound (NW San Juan Island), this evening at about
7 pm.
I'll attach a small WAV file. The T call is followed immediately by the sound of a wave breaking on our shore. It is
*
quite
*
windy here this evening.
