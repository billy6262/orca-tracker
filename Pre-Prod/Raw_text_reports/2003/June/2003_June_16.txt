Orca Sightings for June 16, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I live on North Pender Island on the Canadian side of the Salish Sea. A pod of orca whales passed by heading north at approximately
7.45 pm
. At the back of the pack was what I assume was a male with a very tall dorsal fin.
