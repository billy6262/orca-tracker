Orca Sightings for June 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
They were travelling North in Swanson Channel, passing Mouat Point, North Pender Island swimming slowly, some tail slapping, some of what appeared to be fishing behavour. I saw 1 baby with two other adults, so am guessing at J pod? It was nice to see them swimming so leisurely; it looked like about 20-25 whales and they took 20 minutes to pass the house.
