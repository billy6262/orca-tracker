Entry 1:
On Wed 6/18 there was a dolphin swimming along by the

ferry from Mukilteo. Report from Jeff Williams, Langley.

The big news today is a gray whale in the Samish River, which is actually more like a slough, in Skagit County. The 20' juvenile gray whale has apparently been in the river since early Weds. morning.
