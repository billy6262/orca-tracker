Orca Sightings for June 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had the unexpected delight of seeing a youngish gray whale in Penn Cove. We were getting close to Coupeville wharf when it came up very near the boat--15 feet or so a couple of times, blowing and surface diving.

We saw whales (we think the pod with 2 new babies) on the S. end of Stuart Is.

The main report was of T14 in the Oak Bay area off Victoria in the afternoon. J's and K's going into the ST. of Georgia.

Js and Ks off of Kellet Bluff on Henry Island. Got some good photos of J 38, he is really growing. They really split for the river after that and had the great opportunity to be with T14 on my afternoon trip and at sunset. We were alone with him on the latter part of the sunset and saw two kills. He took one seal right at the surface.

We were watching J-Pod and K-Pod up in Active Pass. There were multiple breaches from one of the newest calves, J-38, born just this winter. We also had some close looks at Kiska and her subgroup-Cappuccino and Raggedy.
