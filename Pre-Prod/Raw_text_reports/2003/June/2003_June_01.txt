At Lime Kiln Park...a lone J (passed about 60' away from us), followed by what appeared to be Oreo and family. They continued northward. As they frequently do, the J's decided to do a turn-around and head south. Suddenly everywhere we looked were orcas breaching, spy hopping, lunging, and putting on a truly beautiful and magnificent show.
