Here's a quick rundown on the day. All of K pod, including K35, were present. All groups from L pod were here today too. All sprouters and fall babies (except L102, of course) were present and accounted for. L55 has a new calf! This calf will probably be L103. L85 is sprouting in a goodly way. The only two whales not seen by CWR today were L3 (~53 year old female) and L58 (23 year old male). We had a good look at these two whales matrilines that were all nice and tight and they were not there. We will NOT kill them off yet until we get a few more (or more) encounters. We left L pod heading south with the fleet near Salmon Bank. J and K pods headed north and we left them still heading north off Monarch Head around 1810. It was a very satisfying arrival day!

...Js & Ks in the early part of the day. The pods were close to the San Juan shoreline near Pile Point in a resting pattern traveling north. L-Pod was offshore near Hein Bank in two sub-pods, they too were resting. Yesterday,
June 3rd, J-pod showed up at Cypress Island's Tide Pt. at
7 pm
traveling south; they must have been up north in that rough water all day.

Just talked to Tom McMillen; and then to Candi Emmons and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research who have been out with K & L pods this morning - they report the wonderful news that L55/Nugget, has a new calf! They also spotted K35, one of the other new babes of the season. Things look good with everyone so far, though they still have a few more whales to confirm and identify before they can report on numbers and whether anyone is missing, but the preliminary news is great!

Great news...Ks and Ls are back! It seems there is another calf out there in L-pod :) way-to-go Nugget. The pods were close to the San Juan shoreline near Pile Point in a resting pattern traveling north. L-Pod was offshore near Hein Bank in two sub-pods, they too were resting.

It was a georgeous day out on the water yesterday, made even more beautiful by the presence of K and L pods. It was so much fun to listen to all the chatter on the radio as the other operators compared notes to see which whales had been accounted for. They sounded as excited as we were. We certainly started cheering on our boat when we found all 3 adult males, and the celebration continued as we recognized more and more old friends (and a few new ones!). It was a magical day.
