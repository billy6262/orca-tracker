Another great superpod day on San Juan Island. At around

5:00 p.m
J's and K's came down from the north, having passed by the westside going north just over an hour earlier. The L's came from the south (by way of Victoria, according to the whale watch operators.) They met just north of Lime Kiln, then came south. For at least an hour there was lots and lots of breaching, tail lobbing, tail slapping, pec waving, and general frenetic behavior--much of it very close in to shore at Lime Kiln. Many great photo opportunities. A flock of enthusiastic orca fans enjoyed the show.
