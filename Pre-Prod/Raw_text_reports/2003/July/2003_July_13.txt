Orca Sightings for July 13, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...early reports of a Super Pod passing Discovery Island heading East. But by the time we got on scene in the afternoon, J Pod & K Pod headed North along San Juan Island towards Pender, while L Pod scattered out in the Straits a couple of miles off Cattle Point. The water was almost glass! Had a really nice pass with Ino, who slow-swam the entire length of the boat. We had one of the new L youngsters with us, but not close enough to get an ID. At

4:00 PM
, Faith and the L's that were near Eagle Point headed towards the Olympic to join up with the rest of L Pod.
