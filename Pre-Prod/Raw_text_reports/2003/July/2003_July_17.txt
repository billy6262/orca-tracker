After hearing about all 3 pods being further south at False Bay most of the day, at approximately

4:20 pm
we were treated to the sight of members of K and L pod swimming north past the Center for Whale Research. At about

5:30 pm
, more whales were seen off Bellevue Pt, milling and feeding, then heading north toward the Center. By
6 pm
, the K & L whales we had seen earlier had turned around and passed the Center going south, meeting up with the rest of the whales, and all of them turned and headed south, passing San Juan County Park at around
7 pm
.
And at noon, we had a phone message from the Superpod down south - wonderful chatter going on, sounded like a good party! Thanks to Capt. Hollywood (or was it J1?) for the call!

What an incredible morning. We started out bright and early (
0930 hours
) and just before we got to False Bay, we had a minke whale working back and forth close to the shoreline. All 3 pods were working together fishing as they slowly moved from False Bay towards Lime Kiln. And these guys always seem to come up with something new that I haven't seen them do before. Today it was 2 things: first we had a sprouter observed moving very slowly near shore. When we put a zoom lens to see what he was up to, we saw what had to be a 40 pound chinook salmon balanced on the end of his nose! He must have balanced it there for a good 5-10 minutes (and yes we took pictures, so it's no fish story!) As we got ready to leave and head back to port, we were treated to a show of male royalty--Ruffles (J1), Mega (L41), and Faith (L57) all came up together. The boys were back in town! :) Most of the whales stayed along the west side between Cattle Point & Henry Island for most of the day. I last spotted them heading South along the West Side at
1900
hours. May I never lose my enthusiasm for these wonderfully inspiring creatures!
