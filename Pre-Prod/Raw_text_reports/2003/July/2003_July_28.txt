Wow - no orca reports for a day or two, & suddenly they're everywhere! I just saw on KIRO news a shot of a pod of orcas with calves that they filmed near Mukilteo sometime today.

Wow, after going cold turkey on no whales for 2 days, it was great having them back around San Juan Island. This morning we had to practically go over to Sequim to see J's & L's. One group spent quite a bit of time logging on the surface of the glassy calm water. Lots of salmon jumping, so plenty for the orcas to eat today! And talk about vocalizations! Wow! To end the morning we had L-55 (Nugget) and her new baby L-103 come over to the boat and swim slowly upside down under us! Tom McMillen and I were so excited we forgot to look to see if the baby was a boy or a girl! D'OH! Then the baby made a U-turn and gave us a second look before joining back up with mom. (
so which is it?!! sb
) As I write this,we have whales heading north up the West side of San Juan Island (
1545
).
