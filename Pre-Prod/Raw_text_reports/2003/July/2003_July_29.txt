Orca Sightings for July 29, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sue in Greenbank had seen them at
4 pm
in Holmes Harbor, heading out of the harbor.

A neighbor saw 4 of the orcas while kayaking - she saw them around
4 pm
as they were headed out of Holmes Harbor & toward Baby Island & Saratoga Passage.
*
We received a report from the Center for Whale Research (see below) and one from Captain Hollywood that all 3 Resident pods were off the west side of San Juan Island today, so it looks like the orcas off Whidbey this afternoon were probably Transients. We received another report of them just south of us, but lost track of them after they headed south of Greenbank - not sure if they went into Holmes Harbor or just across the mouth of the harbor and on south down Saratoga Passage. Keep your eyes peeled for them tomorrow - if they're the same pod of Transients that's been hanging around this year, they could even head south to Olympia (or back into Hood Canal?!).

A resident near Conway discovered the body of the Gray whale that wandered up into the Skagit River in June. It was up on a bank of the South fork of the Skagit, north of Conway.

We had almost all the whales today...except the L12s,L11s and L25. Thought I saw part of that group yesterday, and so did Tom McMillan.

Wow, is right! I couldn't believe it when they kept breaching, rolling over,etc. I only spotted four of them.

WOW! What a show we just witnessed in Saratoga Passage, north of Greenbank! I went out to look for the reported orca pod at about 1 pm, found them at approx.

1:30 pm
, moving slowly south, acting very stealthy and Transient-like. We saw 7 or 8 whales, one a small baby. As they neared our perch, they came closer to the Whidbey side of the passage (around
2 pm
or so). They went down for awhile, and then suddenly emerged with a whole new set of behaviors......breaching, tail-lobbing, pec-slapping, dorsal-slapping, backward breaches, cartwheels - ALL of them just continually throwing themselves out of the water for 40 minutes or more as we watched in awe, oohing & aahhing! - it was simply AMAZING! It was more active than Superpod behavior, yet it was just one small pod. At about

2:40
, they rounded the bend, still heading south into Holmes Harbor, on the Greenbank side of the harbor.

Just received a call from Judy McDougall of Camano Island - they watched 3 orcas traveling slowly south in Saratoga Passage at approx.

12:15 -
12:30
, off Madrona Beach (across from Penn Cove, Whidbey Island).

John from Nooksack Charters called in a report of a Minke whale this morning at
11 am
, foraging about 200' off Iceberg Pt, S. Lopez Island. He said it jumped out of the water once while they were watching - that's two minke breaches we've heard of recently!
*
Orcas off Whidbey again! Captain Hollywood (Dale Martinis) called at
10 am
to report orcas off Strawberry Pt, NE Whidbey Island, heading NE into Skagit Bay toward Mt. Baker. He reports a Mom with a young calf, and one, possibly two males. They are with a pod of about 7 or 8 whales, and think there may be another group nearby.
