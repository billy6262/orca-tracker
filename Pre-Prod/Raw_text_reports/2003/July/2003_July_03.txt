K's and L12's met up with the J's just north of Andrews Bay. They socialized and fed for awhile before heading south. This afternoon they apparently met up with the rest of the L's for a superpod out in the straits. This evening the whole superpod headed north up the west side of San Juan Island, putting on quite a show. They turned around just short of County Park and put on another great show going south, with lots of breaching, tail slapping, rubbing together in groups, etc.
As I was ready to leave Land Bank (about a mile south of Lime Kiln), I stopped to watch the last two females close to shore pass by. Right in front of me about ten yards off the rocks the two females stopped and raised their heads out of the water, not exactly in a spyhop, and just kind of stayed in that position. Then a very large male came up between them on his back with huge pecs held in the air, and, hmmm . . . to put it delicately, there he was in all his splender. Talk about shock and awe. He stayed on his back with his huge pecs and tail up (as well as other body parts) for at least 30 seconds, with the two females coming heads up from the water most of the time, rubbing against him. He then submerged a little a couple of times, then re-surfaced basically in the same position. When he finally showed his dorsal side, he turned out to be J1, Ruffles. I had just run out of film and hadn't bothered to reload since I was certain I had enough photos for the evening. Oh, well. Not bad for an "older gentleman" - Go J1!!!!! we need more calves...sb
Another great evening!
