Orca Sightings for July 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We followed J Pod, north along the west side of San Juan Island finally leaving them as they headed toward Henry Island around
1545
. They were mostly cruising along and checking out possible feeding spots in the rip areas as they headed north all afternoon.

L-12's 3 miles off Lopez Island. They later went into speed mode as they fished and headed towards Cattle Point to meet up with the south-bound J's. As they closed in to the J's, the vocalizations became very loud!
