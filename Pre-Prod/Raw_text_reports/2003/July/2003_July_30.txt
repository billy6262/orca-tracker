Orca Sightings for July 30, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our neighbors reported seeing the pod of transients pass North Bluff at

2:30
this afternoon, heading south, just before I found them a little further south at the entrance to Holmes Harbor.

The much-heralded transients slipped past Langley between

6:00 and
7:00 pm
, heading toward Camano Head. Brian Lowey Langley, Whidbey Island
*
Cindy Hansen of Mosquito Fleet reported the pod of Transients still heading south in Saratoga Passage at

6:05 pm
between Saratoga Beach and Langley, being very active. She was able to get some photos and may have a positive ID for us soon - but it certainly looks like Transients.
*
Lots of whales (too far to get an ID today) passing by San Juan County Park heading North around

2:30 PM
. Then around

5:45
they headed back South, but this time they were out in the middle of the Straits. Hope this doesn't mean they are disappearing out to the ocean for a few days!

L12's maybe inbound from Sooke at
1800
. All the rest off San Juan Is. Your whales off South Whidbey Is. become more interesting re off shores or transients.

I found the Transient orca pod again at about

3:20
this afternoon. They had gone into the entrance to Holmes Harbor, & were heading back out when I first saw them. When they got to the Baby Island/East Pt area, they milled and circled back & forth, probably feeding off the seals.

Nancy Nolan called at

4:20
to report the orcas off Baby Island - I hope many others out there in OrcaLand will get a chance to see this pod too!

2:45
- Just received another call about the orcas in Saratoga Passage, this one from Jerry Mercer just south of us on North Bluff, Greenbank, Whidbey Island. The same orca pod is now heading south toward Freeland.
*
The orcas reported earlier headed over toward the Camano side of Saratoga Passage at around

9:45 AM
, continuing northward. We watched as they neared the northern tip of Camano Island, and it looked like they went NE up into Skagit Bay, where they were reported yesterday morning at around the same time. So hopefully they will turn around and come back down Saratoga Passage again this afternoon - all of you folks on west Camano and east Whidbey Islands keep your binoculars and scopes in hand, and let us know if you see them!

9:30
They're baaack! Just received a call from Mary Pacher, a bit north of us on North Bluff, Greenbank, Whidbey Island, and the pod of 8 orcas with a calf are back, headed north.
