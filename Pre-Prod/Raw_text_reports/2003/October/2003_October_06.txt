Orca Sightings for October 6, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I noticed, at the San Juan Is. camping-ground, all the boats moving quickly down to the Lime Kilm in the morning, so I knew Orcas must be around. I parked the car when I saw the pod right in the middle of all the boats, @ 80' away from the shore. ...Ruffles came swimming by, @ 20' away from the shore, scanning my energies. ...then @ dozen Orcas arrived in front of me, spyhopping, tail-lobbing, rolling, and swimming upside down...exposing their Hearts...the JOY was mutual. A few young-Orcas, almost touched my heart, just 7' away, as my ecstasy spilled over into their hearts but a granny came by swooping them away from rocks/shore & on to the rest of the pod.
