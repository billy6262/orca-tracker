Orca Sightings for October 14, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
... at Dilworth Point on the East side of Vashon island at around

5:45pm
They were moving mostly together with a few spread farther in front and behind I counted 10 or so with one large dorsal. It was the male that seems to have a bit of tilt the to the fin. Also spotted at least one baby traveling between several females.They were very close into shore - maybe 30 ft out and passed with lots of tailslaps, rolling and breaching. Just past Dilworth they joined a fishing rig that had its nets out. They then passed KVI beach by about

7:00pm
. I went to Point Robinson and they finally came into view at

7:45
ish. The air was so still that you could hear some of the vocalizations.
