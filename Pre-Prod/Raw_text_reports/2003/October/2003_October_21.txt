Orca Sightings for October 21, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported the L-12's were off Bainbridge Island at
noon
- this must be the pod sighted in Elliott Bay at 1 pm the 21st, and possibly the pod sighted off west Whidbey at 3 pm the same afternoon.

We saw orcas at about
1 p.m.
in northeastern Elliott Bay, just off Myrtle Edwards Park. I'd guess there were about five (maybe more), and they were definitely hunting. They were right outside our window here. I'll let you know if we see any more. (I hope they didn't get too many fish; Elliott Bay is one of the most polluted places in this part of the world, and they were hunting just offshore where the CSO discharge comes out.)

I found the orcas off Lagoon Pt. (west Whidbey Island) at about

3:45 pm
. There was one male way out front, then another pod further back, at first swimming very close together, with another male and with what looked like at least 8 whales in the pod. They were making their way north, swimming mid-channel, and after 15 or 20 minutes, the pod spread out & became more difficult to follow. I watched for about 30 minutes, and last saw them as they were heading north, between Pt. Wilson & Pt. Partridge.
Also, we received more information on the whale reported in Budd Inlet near Olympia on Oct. 18th. The reporter could not see any white on the whale, & from the description & behavior, it sounds like it may have been the False Killer Whale that's been around the Sound lately...

...a call from Elsa Leavitt, reporting a lone, male orca off Bush Pt. at
3 pm
, slowly heading north - then this email came in reporting 2 orcas off Bush Pt - so there must be a small pod out there, either Transients or possibly one of the L sub-pods? I'll head over to the west side & see if I can find them, & those of you on NW Whidbey, get out your scopes & binocs & let us know if you see any fins!
