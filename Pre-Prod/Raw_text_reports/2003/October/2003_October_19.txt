Orca Sightings for October 19, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...we spotted about 10 orcas heading south from County Park at about

9:00 a.m
. today. I headed to Lime Kiln which was completely fogged in. After waiting about 20 minutes, the fog began to clear. The orcas were right in front of the light, several hundred yards offshore, foraging. They were part of L pod, including L 57 and L79. What we were watching was apparently a superpod, as more and more whales began to appear and forage in front of us, including a healthy looking pink calf. I did not see J1. Hopefully, he was foraging more offshore. I last saw orcas at about
noon
, spread out off Pile Point. Some were close inshore and others appeared to be several miles out.

Talked to Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research at approx.
10 am
and they had J's, K's & L57 off the west side of San Juan Island.

At around
2 p.m.
about 20 of the orcas that had headed south in the morning moved north slowly past Land Bank, then Lime Kiln, then County Park. I recognized some L's and K's. We last saw them just north of Andrews Bay. In the middle of a squall at Land Bank L57 and Raggedy seemed amorously involved, with 3 to 4 juveniles also in attendance.
