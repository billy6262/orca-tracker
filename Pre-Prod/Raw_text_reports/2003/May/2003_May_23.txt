Orca Sightings for May 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...did anyone report seeing orcas off the East side of Sinclair Island last Friday (23rd) around
2pm
? I got a great picture of one spyhopping and there was one fiesty orca breaching a few times.

- Whales off South Beach, south side, San Juan Is., headed up the island. In twenty four hours, J Pod has gone from False Bay, up past San Juan, Stuart, S. Pender Islands, through Active Pass, down the Sts. of Georgia, past Orcas, Blakeley, and Lopez Islands and back to False Bay! Amazing!
