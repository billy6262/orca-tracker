Orca Sightings for May 21, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
A very relaxed visit with parts of J pod. J1 under the boat J2 rolling off the bow. And the cookie bunch J22 et al. This was N. of Lime Kiln from
1500 on to 1600
but still S. of Kellet Bluff. Last I heard they were going N. slowly.

This morning at

11:00
a single gray whale came close to shore past Tulalip Shores. On the same course as we witnessed last night, the gray went right on past us on a dedicated course to Spee-be-dah, where finning and feeding behaviors were displayed. Could it have been the same one as last night, back again to feast off Spee-be-dah? The whale left the feeding grounds about

12:30
and headed back south again, about a mile offshore.

The

6:30 a.m
. boat leaving Clinton was lucky enough to have one large gray whale pass very close this morning on the N side of the boat just before we left the dock. The whale was traveling east out of Saratoga Passage surfacing many times along the way before making one deep dive with a great tail fluke right next to the boat.
