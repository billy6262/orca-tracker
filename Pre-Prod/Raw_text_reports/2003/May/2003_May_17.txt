Orca Sightings for May 17, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got a quick instant message from a friend of mine in Coupeville of 4 gray whales heading out of Penn Cove (Whidbey Island) around

6:50pm
tonight. She isn't positive but said it looked like one on them was a baby.

We'd like folks along Saratoga Passage to be on the lookout for a gray whale wrapped in a crab line & trailing an orange buoy (it appears no crab pot is attached, & the whale seems to be swimming normally). Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called to report this whale at
5 pm
, swimming between Camano Head (S. Camano Island) & Hat Island, heading NW up into Saratoga Passage.

Mike Bennett also reported J pod off Lummi Rocks, headed south at
1330
today, and a pair of grays this morning off Langley.
