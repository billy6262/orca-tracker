8:45 am
- Jeff Hogan called to report J pod heading north at Lime Kiln Lighthouse, then said it looked like they may be getting ready to change directions and head back south. He also reported that he could hear 2 whales wheezing - J8 has always had a "wheezy" blow, but this morning he heard another whale with a wheezy blow as well.

Jeff Hogan called again at

12:20
to report J pod south bound near Eagle Pt, very spread out with J1 in front, and the new calves following. He saw J39 breach, and said it looks like a boy.

...on the
4:35 run from Tacoma to Tahlequah at about

4:45
I saw 3-4 orcas, swimming towards the Tacoma side. We only saw their fins and some black and white spots. We saw them for about 2-3 minutes (the ferry did not stop) they didn't jump or dive. It looked like they were on the move to somewhere. Sorry I can't provide more information - but folks should be on the look-out in this area.

Jpod In southern Haro St. most of the day. Also Dall's and Minkes back in the southern St. so the disruption did not last too long. Did not see J2 breech but J1 did while I was with them this afternoon.

At

7:15am
, a single gray passed by, heading south, just offshore here at Tulalip Shores. The water was very calm and several surfacing "footprints" were visable as the whale swam by.
