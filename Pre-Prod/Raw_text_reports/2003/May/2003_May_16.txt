, two grays came north into Port Susan, close in by the bouys here at Tulalip Shores. They headed for Spee-bi-dah, one of their favorite feeding spots in this area, but didn't stay and feed there. At -3 tide about then, alot of whale bites where evident in the sand. The two grays headed back south, swimming very much in tandem at a slow but deliberate pace.
