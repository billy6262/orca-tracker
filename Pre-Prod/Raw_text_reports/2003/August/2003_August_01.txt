Orca Sightings for August 1, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We got a call from Capt. Hollywood and Mosquito Fleet this evening, the transients were right at Hidden Beach, Greenbank, heading south in Saratoga Passage. We got to the bluff and found them at about

5:30 pm
, and watched them until they were headed past East Pt. at
6 pm
, continuing south toward Langley.

And from Cindy Hansen, who has been lucky enough to get some ID shots of the whales:
Hi Susan and Howie,
I got some pictures back of the Saratoga Passage orcas and I'm pretty sure it's the T46's plus a few friends. They seem to be getting more and more fond of this area. An interesting note is that they showed up within a few days of California Sea Lions returning to Everett. They also have a tiny little calf with them that appears to be no more than a few months old. I've never seen one that small. We saw the T46's in April off Mukilteo and there was no calf then.

Sally Slotterback called to report the Transient orca pod off Snakelum Pt. (just south of Penn Cove, Whidbey Island) at
3 pm
, heading south.
*
Four adults and two youngsters (orcas) sited in Penn Cove today from approximately
12 noon until
1:30
. According to my husband, it looked like the adults were teaching the youngsters to swim and fish. They were swimming around and jumping. This is the second summer we've spotted orcas from our front yard. Since we are new to the island we'd like to know if they usually show up in Penn Cove this time of year?
