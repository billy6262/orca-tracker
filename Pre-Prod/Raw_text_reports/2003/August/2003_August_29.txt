Orca Sightings for August 29, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Capt. Hollywood called in a report from Eagle Pt, west side of San Juan Island, at

1:45
with all three pods, moving slowly northward. He let the whales do the talking from then...
*
At around
noon
all three pods again came north up the island, close in to shore, socializing as they came. About an hour later they all turned around and came back south, again close in to shore. Coming south there were a lot of breaches, tail slaps and spyhops. When I left the orcas at about

7:30 p.m.
, most were foraging slowly southeast along Hannah Heights, but some were offshore and seemed to be headed in a more westerly direction.
