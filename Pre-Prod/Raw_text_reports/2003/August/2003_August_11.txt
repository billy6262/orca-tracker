Orca Sightings for August 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
K's were putting on quite a show on their way from Middle Bank east towards San Juan I. - what looked like Cappucino (sprouter K male) swam upside down beside our boat for a while, displaying his male splendor for all to see. Yes we were impressed.

Last week we had some wonderful encounters with the False killer whale at Point Roberts. Wilma or Willy had returned from travels as far as possibly Juneau, AK. She was not shy and started following our new boat immediately. However, she has not been seen for several days. Has she moved further south?
