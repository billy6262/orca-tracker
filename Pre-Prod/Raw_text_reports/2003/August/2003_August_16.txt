Teri Kobzan reported what looked like all three pods off Pt. Roberts
at noon
, for about 2 hours - very active, lots of splashing & breaching.
*
10 am
- Capt. Neal of Capt. Jack's Charters called in a report on the Transients (they were out watching as we were watching from shore off Partridge Pt, west Whidbey Island). They reported 4 orcas, 1 male, 3 females, eating seals in a bloody feast, and heading north. They later identified them as the T7's, with the male having the top of his fin bent over to the right, rounded and floppy.
*
10 am
- The 4 orcas did some porpoise-like activity, seemed to be fishing and then headed back north of Pt. Partridge.

10:30 am
- I found the whales just off Partridge Pt at Libbey Rd. Park, quite close in to shore. One male with a HUGE, thin & somewhat wobbly fin, and several others that looked like females or juveniles. I watched from

10:30 -
10:55
as they milled off the point, heading south, then north, then in, then out, finally heading a bit south and too far out from shore to really see much. By noon, they were way out, off the south end of Smith Island.

10:20 am
- Nasus reported a pod of whales in front of her house on West Beach, a mile or so further north of Pt. Partridge. They also saw 3 or 4 whales, with one male, but they said at
11 am
the pod was still close to shore and heading north; while the pod I was watching by that time had headed further out and was heading south. We tried to find this other "mystery" pod, but never did. It doesn't seem likely that we could both be seeing totally different things at the same time from the same pod, but then we never did locate the other pod.....so not sure what this means - just another whale mystery!!
*

10:45 AM
- pod sighted one mile North of Partridge Point (approx. end of Darst Road) and headed slowly North, feeding, approximately 1/2 mile offshore West side of Whidbey. There are two calves, at least one female, and one large male.

11:35 AM
- pod moved offshore to the Partridge Bank, approx. 1 mile North of Partridge Bank and 1-2 miles offshore. There are two green navigation buoys North of the Partridge Point buoy. The most Northerly of the two marks Partridge Bank and the whales are working back and forth in this vicinity. At this distance, good binocs or a spotting scope are needed to observe from shore.

We saw them in the vicinity of Smith Island. Typical transient-like behavior with long deep dives. There were a few tense moments as it looked like they might head right to Smith and feast on Harbor Seals, but they went right past it and starting heading out west. No id's yet, hopefully some pictures will turn out. There was one male with a bent over dorsal fin like L57's, 2 females and a youngster maybe 4 - 6 years old.

An absolutely incredible day today with our black and white friends of J & K Pod (in my top 5 for sure!) We first saw the K's around Monarch Point (Saturna Island), and they were very spread at first, then came together for a huge display of breaching. A brief respite allowing us all to catch our breaths and then Ruffles (J-1) lead J Pod by the boat. A lot of porpoising and several groups passed right under the boat.

3 - 4 orcas, between Pt. Partridge and Ebey's Landing (west side of Whidbey Island) seem to be fishing and slowly heading south. One male, one small baby-size and 1-2 others. Transients...?
