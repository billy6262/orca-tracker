Just as the tide changed around

6:20 p.m.
a pod of about 30 whales came down Georgia Strait, around the corner of Tumbo heading west down Boundary Pass - almost as if in formation. It seemed as if there were several pods (J & K I think) hanging out together. They appeared to be herding the fish, with sentries flapping on the sides with the Mama's and their babies coming along behind. As they came around the corner of the reef, some of the whales were close into shore, others were heading toward mid channel. In general the pod was moving west leisurely, with the young ones jumping and spyhopping, and with lots of fin flapping.
