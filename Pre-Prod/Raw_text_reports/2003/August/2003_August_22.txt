2:00 pm
today we were with T18, T17, & T19's (?) off Stuart Island while the other boats headed off for L's, J's & K's. There was very little direction change as the T's headed north toward Turn Point, staying app. 1/4 mile offshore and moving along in the flood tide at about 5 knots. As soon as they reached Turn Point, two tankers were making the turn enroute southbound. At about the exact time one could draw a straight line between the T's and the tankers, the whales dove and appeared a few minutes later just off the beach and a little south of Turn Point, but still heading north, very slowly and mostly on the surface until the tankers passed. After which they headed back out to almost the exact line they were on prior to the tankers.

Your reports of whales off Whidbey Is. this evening are most interesting. I left T18 et al in Boundary Pass at
1600
going NE after most, if not all L's had gone past East Pt. into Georgia St.

4 Orcas one very large male passed Lagoon Point headed north. (west Whidbey Island) My neighbor spotted them very close to shore but by the time he got hold of me they were to the far north end of Lagoon Point area.

, Tracy & Kathy Diller called to report a pod of 4 orcas off Keystone Spit, Whidbey Island. They were approx. 1/2 - 3/4 mile from the shore, just SE of the ferry landing, heading either out further toward Pt Townsend or maybe to turn north along west Whidbey. From the fin description (male's dorsal fin bent to the right, also one of the female's dorsal fins leaning to the right) it sounds like the Transient pod reported Saturday off the west side of Whidbey, tentatively ID'd as the T18's -
