============================================================

Entry 1:
A minke on the way to Race Rocks, and a Dall's with a very ragged dorsal fin.

*
Minke Whales in 5 different locations, miles apart from each other. (Juan de Fuca and Rosario Straits) At one point I thought I had found the missing Killer Whales when I came upon a "pod" of Minke's surfacing all at once.

2 Minke whales were feeding out on Hein Bank, and we came across 3 more minke's actively feeding at Salmon Bank.
