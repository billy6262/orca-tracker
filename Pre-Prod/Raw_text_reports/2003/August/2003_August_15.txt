We heard orca calls on the car radio at our house on the west side of San Juan Island at about

7:20 p.m
. We found the orcas at County Park. There were at least two large males, two babies, and many females or subadult males. L57 was definitely one of the males. Other people had seen the orcas breaching and foraging at Land Bank. When we saw them, they were speeding north.
