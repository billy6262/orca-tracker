K's at
9 AM
heading north along the south side of Stuart Island. We got ID's, all but K18's were present, and accompanied them into Swanson Channel until
about 10
. All were active, lots of spyhops and synchronous blows, among the breaching pink salmon.

We heard that K Pod was up near Saturna, slowly heading towards the Fraser River. We left K-Pod still heading North just at Point Roberts.
