Orca Sightings for August 13, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
The main event was a second "mugging" of a porpoise just S.E. of Race Rocks. Just who is unknown but some whales with "Jpod." the encounter was nowhere as long as the Haro St. one.

Whales here! Lots of them heading south along the west side of San Juan Island.

7:20 to
8:00 PM
with a beautiful sunset behind them. I am located about a mile south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. They were strung out, leaping, breaching, slapping the water with their tails and having a great time.
