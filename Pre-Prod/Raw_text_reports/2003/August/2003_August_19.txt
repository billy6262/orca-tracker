Orca Sightings for August 19, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went out with Tom McMillan's afternoon cruise to find the transients that had been found earlier near Race Rocks. We got on scene when they were about one mile south of Beaumont Shoals to find T18, T19, T19b, and T19c doing a mix of open water foraging and non-directional travel behaviour. We ended up leaving them about 1.5 miles south of American Camp on San Juan Island heading east. Unfortunately I saw no obvious bloodshed or carnage but there were quite a few Dall's porpoise that were fleeing the scene at one point.

Jessica Cousteau called in a report of Transient orcas 2 miles south of Discovery Island near Victoria at

2:30 pm
. They were ID'd as the T-18's: T19, T19B and a new calf with T19. More were seen by others, including a large male, with a total of six orcas seen earlier.

At around

7:00 p.m
. six transient orcas, identified by boat operators as the T18's, began chasing a minke from Salmon Bank towards Smith Island. I watched the chase for at least half an hour. The minke appeared to stay about a mile ahead of the orcas, as it porpoised for its life. It was surfacing fairly regularly at between 18 to 24 second intervals. The orcas porpoised rapidly after it. One male orca seemed to be able to keep pace with the minke better than the others. It looked to me like there was at least one juvenile back with pack. I left at around
7:45 p.m. when it became too difficult to see, so I don't know how the chase ended.
