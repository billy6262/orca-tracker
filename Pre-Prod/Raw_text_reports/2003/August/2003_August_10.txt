Orca Sightings for August 10, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
K's and L's were quite active along San Juan Island's West Side. Traveling in mixed groups of 8-10 whales, the big fellows seemed quite content to visit a lot of the boats today. It appeared that they practically bumped one of the smaller boats! Lots of fish jumping again, so hopefully the orcas are getting their fill!

I just got back from a cruise with a group of Antioch University students. As I was returning to the Island (Whidbey) from Friday Harbor, I saw a lone minke off Iceberg Point, South Lopez. This was about
1245
today. He (she?) seemed to be just milling about feeding.

Whales again inbound just East of Race Rocks at
1046
. Whales going to San Juan Is. and off the west side all day. At
1612
a greeting line formed between the L's and J's and K's. Very impressive.
