Picked up T141, T141a, and T144 at

3:30
in Pedder Bay cruising the shoreline through the kelp. They finally made a kill in Parry Bay on a seal. T144 did multiple body slams and after 5 minutes of tossing this poor pinniped around they shared their prize as they continued to swim towards Haystock Island. The gulls were following them and feeding on the remains. It looked as thought they nabbed another seal at Haystock although this time without much commotion. I left them at

5:45
as they were still circling around Haystock Island.

We spent an amazing evening off the west side of San Juan Island with a group of about 20 very social Orcas that were perhaps Northern Residents. Several mature males, none that I could recognize. We got a call from Ron Bates and found them near Beaumont Shoals. We went out at dusk with some folks from the Center for Whale Research to ID them but the light left us and we couldn't find them. Late in the afternoon, Js, Ks and L12s were headed north up Swanson Ch., west of N. Pender Is.

I live on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. While out pleasure cruising with my wife today, we spotted three Orca's, swimming in the Minches between the Isle of Skye and the Outer Hebrides. The group was made up of one male, one female, and one calf. They seemed to be concentrating on swimming only, with no signs of feeding or playing. The male was at first, detached from the female and calf by about 500 yards, but when I turned my boat towards him, and came between them, the male moved in to be close to the other two. They showed no other sign of being affected by our presence, and continued to swim close to the surface, making only very shallow dives. The party passed close to my boat on the landward side , within half a mile of the shore, and within 50yards of the boat. Their direction of travel was due south down the Minches, towards Ireland and the Atlantic? This sighting was made on the 24th
August 2003 at 13.30 GMT. I attach a photo showing the male and the female, and ( I think ) the calf between them. This is my first sighting, but I have heard of another sighting about four weeks ago in the same area, but no further info available on that.I hope this is of some use to you, and I will continue to forward any further sightings.

...a lone minke whale feeding in the southern end of San Juan Channel. Just North of Lime Kiln near San Juan County Park we found L Pod very spread out, leisurely making their way South. Later, on the ride home around
6 PM
I saw L-Pod still along the west side just South of Lime Kiln.

We were fishing off south end of San Juan Island (Cattle Pass) and spotted another 6 Orca who were also fishing!! Then we headed home for Whidbey. I am not knowledgeable enough to detect the difference of pods.
