Orca Sightings for August 30, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We heard reports of J & K Pods slowly moving North from False Bay. We finally caught sight of the whales around Henry Island as we continued North. We also heard reports of tons of private boaters surrounding the whales, so it was no surprise that the whales did the old "head-fake" routine heading North at first, then turning South, only to turn North again. Once past Henry, a vast majority of the boats stayed around Mitchell Bay and the orcas continued North. Several spy-hops and a couple of "semi-breaches" by the baby orcas. We saw a couple of younger orcas trying to catch a ride in our wake as well. We left a mixed group of J's & K's heading North towards Stuart Island/Turn Point.

The J's and K's came across Haro mid-morning today, then went north up the west side of San Juan Island. They were close in to shore most of the way from Hannah Heights on. Ruffles, Granny and Speiden were leading the pack. At Land Bank one group of orcas was about 12 inches off the rocks, going through the kelp. Then, kelp streaming from them, three rolled over on their sides and checked out the crowd. Very exciting. The J's continued north. The K's turned back south and put on quite a show as they hugged the shoreline south of County Park. When I left K pod at
