Orca Sightings for February 5, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
At about

4:00 P.M.
Appeared to be two females and a baby (orcas) circling just north of Sandy Point in Saratoga Passage, near the Whidbey shore. Lots of birds. After 15 minutes or so I heard a sea lion bark, there was a bit of splashing and then a spout of red water. After that I saw a sea lion surfacing, and after awhile 3 more barks, with the sea lion swimming away. (maybe?) The orcas sort of melted away, perhaps drifting south?

Fran Morehead reported that at

8:30 am
this morning one pod of the Transients went past the Whitney Pt. shellfish lab, heading south; and later a second pod went by heading south as well.

We spotted the whales just south of Hoodsport at about

3:30PM
today. They stayed in the vicinity until about

4:30PM
and then headed north past Hoodsport. A large one went ahead and a few minutes later about 3 groups with three smaller ones in each group followed.
jacque king, Hoodsport
