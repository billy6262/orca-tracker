Heard of one male orca seen near Hoodsport around
1.30 pm
. Traveled from north to south by road on west side of canal. At
3.10 pm
saw 15 harbor seals resting in cove of Fulton Creek... very wary, looking around all the time. Pulled in further south at a good viewing spot to check for whales and another whale-watcher arrived from south saying two pods were heading north but a skiff with 3 persons was racing after them when they surfaced... he had camera hoping to identify the boat! At
3.58 pm
we stopped again nearer to Lilliwaup and were glad to see both pods of females and juveniles and/or calves and both T-14 and T-74 without a boat in sight! One small group of 4-5 (females, juvies and/or maybe two calves) were nearer the east side of canal just north of Dewatto with T-14 right behind. Numerous people started watching also and we all could hear the blows right across the canal even with the traffic right behind us. About
4.15 pm
we then heard blows close by and the second small pod, two females (.....or possibly one smaller male and a female... looked to be the same three as we saw on 20th) with baby in front this time and T-74 behind but nearer the center of the canal. Both groups were moving fairly quickly at first but then seemed to slow down in a more relaxed rythmn.... maybe having lost the trailing boat! At
4.46 pm
the two more adult whales with calf were staying near the west side and moving north and the others on the far side the same. T-74 seemed to be moving nearer the east side group. We drove ahead to Triton Cove and the "three-some" gave us one last sighting at 5.20 pm and almost dark. They were still moving north in an easy porpoising rythmn. We could barely see but heard what we thought were the east side group and/or the large males also moving slowly north. We never saw or heard them farther north after that.

Hi Susan and Howie
Another day of sadness, makes whale reports kind of mundane. But life goes on, 6-10 whales going West off French Beach (West of Sooke B.C.) at
0930
this mornin.
Best wishes

Today we saw our first Orcas. We were in Hood Canal crabbing when we saw a pod of whales from

2:30-
3:00
. They were in the middle of the canal between Potlatch and Hoodsport. We watched them travel north. They were on the move and seemed to be traveling at a pretty good rate. We saw five at one time and thought there was another. I believe we saw one male, two females (?) and three younger ones(?).
I wonder if when we first saw them they were feeding only because the gulls were thick and diving at the water next to them. The male had a very large dorsal fin and I think it had some notches in it, although my wife isn't sure about that.

At around

14:30
today there was 5 of T-pod moving north from the Lilliwaup area. 2 in the front and 3 in back. Lots of spouting in the Lilliwaup area. As they approached mile post 323 three were all that was visible. 2 calves and what looked to be Pender in the back. Pender T-14 (if that was the same one, large dorsal with white saddle at the base) seemed to be on the look out for them since there was a boat in the area. No spouting just a continue move with only the dorsal fins coming out of the water. I will also note that on 1/29 I did see 11 around the same time of day in the same area with a lot more aerobatics.
