I saw what appeared to be a dosel fin of a female orca off the mouth of the Dukabush river. It was moving north at its normal traveling speed,in a straight line.

Five Orca just passed by in about the middle of Dabob Bay, headed north

fast.

One was very large, no marks in his tail that I could see, four medium. Possibly two tiny ones but were blocked by the larger ones. Then they went down for about four minutes. They are still out there. A boat passed respectfully at 300 feet, slowed engines as soon as saw Orca.

We were out racing today and saw what appeared to be 3 transients heading West throught Baynes Channel heading towards Trial Island. The male looked quite large and they were travelling at about 5 knots. Thanks for all the sightings reports.

We just watched at least 8 Orcas (a neighbor with a scope thought he counted 12) heading south along the west coast of Whidbey Island, about 1 mile out. The sighting began just after

12:00pm
from Ebey's Landing. There were at least 2 large males, and what appeared to be one or more females with with babies - we saw large and small dorsal fins surfacing together in a consistent pattern. They were spread over a large area, maybe feeding as they headed south. We observed them for about an hour as they slowly made there way south, beginning south of Pt. Partridge, until we lost sight of them between Keystone and Pt. Townsend. What a treat!
Thank you.

About a dozen orcas hanging out between Partridge Pt. and Ebey's landing (west/central Whidbey Island) about a mile or 2 out...some tail lobbing and perhaps slowly moving south.
