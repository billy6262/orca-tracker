Orca Sightings for February 12, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...just north of Lilliwaup. At

2:40 pm
saw a pod moving north up the canal. Through my binoculars I saw one or two adults (one smaller one?), and five or six young.

Hi Susan,
About

1:00
... a baby orca surfaced about 10 to 15 feet from the shore. ... While we were watching them heading north.

I found the whales at

3:50 pm
, milling around between the NE tip of Camano Island and Whidbey (south of Coupeville). I drove further north, and watched them from Harrington Lagoon at

4:10 pm
(just south east of the entrance to Penn Cove). By then, they'd turned around and were heading south. I saw one male, who I am pretty sure was J1, and approx. 6 whales total at that point. ... they passed between Cama Beach and North Bluff (Greenbank, east Whidbey) at
5 pm
. There were several tight groups, some lob-tailing action, and more good looks at J1 - we counted at least a dozen whales and are pretty sure it was J pod. Howie watched until about

5:30
, and they were still heading south down Saratoga Passage, closer to the Camano side.
