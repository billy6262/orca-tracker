Orca Sightings for February 10, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
At

5:20 P.M.
, under a colourful sky, 4 Orcas and 1 calf passed through calm waters, 20 yds. off of Gowlland Point, heading in a south/westerly direction. They stayed on the surface - some tail-lobbing.

today, three Orca went by, headed North, REALLY fast, just exactly side by side, all the same size, in and out of sort of like someone swimming the crawl. This was in Dabob Bay in front of my house, between Whitney Lab and Pulali Pt. No boats because it's a work day. In the five weeks the T's have been in Hood Canal/Dabob, I have never seen the 'T's travel that quickly, nor seen a three-whale same-size group.
Then, suddenly, they submerged and didn't come up while my patience lasted. Dad and I figured they must have been chasing something, then submerged maybe to catch it?

Hi Susan. Spotted a couple of females with two calves and possibly one other at about
4.30pm
traveling northeast from about 20 yds off the east side of the Pt. Whitney beach. (122 degrees 51' west longitude and 47 degrees 46' north latitude). Only surfaced briefly and then just disappeared. At
5.07pm
T-074 came out moving south of the buoy at the entrance to Dabob Inlet, then followed a female and baby and in close proximity to them another female and possibly a juvenile and a baby. They were moving fast and then T-074 broke towards the east side of Dabob and they all followed. They kept surfacing quickly and close together and babies right in there! They were heading to about the same area we saw them last thing yesterday but more north of Camp Harmony (about 122 degrees 49' west longitude & 47 degrees 46' north latitude) They seemed to mill around a lot with some spouting but the wind blew the steam to the south quickly so could not positively say but seemed about at least six orcas in all. It appeared they were circling and I thought they were after something by their quick zig-zag movements, presumably after a seal. At
5.12pm
there was something went into the air that was either a seal or a baby breaching, as it was not big enough for an adult, and then some more churning around yet all moving nearer the shore and generally to the south. I did see a tail slap for the first time with these transients and at
5.21pm
they were still milling around with some very animated movements but it was too dark to see after that. I think I may have witnessed a successful hunt! I did see several seals moving into Quilcene Bay within a couple of feet of the shore before I saw the whales. I also saw a sea lion I believe as it was very dark skin and had no silver mottling like a harbor seal. It swam in near the surface and later swam back out after the whales had apparently moved north into Dabob.
Cheers ...
