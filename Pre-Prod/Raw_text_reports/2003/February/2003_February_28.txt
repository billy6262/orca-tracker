Orca Sightings for February 28, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jim Connolly called this morning with a report of the Transients off Ayock Pt. in Hood Canal at

8:30 am
heading north fast - 1 male, 2 females.
*

2:45 pm
Tom McMillen called this afternoon, saying they were driving along Hood Canal today and saw T14 coming out of Dabob Bay going south.
*
A number of people had witnessed both males and a number of females and offspring moving up Dabob Bay, apparently foraging along the eastern shore, and entering Dabob Inlet (122 deg 48' W Long & 47 deg 48' N Lat) perhaps 30 mins prior to my arrival. Around
1.00 pm
T-14 came out by the beacon marking the east point of the Bolton Peninsula... T-14 then started moving west along the peninsula shoreline towards Quilcene Bay but dove deep and maybe 10-15 mins later emerged beyond the west side beacon of the Bolton Peninsula nearer the center of Quilcene Bay (122 deg 51' W Long & 47 deg 48' N Lat). ... he showed up way out in the channel to the east of Pt. Whitney (122 deg 50' W Long & 47 deg 45' N Lat).
Cheers
