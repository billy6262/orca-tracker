What were they doing? Playing? Feeding (on what)?
Looks like they were just travelling... split into two groups for a while then recombined? Saw some spouts, and at one point they seemed to move crossways to the current, as if they found something to investigate or eat.
Were there any males (very large fin on their back)?
Hmmm... I certainly did notice some large dorsals... might have been 2 or 3 of them.
Any unusual markings? Scars?
Too far away...

A few times over the years...
Did you get photos that may identify individuals?
Nope

We saw 3 orcas in front of Hoodsport today Feb 3 between
9AM and
9:30AM
. It was a beautiful sight. One whale was an especially large one. They surfaced, blew, and one seemed to have come completely out of the water in a magnificant leap. It was like they were playing.

The group of transients with the huge male with unnotched tail, 2 females, and unknown # calves (best as I could tell through scope) spent the night here, directly below our house (at

4:00-
4:30
they were headed rapidly north). When I finally had to give in to bed instead of miracles, it was

3:30 AM
and they'd been in this area almost 12 hours).

Hi Susan!
Well I finally got to see our fine finned friends again today, Feb. 3rd, at

9:45AM
at Holiday Beach (Hood Canal). A large pod was moving north up the canal! I was on my way to work, so didn't have time to turn around and follow them for better identification... hopefully someone else did!
Thanks,
Jeni Gray

At approximately

9:30 am
there was a group stopped at Glen Aire in Hoodsport that had spotted several did not hear the total number that were frolicking in the water heading South. Could not stay to find them but did see a number of sea gulls over the water with 2 kayakers. They did say that Pender and about 3-4 others were there. Again sorry about the incorrect information from Saturday stating it was today.

Susan,
Spotted four or five whales near the north end of Vashon in the waters between Vashon and Blake island at a leisurely pace at
about noon
. I spotted one of the whales afterwards further north leaving the area. I didn't see the other ones.

And we received this message at

1:15 pm
: Hi Susan and all,
I'm very pleased to post my first sighting since I've been in a place with a good view of Puget Sound! After reading about the orca sighting off Vashon, I looked out and there they were! Just lost sight of a group heading north between Alki and south Bainbridge Island. One male for sure, a few females too, pretty spread out. Couldn't get much detail because they were over near the west shore. Mark Sears was following them, as were a couple kayakers, and it looked like a news helicopter was scoping them out from a reasonable altitude.

Hi Susan,
I got a hotline sighting of 12 to 20 orcas heading north past Olalla (west of Vashon Island, on Colvos Passage) at

10:16
this morning. Our caller thinks she saw more than one male.

Susan, Just to let you know that we saw Pender (T14) again today. He was heading north down Hoods Canal at

11:30
by himself. That was again at mile post 323 at Lilliwaup.
