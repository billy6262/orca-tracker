Orca Sightings for February 27, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
The orcas stayed in Quilcene Bay again with little action to be seen from Pt. Whitney. They had not left again by dark... maybe a good place to dine and stay-over!

Ken Balcomb reported J pod going north past the Center for Whale Research at around

4:30 pm
, and Candi and Dave from the Center sent these two reports:
6 pm
- Dave (Ellifrit) and I were on the way back from Roche Harbor (NW side of San Juan Island) this afternoon and ran into J pod, very spread out, heading north. We found them in Mitchell Bay, and we saw J1 get a fish.
Candi Emmons
7 pm
- We are listening to J pod as I write this. Calls started a bit before 7 pm, and are fairly distant. So maybe they aren't going north after all.

Judy Dicksion called to report a pod of Transients, including T74 and possibly T14, heading north up into Dabob Bay this morning between
10 and
10:30 am
. There apparently was a Navy ship up in the Bay, and part way into the bay the pod turned around, went south and then back up north into Quilcene Bay.
