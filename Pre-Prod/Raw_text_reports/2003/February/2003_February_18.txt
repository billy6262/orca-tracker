Orca Sightings for February 18, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
A gentleman from Quilcene who does not have Internet access stated that yesterday evening (2/18) about 6 were hanging out just offshore from the Quilcene Marina, where the West Coast Oyster Company is. He says that is a big gathering place for seals because the Oyster Company is extruding

I just got to Pt. Whitney about
11.30am
and walked around to the east beach by the Shellfish Lab just in time to see some blows. Looked like large blows from both males, some medium ht blows and some small. Hard to say exactly how many as too far away and windy. The Shellfish Lab employees later told me that they had seen 12 orcas enter and leave Quilcene Bay prior to my arrival. They also said T-014 and T-074 were travelling together and that was quite a sight! I was just one step behind them it seems all day!.. Later I managed to see a few blows, large and medium, about six I estimated at the time. They were travelling fast in the center of the channel moving south between Pleasant Harbor and Scenic Beach State Park on the Kitsap Peninsula (122 degrees 52' west longitude and 47 degrees 39' north latitude) and quickly out of sight.

Finally - some Southern Resident whale reports! Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research on San Juan Island just called to say that they were with J pod, heading into Cattle Pass (south end of San Juan Island) going toward San Juan Channel at
12:10 pm today. There had been an earlier sighting of orcas off Bellevue Pt. at around
8:45 am, which most likely was also J pod. Ken also reported seeing two male orcas heading south at Salmon Bank this morning at
8:47 am, so that most likely is another pod, maybe L's, which could be nearing the west side of Whidbey Island right now if they continued heading south. So get your binoculars out and give us a call 1-866-ORCANET if you see them!
