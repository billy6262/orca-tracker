Orca Sightings for February 21, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:00-
2:30
: We just had the best show of the entire six weeks of almost daily Orcas "in our front yard." Yesterday(2/20), the

3:00-
3:20 seal lion hunt was tight and coordinated. Today, two very large Orcas (males?) swam in a huge circle of perhaps a half mile diameter. Within this huge perimeter, tight clusters of females and babies, 5-7, surfaced frequently. Tail slapping. The vocalization of a sea lion or seal. Rolling on backs. Spouting and spraying. The large "circle" started out in the middle of the western half of Dabob Bay, then gradually moved in towards shore so that it was about 100 yards away. This feeding and/or training session lasted, as yesterday, about twenty minutes to half an hour. Then the Orcas headed slowly south. About an hour after the Orcas moved south, a sea lion a little north vocalized repeatedly. Was it an "all clear?"
