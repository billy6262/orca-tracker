Hi Susan......I called in a report about
4.30pm
of seeing maybe three or four whales possibly hunting in Dabob Bay at the south end of the Bolton Peninsula (Long 122 deg 51' W & Lat 47 deg 47' N ... I think that's right). I reviewed my video and there was a female and a small calf (of which I also got a digital shot that seems to show a light marking on the female's left side of her dorsal fin.. which I'll attach) and perhaps a another juvenile....maybe a male. The older ones seemed to be moving quickly near the surface towards the shore... kind of like the resident orcas run salmon...I did not see T-14 or T-74 but one other whale was in the vicinity as I heard the blows nearer to Dabob's eastern side but only saw the fading blows and no actual fin.
