Orca Sightings for December 29, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Linda Taylor, a naturalist with the
Oregon Coast
Gray Whale Watch saw a group of ~4 whales which looked like possible orcas (large fins - she couldn't see the white on them, but said they weren't coming out of the water much) going north past
Boiler Bay
at

9:45 am
. She talked to a camper who also saw 4 - 5 orcas at Depoe Bay, 1 mile further north at
9 am
, also heading north.
*
Art Bradley called from up above Cape Foulweather (getting ready to do a gray whale watch) - around noon, he saw a pod of ~ 6 orcas heading north toward Rocky Shores (
Newport, OR area
). There is a small white boat with the whales, either a fishing or WW Boat? He talked to others who also saw the whales, & are sure they're orcas (he said they've seen them here before in April, but never this time of year).
