Orca Sightings for December 31, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approx.

4:30
Amy had spotted the orcas
off Dolphin Pt, NE Vashon
Island, and at
5 pm
she said they were still headed south.
*
I found whales
just inside the west entrance to Active Pass
at about
1330
. It turned out to be transients T31 (Y1), T87, T88, T90, T97, T124, T124b, T124b1 (?), plus about three others of various sizes that looked like they could have been related to T124. They traveled east thru Active Pass and then north up the Vancouver Island side. I left them at
1440
still heading north.
