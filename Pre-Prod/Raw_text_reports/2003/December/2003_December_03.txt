Orca Sightings for December 3, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched at least 5 but others said there were 8 orcas just south of the Vashon Ferry Dock. They came north and then followed our ferry which was going to Southworth. They seemed to continue north. Two of the whales seemed to be males as they were huge and their back fin was magnificent. There also appeared to be at least 1 small whale.
