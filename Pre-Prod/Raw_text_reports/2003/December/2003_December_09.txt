Orca Sightings for December 9, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
The footage (King 5 TV, Dec. 9) was of J-Pod....positive spotting of my very close and personal friend J-1 RUFFLES! :)

Didn't know if you watched the King 5 noon news but they showed Orcas off Alki. Did see a Mom and baby, couldn't tell for sure who they were though but I'm sure you'll get better reports later. :-)

Just saw some spectacular footage of the whales off Alki today on NWCN
