Orca Sightings for December 7, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Returning from a scuba trip in Rich Passage (SE end of Bainbridge Island) back to The Locks (Ballard, n. of Seattle) at dusk last night (12-7) and we saw at least one male Orca cruising the other way (SW) just northwest of Alki in the middle of the sound (may have been more, it was getting dark). Saw one spy hop and then they continued along their way.
