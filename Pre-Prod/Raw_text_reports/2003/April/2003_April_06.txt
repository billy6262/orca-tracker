Orca Sightings for April 6, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted the first Minke whale of the season! (-as far as we know) It appeared to be a juvenile and was traveling alone out near Cattle Pass. The animal surfaced close to a bait ball where the birds were feeding in a frenzy.

Regarding these three grays, Sal and I (and everyone else on our street!!) enjoyed watching them all day, from
11AM to about four
, when they seemed to move at a liesurely pace north and west toward Maple Point (Scatchet Head, S.W. Whidbey). What a beautiful day to be whale watching!!
