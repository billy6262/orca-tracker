Orca Sightings for April 3, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen caught up with The Whale Museum sighting report of J pod in San Juan Channel this AM. He called us and said that he thought there was a new calf, so Dave and I went out and caught up with J pod at Pt. Lawrence, Orcas Island (
about 1700
). The new calf is with J11, and we got some usable IDs so should be able to keep track of it. Thanks TWM and thanks Tom and Jim Maya, too. Good day!

At last Jpod, my first report was they were in San Juan Ch. going N. Off the dock at
1400
and they have now gone into Upright Ch. As we enter Upright Ch. they are in Peavine Pass. In Peavine Pass they are going N. in Rosario St. At
1535
contact 1 hr and 35 min's. into a 2 hr trip, going to be late. Only on scene for about 15-20 min's. The wonderful sound of J8, the new calf and J1 all there but time ran out.
