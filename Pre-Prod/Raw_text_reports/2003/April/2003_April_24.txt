Received a call from Louise Salmin that she'd been watching 2 gray whales in mid-Saratoga Passage from
7 -
7:30 ish
. She'd watched them from up near the northern end & when she called said they were headed toward East Pt (near the entrance to Holmes Harbor). We went out to the bluff & found them at about

7:45
- they were closer to the Camano side, just south of Elger Bay, & still heading south.
