Two gray whales passed within 100 yards of shore here at Tulalip Shores (north of Everett) at

5:50 pm
. They headed north to the beach NW of Spee-bi-dah, feeding briefly. They rounded the point north and out of sight around

6:30pm
. One was large, and the other did not show itself much, but appeared smaller. Likely this is the same pair we saw earlier today.

Gray whale sighting in Port Susan: ... three grey whales at

8:15 am
. We spotted them approximately 1/2 mile offshore from Tulalip Shores (north of Everett). One large whale was heading south. They didn't appear to be all swimming together, as the other two, one large and one small, were heading north. These two spent at least the next hour feeding along the coast northwest from Spee-bi-dah.
