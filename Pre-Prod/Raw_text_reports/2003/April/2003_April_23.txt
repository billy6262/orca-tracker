Orca Sightings for April 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two whales were seen from the

4:30
Mukilteo-Clinton ferry. They were first seen mid-channel, in deep water, right in the ferry traffic lanes. They were last sighted heading north towards Everett, heading closer to shoreline. They were blowing infrequently (we saw them surface only three times for the whole crossing), and seemed to be moving rather quickly. They were too far away for any identification.
