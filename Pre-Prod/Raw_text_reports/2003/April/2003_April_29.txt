Orca Sightings for April 29, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

8:00 this evening
orcas passed by Bush Point (west Whidbey), heading south. One large male close to shore and a few more farther out. At first I saw only one female farther out, but just after I finished calling in the sighting, I saw a couple more whales near her. And the male was quite separate. His dorsal fin was pretty wavy on the back side, from the brief look I had.

...a group of 5 orca very close to shore at North Beach (near Ft. Worden, Port Townsend) at

3:45
this afternoon. One very large male, two females and a third female with a calf were traveling towards Admiralty Inlet. We drove to Point Wilson and watched them awhile longer. After ten minutes or so they headed out a ways and appeared to be continuing to head into Puget Sound.

It's been a very long spell since we have seen any grays turn the corner and come into Port Susan. Around noon today my husband and I both saw one, maybe two, grays traveling south right along the east coast of south Camano Island.

5:00PM
. Just saw 2, maybe 3 grays spout out in front of the house (SW Camano Island). The tide is in so they were reasonably close.
