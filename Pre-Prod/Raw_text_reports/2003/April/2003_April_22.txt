On board the Snow Goose, we watched what appeared to be a false killer whale in Bellingham bay for about 20 minutes today at about
10 a.m.
It seemed to be staying close to a dragger (Larken). It surfaced five or six times, was 12 - 15 ft long and then followed the Larken as it headed out of the Bay. A real treat as we had 24 sixth graders from Blaine doing our school program.

I just returned from flying over the whales! J-pod came by my place earlier (west San Juan Island), and I went up with a friend to see them from the air. Pretty incredible looking down at them in the beautiful clear blue/green water. They were spread out along the west side of Henry Island with a few whale boats observing. It was about

2:30 PM
.

The theodolite tracking crew had J pod spread out and foraging (lots of breaches) off South Beach at
0615
today. We followed them as they grouped up and moved north. They moved pretty fast with the current past the Lighthouse at around
0820
. Had some positive ids on J2, J8, J1, J16, and J26.
