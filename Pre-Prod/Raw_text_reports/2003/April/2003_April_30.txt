We think they were eating. The sea lions in the area were up close to shore, we saw about 6 or 7 of them near the shallow waters in front of our house. We saw fins, blows, one whale breached the head and about half the body was out of the water.
Were there any males?
We think at least one or 2. We have seen whales in this area before but it was 7 or 8 years ago.
