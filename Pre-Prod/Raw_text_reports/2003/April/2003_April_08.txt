Orca Sightings for April 8, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Speaking of Grays...in the passage between Mukilteo and Clinton to as late as

6:40pm
three gray whales north of the Mukilteo dock (count provided by ferry staff, who seem to have been watching them for some time). From

6:20pm to
6:40pm
I witnessed at least two whales about 1.5 miles north of the Mukilteo dock moving slowly north past Everett.
