Noon
- Weve been watching at least two gray whales moving southward toward Possession park for the past 20 minutes, fairly close to shore. At least one is very large. Multiple blows in rapid succession make it likely there are two or more swimming very close together. Nice views of flukes. Diving for minutes at a time.
