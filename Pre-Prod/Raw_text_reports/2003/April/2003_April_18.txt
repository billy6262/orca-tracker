We received a call from Larry Sevick from a boat off the coast of Washington - he reports seeing a pod of 12+ orcas 8 miles off the coast, north of Grays Harbor,
April 18 at
7 pm
. He said the pod included at least 2 males, and it looked like their travel was trending northward.
*
Jpod in Haro St. all day. J1 was about 2.5 miles away from the rest and going N. this was just S. of Lime Kiln at
1455
. The calves look good. Another great Dall's show on the way home, they really look great this spring.

, a large gray with the recognizable striped marking on his flipper/fin (?) feeding in front of Bells Beach. Later that night at
2100
we heard a lot of splashing and the blowing and heard the inhale this time too of one feeding up at the beach again Did he come back for seconds?

J Pod was off the west side of San Juan Island most of the day. They came in from South Rosario this morning about

10:30
. We spent about 2 hours with them south of the Cattle Pass Lighthouse. Both new calves look real good. I got some great photos and will put them up as soon as possible. Both calves were together when we were with them and appear to be good buddies. Lot of feeding activity so there must be a good number of fish in the area. They were going north the last I heard at about

4:30
. J 38 has a very distinct eye patch, I will try and isolate it in a photo.

J pod spend a good part of the afternoon today off the west and south west side of San Juan Island. They were headed north about

11:30
and then turned around and stayed south. When we left them they were once again heading north at
1500
. That new baby with J11 was zipping right along!

John reported he was with one gray off Hat Island at about

12:30 pm
, and we have this report off Camano from this morning -
