Orca Sightings for April 12, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Saturday while on ferry traveling to Mulkilteo the captain made an announcement, spotting of a grey whale--we could see what looked like a smaller whale, body was visible and we also sighted a tail lob.

One lone gray sighted just south of Cultus Bay approximately
3PM
. Appeared to be lolling about feeding rather than travelling in an easily discernible direction.

We were on the
10 a.m.
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry today and saw a grey in the channel closer to Whidbey. Right in the ferry lane. Nice to have them back.

... a single gray whale finning and feeding off the NW coast of Spee-bi-dah (north of Everett). Blows were 45 seconds to one minute apart. I observed the whale from

10:30am until
1:00pm
, when it then headed back south, out of Port Susan. I'm wondering if this was the same single gray that I witnessed swimming in Port Susan yesterday.
