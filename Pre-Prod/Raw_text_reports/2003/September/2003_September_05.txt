Orca Sightings for September 5, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lucky day for whale-watchers yesterday (9/5) as we were treated to a greeting ceremony off west side of SJI (just north of Lime Kiln - about
1:30 pm) with J,K's lined up galloping towards line of L's who had just come in from the west. A most beautiful sight watching J,K's porpoising together in slow motion towards the L's! Stayed with superpod a bit as they made their way south along the island - noticed Ruffles (J1) with a couple of sprouters hanging close with him - i can only imagine the fish stories he must be telling them! THEN we lucked into seeing a small group of transients on the way home- (5 including a small calf, plus a large bull in the vicinity - perhaps T14 and his comrades?) - heading north in Rosario Strait (

3:30-4 pm) not far from Burrows Island. Most whales i had seen in one day, excepting the most unusual day last summer at the end of September when we saw the residents AND the offshores within a couple miles of each other....!

to say he found J & K pods at Turn Pt headed south - very playful, lots of jumping and action. He also had reports of L pod at Race Rocks today -

We received a call from Karen Eichler reporting a single male orca under the Deception Pass Bridge (between N. Whidbey & Fidalgo Islands) at
3 pm
, traveling from the east heading N.West. He was observed from North Beach, Deception Pass State Park. They had also heard the pod was sighted off Hope Island on Sept. 4.

9:45 am
to report the same Transient pod off Camano Island again this morning - they were 1 mile south of Rocky Pt (NW Camano Island) and about 1 mile off Madrona Beach. He said they appeared to be moving east toward the beach, but pretty much just milling with no real north or south direction. We'll keep our eyes peeled for them again today!
