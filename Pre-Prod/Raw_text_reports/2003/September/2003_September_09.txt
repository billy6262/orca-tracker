Orca Sightings for September 9, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Capt. Neal of Captain Jack's charters called in a report at
noon
, of J, K and L pods at Matia Island (off the top of Orcas Island) south bound. He said he's never seen so much breaching and heard so much talking all at the same time! All three pods squeezed through a tiny passage between Barnes and Clark Islands, breaching as they went through.
*
Whales were hanging around Cypress Island/Strawberry Island. We arrived on scene and observed L Pod (the L-12's were traveling separately), and J's & K's traveling together. The whales didn't seem to be in any hurry as they headed southeasterly. Even a Washington State Ferry got to watch whales! We left them rounding James Island.
