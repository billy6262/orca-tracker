An interesting note from Sept. 12 - purse seiners were out that day fishing in the same area the superpod (J,K,L's) was passing through in. As one of the seiners was getting ready to close up, a group of 6 orcas swam right into the net making their way north! They disappeared and surfaced on the other side - we then watched the seiner pull its net up after they closed, and needless to say, there weren't too many fish in that net! It's been an incredible week out there - every day I say it can't get any better than this, and the next day it does! September rocks....
