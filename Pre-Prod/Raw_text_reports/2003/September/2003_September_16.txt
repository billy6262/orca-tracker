Orca Sightings for September 16, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just wanted to report a whale sighting in Commencement Bay, Puget Sound, around

6:30 pm
. I spotted the animals (possibly 2 or 3) from my deck. First I thought it was a big seal, grabbed my binocs and saw it spout and a female orca-like dorsal fin! The largest animal was about 14-18 feet long. If you are familiar with the area it was about 300 meters north from the Browns Point Light House. We observed them for about 10-15 minutes. Hope we weren't the only ones to see them! After consulting our whale/dolphin ID book we think we may have seen a "wandering" false killer whale. Is that possible?
Thanks very much,
Diana Frick

Sandy Taylor (visiting from Florida) called in a report of a pod of 8 whales off Salmon Bank, including one male with a really tall dorsal fin, headed north. They also heard two pods of whales met in Rosario during the day as well.
