Orca Sightings for September 8, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Early morning had J's, K's & L's spread out from South of Lime Kiln to Open Bay (matter of fact I almost drove off the road when a whale spy-hopped near shore!) Later that afternoon we had L Pod & J Pod up near Saturna Island. Many of us observed the whales going around the Northern side of Blunden Island, but no one could recall seeing this behavior before. The whales were not very vocal, and just having a nice, semi-slow moving afternoon. The crystal clear waters made viewing the whales above and below the water easy. We left the whales passing Java Rocks heading towards Eastpoint. Once again, another nice day at Saturna Island!

All 3 pods mingling together past the Light House and last reports had them up at East Point still heading E/NE. Unusual for th L's to go the distance.
