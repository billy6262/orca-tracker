Orca Sightings for September 7, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
The T41's came back in the Juan de Fuca for at least the 4th time in 2 weeks. They were first picked up at around

12:00
at Secretary Island (off of Sooke Basin). They proceeded to cruise the shore line all the way into Race Rocks reserve. They had at least one successful kill here (around

3:00
). I got a call at around

7:30
that they were in Victoria harbour. They made it all the way to the fuel dock. Take note of T41 and T44's patented backward's roll.

Judging by some of the comments heard over the radio ("Outrageous!" "Incredible!" "Wow!"), I'd say yesterday would rank in most everyone's mind as one of the top 10 best days of the year for whale watchers. Skies were threatening rain, and did soak us for a bit, but the waters on the West Side of San Juan Island were flat calm and made for ideal whale viewing. And the whales did not disappoint. As we rounded Cattle Point (I could get used to having whales there!), we saw huge breaches off in the distance. Then L Pod (no sign of L-12's though) and K-Pod came right towards us. Not in any hurry, and in a definitely playful mood. More tail slaps by the entire group than I've ever witnessed. The sound of their breathing and slaps could be heard echoing across the water. Lots of breaches, including a mom & baby double breach! Some vocalizations. The whales made a giant, lazy circle just past Cattle Point and started heading in a Northerly direction again. As we prepared to leave, a lone minke whale lunge-fed right next to the boat, just about 100 yards from the orcas.

K and L pods were very tranquil today around noon. They were milling in the light fog from False Bay to Salmon Bank, all grouped tightly together. There was some resting but mostly just relaxing, spyhopping, calmly socializing with one another, just in their own little world. There were very few boats with them and everyone was behaving themselves. It was a peaceful beautiful experience.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales reported K & L pods off South Beach, SW San Juan Island at

2:10 pm
. They were headed toward Salmon Bank, after spending time in a resting line off Eagle Pt. earlier in the day.
