============================================================

Entry 1:
Time

. This is Ken (Balcomb) and Dave (Ellifrit) at CWR. We just returned from observing J, K, and L pods (minus L12's) go up Haro Strait and into Swanson Channel. The only new calf we saw was with K14. This may be the new calf that has episodically been reported since 20 September. Maybe there are others, but we didn't see any others in the groups we observed and photo-documented.

The L12's this afternoon going S. from Kellet Bluff. The calf is K14's.
