Orca Sightings for September 14, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
All three pods (J, K, & L) off the West Side of San Juan Island. They started off around the outer marker of Hein Bank, heading towards False Bay. The whales were quite spread out, and moving slowly towards the South end of San Juan Island. Without a doubt my best vocalizations day of the year---for over 15 minutes they vocalized in the waters near our boat! We heard distinctive J calls, as well as some calls from L Pod. I only wish I had a tape recorder so I could listen to them some more! We heard over the radio that a false killer whale was inshore near False Bay riding in boat wakes, but we didn't have time to go take a look. Lots of sea lions on Whale Rocks, enjoying the afternoon sun, and a few harbor seals showed their fishing techniques to us as we went by.
