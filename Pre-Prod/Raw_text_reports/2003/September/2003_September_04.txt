Orca Sightings for September 4, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
At Langley, Whidbey Island, about
9pm
. we saw and heard orcas. They were heading north. There appeared to be one large male and at least one or two others.

Cindy Hansen of Mosquito Fleet called again at about
5 pm
to report that the Transient orca pod was now heading south in Saratoga Passage, off Madrona Beach on Camano Island headed south toward Holmes Harbor on Whidbey Island.
*
Naturalist Debbie Barton came back from a tour at
2 pm
and said it was truly a whale day. Whales right outside of Roche Harbor, Kellet Bluff to turn point j, k, l, then went outside toward Sidney to be with J, who were on the outside of everyone else. Then came back to turn point, and k's and l's were there.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report J's and K's going past Lime Kiln Lighthouse, west San Juan Island at
11 am
. L pod was doing the "west side shuffle" between False Bay and Salmon Bank all day.
*
We spotted members of J-Pod heading our way, so we settled into the very calm waters near Monarch Head. Ruffles, Blossom, Oreo and the gang came by slowly. As an unexpected bonus, as we were leaving Saturna/Eastpoint, we found K-Pod heading right for us as well.

First a few here and there near Pile Pt. (San Juan Is.) We chatted with Soundwatch for a while, they told us it was L Pod. As we headed south they seemed to come from nowhere and all converged just south of Eagle Pt., headed for Salmon Bank where there were lots of boats fishing. Nice to see the few boats that were out there giving them lots of space.

Cindy Hansen of Mosquito Fleet called in a report of a pod of Transient orcas just north of Camano Head, So. Camano Island, heading north at

9:15 am
. She positively ID'd T14, and guessed the others were the T46's & T122's.
I was able to get out on the bluff (Greenbank, East Whidbey) and look for them later, finding them at

11:10 am
, just north of Cama Beach, still heading north. At

11:15
, all but the bull headed south for awhile, looked like they were feeding....I lost sight of them as they headed further north -

5? orcas going North in Saratoga passage at

9:45 am
. One bull bringing up the rear, one female far in the lead, and 3, (one smaller than the others) females together. A tour boat following along at a reasonable distance.
Dodie on Camano
*
Orca's at around

10:50 a.m
. south of us (Cama Beach) between Lowell pt. and baby Island. Watched them heading north and last spotted them at

11:15 a.m
. at the mouth of Penn Cove. There were four Orca's, a very large male, a very small baby and the last two we are guessing were females.

10:20 AM,
At this moment, J Pod and some Ls are off of False Bay, headed slowly toward Lime Kiln Park, San Juan Island...Rest of Ls and Ks are probably up north near Vancouver, BC.
