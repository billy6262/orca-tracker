============================================================

Entry 1:
Did anyone call in the sighting Monday morning

Hi Susan,
I received a message on the hotline this morning for a sighting from yesterday (Jan 6). At

1:30 pm
25 to 30 orcas were seen entering Dabob Bay. They traveled all the way into the bay and back out to the Hood Canal. There were at least 2 males with large fins.

SIGHTINGS OFF ALKI
We have been living in the West Seattle area for almost 10 years and have only been able to spot Orcas once very far away, until this morning. We were driving up Marine Drive North near the tide pool area when we spotted the first of a large group of Orca fins coming around past the Alki Light House heading southwest towards Blake Island area. By the time they moved out through the fog we estimated there were 15-20. They seemed to be moving as a herd very deliberately, taking their time. There were several smaller groups making up the whole. At one point they all submerged only to reappear a couple minutes later much farther out. It was "very cool" on such a beautiful sunny and foggy morning. Later in the morning I noticed a large group of seals on the beach side towards the city. I found that a bit unusual. Lots of flotsam and jetsam around due to a very high tide.
Seemed to be all sizes. One very large guy bringing up the rear. Got a real feel for how they move. They seem to have a lurching gate as they came up for air. Probably within a hundred yards of the Alki Light House at their closest point.
One thing that really impressed us was how quickly a large group of humans in SUVS formed along the roadway there! Was it on the radio? We figured that they were matriculating from the beach side.

Hey Susan,
Starting at about
1115pm tonight
I began to hear North bound blows and either pec slaps or tail lobs. My neighbors and I heard 3 groups of whales take about 20 minutes to pass by our houses here on Vashon Island (sw of Seattle). Too foggy and dark to count but a lot of whales all spread out, some close to our house some further out and I would bet 10 bucks I heard the wheezing of J8. Love these night time visits. So be on the lookout, I am sending them back to you all up North.

At

6:30 this morning
, I was out in the hot tub, (about a mile south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse,) on San Juan Island and heard tail slappings. It was too dark to see anything, but it did sound like whales. I will keep a look out for them.
