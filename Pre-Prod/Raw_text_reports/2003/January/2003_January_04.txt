Orca Sightings for January 4, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
My sister saw a pod from her place in Normandy Park (so. of Seattle, between Burien & DesMoines) on Saturday..she was amazed by a huge dorsal fin..(she didn't know male from female..let alone pod identification..sorry)..but she was sooo alive with excitement.. Checking the site often to check out the babes on my own..thanks for all the info..

While enjoying coffee at Starbucks on the beach at

9:30 am
, we spotted a large pod of orcas traveling fast. They split and one small group of 3 - 4 stayed in close while the others went out deeper - more difficult to count. I walked south around the point, following the close-in group and watching the young ones (juvenile and baby) leap into the air - everyone cheered. Lost them as I headed for home. How fun to see them without disturbing their space (i.e. no boat traffic to interfere). Happy New Year!

Last night we received a report and photos from Karen Holland on Hood Canal - she saw the orcas off Stetson Beach, just south of Ayock Pt. (N of Hoodsport & Lilliwaup) on Fri., Jan 3rd at noon; and again on Saturday around noon heading north. She also reports whales in the same area last July. She saw a group of what looks like several adult orcas and several juveniles, followed by a male.
We sent the photos to the Center for Whale Research, and Candi Emmons and Dave Ellifrit have identified the pod as a Transient pod, with the male looking like T14.
