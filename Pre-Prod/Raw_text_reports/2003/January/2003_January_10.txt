Susan,
Saw part of "L" pod about

4:10pm
North of Vashon Island, near Blake Island, going north. Looked to be about 12 total, saw at least two males and one beautiful spyhop! Later they seemed to turn in another direction. Couldn't tell for sure because I was watching from the Vashon ferry and we were heading towards Fauntleroy.

The Center for Whale Research reports that the last few times they've seen L47, her new calf L102, born in early November, has not been seen. L102 was last observed with L47 on Dec. 3rd, and did not look to be in good health at that time, so it appears the calf did not make it (though as we all know after the Springer and Luna episodes last year, that a missing calf doesn't always mean it has died....). L47's previous calf, L99, born in 2000, also was listed as missing in 2001. Let's all hope the other new calves make it through their first precarious years....

3:40pm
Approximately 10 whales with at least 1 male and 1 young male just passed through Colvos Passage heading north (east of Vashon Island). I saw one breach, and tail slapping 3 times before they disappeared from my sight.

12:40 pm:
Tom McMillen reported orcas just south of the Kingston Ferry Dock, mid-channel, heading south. (He later reported it was K pod, and followed them down to Bainbridge. At around 3 they were down near the southern tip of Bainbridge Island.)

2:25 pm
Orville White of Seabeck on Hood Canal called in a report of a pod of 5 orcas - 1 male, 2 females and two calves. They're just off the Duckabush River, mid-canal, heading south. He also saw 1 male orca at the same spot around the same time yesterday afternoon.

2:30 pm
Leigh Calvez of Bainbridge Island called to report watching a pod of orcas off Bainbridge Island, traveling south (sounds like K pod) from

1:30 -
2:30 pm. She thinks they'll be near the Seattle/Bainbridge ferry crossing at around 3ish.

3 pm
Jeff Hogan of Vashon Island called to report some L pod whales heading north in Colvos Passage (west of Vashon Island). There were ~22 whales, with 2 males ID'd as L57 and L41. They were in three groups, and at the northern tip of Vashon Island. Lots of lobtailing and porpoising.

From Zelatched Point, Dabob Bay, 4-5 Orcas headed North in Dabob Bay. First sighted at

10:45
mid range on a line of sight towards Brinnon. At

11:00
they are now nearly obscured by a fog bank off the Bolton Peninsula.
Have a good day.

10:15 am
Received a call from Candi Emmons from the Center for Whale Research, relaying a report from Ken Balcomb who spotted a pod of orcas this morning while flying from San Juan to Seattle. He saw about 12 orcas, just south of Possession Pt. (southern tip of Whidbey Island) heading south. Could be K pod heading back down south - we'll let you know what we find out - be on the lookout for orcas coming from either direction today!
