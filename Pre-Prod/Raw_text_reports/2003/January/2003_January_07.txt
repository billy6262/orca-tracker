Orca Sightings for January 7, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found the Southern Residents again off of Double Bluff (So.west Whidbey Island) at around
4 pm
, still heading south into the sunset, mid-channel. I followed them until I found the Southern Residents again off of Double Bluff (So.west Whidbey Island) at around 4 pm, still heading south into the sunset, mid-channel. I followed them until
almost 5
when it became too dark to see much. Ken Balcomb from the Center for Whale Research came down in his boat and was able to ID a few of them before the sun set: L57, L43, L95 to start with - we'll probably get more ID's from him tomorrow. They were headed past Pt. No Pt. south - so keep your eyes peeled for orcas in the Seattle area again tomorrow!
Then I got home to reports of a pod of whales in Hood Canal again - a pod of ~13 with 2 males (has to be Transients?) were in Quilcene Bay, half the pod on each side of the bay, then they left the bay and headed south further into Hood Canal
at noon
. This had been reported to Cascadia Research by the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab, and was relayed to me by Chris Dunagan of the Bremerton Sun (check their paper for his article on Weds.). Apparently some photos were taken and forwarded to the Center for Whale Research, so hopefully we'll get a positive ID on them soon.

And then we received this report of the same pod, in Dabob Bay, Hood Canal, today (Jan 7), & it sure sounds like these are Transient whales:
Hi Susan,
I was out on the water this afternoon (
2-4pm
) between Zelatched and Pulali Pt (Dabob Bay)with Kevin Long from North Olympic Salmon Coalition. We saw at least 13 orcas breaching, tail slapping and having a quite a time of it. We watched them for about an hour and they stayed in the same area and appeared to have trapped some seals next to log. Several young ones and two males. They stayed in two distict groups not more than a mile apart from one another. One male stayed at the perimeter, away from all the others.

And more on the So. Resident's as they headed south:
There is a pod of Orcas passing Point No Point as I type this (5ish?). They are just south of the Light House headed toward Eglon (Seattle). They are scattered across a half mile in small groups of 4-6. Light is getting bad so can't get photos. Have reported this to C. Dunagan at the Bremerton Sun Newspaper too.

I found the orcas just off of Lagoon Pt. at

11:20 am
, heading north, closer to the Marrowstone side of the Inlet. At ~

11:35am
they turned and started heading south, with lots of lunging, splashing, tail-lobbing and feeding-type behaviors. They kept doing this weird spy-hop-backward-half-breach that was pretty fun to watch! There were 3 groups of them, and the whales were tight together most of the time, though at noon they spread out for awhile, before grouping back up again.
There were LOTS of them - I counted a minimum of 30 whales, definitely 4 adult males, possibly 5, and I believe I saw J1 among them, so I believe it was at least J and L pods, and possibly all three pods. By noon they were closer to the Whidbey side, and came in quite close by the time they reached Bush Pt, about

1:30 pm
. At
2 pm
I also saw some porpoises just south of Bush Pt, near where the orcas were passing through - must be a lot of salmon out there! I watched them continue to head south around Bush Pt. until

2:15 pm
, then decided I needed to come home and get a report out to those of you on points south, so you can follow them and let us know where they go from here! What a beautiful day to watch whales in the sunshine~

It is

1:10
and there are at least 8 whales off Lagoon Point on SW Whidbey. They are near the the Whidbey side.

I saw your report of Bonnie's report at
11:14 (she'd seen them at

11:00
), so I took my telescope out on the deck. Spotted the blows quite a way to the north, probably close to Ft. Flagler. Way more than 6 whales.The unusual thing was that they seemed to be spread out in a single line, east to west, and swimming very shallow, blowing frequently. I had to laugh because it reminded me of one of those water shows where the vertical water spouts are timed to music. Being pretty much directly in back of them, and because they were lined up and swimming straight ahead, I could see that there were probably at least 15 whales. I could see a couple of dorsal fins, so I assume those were males. I hope you were able to see them.

2 p.m.
Tuesday. Orcas just passed by Bush Point (west Whidbey Island), headed south, fairly close to Whidbey. Two distinct groups, but not too far apart. In one group, I see two large males swimming together. Probably 15-20 altogether, though maybe more. Lots of spouting; otherwise just swimming. (Maybe the spouts are more visible than normal today because of the sunshine?)

Just received a message from Bonnie McKee at Bush Pt. (west Whidbey Island), and she reports a pod of approx. 6 orcas passing by at
11 am
, heading north - more over toward the Marrowstone Island side of the water. One male is reported.
