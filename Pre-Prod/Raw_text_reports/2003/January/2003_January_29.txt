Orca Sightings for January 29, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Some Orca are outside my house again tonight, same time as last night,

9:30
PM and they are still there at

9:40
. I can hear, as last night, two separate individuals, but I don't know if calves make noise. These don't seem as rambunctious as last night, with all the slapping sounds going on. They are very close to shore, west side of Dabob Bay, between Pulali Point and Whitney Shellfish Lab.

I found the pod of orcas reported earlier in Saratoga Passage at around

1:30 pm
, just as they were heading past Camano Island State Park, north of Elger Bay. I watched them for over an hour, as they slowly headed north, doing lots of lunging, porpoising and feeding. Several times several of the whales turned around and headed south - at one point about half of them were going south, the other half going north, all in the same area (in front of Cama Beach, just north of Camano Isl. State Pk). They were spread out, and closer to the Camano side, so it was difficult viewing and counting them (especially with them changing directions on me!) but I believe there were about 12 of them, with one Mom/calf pair, and I never saw any males, but am not sure I was seeing the whole pod. They seemed to generally continue in a northward direction - I left them at about

2:45
, a mile or so north of Cama Beach, with most of them headed in a northerly direction. It's possible they are the same pod that was on the west side of Whidbey yesterday, but I can't be sure.
