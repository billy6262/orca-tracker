Orca Sightings for January 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie, At
1655
today, I heard southern resident calls on the hydrophone. They were never loud and faded away before any fins showed up. Rich (Osborne) was hearing them at the lighthouse at the same time so we think they were probably way over in Cordova Bay near the Vancouver Island shoreline. Candi (Emmons) listened to the tape(poor timing for a walk) and said at least L's were there.

Stan Howell from the Navy base on Hood Canal called in a report today reporting the Transient orca pod once again in Dabob Bay, moving north toward the mouth of Quilcene Bay at

2:40 pm
. There were 4 or 5 orcas, and they'd been feeding for about an hour off Pulali Pt.

A group of about 10 Orcas was sighted from the BC Ferry M.V. Spirit of Vancouver Island at

14:25
headed south between Mooresby and Portland Island. One large male and one juvenile was noted. They seemed to be traveling quite fast. Unfortunately I'm unable to identify a pod.
