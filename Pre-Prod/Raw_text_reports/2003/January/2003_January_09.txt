Orca Sightings for January 9, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Number of animals seen?
5
Eastern side of Dabob Bay, slightly south of Whitney Point Shellfish Lab and slightly north of Pulali Point, in front of Lot 5, Section 18, Township 26 North, Range 1 West, Willamette Meridian
About

10:00 AM
: traveling north into Dabob Bay;
About

12:30 or
1:00 PM
: south out of Dabob Bay. Proceeding directly forward, dipping in and out of water as they traveled steadily north, then returned south. Very large individual breached first, then next sized individual, then three small, perhaps calves, sort of in between the two larger ones.
Appeared to be one larger than the rest. Ted Labbe took photographs. Marty Ereth, Jeff Davis, and Mark Rose also saw the group.

John O'Brien left a phone report of orcas between McNeil Island and Steilacoom (south of Tacoma) today (Jan 9)at
4 pm
. He said they were traveling leisurely in a SW direction - he saw one breach, one small tight group of orcas, and a lot of orcas spread out over the area. He estimated 20 - 40 orcas in all, with a half dozen adult males. This certainly sounds like L and J pods, missing from the earlier reports today; and we know at least L pod passed Whidbey going south on Tuesday, and most likely J's as well.

Susan,
We saw Lummi and we are pretty sure (but not positive) Skagit and her youngest babe. I thought I may have seen Spock in the distance as well. We followed them from West Point up to the South end of Whidbey. At the South end of Whidbey them seemed to stop and mill around a bit. I also saw a little salmon jump from the water. They seemed to be picking up the pace out Admiralty when we left at

3:30
for home, but who knows...maybe tommorow??!!!

I hurried down to the Edmonds Fishing Pier just in time to watch them go by about

2:30
. The birdwatchers were more excited about the rhinoceros auklet next to the pier, but also enjoyed watching the Orcas frolicking a little farther out in the water.

Hi Susan,
We had a call on the hotline with 5 to 7 orcas in Hood Canal in the Brinnan area (south tip of Dabob Bay, Hood Canal) heading south at

2:40
this afternoon. 1 large male and 2 young'uns with group.

We just received a report from Tom McMillen of a pod of orcas off Alki Pt, south of Seattle. They're mid-channel and appear to be heading north at a good pace at

9:50 a.m
.

11:45 am
: The leaders in the group are just north of West Pt, north of Elliott Bay, Seattle. There are LOTS of whales, very spread out.

12:50 pm
: The leading edge of the pod is at Pt. Wells, near Edmonds, north of Seattle, still heading north. They are spread out as far back as Bainbridge Island. Tom so far has only identified L pod whales, but believes there could be J's and K's as well, considering the number of whales present. Researcher Stefanie Hawks is also out with them, so hopefully between she and Tom, we'll get more confirmation on ID's before the day is over.

And this report was forwarded on by Marilyn Dahlheim of NMFS this morning:
hey marilyn ... a pod of killer whales crossing from vashon to the mainland today on the ferry at
about noon
.
