Lucky I went outside at

8:40 PM
. The Orca are relatively close to the west side of the shore of Dabob Bay. Behavior: Blowing, slapping sounds, then silence for about four minutes, then breath, silence for another two minutes, now up breathing and a little slapping again. Unless they come into the moonlight, I can't see how many--more than one by the breathing, though.

I caught up with the pod of orcas off west Whidbey just as they were headed south past Bush Pt. at

1:10 pm
. I traveled a mile or two south, and they soon came around the corner, heading further toward the middle of the channel (initially they were closer to the Whidbey side). They remained in the area, becoming quite active - lots of lob-tailing, spy-hop-twirling, lunging, changing direction, etc. There was one male in the lead that looked like J1, and though at times I thought I saw another male, I finally decided it was the same male popping up in different places. I counted approximately 15 whales in all, and one pair that looked like a mom and fairly young calf.
I watched them from that spot from

1:30 - 3 pm
, and they never moved from the same basic area, though they looked like they were traveling south most of the time (the current there is quite strong, and it was changing from flood to ebb tide, so they were swimming against the tide and appeared to be munching down on whatever fish were out there). During this time they remained closer to the other side, and stayed in the area between Foulweather Bluff and Point No Point, at the northern tip of the Kitsap Peninsula. I left for an hour, and when I returned at
4 pm
, they were still there! At one point the male took off headed south and I thought they were done fishing and headed out, but then he disappeared, only to show up again further north, but still heading south - he did this several times, and I'm SURE it was the same whale...

Susan,
Several Orca at
1445
heading south, far side toward Foul weather Bluff from Whidbey. They are in the glare of the sun so having trouble seeing them.

Susan, we have been spotting a number of porpoise in front of our home at Lagoon Point. Are they apt to be Dall's or some other porpoise. It is fun to see them but we see porpoise on a regular basis so they are not as exciting as Orca. This past week we have seen a number of porpoise only a few hundred yards off our beach but never report them as they seem to be quite common over here.

Virginia Lindsey called at
12:30 to report a pod of orcas off Bush Pt, the west side of Whidbey Island, traveling south. She said they were very active, lots of breaching.

Stan Howell called from Zalatched Pt. on Hood Canal to report hearing orca vocalizations from

6:30 - 7 am this morning, then seeing a lone male orca on the east side of Dabob Bay at
8:30 am. The orca then left Dabob Bay then headed north up Hood Canal.
