Orca Sightings for January 15, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a smaller pod, several times as they made their way south down the canal and back up. I was able to photograph them from shore at Lilliwaup about 3 PM as they were heading north again, however there was a small boat with five people in it riding along side the whales, very annoying. Isn't there a law against that? The whales seemed "hurried along" and continued to head north, except stopping once, to feed I assume, briefly, on the other side. There was one adult and several young. I packed up my gear and drove north up the canal and at Jorstead Creek observed the pod meeting up with another pod coming from the north. (Boat still in pursuit!).

We've sighted 4-5 orcas, probably one large male, in Dabob Bay off Zelatched Point this morning through mid day. They appear to have moved south specifically to get to the mouth of the Hamma Hamma River.
Have a good day.
