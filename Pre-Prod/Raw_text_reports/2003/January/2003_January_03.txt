Orca Sightings for January 3, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
only two murky shots of five (5) orca whales...looks like two adults and three calves....seen east of Potlatch State Park on highway 101 approx

3:30 PM
. I heard others saw them near Hoodsort earlier in the day..they seemed to mill around the Great Bend of Hood Canal, not quite near the Skokomish River mouth, but within tribal waters, heading north when photos taken. I was with Ryan John of WDFW with his equipment of binocs and spotting scope .. other Tribal staff shot the photos, with an Epson PhotoPC 650 digital camera.

Just received an update from Capt. Tom McMillen - it appears we have another Superpod today! He has identified whales from all three pods - all of J pod, and many whales from L and K pods, if not all of them. They traveled south past Alki Pt, were down near Pt. Robinson off SE Vashon at

2:20 pm
, and at

3:15 pm
they had made it into Commencement Bay, turned around and were heading back north. At

3:40
he said they were near Quartermaster Harbor and Neil Pt, at the very south tip of Vashon Island, and may possibly head up through Colvos Passage betweeen Vashon Island and the Kitsap Peninsula.

I first picked them up with the binocs from the Northend of the island around as they were approaching Alki at about

10:30
this morning. They (no idea exactly who but would guess that there were some from at least 2 pods) were spread out into several groups (total of 20-30 ish) and moving fast down (South) the West Seattle side. At

1:00
the first group turned in and passed Pt. Robinson less than 50 feet out with the second passing about 10 minutes later and slightly closer complete with a nice spy hop from a still peachy baby!! First group headed a off slightly Tacoma way and the second group stuck a bit more to the due West path. We walked along the beach with them for about 10-15 mintues before they turned and went further out. Last I have heard (from Tom McMillen) is that they are heading towards the Tacoma/ Vashon Ferry and his guess is that they will head up Colvos.

...could follow orcas as they rounded Alki Point about

10:25
. At that point the group was very spread out but with the helicopter hovering above and three boats nearby, it was easy to find them. We saw breaching and tail bobs as they followed the shipping lane, eventually crossing the Vashon ferry route between the Fauntleroy terminal and Vashon. Occasionally they would be swimming closer together and several times we could see 5 and 6 dorsal fins in tight formation. Although the whales were not very close, a couple breaches were visible from the shore even without binoculars! There was a general consensus that there were 'more than a dozen' in total.

There are about 16 orcas on the South side of Three Tree Point about in the South shipping lanes heading south. They are now about 1/3 of the way to Pt Robinson from the TTP light. They were very spread out - perhaps one large dorsal. On the surface quite a bit. Then a small boat came up from the Pt Robinson. They all went under except one - seemed smaller. Now they are more bunched.

Received an update on the orcas near Seattle - the latest report is that they are between Alki Pt. and the Elliott Bay Marina. Amy Carey of Vashon Island was in the city and sent this report via Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters - she said she saw a breach, and it appears the pod is heading east toward the city.

Just received a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters - who saw a large pod of orcas at

9:30 this morning
passing West Pt. (north end of Elliott Bay) and heading south. He was observing them from land, so couldn't get a good count or any ID's, but we're hoping to get more info. soon. It most likely is the pod we watched heading in near Port Townsend late yesterday - we'll let you know what we find out!
