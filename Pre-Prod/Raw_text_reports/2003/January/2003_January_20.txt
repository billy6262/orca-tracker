Finally saw them across along the east coastline of Dabob Bay moving north. We later saw them close up and identified T-14 leading group south, a group of possibly 2 females with two others (maybe juveniles) blowing alongside, then T-74 and two small females (or possibly one female and one small male with straighter fin but same size as female) with calf right behind. All travelling at steady pace south out of Dabob Bay area at around
4.00pm
.

. 3-5 Orca feeding just off John and Marilyn Pedersen's, close to location as above. Definitely feeding, as they stayed just off the cove in same area, then all went down at once, then all up at once.
Kirie, John and Marilyn Pedersen, Pulali and myriad guests
