We finally found the whales at

3:20 pm
, looking from the bluff at Admiralty Head (west-central Whidbey Island) though they were much closer to Pt. Wilson and Port Townsend than to Whidbey. It looked like they had headed past Partridge Pt. straight to Pt. Wilson, and we first saw them just NW of the buoy off Pt. Wilson. We definitely saw two groups of orcas, and I'm 90% sure I saw another small group or two trailing them. The first group had at least one large male, and the second group had a large male as well. There appeared to be at least 5-6 orcas in each group. The first group reached Pt. Wilson at

3:35pm
- from our vantage point it looked like they were REALLY close to the shore in front of the Lighthouse there! We watched them as they continued south in front of Ft. Worden State Park and the Marine Science Center, and were hoping the folks at the MSC were on the lookout so they could give us a more close-up report, and they didn't fail us! Below is another great report from the lucky folks at the PTMSC:
