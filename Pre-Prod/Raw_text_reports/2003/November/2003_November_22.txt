Orca Sightings for November 22, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:35 hours
- While working on a tugboat enroute from Seattle to Portland I came across 1 male and 3 "fims" Killer Whales (SE bound) twenty miles from Cape Flattery 480690N 1251047W.
Why did these four whales approach and swim 10 yards off the stern of this 7200 horsepower, 26 turbo charged screaming cylinders, Vessel?
