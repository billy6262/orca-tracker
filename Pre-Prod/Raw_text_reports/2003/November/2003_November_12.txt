, Cliffside, 2-3 medium very close in, quiet, possibly transients
Saturna Island

We were lucky enough to meet up with Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research at Shilshole Marina in Seattle & head up north to meet the pod just before sunset, as they were heading south past Point No Point (

3:45 pm
). Members of K pod were identified by Ken; I saw what looked like a mom & calf, and possibly a "sprouter" toward the end, but they were so spread out and light was fading it was difficult to say who all may have been out there. We left them at about

4:15pm
, very spread out and still heading south.
