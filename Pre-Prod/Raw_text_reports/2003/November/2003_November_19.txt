Orca Sightings for November 19, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about
0930
we got a call from Richard and Molly Walker who saw a group of whales head north through Cattle Pass and up into Griffin Bay. I headed out and bumped into a group of transients right in front of Friday Harbor at
1030
. There were eight whales-all females and kids. Present were T46, T47 (that's the old S1 and S2 for those of you who dont speak the T naming system), T122 (corrected), T46b, T46c, and T46d plus two new calves. The mothers of the calves appear to be T46 and T46b which makes T46 a grandma! Pretty neat that, 27 years after T46 and T47 were released from the capture in Budd Inlet in 1976, T46 is still having calves. The whales were traveling WNW up San Juan Channel and were very cooperative up until the point they ditched me and vanished about Â¾ of a mile west of Yellow Island at about
1120
. While I was with these whales, Lisa Lamb reported one male and one female kw heading west out of Spieden Channel before turning south in Haro Strait and heading for Kellett Bluff.
