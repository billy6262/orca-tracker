Orca Sightings for November 16, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whitecaps subsided, sun came out, eagles soaring and a group of orcas slowly moving north, but also seem to be fishing, just south of Pt. Partridge (west-central Whidbey Island). Difficult to tell how many, guessing ~l0, as they are a couple miles out and scattered.
