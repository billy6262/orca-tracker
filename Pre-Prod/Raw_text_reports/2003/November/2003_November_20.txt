Orca Sightings for November 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found a pair of Transient's outside Becher Bay this afternoon at
1330
heading west. I was able to ID T49 and I am guessing that the other was T50A. Between
1400
and
1430
we watched them kill a seal at Bechey Head (East Sooke Park).
