Orca Sightings for November 5, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
My mom called me to say she had seen orcas from the

10:15
Keystone-Pt. Townsend ferry yesterday (Nov. 5). She said the captain identified them as J pod and gave a lot of info about them to the passengers. She saw one of them breach, which was the first time she's seen that in the wild and she was very impressed!

We left most of L Pod in between Race Rocks and the Victoria waterfront, milling and feeding, late in the afternoon. We went to see the Humpbacks. Just as we got there we heard that Mark Mallison had found the Orcas. Off we went to see them. Missed the humpbacks, but all were very excited to see Orcas. Js and Ks might have been around, since many blows were seen in the distance.
