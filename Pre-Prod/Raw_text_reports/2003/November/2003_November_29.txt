Orca Sightings for November 29, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient's at Race Passage heading west and J Pod off of Victoria. I made a positive ID of T49 who has been around a lot this month. There were 4 other indivduals, one of which was a juvenile (a year or two old). I have seen this group with T49 twice in the last 2 weeks. I will let you know if any of my photos show who the others are.
J Pod was misplaced for a few hours after Jeff on Wildside left them at
1220
almost 3 miles south of Constance Bank on a line for Port Angeles in a resting formation. I was sidetracked with the T's but when I left them at
1430
I went on a search for J's. There were a couple of other boats also looking. Ian on Cetacean finally found them right off of Albert Head spread out doing long dives. I left them at
1650
heading east for Trial Island.
