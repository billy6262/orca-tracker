We encountered most of L-pod and some of K-pod (?) past the Kingston Ferry dock and traveled for several hours with them towards Possession. We were initially greeted by a synchronized spyhop of five whales just off port followed by multiple breaches and cartwheels. too many whales to mention, but L-41, K-40, L-57, L-84 and K-14 with new calf stood out. We also spent a lot of time with Splash (L-67), Luna's mom and Luna's new sibling.

I believe Splash's new calf has been determined to be a male - sb
