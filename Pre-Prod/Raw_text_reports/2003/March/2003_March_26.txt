Jim Maya reported whales off the County Park on San Juan Island today about
2 PM
. I spotted them by an inflatable from Canada below my shore just south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse about

2:30 PM
. Haven't seen them since, but saw three or four Canadian boats speeding across the water headed this way.

Michael Bennett of Mosquito Fleet just called (

12:40
) to report 3 Transient orcas making a kill off Fox Spit, just south of the entrance to Holmes Harbor, east Whidbey Island! He said there was one male, one female and a large calf or juvenile. They appeared to have just made a kill and were milling off Fox Spit.

Susan, my wife Laurie, was sitting on our porch at Cama Beach at

12:30am
when she heard the Gray's blow off shore, she called me out, we didn't see anything in the dark, but it sounded like they were headed north.
