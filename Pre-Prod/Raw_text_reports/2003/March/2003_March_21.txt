Orca Sightings for March 21, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Susan, we saw two adult grays in Saratoga Passage midchannel off Bell's Beach traveling south at around

11:30 this am
. One of them is almost surely a returnee we've seen in years past, (distinctive white spot behind dorsal on right side), John Calambokidis has his/her ID# and is going to be joining us for further identifications.

Hi Susan,
I just looked out the window and saw a bunch of seagulls flocking above the water. Below them was a single grey whale, flukes-in-the-air, feeding and slowly headed south toward fox spit in Saratoga Passage. Thanks for your good work!
