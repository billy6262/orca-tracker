Entry 1:
Susan,
I came across 7 transients yesterday evening at

4:00
frolicking in the kelp just outside Becher Bay. They then proceeded to steam through Race Passage putting the fear of god into the eyes of a couple of california sealions. They continued in a line and headed for Victoria as I left them at

5:15
. I made a positive id on T87.
