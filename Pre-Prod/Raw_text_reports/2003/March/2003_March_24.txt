Orca Sightings for March 24, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I completed a survey of S Whidbey/Camano area on 24 March. We spotted 5 gray whales in total, a single and a group of 4. The single was one of our regular animals (ID#49 or Patch, easily recognizable by a large depigmented area on the back right side) that was spotted off Clinton at 1117 headed south. After a search of some areas on west Whidbey, we again found this animal at 1256 south of Possession Pt. where it appeared to start feeding in about 23 m of water. At 1403 we found 4 whales just north of Possession Pt. coming down into this same area. We clearly identified whale #44 (Dubnuck), #53 and tentatively IDed #56 and either 21 or 22 (IDs to be confirmed). All these whale are regulars to this region and have been positively identified as long ago as 1991.
The sightings above seem to match the reported sightings of southbound whales in the Saratoga Passage reported early yesterday.
