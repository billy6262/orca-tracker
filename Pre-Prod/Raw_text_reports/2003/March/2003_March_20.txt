Orca Sightings for March 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bill Blandin of Camano Island (above Elger Bay) called at

8:50 am
to report observing 3 or 4 spouts of gray whales approx. 1 mile north of Langley (SE Whidbey Island). He could not determine any direction of travel at that time.

Hi Susan-
Just (

8:45 AM
) spotted at least 2 gray whales just north of Langley, on the Whidbey side of Saratoga Passage. They appeared to be feeding at the surface.
PS- Just spotted them again, down more in front of Langley, so they seem to be moving south.
