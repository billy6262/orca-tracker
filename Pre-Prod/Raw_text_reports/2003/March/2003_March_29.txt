Larry Sevick called again from his crabbing boat off of Ocean Shores, WA. At
3 pm
today he was with the pod of orcas again, they hadn't traveled north from where he saw them yesterday, but today they were closer to the shore - 1.5 miles offshore in 33' of water, whereas yesterday they were 8 miles out in 22 fathoms of water (47.01 N 124.12 W). He said they were milling, with no real direction to their travel. He saw 2 males, and at first reported 12 - 15 whales, then said he saw a bunch more on the horizon - estimating a possible total of 30 orcas. He is trying to obtain some photographs for the Center for Whale Research to look at for ID's - we'll let you know what we find out!
