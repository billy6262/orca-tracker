Orca Sightings for June 6, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
Very exciting news from our evening whale-watch yesterday (6/6 on the Mercury) - we stopped at Viti Rocks (just south of Lummi Island) to see the harbor seals - one of the passengers cried out, "Look it's a sea otter!" And just as I started into my schpeil about how we don't have sea otters in here but we do have river otters.....I looked thru the binoculars and lo and behold - it WAS a sea otter!! White whiskery face, big body, lolling about on its back in the kelp staring at us with its forepaws up in the air - I've seen a lot of sea otters in my time, in Alaska and Monterey - as well as many river otters in this area. As far as I've read, there haven't been any sightings this far inside for many years - I've heard there is a population on the outer coast of Washington and some have made their way into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
I'm so excited about this discovery - have you gotten any other reports from this area? I'd be very curious to know. Once again, nature teaches us - Never say never.....!!
Best regards,
Penny Stone

Ron Bates of the Marine Mammal Research Group in Victoria reported L pod on the west side of San Juan Island going south to False Bay in the morning, then turning north and doing the "west side shuffle" along the west side all afternoon.
Orcas were also reported at 3 pm going north around Lopez Island (J's or K's?), and on Tuesday,
June 4th, orcas were reported milling off the west side of Vancouver - maybe Offshores?

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures also reported L pod off the west side of San Juan Island.
