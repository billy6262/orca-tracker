Orca Sightings for June 7, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
6/7/02
7:30 AM Some of L Pod off the southern tip of Henry Is. feeding on the surface. By
8:00 AM they were moving south toward Lime Kiln Lighthouse. Thanks to Ross Brown.
In the past few weeks I have been seeing great numbers of small salmon working the surface of the water off the west side of San Juan Island. More than I have ever seen before at this time of the year. It's a good thing, Martha!

7:30 PM Js and Ks headed toward Stuart Is. at
6:30 PM... By the way, yesterday was the first time that the Center for Whale Research had seen the L 3s and the L54s, with L 54's new calf, first seen in Jan. and therefore a new kid for the Ls...Good news.

Howie & I spent the afternoon at the Center for Whale Research on Friday, and were treated to J & K pods doing the west side shuffle! At approx. 2 pm, K pod went north past the Center, then turned around & headed back south. At 4 pm J & K pods both were headed north past the Center. No further reports on L's travels....
