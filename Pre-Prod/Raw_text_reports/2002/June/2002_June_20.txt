Orca Sightings for June 20, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan ...
We met up with T14 at approximately 0700 this evening just south of D'Arcy. How big and beautiful he is!!! He was mulling southbound, taking his time with deep dives for approximately 10-15 minutes. He gradually kept moving south and then in towards shore. It was a beautiful evening and wonderful to see him. J's and K's were reported up in Samson ... but we didn't get up that far. No reports that we are aware of on the L's.
Cheers,
Mo - Orca Quest
