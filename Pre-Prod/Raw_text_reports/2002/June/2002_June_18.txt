Orca Sightings for June 18, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and all the rest of you.
A really odd day for my part of the world. Picked up Lpod going N. this morning off the Southern part of San Juan Is.
Next came reports of Kpod ahead of the L's and later reports of J's ahead of the K's. Had a great encounter with L's , did not see any K's myself.
Had a great encounter with L73 and Dall's Porpoise all over him. In the afternoon Lpod turned South and came through Hughes Pass and along the Van. Is. shore and on into Oak Bay and then on across the Vic.. waterfront, they should be at Race Rocks outbound as I write this. To the best of my knowledge J's and K's have carried on North.
