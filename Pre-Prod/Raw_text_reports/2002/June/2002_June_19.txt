Odd day from my world no J's or L" had Kpod all day, they came out of Rosario St. in the am up past Lopez to San Juan Is in the afternoon. Still at Salmon bank in the evening, having gone up island and back down.
K21 being very much a independent young man off shore from all the rest.

Hi Susan ...
At 1942 we met up with J pod just north of Lime Kiln; whales were heading south and spread out but moving along at a good pace. Appears that J1 has picked up a bit of a wheez and we definitely recognized J8!!! There were a few tail slaps along the way but for the most part they were "cruising." Also had Dall's porpoises surfing the bow, a wonderful encounter with a harbor seal doing some tail slapping and feeding and finished the evening with a beautiful bald eagle swooping down for fish.
Cheers,
Mo - Orca Quest
