Hi
Whales all over. 10 or so Lpod going west from Race Rocks this morning. J's and K's off Lopez at the same time with Kpod near Kellet Bluff. In the afternoon was with J's and L's both sides of Lime kiln. The small group of L's still going west, no reports of K's At 1930 whales in Swanson Ch. going towards Active Pass only one male reported sounds like Jpod no report on L's. Can you loan me a sea otter? 6 El. seals at Race Rocks this morning.
