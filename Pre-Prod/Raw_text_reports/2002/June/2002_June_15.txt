Orca Sightings for June 15, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
At 7 P.M. Sat. evening (
June 15) seven whales churned the water directly below Oak Bluffs on N. Pender Island, B.C., for about 20 minutes. They seemed to be feeding. Every whale behaviour was put on display. When they left, 2 other groups of 5 whales each went by in the same direction (N.W.)

Hi
Well the morning was most interesting, whales coming down from Turn Pt.
Whales going N.W. up the west side and whales in Rosario off Deception Pass.
This was all at the same time.
It turned out to be J's and some K's coming south from Turn Pt. a number of Lpod going towards the park from the South and the rest of the K's in Rosario.
In the afternoon they had all met and were going towards Turn Pt. I never saw any L12 whales maybe someone can help me out with a report? This afternoons encounter was simply magical.

Hi Howard and Susan!
Spent the day in the midst of a wonderful superpod off of American Camp. We followed K pod as they met up with J's and L's coming south. It was a fabulous afternoon. All of the whale watch boats were "dead stop" in the water and the few private boaters were obviously savvy as they did the same.
The whales just were totally into each other and the best part we were fortunate enough to see was young Cappuccino trying very hard to romance a female into accepting his advances. There is no telling if she finally did, but we saw lots of Cappuccino that we don't usually see....twice we saw her roll onto her back and lift her ventral side into the air...I suppose to avoid his more amorous advances. Poor guy, I guess he is not old enough yet, or maybe he was....Jeremy got some good video and hopefully we will be able to ID the female.
