Orca Sightings for January 10, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
First, from Marilyn Dahlheim of NMFS:
Hi all. Talked to my husband Bob today and Foster was seen yesterday (Jan. 9th) - still in Commencement Bay (via Crowley Tug crew).

And thanks to a partnership with the Washington State Ferries, these two calls of a Gray whale off Edmonds just came in:
First, Dale from the ferry Spokane called in with a report of a small gray whale at
1:30 pm in the Pt. Wells & Edmonds Ferry dock area. Then a call came in from the Edmonds Ferry Dock of the same gray whale at
1:30, circling just south of the ferry dock about 100 yds. off shore.
*
We got a call at
1:30 a.m. this morning from the Arthur Foss Tug, which was at the Oil Dock at Pt. Wells, south of Edmonds. They reported a young orca (8-9' in length) swimming back & forth right next to the ship they were getting ready to escort out. They said the orca was moving slowly, & staying near the surface, & had been there about 45 minutes. The description & behavior sounded very much like the reports of the whale in Swinomish Channel, & again, the guys on the Foss Tug reported it had a white belly & were very sure it was an orca. We have reported this to NMFS, & checked again with the crew of the Foss, but their last report was at 2 am when they pulled away from the dock & the whale was still there.
Tuesday,
