Orca Sightings for January 3, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan - I have a second-hand report of 6-8 orcas passing by the Lummi Island ferry Thursday about 10 a.m. (Hale Passage) - the ferry stopped and watched them for a while. That's all I've got for info now, if I get some more interesting facts I'll let you know (like who they were??) - other than that, haven't seen or heard of any whales in Lummi vicinity for months!

P.S. Hurray for Mr. T(ransient)!!

First is a report of a lone orca in Swinomish Channel, called in by Jack Sanford. Yesterday at dusk he saw what he is 90% sure was a small orca swimming in the channel. Subsequent callers reported seeing a small orca in Swinomish Channel Wednesday, Jan 2 and Thursday Jan 3.
Note:
We have also received several additional reports of a small "mystery" orca in Swinomish Channel near LaConner yesterday afternoon, so we are asking anyone in that general area to please look for this animal & call us if you see it. There is some concern that it could possibly be connected to the strandings in Dungeness Bay, & in any case, it is very strange behavior for an orca to be in the channel for several days like this. On Friday Shane Agergaard of Island Adventures in Anacortes searched around Fidalgo Island and down Swinomish Channel to Hole-in-the-Wall but did not find the orca.
*
Then, a call from Tom McMillen, who had another report of orcas off south Bainbridge Island from Chris Sly at
3:30 this afternoon. The pod was headed toward West Pt. (just north of Elliott Bay).
*
And lastly, an update on the strandings in Dungeness Bay. The orcas are now officially identified as being transients, the male orca is still inside the bay, in spite of repeated efforts to tow him out to deeper water. He keeps getting out of the towing harness & heading back in toward the beach where he was stranded.......watch KING 5 & KIRO 7 news for more details, & we'll keep you posted as we hear more.
Wednesday,
