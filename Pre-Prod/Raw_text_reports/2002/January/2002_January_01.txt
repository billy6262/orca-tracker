Orca Sightings for January 1, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here's the first sighting of 2002! Got a call via hotline from a lady down in Carr Inlet (west of Gig Harbor) - approx. 12 whales (1 bull) rummaging around down there between
8:30 and
11:30 this morning. Going N, then going S, then they stopped and looked to be feeding. . . maybe it's the long-lost Js??
