Orca Sightings for January 11, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called & said he was with a pseudorca he believes to be "Foster" at Pt. Wells today (Jan. 11th) from 1 - 2 pm. Here's the report from www.Orcacam.com - check back with their site later for photos or video from Tom:
Good News! This afternoon Captain Tom McMillen located and identified the source of the recent reports. First contact was near Point Wells - it is tentatively identified as a pseudorca (pseudorca crassidens) or false killer whale, approximately 14 feet in length. It appeared to be actively feeding in the tide lines. When Tom left it near the Edmonds Fery Dock at about
2:00pm, it was heading slowly north. During the time that Tom observed the pseudorca, it approached quite close to the boat and he was able to get some good video so we should have photos online tomorrow.

Also, Marilyn Dahlheim of NMFS just sent in the following summary of "Foster" sightings from Crowley Tug crews:
Hi Susan & Howie.
Foster update (via Crowley Tug). Foster was in the Seattle area (Pier 17 region) last weekend swimming amongst various ships/tugs. The Crowley Tug "Guide" began transiting south from Seattle to Tacoma on Monday morning (7th Jan). Foster swam right along side the tug boat most of the way to Tacoma. The crew lost sight of him in the muddy waters near Commencement Bay. They did see him on Wednesday (9th) but they haven't seen him the last couple of days. Maybe he is up at Pt. Wells.
Best regards.
Marilyn
Thursday,
