Orca Sightings for January 6, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan:
We have two sightings of orcas from this morning (Sunday the 6th). Both reports suggested 10+ whales with two bulls between 0900 and 1000 going south, east of Vashon Island.

Just received a call from Brenda Peterson on Alki Pt. near Seattle - she saw a pod of orcas headed south toward Three Tree Pt (south of Seattle) at
2:50 pm. She could see 1 male + at least two others, but visibility was poor with the mist.
Friday,
