Orca Sightings for January 18, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received an update from Tom McMillen about J pod & the lone orca calf. It sounds like J pod got within 1 or 2 miles of the calf this afternoon down near Vashon Island, but then turned around and headed back north for awhile, going up near Blake Island & Bremerton, & then turning south again toward Vashon Island as it got dark. Tom was with J pod, & Mark Sears was with the calf, & he reported that the calf got very excited when J pod got close, & it began vocalizing a lot.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called with a report of J pod near Alki at
1:10 this afternoon (Jan. 18). They were heading across Elliott Bay and were approximately 2 miles from the Fauntleroy Ferry Dock. Apparently the lone young orca calf is still in this area, so it could be interesting to see what kind of interactions take place if it meets up with J pod! We'll keep you informed soon as we hear more!
