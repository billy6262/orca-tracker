Orca Sightings for October 31, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was just barely getting my eyes peeled at around
7 this morning
, watching the rising sun reflect off windows on Marrowstone Island, when I saw orcas! A small group was swimming south, close to shore, and were just south of Bush Point (west Whidbey Island). I counted only about 5 or 6 whales and saw no adult males. By the time I got them spotted in my telescope, they were passing out of sight. They were simply making their way south--no special effects.

I met up with a purse seine boat off Kingston this morning. As I arrived about

10:20 a.m
., the fishermen there told me that a large group of orcas had just passed by, heading south. I'm anxious for more reports from the Kitsap Peninsula. chris.

Lori Robinson of Seattle called in to say she'd watched the orcas as they headed north going past Edmonds. She thought it looked like some of J's and some of L's, possibly with the new little one! She said it looked like they were staying close to the east side as they neared Whidbey, so maybe they'll come up Saratoga Passage? It sounds like those on the Edmonds/Kingston ferry today got a good look at them, too!

1:25 pm
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called and said a Seattle TV station had called him to report that they'd received calls of orcas heading north past Edmonds - so maybe we'll get to see them on the news tonight!

(
approx. 3 PM
) Our office manager, Sue Johnson, reported seeing a pod of Orca's going north past the Edmonds ferry dock earlier today. She's not sure how many, but she thinks it might have been as many as 15 individuals, including one large male.

I was able to catch up with the orcas around 1p.m. today at the Edmonds fishing pier. There were roughly 25-30 whales about a mile and a half off shore, heading north. Apparently they had made it a bit farther south in the morning before they turned around and headed back north. Pretty sure I saw J1 and L57, and a very wee one who I'm convinced was L101 (that's my story and I'm sticking to it! ). The kids were playing together, there were a bunch of breaches just as the Edmonds/Kingston ferry came through with most of the passengers hanging off the back of the ferry watching. The killer whales grouped up past the ferry dock and continued heading north. The last I saw them, about

1:40p.m.
, they were travelling abreast heading toward the west side of Whidbey, up through Saratoga Passage.

Hi ... Hey, as my ferry was approaching the Edmonds dock, the mate announced that there was a pod of orcas just off the dock! I've seen orcas many times, but never from the ferry. Not only that, but this pod (I think it was L-Pod) was incredibly active. They were breaching, spy-hopping, tail slapping, and even doing head stands! What a nice accent to a beautiful Autumn day.
Take care,

Just got a call from my wife, from the ferry headed toward Clinton. They saw several whales headed north toward Saratoga Passage. This was about

4:10 PM

It’s our first sighting!! How exciting, splendid and magnificent. We watched approximately 15 orcas between

4:00 pm and
4:15pm
heading north from our view ½ mile south of the Clinton ferry dock. It was obvious the passengers on the ferry saw them too.

A number of whales were between Langley and Camano Head at

10:00 p.m.
on Halloween. The whales seemed to be moving very slowly toward Hat Island and Everett.
