Orca Sightings for October 23, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
No Orcas spotted, but we did see a large Minke in north Haro St., not far from where the transient Orcas took a Minke a few days ago, along with many Dall's Porpoise that ran with us for a long time. There were scores of deer and sheep on the south side of Speiden Is. and lots of Steller Sea Lions showing up, especially near and on Whale Rock, Cattle Pass. Also a huge number of Loons have shown recently, mostly Pacific Loons, along with many wintering migratory water fowl.
