Orca Sightings for October 19, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters, passing on a report from the Center for Whale Research (west side of San Juan Island). All of
J and K pods
passed by going north
at
1:30
today. Dave Ellifrit said they were grouped up and in tight to the shore, so he got a good look at them and they were all accounted for.
*
J's and K's at Turn Pt. both ended up going into Swanson Ch. in the afternoon.

...J and K pods in Haro Strait
about 1 pm
north of the County Park. They traveled north past Battleship Island, turned around several times as if undecided which way to proceed. When we left them, one pod was heading up Swanson Channel and the other up Boundary Pass.
