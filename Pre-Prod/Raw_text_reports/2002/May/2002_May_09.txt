Orca Sightings for May 9, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
The OVAL hydrophone array recorded spectacular vocalizations and echolocation clicks this morning around
7:30 am as J pod passed southbound in Haro Strait about 250 m offshore of Smugglers Cove, San Juan Island. The sea was quiet and no boats were present so the sounds were ethereal!

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reports one Transient in Baynes Channel this morning, and parts of J pod this afternoon. At 2 pm they were near Iceburg Pt, and moved northwest up to the west side of San Juan Island, turning around and heading south at Pile Pt.

Hi Susan! I'm sure that there will be other J Pod reports today, however, this is the first time that we found them without the help of my whale watching friends! We were on our boat on the south side of Lopez and accidentally floated upon five or six of them feeding and putting on quite a show, at around
1:30p.m. As our friends from Island Adventures led us toward Iceberg Point, there were at least seven whales with us, but I'm still an amateur at identifying! I did see J17 and her daughters. We stayed with them until about
3:15 and left for Friday Harbor as they moved past Cattle Point. It was an amazing day for us newcomers! ~Meredith, Travis & Sean Link
