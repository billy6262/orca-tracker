3 pm - We received a call of 4 - 5 orcas in Penn Cove, off Coupeville, Whidbey Island. The caller saw 3 big fins, then saw two others spouting. She said they were in the middle of the cove traveling south - we're headed to Seattle for tonight's Snake River Salmon presentation, but hope to get a chance to look out on the water before we leave & see if we see any fins....

Left Jpod going N. in Andrews Bay (San Juan Island) at 1545. The Stellar may be a female, as usual must wait for photos but had one there 2 years ago.
