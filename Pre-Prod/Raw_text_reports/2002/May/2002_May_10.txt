Entry 1:
Hi
A very odd day, was in Spieden Ch. when info came in about transients east of Race Rocks. Before this at 1052 had the greatest number of Dall's posrpoise in 15+ years of observation's just E. of Kelp Reef, I mean 500+. We ran to an area S. of Victoria and found T10,T10A and the third whale which I think was named at T10B at 1304. We went S.E. in the afternoon to T14 who was 13miles S.E. of Victoria found him at 1510hrs. After that on to Race Rocks were I found 15+ El Seals all female or juveniles.

Hi Susan and Howie,
We had transients heading north in Andrews Bay this afternoon (west side of San Juan Island). At about 1620 they passed right by the reef. Present were T10, T10b, T10c(?), T18, T19, T19b, and T19c(?). I'll have to check with Graeme about the "c"'s to make sure one of them is not a "d". Ken and I had an encounter with them in the whaler as they traveled and milled deep into Mitchell Bay, past the mouth of Open Bay, and along the rocks at Kellett Bluff. We left them travelling northwest about 1/2 mile west of north Kellett Bluff around 1730. We heard that these whales had been at Race Rocks earlier in the day and T14 had been seen too.

Hi- Just enjoyed 2 gray whales feeding vigorously, close together, just south of Mabana (4 pm). Lots of laying on their sides with fluke and tail fin vertical in the air. One looked smaller, so may have been Mom and baby. Also thought I heard them last evening but couldn't find them, but this morning with the tide out, there were fresh feeding holes on the tide flats.
