Orca Sightings for May 28, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi
With Lpod only today J and K went North. In the morning they were around Eagle Pt. to False Bay hardly moving at all.
The afternoon they had their faces into a flood tide and were off Seabird Pt. (Discovery Is.) all afternoon. I thought I had them all but Dave from the Center told me that L5 subpod had gone N. and later I heard the L5's had turned and were coming back South. No info after about 1730 L's still near Discovery and J and K up North

8:00 PM. There was a Gray spotted off Eagle Cove midday.
