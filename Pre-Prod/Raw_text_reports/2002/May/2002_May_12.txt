Hi
At least 4 Minke's on Hein bank this morning 1145hrs. Jpod going N. again, I was with them at 1501hrs at Kellet Bluff. The mass of Dall's has now moved N. to Turn Pt. If true to form they will go N.E. in Boundary Pass. As a matter of interest Hein Bank has "come alive" bait balls, minke's and birds.
