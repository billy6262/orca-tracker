Orca Sightings for May 5, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi, We saw 3 or 4 grey whales about a hundred yards out from the Clinton ferry dock this morning (
May 5) at
8:30. They were headed South. Two of them spouted almost simultaneously and very close together making us wonder if it wasn't a mother and her calf.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reported a pod of orcas in Obstruction Pass (off Orcas Island) Sunday at 1pm, headed south.
*
Chuck Poust called from the Windjammer Gallery in Coupeville to report one gray whale headed into Penn Cove at
8:30 am.
*
A single transient (T61?) reported off Cowichan Head at 1200 and T14 of Cadboro Pt. (the N.E. corner of Baynes Ch, southeast Vancouver Island) at 1220. The times and distance would indicate 2 whales.
