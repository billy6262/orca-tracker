Orca Sightings for September 12, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sept. 12 in Haro St. just after 1000 no reports of offshores but J's, most of the K's and some L's in Swanson Ch. going N. at 0915. Met some L's and K's at 1130 off Wallace Pt. (bottom of N.Pender Is.) going S. A radio report says the offshores are in Saanich Inlet. Had to switch boats to get a vessel going to Saanich Inlet. At 1600 at 48 32 .808 123 32 .518 I am in the midst of 50+ whales in a inlet at this point only a 1/2 mile wide, no idea what they are finding to eat or what they are doing.

A researcher friend and I ran over to Mill Bay past Saanich Peninsula and spotted 6 offshores headed north. Then we continued south into Finlayson Arm to see approx 50 more of the Offshores. This day the orca seemed aggitated and often changed direction making large circles several times during the time we were there.
