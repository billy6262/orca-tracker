Orca Sightings for September 11, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Marilyn Arbruster of Baby Island Heights, Whidbey Island, reporting a pod of orcas at
6:30 pm Sept. 11th, heading south past Baby Island.

7pm ish on Sept 11, many Orcas slowly traveling toward Langley in Saratoga Passage. Those of us on Bell's Beach, on NE side of Whidbey watched from the bluff as maybe 12, slapped their tales and spy hopped and a few breaches! Mostly seemed to be feeding. Neighbors who've been here many years say they haven't seen this many since the '70's... What a wondrous heart lifting sight of our beautiful corner of the world on the day of solemn remembrance.

Wonderful day today (9-11) out on the water. We watched at least 30-40 different whales today out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca between
13:00 and
15:00. They weren't the residents- and weren't part of any Transient group I have ever seen. Around 50-100 whales in the area? There were a few breaches and lunges in the groups...also a few spyhops and some speed swimming. These offshores do it all... :) :) :)

Hi
Whales reported south of Victoria going E. at about 0900 4 miles E. of Race Rocks. 1048 on scene with many whales, boats are not sure as yet who we have but the more experienced are saying not residents. I have a group go by with more calves then have been born in the Southern Res.. and Northern Res. combined in the last year, these must be offshores. Have about 60-70 whales in my immediate area with blows and splashes up to 2 miles S. no one even checked as we had so many whales. No huge males seen i.e. J1 but males and the females with calves were "just smaller." The whales showed no interest in the boats, just swam on by as if they were not there at all, the vocalization was in fact alien to me, but a lot of it. Back in and out second contact at 1521 of the west side of San Juan Is. The whales seem a bit confused as to which way to go but after about 20 mins. they decide to go N. A few boats report that some are taking salmon, did not see this myself.
All day no reports of our resident whales or transients. (
see our earlier reports of probable residents in Saratoga Passage - sb
)
So at dark these whales are reported going N. from Kelp Reef.

A pod of orcas reported from the Clinton Ferry, heading north

10:30 am
Good morning...this sad day of remembrance began with a wondrous sight of 20+ Orcas in the Saratoga Passage. They traveled at a steady rate, diving once for a few minutes, at
10:30 AM. Initially there were between 10-12 with one male visible and then about 100 yards behind and closing in were another 12-15 Orcas with what appeared to be 2 males and they grouped and moved on north. They were about 300 yards off shore. We watched them for 15 minutes as they faded into the fog and mist. We hope everyone has a peaceful 9-11.

Susan--
My friend Dave Swenson was in Langley an hour or so ago (
10:30 or
11:30). He called to tell me that he'd seen at least 7 orcas heading north in Saratoga Passage just off Langley. He was not able to ID them.

11:50 am
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called in a report saying there are LOTs of whales out there
(we thought he meant the ones around Whidbey, but NOOOO!)
. L pod was reported inbound from Race Rocks; J's and K's were west of Hein Bank; and 100 other orcas were east bound between Discovery Island and Pilot buoy, and along the Victoria waterfront.
No ID's yet - obviously not Southern Residents - are they Offshores? Northern Residents? (maybe Springer is bringing her family down to visit?!) And then who are the Whidbey Whales??!!!

2 pm HI Susan,
Wed
September 11 was a significant day on the water as we watched the offshore whales travel slowly headed east from Hein Bank. The treat of the day was having our hydrophone carry calls over the boats speakers which we had never heard before. Hope someone got those calls recorded. This activity was in sharp contrast to the first time we saw them several years ago.
That time was south of Victoria, the first offshore sightings we had heard about in the islands. There was about a 2' chop and the offshores seemed to travel in a nervous zig zag fashion, most of the time traveling away from any boats in the area. Our photos weren't good since they did not allow us to get close enough for detailed pictures.
These whales did not seem to be the same ones, but hopefully some id photos will tell us that. We had Sally and Leslie from The Museum onboard to observe this special sighting.

5:05 pm
Kay Wylie of Hidden Beach, Greenbank, called to report a huge pod of 14-15 orcas in Saratoga Passage, mid-channel, circling. A coast guard copter was flying above them (hope they got photos!)
*

5:25 pm
John Delano of Greenbank called in a report of orcas in Saratoga Passage swimming south past Camano Island State Park, he'd been watching them pass by for approximately a half hour.
*

5:32 pm
Neighbor Karen Gervais of Greenbank called in a report of approximately 10 orcas breaching, playing, very active - a spectacular sight! Now we know the orcas were in our back yard, and we missed them!
*

5:45 pm
Hi Susan... Karen says she tried to call you and Howie to let you know there was a pod of Orca's in our backyard. If you get back in time, you might see them on their return trip. They were headed into Holmes Harbor around
5:45... Sorry I don't recognize the pod's yet, but there were 10 or 12 of them.

6:23 pm
Karen Gervais called back to report the orcas headed into Holmes Harbor at 6ish - sorry we missed them!

6:30 pm
Nancy Nolan looked up from teaching a voice student to see 15 - 20 orcas from her home on Saratoga Passage, off Baby Island (south of the entrance to Holmes Harbor) and heading south toward Langley, in the center of the passage.
*

7:30 p.m.
A huge pod of Orcas just passed our house (3 miles north of Langley) in Saratoga Passage, headed (south) toward Langley. We estimate 20 or so, moving steadily but somewhat slowly for Orcas. Very exciting! I've never seen such a huge pod in the 12 years I've lived here.

Dear Susan and Howie,
I got a call from Jeff Weeks tonight at about 8 pm saying Fran Abel had just told him 20 or so Orcas were heading down toward Langley. I ran to a viewing spot and saw them going by, then my husband and I hopped on bikes and went down to Langley Marina, where we could hear them really well. They were a bit further toward Sandy Point. We spoke to a couple of men at the marina who said there were actually 30-40 Orcas. The men had spent 3 hours earlier in the day with them in Holmes Harbor. They said that there was no one else around all that time.
