Orca Sightings for September 10, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Early reports of whales going E. from Race Rocks. Not out until 1000 but nothing unusual reported, in fact a minke just south of Discovery Is. at 1035.
1108 made contact J's K's and L's a bit west of Hein Bank. All the whales in a resting mode. J's and K's slowly broke from the L's and started back to Victoria.
At 1224 they were south of Discovery Is. and awake and going W.
Between 1230 and 1245, 6 Transients the T20, T21, and others from a few days ago appear in the area. The residents seem oblivious to this and in fact the T's swam under the Res... but my observer says 6 T's dove and 9 surfaced?
The J's and K's minus the K3's carry on to the west followed by the transients, about a 1/3 0f a mile behind. At 1450 I again am coming on scene when the Res... go "Ballistic." This is odd as the Trans are now about 1/2 mile to the S.W. going to Race. The J's and K's now appear to be "amok" running insanely but always rolling onto and into themselves. There is no direction of travel, in fact it is like calling a square dance, but in over 20 mins. they never dove nor vocalized.
They started to calm down just after I left to go to Race Rocks where I met T141, T141A and T144; my other driver with the T20 group never saw these whales and I never saw his, but a boat ahead of us reported 3 females going W.
So I have no idea how many Transients "popped" in to the area but for about 1/2 hour. They seemed to have totally spooked the Res..

Hi Howard and Susan, I saw a whale in Port Townsend Bay today... 9/10 while I was visiting Chetzamoka Park around
3:00. Did anyone else see this? The whale was heading for Fort Worden and presumably out towards the Strait. I only saw 3 blows and it was moving so swiftly I thought of Minke, but the blow was rather larger than that of Minke's as I have seen then before... Humpback?...no fin so not Orca. I was working at the time and could not get my binoculars. My first sighting! I am going to San Juan island this Sun and Monday for wildlife and whale watching. Best,

This could easily be the humpback that has been sighted recently around the San Juan Islands- let's keep our eyes peeled and see if there are any other sightings of it in the Strait! -sb
