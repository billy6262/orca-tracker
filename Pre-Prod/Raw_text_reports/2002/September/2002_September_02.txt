Orca Sightings for September 2, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan. So just as I'm plugging away at the computer here at the Lighthouse, the sun comes out and I hear whales on the hydrophone. They headed North in tight family groups spread out medium travel around 1745. There were lots of whales and I definitely heard L and J pod calls. This was a wonderful way to wrap up a great 3 day weekend for me. Happy Labor Day!

Hi
L12's going towards Rosario St. this am in the mist and rain. J's K's and other Lpod whales going S. in Rosario St. I made contact at 1540 between Salmon bank and Iceberg Pt. I saw J's K's and Lpod whales including the L12's so I would say the were all there. At this time they were going up Haro St.
