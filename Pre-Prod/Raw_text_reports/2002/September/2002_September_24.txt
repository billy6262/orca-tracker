Orca Sightings for September 24, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
1430 - 1700 hrs - another amazing day not only with the residents but - surprise surprise - the offshores too (my first time seeing them!) Some interesting notes - when we saw the offshores, they were approx. 1-2 miles from the residents traveling away from them in a SW direction in mid-Haro Strait (off Henry I.) [a huge container ship came barreling thru at top speed during this time right in the whales' and boats' area] - when we returned to the residents (J,K,Ls) , they were engaging in some interesting behavior - at Danger Shoal, swimming back and forth rapidly in what one might call an "agitated" manner, constantly changing directions, but staying in a relatively tight group. There was quite a bit of "humpbacking," i.e. when they come high up out of the water as for a deeper dive (but did not dive deep, stayed up at surface) - hardly any vocalization, very quiet. As we stayed in the area a while, they seemed to "calm down" a bit, swimming slower and more "relaxed", but stayed in the same area, apparently for about two hours. Capt. Mark said he'd never seen behavior quite like that and wondered if it perhaps was a response to the offshores in the area....?? Verrrry interesting...!!

This description sounds exactly like the behavior exhibited by the So. Residents when the Transients were around them on Sept. 10 - from Ron Bates - sb

We had offshores again yesterday (24 Sept) [in Haro St.]. They were the same ones we had in Saanich Inlet and Cowichan Bay earlier in the month. Will ID all the pics and send a summary later.
