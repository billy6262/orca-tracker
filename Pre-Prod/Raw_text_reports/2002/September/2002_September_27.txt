Orca Sightings for September 27, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients T 46's in the course of the day they killed 2 H. porpoise, 2 Harbor Seals and I have never seen 5 transients attack so many birds, most were Common Murres, if not all. I mean dozens, not sure how many they ate but attacks all day. This all happened from Discovery Is. to Race Rocks from 1031 to 1500.
Some Dall's and 3 minkes for good luck.

Elizabeth Ross of Olympia just called in an unidentified large whale, mid-way in Eld Inlet, Olympia, at
7:30 pm tonight, Sept. 27. She was too far away to tell what kind of whale it was, but it did two breaches, about 10 minutes apart.
