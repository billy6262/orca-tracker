Hi Susan
We were with J pod this afternoon, 25 February, off Nanaimo. They headed south down Northumberland Channel and through Dodd Narrows. They were still heading south when we left them off Yellow Point at 1600 h.

Cascadia Research reports:
We received one of our first gray whale sighting reports for the season in Puget Sound today. G.A. Lincicum reported seeing a blow and a gray back with no dorsal fin at 0945 this Monday morning off Point No Point in northern Puget Sound. Typically, we get our first sightings of the regular northern Puget Sound returning animals in late February or early March of each year, so this appears to be on schedule.
