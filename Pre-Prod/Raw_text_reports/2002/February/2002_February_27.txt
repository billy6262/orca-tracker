============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi,
I have report of a sighting from Wednesday 27 February. Sorry for the delay. The location was approximately
49:22:26.1N/1
24:02:08.3W (near Nanaimo, BC)
The report is as follows: probably One female and about 4 calves first sighted about 0800 heading north. Two hours later the Orcas returned to the area and then moved off to the north. One large male was seen in the vicinity. About 1300, the Orcas returned to the area for 40 minutes until the Orcas departed to the East.
