We just received a call from Rosalie Melnick of Hartstene Island north of Olympia. She watched a pod of orcas off the north tip of Hartstene Island at
9 am
, feeding close to shore. She saw one group of three, and another small group - probably 5 or 6 total. They headed into Pickering Passage (between Hartstene and the mainland), and she lost them in the fog. This is way up in Case Inlet, way down in south Puget Sound - must be the same orcas reported on Saturday.
