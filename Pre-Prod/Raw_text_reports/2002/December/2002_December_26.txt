Orca Sightings for December 26, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just received a phone message from Bonnie at Bush Pt. Bed & Breakfast (west Whidbey Island), who had just heard from a friend that a pod of ~6 orcas passed by Bush Pt. at around
1 or
1:15 pm
today. There was a male leading the pod, and it appeared they were headed south.....

Just found another message waiting for me on our cell phone - from Elsa Leavitt of Bush Pt, who reports the pod of ~6 orcas with one male
at
1:15 pm
headed NORTH from Bush Pt.

I found the whales at

2:15 pm
, between Lake Hancock (west Whidbey Island) and Ft. Flagler across the Inlet. I watched them for about 45 minutes - at times some of them would turn and head south, while others continued to travel north, but over the time period I watched them their main direction was northward. They were VERY spread out, except for one tight group of 5 whales. I counted at the very least 10 whales, but more likely there were probably 12 - 15 total. I saw one adult male for sure, and at one time thought I spotted another but they were too far out to be sure. I caught one view with the sun hitting the definite male fin, and it appeared to be ruffled like J1's. I also saw what looked like at least one Mom/calf pair.They were quite active, lots of tail-lobbing and lunging going on, so my guess is they were feeding on salmon. I followed them a little further north, and at

3:15 pm
they were between Pt. Wilson and Admiralty Head, and seemed to be closer to the Whidbey side as they continued in a north-west direction, possibly heading up to the San Juans. What a great holiday treat - Santa brought me everything I wanted - new binoculars, and some whales to watch through them!

Susan, we just spotted a pod of Orca passing Lagoon Point heading north. (

2:00 PM
) 6-8 females and at least 2 males. Too far out to seen any edifying markings.

Hi Susan,

9:30 this morning
. No direction mentioned.

Hi Susan, At
around
11:30 a.m.
today we spotted 8+ orcas travelling slowly south at South Beach several hundred yards off shore. L57 was clearly identifiable, plus another large bull, a large sprouter (maybe L79), another sprouter, at least two juveniles, and at least two females or immature males. At Cattle Point the orcas began milling. They continued to mill for about 10 minutes. Next they turned into San Juan Channel close in and swam single file into the fairly strong currents for another several minutes. Then they disappeared for several minutes. It seems that this was the beginning of a lengthy cooperative feeding frenzy, as next the water began swirling into waves that grew in size for a number of seconds, similar to those that would be generated by a huge jacuzzi pump. Within several more seconds the whales erupted on the surface and began high porpoising, slamming and thrashing their tails, and splashing and spraying with their pecs, as they dove in every direction. At the same time the seagulls began to congregate, apparently for the bits and pieces. Most of the action was at the surface, so it was quite spectacular to watch. We left the orcas at
around
2:00 p.m
. as they continued this apparent feeding behavior. At that time they were heading in a south westerly direction several miles off shore, with their spraying and splashing still clearly visible from land. I had never before seen the whales engage in such active feeding for so long a period. We also saw many seals, one sea lion and four soaring eagles at Cattle Point. Quite a good day!

Hi Susan, We received a report of a different perspective on the
December 26th whale sighting in Cattle Pass. That sighting reported L-pod fishing in
between
11:30 and
2:00
.
We have a report from a pilot in the same area at the same time and he saw 6 orcas batting around a brown seal with lots of orca activity and seagulls swooping in for bits. From the descriptions of the activity these I think these orcas were definitely hunting and eating a marine mammal.
