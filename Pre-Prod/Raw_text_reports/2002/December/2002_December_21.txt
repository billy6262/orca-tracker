Joe Croft called with a report of 2 male orcas swimming off Carlyon Beach (northern tip of the peninsula between Eld Inlet and Totten Inlet, near Olympia) in Squaxin passage, between the mainland and Hope Island. They were swimming fast and heading north. He didn't have binoculars, but said they were 1/4 to 1/3 mile out from his house, so he got a pretty good look.

Three male orcas were sighted cruising the entrance to Eld Inlet this morning (

8:25 a.m.
). They continued to circle the southeast shoreline and the area off Cooper Point spit (this is just NW of Olympia, at the very southern tip of Puget Sound) for more than one hour. We have lived here only one year, but have heard of no recent sightings of orcas in the South Sound. Is this an unusual event?
