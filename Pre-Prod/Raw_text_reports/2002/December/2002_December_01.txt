Orca Sightings for December 1, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Deborah Heg called to report a pod of orcas close to the Whidbey shore near Admiralty Inlet at

2:25 pm
, close in to the Whidbey side.
*
Elsa Leavitt called from Bush Pt, to report the orcas were there at

2:55
, still headed south - a whole BUNCH of them, spread out -
*
...we found the orcas off Whidbey after getting two calls about a pod off the west side this afternoon. We found them just south of Bush Pt. at around

3:30 pm
. Several groups were traveling south, mid-channel, the groups spread out but with several tightly bunched pods. Lots of activity - breaches, tail lobs, and porpoising, and they were traveling at a pretty good clip. A Coast Guard cutter was out there - guess there were no terrorists out there today, so they were able to get in some whale watching instead ; ) Also a big container ship passed near the whales, and the whales didn't seem to deviate their travel or behavior pattern at all. We followed the pods south, and got an even better look at them from Double Bluff at around
4 pm
. There were LOTS of whales - most likely all three pods, L's & J's for sure, as there were many mature males (large dorsal fins), and probably K's as well. I thought I caught a glimpse of a calf or two, but they were fairly far out and the daylight was fading, so difficult to see too clearly.

15 or more Orca in mid channel headed south between Windmill Heights and Foul Weather Bluff. Too far to identify, I need better Binocks...

Two float planes started circling is what called my attention to them. Orcas, not alot, and really spread out heading south down the shipping lane west of Mutiny Bay. Late reporting cause was on the phone to the east coast and shared it with them.
