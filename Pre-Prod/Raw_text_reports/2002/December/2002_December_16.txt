Orca Sightings for December 16, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
No direct reports yet, but a pod of orcas were filmed by KIRO TV today, giving passengers on the Vashon Island ferry a thrill!

Hi Susan
A report, unconfirmed of Whales inside the Victoria breakwater at
1620
, I got there at 1627 no whales. A report at
1630
they were going E. but a heavy rain squall and wind, no sightings. It all sounded good but I did not see a fin or blow.
