We received a call from Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, with a report of their encounter with the whales sighted in San Juan Channel today:
J, K and L pods were ALL present - they passed Friday Harbor going south at approx.

1:30 pm
, and headed south about 4 miles, then went through Cattle Pass at

3:45 pm
. Ken said they were able to account for all the whales in each pod, including the new L & K pod babies - and confirmed there are no new calves for J pod at this time.

I just returned from a meeting on Orcas Island on the

12:20 PM
ferry to Friday Harbor, and lots of orcas came surfing by on the port side of the ferry. The ferry captain spotted them first and announced where they were as they approached. At least 12 to 18, and two little calves visible. One of the ferry workers identified them as J-pod.

We saw a large pod of Orcas off our house today at about

1:00 pm
. There may have been as many as 28 of them, many males and some babies in the rear. We live on Point Caution at the foot of Sutton Drive, 2 miles NW of Friday Harbor.
Thanks,
