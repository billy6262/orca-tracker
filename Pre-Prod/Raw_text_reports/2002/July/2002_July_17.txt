We were with J's, K's and some of L's off of Kellett bluff, (Henry Island) and stayed with them as they went to Stuart. They were still going north when we left. The whales were very spread out, like yesterday, with lots of socializing and play along with foraging. They were breaching, spyhopping, tail lobbing, you name it! All the boats were dead in the water for very long periods of time. We had lots of close passes just sitting still. One of the new kids, not sure which, was doing a lot of jumping around. A great sign of a healthy youngster. Cheers,
