We met up with the whales on the west side of North Pender Island today aroun
2:00pm. The L-12s and L-22s were behind a large group of what appeared to be all of J and K Pod. It turned out that the L-2s were in there as well...resting along with Js and Ks. It was neat to see Luna's mom out and about. Gaia/L-78 appears to have begun sprouting! Although he is a year older than Skana/L-79 he is a bit behind in size but the process has definitely begun.
