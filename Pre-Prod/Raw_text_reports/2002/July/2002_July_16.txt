Orca Sightings for July 16, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's and K's are now using Active Pass going N. Boundary Pass to return to Haro St. not Rosario. They did both yesterday (
July 15).
L12's seem to be happy going N. to Active Pass area and S. to Salmon Bank.
Whales reported going E. off Sooke at 0900 today (
July 16) but fog and rough water prevented any id, they were not seen later in the day. 1108 at 48 29 .475 123 07 .401 there is always something magical about making contact with whales in the fog. J1 and some K's going S. 1214 the first bow riding Dall's in a few weeks.
