Orca Sightings for July 4, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Report of whales off Eagle Pt. around 0945 also whales off Victoria at the same time. I had Lpod going W. just west of Race Rocks at 1052. No other whales seen. No whales found off San Juan Is.
At 1556 contact with Lpod once more still going W. near Magdalena Pt. (west of Jordan River) no other whales seen at this time.
At 1630 a report that J1 has popped into the picture and over the next few minutes more reports of Jpod whales coming in from the west. At this time I am on my way back to Victoria when reports of Kpod whales going west from Sheringham Pt. start to come in. Made contact with Kpod at 1650 going west but reports are now coming in that J's and L's have turned and are now E. coming towards the K's. It would seem that Jpod went West first in the early morning followed by Lpod.
Kpod were the whales off Eagle Pt. who must have swung S.W. towards Port Angeles thus were missed by the American boats on the west side of San Juan Is. and came W. in Juan de Fuca well off shore.
