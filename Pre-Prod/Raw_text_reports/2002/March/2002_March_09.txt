Orca Sightings for March 9, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb reports hearing Southern Resident orcas on the Center for Whale Research's hydrophone at
7:20 pm Saturday night (west side of San Juan Island).
*

1:30 pm: Single grey whale, judging by the spout, ~ 2 miles out from Pt. Partridge (west Whidbey Island) slowly moving north :-)
*
We've been seeing spouts off Camano (south end) for the last 15 minutes (
3:30p), though we can't see a body at all (most likely one of the grays that has been feeding in Saratoga Passage this week).
