Orca Sightings for March 7, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call this morning that there were three gray whales off Hidden Beach (Greenbank, East Whidbey Island, in Saratoga Passage) at 8 am. We later went down to the bluff to find them, saw two blows, looked like possibly a mom and calf, a bit further north, closer to the Camano side of the passage; and one blow closer to the Whidbey side and just off Hidden Beach. We think they were heading north, but we only saw them blow once or twice, elusive critters! It's wonderful to know it is gray whale season here in Greenbank again - spring must be around the corner, even though there is a slight dusting of snow on the ground this morning~

Susan,
While enroute from NAS Seaplane Base at 10 o'clock to conduct diving operations south of Langley today, my dive team observed a single whale in Saratoga Passage between Whidbey's Shangri-La Shores and Glenwood Beach. It was working the deeper waters closer to Camano Island . We were too far away to be able to positively identify the animal's species. I believe it was a grey. Very healthy spouts while on surface!
