Hi All:
Upon returning home tonight (3/28) I heard Southern Residents over SeaSound at
21:15. After the tanker noise died down I could hear the calls better- first there were L-calls for about 45 minutes, then Js, and then K-calls mixed with Js. This continued at the same distant level for over an hour and a half- the calls are just fading out now as I write this at
23:00. I suspect they were either on the Vancouver Island side of Haro Strait or else milling out off Middle Bank. I do think definitely J-Pod with at least some contingent of L-Pod; if not all three pods. This would be a new record for March. No guess on direction, keep your eyes open tomorrow.

8 transients chased a group of Harbor Porpoise from just North of Sidney Spit almost to the Swartz Bay ferry dock where they killed 3, this was just after dawn this morning, which was 0559 over here. They then moved slowly through Satillite Ch. to the West side of Saanich Inlet turned South just North of Hatch Pt. went South passed Whisky Pt. at 1030 turned North and were last reported going North back to Hatch Pt. at 1100. Also whales reported off Open bay going South at 1030.
