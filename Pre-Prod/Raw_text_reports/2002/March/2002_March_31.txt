Orca Sightings for March 31, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
My wife and I, and two friends, followed the advice in my newspaper on where to see gray whales and went out to First Beach at LaPush on Sunday (
March 31). There we watched four gray whales having Easter dinner in the surf off the Lonesome Creek RV Park -- they spent hours zipping across the bottom, spouting, flashing their flukes and tails and popping up now and then to eyeball us and other tourists on the beach.
