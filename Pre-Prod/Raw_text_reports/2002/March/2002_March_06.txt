============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
Got a beautiful Gray Whale show this morning (
March 6), around
10:30, heading west in the Saratoga Passage. They stopped to feed and then went on their way towards Langley. While here they were very visible and stayed for about 30 minutes. Ya' gotta love it!
Jen in Sandy Point
The grays are on the move as of 0900 this morning (
March 6) no less then 12 whales have passed Cabe Beal Light Station (west coast Vancouver Island) on their way north.
