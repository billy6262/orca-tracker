Dear Susan,
Tonight at just before
5:00 p.m. we heard echolocation clicks on the radio as we pulled in to San Juan County Park. We saw J-1 about a quarter mile out and several females close in. They were heading south. We picked them up again just past Lime Kiln, then again at Land Bank. We watched them for about 45 minutes. We counted 15 orcas as they passed Land Bank. In addition, there were several more females who were leading the pod. Two females were traveling several hundred yards out, with what appeared to be a baby, but J-pod has no babies, so I don't know what this was. One of the adult females had a saddle that looked like K-13's, but I thought K-pod was out to sea. The baby was on the surface for about 30 seconds frolicking. Then it did a tail slap before it disappeared with the females. Has part of K-pod been traveling with J-pod?
Bringing up the rear were six females with two juveniles. They were traveling about 20 yards off the rocks. One of these orcas spyhopped and appeared to look us over before going on. They all disappeared before Edwards Point. This is our first report. We'll try to keep it shorter next time.
