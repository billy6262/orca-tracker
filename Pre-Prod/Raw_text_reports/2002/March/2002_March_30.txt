Orca Sightings for March 30, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research: 35 - 37 Southern Resident orcas were reported off Grays Harbor on Saturday,
March 30th at approx. 3 pm, traveling south
*
Lousie Salmin called at
11:45 with a report of a gray whale in Saratoga Passage, due north from East Pt (Greenbank area, at entrance to Holmes Harbor). It was mid-way between Whidbey and Camano Islands.
*
At
12:20, our friends Amy and Charlotte Massey and family (also good friends of Lolita!), saw a gray whale from the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry, right in front of the Clinton ferry dock, headed northeast. They also saw some Dall's porpoise from Greenbank at 1 pm, and later from our bluff at around 2 pm.
*
Connie Farence called at
3:50 pm to tell us that two grays were in front of the Dog House Tavern in Langley (the best whale watching spot on the island). They were mid-way in Saratoga Passage, heading north - we're hoping they'll swing past Greenbank before it gets dark....
*
Then this message just in from Brian Lowey - A couple of grays off sea wall park in Langley at
4:30 this afternoon, swimming slowly across to Camano Island.

Hi
Whales in Saanich Inlet all day yesterday and there this morning 0850. 8+ not sure who they are as I have not seen them but reports seem to indicate transients.

And then these reports on Grays having breakfast off east Whidbey this morning:
Been hearing and watching the Grays in Saratoga Passage since
6:00 this morning. Three miles north of Langley close to Bell's Beach.

Three (gray) whales spent 2 plus hours @ Bells Beach this morning between
5:30 and
7:30am feeding! Heading south. The whole neighborhood was out with bed heads and coffee! Love it!
