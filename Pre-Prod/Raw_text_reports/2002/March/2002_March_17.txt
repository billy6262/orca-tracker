Orca Sightings for March 17, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around 9am Sunday morning, I heard a funny noise and looked out into the Saratoga Passage off Maple Cove (south of Langley, Whidbey Island) to see that the rarely-seen Victoria Clipper ship had stopped. Binoculars told me that many of the passengers were up top looking back at the wake. After about 10 minutes, they left, surely disappointed. A minute or two later, I saw several breaches and tail flips of a gray whale headed slowly south.

I actually can report a sighting! After chasing so many other sightings I was able today to see "Springer" the young Orca of Vashon. Since the high tech high dollar banged up aluminum skiff with a "research" sign taped to the side was also present I realized I need not record the time. My wife and I walked on and took the ferry across after waiting one sailing to try to get the Evergreen State which apparently wasn't in service and didn't see the Orca. We were going to have lunch at the La Playa restaurant when the Evergreen State which had been tied up moved to load cars. We decided to forgo lunch. Very glad we did. Springer put on a great show. There is no better show for the price in Washington. A great little trip even if we didn't see the Orca but we did. Tell all your landlocked friends.
