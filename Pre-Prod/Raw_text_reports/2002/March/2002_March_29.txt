Hi Susan and Howie,
It's overcast today but I did spot a blow just now (
1:45 PM) heading around Sandy Point in the Saratoga Passage. The whale seems to be alone and lazily moving towards Langley. Yesterday (3/28) we had a very nice show in the morning from 3 grays which appeared to be 2 adults and a calf. Have a great holiday.

And at
2:20 pm we had a call from Mary Pacher about a Gray whale near Greenbank, in Saratoga Passage, heading north. Howie was home and got to watch it from

2:30 - 3 pm as it continued north past Hidden Beach.....I was off making copies and missed them - darn!
