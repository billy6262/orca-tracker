Orca Sightings for April 12, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Found J-pod off Eagle pt this afternoon (
April 12) around
14:30. They moved to the Cattle Pt bouy, then turned west and headed back towards Pile pt. Off of False Bay, a Minke popped up and lead them along the tide line until we left. An overcast day, but flat calm.....

This is to add to your J-pod report. We started tracking J-pod off False Bay at about
10:50 a.m. (
April 12), going north. We went up to Land Bank (just south of Lime Kiln). We watched J-pod from Land Bank from
11:10 a.m. to
11:45 a.m., when they changed directions and headed south rapidly. We never say J-1 this morning. We picked J-pod up again at about
5:00 p.m. just south of Lime Kiln. We last saw them out in Haro Strait heading north at about
6:00 p.m., pretty much in a line, with J-1 in the middle.

I get to report a first-hand whale sighting of J pod off west San Juan Island, at
11:45 this morning (
April 12). Dave Ellifrit of the Ctr. for Whale Research and I watched them for an hour - first they were headed north from the False Bay area, then reached Lime Kiln Pt. & turned south again. J1 was off False Bay & out further, the rest of the pod came in close to the rocks - lots of tail lobbing, milling about, a few great spy hops - a great encounter, & all whales were accounted for by Dave, the whale ID whiz kid.....
