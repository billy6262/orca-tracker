Hi Susan,
This is Angela at Salish Sea Charters - I'm one of Captain Tom's naturalists. He asked me to send you the following report - Capt. Tom was returning from the WWOANW meeting in Canada last night when he came across J pod. They were at Andrews Bay on San Juan Island and appeared to be northbound at the time. (He thinks they may have turned after that, judging from what he heard on the radio) Rich Osborne was on the boat and positively identified Ruffles and Granny, which is always great to hear. Hope you have a good day and thanks again for the great website - I have been referencing it quite a bit as I prepare my interpretive materials for this year.
