Orca Sightings for April 29, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
Hallelujah! I'm very excited to report my first orca sighting off the west side of Lummi I. for the year!! (caught again without binoculars on my run!) There was a group of 10-12 spread far out across the channel traveling south towards Legoe Bay and Rosario Strait at
11:00 a.m.- a few tight groups of 2-3 like moms and juveniles very close to shore, doing those beautiful slow motion high porpoisings, and individuals way far out, a couple of breaches. Didn't see a big male - could have been even further out (?). No boats. Just a gorgeous panorama of whales and water....Oh happy day!

Kari Koski & Doug McCutcheon reported seeing J pod while bringing the SoundWatch boat back to San Juan Island on their way back from Vashon. They were near Colville (SE pt. of Lopez), heading down from Rosario. There were at least 15 whales, including J1, 26 & 36. They saw the pod head west at
4:30 near Charles Island, off the south end of Lopez

And several A73 reports from this morning, Sat, & Weds:
Jeff Hogan, one of our Ferry Volunteers from Vashon Island, called in a live report on A73 from the ferry this morning (
April 30) at
11:15. He said she was 10' off the Vashon Ferry Dock, mostly logging on the surface, but rolling over once next to the ferry. He said her whale pox looked a little more extensive, covering more of her skin.
Jeff helped out this weekend with The Whale Museum's Sound Watch boat, which is patrolling the area on weekends to let boaters know they need to stay away from the orca calf. Here's his report from Saturday:
Hi Susan,
I volunteered with Soundwatch yesterday. Not very many boats which was good. We watched her play with her log for hours on end. She seemed to have a lot of energy and just kept playin and playin and playin. She loves her log. We had some Dalls get very close to her but neither of them interacted.
Talk to you soon.
Jeff
Jeff said this morning that he did see a few boats approach the calf on Sunday after the Sound Watch boat left. Let's all help Sound Watch spread the word to boaters to keep their distance from A73 - many thanks to Sound Watch for doing this great service!
Susan
Sunday,
