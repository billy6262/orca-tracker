Orca Sightings for April 5, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
On
April 5th we sighted two Grey Whales between Mariner's Cove and Polnell Point (NE Whidbey Island). They were feeding and spent several hours in the area.
Keep up the great work!

More reports of the large group of orcas up north - sounds like they are transients, and this large of a pod of transients is highly unusual.....we'll send on more information as more reports and ID's come in - in the meantime, here are some great reports~

Hi Susan:
We were with close to 30 (orcas) in Cowichan Bay today. Probably T-10 (Transient) sub group I am told.

Today we saw between 20 and 30 transient Orcas, more than I've ever seen at once. What a thrill. The Annie Mae was the only boat from San Juan Island to get there, he said proudly. We left them at
3:30 leaving Cowichan Bay, B.C., over near Duncan, headed east.

Dear Susan and Howard,
Back from a trip to Cowichan Bay near Duncan, B.C. where there were approximately 20 to 25 transients.
Indentified T-10, T-153 and T-154. They came out of the bay and then back in several times.
