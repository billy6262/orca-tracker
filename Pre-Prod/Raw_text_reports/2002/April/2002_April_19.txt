Orca Sightings for April 19, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Judy Lochrie, one of our Ferry Naturalist Volunteers, was on the Vashon/Fauntleroy ferry yesterday (
April 19), and spent some time at the Vashon ferry dock with A73, watching her play near the surface, tail-slapping, spy-hopping, etc. She said she was right by the ferry dock for 1 & 1/2 hours, & each time the ferry came in, A73 would swim out of the way just before it docked.
