Orca Sightings for April 16, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called in a report he'd received from Arrow Launch, of a small female orca near SE Guemes Island on Tuesday,
April 16. Shane thought it might possibly have been "Foster" or "Wilma", the Pseudorca that's been seen around lately.

We watchers on Bells Beach (Whidbey Island) off Saratoga passage saw two grays this am (
April 16) about 715am going toward Langley and feeding! What a wonderful time of the year!

Hi Susan & Howie,

12:05 pm we sighted 4 transients off O'Neil Island in San Juan Channel traveling south towards FH. Close to Yellow Island the adult breached 50 yards from the Bon Accord. The pod consisted of 1 adult male, 1 adult female and two offspring. I think they were Q2 - T07A, Q10 -T07B, Q14 -T007C, and T07B1 per Robin's I.D. guide. (Where is Robin when you need him?) At
3:00 pm, on the way back we encountered them again in front of FH.
Regards, Rik Karon

Dottie Granger from South Camano Island called to report one or two orcas between Camano and Whidbey Islands, headed north at
6:20 pm. We received the message at
8:15, and went to the bluff to see if we could find them (from North Bluff, Greenbank area). Didn't see any orcas, but could hear blows to the north of us, and found two Gray whales feeding very close in to shore. We listened and watched the grays for half an hour, and scanned for the orcas, but never did find them.
