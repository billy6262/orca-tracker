Kelly Williams this morning: Two gray whales in Saratoga Passage, approx. 1 mile north of Langley, heading east toward Langley.
*
From the
5:30 p.m. ferry saw grays mid-channel between Mukiltteo and Clinton a bit south of the ferry crossing lanes. I saw at least 2 spouts; someone else said they saw 5 at one time; difficult to tell which way they were heading. At around
6:30 I saw one gray feeding about a quarter mile north of Langley, within 100 yards of shore. I walked up the beach and watched till it got dark.
