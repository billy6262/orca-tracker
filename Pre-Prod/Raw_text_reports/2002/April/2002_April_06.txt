Gail Fleming of Langley, Whidbey Island, called to report a whale in Saratoga Passage between Sandy Pt. & Camano Head at
5:15 pm. She was unsure what kind of whale it was, but it breached, and looked black.

We went out to the bluff at approx.
6:40 pm to take a look in case any orcas may be out in Saratoga Passage near Greenbank - didn't see any orcas, but immediately heard and saw two gray whales spouting in the entrance to Holmes Harbor. They appeared to be feeding, and were zig-zagging back and forth, fluking and diving. We watched until about 7, when it was getting too dark to see much.
