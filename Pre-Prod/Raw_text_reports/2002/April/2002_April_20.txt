Hi
Once more J17, J28 and J35. A report of a possible violent conflict between these J's and some other J's on Salmon Bank a few days ago. The whales came down Boundary Pass this morning around Turn Pt. then went into Open Bay for most of the afternoon. Started going S. around 1630. Lots of Dall's mid Haro St. in the pm.

Hi- Just spent the last half hour,

7:30-
8:00 PM, watching a single gray whale feeding south of Mabana (South Camano) and very slowly moving north. As the tide was still out a ways, he was feeding off the drop-off. Also spotted a second gray in mid channel moving toward East Point on Whidbey. Earlier today, there was evidence of fresh gray feeding on the beach at about the 1.0 foot tide mark.
