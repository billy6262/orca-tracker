Orca Sightings for April 9, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Chris Dunagan of the Bremerton Sun reported a call from a Bremerton Ferry Capt. of one whale off the Bremerton ferry dock (presumably a gray, but now known??).

Saw the tail end of a gray (no pun intended!) in Saratoga Passage, off Bells Beach about
7:15 am 4/9/02.

Hi Susan and Howie:
The grays are getting to be so common here in the East Point area (Saratoga Passage, entrance to Holmes Harbor) that I don't run up to the computer any more. Just now (Tues. Apr. 9) the big gray with the matched white spots on its flukes moved through going West. This morning on the ferry the captain pointed out a lone gray moving from the Mukilteo dock northward.

Just got a call from Neil on "Island Roamer." He had just spotted a pod of 4 transient Orcas near the south end of Pender Island (Canadian Gulf Islands).
