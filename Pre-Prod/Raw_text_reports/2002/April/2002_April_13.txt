Had 3 transient killer whales at Salmon Bank around 1500 today. Sorry, they were too far away for me to id, but I did hear rumors of T14, T20 and T21 on the VHF. I watched them and about 7 commercial whale watch boats round Cattle Point, then head slowly up the channel. At around 1620 all the boats had left and they were alone, traveling tight and slow still heading up San Juan Channel. It was nice to see killer whales, even if they weren't the southerns!
