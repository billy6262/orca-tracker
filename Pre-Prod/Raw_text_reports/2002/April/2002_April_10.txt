Orca Sightings for April 10, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie:
This morning (
April 10) the grays woke me at
4:30 with a loud spout outside my window (East Pt, Whidbey Island, Saratoga Passage). It was still too dark to see how many were there (thanks to Daylight Savings) but I believe there were 2. Sure is spooky seeing those huge shapes so close to the bulkhead! Is this a great place we live, or what?

Hi Susan
We dined at the Dog House last night (
April 10) and just as our dinners arrived 2 grays swam into view from the north!! They ate their way from one end of Langley (east Whidbey Island) to the other followed by 200 (as estimated by my older son Ethan) waterfowl eating the leftovers...lots of flipper, tail and spouting action. My younger son (barely 2) declared them orca whales then conceded they were humpbacks (the only whales he knows so an unreliable IDer). A glorious evening in Langley -- we are so lucky to live here!!

Gray whale sightings reported
By Christopher Dunagan
Sun Staff
Two separate reports of a gray whale the past two days may mean that a massive marine mammal is visiting the Bremerton area.
The first sighting was in Rich Passage shortly before 4 p.m. Tuesday, when a ferry captain arriving in Bremerton announced to his passengers that he spotted a whale, according to Mary Shore of South Kitsap.
Another sighting was made before 10 a.m. Wednesday near the Warren Avenue Bridge, when Ivan Summers of Kitsap Audubon spotted a gray whale traveling north.
"I couldn't believe my eyes," Summers said. "It was a big beast, mottled with white patches, really impressive."
No other sightings were reported to The Sun, but Wednesday was a gray, rainy day and people may not have been paying much attention to the water.

First, a report from me, who had the pleasure of hearing whales from the hot tub at
12:30 am! It sounded like 2 gray whales feeding off Hidden Beach/North Bluff - in Saratoga Passage just north of the Holmes Harbor entrance. They appeared to be moving south-east, either into Holmes Harbor or across over to Baby Island & East Pt.

12:48pm Captain Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters just called to report that he is with a large number of orcas about half way between Kelp Reef and Lime kiln Lighthouse on the west side of San Juan Island. He has identified Ruffles and believes that it is all of J-Pod. The are heading South at this time.

Dear Susan and Howard,
J pod passed south on the west side of San Juan Island around noon. About 20 whales were seen and there were extensive and loud echolocation clicks and some discrete calls as well as several breeches etc.
