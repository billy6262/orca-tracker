Aloha Susan,
I was just down at Beverly Beach this evening at
6:00 pm and saw a gray whale spout in Holmes Harbor (Whidbey Island) a couple times. It was pretty far away, but looked like it was almost to Freeland

We watched A-73 (Springer) for about an hour this evening from Lincoln Park in Seattle. Although she was a couple of miles away, those with good binocular skills should have no trouble observing her from there. The little gal was real busy all the while we watched her, getting into a hot pursuit now and then - treating us to some B-I-G tail slaps and even a breech!
It was a gorgeous evening and there wasn't a boat in sight, other than the ferry traffic. She did seem to gravitate toward the Evergreen State a bit, following it partway across toward Fauntleroy, but appeared mostly interested in checking out the trailing fan of the boat's wake - at least that's the way it seemed to me. She looked WONDERFUL! Go, Springer!
