Orca Sightings for August 30, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients in Saratoga Passage last Friday ... between 11am and
1:30 or so, in the area between Baby Island/North Bluff/and Camano Island State Park. They were swimming tight circles, changing directions and looked like they were feeding on all those seals that inhabit this area. I had to leave for the afternoon, so didn't get to see what direction they headed off in - maybe we'll get some reports from Mosquito Fleet or Island Adventures, and hopefully will have some positive ID's on this pod soon.

Just got a call from Randall Ernst reporting four orcas in Saratoga Passage, between the North Bluff/Baby Island area and Camano Island State Park, the same area the four transients were in Tuesday evening. I can ALMOST see them from our porch, but am working on a grant deadline, so can't go out and watch too long, but wanted to pass the word along for those of you on Saratoga Passage who might be able to catch a glimpse of them from your homes or nearby beaches. How exciting!!
Thursday,
