Orca Sightings for August 17, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Susan,
I went out with San Juan Safaris on Saturday (
August 17th) and it was the perfect completion of my first summer in the Northwest. We went on a
5:30p.m. cruise and headed out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. After about 45 minutes of traveling, we ran into all three pods. It was amazing! There were spouts everywhere. Spy hops, tail slaps, jumps...the whole show! We had the opportunity to see one of the L pod sprouters (we think Hugo) attempting to mate with what we think was a K pod female. Let's hope he found success! I've been waiting for a moment like this all summer and to see all of them surrounding us in a one or two mile radius was just awesome.

Lots of fog in the am out west, no whale reports.
At about 1300 J's, K's and L's found south of Victoria going E. slowly. By 1630 they were 11 miles S. of Discovery Is. but had decided to go east with a bit more determination.
