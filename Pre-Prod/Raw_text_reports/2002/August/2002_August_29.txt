Orca Sightings for August 29, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Captain Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called us at the Center for Whale Research this morning at
10:15 to report the L-12's at Eagle Pt. heading north. Just north of False Bay, at around Pile Pt, they turned and headed south. Other whales were reported at Cypress Island headed south at 8 am. Pat Rasmussen called and reported whales off south west San Juan Island at American Camp at around
1:30. We went down to American Camp around 3 pm, and watched whales spread out and milling, and beginning to head south east toward Hein Bank. We talked to others there who said earlier they had been in real close to the rocks.

L12's going South from the False Bay area at 1054. J's and K's in Rosario going S. At 1444 they were all together off Eagle Pt.
