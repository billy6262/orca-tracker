Orca Sightings for November 7, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
Around
1230
today we got a heads up call from Charlene (Wendt) of whales heading south. It was J and K pods tight and close to shore heading south at a medium speed. It was sunny and rough-a very cool passby! There were a couple of spyhops right in front of the house. The fin whale necropsy was last night so there is a faint aroma of dead whale around here at the moment. Hope all's well there.
