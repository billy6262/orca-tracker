Hi Susan and Howie,
It’s 1930 and I’m hearing southern residents on the hydrophone. I could not hear any blows do to the wind but I would guess they were going north.

P.S. to my last message.---The Orca's were really close in, not out in the shipping lanes like the big group heading south last week.

And I caught up with the whales reported off the west side of Whidbey at about

9:50 am
. I watched them from Lagoon Pt., though they were way over on the other side by then, closer to Marrowstone Pt, and heading north. There were approx. a dozen orcas, with at least one male, possibly J1 but between the distance and the wind blowing the scope it was hard to get a really good look. When I first saw them, they seemed to be milling and feeding, but then definitely moved north, traveling abreast in a resting pattern. I observed them until about

10:15
, then tried to find them again further north, but the wind and waves made for difficult conditions and I was unable to relocate them.
