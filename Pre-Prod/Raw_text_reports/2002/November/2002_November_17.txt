Orca Sightings for November 17, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Noon:
There are several orcas passing Bush Point as I write. I counted ten but there may be fewer. It is hard to tell. They are having a great time. They are heading south, traveling rather rapidly

Tom McMillen left them Sunday (Nov. 17) at
4 pm
east of Pt. Wells near Edmonds. They were spread out and still heading south, and he had so far identified only L pod whales.

At
1040 AM
a large group of whales was seen south bound off the point at Point Wilson (just west of Port Townsend). 7-15 animals were noted moving rather fast with some eye hopping and breaching. Thanks and I hope you can use this info.
