Brrr...cold hands trying to type. Spent the last several hours watching the whales make their way from Alki down the East side of Vashon. Last spotted just off of Dilworth Point traveling (with Marks fabulous yellow boat) south at

3:00PM
. Hope to catch up with them again but actually had to stop to do a little work.

Hi Susan, I'm so excited, I actually have a sighting report from Queen Anne Hill in Seattle! After reading the report that there was a pod of orcas outside of Elliott Bay, the Save Our Wild Salmon staff agreed to take a "whale break" and walk up to Kerry Park, on top of Queen Anne near our office. Sure enough, at about

11:30
when we reached the park we looked out and saw splashes about midway between Alki and West Point, a bit outside of the mouth of Elliott Bay. Tragically none of us had binoculars, but they were definitely orcas and we did see one sort of half-breach. They appeared to be heading south. I never thought I'd be reporting whales from my office!

Also had a phone report from Bernard in West Seattle that ~20 orcas passed Alki Pt. at

12:30

HI Susan-
Just got a call from some folks at the UW Friday Harbor Labs that a group of 5-6 Orcas were seen going past the labs around

11:00
and were last seen in San Juan Channel headed south. Apparently they were very active, breaching, splashing etc. I haven't heard if they checked out the Fin Whale on the mooring or not, but they had to have gone right past it, must have been a strange sight for them.

Hi Susan,
I just got word from folks at the Friday Harbor Labs that 5 to 6 orcas have been in San Juan Island by Pt. Caution since
11:00. We're going to go have a look. If they are transients, they might be interested in the fin whale carcass that's now tied to a buoy out there.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report a pod of orcas heading south at

9:30 am
this morning off Pt. Monroe, near Shilshole. He observed at least one male, but said they were out quite a distance and moving fast, making ID's difficult. At

10:30
they were off West Pt, heading across toward the Seattle area, possibly going into Elliott Bay. At 11, they were still in the middle, heading south, about halfway between West Pt. and Alki Pt.
