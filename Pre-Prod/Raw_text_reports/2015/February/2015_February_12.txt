picked them up again. They have turned west and seem to be heading slowly towards Penn Cove. They are mid channel at intersection of passage and cove entrance.

9:44am -
they were mid channel. I think they are still heading north, probably up near madrona beach by now (out of sight for me). I didn't see them turn and go into Penn Cove. If they do, I'll report that.

right now heading north or possibly to Penn Cove. Krista Paulino
