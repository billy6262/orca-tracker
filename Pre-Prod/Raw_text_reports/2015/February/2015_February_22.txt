Orca Sightings for February 22, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bob Affinito called at

9:30 am
this morning to report seeing two orcas very close to shore,
heading north near Albion CA
. One was an adult male. They were just south of Salmon Creek and north of Navarro.
*

2:05 PM -
Spotted approximately
4 Orcas passing Fox Spit
in Saratoga Passage between Whidbey Island and Camano. -Jim Lovvorn
*
A glorious sunny day with fellow Orcaholics watching
transient orcas passing Whidbey Island
under snow-capped Mt. Baker -Sandra Pollard
Identified by Melisa Pinnow as the
T046
family.
*
ID'd as the
T046s
, the first report had this pod of 5 mammal eating type orcas on the south side of the
Clinton ferry dock on Whidbey Island
. They had killed something and fed in that location for an hour feet from the dock, briefly interrupting ferry travel and leaving many in awe. The pod then headed north at a fairly swift clip, stalling at
Sandy Point
where they made a second kill and stuck to this location for another hour. They then proceeded northwesterly into Saratoga Passage where 4 grouped up with one adult male trailing about 1/2 mile behind. We watched with a large happy crowd of people in Langley and followed them along as they kept a steady pace up the Passage. Eventually the trailing male caught up and tucked in with his family as they passed us veering towards
Camano Island State Park
still northbound direction. Alisa Lemire Brooks

Watched them for almost an hour right in front of our house (just south of the
Clinton dock

at least four
and definitely a baby or very young one with them. They put on quite the show! They headed north after playing near the Clinton dock for an hour or so. -Gwendine Ellis Norton
