============================================================

Entry 1:
9:34 -
from the bluff south of
Bush Point
could see they had feasted. Lost them for a few then re-sighted the pod now traveling northbound up
Admiralty Inlet
, mid channel. -Howard Garrett

9:07 am -
Renee Beitzel just texted from the Victoria Clipper, they are on scene with
Transient orcas
who are feeding on something
just south of Bush Point
(Whidbey Island) in Admiralty Inlet. "They were being very elusive. We weren't able to stay there long but when we first spotted them they were heading north then stopped to feed. When we left them they were still feeding. Hope someone else was able to get some eyes on them!"

2:45 pm -
Just watched a gray whale (possibly a humpback) feeding off
Point No Point
for about 20 minutes. I left there at about

2:45
. Seemed to be heading back south. We had seen it come up along the shore from the south, moving pretty fast until it got to the Point. -Ken Shawcroft

3:24pm -
It's gone. Headed west towards
Foul weather bluff
.

2:55pm -
Huge
Grey Whale (possibly a humpback)
20 yards off shore at

Talked to someone on the beach that
said it was a humpback
- looked just like the one that was here last week. Wish I'd seen it. -Connie Bickerton
