Orca Sightings for February 26, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
I keep thinking we have probably used all our luck up but things keep falling into place. By yesterday afternoon we were down to one day's fuel supply for the Zodiac. The whales have been
all over the coasts of Washington and Oregon
in the past two weeks but they managed to conveniently be
in the vicinity of the entrance to Grays Harbor
this morning allowing us to go in and quickly refuel. On the way back out we had just crossed the bar when we ran into the whales in the shipping channel, and in particular
L94 and the new calf
. This allowed us to spend more time with them, get a better look, and get a better photo (see photo of the day) than yesterday. In this photo you can see the fetal folds which indicates that the calf is only a few days old and this photo also seems to sum up the calf's vitality. Heading south, whales
foraging off the Long Beach Peninsula
this afternoon - 5 prey samples today. -Brad Hanson, lead researcher on the Southern Resident killer whale survey team
