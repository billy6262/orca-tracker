There have been
two sightings of killer whales near Neah Bay
recently. The first was reported by fishermen to me of a small group
(5-10) killer whales on Jan 30 at
9:50 am at Koitlah Point
(48 23.19 N, 124 36.02 W). The second sighting was by me on the
20th
. I observed a group of
5 killer whales offshore Wa'atch Point
(48 20.07N, 124 44.44W) at 4 pm. Attached are the best identification photos I collected. The group was a bit spread out and the lighting made it difficult to get good identification photographs. -Jonathan Scordino, Marine Mammal Biologist, Makah Fisheries Management
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research identified the two from Jon as
L25
.

K and L pods
under observation as they travel south in ocean. Christopher Dunagan reports: While
J pod continues to hang out in the Salish Sea
, NOAA's research cruise has shifted its focus to K and L pods, which have worked their way
south along the Washington Coast
to beyond the Columbia River.

More news from the orca cruise and location of tagged
L84
: The last map up through
February 18 showed the whales just
south of Grays Harbor
. They continued south until early morning on the 19th when they
reached the Columbia River
. They remained tightly grouped in that same general vicinity all day on the 19th with no apparent foraging - no fish chases, calls, or echolocation clicks all day. They had been trending north in the afternoon and evening but the early morning satellite tag location revealed they had reversed direction an started traveling south. By this afternoon we caught up with them just south of
Cape Lookout, Oregon
