Orca Sightings for February 23, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:40 -
we left after watching the
HB
with a happy crowd of humans. It was surfacing and fluking and keeping to the same general area.

5:12 -
It is
humpback
and she/ he is mostly milling and just now fluked.

4:58 -
we just spotted a whale (probably the
humpback) from Sunset Ave in Edmonds
mid channel between us and Possession Point moving southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
Just
saw it from the Sounder Train
! Thanks for posting this! -Caleb Thompson
*

6:00 pm -
Same whale
(humpback) about half hour before sighting at Sunset
.. a bit more when
northwest of north Edmonds
. -Stu Davidson

3:45pm -
He's back (again). Humpback off
shore of North Edmonds
with southerly direction. Probably about 1.5 miles out from Edmonds.

8:57am -
Direction: back and forth south and north...Currently south And definitely
a humpback
. White under flukes. Got some shots of repeated deep dives

8:20am -
whale blows offshore of north northwest of
Edmonds and south of Possession Point
. Couple blows then a huge bend over deep dive. Watching for a resurface to get possible direction. Likely the humpback. -Stu Davidson
*
Saw this guy today around
2 pm
right around the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge
!! -Laurie Littlefield-Wells
This appears to be
a humpback
from the tall shape of the blow. Gray whale blows are more V-shaped
.
*

7:45 AM - Saw gray or humpback
whale this morning about

7:45
off Sunset Beach, just south of the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge in University Place
. Spouts and several dives and resurfaces. Heading north. My son said there were white spots on the skin and I thought I saw a distinctive small fin close to the large tail, but hard to tell which whale it was. Definitely not an orca. -Brian Nathanson
*
not sure what this guys is? swam right under our boat. Right off of
Point Defiance by the Ferry terminal today at about 3pm
. -Laurie Littlefield-Wells
Pacific White Sided Dolphin

Entry 2:
(the 20th)
we were with the whales heading south off
Cape Lookout
. The whales continued south on the 21st and at about
1600
that day, near the mouth of the
Umpqua River
, in
central Oregon they abruptly turned north
. They continued
north on the 22nd
, sometimes up to 10 miles offshore. We observed alot of surface active behavior thoroughout the day - lots of spy hops - and at one point we observed numerous whales repeatedly breaching over a several minute period. Like the previous couple of days, we have observed no apparent foraging and with the exception of a several hour period shortly after the breach fest episode
they have remained quiet
. This morning we are back off
Cape Lookout
and they are slowing continuing north.
