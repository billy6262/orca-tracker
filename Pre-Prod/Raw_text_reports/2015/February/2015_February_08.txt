Orca Sightings for February 8, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
8 February update - As of the evening of 5 February when J27's tag turned back on from the day before the whales had continued to remain near the
western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. By the following afternoon (6 February) the whales had moved
southwest to the continental shelf break
. The duty cycle on J27's tag reverted back to every day on 6 February such that we were able to follow the whales movements that day and the next as they followed the edge of the continental shelf slope northward before turning east and reaching
the coast of Vancouver Island near Tofino
. They headed south and were

Entry 2:
. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging
*
First reported to Orca Network by Maia of WA State Ferries at
11:45am traveling southbound near the south end of Bainbridge Island, we caught up with
T087, the T90's & 3 (yet to be ID'd) individuals
further south at
Dilworth on Vashon Island at
2:45pm
. Shortly before, a friend witnessed the pod take an animal and as the video begins you'll see how very relaxed they appear. Nearly two hours later (approx.
4:40pm) they approached and
rounded Point Robinson
much to the happiness of a very patient, large and happy bunch of humans (and doggies). As they were passing the pod (s) grouped up tight just before going under for long dive, surfacing approximately 4-5 minutes later south of the point. We just had us another beautiful and exhilarating winter's day here in the PNW! -Alisa Lemire Brooks

I saw my first Transient kill today. When I met these T's, I was greeted by
T087
breeching on top of what I thought was a harbor seal. He then proceeded to either drag or chase it out to the deeper water to where the rest of the pod was waiting. They tail slapped, rolled around, and looked as though they were laying on top of something. There was more rolling and tail slaps. There was a lot of movement in different directions and a couple spy hops. Then a ton of gulls surrounded the whales. I speculated that they killed something. This was a pic of one of the spy hops where the orca shows off it's kill.
T090
has a left over SAT tag in the dorsal fin.
