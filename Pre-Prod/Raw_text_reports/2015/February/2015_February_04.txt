Orca Sightings for February 4, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:29 -
Had a report from a friend that there were
two orcas sighted around 5 pm
from the
Vashon Island Passenger Ferry
as it was pulling into the dock on the North end of the Vashon - nearer to Blake Island and no direction of travel. The Ferry captain announced the whales and slowed. Hmmmm...T's or??? -Amy Carey
Note: ID's were not determined for this sighting

Looks like potentially
a humpback off Edmonds
dog park! Not a grey and looks too big to be minke...Kind of milling around when we last saw it... Has been a lot of small herring and krill around of dog park... Perhaps good dining there. -Toby Black

There is
a humpback off Gig Harbor
this morning. Beth Bennett called about
9 am
while watching a humpback in Horsehead Bay, facing Fox Island from Gig Harbor. No direction of travel was obvious.
