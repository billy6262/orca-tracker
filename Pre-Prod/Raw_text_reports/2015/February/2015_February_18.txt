Orca Sightings for February 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
As mentioned in our
February 17 entry, we were able to intercept
Ks and Ls at the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and deploy a tag on
L84
. You may recall that our SRKW satellite tagging project began in 2012 with the tagging of J26. In addition, we now have data from a second J pod member (L87 who travels with J pod) in
January 2014 and most recently, the 6 week deployment in January and
February 2015 on J27. Collectively, these data indicate only limited use of the outer coastal waters by J pod. In 2014 NMFS was petitioned to designate Critical Habitat on the outer coastal waters of Washington, Oregon, and California. The data used for this petition was derived from only one sample - the range of K25 during the January to
March 2013 satellite tag deployment. Consequently, potential variability between pods and between years has led to making tagging a whale from L pod a high priority.
By being able to deploy a tag on L pod while on our cruise on the Bell M. Shimada we have the unique opportunity to now to be able to follow the whales each day (and potentially at night) and collect prey and fecal samples as well as other data about their environment this time of the year. While we know that K and L pods sometimes co-occur in the winter, this will potentially be an opportunity to see the degree to which they remain together. We are off to an exciting start - four prey samples yesterday and four fecal samples today while the whales transited from near Cape Ozette yesterday morning to near Willipa Bay this afternoon.
