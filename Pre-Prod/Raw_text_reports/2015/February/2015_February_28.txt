============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a report from Kerry Jess of
2-3 unidentified orcas
traveling southbound 1 mile out from shore, seen from shore just
north of Roberts Creek in the Sunshine Coast BC
.

5:50pm -
it's super close to shore (less than 1/4-mile out) and very close to
Edmonds
.

5:25pm
Just saw it viewing south from
Picnic Point

4:15pm -
Thar she blows! Couple new blows mile north of
Edmonds
ferry and about a mile west of north Edmonds. No direction travel yet.

1:45pm -
Couple blows back up this way. Them must have done a deep dive. Line of sight was between my place and point no point but near our side a lot. Closer in than my initial breaching shots this a.m. -Stu Davidson

The Whale Trail reported a
juvenile humpback off Coleman Dock
(via Ben Evans). I haven't seen any updates. -Connie Bickerton

11:20am -
Janine Harles and Paul Franklin saw blows sightline transect Sunset Ave to Eglon/Kitsap east of mid channel.
*

10:45 -
it started breaching sightline transect
Sunset Ave and Possession Pt
. Then an egregious act of harassment by small fishing boat...grrr. Called in to NOAA. Blows now to the south a ways.

10:20 -
just saw a blow east of mid channel sightline between Sunset Ave and Double Bluff whidbey. Maybe a mile out from
north Edmonds
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

10:18am -
It was breaching for over an hour straight! We were watching it breaching, in
between ocean and sunset avenue
way over
on kitsap side
. It suddenly stopped so assuming its diving?

10:06am -
Stu is going in to check his pics...has anyone seen it lately? It went on a dive.. -Janine Harles
*

9:11am -
They moved more south and further out towards
Kitsap side
. Might be better to see from fishing pier?!!

9:05 am -
Might be more than one. Seems like a mom and calf... Alternating breaching.. One looks smaller and gives smaller splash the other Huge splashes! (
I heard back from John Calambokidis at Cascadia Research, and Fred Sharpe with Alaska Whale Foundation - they do not believe it is a calf. One thinks it could possible be the pec fin of the humpback, the other thinks it could possibly be another species or ??? And also that the humpback we are seeing looks pretty small itself and is likely a juvenile too young to have a calf. -SB
)

8:15am -
Whale Repeated breaching. Looks like a
humpback
(confirmed). Mile out from
a mile north Edmonds
. -Stu Davidson
