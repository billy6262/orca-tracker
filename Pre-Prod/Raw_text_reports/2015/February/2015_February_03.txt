============================================================

Entry 1:
5:30 -
leaving now after watching
HB move southward along Edmonds
in mostly shallow surfacings...looked to be foraging north then south. Sometimes just roughing up the water. Several robust blows with last surface had HB 100 yards off shore out from north Edmonds (between ferry and Browns Bay).

4:50 -
for last 30 minutes have watched
HB move back east on Edmonds
side .5 miles from shore directly now out from Stamm overlook.

4:05 -
finally and by a little luck saw the HB surface a few times out from west end.
Off Cultus Bay close to Whidbey side northeast bound

shoreline. Mulling and sporadic breaching... Camera on the ready. -Stu Davidson

This whale was seen breaching at
1 pm (Bainbridge/Rich Passage whale
) making us pretty sure it is
one of the two humpbacks
reported yesterday. -Orca Network

OMG!!!! I just saw blows and whale jumping up into the air, splashing ... just now entering the point at
Manchester State Park
, moving at a good pace...into Rich Passage ~
westbound toward Port Orchard
.. seen from South Colby through binoculars ... heading out now. -Kathe Bradly

1:30 p.m.
we saw the whale surface twice relatively close to short in front of our house on
South Beach on Bainbridge
. It appeared to be heading east and then disappeared. -Lucy Schenk

Rich Passage
. Maia called again to say the whale was
headed east
, toward mid-channel.

Maia of WA State Ferries reports a whale [
probably a humpback
] is off Restoration Point, south end of Bainbridge Island,
headed west into Rich Passage
