I love these days! Leave the harbor and down comes the word! Lots of
Orcas west of Victoria
, headed west! Can we make there in time to see them?

Pacific white-sided dolphin
off of
Sooke
. Thanks to Paul from Sooke Explorations for relaying a report of killer whales westbound at Race Rocks late morning. We caught up with what looked like all of Kpod and most of L's off of Sooke in the afternoon. They were spread out across the Juan de Fuca heading west with the ebb current. They were starting to group up near Sheringham when we left them at 1530. -Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
