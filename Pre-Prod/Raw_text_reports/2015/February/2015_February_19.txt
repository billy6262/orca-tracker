west of Victoria
, headed west, playing with
Ks and Ls
! -Capt. Jim Maya
J50
the second newest calf in J Pod, J16's new daughter. Born in late
December 2014. It's thought that this little one had a hard birth due to the rake marks (scratches cause from killer whale teeth) on her body. It's speculated that she was helped and pulled from the womb. -Simon Pidcock

came down the West Side yesterday evening (2/18), then came back up early this morning. We caught up with them at
