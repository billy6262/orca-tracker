We saw
three orcas
today as we were on the

10:20am
ferry from
Anacortes to Friday Harbor
. I don't know the exact coordinates of the sighting but it was before the ferry docked at Lopez landing. -Claudia Wohlfeil

My neighbors here in
Irish Beach (50 miles north of San Francisco CA)
were walking on the beach a few mornings ago. They were down on the beach not on a bluff. They reported to me seeing
a gray about 200 yds
out going south. That part fits perfectly with what we see daily with slow poke juveniles. However they report
2-3 animals with dorsal fins
with it. I could not get a def on dorsal size or the size of the escorts in relation to the gray. -Scott Mercer
