Entry 1:

I was blessed to see
two Orca
close to shore (20-40 feet away) at
East Sooke Park
(S. Vancouver Island, BC) this
morning
. I only got one decent picture as they went around a point. By the time I could get to the trail that ran along the shoreline, they were gone. I waited in the area for a couple of hours hoping they'd return but it didn't happen. A magical experience! -Karen Kehler

They're heading past
Onamac on Camano
right now! -Desi Tracy

4:00pm -
From a vantage point on the bluff at
Seawall Park in Langley
I observed several very clear blows in binoculars near (north of) a sailboat between mid-channel and south Camano Island. One and possibly a second individual. -James Mott

Yet another wonderful whale day starting at

9:30 am
with
half-a-dozen gray whales
seen feeding close to
Langley shores
. Twenty minutes out of Langley 'Mystic Sea' spotted heart-shaped blows south of Sandy Point again close to shore, followed by sightings of
#49 Patch and #53 Little Patch
traveling side-by-side. Later pecs and tails (possibly #22) were seen close to shore in feeding mode on the Clinton side of the ferry lanes. Seems all whales today were having a gourmet lunch! -Sandra Pollard (Naturalist)

six gray whales off Langley
this morning, and Patch and Little Patch just north of the Clinton ferry dock.

10:05am -
For the past 1/2 hour I have been watching
four Grays
(no ID) feeding below our bluff on
Whidbey Island
, Saratoga Passage, moving from
Langley Marina toward Sandy Point
(southbound-ALB). I haven't seen evidence of Gray's, on our beach, for two years. I can still hear their "blows" through my open window. Very exciting. -Noel Goforth, Langley
*

8:48am - 3 grey whales
feeding in shallow, in the
Saratoga passage
just north of Langley, slowly making their way towards Langley! -Rachel Kellog Franklin
*
Thar she blows! Woke up this morning and said, "I think the whales will visit today." Walked outside with coffee in hand and within minutes heard the beautiful breath of
three gray whales
. Just passed by. At the
Inn at Langley
now. I may have gotten my first fluke shot in the passage. It's going to be a great day! -Debra Campbell

Pacific White-sided dolphin,
March 24, 25 & 26, Point Defiance and the Narrows
. First encounter was under sail, he joined us and and sailed all around with us for an hour following us. Then the next day he met us on the dingy going, we stopped ashore to drop off trash we collected then he joined us again when we left. He performed a few acrobatic jumps and spins. Then the 27th he showed up as we motored in the sail boat near the narrows. And we have more video from this day of him rubbing on the rudder. Very Odd. -Alan Niles
