Orca Sightings for March 3, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
the whales were just
north of Ocean Shores
. They circled back and spent the
4th and 5th traveling north
. They turned back south at
Cape Alava
early this morning. Our colleagues at Casacdia Research Collective intercepted them this morning off La Push in their research boat to attempt to collect additional prey and fecal samples and get a look at L121. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

*
At
6AM
this morning
4 Orca passed by Gold Beach on Maury Island
...the south end of Vashon Island. They were heading south in commencement bay. There was one male, two smaller whales, most likely females, and one calf. Shortly after their passing, a large number of seals were swimming very close to shore in shallow water.....I can understand why!! -Lars Strandberg

1:30pm -
I watched
gray whales
today for a couple of hours in
Useless Bay
. I was at the private access point on Shore Avenue. There were thousands of ghost shrimp washing up on shore. I believe there were at least two whales feeding. -Kristen Coombe
(
This report was posted on the 6th but we found it after the
March 7th announcement that Gray whale #723 was the first of the 2015 season of returning "Saratoga" Grays (see
March 7th sightings report). Given the location and southbound travel of #723 in south Possession Sound, there is the real possibility Kristen Coombes sighting was the first day of the returning Saratoga Grays
)

Entry 2:
Since our 25 February update we have continued to follow
L and K pods
onboard the Bell M. Shimada. During that time the whales movements have been
confined to the coastal waters and northern Oregon
. They were
offshore of Westport
on the 25th and by the 26th had moved to the nearshore waters off Westport. From there they turned south and by the morning of the 27th had traveled
as far south as Tillimook Head in northern Oregon
. From there they headed back north and by the 28th were offshore of
Westport again
. On the morning of 1 March we followed them north to
near LaPush
. Over the course of the 2nd they moved south and were just
north of Ocean Shores
this morning. One interesting aspect of their behavior over the past several days was that the whales have been
extremely spread out
- over several miles - both north and south and east and west. Thus, while we were able to launch the Zodiac and find a few whales and collect additional prey and fecal samples, we did not see all the whales on a given day. Consequently, we
didn't run into L94 so we don't have any additional reports on L121
. Because we had to be back in Newport by 3 March, the last day of our 21 day cruise, and given that northern Washington is over a day's run from Newport, we headed south on the evening of 1 March and spent the daylight hours of the 2nd transiting along the shelf break in Washington where we observed
Pacific white-sided dolphins, northern right whale dolphins, Risso's dolphins, as well as sperm whales, numerous fin whales
, numerous black-footed albatrosses, and a couple of Laysans's albatrosses. -Dr. Brad Hanson

3:40pm -
The whale (
humpback
) was just
north of Shipwreck
and close to shore -- last time I spotted it it was heading south towards shipwreck when it did a deep dive... I watched for another half hour before we cruised back to Edmonds Marina. The whale was very elusive...north then south quick surface and longer dives. -Stu Davidson
*

3:40pm - humpback
was blowing and fluking about every two minutes as it turned south out of sight close to shore.

3:23pm -
from
Mukilteo lighthouse
beach finally see blows and lunge and peck slap to the south 1 mile or more. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

3:04pm -
Spotted just off shore north of
Shipwreck
heading north at about 3 knots. There was a bald eagle playing in the whale's wake. What a sight! -Kristen Hardwick
*

3:30pm -
A friend of mine sent me this report from today. "This afternoon while walking in
Ft. Ward, (Bainbridge Island)
I saw a whale spout and then saw it's back. Looked like a
gray whale maybe
. Only one whale as far as I could see. It was towards Rich Passage, just past the fish farm, heading in the Bremerton direction. -Susan Marie Andersson for Marcy Lagerloef
*

2:50pm -
Still northbound and now out of our sight.
Mukilteo lighthouse
may be a good spot in a little bit...t was staying close to shore heading north about a mile south of Mukilteo lighthouse.

2:07pm -
Now northbound at
shipwreck
, about 300 yds offshore. -Rob Miller
*

1:33pm - Humpback whale
off
picnic point
again! Fairly close to shore headed south slow. When it passed us I'd say 1/4 mile off shore, looked as if it turned towards the southwest off Norma beach? -Toby Black
