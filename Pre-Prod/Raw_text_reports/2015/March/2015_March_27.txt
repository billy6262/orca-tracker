Orca Sightings for March 27, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Magical encounter with
J-pod off Victoria
. -Val Shore
*
We were incredibly fortunate to have caught up with
J Pod
again just
south of Discovery Island
. The day was glassy calm and warm - very out of the ordinary for March, but we're not complaining! We were also able to spend some good quality time with
J2 Granny
... At an estimated 104 years of age, she was acting quite spunky and spending a lot of time rolling around with J38 Cookie (born in 2003). She appears vibrant, healthy, and not a wrinkle on her! Must be all those Omega-3's in that lovely salmon...this was my first really good look at DoubleStuf this spring and I am amazed by his size! DoubleStuf was born in 1998 which puts him at 17 years of age and he still has growing to do. Onyx was born in 1992 and is considered to be fully mature, but I think after watching them the other day, DoubleStuf may have already passed him in terms of size. I also noticed DoubleStuf's little brother, Cookie, seems to be noticeably sprouting his dorsal fin this year. At 12 years of age, Cookie is just beginning those awkward teenage years....-Katie Jones

Today I had a fantastic encounter with
J pod
, including both new calves -
J50 and J51
! The pod was in resting formation, but
L87 Onyx and J34 Doublestuf
were happily causing a ruckus on the side as the rest of the group 'slept'. We were with the group from Constance Bank, near Trial Island, to Race Rocks. -Marcie Callewaert

Received a call from commercial crab fisherman Guy Lee, reporting
a pod of orcas - 5 adults and 1 calf - about 7 - 10 miles from the harbor at Halfmoon Bay, CA
. The calf was breaching, and they all came close to the boat, and Guy said they saw chunks of what looked like sea lion or some kind of marine mammal meat/blubber floating in the water.

four Grey Whales
. It was Awesome!!! What a Beautiful sight! -Elaine Wrinkle
*
Gray whales off Gedney (Hat) Island, including #49 (Patch) and #723.
The whales were well into the shallows waving their pectoral fins as they dug deep for ghost-shrimp, attracting a dozen or so Pacific Harbor seals to the area and a group of Harbor porpoise. Passengers could not have wished for a better day with sunshine, snow-capped mountains and the best the Pacific Northwest has to offer. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist
