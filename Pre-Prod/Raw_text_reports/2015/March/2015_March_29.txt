Orca Sightings for March 29, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:45pm -
My husband and I spotted
6 transient orcas off the Oregon Coast at Boiler Bay
. They were a half mile from shore. We watched them for an hour and a half during that time we saw them attack and feast on two sea lions. We are volunteers for the Whale Watching Spoken Here Program. Today was the most spectacular whale watching we have ever encountered. The deliberate and calculated behavior of the orcas was phenomenal. In addition to attacking the sea lions we watched them breach, fluke slap, head lung and gracefully surface to breath. There was
1 calf among the 6 orcas
we saw this evening. After we left Boiler Bay we went south to Depoe Bay to see if we could see them going by, we spotted them
just north of Depoe Bay
and watched them swim south and beyond the buoy markers at Depoe Bay. We last saw them going south around

7:30 pm
. I have included some photos in hopes that you will be able to identify some of them. Have a wonderful day! -Kent & Edith Hitchings

We left Langley marina and immediately a Bald Eagle scooped up his fish lunch, right in front of us, what a catch! We headed towards
Gedney/Hat Island
and found our first two whales,
#383 and #22 on the east side
, traveling close to shore. These two stayed together as we caught up with them later in the day, and
#22
gave us a nice close pass-by, what a thrill. Single spouts were seen further east towards Everett, and towards Camano Head, but those whales were on long dives, didn't see enough of their bodies for identification. The weather held, and the sun even came out - another great day aboard Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein (Volunteer Naturalist)

At

16:50
saw a spout (apparently a
gray whale
) heading east 1/4 from
Polnell Point
, heading towards Mariners Cove, just 200' or so off the beach. This is Saratoga Passage and is on the north end of Whidbey Island. -Steve Rothboeck
