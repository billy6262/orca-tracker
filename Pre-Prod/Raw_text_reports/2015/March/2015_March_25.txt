============================================================

Entry 1:
12:00pm - Cook's Casin, s. of Cape Perpetua
(
Cook's Chasm-Northern Oregon Coast-
ALB). While watching grays as a volunteer, "whale watch spoken here" I spotted
7 orcas about 1/2 mile from shore
. There were 2 males in the group and 1 calf with mom. At first they appeared to be tracking a grey and her calf, but then they were in an apparent feeding (maybe fish) we watched them from

12:00 noon to about 20 after
. They were moving north and then west out of our view. -Wayne Starr
