Orca Sightings for March 5, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
T060D
a young male about to belly flop! It was an epic day on the water with mammal-hunting orcas known as Transients. We saw two family groups come together, make a kill, and socialize afterward! The way these orcas communicate, and work together astounds me every time. -Heather McIntyre

We were heading north to
Point No Point
to do some salmon fishing this morning when we sighted
a pod of orcas
coming toward us, just north of and very close to the Point. We watched them from

8:30 AM until
10:00 AM
as they spent time
between PNP and Whidbey Island
. They were in the tide line between us and Double Bluff, then they moved southeast toward Jefferson Head, then returned closer to Point No Point. They ended up heading south again and went out of sight. We could see their spouts in the distance in the bright sun. There were
approximately 10 - 12 orcas
, of many different sizes. There was at least one large adult male. Some of the time they appeared to be feeding, as they were close together and very active. Other times they appeared to be in a more restful state. We saw some spy-hopping and some tail-slapping. It was thrilling to see them for such a long time. Salmon fishing wasn't good (I'd leave, too, if I were a salmon!) We hope the orcas had better success! -Dianne Edmonds (
Through photos, the orcas were identified by Melisa Pinnow & Josh McInnes: T
137's, T037A's (plus T037), T036B's (plus T036)
& Possible
T099
was there too.

Orcas near Point No Point
, Puget Sound. This was Incredible! After a huge freighter went by, several of the orcas lined up and surfed the huge wake. -Stu Davidson

T19, T19B, and T19C in Haro Strait this afternoon
. We were with them from

12:45 til
1:30
and they were milling around
Kelp Reef
.
T18
was also nearby but off on her own. I heard that
later they met up with the T60s and T2B
. -Monika Wieland

5:42pm -
Just saw
two orcas right off of Madrona Beach Camano Island
(Saratoga Passage). They look like they were after something went under a few minutes ago and haven't seen them come back up yet. They're heading south I'm guessing since I haven't seen them come back up. -Wendy Nelson

Until 6pm they were still milling back and forth same general area a bit SE of Pt No Pt
! Then left for a few minutes, returned just at dark and they had made their way up much closer to the point. Connie Bickerton and I watched them surfing and porpoising in a tanker's wake! Total of 9 hours they stayed near Point No Point, 7 of which in a 1/4 mile area SE of the point, feeding and milling. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Got to see the pod from
Pt No Pt this afternoon
! Thanks so much to Alisa for helping to point me and my binoculars in the right direction. They were far off but very active. What a beautiful sight! -Stacey Dufrene Slatton

Just saw the orcas heading NE
south of Point no Point.
Again out in the middle . Maybe heading north but, hard to tell which way they are heading! -Peter Sergeeff

I traveled over to
Pt No Pt
and can see blows, dorsals, lunging, cartwheeling, breaching bodies still east of the point in southbound shipping lanes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
