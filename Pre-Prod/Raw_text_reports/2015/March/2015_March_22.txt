A new photo of Elephant seal pup by Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network volunteer Jill Hein. First included in our
March 21st sightings report. "Amazing news from our Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network - "Ellie" the Elephant seal who has been coming to a south Whidbey beach to rest while molting each spring for the last several years, is back - with a pup! This is the first Elephant seal pup we have ever witnessed in our stranding region (Island, Skagit & N. Snohomish)"
