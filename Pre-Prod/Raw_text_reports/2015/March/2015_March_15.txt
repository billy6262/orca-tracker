-Eckles (ID'd as Transients by Dave Ellifrit/Center for Whale Research)

This is the only photo I received of the
Killer Whales that were off the Mendonoma Coast
...first spotted by Fish Rocks (off of Anchor Bay), and traveling south. I did hear they spent some time near Cook's Beach (off north Gualala). Lots of CA Sea Lions here and of course Gray Whales passing by. Hope this photo helps. It was taken by Tom Eckles - he lives to my south and when I caught a glimpse of the Orcas I called him. -Jeanne Jackson

We caught up with
Big Mama (BCY0324) in northern Haro Strait
today as she traveled first north and then northeast towards Turn Point. Despite the rain we had a lovely day out on the water with one beautiful whale! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

9:45am -
I got a message that
5-6 orcas
were seen south of me off
Gualala CA
and headed south. Turned out they spent some time hanging off Gualala River Beach. Jeanne Jackson did see a couple of the orcas. There was also a report of a mother Gray Whale and calf in this vicinity, too. -Scott Mercer

It was very wet outside, but we found
gray whale #22
(left flank) by
Hat Island (Gedney)
, traveling back and forth feeding along the shallow areas. #22 is one of the two known females who frequent our local waters, so it was a treat to see her. -Jill Hein/Naturalist on Mystic Sea
