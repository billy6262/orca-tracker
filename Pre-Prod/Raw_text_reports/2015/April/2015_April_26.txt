Afternoon trip report - A 25th anniversary fundraising cruise today for Island County Beach Watchers - and what a great day for passengers, and whales! We headed towards Port Susan and immediately found
#22 and #383
foraging along the shoreline with pectoral fins almost waving at us...another blow in the distance and we found
#49 Patch
heading towards
Kayak Point
, traveling with
#21
. Then yet another blow and we found
#53 Little Patch
in the middle of the bay!! Wow, 5 whales! We had time for a short re-visit with #22 and #383 before returning to port, it was so cool to see FIVE whales today, very happy passengers aboard Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Noon
- we had the thrill of watching
two gray whales feeding off our beach at Port Susan Terrace on east Camano Island
. They were inside the buoy line and spent nearly an hour stirring up the bottom for their feast. Two whale watching boats shared the experience with us. This brought some questions to mind. How do the boat crews track the whales? And are there distance limitations for boats and gray whales,as there are with Orcas? We all love our whales. -Mary Pelland
