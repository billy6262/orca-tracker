============================================================

Entry 1:
8:02 pm -
A
small group of whales
just turned up west sound on
Orcas Island
. -Brian Schmitz

So, we are watching the
humpback, Big Mama, just south of Patos Island
. One of the passengers asked about Orcas. I told her that some had been sighted earlier in the morning near here, but no one had seen them since. I also mentioned that they could pop up any time and BOOM! THERE THEY WERE,
Ts
HEADED TOWARD US AND BIG MAMA! Squeals of laughter and delight! We followed the
T36As, T49Bs past Patos Island as they headed toward East Point, Saturna Island, BC
. Pics of mine from aboard the Peregrine, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. -James Mead Maya

6:35 am -
Very active
orcas east of Sucia island
, seen through binoculars out of Echo Bay.
5-12 individuals
although difficult to see as they were staying close together. Traveling slowly northbound. -Jennifer Smith

Today we found
two humpback whales near East Point, Saturna Island
. One of the whales was a large female named
Big Mama
and the other was a younger, smaller animal (later
ID'd as "Windy"
). We watched them zig zag back and forth near the shallows of
Boiling Reef
and I couldn't resist snapping a shot with a humpback tale, the
Patos Island Lighthouse, and Mt. Baker in the background
. It was just too good to pass up. After this happened, the whales surprised us with a closer look. I will say this - It's not every day I have to go home and shower because I have whale snot all over me. And as a side note: humpbacks decidedly do not smell good. -Katie Jones
