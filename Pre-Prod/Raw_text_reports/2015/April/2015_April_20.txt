Orca watchers, here's you latest update on
tagged orca L84
. 20 April update - This past week marked the beginning of the third month of tracking L84. The whales continued to spend time
off the southwest Washington
and
northern Oregon coasts
during this time. As of the morning of the last update (14 April) the whales were approaching the area near the Columbia River. They turned north and by the morning of the 15th were between the entrances to Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay. From there, they turned south and by the morning of the 16th were off Tillamook Head. They then turned north that day and by the morning of the 18th were off the entrance to Grays Harbor, before turning south. On the morning of the 18th they were off Tillamook Bay, where they again turned north and were off the entrance to the Columbia River on the morning of the 19th. By this morning (20th) they were just to north of the entrance to Grays Harbor, but well offshore.

It's proximity to the speeding ferry made perspective easy: it was nearly as big a the vehicles on the car deck. It had a relatively short, somewhat curled dorsal fin, and a perpendicular off-white stripe on its upper side.

Saw this gray whale about

6:00pm about 3 miles south of Elger Bay off of Camano Island
. -Feeding all by itself, watched it for about 30 min. and never saw another whale around. -Andrew Dillon
*
Trip report: The summer-like weather continued, the seas were calm, and we found
two of our gray giants
feeding on the drop-off
between Hat (Gedney) Island and Everett
.
#383
was the first whale we found, and soon
#22
joined him and they traveled together, feeding, and sometimes just logging on the surface. At one point they surfaced in tandem between us and another boat, wow, now that was a surprise, and such a treat to hear their powerful "blows". We scouted further afield looking for more whales but none were found before we needed to head back to Langley. What a great day for many passengers who had never seen whales before!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

For the second evening in a row, about
5 PM, we had a Gray Whale
feeding just below our bluff. The tide was in and the whale was feeding in the shallows, barely breaking the surface. -Barbara Brock
