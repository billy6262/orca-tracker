Orca Sightings for April 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's Killer Whales with a new calf
in the middle! Not sure who the new one belongs to yet! -Traci Walter

Good morning! As if we weren't having enough fun watching those cute little J pod babies...we were able to spend time with a
new transient orca baby
! We had two wonderful encounters with the
T65A's, T65B's, T75Bs, and T75C
as they cruised in amongst the
San Juan Islands
. We were able to view several kills, but the highlight of the day was the new little kiddo in the group - likely belonging to T75B. -Katie Jones

It felt like a summer day on the water this
afternoon
. Weather that would spoil anyone rotten while spending time with a very frisky group of transient orcas near
Lopez Island
. This group included one of my favorite families - the
T65A's
, which consists of a mother and her four kids. The are so much fun to hang out with. When we caught up with the whales, they must have just made a kill because there was all kinds of exuberant behavior like this breach. -Katie Jones
*
Lots of
Transients
, some scenes from encounter with
T65As, T65Bs, T75Bs & T75C
. -James Mead Maya

12:00pm -
John Rogstadt of WA State Ferries called at
noon
to relay a report from the Ferry Sealth as it was east-bound out of
Thatcher Pass, of 3 adult orcas and 1 calf
, in Rosario Strait headed north.
*

12:45 pm -
Can anyone get eyes looking north towards Oak Harbor? I saw a dorsals or a black tail fin at least that's what it appeared to me. -Rachel Haight
*

7:15 pm -
Second evening in a row at the same time we watched
a Gray whale
from Grand Ave. Park in
Everett
, looked to be heading toward Saratoga passage, halfway between Jetty and Hat Islands (maybe a bit closer to Jetty). I just LOVE living here!! -Shelby Hight Fifield
*

7:00 am -
I'm seeing several spouts
between Gedney and Everett
. Much too far away to ID, but at least 2 whales and I think they were Grays. Close together, headed west past the south end of Gedney. -Caleb Thompson
