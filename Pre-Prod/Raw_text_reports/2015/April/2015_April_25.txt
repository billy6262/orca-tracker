Orca Sightings for April 25, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:45 pm -
The magic of midnight on
Port Susan
: Still air, star filled sky, shimmering moonlight on a rippled sea, the silence of midnight broken by the blowing of
a grey whale
, eerily echoing off the bluff, swimming a stone's throw off the beach, headed for kayak point! Three blows and swim, Three blows and swim, fading into the night. -Doug Barlow

Five gray whales in Port Susan this morning
! Blue skies and sunshine soon replaced the early morning rain as Mystic Sea headed through calm water towards heart-shaped blows silhouetted against the skyline. Gray whales
#22, 44 (Dubknuck), 49 (Patch), 53 (Little Patch) and 723
welcomed us as they swam slowly southwards in unison, the only sound breaking the silence being the 'whoosh' of air from their blowholes. How lucky we are to have these gentle giants around Whidbey Island every year... Our afternoon trip to Port Susan brought forth fresh fruit in the form of
#383
, accompanied by a friend (possibly
#21
) feeding close to shore. Returning to Langley we spotted blows off Fox Spit in Saratoga Passage - so that's where Patch and his companions went! -Sandra Pollard

They came right up to the beach at
Kayak Point
this evening around

BCY0324
caudal/peduncle (aka tail) throws. The whale lies upside down, lifts it's aft end high in the air and slams the flukes down. She did this repeatedly. A humpback's peduncle, the area in front of the tail flukes, contains the most powerful muscles in the animal world. Strong enough to get a 60 ton animal airborne with 2-3 kicks of the tail. -James Gresham
