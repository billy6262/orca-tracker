Orca Sightings for April 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We met a
transient pod just outside of Friday Harbor
with the San Juan Excursion boat tour. There was a mama, her son, and her two girls. They came right up to our boat and said hello! We followed them around the area for over an hour. They caught something for lunch and the gulls went crazy. They were very friendly! -Danna Bostwick
*
A headstand right beside Ken's boat (under research permit) in San Juan Channel just to the northwest of Shaw Island! A rather impressive one, at that. This was the
T49A
transient group in the afternoon. -Val Shore
*
It was a great afternoon on the water with the
T49A
family of transient orcas. We spent some of the encounter near
Frost Island
where they appeared to be messing around with the lines on crab pots! This is a behavior I have heard about, but never witnessed until today. I guess if they find something that might be a good toy, they don't hesitate too much. I just hope they are careful about toys like that. We left them for a while to go check out some other wildlife and when we returned to the orca family, they were near the
Shaw Island ferry landing
and appeared to have made a kill. -Katie Jones

Approximately
7 orca
including at least one small were active herding then eating a habror seal in
Wasp Passage
(NW of Shaw Island) around 3pm. Numerous small boats were in the area watching. Just off east tip of Crane Island. Whales headed westward when finished. -Blair Evans

It was so nice to see the
T049As
again and they were having a grand old time chowing down on lunch and then following that up by playing with a crab pot float. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Thanks to Shane of Island Adventures and to the Washington State Ferries for relaying a sighting of
killer whales in Thatcher Pass
we were able to get a look at the T049A's for the 4th time this week. They have scoured every corner of our range since arriving on
April 6th. -Mark Malleson

We were with
4 Orcas off of Blakely

Sunday at 3pm we boarded the Mystic Sea at the Langley Marina for a benefit whale watch hosted by the Langley Main Street Association and Mystic Sea Charters...we launched toward Gedney (Hat) Island, on the lookout for
gray whales
or the rumored orcas in the area. We could never confirm any orca sightings, but just
east of Gedney
we saw the first misty blow of
a Gray whale
, cruising along the dropoff at the edge of the mud plume from the
Snohomish River
, from only 10-20 feet deep to about 600 feet deep. This Gray never fluked but from the dorsal markings we got a tentative ID as
#22
. Then we cruised back toward Gedney and encountered a "mystery" whale, with a mostly unmarked back that didn't resemble any of the grays in the catalog, so this may be a new recruit to the Saratoga grays this year. This one did some great spyhops in the few minutes we were with it, before we saw another whale 1/2 mile to the south that actually breached (or half-breached, which is as much as you can hope for in a gray whale). This one, also never positively identified, did a series of about a half dozen unusual spyhops at a 45 degree angle on its back, which was a fitting finish to the trip. (from other photos, Jill Hein ID'd
#383
as being one of the whales seen on this cruise-ALB). -Susan Berta & Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

4:49 pm - 3 whales!
Look forward to IDs by those on board!

4:30pm -
from
Harborview park, Everett.
..Alisa and Ed are watching 2-3 Gray whales (and The Mystic Sea) just off east side of Hat/Gedney Island. Susan, Howard, Langley Main Street Assoc. and guests are having a beautiful encounter on the fundraising cruise for Orca Network. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

3:36 pm -
Well I've got eyes on
a grey whale
heading south. -Danielle Pennington
*

3:50 pm - Gray whale is right at Possession Point
, south Whidbey.

3:10 pm - from Mukilteo
Ed spotted, and we are seeing, a
Gray whale close to Whidbey Island south of Glendale
heading south towards Possession Point. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
We found
gray whale 22
deep in the
Snohomish delta
on it's side feeding. We could see her from land. We also saw
44 at Sandy Point
feeding on its side. Both whale were showing pecs and tail very far out of the water. This is probably what people are seeing. We never found any killer whales. -Michael Colahan

12:30 pm -
The Langley Whale Center reports gray whale
#44 Dubknuck
just passed by
Langley
about 150 feet from shore. Heading south. Lots of visitors came running when the "Whale bell" was rung.
*

12:25 pm - Two grays
outside
Langley
! Heading south. -Cara Hefflinger
*

11:30 am - Gray in Port Susan
. A lone Gray was seen just off shore in front of
Tulalip Shores
this morning. Fed briefly just off shore. The Gray was heading north and disappeared around the corner toward Tulare. -Vicki Mattson
