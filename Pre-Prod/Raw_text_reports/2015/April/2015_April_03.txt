Hi! On our first visit to San Juan Island, and were lucky enough to be able to watch
a pod of orcas
swimming north- south off the coast alongside
West Side Road
. Only saw two at any one time, but I suspect it was a bigger group than that. Traveling and some playing. -Ros McNamara

J17 Princess Angeline
foraging off Lime Kiln on the west side of San Juan Island this afternoon.
J-Pod
was super spread out as they made their way south through Haro Strait, with most of the whales being on the Canadian side. Seas were rough and dive times were long, so I don't think all whales were documented. That means the mystery of who J52's mother will continue! -Monika Wieland

, echolocation at
12:40.

10:00 am -
was on what we call the
Bandon High Spot
, approx. 43 05. 124 50. It's about 18 mi. west of
Bandon, Oregon
.
Single male
followed right alongside us for 15-20 min. while we were trolling for salmon. Appeared to be all by himself. While he was with us he appeared to be very curious about us. He stayed about 10' from our starboard side for about 15 min. He would dive to a depth of maybe 10 or 20 feet and swim parallel to us for a couple of minutes, then surface and kind of roll on his side a little and stare at us with one big eye. He repeated the same basic maneuver 8 or 10 times before he swam off. We were in a area with a fair amount of feed that had several humpbacks feeding on it and were catching occasional salmon. There were also sea lions in the area, including some very young ones. The salmon we caught were empty so I'm not sure what we were metering but sardines and shrimp were being caught in the general area. -Ken Gossard
