. By
April 5th they had traveled north to
just south of the mouth of Willapa Bay
, where they have remained through this morning (6 April). -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

I CANNOT believe the amazing weather we've had lately as well as the various
Bigg's (transient) Killer Whales
that have been around! Today it was the
T49A's
and the
T123's
. We were
just south of San Juan Island
and followed them til they went around the bottom of Lopez Island. Just a beautiful day. -Traci Walter

Christie Shaffer called from Whidbey Shores, just south of
Fox Spit
on Saratoga Passage, Whidbey Island, to report watching
three gray whales
, feeding close to shore. After 10-15 minutes they moved slowly south.

Entry 2:
T49C
going south in
San Juan Channel with Deer Harbor
in the background. Today we started out with beautiful weather, a full boat, and no whale reports. That changed very quickly as we got word about a potential sighting right in San Juan Channel! Another boat was able to get there and confirm the rumor. Very soon after leaving the dock, we joined up and were able to hang out with
T49C, a lone transient male Killer Whale
. He sometimes hangs out with other groups that move through the area, but is by himself on occasion. We also got down to Whale Rocks area to check out the Steller sea lions, Harbor seals, and Bald Eagles. We then went back up to T49C in time to watch him kill presumably a Harbor seal. Beautiful day out there! -Traci Walter Photography, Western Prince Whale Watching & Wildlife Tours
*
T049C near Shaw Island
in San Juan Channel -James Gresham
*
This afternoon around
2 PM
I saw the
T65As
head north past
Lime Kiln
. They were fairly close to shore doing lots of milling; they may have made a kill right before I got there as they were tightly circling and tail slapping a lot. When they started traveling again, they cruised right past the rocks in front of the lighthouse, taking a moment to harass a Steller sea lion on their way by! From our boat we
met up with them off Snug Harbor at 3 PM
, where they
went into Open Bay
and then continued north along the shoreline of Henry Island. Finally, at

4:30 PM, I saw them once more from shore at Reuben Tarte County Park
- they were just rounding Green Point after having gone
through Spieden Channel
and disappeared behind Spieden from my vantage point. -Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
*
We had a great trip today that was full of excitement! After a long period away, my favorite group of
Transient Orcas, the T065A's
have returned to the Salish Sea. When we met up with the T065A's for the second time they were traveling through
Spieden Channel
where they proceeded to actively forage going down on long dives, and being very sporadic with their movement. We watched as they made a slow pass by Green Point where there were about 50 sea lions in the area. For a mammal that needs to consume about 400-500 lbs a day, a (roughly) 2,000 sea lion would have been a good meal! No one knew what would happen, and we wondered if the one pass we saw would be it. Maybe they decided it wasn't worth the effort to attack? But, that one pass-bye wasn't it! The whales ended up circling back around and made an attempt at the sea lions; unfortunately, it was a failed attempt. What happened after the orcas attempted to separate a sea lion was very interesting- all of the sea lions appeared to band together and chase the orcas off! They were noticeably agitated (as you can imagine), growing loudly, and continued to follow the orcas a short distance seemingly warding them off. I guess there's truth when they say there's power in numbers!! -Heather McIntyre, Naturalist, Legacy Charters
*

07:45 AM - 4 orcas
sighted. 1 male, 2 females and a calf, between
Brooks Point, Pender Island, and Turn Point, Stuart Island
, in Boundary Pass. They were traveling, then turning around and possibly feeding. There were 3 spy hops. At first we thought they were transients, but now not sure. A large ship came by (reason for spy hops?) then the orcas continued on west. Closer to the Canadian side. -Monica Petrie
*
Transients off Port Townsend

Watching
a gray whale
in the middle of
Saratoga Passage between Langley and Fox Spit
. Looks to be heading north. -Becky Wilson
*
They were in the ferry line for Bainbridge so it could be
minke or Dolphins
based on the dorsal fin shape. Wasn't a lot of breaching but definitely feeding was going on...way to small (to be Humpback). Probably a small group of minkes or Dolphins. -Jayce Lemmer
*

4:15pm - Minkes
feeding off of pier 63 in
downtown Seattle
. Definitely 2. The shorter dorsal fin made me think minke. -Caroline Henry
*
Trip report: Headed out with sunny skies and a light wind, getting a few reports of some grays south past the Clinton/Mukilteo Ferry. The wind got stronger, so when reports came in of
two grays (#22 and #56) north of Langley
, Capt. Monte made a quick u-turn to get back into calmer water. We came upon these two and surprisingly, they stayed extremely close together throughout the entire encounter. They were generally heading south, but moving around toward Camano, then toward Langley. Saw some great views of their blow holes, and some very nice fluke up tail dives, allowing the passengers to clearly see the differences in the white pattern on the underside. As we left them, they were headed over to Camano, most likely for some feeding. Another beautiful day on Mystic Sea with great passengers, including some kids who got their very first whale sighting! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.
*
Just north of
Cama Beach State Park, Camano Island
. There are 2 in the photo. Incredible that they are coming back to safe plentiful feeding grounds. -Edward Greybeck
