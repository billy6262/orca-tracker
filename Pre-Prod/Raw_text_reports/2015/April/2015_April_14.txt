Orca Sightings for April 14, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Looks like
J51 is a male
...he was with mom
J41
and
J47 (J19 and J35
were nearby), and there did appear to be some pushing going on. A few times J47 surfaced right with J51 while J41 was a little bit ahead. J47 was breaching a bit as well, it was pretty charming and interesting to see him tagging along with the baby. I'm not sure if this photo is the baby getting a little bump or him skirting out of the water sideways (I think it is the latter as none of the other photos clearly shows another whale under him). -Tasli Shaw

Orca watchers, here's your latest update on the tagged orca
L84
.
14 April update -
The whales have continued to spend time
off the southwest Washington coast
over the past several days. As of the morning of the last update (10 April) the whales were just north of the entrance to Willapa Bay, heading south. They continued south and by the
morning of the 11th were off the Columbia River
. On the morning of the 12th, they were just
south of the Columbia River
, but heading north. The morning of the 13th found them between Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay and on the morning of the 14th they were off the middle of the Long Beach Peninsula heading south, approaching the area near the Columbia River by that evening. -Brad Hanson, NOAA, NWFSC, Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

2:30pm -
We encountered the
TO49A's
at the south
East corner of James Island
. The Orcas were in a very sleepy mode as they
travelled north up Sidney Channel
. They did not travel very far in the time we were with them and had obviously made a kill earlier as we saw a large Stellar Sea Lions swim right past them (lucky Sea Lion. We believe these were the Transient Orcas reportedly heard on the hydro phones earlier in the day but had not been seen until we found them! -Andrew Lees, Manager & Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching

4:30 pm -
...we saw
three Orcas
at the same location heading north. (
between Mukilteo and Clinton
. -Tim Taylor
*

7:40 pm -
Just saw the
Gray Whale
surface again east of the green channel marker north of
Point No Point
. Looked to be heading NE.

6:23 pm -
Just saw the whale fluke up, very close to the Whidbey side. We saw the whale again at

6:30,
6:35 and
6:40
steadily plodding south. It will be fun to see which one shows up off Langley tomorrow. -Susan Berta/ Howard Garrett

6:00 pm -
from
Shore Meadow Road, Mutiny Sands
, Whidbey Island - heart-shaped blow back-lit by the sun
in Admiralty Inlet
followed by the distinctive roll of
a gray whale's back
heading steadily south, hopefully to join the other Puget Sound grays. Will this be a new arrival or a previous visitor we haven't yet seen this year? It's amazing to me that we have the privilege of seeing these behemoths in our local waters taking a little time out on their migration to feast on the ghost-shrimp around our island. Let's hope they all find plenty to eat. -Sandra Pollard
