Orca Sightings for April 17, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:50 am - Transient calls on Lime Kiln Hydrophone
. -Connie Bickerton
*
John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research attached
a suction cup tag on gray whale #22
today. The tag may only last a few hours but can yield dive times and depths, and hopefully some video of pit-feeding, to see how it's done.
*

11:05 am -
Early whale sighting from "Mystic Sea" of
#44 (Dubknuck)
heading in a generally northerly direction, before spotting
#21, #22, #49 (Patch) and #53 (Little Patch)
... Let's hope these huge, gentle creatures pay us a visit tomorrow for Langley's "Welcome the Whales." -Sandra Pollard

11:41 am -
Looks like a
Gray whale in Saratoga Passage between Langley and south end of Camano
. -Becky Wilson

11:20 am -
Eric of Mystic Sea called to report
Gray whale #44 Dubnuck
near Camano Head trending NW towards Baby Island , Fox Spit area.
*
Tiny little transient kiddo,
T75B2, near Flat Top Island
. This teeny squirt may only be a week or two old. -Katie Jones
*
Transient south of Hein Bank
. -Capt. James Mead Maya

John Calambokidis (with Jeff Foster from Cascadia and Dave Cade, Stanford)
deployed a video and dive recording tag on a gray whale (CRC ID 22
) on Friday morning at around
1000
near
Everett
, Washington. The tag was deployed with a long pole and attached to the whale with four small suction cups. The goal of the overall study is to document diving and feeding behavior of whales (video to help confirm feeding) in this region to help evaluate the proportion of their diet by prey and habitat and is being conducted with the support and collaboration of the Washington Department of Natural Resources. We initially found
two gray whales (ID 22 and 49) off Hat Island
and deployed the tag just as they were
joined by another pair (ID 21 and 383)
. The tag was deployed with a very slow approach as the whale was almost stationary and the tag was placed just a few m behind the blowhole. The tag has stayed on all day and into the night so hopefully successfully gathering video and ancillary diving kinematics data including depth, speed, acceleration, and heading but this will not be confirmed until the tag comes off and is recovered because this wealth of data is all stored on the tag. Deployment covered both low and high tide and included close to 50 documented feeding events around the Snohomish Delta, which is far better than we hoped to get on the whole effort (as long we get the tag back and it was functioning OK). Several whale watch boats arrived on the area after the tag deployment and we were able to discuss with them the function of the tag and of the study. We left the whale late in the day as the wind picked up but we could pick up the radio signal of the tag still on the whale late into the night from our hotel. Tomorrow we will look to recover this tag and continue the study.
