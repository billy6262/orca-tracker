Orca Sightings for April 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had an amazing encounter with a group of transients this evening off Henry Island - here's one lunging in pursuit of a Steller sea lion. It was the T65As, T65Bs, and T75Bs. They seemed to "play" with the sea lion for about 30 minutes before continuing north. Baby
T75B2 off Henry Island
- just a week or two old. -Monika Wieland

Wild Whales Vancouver headed to
Hein Bank

T65A's, T65B's and T75B'

T65A5
kept popping up for air with it's full face out of the water before doing a chin flop back into the water. -Ashley Keegan
