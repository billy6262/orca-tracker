Orca Sightings for April 11, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:30pm -
Many who would otherwise be out watching showed such great restraint and remained gathered for the 2nd Southern Resident C.A.L.F. (Community Action Look Forward) workshop to brainstorm on orca and salmon recovery. However at the end of the workshop, reports that members of
J pod was still on the west side
allowed many of us to caravan and eventually catch fleeting glimpses from County Park of blows and dorsals as they rounded the point passed the Center for Whale Research towards Open Bay. Nothing quite like listening to the hydrophone, hearing them, but not being able to see them for nearly 45 minutes despite the frantic efforts of searching... The water was choppy, and just when I was about to give up, I spotted one!... we saw
about 4 pass Lime Kiln heading north
sort of close to shore...They were spread out and very hard to see due to the water, but I was happy nonetheless to spend a little time with the beautiful black and whites! -Rachel Haight
