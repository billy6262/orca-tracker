Orca Sightings for April 22, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's always such a pleasure to get to spend time with
Jpod
...we got to see them around
False Bay on San Juan Island
. Conditions were a bit on the rough side but that never stops the magic when you are with these guys! It was my first chance to get a look at some of our wonderful new babies!!! -Ashley Keegan, Wild Whales Vancouver

One of the
J-pod calves
seen from Island Explorer 4. -Mark Connell

Some highlights from our trip with
J pod offshore of False Bay
. We had everyone except for the
J14's, J22's, J2 and L87
who must have been trailing behind. We spent some quality time with the "Jabies", which is always a treat! -Gary Sutton

J34 and J27
exiting
Middle Channel
(south end of Haro Strait) in the morning. -Mark Malleson

2:00 pm - Three orcas
spotted at Inn of the Sea,
Yellow Point (Ladysmith, BC)
. We had over 20 seals near us and the whales came really close. Traveling maybe stopped for a short while to feed on a seal. They didn't stay long so not sure if they were feeding. There were two large ones and a smaller one. -Karen Green

Greys
are back for a second night of feeding and cleaning. Just off the beach 100 yards.
Mission Beach, Tulalip WA
. -Christopher Klaschik

Gray Whale #22
spy-hops six times at our stern as we drift, engines shut down, in calm waters aboard the Island Explorer 3. -Michael Colahan
