Orca Sightings for December 22, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:25 p.m. - Two humpback whales' blows
popped up in north Puget Sound, possibly
off Lynnwood
. At least two are still there. It must be about time for them to head to Maui or Puerto Vallarta for the winter, but they seem to like it here. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
