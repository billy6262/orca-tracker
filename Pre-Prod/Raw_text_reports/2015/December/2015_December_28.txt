Entry 1:
Nice day!
T010s, from Trial Island to Johnson Reef
! -Capt. Jim Maya
*
Around

12:30 to
1:00 p.m.
- a small pod of
3 transients ( large male and possible 2 females ) were hanging around Trial Island South Oak Bay
... likely hunting the numerous seals/ sealions that hang out there. We watched them for a good half hour before they headed off towards Sidney / Gulf Islands. -Cheryl Thorpe
*
T10B and his mother T10close to Trial Island's
shoreline off Victoria. -Melisa Pinnow
*
T010 & T010C passing by Victoria harbour's Ogden Point
breakwater. -Mark Malleson
*

3:04 p.m. -
They are b
etween Kitsap and the southwest end of Whidbey
. Pretty amazing to watch today. I took this series from Eglon, that is Possession Point at the southeast end of Whidbey in the background, but the whale and boat were much closer to Scatchet head at the southwest end of Whidbey.

2:00 p.m. -
I am at Eglo
n
. They are north, line of sight between Eglon and Scatchet Head on Whidbey. 2 or 3 not really sure, but 3 earlier.

1:30 p.m. -
Still watching them, northbound
north of Eglon
, closely following the current line.

12:57 p.m. -
Just found
3 humpbacks a bit south of Eglon
, heading south mid-channel, but may be circling and feeding. Visible without binoculars. Strangest sight of the day so far was a pod (?) of sea lions, at least a dozen animals, possibly twice that number or more.-Connie Bickerton
*

2:30 p.m. -
watching
several humpbacks
from our "Big Eye" scope - they appear to be about due
east of Point No Point
... spouting, fluking, and one was just waving its peduncle and flukes around in the air before it dove! Still heading north - so wonderful to have them still hanging around! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

1:45 p.m. -
Seeing
two humpbacks
, blows and arched backs, probably east of Eglon, moving east. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

12:27 p.m -
they appear to be moving more north .. Probably
1/8-1/4 mile north east of boat launch
.

12:21 p.m. -
These whales appear to be just offshore
east of Eglon boat launch
. Viewing still from North Edmonds.

9:43 a.m. - if anybody else is looking for these whales - just re-spotted
north side of Eglon
.

7:53 a.m. - blows from several whales (likely
humpbacks
) between
Rose Point and Eglon
(Kitsap side). As viewed from North Edmonds. -Stu Davidson
