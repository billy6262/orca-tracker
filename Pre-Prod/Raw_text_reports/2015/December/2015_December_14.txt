Entry 1:
The last whales I saw right around

4:15 looked like it was the J16s still southbound
, with long down times.

Seeing foraging whales still southbound from
Shore Meadows
. (south of Bush Point, Whidbey Island). -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

closer to Whidbey side heading south.

When I first spotted
J pod at Ebey's Landing
, they were pushing SW away from me, so I made the decision to hop the ferry over to Port Townsend. As soon
as I arrived to Fort Worden, I spotted whales just a 100 yards offshore or so. J27
was a little further out traveling with little brother
J39
. The group closer to me included
J51
. Time constraints forced me to take the
12:30 ferry home. As slow as the whales were moving, I was hopeful I might see them on the ferry. Halfway through the ride, still hadn't spotted a thing. Then, dead ahead was
J34
traveling with his mom
J22
. After they passed by, I figured that was it. Then, a group with a small calf (
J17s
) popped up right next to the ferry and the captain cut the engines. It appeared a couple of the whales corralled and maneuvered the baby away from the ferry. This happened as the whales entered the sun glare and I wasn't able to get the best pictures. But, one of my last sights as the whales were behind us, was seeing
J28
traveling with an itty bitty fin presumably
J54
, my first time seeing him/her! All in all, it was a much needed day spent in some much needed sunshine with many J pod whales. And HUGE thanks to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for helping me sort out IDs!

1:11 p.m. -
They're definitely spread out and the groups I was watching at
Ft Worden
were actually the trailers. Spotted other blows much further south of ferry lanes while we had a group right next to the ferry, and they looked like the whales I had been watching at Ft Worden. Definitely over a dozen.

1:02 p.m. -
They just crossed the
Port Townsend ferry lanes
. A group with a baby popped up right next to the ferry!

11:46 a.m. -
They are currently going very slowly. I have to catch the 1230 ferry back, I'll be watching for them on there too. But at this rate they may not make Point No Point before dark, but they could pick up the pace, who knows!

11:36 a.m. -
They just came up off
Fort Worden
. Slowly southbound. Positive ID on
J27
. One group is on Jefferson County side, I saw some further out mid channel.

9:55 a.m. -
they had pushed more west of me but were still south bound. They were
north of Pt. Wilson
. My only shot at a better view is to get lucky on the ferry, will update again in a bit.

9:30 a.m. -
just spotted them thanks to the Clipper.
North of Ebeys landing
still southbound. -Rachel Haight
*
I can hear very faint
calls between

12:15 -
12:30
. -Kim Merriman
*

11:57 a.m. -
just started hearing them on
Port Townsend hydrophone
. -Connie Bickerton
*

8:30 a.m. - about a dozen Orcas in 3 tight groups
(looks like 2 have babies) heading south near
Fort Ebey Park
in no particular hurry on Whidbey side. They hung out tail slapping, breaching for about 15 minutes before continuing. -Wendy Shimada
*
Juan de Fuca Strait - Sweet double fluke!
BCY0160 and calf near Race Rocks
. -Mark Malleson
*

1:15 p.m. - Puget Sound -
As we wait in Eglon for the orcas, there are
2 humpbacks breaching like crazy
just west of the southbound shipping lane - they breached repeatedly as 2 freighters passed by. -Rebecca French Gerke
