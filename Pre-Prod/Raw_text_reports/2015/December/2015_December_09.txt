Orca Sightings for December 9, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:35 p.m. - central Puget Sound - Juvenile humpback whale
sighting. Feeding
between Vashon Head and Southworth
. -John Rogstad, WSF
*

3:57 p.m. - north central Puget Sound
- took a quick look and found the blows real close to Kitsap side. Between Rose Point and Elgon.

1:22 p.m. - confirmed multiple whales
by simultaneous blows - still due west of north Edmonds, still mid channel.

12:59 p.m. -
must be in a feeding pattern - turned and more northerly now. Still mid channel
due west of north Edmonds
. Stays on surface for several blows then rolls into a dive. Weird that the fluke doesn't come up on any dives I've seen.

12:17 p.m. -
blows spotted mid channel - line of sight between north Edmonds and Just north of Rose Point (
north of Kingston
). At least one maybe a couple. Slowly heading south. -Stu Davidson

10:50 a.m. -
Just at least
one, possibly two, humpback blows
mid channel between Point No Point and Edmonds, nicely backlit by the morning sun. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
