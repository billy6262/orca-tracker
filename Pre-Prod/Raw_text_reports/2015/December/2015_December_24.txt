Orca Sightings for December 24, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
U39 patrolling the Juan de Fuca Strait
. -Mark Malleson

4:00 p.m. - One small orca
traveling very close to shore. The orca was seen by itself in
Malaspina Strait about 5 miles south of Powell River
. I spotted it from shore and watched it for about 5 minutes. I would say it was not a calf. Guessing it was about 12 feet long and it's dorsal fin to be about 12 inches tall. I saw no other white markings on it's body when it came up for air. It was in traveling mode for sure and looked to be in no distress. -Dan Robinson
