Orca Sightings for December 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30 a.m. -
We just observed t
wo humpbacks between Kingston and Point No Point
from the Kingston/Edmonds ferry. -Robert Woeck
*

9:30 a.m. - three humpbacks breaching multiple times off of Eglon
, a bit north of where Stu last reported seeing them. -Sherman Page
*

11:19 a.m. - checked again just now, blows still in same general area
.

8:34 a.m. - definitely humpbacks, at least three maybe four?
Just saw a fluke on a dive. Must be in a feeding pattern as now they are slightly more north than last viewing.

8:26 a.m. - group slowly moving south
- behavior appears to be more like humpbacks with large surface blows then dives of several minutes.
*
viewing from North Edmonds >
8:14 a.m. - many blows from several whales in the Rose Point area (south of Elgon north of Kingston) near Kitsap side. I'm guessing humpbacks (again, several at least), but frequency of blows looks more like Orcas. -Stu Davidson
