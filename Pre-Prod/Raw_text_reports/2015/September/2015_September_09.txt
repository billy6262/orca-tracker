Entry 1:
8:10 p.m. -
Lovely sunset as always at
Lime Kiln
tonight- was greeted by
4-5 orcas
passing by the lighthouse. It was so quiet there tonight - very few people - I loved the fact that I knew the whales were close by because I could hear them "blowing". -Cindy Jackson

My 6th encounter with this family (
T65As
) this year, and as Sara said, it was a charm. This family group is so much fun to hang out with. Today they were wandering south along
Lummi Island
before heading over to do some serious hunting along the shores of Orcas Island. This family of whales is very curious of boats and people, and they came in to check us out several times. -Connie Bickerton
*
EPIC. That was the day we had on the water with the
T65As, T65A, T65A5, T65A4, T65A2, and T65A3
today. We found them up near
Lummi Island
and they were in a playful mood the whole time we were with them----well, playful and hungry! It sure wasn't a great day to be a harbor seal. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Today was a pretty epic day with the
T065As
. They came close to the boat by THEIR choice. They breached, jumped, and tail lobbed. We watched as they caught an unfortunate seal who became their meal. When they were swimming in the shallows, you could even see their jet black bodies underneath the surface and it was breathtaking. They are definitely one of my favorite family groups by far, and they like to have fun and are such a delight to watch. Such a beautiful amazing day on the water spent with friends, couldn't have asked for better. -Rachel Haight

Just a quick update on the Satellite Tagging Research on Alaska Killer Whales : The sat tag we placed on
T100C
is still working and providing valuable information. The
T100s
spent a considerable amount of time in
lower Puget Sound
- as far south as
Olympia
. As they headed north they spent some time around Whidbey Island and then north through Admiralty Inlet. They headed north along the east side of Vancouver Island - transiting
into the Strait of Georgia

6:45 p.m. -
We had a whale report from Brian M, who was on the ferry from Sidney when he saw a very tall, straight blow. He said it was almost as tall as a sailboat mast, off
Spieden Island, between Green Point and Limestone Point
. He didn't see the whale however. (several humpbacks have been frequenting this general area this week-ALB)
*

6:40 p.m. -
Watching
humpback at Limestone Point
. -Barbara Bender
*

4:10 p.m. -
Was just on the water with the
humpback at the mouth of Gig Harbor
. Looks like a young whale. He was hugging the shore to the North of the harbor and continued south toward the Narrows. Sorry about the terrible picture but it was the best I could do with my phone at the appropriate distance. The sailboat wasn't playing nice and used it's motor to position itself in the whale's path. -Amy Bliss-Miller
*

11:45 a.m. -
Saw a
humpback
or humpbacks breaching completely out of the water at
Apple Tree Cove Point
. (Kingston, Kitsap County). -David Luxton
*

11:23 a.m. - Humpbacks and dolphins(?)
slowly heading southward now, seemingly toward
Narrows
.

10:52 a.m. -
A little more between sunrise and north sunrise at this time. Several respectful boats that were here before my first sighting in the area.

10:28 a.m. - Humpback off Sunrise Beach, Gig Harbor.
-Courtney A Turk
*

6:45 a.m. -
I heard the
humpback in Spieden Channel
. It was way out there but we saw a few blows, no fluke, and a beautiful sunrise with the crescent moon. It was heading west then turned back, now heading east. -Peggy Mauro
*
Mary Pacher of Greenbank called on a report of
two whales in Saratoga Passage
just north of Hidden Beach at

9:20 am
. They were fairly close to shore - first she thought they were orcas then thought they might be grays as they were so close to shore.
