Orca Sightings for September 8, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We caught up to the
T65As
today and found an extra whale traveling with them. Big thanks to Gary for figuring out who the extra fin belonged to! Here's a photo of that tagalong,
T49A2, and T65A3
cruising along the
Moresby Island
shoreline. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

We got to spend time today with the
T65A's
up in Canada. We found them near
Mandarte Island
, and followed them to just northwest of
Moresby Island
. I've seen this family group at least 5 times this year, 3 times from boats, and twice from shore in Puget Sound. They have definitely become favorites because of their close family bonds. -Connie Bickerton

A humpback whale
was observed swimming off of
Point Richmond (near Gig Harbor)
at about
10AM
this morning. The whale was
accompanied by 2-3 porpoise??
(
probably a couple of Pacific white-sided dolphins seen in the area for over a year-ALB
). The porpoise were playful, jumping out of the water swimming around buoys, all the time staying near the humpback whale. The whale came with 40' feet of shore at one point surfacing inside one of the boats moored on a buoy. Sorry couldn't catch the porpoise on camera, must have been camera shy! -Joyce Winge

From

5:30-
6:30 PM
this evening we had
two humpback whales near Spieden Island
. We encountered the first one milling off the north side of the Island. The second one was in the middle of Spieden Channel north of Pearl Island. By the time we left, both animals were visible west of Battleship. -Monika Wieland
