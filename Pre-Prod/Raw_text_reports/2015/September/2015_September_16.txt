Orca Sightings for September 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:55 p.m. -
Watching
a humpback about 200 yards off the beach at Point No Point
, Hansville for the past hour or so. Most exciting was when it came in close enough that we heard it blow. Many people fishing, enjoying it too. -Marilyn DeRoy
*

6:45 p.m. -
Now out at
Point No Point
, Hansville- humpback mid channel
between here and Double Bluff
- lots of blows surfacing and tail flukes. Just blew again - herring must be right there as it's staying put for 10-15 minutes. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
*
In sum, I watched the
humpback
for about 30 minutes. It traveled north
from Eglon area to Point No Point
. Most of the time it was mid channel but it went very
close to Double Bluff
before coming back to mid-channel, where it milled about, back and forth. Another great day to see cetaceans in Puget Sound! -Donna Green Van Renselaar
