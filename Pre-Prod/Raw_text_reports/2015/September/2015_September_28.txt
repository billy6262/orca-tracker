============================================================

Entry 1:
Tonights beautiful encounter with the
J14 and L4 matrilines
. We watched the two groups join up
in Haro Strait
and form one huge 'cuddle puddle'. It was great to see the youngsters socializing together too! Towards the end, we even got to see
L95 and J27
chasing each other at high speeds - so cool! -Heather MacIntyre

There's a

*

11:15 a.m. - central Puget Sound
- Jeff Hogan sees
two humpbacks about 1.5 miles north of Alki Point
, almost in the Bainbridge to Seattle ferry lane. Lots of flipper-slapping going on.
*

11:12 a.m. - central Puget Sound -
have been seeing blows and breaches way across the sound from
Alki
, north of Winslow. Looks like
humpbacks
, not orcas. Very stiff and cold wind, hard to see. But beautiful! -Trileigh Tucker
*

10:59 a.m. -central Puget Sound
- They were a ways off and the waters pretty rough. I saw simultaneous blows as well. The one who was breaching appeared to be slightly smaller, but again I was a ways off. They've gotten slightly further out of my sight slowly trending north. Big splashes off and on. A couple were not far from the ferry as it passed, so hoping someone on there might send an update.

10:30 a.m. - It's a breaching humpback!
Just saw a huge splash.
North of Alki
. There's two of them, one looks smaller...Lots of breaching again! Milling in the same area
10:36. Blows visible without binoculars north of Alki beach. -Rachel Haight
*

10:00 .a.m. - central Puget Sound -
Maia at WA State Ferries relayed a report of an undetermined number of orcas (later ID'd as
humpbacks
by several people -ALB)
off Alki Point,
possibly southbound.
*
Central Puget Sound -
I saw them from the

9:40 ferry from Bainbridge
this morning: awesome athletics! Just finished a mtg in west Seattle so I figured I'd come down and take a look but I'm not seeing anything from the lighthouse. -Lisa Sibbett
*

8:27 a.m. - north Puget Sound -
They are north of me now and I would say they are the west side of the mid channel buoy.

8:10 a.m. - The two humpbacks
are out front again this morning. We live on
President Point/Kingston
and they seem to be steadily heading north. -Chris Otterson
