Orca Sightings for September 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sometimes an encounter can become quite special in the blink of an eye. We were out hanging with some orcas, when we approached a small group. It became very apparent that this particular orca had a tiny, blip of a shadow. Turns out I got to meet
L122, the new L Pod baby with Mom, L91
. I don't like going out of my way to find a new calf, I am just happy knowing they are out there and I thought I would see it when I would see it. Little did I know it would be today. -Traci Walter

Today, we first came across a
humpback
who was nice enough to cartwheel, then we moved on to a visit with members with J pod. It was an incredible special to see
J51 Nova
be very playful with lots of spyhops and breaches, traveling alongside his mother
J41 Eclipse
and grandmother
J19 Shachi, J28 Polaris and J17.
We had a nice close passby with
J34 Doublestuf
as well. Baby orcas are the cutest!

2:30 p.m. - The humpback whale at Point No Point,
Hansville. -Becky Newell Woodworth

I'm confident that I witnessed
2 Humpbacks
blowing and slapping tails elsewhere. They were about halfway between
Points Monroe and Jefferson
, seen from Fay Bainbridge. There was a crowd of visiting school children watching and shouting with each splash, but the whales were just too far away for anyone to make a positive ID. After an hour or so-between about
1-2 PM
-most watchers gave up. The shared assumption was Orcas, but now I'm convinced that they were
Humpbacks
, mostly because the slashes were large but no one really ever saw a breaching body. There were also sailboats in the general vicinity, but none too close. -James Hill
*

12:41 a.m. - Dolphins and Humpback
very active outside
Gig Harbor!

One closest to shore seems to be trending north. But very slowly. Doing down for long dives
