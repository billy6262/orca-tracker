Orca Sightings for September 29, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spent all day with the
majority of the southern residents in the Strait of Georgia
. Sunset trip with the staff was the highlight though! Awesome trip! Big mixed groups of
J's, K's and L's
including the newest one,
L122
. The vocals were insane! especially at sunset....it was a pretty surreal setting sitting at sand heads at sunset with whales everywhere squawking away, man, are we lucky to have the opportunity to do this every day. -Gary Sutton

L41 Mega
this afternoon off
San Juan Island

What a great day on the Chilkat! Captain Trifecta took us to Port Townsend, then we found the

, stopped by whale rocks on the way to
Hannah Heights where we found L Pod Resident orcas
, and on the way back we found
two humpbacks whales
