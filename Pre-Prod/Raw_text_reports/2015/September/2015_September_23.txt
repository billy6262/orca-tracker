December 2014. Here is said bundle of joy,
L122
, swimming next to new mom, Muncher (

One, possibly two humpbacks
feeding actively, viewed from

5:15 pm to
7:45 pm
. surface activity and shallow dives, surfacing every 3 -5 minutes with longer breaks when moving onto another feeding area. The whale had reddish-orange coloration on its back fin, quite hooked shape, never saw tail or pectoral fins. appeared quite large when seen close to a watching boat. at one point possibly two whales given length of distance between blows that were only seconds apart, but not sure. We saw the
humpback in Rosario Strait:
east of Obstruction Pass (south-east side of Orcas Island), traveling north to
Buck Bay (east side of Orcas Island)
, swimming within a half mile of the east shore of Orcas Island, then circling back (further east, approximately in the shipping channel) and swimming south to Obstruction Pass, then going north again to Buck Bay and turning south again, but this time staying close to the east shore of Orcas Island. Then it got too dark to see. We saw it the late afternoon and evening of Sept 22, and then again the afternoon of Sept 23 also for several hours, repeating its cruising up and down the shore feeding, then at about
4:30 pm the whale kept going north of Doe Bay and we did not see it again. -Amy Mower
