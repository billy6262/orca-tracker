A wonderful day on the water including a rare sighting of a
Fin Whale
! The day started off with a report of Transient orcas near Whidbey but they were sneaky T's and we never found them. A few minutes later we found a whale, it looked quite beat up with a weird fin, no fluke, turns out we may have been one of two boats that saw it today, sounds like it may be a young Fin Whale!!...next we found L41 Mega, he was supposedly with a few other L's but was by himself when we found him. We spent some quality time with
Mega
then found a
Minke whale
on our way to
Protection Island
