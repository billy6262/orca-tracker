Many people gathered at

to watch the eclipse, and just as the moon began to be visible, the humpback came by! It was close to the beach when first spotted, then moved on to the west. -Marilyn DeRoy

Hello I don't see any reports from yesterday on the website, but hopefully someone with knowledge and experience saw the whale we saw off of
West Beach in West Seattle
. The whale was surfacing and blowing as we stepped out of our car at the condos there at West Beach (south of Brace Point), and I only had a glimpse of its back so I'm not sure which kind of whale it was. I'm pretty sure it had a fin on its back, and it was really a large creature - and very close to shore, maybe 100 yards or even less. The whale seemed to be alone and was headed north. It continued to blow occasionally, but unfortunately it did not surface for another look to see what kind it was. I hope this is helpful. -Ellen Cole (no positive ID but the description fits and there have been several reports of humpbacks in the general area of Alki, Vashon, Blake Island- ALB)

from upper terrace of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline watched
