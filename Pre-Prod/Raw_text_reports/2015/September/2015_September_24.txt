Orca Sightings for September 24, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we traveled 2 hours (well worth the wait) before our first sighting of whales. We found
transients (near Hannah Heights)
moving quickly south along San Juan Island.
J & K pod were southbound not far behind!
We had both residents and transients in the same area! We continued northbound, and suddenly, we saw
Dall's porpoises
rocketing across the water. Some of the residents turned to play with them, and then the porpoise headed our way, bowriding for a few seconds. It was amazing! We turned back south visiting with residents before returning to the transients, ID'd as the
T049As (T049A2 not present). T049A1
snagged a harbor seal and the family proceeded to breach and spyhop after the kill. As we headed home, we came across
two humpbacks
. We stayed with one for awhile trying to get an ID shot on the fluke, but he'd never show his tail. As we were about to leave, he suddenly started pec slapping for about 10 minutes. He approached the boat (we'd been totally stationary at this point) doing his backstroke and you could see his whole body under the water. He even cartwheeled once and trumpeted twice! What a day! -Rachel Haight

We had a whale sighting at

10:30 PM.
We are a mile
south of the Southworth ferry on the Kitsap side of Colvos Passage
. It was dark, but it was probably a
humpback
, definitely not an orca...no dorsal fin ! Guessing it to be 18-20 feet in length, very close to shore and doing lots of shallow dives as it headed steadily northbound. -Noreen Ferris
*

4:41 p.m. - humpback
blows slightly south east from
Point No Point
. few miles off shore on Kitsap side - I guess slightly east of shipping lane. Trying now to determine direction. Appears to be in a feeding pattern. -Stu Davidson

....As we headed home, we came across
two humpbacks

Iceberg Point, Lopez Island
) We stayed with one for awhile trying to get an ID shot on the fluke, but he'd never show his tail. As we were about to leave, he suddenly started pec slapping for about 10 minutes.

4:05 p.m. - Yeah! Humpbacks!
Have been seeing humpbacks off
south Lopez Island
the past few days (spouts, dorsals, breach). Now there is one amongst a huge gathering of seagulls doing pectoral splash after pectoral splash to the south of
Iceberg Point
area. -Sally Reeve.
