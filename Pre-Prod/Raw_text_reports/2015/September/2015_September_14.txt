I've attached a photo I took of
J50
breaching from the Island Explorer 3 near
Hein Bank
.
J50 and J52
were swimming together by themselves and playing the whole time during our visit with them! They breached, tailslapped, lunged around, spyhopped, and seemed to have a fantastic time with each other. At one point they also did a double spyhop! Eventually J36 swam in and joined them, but it didn't stop the the little duo from playing one bit! It's hard not to have a big smile on your face when you see these little calves having such a good time together - seemingly without a care in the world. It feels like lots of hope looking forward with so many new calves! -Bart Rulon
