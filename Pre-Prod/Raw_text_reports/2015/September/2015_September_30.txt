Orca Sightings for September 30, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
L122 is a boy!
Oh Boy! They came through
President's Channel
which was a first for me! We were skunked on All Aboard Sailing in the morning by fog. But then, after hanging with a humpback, meeting up at sunset with the
Js, Ks and Ls south of Flattop
was just... incredible. More breaches than I've ever seen... and
L91
rolled around her calf
L122
, less than a month old, to reveal he is a boy. (we await official confirmation from the Center for Whale Research) -Barbara Bender

Tonight was one of those night's that we dream about out here ... Let me paint the picture for you in words:
forty plus resident orcas traveling up the Orcas Island coastline
, socializing, breaching, syphoping, cartwheeling, and surfacing in respiratory synchronicity in the late afternoon sun. Backlit blows, water that was like glass, my best friend on board, and the sound of their exhalations carrying on for miles like the harmonic sound of water dripping on pebbles. There's nothing that get's me quite like the "koof, koof, koof" of a pod of orca surfacing all at the same time, displaying ties of social familiarity and family unity. They're so close to one another - neurologically programed to take care of each other with an innate sense of family that exceeds our human ties. To them, this social and tactile behavior that we're fortunate enough to witness is vital for their survival. It's an incredibly powerful thing. Humans could learn so much from these black and white mystics. I will stop at nothing to protect these orcas and try to bring back their primary food source, Chinook/King salmon so that our lives will continue to be enriched by their presence. We need to do our part so that they're around for generations to come. -Heather MacIntyre
