10:25 a.m. -
Just spotted the
humpback going past the mouth of Gig Harbor
. Already out of sight headed up Colvos. Watched the dolphin do 6 leaps in a row. Amazing! -Heidi Powers Armstrong
*

10:07 a.m - Humpback heading north in Narrows now towards Gig Harbor
. His buddy, the rogue Pacific white-sided dolphin is with him. Asher Beckett

We watched for about a half hour.
Humpback
seemed to be feeding in the same general area off the east side of
Point No Point
. With the tide going out, it stayed pretty far out there, but we had a good view of several blows at a time, followed by the fluke and the deep dive. -James DeRoy

9:00 a.m. -
Marilyn DeRoy sees that
humpback
again this morning, about
300 yards off Point No Point
, no direction of travel.
*
We watched it until dark on the 17th (
almost
8:00
), just making out the blows. Even though it was out pretty far (
Pt No Pt
, east of the lighthouse in the boat traffic), we could hear the blows. Generally, in the days we've been watching it, it seems to do 3 or 4 blows at short intervals, then show its fluke for a deep dive before it appears again several minutes later. -Marilyn & James DeRoy
*

1:00 p.m. - Humpback
feeding in
Colvos Passage
1.2 N of
Gig Hbr
entrance @ 1300 on 9/16/2015. Accompanied by a very playful acrobatic dolphin. If this was not outside their range we would ID as. spinner Dolphin. Could have been a Pacific White sided, but was not a harbor porpoise. -John Oliveira
*

11:17 a.m. - Humpback and dolphins
close to
Gig Harbor
shores just north or the mouth of the harbor. Should be good viewing from the lookout by old ferry landing and from 5-mile and Point Defiance. -Michel Riley Campbell
*

10:25 a.m. -
I don't know if this is the same one that was off of
Point No Point
, but I just saw a
humpback
1-2 miles off of Edmonds...heading south. When I saw it from Edmonds Bowl, it was in line with PNP. -Sherman Page
