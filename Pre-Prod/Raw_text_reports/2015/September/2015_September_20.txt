============================================================

Entry 1:

. -Capt. Jim Maya

We saw SO MANY whales today! I can't recall the last time I saw this many of them so close together. They were traveling for sure, but there was also a lot of social behavior as well as what looked like a resting line at times. Here is a sampling of groupings we saw between
J's and K's, possibly L's
. An interesting mix. Its gonna take a while for me to figure out who all was there! But we had a few guest appearances along with the usual suspects. And, of course, the J16's were, for the most part, dancing to their own tune away from the rest. -Renee Beitzel

Found and am watching
at least 2 humpbacks off Richmond Beach

watched the humpback from
Point No Point
in front of the lighthouse, trending south. -Michelle Goll

3:40 p.m. -
The
humpback
is still there ...the white caps and wind make it difficult to see the blows and whale.

3:10 p.m. -
I saw several blows and finally a
humpback
back and tail before its dive,
3-5 miles NW of Edmonds
, which probably puts it a bit south of the line with Point No Point and Possession Point. -Sherman Page

3:42 p.m. -
Just saw him/her again. Mid channel, headed towards
PnP/ Useless Bay
. Laura Finch

3:06 p.m. -
We just saw some blows
between Point No Point and I think what would be Possession Point
... Anyone else see anything? They were pretty large, thinking possibly the
humpback
... We're still trying to spot again. I'll post if we see anything else. -Laura Finch
*
I arrived at
Point No Point
today @

3:00
spotted a
Humpback
just
South of Possession Point
. We continued to watch for hours, over & over , many times we saw the Humpback surface, 1-4 blows and then take a big dive with the fluke way up in the air... This whale headed North towards the yellow buoy, directly across from Pont No Point. and continued milling further North just South of Double Bluff. Turning back around in the area , going away from PNP and then coming back for a closer look, keeping perimeters south of Double Bluff then treading south of the yellow buoy , towards Possession Point. I left @
6:30 last sighting was just south of the yellow buoy closer to Possession Point. Days like this makes my heart happy, and a reminder to buy a powerful lens/camera. -Kathe Bradley

Via my dad, Robert... He saw
about a dozen whales
from
Breaker's Point, Cannon Beach, Oregon
today. He said he saw many spouts and spurts of breaching from this morning around
10 am until the afternoon
. The whales didn't appear to be traveling in any direction. They were off the surf zone clearly visible from shore. When they breached he saw long white pecs and he
thinks they were humpbacks
