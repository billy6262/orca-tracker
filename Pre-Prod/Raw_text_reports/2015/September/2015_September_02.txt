Orca Sightings for September 2, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales at any time of the year are a gift, September whales especially so as sightings become a little less regular. Magnificent
Mega (L41), Matia (L77)
and other L pod members milled and foraged
near Salmon Bank off the west side of San Juan Island
today. Although initially fairly well spread out, the whales appeared to be grouping up as Mystic Sea left. Our visiting Steller sea-lions, always an impressive sight, were hauled out on Whale Rocks enjoying the afternoon sunshine before the rain. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist
*

4:50 p.m. - Orcas on west Whidbey (south of Bush Point, Admiralty Inlet)
slowly moving north, as if feeding. 4 females, one male. No spectacular behavior, just surfacing and slow dives. Adams Road earliest we've ever seen them go by. -Christina Baldwin
*

2:45 p.m. - saw blows just outside Cultus Bay
so at least some appear to be coming around
south end of Whidbey
.

2:10 p.m.
- From Stamm Overlook in
Edmonds
they (at least some) were breaching about 1-1.5 miles south of Scatchet Head, south Whidbey. Due to distance and sea chop no direction discernible.

1:45 p.m. -
They (or at least some) did not choose Admiralty...they are keeping a line
northward towards south Whidbey
.

1:35 p.m. -
most of pod (
10-12, with 3 large males
) has grouped up into two groups with some separation, large male leading and ahead of both groups. They appear to have kept a line which has moved them off shore...they are northbound in southbound shipping lanes. Appear to be angling Admiralty but not certain at this time.

12:58 p.m. -
From Sunset Ave in Edmonds, pod is
northbound, north side of Apple Tree Point Kingston on Kitsap side
, a bit spread out, with a couple closer to shore.

12:30 p.m. -
From earlier reports hear that
pod
has flipped and is
now northbound
. From Richmond Beach, pod just passed out
from Kingston ferry dock northbound
at a steady pace. -Alisa, ON
*

1:23 p.m . -
Received a phone report from Washington State Ferries of
a couple of orcas hanging around off Alki
. (It appears some continued south or this is another group entirely-ALB)
*

12:55 p.m. -
The ferry captain spotted a pod of
5-6 orcas heading north
between
Edmonds and Kingston
. -Ignacio Cabezudo
*

11:30 a.m. -
Just got a report the
T's are now back up at Faye Bainbridge
. Lots of action. -Susan Marie Andersson (At least some flipped somewhere around Rolling Bay and are now northbound)
*

11:00 a.m. - T's
have moved back west and are right off
Rolling Bay, Bainbridge Island
.

10:30am.
(from South Beach, B.I.) Seeing them off the point at
Discovery Park
. Heading up to watch from Rolling Bay again. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn
*

10:05 a.m. -
I just caught a glimpse of them from
lower Queen Anne
(with binocs) surfacing right around the orange buoy. From here it looks like the buoy is just
south of Rockaway
, but I could be wrong on that. Saw them surface once and they've been back down for the last five minutes or so. -Katie Kirking
*

9:15 a.m. -
Watching from
Rolling Bay on Bainbridge and see 6-7 fins
, long dives, still trending south, mid channel. South of 2nd marker. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn
*

8:09 a.m. -
Pod just came into view from
Skiff Point, Bainbridge Island
(from the bluff on the north side) looks like the Victoria Clipper stopped to watch, still southbound. -Lynn Batson
*

8:35 a.m. -
Clipper has left. They were doing 6 plus minutes dives in a resting mode. Edging into the southbound traffic lane.

8:07 a.m. -
Abeam
Point Monroe moving south
at 6 kts. -Jason Mihok
*

8:30 a.m. - Rolling Bay, Bainbridge
slowly southbound.

8:05 a.m. -
From a Richmond Beach, I just spotted a lot of fins southbound out from
Faye Bainbridge
park, west of mid channel. -Alisa, ON
*

7:15 a.m. -
My sweetheart on the
ferry out of Kingston
says they saw
orcas
just now.
Southbound
toward Jefferson Beach. -Doug Hayman
*
I spotted what is likely an
old and sickly fin whale at north Hein Bank
. It was seen and photographed again on
September 3rd near McArthur Bank by Island Explorer III of Island Adventure Cruises. -Mark Malleson
