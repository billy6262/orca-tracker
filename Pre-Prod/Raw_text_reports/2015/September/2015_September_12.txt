Orca Sightings for September 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
This is a couple of days late but I wanted to share since the encounter was with the
L-54's
. It was my first time to see them and they are somewhat rare to encounter. On board The Legacy, we started out on the
west side of San Juan Island at Kanaka Bay
where the
J-17's
were foraging close to shore. I guess my path is destined to cross with this group as I have seen matriarch Princess Angeline and family three out of the last three trips. Due to the number of whale watch, commercial fishing and pleasure boats, we didn't stay long and departed for Hein Bank. There we found the L-54's in an absolutely beautiful setting with calm seas, blue skies and a Mt Baker which is just a tad whiter these days. It was extra special to watch orphaned and adopted Wave Walker take a turn at babysitting Ino's youngest calf for a while. -Debbie Stewart

11:00 a.m. -
A group of about
5-6
showed up to join the fishing boats just before 11am. A bit of tail slapping followed by several breaches from one of the younger ones, before they seemed to split up and look for fish. Most of us pulled up our fishing gear and enjoyed the show - it was fun to see everyone pause to admire creatures far better at fishing than we will ever be! -Jennifer Wapenski

A few orcas
were milling off
Land Bank between 12-
1:00 p.m.
They never made it north of Deadman Bay so I never got positive IDs from Lime Kiln before they turned back south. -Monika Wieland
*
Onboard Glacier Spirit, just left
J17s near False Bay
. They were heading north, we had to head south for lunch in Friday Harbor. Saw some foraging but a couple breaches right as we arrived on scene around

10:45 this morning
. I'd never seen a breach before and I captured this shot of the first breach. Today is definitely one of the best days of my life, such a privilege to see these beautiful beings in their home. -Amy K Fowler

11:40 a.m. - 3 orcas heading east
about mid channel
between Port Angeles and Victoria
