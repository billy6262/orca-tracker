Just got in. We had what looked to be all of
J and K crossing Haro
. I heard L may have been coming behind them. -James Greshamn
*
Big seas and harsh lighting made for an interesting passby at
Lime Kiln
late this afternoon, where it was nearly impossible to ID anybody. It was a mix of
Js and Ks and maybe Ls
, so that narrows it down, right? -Monika Wieland

Hi, Saw a small group of
Orca in Brentwood Bay, North Saanich
on the
4:10 pm crossing from Mill Bay to Brentwood. They were traveling north between Senanus Island and the coast, then reversed south. Sorry no pics they were too far away. Don't usually see them down that way, hence my email. -Lesley Carere
*

8:40 a.m. -
Black fin specks in the distance
between Useless Bay and Point No Point, Admiralty Inlet
. I was looking through binoculars, and wasn't sure what I was looking at, until a breach and a white belly happened! Keep your eyes out, let me know where anyone else sees them! Appeared to be headed north. (Unconfirmed, Ashe later thought they
may have been dolphins
-ALB) -Ashe Davlin
*
Humpback: CS468
first seen in the Clayoquot Sound in 2011. This whale has been seen going back and forth
from Haro Strait to the Spieden Channel
area for the past week+. I love all these new humpbacks coming into the Salish Sea! -Heather MacIntyre

humpback
is slowly heading towards
Gig Harbor

Just had a single
humpback
buzz my deck at Salmon Beach traveling north, heading towards
Pt Defiance
. Closest I've ever seen them, maybe 30 yards out, wow! -Dino Martini
*

3:23
update: now
300
yards from the beach, heading possibly SE.

3:15p.m. - One humpback reported off Point No Point
in the direction of Double Bluff, no direction of travel, just milling, at one point about 50 meters off PNP. -Marilyn Deroy.

Humpback whale in Spieden channel
. I can't believe how many of these wonderful Humpbacks we are seeing in the area lately. What a treat to be able to see these animals regularly. -Traci Walter
*

12:15 p.m. -
Just saw a
humpback just nort of the west end of Spieden Island
. Only surfaced twice but we were treated to a nice full tail view! Headed west pretty quickly. I didn't see anything forward of the blow, just a small sickle shaped fin, quite a distance from the blow and a solid dark gray or black dorsum. -Dana Brooks
*

11:00 a.m. -
Gretchen Burger and I watched a
humpback whale
meander back and forth in
Rosario Straight between Sea Acres and Doe Bay
. He/she was close to the Orcas shoreline and appeared to be feeding. We watched it from about
11 am to 1 pm
. What a thrill!! -Ann Jones
*

10:00 a.m. - Humpback 1-2 in Spieden Channe
l heading east. -Peggy Mauro
*
9 :00 p.m. -
We saw
at least two humpbacks near Foul Weather Bluff in Skunk Bay
from our home which is located on a high bluff overlooking the Sound near Hansville, WA. They were about 500 meters off shore. There seemed to be at least two of them - one noticeably larger than the other(s). The large whale had a nearly all-white fluke underside when fluking. They were too far away to get decent pictures. They didn't seem to be heading anywhere but rather to be going slowly back and forth in a 500-square-meter area, spouting and fluking. We watched them for at least an hour. There were several small boats in the area - fishing boats and a sailboat under power - that seemed to be watching them, too.
The night before (11th), we also saw a few spouts and flukes in roughly the same location, and after dark we had heard the unmistakable whooshing of a whale spouting/breathing about 5-6 times every few minutes in front of the bluff moving in what seemed to be an west-east direction. We could not see it, but it seemed to be closer to shore since the breathing sound was quite loud. -Tom Buell Jr.

Hello! There was
a grey whale off Stanley Park in Vancouver, BC
today in the
afternoon
. Was feeding for the whole hour or so we were watching. Very close to the shore, just off the seawall. So happy I decided to go for a walk there today! -Laura Wenn
*

7:25 a.m. - Minke
sighting. On the
Coupeville-Port Townsend ferry
heading west, about half way across, it was headed east. -Rebekah Padgett
