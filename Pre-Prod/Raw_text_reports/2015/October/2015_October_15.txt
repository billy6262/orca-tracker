5:10 p.m. -
This is just to report
2 very, very large orcas
just traveled by in front of our house at the top of the north face of
Double Bluff
, my sighting as they were passing the green navigation buoy to the left (south)
heading north towards Bush Point
. They were maintaining a distance of about 400 yards off the shore, surfacing together about every 50 to 100 yards. In no hurry, just slowly/moderately passing along. By the time I got the camera and tripod out to record, by the time I had found them on the screen and focused they submerged and did not rise again. The sound of their breathing was clearly heard and caused our two dogs to bark at them. This did not seem to disturb them in any way; most likely since we are some 85' above the shore and water. -Michael Moore

5:30 p.m. -
Hi there! We are new to the area, so please forgive me that I don't know exact locations. Tonight, around
5:30 we were on the beach in
Mukilteo
near the lighthouse and saw 2 whales, near Whidbey Island. I thought they were Gray Whales at first, but upon research I discovered they were
humpbacks
. They were heading south, then heading north, then heading south again. Moving slowly and showing their tails. It was wonderful. When we left, they seemed to be heading north. -Holly C Cook

4:20 p.m. - A humpback 2-3 miles SSW of Scatchet Head
. From Sunset Ave N in Edmonds, it is line of sight with Double Bluff. -Sherman Page

2:30 p.m. - Humpback of the tip of Point Defiance
, Tacoma. -Rick Oppegaard
