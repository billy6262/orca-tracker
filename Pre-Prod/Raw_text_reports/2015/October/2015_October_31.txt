============================================================

Entry 1:
5:00 p.m. -
Just saw them from
Alki trending south...3 for sure
, but only saw them come up twice. Too far out to identify or get pictures. -Jill Hadji

4 orcas, including one adult male, southbound at West Point/Discovery Park (Seattle) at approx.
4:30

4:00 -
4:10 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound -
watched what is turning out to be a
4th whale (to Stu's 3)
After last report
humpback
flipped and is now traveling south, shallow surfaces approx. every minute in southerly direction. Same general area as earlier post.

repeated tail slaps by one of the three!

3:08 p.m. - humpbacks are back and forth'ing on the Kitsap side near Rose point and Elgon
. As seen due west from north Edmonds.

when I first saw these I thought it was an orca pod due to number of blows! But then I saw their back and knew it was humpbacks. I think it might be three - maybe a mom and calf + 1 - they are staying close together. Last dive was southerly most close to what I believe is near Rose point

2:42 p.m. - two, maybe three humpbacks about 1.5 miles south of Point No Point
heading northerly near shipping lanes Kitsap side. Whales relatively close together making seeing the blows easier.. Especially given this gusty day! -Stu Davidson
*

1:20 p.m. - central Puget Sound -
Charlie reports
a humpback whale off the North end of Vashon Island
, between Vashon and Blake Islands.
