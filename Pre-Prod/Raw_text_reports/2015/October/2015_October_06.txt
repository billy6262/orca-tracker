Hiked the
Ebey's Landing loop trail on Whidbey Island
. While on the shoreline, saw a
Gray Whale heading south
. Witnessed various surface behavior, including a full body breach. It was amazing...I remember seeing knuckles (through my binoculars) when the whale was just breaking the surface of the water while cruising. They were on the back end of the body, near the tail. Plus, this whale leapt vertically out of the water. At one point, it's entire body was perpendicular to the horizon. -Carmelo Quetell
