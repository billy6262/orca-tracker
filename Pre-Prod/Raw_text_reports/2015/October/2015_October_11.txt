============================================================

Entry 1:
6:30 p.m. - Echolocation on Lime Kiln hydros
right now! -Renee Beitzel
*
What a great day full of orcas ... first I got to see the
T034s and T037s
while I was working, then I went out again to see
T049C and T077A
(aka the "twins"), as well as
K and L pod
. Watching the resident orcas come into the Salish Sea in a large line, surfacing in respiratory synchronisty was definitely the highlight of my day! There's nothing that compares. -Heather MacIntyre
*
What a day! The Peregrine with First Mate, Melissa Sehgal, left the dock at Noon not knowing the location of any orcas. By the end of the day we got to see the
T034s and T037s up near Pt. Roberts
, thanks to a tip from someone on the BC Ferry, and the boat Explorithor. While coming back to our dock at Snug Harbor Resort and Marina, we got word of
Resident Orcas coming in!
While heading out to see the Residents on our second trip, we discovered the Transients known as The Twins,
T049C and T077A
. They are amazing! Very big! They travel together most of the time. Not brothers, just buds. We then went out to watch many of the Ks and Ls, heading toward San Juan Island. -James Maya, Mayas Legacy Whale Watching
*
We were lucky enough to spend time with some of the
SRKW's in front of Sooke
. We caught up to them by
Otter Point
and they were very wide spread
heading East
. After enjoying them we went to Race Rocks and met up with the residents again on our way back to the dock. They were very active and quite enjoyable to watch! -Deanne Brett
*
WOW! We left with a full boat on a
12:00pm departure today in Search of 3 or 4 humpbacks whales off Sooke... In minutes from our dock at Salty Towers we find
L & K pod coming in from the West right in front of Sooke!
Very social and active today...Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

Strait of Georgia
