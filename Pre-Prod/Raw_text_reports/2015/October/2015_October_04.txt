I observed
orcas

I paddled out from the coast towards them, and observed them surfacing for probably 10 minutes, after which they "disappeared." I waited another 10 minutes in the area looking for any signs, but didn't see any. This other person had been watching the for 45 minutes, she said. At one point I saw 4 in succession. Someone else I talked to said she had seen what she thought was a whole pod spread out. -Noah Townsend
