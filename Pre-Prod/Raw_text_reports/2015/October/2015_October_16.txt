Entry 1:
12:19 - 39 SRKW Orca heading North off Bowen Island headed for Texada Island, Georgia Strait
. ?K-pod, and 20 from L-pod. -Simon Pidcock, Cowichan (via Whales & Dolphins BC Sightings)

1:45 p.m. -
Thought someone might be interested in these
new rake marks on K35s left dorsal
. These were taken Oct 16 between the North Arm of the
Fraser River and Sandheads at
13:45
. He was with
K13s, K21, L90 and L92
but more that I could not ID were about. Pretty sure L122 and his family were about too. Mostly travel pretty spread out but they came together and headed East at the North Arm. There were some half breaches and tail slaps going on. -Kathryn Taylor

5:30 p.m. -
Pretty sure the transient "twins"
T49C and T77A went through Spieden channel
. I just got home and by the time I saw them around 6 PM they were by Sentinel and seemed to be heading west. -Peggy Mauro

BCZ0298 (AKA Split Fin) and an un identified humpback in Swanson's Channel
today. -Heather MacIntyre
*

4:30 p.m. - 1 humpback whale and 1 Pacific white-sided dolphin
...We've been hearing reports from friends about a humpback whale and its dolphin friend in south
Colvos Passage
for about 6 weeks. We went out on our sailboat hoping for a sighting. We spent about 30 minutes watching them roll, breach, and investigate boats (including ours). We capture many cool photos, including two that show the dolphin jumping over the top of the whale! We understand that both humpbacks and Pacific white sides are rare in the south Sound. The dolphin seems healthy -- VERY full of energy, speed, and social curiosity, porpoising over the humpback. Can't vouch for the health of the whale, but it was very active. -Cheryl Mikkelborg

1:25 p.m. - At Point No Point saw a humpback
just off the lighthouse. Saw blow and great tail view as it dove. Haven't seen reappear after several minutes. No known direction of travel. -Paul Hebert

12:40 p.m. - Humpback
milling mid channel off
Owen's Beach. (Point Defiance, Tacoma
). -Rick Oppegaard

9:18 a.m. - Humpback
spotted heading north just a bit south of
Gig Harbor
entrance. Slow rolls and slow pace. -Dino Martini

We had been enjoying watching a
humpback
out in the
Colvos passage
for about two weeks, starting on Labor Day...humpback is back with his little dolphin for about a week now and seems very happy eating, swimming, and breaching out in the Colvos. -Claudia Tolar

4:30 p.m. - Pacific white-sided dolphin
jumping over the top of the top of the humpback whale...The dolphin seems healthy , VERY full of energy, speed, and social curiosity. Colvos Passage. -Cheryl Mikkelborg

4:30-
5:30 p.m. -
We spent about 30 minutes watching them (
humpback and PWSDs
) roll, breach, and investigate boats (including ours). We capture many cool photos, including two that show the dolphin jumping over the top of the whale! Her/his unique dorsal and pec fin notches tell us this is the same dolphin who has been report in south Puget Sound area since at least August of 2014. -Cheryl Mikkelborg
