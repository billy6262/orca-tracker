Orca Sightings for October 29, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:54 a.m. -
I have a friend, Elysia, who now lives on the water in
Port Townsend
(lucky girl!). This is who they saw off their porch. Here are the co-ordinates they posted: so this was
NW of Pt. Hudson
, NW of Chetz, NW of red bell #2, between Pt Hudson and Pt. Wilson. They're excited to know the identities if anyone has any idea. I know it's a long shot. -Traci Wilson
*
Orcas NW of Pt. Hudson,
NW of Chetz, NW of red bell #2, between Pt Hudson and Pt. Wilson. -Elysia Hartzell

10:50 a.m. -
Saw about five , including one adult male and one female/juvenile,
heading north from Port Townsend toward Point Wilson
, at Point Hudson (the marina)....headed out of Admiralty. -Jen Matchem

We received a message from

10:13 this morning
from a woman reporting
a pod of orcas
off the
south end of "the island"
about 1/2 mile west of the south end ferry dock. Did not say which island but we are guessing Whidbey, and Clinton ferry dock? She said she has never seen this many before - but did not say how many or what direction they were traveling. We have left a message asking for more information, will post when we receive it - but perhaps someone should be looking in Possession Sound as well?

with blows and tails heading north towards
Double Bluff just outside Useless Bay

6:00 p.m.- north Puget Sound -
Marilyn Deroy is watching
two humpbacks east of Point No Point
, quite a ways out but with two blows almost simultaneously it must be two whales.
