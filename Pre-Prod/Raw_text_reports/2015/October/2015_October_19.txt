============================================================

Entry 1:
After a 15 mile run to the south of
Victoria
, BC...A

2:10 p.m. -
we've been watching what thought, and now confirmed is
2 humpbacks
...moving back and forth in same general area as
1:35 report. Went south about a mile now back on northerly pattern.

1:35 p.m. -
we see
humpback
(w/white on fluke) milling around approx. 2 miles west of us and
2 miles south of Cultus Bay
. Viewing from Sunset Ave, just north of Edmonds ferry Sightline looking at Double Bluff, way too far for photos. -Alisa & Ed

1:11 p.m. -
Spotting a

, Kitsap from the lighthouse. Sarah Roderick Fitch

9:58 a.m. -
At least
one Humpback is visible off the south end of Whidbey
this morning. I'm watching from Edmonds and it's extremely distant. Lots of blows made me wonder if there's two. -Alex Wilson
