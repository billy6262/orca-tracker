Looks like a

Blake close to Southworth terminal
, heading north at quick pace. Have some grainy pics with fluke splash will post later. On Tullikum -Wayne McFarland

It's not an orca. I just can't tell if maybe
humpback
or gray? I don't have a good enough camera to get it from where I am. I am at the Harper Pier. (confirmed humpback). -Ashley Yorba

11:50 a.m. -
I first spotted it (
humpback
) from the window at my house, then jumped in the car and saw it at a viewpoint from shore (which is where I took this photo) We live in
North Nanaimo
. The picture was taken from a location called Rocky Point #2. It is the 12th whale I've seen from home in the last year. But all of the other whales were Orcas so seeing a new one was extra exciting! -Adrienne Lacroix

11:01 a.m. -
The whale was back for over an hour going back and forth by
Blake Island
, but hard to tell what kind it is from the Harper Pier. Hope the whale comes back. -Molly Rainey

This was posted this morning on one of our local community pages: Looks like our "guest" whale is still here... sited near the
southwest part of Blake Island
this morning about
9:10 am today (Thursday)! -Ronda Barrow Hempler

3:00 p.m. - central Puget Sound Humpback

...it was a long way out. -Wayne McFarland
