Orca Sightings for November 5, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:00 p.m. -
Connie Bickerton heard faint calls on the
Port Townsend hydrophones at around 9 pm
, possibly K pod.
*
I was out at
Point No Point right at dark, about
4:50 pm until
5:30 pm.
Was told by a nice lady and her children that we
just missed the Orcas with a baby
, they also spotted a
humpback
. As we were there we could hear blowing and saw at least 2 big males, maybe a baby (a smaller dorsal close to the adult) and 2 other adults feeding just off the shore south of the lighthouse. Then they drifted north and then east following the tide rip until it got too dark to see. You could tell they were feeding, and not moving too fast. -Jann Clare
*
They were all spread out
between Whidbey Island and Point no Point
, Hansville, it took almost an hour for them all to pass, some far, some close. Heading North. It was a very large pod, all spread out with little ones, guessing J Pod. it was so calm that we could here them blowing in the distance, so magical!
