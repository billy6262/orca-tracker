Orca Sightings for November 1, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
The M/V Sea Lion had an incredible day out on the water with the
Southern Residents including K12 Sequim and K16 and K20 Spock
today, as they traveled south through
Rosario
. We found them in the pouring rain and 5 foot seas near
Lawson Reef
with the help of reports from the ferry and shore... Thanks to those who helped us find them today! They were in a very splashy mood: breaching, tail lobbing, and spyhopping. It seemed they were having a grand old time in the waves! -Sarah McCullagh
*
Southern Residents - There were whales everywhere. Several
groups of 3-7 whales. I saw at least 3+ babies and multiple adult males.
Seemed like they
paraded by Fort Ebey
for a good 20 minutes or more. Some groups closer to shore, some a little further out, but I'm so glad they came closer to the Whidbey side. So nice hearing them breathe, and having the problem of not knowing which orca pod to film because there were so many! When I saw the report of orcas southbound along Smith Island, I had to head out. It wasn't long before I realized there were dozens of whales and that they were residents!!! I had wanted, so desperately, to be there the moment the SRKWs came back for their first fall visit, and boy did my wish come true. I never expected them to hug Whidbey as they headed south, so it was quite the treat! I spent well over an hour with them at two different spots on Whidbey. Guess that fortune cookie was right after all! It's not the best video quality, and my camera wasn't always cooperating, but here's a sample of what I saw today! -Rachel Haight

5:36 -
6:26 p.m. - listened to Southern Residents (sounded like Js, Ks and some Ls) on Port Townsend hydrophone!!!
Happy day! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

5:50 p.m. - J pod too.

5:40 p.m. -
I heard plenty of
L pod calls
so unless Onyx was doing his talkative thing we have L pod in the mix. Wasn't sure about K pod though due to distance from hp. -Meg McDonald
*
Hearing calls on
PT hydrophone
5:35 pm
! Listen in to the
Southern Residents off Port Townsend, WA
- YAY!! so happy they are finally heading into Puget Sound (a month later than usual)! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*
I couldn't count fast enough but had to be at least
12 strung out swimming past Ft Ebey about
4:40 this evening
. Amazing sight! -Sharon Sherman
*

5:05 p.m. -
I left
Fort Ebey
the trailing group was well south of me and disappearing into the low light.

4:47 p.m. -
Should be on PT hydro soon. Hugging
Whidbey side south bound past Ebey
. I think it's J pod.

4:17 p.m. -
Big breach of an orca, they're off
Partridge Point (Whidbey) now
, southbound. Lots of them!!! Could it be residents?! -Rachel Haight
*

4:16 p.m. -
I just came in from watching, counted over 12, they traveled in a few smaller groups, traveled pretty fast, south, passed along the eastern side of the buoy, I think its the green one out there. They only just became so distant I couldn't track them anymore

3:29 p.m. - 4-6 orca along the north east side of Smith Island
. Slowly moving south along the island. Viewing with binoculars from our house along west beach. -Melinda Killian
*

2:07 p.m. -
Just spotted these whales. They are by the
south end of Lopez Island
now, presumably heading west. I can barely see blows and splashes (probably breaches) with my binos. -Rachel Haight
*
Noon -
Maia at WA State Ferries relayed a report of a pod of
8 orcas in Rosario St
., on the Anacortes side. No direction of travel given.
*
Awesome! We saw
one big male
as we were getting off the ferry at
Kingston this morning about 10am
. It was heading north. Can't be 100%, it was real quick but it was a distinct black fin...fairly large dorsal Wished I would of had more time to investigate! -Josh Murphy
*

4:14 p.m. - central Puget Sound -
He is still able to be seen at the pier (Harper Pier, Port Orchard) he did a deeper dive but he's here, gonna see if I can find a closer spot and it's definitely a
humpback
! -Ashley Arciniega-Luu
*

4:00 p.m. - north central Puget Sound -
Easy to locate as the
humpback
is being followed by a huge flock of gulls. The Whale is definitely feeding off a fish ball.
3:31 p.m. - huge splashes (breaching) just east of Point No Point. Likely a humpback. Easily seen naked eye from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson
*

2:50 p.m. - Saratoga Passage -
Multiple blows and back sightings off west side of
Camano Island, near Madrona Beach
. Guessing
humpbacks
... Don't look like orcas. Appear to be feeding and slowing moving north. -Lise Place
*

2:43 p.m. - central Puget Sound
- Just saw him from
Harper Pier
, Port Orchard. Did not get photo, but saw
humpback
fluke.

2:27 p.m. -
Whale sighting now south of
Blake island
, can see spout from Harper pier. -Rachel Pamela
*

2:00 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound -
several whales (separate blows)
near Eglon area, between Kingston and Point No Point
. -Stu Davidson
*

1:36 p.m. - central Puget Sound -
Still a whale
near Blake Island
(just to the NW of it) today. Spotted from the ferry, crew says it was also here an hour ago. Couldn't tell type, multiple blows, one spyhop, but seen only briefly and from a distance. I'm thinking humpback. Nose had more that shape, from what I briefly saw. -Karl Johnson
*

12:15 p.m. - north/central Puget Sound -
whale blows near
Rose Point (north of Kingston)
. Type and direction again unknown yet (weather is limiting good views).

9:20 a.m. - whale blow
just
north of Kingston ferry terminal
(maybe 1/4 mile). Type or direction hasn't been determined yet. (An probable orca sighting was reported in same general location. Each report could be orca or humpback, both species have been in the area - ALB) -Stu Davidson
*

9:30 a.m. LARGE mystery whale in Eld Inlet.
First spotted a very tall (15+ feet) "blow" heading south. Went to the deck. Heard a VERY LOUD blow to my south. Then one to the north. Then it apparently circled around and surfaced less than 20 feet off my bank. Could only get one quick photo of its back. It has a very distinct dorsal fin - making me question if its a different whale than a humpback. It circled around again and did a shallow surface about 40 feet from shore. I wasn't prepared for it to do that. No other photo I.D. Very choppy water and high wind makes its blows dissipate very quickly. Never showed a fluke. Last seen heading north toward Squaxin Island. -Kim Merriman
