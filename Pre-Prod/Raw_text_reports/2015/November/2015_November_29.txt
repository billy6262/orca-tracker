Orca Sightings for November 29, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:45 p.m. -
The
whale was pretty much straight out from the Puget Marina, probably pretty close to shore and we watched it drift south toward Tolmie Park
. We saw blows and the birds were massed on the water and rose into the air with each set of blows. Seeing whale spouts from Andy's Marine Park Beach on Anderson Island looking across to the Nisqually Reach preserve. No direction, feeding and breaching, but very distant for observation from here. Likely humpback/gray, not orca. -Belen Schneider

My husband and I saw
2 Orcas
spy hopping and breaching off the
California coast halfway between Pescadero and Santa Cruz
. They were clearly feeding as they stayed in the same spot for a long while but would disappear under water then resurface minutes later. At least other whales were spouting farther out and to the side, but I couldn't identify them as Orcas. By the way, we also noticed a few seals had come in close to shore and were just hanging out. -Nancy Walker
