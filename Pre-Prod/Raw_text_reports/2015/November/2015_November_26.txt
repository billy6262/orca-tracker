Orca Sightings for November 26, 2015

Entry 1:

Ken Balcomb reports the

12:15 p.m. to
12:40 p.m. - Probable humpback blows off Point No Point
seen from south of Bush Point. Can't tell if it's more than one humpback, but we're just happy to see humpbacks in the Possession Triangle (roughly from Edmonds to Kingston to Scatchet Head on Whidbey Island). That makes almost three months of possibly continual visitation in that area by up to three or four humpbacks some days. Not to mention regular humpback sightings in the south Sound, and all around the Salish Sea. There's much to say thanks for on this Thanksgiving Day. Wishing everyone a happy Thanksgiving. -Susan and Howard, Orca Network

10:37 a.m. -
About an hour ago I drove across the
Hood Canal Bridge and saw blows
only about 100 yards north of the bridge, mid span. Definitely not humpback, but I couldn't stop to look closer. Couldn't see the back or tail. Lots of birds at the surface too. -Amy K Fowler
