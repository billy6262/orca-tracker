Boarded the Peregrine at 1PM and we were initially heading to see some humpbacks off of Victoria. It was a good thing we topped off the gas tanks before heading out because after arriving to Victoria we got word of
orcas out past Race Rocks
. And yes,
residents
! Wow. Our final destination put us smack dab in the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca west of Port Angeles between Sooke and Cliffs. We arrived on scene after

3:00 PM
and encountered some
members of the K12's
very spread out and foraging. We saw
K33
actively fishing. They were slowly
moving westward
. Looking towards the Olympic Peninsula and the Elwha Valley, you can't help but reflect on the positive effects the Elwha restoration will have on salmon recovery and our resolve must not be broken until the Snake River Dams are breached as well. -Debbie Stewart

K POD
TODAY!! When we got a report early this morning of killer whales heading west, no one expected to see the Resident Orcas today. I however, held out hope. Historically, they always seem to make an appearance right around, or on Thanksgiving. Today, we happened to get lucky when Dale Mitchell (out of Victoria) found these guys milling
close to the mouth of the Elwha River. Members of K Pod were spread out foraging
, as you might expect for this time of year. Their food source (Chinook/King salmon) is getting scarce now with our dramatically reduced salmonid population here in the Pacific Northwest, so they will need to be serious about foraging if they're to survive the winter. These whales will average 80 miles per day of travel this time of year, and will need to replenish the calories they burn traveling daily. What a treat to see these guys today ... they may not have been jumping out of the water in full breaches, but each moment with them was precious. I'm so grateful that I got to spend some time with them! -Heather MacIntyre
