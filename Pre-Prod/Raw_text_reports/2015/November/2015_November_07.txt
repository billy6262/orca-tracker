Orca Sightings for November 7, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:33 p.m. - south Puget Sound - It's a humpback!
Swimming south towards town of
Steilacoom
. 50 to 100 yards offshore.

12:29 p.m. - Whale
sighted just offshore near
Steilacoom
. Just below Madrona Park! Big spout. Sloping back. Waiting to see more. First seen below Madrona Park, heading south. It swam further towards the shore, almost right up to the ferry dock. Then headed back out into the inlet and we lost sight of it in the rain. Lots of spouting. Saw its sloped back many times. Caught a good look at its tail once. Beautiful! -Tari Poe Norris

10:36 a.m. -
Watching spouts from the
Steilacoom/Anderson Island Ferry
this morning. They are near the entrance to Carr Inlet, between Fox Island and McNeil Island closer to Fox. To far off to have any details, can't identify the type of whale. It looks like more than just one, and they are pretty continuous. There appears to be two boats near them. No idea on direction. -Peace Corey
