Off
Sooke, BC

12:04 p.m. - J50 with a chunk of salmon, J52 Sonic, J26 Mike, J2 Granny, J34 Doublestuf with his mother J22 Oreo, K26 Lobo near Sooke. J36 Alki with her son J52 Sonic and sister J50 Scarlett. Westbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca near Sooke BC
this afternoon. We spent time with many members of J Pod, and a few K Pod whales. L92 made a brief appearance and other L Pod whales could be seen in the distance This is a huge crop and it caused the image to suffer some but this is important as it confirms she is eating solid food. It also appeared to me that she caught the salmon on her own. -James Gresham

After a wonderful
afternoon
at the grand opening celebration of the Langley Whale Center we were on the
4pm
ferry crossing from
Clinton to Mukilteo
. Mid crossing I was happily surprised by a whale surfacing in between the ferry lanes.
A Gray whale!
Ed confirmed! We watched it surface and fluke several times. We headed over to Lighthouse park and spoke with police officer Peg Bohan who said she' s been seeing grays lately in this area. So, there really are grays up in Possession Sound in November. Interesting. -Alisa & Ed

Humpback north of Port Angeles
