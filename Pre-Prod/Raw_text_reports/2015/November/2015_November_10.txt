Reports this morning of two separate groups of whales, not together but just a few miles apart had me presuming the larger group was the
Southern Residents,
and very curious about the second group. Kimberly first spotted them
off Manchester
, and then subsequent reports from Brittany, Sue Larkin and others had me chasing these whales. They headed north, as the residents flipped north too, and the T's took off. They made record speed around
Restoration Point
on Bainbridge Island and past the Bainbridge ferry lanes to Rolling Bay, while the Residents were near the north end of Vashon Island. I headed to Rolling Bay Bluff. Not long after I started searching, they popped up in front of me, and appeared to rest from their exertion for a few minutes.Susan showed up and not only did she see them, but her Mom got to see them too. These
Transients
resumed their travels at a slower but steady speed in typical sneaky T behavior by disappearing for a good amount of time before popping back up further north, traveling on the west side of
Puget Sound
mid-channel. Identified by Sara as
T37As, T37 and T34s
. Thanks everyone - much fun running into you all today!

1:46 p.m. - Northern group of Transients
continued north after a few minutes of resting. They are on the west side of mid channel.

Rolling Bay
