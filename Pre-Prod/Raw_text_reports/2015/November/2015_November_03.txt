We watched about

between Vashon and Maury

8:30. They then appeared to head back east then north toward Point Robinson. This was the first time I have ever heard of orcas actually coming into Quartermaster Harbor. They were very active. We watched from about 3/4 mile away from our house and beach on the Vashon side of the harbor. -Jeffrey Gill

A message from Paul Cotrell, DFO Marine Mammal Coordinator: We received a report/pictures yesterday through the BC Marine Mammal Response Network that
T077A may have a rope and float entanglement
(see photo). The animal was sighted with the gear from the
Thetis Island-Chemainus Ferry
in Stuart Channel (20 miles south of Nanaimo). If you can add this information to your Orca Network with the details that if the animal is sighted to please call the BCMMRN 1-800-465-4336 (in Canada), or 1-877-SOS-WHALe (1-877-767-9425) (in US) and if gear still attached to monitor from a distance and not engage with the animal or gear. We have our expert disentanglement team ready to go. Hopefully the gear has come off on its own. Paul Cottrell, Pacific Marine Mammal Coordinator Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Fisheries Management Branch

Between 10 and 11am today, lone humpback feeding in Dalco /Colvos area
. -Michele Riley Campbell
*

3:13 p.m. -
We are in
Cultus Bay
, looking toward Eglon, out in midchannel --
large blow spout
, barely seeing the watery sheen as something (humongous lions mane jellyfish just learning to exhale?) passes going northerly. -John Morelock
*

12:50 p.m. -
spotted the
humpback
from some distance away. I'm above
Golden Gardens
with very large binocs looking north. Blows close to Kitsap side. Humpback is
south of Point No Point but still well north of Kingston ferry
. Hard to pinpoint location with the collapsed view from my vantage. He's closer to shore than the bunch of fishing boats I see in the vicinity. Now that I mapped it probably still near Eglon as other commenter reported from earlier. -Jennifer Greiner Clark
*

11:15 am - two humpbacks
, one just
north of Eglon and another south of Eglon
, a few hundred yards offshore Kitsap side. -Sherman Page
*

8:00 a.m. -
while scouting for
orcas
up north (didn't see any) I did see a tall blow of what I am assuming was a
humpback about a half mile south of Point No Point.
