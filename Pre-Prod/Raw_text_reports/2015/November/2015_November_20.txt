Orca Sightings for November 20, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:30 p.m. - Admiralty Inlet
- They slowed considerably and are just hanging around
Lagoon Pt
, mid channel and more on
Kitsap
side. Too far away for saddles, but they appeared to be fishing. I would guess
15+
, but no clue as they were spread out far and wide.

3:30 p.m. -
And even more. Big breach more mid channel and north. Spread out in small groups.

3:28 p.m. -
Just found them. About to pass
Lagoon Pt.
Whidbey side. There's a lot. Spotted another group further south and west. -Rachel Haight
*

4:13 p.m. - 10-12 orca just passed Lagoon Point
, heading south to Bush Point mainly on Marrowstone side. -Paula Ratcliff

2:37 p.m. -
3:40 p.m. -
Amy Johnson at the Pt. Townsend Marine Science Center reports a pod of
8-12 orcas off Ft Casey State Park heading south
.
*

2:30 p.m. - Orcas (5-6?) off Point Wilson heading towards Bush Point
. Passing Keystone / Coupeville Ferry terminal. -Betsy Carlson
*
I spent the day wandering around Whidbey. I tried to find the orcas in Saratoga. I spotted a male off Hidden Beach for about two minutes, and then I never saw that pod again. I looked all over the place for them too. Then, as I was giving up, I saw a report of inbound
orcas in Admiralty
. I spotted them at
Lagoon Pt
, where they slowed down considerably, and appeared to be foraging. I watched the sunset behind the snow covered OIympics as the orcas slowly trended south. It was a beautiful sunny day. -Rachel Haight
*

2:25 p.m. -
WSF reports from
Salish ferry on Port Townsend/Keystone run seeing 3-8 orcas headed south in shipping glanes toward Marrowstone Point
.
*

11:45 a.m. - Small orca
--light was behind it and it was too far out in the water to see details. One small whale, near
Fort Ebey
traveling south to northwest. Swimming around in one area but slowly working it's way west. Light and distances made it impossible to see markings. -Diana Butler and David Paull
*

1:52 p.m. - Saratoga Passage
- I think there are
at least 6
judging from blows. They are spread out.

1:37 p.m. -
at least 4 blows. Bypassed Holmes Harbor and continued heading south.

1:30 p.m. -
see them towards
Greenbank
, heading towards Holmes Harbor. -Krista Paulino

Caught brief glimpses of blows
south of Holmes Harbor around
