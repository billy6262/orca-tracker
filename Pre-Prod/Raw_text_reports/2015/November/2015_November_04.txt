Orca Sightings for November 4, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Days recap by Rachel Haight who first spotted and reported the orcas: My whale scouting routine always starts at
Ebey's Landing
. When I first arrived, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something black, then disappear. I figured it was a bird, since it is 99% of the time. As I was about to drive up the bluff for a better look, I looked out my window and saw multiple fins! What I initially took to be a small pod of transients turned out to actually be a lot of residents! I followed them as they traveled south past Whidbey and past Edmonds with Alisa as well. We even saw
a humpback in the same vicinity as the orcas
. The closest pictures were taken from
Bush Pt,
while the picture of the
line of blows was taken at Edmonds
. The line of their backlit blows as they swam along were breathtaking.
