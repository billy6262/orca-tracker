Orca Sightings for November 19, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:00 p.m. -
Received a call from Debbie reporting
4 - 5 orcas heading north a little bit south of Clinton ferry dock
.
*

3:40 p.m. - one small orca between Mukilteo and Clinton
on the north side of the ferry boat during the crossing, traveling north swimming, not very fast. Too far away to see many markings except for some white coloring at the base of the black dorsal fin. I've seen whales in this area before, but always in a group; I've never seen a solo orca there before. Thanks for your good work. -Diana Butler and David Paull
*

10:00 a.m. - North end of Vashon
at the WSF Vashon Ferry Terminal.
Whales
were headed north, one breaching... I did not spend time observing them as I had to attend to other work activities. Therefore I don't have a good count. -Burt Miller, WSF
*

8:16 a.m. -
WS Ferries reports a small pod of
3-6 orcas milling mid-channel near the Port Townsend/Coupeville
ferry lane. No direction given.
