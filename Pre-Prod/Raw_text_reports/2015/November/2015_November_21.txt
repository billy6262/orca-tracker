11:58 a.m. - NW Whidbey -
I'm seeing breaching and lots of feeding action off the

, traveling North they are
south of Smith isla
nd right now. I'm .25 miles up from the Hastie lake boat area they are right in front of me, easily seen with the naked eye. Definitely orcas! At least 4. Feeding at the surface, there are lots of gulls taking advantage of the carnage, -Melinda Killian
*
Puget Sound - I was waiting at
Point No Point
, Kitsap for the orcas as darkness fell... They were off in the distance, but I also believe there were
four humpbacks
in the area as well. There was a pair together, another one a little further north, and then one humpback practically came up onto the beach, it was so close. There was also a breach in another location, I
*
think
*
it was an orca, but it was pretty huge, and may have been a 5th humpback. Lots of whales around today! -Rachel Haight

3:36 p.m. - Waiting at Eglon Beach
and just spotted a
humpback
! -Elyse Sollitto

Haro Strait -
The photo was taken from "The Sea Lion"-San Juan Safari's boat-that went out at noon...we found them
around
1:48 pm
using my iPhone. We didn't see three, but we saw
a mother humpback and her calf
milling about for about 30-40 minutes in the same area they were reporting seeing the three in the morning. -Amanda Marie Colbert

with Connie Bickerton and Sara Hysong-Shimazu. Connie spotted the blows of a
humpback
due west, mid channel. We all watched it surface and blow for several minutes before it dove, it surfaced several minutes later at it continued north then went on a dive again. We could not re-sight the whale again. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

2:15 p.m. - Puget Sound - saw a couple of whales off President Pt, Kitsap
, heading north. I don't think they were Orca whales. (Orca whales came by about 1/2 hour later, the first two may have been humpbacks). -Joanne Graves

e) a mile or so south of
Point No Point near Kitsap side
