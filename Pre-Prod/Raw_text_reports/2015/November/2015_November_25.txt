this was posted on another group I belong to, "Im at Al's and can see them near
Point Richmond
out in the middle" (to confirm orca came up Colvos). -Brittany Gordon

4:00 p.m. -
they were fighting the current and moving pretty slow. A group six or so! We think they headed up the channel between

They are at
Point Defiance

Just saw
3-4 orcas in Gig Harbor very near the Narrows Bridge

Spotted about
5-7 whales
just south of the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge
, making their way North. A nice Thanksgiving treat. -Beverly Walker

Report of
orcas heading North around the east side of Anderson island
, past Cole Point. Talked to the gentleman who lived on Cole Point and had seen them around
