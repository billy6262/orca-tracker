Well, today was one of coolest encounters I've had in a while. Went way up north near
Point Roberts
to catch up with some of the whales that were having a bit of a party on the west side of San Juan last night until about midnight. Was worth the run though! Lots of wonderful activity with spyhops and breaches galore! Here's a couple of

Did anyone else happen to see a pod of
orcas off of the Discovery Park
beach (West Point Seattle) area around
10:30 this morning? My friend and I didn't have binoculars but we both saw what looked like
4-5 whales
...is this possible? -Jennifer Lausen

Puget Sound -
Report from Emily Crandall and Benjamin Doerr who spotted what most likely was
a small humpback off the SE coast of Bainbridge Island
, just outside the mouth of Blakely Harbor. It moved very swiftly to the south and they parted ways at the red buoy off Restoration Point.
