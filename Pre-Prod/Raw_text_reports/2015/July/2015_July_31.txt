Orca Sightings for July 31, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:20pm to
8:30pm - From Lime Kiln Lighthouse
we got quite a treat. At first two orcas were transiting toward the south many many yards out in
Haro Strait
. Then coincident with a whale watching boat passing buy, more orcas appeared right in front of the lighthouse. We were treated with about seven orcas passing by toward the south. These ~ 7 orcas were only a "stone's throw" from the shore as they passed by! It looked like at least 2 males with their tall dorsal fins. -Greg Salo

Haro Strait
- always an impressive sight!
