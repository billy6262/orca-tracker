We are finally getting a sprinkle of rain here in the Pacific Northwest. I love how cool and fresh the air is and I adore the cloud formations and the lighting that develops due to oncoming showers. We had
members of all three resident pods
off the
south end of San Juan Island
this afternoon in jaw-dropping light. -Katie Jones

1:30 pm -
Lots of
orcas from Eagle Point to Pile Point
. Some close in and some further out, all passed by our rock and then angled over to Cattle Pass area then over closer to Hein Bank. One group in slow sleeping mode, tight together. All came back to our rock beginning at
6:00 until around
7:00, going towards Pile Point. Not too scientific but maybe gives you an idea of their movements, very fun to watch!! -Jenny Stands Wilson

This group of whales (
J2s, J19s, and K14s
see
July 11th) made their way back down
from the Fraser River
and met up with other
Js, Ks, and Ls in Haro Strait
. Around noon we picked up the
J2s, J19s, and K14s heading south with the K12s and K13s at Open Bay
. Near Lime Kiln they also met up with the
L4s and L47s, and off False Bay the J16s
