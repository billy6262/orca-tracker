Orca Sightings for July 6, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of J, K, and L Pods
went back and forth off the
west side of San Juan Island all day
. I heard that the L22s were hanging out off False Bay (while the rest of the L12 sub-group had gone west). The others came down Haro in the morning, went north in the afternoon, and then came south again in the evening. I saw this third pass as they headed south past Lime Kiln around
6:30 PM. Not quite everyone was present - the J16s and perhaps a few more were continuing north, but the rest of J-Pod, most or all of K-Pod, and most or all of the Ls (minus the L22s) were there. There are
4 L-Pod whales (L72, L105, L90, and L92)
that usually travel with the Greater L4s that haven't been with them in inland waters so far this summer, but they were back with the pack. That means I got to see them for the first time this year! Distinct male L92 Crewser is shown here in the orange waters off Lime Kiln. The abundance of local wildfires has made for the surreal lighting these last couple of days. -Monika Wieland

K21 Cappuccino
surfacing just north of
Henry Island
this evening. No filter on this, it's all that hazy, smoky lighting. It was, despite the smokiness, really nice to see this big guy. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

6:34 pm -
intermittent echo
clicks and some squeaks on the hydrophones at Lime Kiln
right now...sound distant and getting closer... -Wayne McFarland

4:38 pm -
I took a whale watching tour out of Friday Harbor on Monday. We saw
35-40 orcas
, and the guide said it was one of the best tours she'd ever done as far as the number of whales we saw. We were on the west side of San Juan Island, and went up past the Lime Kiln Lighthouse. -Barb White

12:06 pm - They are milling off American camp now.

11:00-
11:28 am - Parade of whales by Lime Kiln
...Although we missed front of pod, we estimate
about 30
just since we arrived. Appears last one passed by about
11:28. Whale soup at Lime Kiln Lighthouse this afternoon. A whale photographer standing next to us said J, K and L were the groups we saw today. She said the babies in front of us were J50 and J52, J51 had gone by earlier. We watched from American camp until about
1:30. We thought pod had headed out but some turned and came back to the camp where they appeared to be milling and feeding. Saw some lunge behavior like they were chasing fish. They appeared to be slowly working their way north again maybe back to Lime Kiln. One whale further out in channel breached and lobbed so may times (more than 20), that I stopped counting. Numerous whale boats in area, so imagine pics will start streaming in. What a lucky, wonderful day! -Krista Paulino
