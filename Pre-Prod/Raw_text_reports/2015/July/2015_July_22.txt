Good evening! We had a nice little visit with the
T60s right outside Friday Harbor this evening
. I love it when whales show up on our back doorstep. What a treat! This is the first transient orca encounter we've had in ages and apparently they were traveling up San Juan Channel nailing everything they could catch this afternoon. We should start to see more transient orcas as we get closer to autumn. All those baby seals are being weaned from their mothers and some of them become important food for the orcas. I know it's hard to think about the whales munching on those cute little seals, but everyone has to eat. It's the raw power of nature and it keeps our planet in balance. -Katie Jones

Had a wonderful encounter just
outside Friday Harbor tonight with transients
tonight! -Traci Walter

5:30 pm -
The whales were on the
east side of San Juan Island
moving towards Friday Harbor but traveled on NW further towards Shaw Island. It was a magical encounter with the
T060s
, a group of 5 whales, 3 building the head (1 male, 1 female, 1 juvenile) and 2 more whales following at a bit of a distance. 3-4 harbor seal-kills were witnessed by other people! I need to check my photos if I can find some of the two adults bringing up the rear. -Astrid Heinisch

...we then moved out to
Salmon Bank to see transients, T-060 group
, who were very purposely moving toward Long Island for a possible harbor seal snack. -Bonnie Gretz
