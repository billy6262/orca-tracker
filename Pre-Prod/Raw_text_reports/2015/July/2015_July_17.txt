Sounds like he's back down to

10:15 pm -
Has anyone heard any various vocals, or just the one call? The
call I'm hearing now the OS hydrophones is S2iii, the L12 sub-group call, so I'm thinking it's likely we're hearing L87
...I'm assuming it's L87 by himself. -Monika Wieland

Today, we first came across a
pair of synchronized minkes
not far from the south end of San Juan Island (SJI). We continued north following the
K13s
heading north along the west side of
SJI
. Near Hannah Heights, they suddenly turned south swimming hard against the current. There were several breaches from
K44
Ripple as he swam alongside his mom
K27
Deadhead. Then, K20 Spock followed by son K38 Comet turned and made a close pass by the boat. As we were getting ready to head home,
L87
Onyx suddenly appeared not far from the boat quickly moving south. It was a lovely afternoon spent with whale friends followed by a stunning sunset... -Rachel Haight
*
He,
L87
, was with
Granny
headed north (in
Haro Strait
). They came up on
J19s + K26
+ others headed south in resting mode. The large group did a long dive and came up headed north. Onyx and Granny continued together for a while, but at the south end of
Land Bank
Onyx came out close to the boat. He almost passed under the bow and headed out alone towards the middle of Haro. -Connie Bickerton

J2s
(includes J14s),
J19s, K13s, and K14s
went north past
Lime Kiln from 1245-1345
, then flipped and
went back south by 1415
. -Monika Wieland

It was very neat to see
a tribal canoe
out there with the whales today, drumming and singing as some
Js and Ks
went by.-Monika Wieland
