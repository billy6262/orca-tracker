With overcast skies and hazy air, we headed to the
west side of San Juan Island
, hearing that
J-pod
was in the area. But first checked out all the beautiful harbor seals, some with new pups on Colville Island. Continuing north, we found - not J-pod (who were further north) - but members of
K-pod AND L-pod
!! We spent time with the
K-12s and L-22 and her son L89
, what a treat! They traveled north, then south, between Hannah Heights and Cattle Point. So beautiful to see them in the mirror-like conditions of the Salish Sea - what an amazing day for us all, with lots of sea-birds, harbor porpoise, and bald eagles. -Jill Hein
*
A trio of
three male orcas
gave us quite a unique and intimate show of behavior in the afternoonfrom the Island Explorer 3.
L89, K33, and K37
followed each other around in circles, rolling around, splashing, lunging, and taillobbing. The behavior kept going on for quite a while before K37 peeled off and the other two just continued with the play. We could only take wild guesses at what it meant to all of them, but it sure looked like some big time bonding with the dudes! -Bart Rulon
*
K44 spyhop, and K13, this afternoon off of Point Roberts
. -Gary Sutton
*
We spent time with the
K13's
out in the middle of the
Strait of Georgia
as they headed towards East Point. This was my first opportunity this season to see this family. While the waves weren't very big, the current was fairly strong so we saw them splashing through the water. -Ashley Keegan
*
We spotted
a humpback whale in Puget Sound!
Just s
outh of Point Wells
moving south, keeping a low profile at

8:35ish
. The poor guy is VERY hunched over, only showing his dorsal fin on deep dives. May have entangled flukes or spinal deformity. Will post photos soon...He's very hard to spot, only lifting himself just high enough to breathe and taking 3-4 minute dives between each dive sequence. -Justine Buckmaster
*

8:30 am -
This is the
little Humpback Juvenile with the hunched backoff Point Wells
, Woodway. He was very shy and could only get the very top of his dorsal area. Came to surface a number of times but then rolled under the water only showing a small portion of his back. -Wayne McFarland
