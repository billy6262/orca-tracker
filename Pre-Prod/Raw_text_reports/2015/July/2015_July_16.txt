Orca Sightings for July 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We traveled via Thatcher Pass, through the islands, and thanks to first mate Eric's "eagle eyes", found
a humpback whale fairly close to the Lopez ferry dock
! We were the first on scene and enjoyed watching him foraging for quite some time before other boats arrived. We then headed out towards Salmon Bank and found
"Nick Jagger", the Minke
whale who is easy to identify!! We also had the opportunity to see harbor seal pups at one of the popular haul-out areas, bald eagles, and a few harbor porpoise. Although the orcas were "far" up north today, we still had a great day viewing our local marine mammals! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
