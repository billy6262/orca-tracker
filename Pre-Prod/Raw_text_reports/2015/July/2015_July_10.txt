Orca Sightings for July 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Little
J51
was breaching like crazy, near
Eagle Cove, San Juan Island
. I love watching the babies, especially when they're playful! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Yoda (
K36
) breaching tonight. The
J14s and K14s
were hanging out and the kids were in full-on social mode. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
L087
breaching off of freighter wake in the
Oak Bay Flats
-Mark Malleson
*
It's been blustery out there for day's now! I can't wait for when the water is like glass again. ...here are some shots with the
J2's, J19's, and K14's off False Bay
. I have to say, J51 was in a particularly rambunctious mood (if such a thing happens to orcas)! -Heather MacIntyre

16:37
Hearing calls on
Lime Kiln
. -Jill Clogston
