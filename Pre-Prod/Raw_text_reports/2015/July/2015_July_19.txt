I saw
Onyx go through Active Pass with J's
today, into Georgia Strait. Love that big guy! -Ali Barratt

from cliffside on
Saturna Island
(close to East Point). -James James McLarnon

J2 Granny
came back down south to forage with the group off
Kellet Bluff, Henry Island
. Who's traveling with who these days? We had the
J14's, the K14's, K27 and K44
traveling north up Haro Strait yesterday. Here they stopped to socialize. As the K13's came back down south, they took K27 and K44 with them as you might expect.-Heather MacIntyre
*

7:30 pm -
We started the morning listening to them and once again we have the privilege of eavesdropping on the
SRKWs on the Lime Kiln hydrophone
(located on the west side of San Juan Island, WA) as we finalize this report this evening. Some lucky folks sitting on the rocks on the west side of San Juan Island are going to have a memorable experience. -Alisa, ON

*

10:15 am - J2s (includes J14s), K13s, K14s
still northbound off
Spieden Channel
. It's been a while since the conditions have been right for us to get on the water for an early morning with whales - but today the stars aligned! We had our 31st (!!) research encounter with the Southern Residents as we met up with some Js and Ks a little before

7:30 AM
this morning. While we got some of our best hydrophone recordings of the season, I think the moment that astounded us the most was actually hearing whale vocalizations through the hull of our boat! We had heard this was possible, but none of us had experienced it until today - it was pretty unreal! -Monika Wieland, Orca Behavior Institute

1:00 pm - at least 5, possibly as many as 8 animals.
Approximately 37.671ºN, 123.119ºW ... that's a very inaccurate estimate - I'll try to get GPS coordinates from the boat captain. Traveling vaguely west, but a number of changes in direction were observed. They moved in line abreast for about 5 minutes, then changed direction and milled around for several more minutes. One large male had a notch cut into the trailing edge of his dorsal fin about 3/4 of the way down. -Steve Wood
(Orcas sighted in the
Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary
. Alisa Schulman-Janiger and Dave Ellifrit have gone over these and could not identify them.)

Here is some information about an Orca sighting today at
The Farallones
. The sightings were from an Oceanic Society Expeditions boat. We would really love to know the identity of these whales. Please let us know once you have figured it out. Oceanic Society would be thrilled to share this information with its subscribers. Start of Encounter:
11 am
37 38. 680 N -123 06.285 W. End of Encounter:
1230 pm
37 43.070 N -123 12.596 W. There were
6 individuals
-two large males with large dorsal fins, then two smaller animals with curved fins (possibly females or young males), then two small orcas, not tiny new born, but definitely calves. -Peter Winch
