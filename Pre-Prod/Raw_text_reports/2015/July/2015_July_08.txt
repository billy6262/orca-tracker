Beautiful sighting!
Otter Point (Sooke, BC)
on the Juan de Fuca.
So large a pod (40-50)
that we were able to watch them for at least 15 min. All sizes. Traveling but there was a bit of play. Filled my heart! -Martine Skillen

I got off for a while during boat noise and then couldn't get back on, but just re-established connection and calls still going strong and beautiful. Can hear on

and heard distant calls. Calls from what sounded to be members of all pods continued simultaneoulsy on both Lime Kiln and OrcaSound. I've at least 8 recordings and many notes to sift through but definite loud S4 calls at LK around
10:30. A beautiful summer evening filled with SRKWs in stereo throughout Haro Strait. Calls, whistles and echolocation continued late into the night. At
10:50pm I turned off as the communication played on. -Alisa, ON

At about

8:00 am
one of our passengers reported a whale behaving much like the
Humpback
we saw yesterday, east of the traffic lanes
near Meadow Point (Golden Gardens, north Seattle)
moving South. I didn't see it myself since they reported it 10 minutes after we had passed but it sounds like the same animal, with a hunched back. -Justine Buckmaster

Heard reports of
a gray whale in Dyes Inlet about
8:30
tonight. -Karen Guyt
A Gray whale was reported in this general area of Bremerton a month ago: Sinclair Inlet on

We were headed out on our way down towards the
West side of San Juan Island
when we got a report of
a group of orca up towards Entrance Island
. We altered course to see if we could find them and were rewarded with a visit with
T125, T127
(not sure where T128 or T125A were), and the
T46Cs (T46C, T46C1, T46C2 and T46C3)
. Great group who had a seal snack during our visit with them! Have a great evening! -Ashley Keegan
