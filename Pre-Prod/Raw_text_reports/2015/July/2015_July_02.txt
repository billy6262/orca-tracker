Orca Sightings for July 2, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sunset whales...The same whales that have been around for the past week or so (
J-pod, Group A and the K14s
) were off the west side and heading south in a hurry. On our way out we stopped for a quick but excellent look at a couple of minke whales that were foraging off of Salmon Bank. We continued north but we didn't have to go far before the evening light began illuminating the blows of our orca friends. The first whales we saw were
Hy'shqa (J37)
and her young son,
T'ilem I'nges (J49)
. This young male was the last baby to be born and survive before we welcomed our four new babies. He'll be three years old this year! He's growing up so quickly. I've noticed it a little recently but tonight especially so that his dorsal is starting to look a lot like his mother's... -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
