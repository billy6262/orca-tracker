Day report: Some
Js and Ks rocketed down Haro Strait
this morning to meet up with other whales off False Bay. This afternoon
all of J-Pod, the K12s, K13s, and K14s, and the L12 sub-group
headed north past Lime Kiln between

4:15-
5:00 PM
. Shortly thereafter, the L12s split off and came slowly back south, making little to no progress against the strong flood tide. When I left Lime Kiln at

6:30 PM they were still milling offshore
. These Ls used to be such a mainstay on the westside during the summer, but it was my first time seeing them this year! It was great to see them, and to meet little
L121
for the first time. -Monika Wieland

Spirit (L22)
spyhopping tonight up near
County Park
, foraging with her son,
Solstice (L89)
. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

5:58 pm - Orcas on Orcasound
hydrophone now. -Patricia Prochaska

We had members of
all three Southern Resident pods here (J, K, and L)
, and I was able to see all four new calves all in the same hour! Not only did the
L12's
return, an independent matrilineal sub-group of
L Pod
, but all of the orcas were incredibly social. L41 Mega born in 1977, babysitting his sisters calf, L121 off South Beach, SJI. The first thing we witnessed when we got on scene was none other than L41 Mega (the oldest SR male) spring into a full breach- twice! The vocalizations were incredible. -Heather MacIntyre
*
A spectacular afternoon watching & talking whales with my grandson from
South Beach & Eagle Cove
. I think Granny &
all 3 J pod babies
were out there this afternoon. (confirmed) From shore, we could see salmon jumping too, hope all the orca ate well! Wonderful, many surface behavoiors, continual sightings from about
1-
3:30pm
. Treasured memories with my 2 generations. And I encouraged calling the Whitehouse for breaching the 4 lower Snake River dams, to family, friends, visitors! -Caroline Armon
*
We encountered members of
J11, J16, J17, J22, and J19 matrilines crossing Haro Strait
. They were primarily traveling, the hydro was quiet when dropped by the boat. Many spyhops and aerial scans. -Connie Bickerton

Calypso (L94), Cousteau (L113), and a spyhopping L121
