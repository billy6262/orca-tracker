Orca Sightings for August 20, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Spent this morning with the
T10 group
which is mom and her two adult male sons,
T10B and T10C. T10B
is such a large and incredibly beautiful male orca. We watched them hunt several seals
near Darcy and Little Darcy island
today in British Columbia. -Traci Walter

10:50 AM -
From cabin at
Land Bank watched 3 TBigg's/Transients
(later ID'd as
T10 and her sons T10B, T10C
) moving steadily northbound west of
mid Haro
. For a short period I timed their surface and down times: surface time avg. 1.5-2 minutes; down times avg. 3-5 minutes. They were visible to us until they were north of Kelp reef marker. -Alisa, ON

8:00 p.m. -
spotted
three harbor porpoises
just south of
Elliott Bay Marina
heading west. Noticed them because we could hear them coming to the surface to breath. One followed the sail boat and swam just under the surface so that we could identify the grey top and white underbelly. Not close enough to see any unusual markings or gender and no photographs unfortunately! -Casey Herron
