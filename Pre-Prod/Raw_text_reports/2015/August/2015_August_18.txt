8:55 p.m. -
Spotted a pod of around
6 Orcas off the Bremerton ferry terminal at tonight riding the Bremerton - Port Orchard foot ferry
. They were slowly heading toward Gorst along the PSNS navy yard waterfront. The skipper of the vessel said he thought there was a baby among the group. It was becoming dark so could not take a phone photo or identify markings on the dorsal fins. They were about 50 yards off our port beam. The skipper put the vessel out of gear and drifted to allow the pod to pass our position heading SW toward Gorst. I have lived in this area 60 years and have never seen an Orca in this area before! - Rick E Stingle

Absolutely unreal evening on the water with
Js, Ks, and Ls
: Big groups of active whales slowly moving north near Open Bay on Henry Island in flat calm water with evening lighting - can't ask for better than that! At one point the
J16s
unexpectedly broke off and fanned out through all the boats watching -
J42
Echo turned on her side as she passed along Serenity, then surfaced right off our stern! It was very special to be able to share this experience with my mom and my niece, too. We left them this evening off
Spieden
heading slowly north at

7:30
. -Monika Wieland
*
Late afternoon - The
J16s
were toward the front of a very large group of whales,
reportedly around 60 SRKWs
. Families were very intermingled, and many individual members tended to just kill time playing in front of the lighthouse and in the kelp beds on the north side of the lighthouse while they waited for other family members to catch up. The entire passing was at least an hour. Magical. -Ariel Yseth
*

5:35 p.m.
VERY LOUD and active
vocals
on

5:15 p.m. VERY loud and active
calls

vocals
on

Hearing them on the
hydrophone
! -Shelby Hight Fifield
*

4:00 pm -
northbound pass-by at
Land Bank
including a breach, a couple spyhops, and some above water vocalizations. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

4:00 PM - From Land Bank
, northbound whales. Amazing experience watching from the bluffs as they streamed by in large groups, stalling out in a line stretched from south LB
to Lime Kiln
, each group engaging in much surface activity (spyhops, breaches, tail lobs, tactile behaviors) and even heard above surface vocals on two occasions. Stunning! As is usually the case, this whole big beautiful clan of orcas was led by J2 (by a lot) who was more inshore than the others. The
J16s
were in shore as well but this pass
J26
was well ahead of his family traveling along with the leaders. -Alisa, ON
*

1:00 p. m. -
We were watching whales at
Land Bank
thinking they were coming north, heard a blow to my right and the
Ks and Ls
blasted south past Lime Kiln. Wasn't even expecting them. Saw the L4s, L92, K13s, more offshore. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

1:00 p.m. -
from middle
Land Bank
we watched northbound whales coming from the south. Around

1:30
they were nearly even with us when Sara heard a blow, we looked to the north towards Lime Kiln and were surprised to see a whole bunch of whales coming our way. A very sweet surprise to watch these southbound whales
(K13s, and some Ls
) pass and meet up with the northbound group just south of us. They all then continued on their way to the south. -Alisa, ON
*
Good morning! Photos will never be able to do justice to some of the stuff we witnessed on the water ...Not only did we have orcas screaming down the four foot wake of a huge freighter for over 20 minutes (I have NEVER seen anything like it! RAW power!)...Then later caught up with the
J16s
and other orcas who were in quite the frisky mood - we watched the new babies catch "rocket rides" off the foreheads of adults - too funny! -Katie Jones
*
...we also had a
humpback outside of Friday Harbor ALL day, three more humpbacks down near McArthur Bank
. (AND a DOUBLE breach). -Katie Jones
*
Sending you a short video my husband Don Kernan made of the Grey whale. We named her "Sunshine " for now, she or he has been here at the
Sunshine Coast
(north of Vancouver BC) for many weeks now. Location Snicket park, Sechelt BC, Canada. -Cornelia van Berkel, Sechelt BC.

transient (Bigg's) orcas stalk and chase Pacific white-sided dolphins
