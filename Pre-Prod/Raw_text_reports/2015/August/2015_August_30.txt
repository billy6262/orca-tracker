Orca Sightings for August 30, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:30 p.m. -
Another stunning evening in
Haro Strait
with members of all three pods in phenomenal, constantly changing lighting. I missed some but I think all of
Ks and Js went north
. More than I thought are here! Saw
L84
too. Left them almost at Turn Point northbound spread all the way across Haro Strait. -Monika Wieland

Today was spent with many members of all three pods! Whales everywhere in all directions! I rarely ever spend any time with
L pod
, so that was a nice treat. There was a lot of socializing going on and the whales were just milling about off Hein Bank.
J46 Star
(born 2009) surfaced in front of mom
J28 Polaris
(born 1993),
J36 Alki
(born 1999) and her son
J52
(born 2015). In one large group, there were 4 whales hanging out with just their rostrums above the surface and there were some above water vocalizations at this point. There was some snuggling going on and it was a precious moment to watch. A pair showed off some seriously awesome synchronized tail lobbing. Lots of kelping! Today was my first real chance at getting some kelp shots! It was surprisingly beautiful on the water...today the family joined so I'm really glad we had such an encounter with so many whales! -Rachel Haight

Trip report: The weather cooperated yet again, and the report was
Resident killer whales near Hein Bank
!! We headed past a seal haulout with a few pups still hanging out, then onward to Hein bank where we found members of
all THREE resident pods
- with beautiful calm seas - and unbelievable magnificence as these whales, spread out over several miles, graced us with their presence. Members of J-pod, including
Granny, K-pod (K-16 Opus (born 1985, mom to K35), and L-pod
, whales seemed to be all over the area. What a treat. After reluctantly heading homeward, we had harbor porpoise swimming very close to us, another treat. Amazing day, again! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

11:30 a.m. -
Had an amazing day on a tour in the Salish sea! Saw
orcas and a humpback
! There were SO many orcas! Looked like multiple pods! Here's my favorite photo from the day! We were in the middle of the
Strait of Juan de Fuca in between Sequim and San Juan island
! We were with them for an hour or so and when we left they were still there. We were told there were two different pods. The whales were spread out but there had to be 20 or more of them. A couple babies, and a couple really defined males. They were all very active spy hopping, cart wheeling, and breaching! It was breath taking! -Grace Seidel

Last visual on one male who was mid channel guy, he surfaced still mid channel
Kingston/Point Wells
(tank farm) transected, still northbound. Shallow surfaces.

south of Kingston
.

7:30 p.m. -
spotted an adult male northbound at
Jefferson Head...Kitsap side
. -Alisa, ON
*
Our

5:30 p.m.
ferry departing Bainbridge Island just got cut off by
a pod heading north back towards Bainbridge Island
. So lucky to have been standing in front of all the cars on the floor deck with my two young sons and husband and we actually saw them before the captain of the ferry did and had a chance to cut off his engine. They casually came right in front of the ferry, to the great delight of everyone that caught a glimpse. One of the calves was with this pod, though I have no idea who they were. Awesome experience- we were about 20-30 feet from them and exactly on their level. -Chelsea Morgan Ramsey

5:13 p.m. -
Just spotted again from an Argosy tour,
between Blake island and Bainbridge
. Northbound. Too far to identify. -Cameron Quinn

My aunt just saw an orca on the southwest side of

*

11:00 a.m.
- Boating south around east shore of
McNeil Island
, saw pod of 8 orcas (including 2 males) due west moving SSE on starboard side. -Matthew King
*

10:00 a.m. - Pair of mature Orca
, a large young bull and a female, nosing around the seals on the beach at
Cutts Island
. Presumably transients. Hunting but didn't observe any feeding. -David Paly
*

8:58 a.m. -
A little bird tells me that there is a large male off
Raft Island/Allen Point (Henderson Bay, Pierce County)
right now...there isn't much more bay north so he would probably have to head back southbound soon. -Aaron Hart
*
We received a call reporting
5-8 orcas plus a calf in front of Rosario Resort in Eastsound from

5:00-
7:30 p.m
. "It was quite amazing and unusual to see them in Eastsound".
*
These
orcas
were viewed from our deck just south of
Rosario Resort
in the
Eastsound at around
5:00 pm
. -Larry & Janet Munson
*

2:00 p.m. - Humpback in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
more towards the Port Angeles side but in between Victoria and Port Angeles. We stayed with it for probably 30-45 minutes. We saw it come up 4 times, the first splashing it's large fluke in the water! It appeared to be hunting, doing mostly short shallow dives and couple longer 5 minute dives! At one point made its way over to our boat before doing another deeper dive! -Grace Seidel
