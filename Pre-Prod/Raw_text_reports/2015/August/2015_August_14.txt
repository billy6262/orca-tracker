Orca Sightings for August 14, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Was it curiosity or compassion? I believe we witnessed Orca compassion for humans today! My husband and I noticed a sailboat with a tall mast pull into Eagle Cove for safe harbor during unexpected lightning. The two people on board anchored the boat and took their dinghy to shore. The lightning passed and the couple returned to their sailboat. We watched closely, ready to help them if needed. Once they climbed aboard,
five adult whales and a baby surfaced right next to the sailboat
, first port side, then again starboard and a third time at the front of the sailboat, like "Come on, its okay now, follow us"! The larger majority of the pod was far off shore while this tight group hugged the shoreline and swam north
past Eagle Point
, the sailboat carefully following their lead. Whether curiosity or compassion, it was amazing to witness their exchange so very close to shore! -Lodie Gilbert Budwill

EPIC day with
J2 Granny, L87 Onyx, J14 Samish
,
K26 Lobo
and then some. Just off
Burrows Island/Fidalgo Head
...so no more than 45 min. from leaving the dock! A rainy (yeah rain!), gray day, but really beautiful, and no other boats with us! Every behavior, tail slaps, multiple breaches and spyhops, family groups, close encounters, even a sea snake from one of the young ones! -Bonnie Gretz

7:20 pm -
Just saw a pod of
5-6 orcas
(including 1-2 adult males) at the northern entrance of
Active Pass
, they came from Strait of Georgia. Did a spy hop by green channel buoy, then hung out around the mouth of the pass. Appeared to be hunting in kelp a little bit. Then they all surfaced to breathe and disappeared. Not sure if they went in the Pass or not. Saw them from the ferry. -Roland Flutet

My son, John Price of Seattle, was
on his way to Poulsbo
Friday,
August 14, aboard his 58 foot wooden boat Shadow when he was treated to a show by
a lone Pacific White-sided Dolphin
. It was at
8 pm just off Point Madison
. John was traveling due West at 8.5 knots. -Christina Price
