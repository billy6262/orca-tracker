Jesse Huggins of Cascadia Research viewed the Twitter video which unfortunately cannot be linked here: "Definitely a Lag (Pacific White-sided dolphin), but I couldn't say with any certainty if it is one of the two loners that have been in the south Sound....would be good if one of them decided to head north though, maybe meet up with other Lags next time they are around the San Juans or something!"

Day report aboard Mystic Sea: We motored up in
between Lopez and Blakeley Island
, moving in an out of the fog and sun, with a few reports of two humpbacks out in a fog bank toward Victoria. Moving through Cattle Pass, the sun was out, but as we searched in vain for the humpbacks in a heavy fog, reports came in of
two to three minkes feeding off Salmon Bank
. We did get some nice looks at the minkes feeding through the bait balls, and also saw magnificent Stellar Sea Lions on Whale Rocks. One highlight was seeing two tufted puffins, as they are scarce in the area these days. On the way back to port, two bald eagles were spotted. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
