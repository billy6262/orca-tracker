Orca Sightings for August 11, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
, and stayed for a couple of days. There are
two adult females in these groups who are nursing calves
...We watched them two nights in a row (Aug 11 and 12) as the orcas hunted the waters around the
Cactus Islands and Johns Island
(north of San Juan Is.). They would go up very close to the rocks and take their fill of harbor seals. Last night I lost count of how many harbor seals they ate! It was inherently sad to see the seals fighting for their lives, but predator/prey dynamics is an important aspect of behavior to document and record. The circle of life must continue! It was great to see the very young calves learning new lessons from their mothers. And, it's been even better to resight the new calf that I had found this spring when it still had fetal folds on it:
T036A-3

About

5:30 PM to
6:05 PM
, there were many
orcas calling loudly on the Lime Kiln hydrophone
! I heard echolocation, some
S1s
, a couple
S2is
, perhaps a few
S16
s, and many
S36
calls. From that, I think I can conclude that members of
J and K pods
were in the vicinity of the hydrophone. -Joshua Glant

7:07 pm - J group A with J2 Granny, J41 Eclipse
came
up island and went back south past Lime Kiln tonight
. -Monika Wieland
*

6:28 pm
- not talking,
singing
! And they still are. so beautiful!

5:39 pm -
They are
talking
loud on
Lime Kiln
right now! -Jean Karlsson

We had a fantastic visit with the
J16 sub pod
late afternoon near
Eagle Point
. (San Juan Island)
J52
spent most of his time entertaining himself with lots of rolling around, lunging, and multiple spyhops! During several of his spyhops he would have various seaweeds in his mouth.
J36, and J42
were nearby, but he seemed to be most playful when he was by himself. -Bart Rulon, naturalist aboard Island Explorer 3
*
Today was hard to describe. We ventured out to the
Race Rocks
area near Victoria, BC where we encountered
J's and some K's
. The lighting was so incredible with flat shimmery water with layers of the Olympic mountains in the backdrop. The whales were mostly slow, but incredibly social. -Traci Walter
*
Spent a good amount of time observing
J51
. Looking healthy and full of energy today. Spyhops and breaches. We encountered them off
East Sooke Park
heading East at 8 km/hr. Two resting periods were observed. -Josh McInnes
*

6:50 am - Gray whale near Second Beach, Stanley Park, Vancouver BC
. -Greg Doughty
*
We observed this animal this evening
off Bainbridge Island
. We can't figure out if it is a dolphin or porpoise. It had some grey markings on the fin. We never saw the underbelly. Today we say a very large seal - larger than we usually see - also off Bainbridge. -Kathleen and Julie, Yeomalt Point, Bainbridge Island
(
Notes from Jessie Huggins, Cascadia Research: This is a Pacific white-sided dolphin; it looks very similar to one that Dyanna Lambourn photographed near Steilacoom in late June but from these photos I am not able to confirm that it is the same individual. It is difficult to compare the still photos to the video taken by the tugboat captain, but given the location I think it is likely to be the same one that he had recently seen.

Entry 2:
We spent the evening watching the sunset on the
west side south of Lime Kiln
. With perfect timing in the fading light, a pod of
~15-20
passed over the course of nearly an hour. This was the most magical sunset of my life. (And when I talk about babies on the video it's because I adore orcas and get more excited about them than puppies, not because all the orcas were juveniles. We did see two very young ones alongside others, though. -Kathleen Love

Transients in Admiralty Inlet
this evening were ID'd by Josh McInnes as
T046, T046D, T046E, and the T046Cs
...Hope they're still around tomorrow! -Renee Beitzell
*

7:35 pm - 4 orcas between Useless Bay and Hanville
. Played around for about 30 minutes then south. Don't know which pod but 1 with a large dorsal and two with small dorsals. -Chuck Clark
*

7:00pm -
Found them closer to the
Whidbey side at Useless Bay
, they were making a kill when we arrive and now they're just milling (

7:20 pm
). Group is split up. There were split up but just starting to come together as we had to leave. Probably 6-7 animals. Possibly T037 in there- working on IDs from photos. -Renee Beitzell, Chilkat Express
*
Our neighbor spotted
3-4 orcas
milling about and generally heading south in
Useless Bay/Admiralty Strait
in the shipping lanes. They were milling around for an hour or so (

6:30-
7:30 pm
). The Edmonds jet boat that goes to Canada stopped and watched for some time (the whales swam up very close to the boat; the boat went dead in the water and just observed). One large ?male plus 2-3 smaller ones. They are too far away to ID. But, we rarely see whales from the Whidbey side of Useless Bay so this was a treat. We lost them as they moved south of the Point No Point Lighthouse. -Linda Ridder
*

3:40 PM - Pod of 5 orcas
seen heading south off
Bush Point, Whidbey Island
, traveling then stopped to feed. -Scott Doyle
*

1:40 pm -
(same?) Pacific White-sided dolphin from the other day. Hanging with us on our way to
DuPont (WA)
. South end west pass. -Johnny Tugboat
