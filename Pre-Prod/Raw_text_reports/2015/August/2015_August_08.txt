Just wanted to share some photos with you of my encounter with the
T37A's
, we were in
Boundary pass
and it was
2:15pm when we got on scene with them. The hunting portion of the tour was at the end of our hour with them so it was around
3:30 pm. It started out very relaxed as they traveled along together. As we were about to leave for the day they decided it was time for a snack and Harbour Porpoise was on the menu. This Harbour porpoise looks to be either a neonate or a late term fetus. Just another example of the circle of life in the wild. I also got a shot of one of
T37A's
calves bellies. I believe the calf is
T37A3
, which looks to be a boy, with
T37A2's
dorsal fin in behind. I am fairly certain of the ID but would only hazard to say that I'm 90% sure. -Ashley Keegan

Resort Marina, Haro Strait. -James Mead Maya

2:00 pm -
An hour before the waterside ceremony to honor the orcas stolen from
Penn Cove
45 years ago, there was word of orcas in the cove. This pair came quickly porpoising across the cove from west to east, eventually heading all the way out and
back south into Saratoga Passage
. How special to have whales visit on a day like today! -Rachel Haight
*
Transients went north past Lime Kiln lighthouse at 1200
. -Monika Wieland

Sending you some pics of a
Grey Whale
. It seems she or he has been going back and forth feeding between
Gibsons BC, and Sechelt BC
on the Sunshine Coast Canada. It has been two weeks, and so close to the shore, it has been so magical! -Cornelia van Berkel
