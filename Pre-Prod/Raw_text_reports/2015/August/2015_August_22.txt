L54 and her calf L117
- Look who finally showed up on the
west side of San Juan Island
! The
L54's, L88 and L84
have been seen out in the Strait of Juan de Fuca several times this summer, but Aug 22nd was the first time they have been in the inland waters this year! -Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
*
Phenomenal morning with nearly all the members of the Southern Resident Community -
only the L12 sub-group
was absent. Yep, the
L54s finally showed up in Haro Strait for the first time this summer!
It took me a few minutes to believe my eyes when I saw these big boys -
L88 Wavewalker and L84 Nyssa
. -Monika Wieland

9:10-
10:00 a.m.
- From the rocks at middle
Land Bank
we watched whales coming from the south, spread out far and wide some in very large groups. We could tell there were a lot more
SRKWs
than had been around the past week.
All of J, K and Ls (except the L12s)
in big groups spread out northbound. Gorgeous morning watching from shore these magnificent traveling with a purpose, north. Short time later I was out with Orca Behavior Institute assisting with the hydrophone while Monika collected behavioral data. We first spotted some of the leaders (J pod) in large family groups in Open Bay. Profoundly moving to be in the presence of them, in their world, watching them travel so closely connected and in sync. Sweet surprise when a short time later realized we were also in the presence of the
L54s

August 22 Notes:
Two groups
were reported through out the day in
Puget Sound
area. Based on sightings times, it is believed the
Saratoga Passage pod turned up into Port Susan
and later moved down
into Possession Sound
. And the Admiralty Inlet group moved southbound into Puget Sound making their way to
Tacoma
before flipping and traveling back north)

Another windless day and we were fortunate to find
both minke and humpback whales
- so easy to find in mirror-like sea conditions. First was a minke feeding near
Smith Island
, then on
Hein Bank where we found "Split-fin", a well known humpback whale
. He appeared to head straight towards the boat (most likely passed under us) and gave incredible views as he fluked heading right towards us!...(Minke report)...and then - in Rosario Strait - another humpback! No ID on this one, but a delight to see. Such a spectacular day again. -Jill Hein
*
Spent this morning with the
T10
group which is mom and her two adult male sons,
T10B and T10C. T10B
is such a large and incredibly beautiful male orca. We watched them hunt several seals near
Darcy and Little Darcy island
today in British Columbia. -Traci Walter

From cabin at
Land Bank
watched
3 TBigg's/Transients
(later ID'd as
T10 and her sons T10B, T10C
) moving steadily northbound west of mid
Haro
. For a short period I timed their surface and down times: surface time avg. 1.5-2 minutes; down times avg. 3-5 minutes. They were visible to us until they were north of Kelp reef marker. -Alisa, ON
