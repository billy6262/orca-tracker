============================================================

Entry 1:
9:43 p.m. -
I just got home from the park. I heard
blows at 9
in the darkness after sunset and I'm
hearing whales on LK
! Ls I think. -Barbara Bender
*

9:14 p.m. -
Squeaks on
Lime Kiln hydro
if you can stand all the boats too. -Shelly Shima Cordis
*
We watched
L119 and L77
torment a neonate harbour porpoise near
Salmon Bank
for an hour west of Salmon Bank before they moved on to join the rest of their pod at north Hein Bank. -Mark Malleson
*
A close pass from
J- and K-Pods
of the endangered Southern Resident Community of killer whales, right off the rocks at
Lime Kiln Point State Park
on San Juan Island in Washington State. Js and Ks went north, Ls got to land bank and turned south- looks like everyone's still here. -Monika Wieland, Orca Behavior Institute

9:18 a.m. -
Just turned volume back on, not sure how long but echo and
calls on Lime Kiln
. -Alisa, ON

Wow! Just spent an hour with so many whales!!!
At least 40 whales went by Eagle Point from

8:00 -
9:00
. They are still in view nearing
Pile Point
(southwest San Juan Island). Breaches, tailslaps, kelping, up into the rocks on shore, sea-snakes (! ) . So amazing. -Jenny Stands Wilson

Heading out of Roche Harbor into
Open Bay
(Haro Strait) to circle
Henry Island
....We moved our kayak as close to the cliffs and in the kelp as possible to be out of their way and stopped paddling while we watched them in Open Bay -Michelle Feis

Here are a couple of pictures from my experience with the
T37A, and T65A pods
. I started with them at the
north end of Lopez Island
and when I arrived there was a distinct smell in the air as if they had just made a kill.
T65A2
spent a lot of time upside down attempting to get frisky. They swam southward along the western shoreline of Lopez Island, then
out Cattle Pass
as a tight knit group. Next they tucked inside the rocks and kelp and aimed toward Long Island. At the east end of Long Island they finally made a kill on the edge of the kelp, then they breached and played around for a while, followed by a session of logging at the surface as if to decide what to do next. They turned around and pushed offshore aiming
toward Smith Island
as they spread out into smaller groups at sunset. -Bart Rulon
