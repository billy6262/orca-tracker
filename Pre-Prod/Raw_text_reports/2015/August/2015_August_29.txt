Orca Sightings for August 29, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today with
L-Pod in Haro Strait
- I've never seen L's this active! Breaches and more breaches, spyhops and more spyhops, with a bit of belly-flopping, tail-slapping, and cart-wheeling, too! -Michelle Rachel
*

10:00 a.m. - Three Orcas, two male and one female passing Eagle Cove
in the wild waves heading
south in Haro Strait
and moving so fast against the wind! They each breached numerous times. Same group was swimming together Friday evening as well. -Regina Feinberg
*

9:37 a.m. -
The pod came closer to shore, turned and now swimming north,
foraging off Eagle Point
.

8:49 a.m. -
What a difference a day makes! The whales came by Eagle Cove last evening gliding through the glassy water close to shore. The conditions so calm and still, their exhales echoed loud and clear across the water. Wake up this morning to stormy skies, heavy wind and major whitecaps all across the strait. Far off shore I see huge splashes! The whales were porpoising over and through the whitecaps, breaching again and again, the wind carrying their splash high up into the air!

8:30 -
they were
headed Southeast towards Salmon Bank
. -Lodie Gilbert Budwill

4:00 a.m. -
Woke to the canary-type
calls on Lime Kiln
. I heard them for over 40 mins. Ls? I recorded it. Very odd to hear those whistles and nothing else the entire time. -Barbara Bender
*
T046E near Race Rocks
. -Mark Malleson
*

11:18 a.m. - 2 heading west past Lime Kiln
.

11:11 a.m. - At Lime Kiln
the last 15 mins, heading east now. Moving fast. -Michelline Halliday

2:02 p.m. -
In
Case Inlet between Olman Point and Treasure Island
--several adults and two juveniles. -Carolyn Treleven
*

12:21 p.m. -
Seeing pod of
Orcas in Pickering Passage
across from Harstine Point Marina. -Miche Ennis
*

12:50 p.m. -
Looks like they are headed
up Case Inlet to North Bay
or will they trick us and circle Harstine Island and head toward Olympia. Spotters on the shore up and down Pickering and Peale passages.

11:55 a.m. - Orcas heading out of Hammersley
. Waiting to see if they turn toward Olympia or Allyn.

10:02 a.m. -
They are moving up and down the inlet (Hammersley). From Walker Park down to Church Point and back. Thanks for the map addition. -Bivalves for Clean Water
*
Noon
: We saw
maybe 5 orcas
(I think 2 males, a female w/ baby and one other) in front of our place is the narrow part, and deep channel, in
Hammersley Inlet
. (Shelton) Neighbors in a wider place say they were playing (?) So I just saw them traveling by. -Meg Callea
*
Noon: Orcas just passed under the Harstine Bridge
and moved north in Pickering Passage, heading towards Jarrells Cove. Peaceful, gentle sight. Nice to see them without a dozen chaser boats. -Gretchen Stewart
*

9:30 a.m. - 4 in the group (including one calf) at Hammersley Inlet
. -Barbara Andrews
*

9:00 a.m. - Four or five orcas in Hammersley Inlet
just east of Shelton this morning. At least two large males and two or three others. -Thomas Pearson
*

7:30 a.m. -
We just saw
three or four whales
off
Arcadia point
this morning, they were approximately 15 feet offshore. It was amazing. -Cheryl Cerkan
*

7:00 a.m. - In Pickering passage woke up to 4 Orcas
slapping their tails heading south towards Olympia. There was one big one and one little one. All 4 were close to shore. They stopped slapping their tails once they got past our home. -Diane Sushak
*

6:45 a.m. -
this morning
four orcas spotted coming south through Pickering Passage
. Tail slapping and jumping completely out of the water! Beautiful! I thought the neighbors were putting their dinghy or kayaks in the water and making a lot of noise until I looked out onto the water. -Christy Rowe
