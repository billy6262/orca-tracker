Orca Sightings for August 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Chasing transients from shore requires enormous amounts of patience. Today, I caught up with the
T046s
. It seemed like they were
angled straight for Penn Cove
just before
1pm
, and it was at that time I lost sight of them. Never did find them again. However,
5.5 hours later
of basically nonstop looking, I was able to find
T049A2
(the same whale from my close encounter a few days ago) as he entered
Penn Cove
heading west. After a close pass by shore, I completely lost him AGAIN. I figured I'd ought to check the mussel rafts, and when I arrived, I saw several seals tucked in close to shore who appeared to be watching something. A few minutes later, I heard that telltale blow. I watched this
lone whale travel back and forth in between the mussel rafts
for 1.5 hours before leaving due to the darkness...It was also quite the sunset too! -Rachel Haight

5:47 - Two orca just leaving Penn Cove
...dream fulfilled, watching orca standing on my deck! No time to run down to the boat ramp. I just caught a quick look as they were a bit east of the ramp, heading east. It was awesome! The closest I've ever been!! -Bonnie Gretz

This is the orca that was in

today. Came up about 10 ft off the beach at
Long Point

Still here!! Came about 40 yards from shore at one point! Beautiful orca! The lone orca
