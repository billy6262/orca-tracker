, One of the group of four was a male and they were patrolling the shoreline between two groups of seals approximately 400 feet apart. This activity was on the north side of

9:18 a.m. - Five Orcas
hunted seals near shore in a meter or less near
Eagle Island Seal Haul-out in Balch Passage
. The large male several times approached the colony which numbered between 80 to 90, with many pups. The Orcas remained in the area near shore for approximately 10 minutes. I did not see the initial strike but from the splash the orca apparently came out of the water. -Paul Proctor
