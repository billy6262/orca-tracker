Orca Sightings for January 3, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Had a short but amazing encounter with
transient orcas
just before sunset! It was the
T060's and T002B in Harney Channel
(between Shaw and Orcas islands) and they ended up making a kill right off the stern! Good amount of blood in the water and some remains (looked like lungs) sank beside the boat. I could even see bits of meat in the mouths of the orcas as they swam past! Pics and GoPro footage will be posted soon! -Melisa Pinnow

10 in total
...This picture is just after a kill with "intestines" still dragging on fin... -Sooke Coastal Explorations

Orca in Henderson Bay
. Video by Christie Fierro. Several hours edited into a few minutes. There are breaches at
2:05,
2:40,
3:17, and
4:11 There is tail slapping at :23,
1:14, and
2:18 There were
Dall's porpoises
in the bay also. I am not sure if they were playing together or maybe the orca were hunting the porpoise. After studying the fins closer, I suspect this is a transient orca pod (the meat eaters). But, I am not sure. -Christie Fierro

T068C
with seal entrails draped over dorsal fin on
January 3rd off of
Sooke
. Paul Pugwell of Sooke Explorations and I came across the
T068C's
in Sooke Basin west bound on
January 3rd. The T077's along with T075B and T075C were a couple of miles to the south of them also traveling west. -Mark Malleson, taken under permit #MML-001
