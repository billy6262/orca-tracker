Orca Sightings for January 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the previous update (Thursday,
January 8),
J27 (and the rest of J pod) were heading south in the northern Strait of Georgia
. They
made a beeline for Puget Sound
arriving in there late Friday afternoon. Using the satellite tag location information we were able to anticipate their location on Saturday morning and readily locate them
off Elliot Bay
as they moved north. This allowed us to observe
J50, who was with J16
. We were also able to check the tag attachment on J27, which is holding as designed. In addition, we were able to collect several predation samples and fecal samples from the whales. By
Sunday, the whales were off Victoria
and as of
this morning they had reached the western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
.

I spotted
3 orcas at
5:20 pm
today just west (up the beach) from
Puget Marina, 4181 Walnut Rd. Olympia
, 98516. They were
traveling southeast
towards the
Nisqually Reach/ River basin
.
Lat - N 47 degrees 6' 44.7501" Long - W 122 degrees 47' 41.6913"
They were traveling fast, 2 out in the channel and one cut in towards Salish sea inlet - then all three converged not 100' away from me and played for a couple minutes (awesome) then headed on towards the mouth of the Nisqually River. About 20 minutes after they left me I heard seals barking from the Nisqually Reach area - never heard that before! One was definitely bigger than the other two. And the fins were small and fairly sharply pointed. Definite large white eye patches. I'm assuming they're transients? Saw 2 (I think, could have been three but definitely 2) orcas in the same strait headed the opposite direction Dec. 25th around
3:30 pm. But too far out in the channel to see any particular markings. Would love to know more about who's who and where! -Cate Montana

10:30 AM -
Sighting in
Hammersly Inlet
. We saw a group of
four to six
travel out of the inlet this morning - missed them coming in. At times there appeared to be as many as six whales, including calves. -Jana Walters

11:11 am - Oakland bay
in Shelton WA. -Linda Ellwanger

John Gor called with a report of
orcas in Hammersly Inlet
(west end of south Puget Sound), headed west at about 5 knots
toward Shelton
, at about

8:45 am
.

Around

8:20 am
we saw
2 whales in the Sooke area
just off East Sooke point. I missed them coming in really close but managed to get these 2 not very good shots. Friend said it looked like one large and one small whale, maybe Mom and young. -Cedona Holly

We encountered
T11 & T11a this afternoon just west of Otter Point heading west
. They were harassing an adult harbour seal for almost 2 hours whilst we were on scene. -BC Whale Tours
*

7:30 AM - A pod of 4 maybe 5 orcas entered Totten Inlet
. They were porpoising as they went into the inlet. One hour later they were seen exiting Totten inlet and near the point of Steamboat Island. Feeding. They were visible for about 4 minutes going into the inlet and the same coming out of the inlet an hour later. -Stephen Hicks
