Orca Sightings for January 6, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
noon
- I saw
a single dorsal fin of an Orca from the Purdy Spit bridge
today . Someone told me they saw porpoise in the area, but what I saw was a huge dorsal fin in the air for several seconds. Lot's of fog, and I was in a moving car so that was all I saw! -Midge Patten
*
Approx.
1430 - Orcas sighted north of Florence
. My wife and I watched a huge pod of Orcas feeding north of Florence today. At we counted
as many as twelve
with several little ones. Feeding, coming completely out of the water. -Gary Songer
