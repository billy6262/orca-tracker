Orca Sightings for January 4, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Erica at the Pt. Townsend Marine Science Center called to report
2 orcas in windy Admiralty Inlet
off the PTMSC at
4 pm
foraging, maybe headed south.
*

3:30 PM -
I spotted
three orca whales out in the water of Case Inlet in Allyn
. There were many seals out at play today on the water and once we spotted the orcas, the seals had disappeared. I had never seen orcas out on the water here before; it was so awesome to see! The three whales surfaced for air, blew up some water and were gone. The seals were out playing and after we had spotted the orcas the seals disappeared. -Nona Nelson
*
Orcas Case Inlet
. We saw a pod of
5-7 orcas
at the north end of Case inlet (Allyn). We watched them go up to the end of the bay then turn around and go back. There was a much larger one with the rest being noticeably smaller. They were traveling with some activity that looked like they were feeding or trying to "corral " something, but seemed unsuccessful. -Susie Ingham

1:30 -
Steve McCoy called with a fresh report of about
five orcas deep in Case Inlet
, between Vaughn and Stretch (Treasure) islands. At one point the orcas were within 15' of the beach, at other times breaching out in deeper water.
*

12:30 PM - Orcas entering Discovery Bay
. Saw four orcas heading into Discovery Bay,
one large male, two females and one juvenile
. Not long after saw harbor porpoises leaving the bay. -Rich Kiepke
It's not known if these were Transients/Bigg's whales or Resident orcas
.
*
5 orcas... 4 adults and 1 juvenile
... Sighted at

9:45am
from the ferry between
Lopez Island and Anacortes
! They were heading west toward the Lopez ferry terminal. -Jenny Jirsa
It's not known if these were Transients/Bigg's whales or Resident orcas.

8:45 AM - 2 Orcas in sight at Boston Harbor
, 100 yds south of lighthouse, 100 ft offshore, traveling. -Stephanie Smith

My wife and I saw
a pod of mammalian creatures
on Sunday, Jan. 4th, approx.

4:30 PST
about 1 mile north of Sea Ranch Lodge (straight out from Navigators Reach,
50 miles north of San Francisco
), roughly 0.5 mile off shore. The pod was slowly swirling in an amorphous group further out to sea and southward. I would suggest
our identification of these creatures as orcas is not terribly reliable-perhaps 20-30% likelihood at bes
t. My wife and I have seen orcas in captivity (and in film ;-) and dolphins many times in the wild and captivity. We never saw a nose or side of these animals which would have provided more information (e.g., bottle nose of a dolphin or white patch of an orca). The primary reason we considered orcas is that the animals and their dorsal fins seemed too large for dolphins. The only coloration we observed was grey, however. The dorsal fins were on the large size but had a nicely defined curve to them common to dolphins and uncharacteristic (as we know it) for orcas. To us, "bottlenose" seems to be the most likely explanation, if it's plausible that so many of the individuals would be on the large size. We can not provide an accurate total count because the animals were in constant movement and never surfaced all at once. Thrice a group of 3-4 surfaced together (in close proximity to each other) and 2 or 3 surfaced over the next few seconds but in more dispersed locations. The total population was at least 6, perhaps about 8, but could even have been more. Warren Gish
