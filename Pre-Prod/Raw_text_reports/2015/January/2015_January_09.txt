J50 to visit Seattle
. After touring Georgia Strait for the past week, J pod is now headed toward Seattle to show off its new baby, J50, to the city that was built on the shores of Puget Sound in 1852, and named in honor of the First Nations Chief Si'ahl (Seathl) who famously spoke of this beloved environment now tattered and occupied by more than 5 million people. The whales are really the First Nations to use this environment, long before the arrival of any humans, and we should respect that they are the ultimate icon of the Salish Sea web of life. Give thanks that they are still able to come visit us, and live life in such a way that future generations of both whales and humans can visit one another as they have done for thousands of years. Respect them,... they are still our iconic totem species, and the world will not forgive us if we do not care for them. - The Center for Whale Research
