Orca Sightings for January 24, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Late afternoon/dusk, a group of around
8 Orcas swam south between the west side of Saltspring Island
and the east coast of Vancouver Island. They continued slowly down
Saanich Inlet
(no outlet) towards Brentwood Bay. There appeared to be one, maybe two, juveniles in the group. -Marg Woolley

I work as Quartermaster on the
Bainbridge Island/Seattle Washington State Ferry
. This afternoon, on our east-bound
1405 departure from Bainbridge to Seattle
we spotted
a breaching calf
. This was directly east of Eagle Harbor, directly on the eastern edge of the north-bound ship traffic lane (roughly centered between West Point and Alki). I initially spotted the calf about 2 miles directly east of our position. We reduced all power and came to a stop (on the east edge of the northbound shipping lane).
The calf continued toward us until it came within about 200'-300'
of our bow (breaching all the way!), then turned south (towards Alki). No adult whales were present, which is fairly disheartening (as is the fact that a very young calf is in Puget Sound this time of year). We had no further sightings of the calf for the remainder of our watch. The calf was approximately 15', a long narrowing head (not bulbous like a gray), a swept back dorsal fin, and long white-ish rough edged pectoral fins. -Gordy Pine
