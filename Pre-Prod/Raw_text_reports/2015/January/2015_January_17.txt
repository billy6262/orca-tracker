Orca Sightings for January 17, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
17 January update - On the previous update (Thursday, 15 January),
J27 (and the rest of J pod) were off the northeast corner of Texada Island
in the northern Strait of Georgia. By Friday morning
(16 January) the whales had traveled north to just south of Campbell River
. The whales then turned south such that by Saturday afternoon
(17 January) the whales were off the south end of Texada Island.

9:18 AM - Single baby or juvenile whale
sighting in front of our home this am 200 ft off shore,
between Yukon Harbor and Manchester in Port Orchard
across from Blake Island. The whale surfaced several times blowing, rolled to side surfacing with fin for at least 15 minutes; we've lived here 10 years, this is first whale sighting. We frequently see seal and sea lion; I am fairly certain what I saw today not either. Seal and seal lion surface frequently near our shoreline however the blowing and rolling behavior does not fit with what we normally observe. I did take pictures with my cell phone but quality is very poor. -Sandy Ringstead
