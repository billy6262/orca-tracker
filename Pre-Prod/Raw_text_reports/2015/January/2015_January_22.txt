Orca Sightings for January 22, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whale under downtown Seattle at Colman Ferry Dock. GRAY WHALE UPDATE: Today, the necropsy team determined
the gray whale found beneath a Seattle dock
died from being struck by the propeller of a large vessel. The juvenile female, likely two to three years old and just over 30 feet long, was in very good condition before its death, with thick blubber containing healthy amounts of oil, the examination found. Biologists are not sure why the whale entered Puget Sound since most gray whales have already migrated south along the outer Washington Coast by this time of winter. Large, deep gashes on the whale's right side and back indicated that it was struck by a propeller and likely died quickly, probably within an hour. The time of death was estimated as no earlier than Monday and most likely on Tuesday.
