Orca Sightings for January 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
While prawning near
Flora Island at the southern end of Hornby Island, 12.30 pm,
I had the pleasure of watching a group of
transients, 6 or 7
in number, including one juvenile, moving in on the 250 or so Stellers and California sealions that were either on shore or swimming in close proximity to the western side of Flora Island. From a distance of approx 250 meters offshore, the whales were spyhopping and slowly swimming back and forth. They then moved in underwater and rushed the sealions in the water in shallow water next to the Island. Pandemonium! But I didnt see a kill. Shortly afterward, 4 or so animals headed south-but two remained behind. Preparing for another rush perhaps? I was back in the area today, and there was no sign of the orcas. Hope this helps. -Bryan Allen

4:28 -
They are past
Point No Point, still heading north
.

3:57 - See them from
Point No Point
! Way out mid channel in heavy fog. The weather may not have been ideal, but I am grateful to have had the pleasure of meeting and waiting it out for members of J pod with two lovely people who were seeing orcas in the wild for the first time, and witnessing and sharing in their sheer elation. What a happy day! - at Point-NO-Point beach. -Gayle Swigart

I LOVED that I FINALLY got to see them with my eyes and that's what was AWSOME! -Becky Newell Woodworth

The NOAA boat is about 2 miles NW of here. Just barely visible with naked eye. Over the last 45 minutes they have slowly been
moving north

Not 100 percent but think we may have seen
J50 off Edmonds
oil docks this afternoon...(look closely just before dorsal you will see small orca beside). -Toby Black
*
So very sweet to meet the weeks-old baby
J50 traveling with her J Pod family
for probably her first time into Puget Sound. J pod came in through Admiralty Inlet and
at dawn were seen around the Seattle
area of Puget Sound traveling northbound. I waited for them a bit north and filmed them from Richmond Beach and Edmonds, Washington.

3:03 -
we leave watching NOAA turn
northwesterly
as if with couple of trailers
towards Admiralty
. No definitive on that as visibility cruddy. We hope Point No Point peeps get to see them. Beautiful misty foggy day with that little girl and her family.

2:05 -
whole bunch of us at
Edmonds Marina Beach
watching
J50
pass
northbound
! The whales are very spread out across the Sound from well east and west of mid channel still traveling northbound.

1:20 -
2-3 individuals well east of mid channel
northbound
with NOAA. Saw couple more mid channel. Nearing
Richmond Beach
which is good spot for now then
Kayu Kayu
which is on map.

12:55 -
finally seeing one on this crappy weather. With NOAA east of mid channel due
west of Carkeek
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

J50 at Kayu Kayu park
. J Pod passed by
Kayu Kayu Park and Edmonds Marina Beach
, with
J16 and J50
staying on the East side of the channel, showing off the new baby! -Janine Harles
*
My family finally caught sight of them from the
Edmonds Ferry Dock Public Fishing Pier around 2PM
. They were closer to the Kingston side of the channel but were visible at times with the naked eye. I counted three and possibly four Orcas at once, one Harbor Seal, and one Bald Eagle. This was our first attempt to see Southern Residents and are so thrilled with the results. Very awesome (grainy) shots of new baby and presumably momma? Thanks to many for their help today. -Rae Rome
