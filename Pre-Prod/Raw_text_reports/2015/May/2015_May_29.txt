At least
two transients
(I saw two bulls for sure, though there may have been a third cow) did a close swim-by of
Ogden Point here in Victoria
today around noon! I managed to catch up with them just off of
Oak Bay Marina around
1:45pm
before they carried on towards the San Juans from Chatham Island. Not the greatest photos but it was certainly a thrill to see them! -Michelle Rachel
