Sighting Solo Point
. We were out filming the Oil Rig protest in Seattle, when we returned home to
Steilacoom
we ran in to
a pod of about 20 Orcas
. We took a bunch of still photos and were lucky enough to have one battery left for our DGI Inspire Drone (cutting edge drone) and took some awesome drone video. I cannot post the done video on here but after editing we can get it to you. FYI we could have gotten much better Drone video but we wanted to keep our distance. -Christpopher Cardillo
