Orca Sightings for May 23, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here is
T101A and T124C
traveling together on
May 23 in the
upper Gulf of Georgia
...And
T077A and 102
traveling together same day as they headed South... It's amazing to me to see how far they are traveling during their time in our waters. Then we have gangs like the 002C's who spent over 2 weeks up in our area recently never seeming to move more then 40 miles a day. -Nick Templeman

... morning near
Salmon Bank
many members of
Jpod
were foraging and socializing and among them was
Hy'shqa (J37) with little J51
swimming in her slipstream (mama Eclipse (J41) was close behind). As soon as there was even a little bit of room
T'ilem I'nges
was smooshing himself between the two and took his place in her slipstream as if to say "This is MY mom! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
J Pod
today at the
north end of San Juan Island
. Hy'Shqa and T'ilem I'nges. -Connie Bickerton
*
Today was an amazing day on the water. We saw
all of J pod
, including all the babies, off the north end of SJI slowly heading north. I was able to finally get a picture of Granny, and much of J pod popped up right next to the boat. It's experiences like that you'll never forget, when you see these massive animals surfacing just feet away from you. It's then that you can truly appreciate their size and beauty. Hearing them breathe is the best sound on earth. Wild and free, as it should be. We left them about 7pm I believe. -Rachel Haight
*
J-Pod passed Lime Kiln heading north at
3:30!
-Monika Wieland

J27 Blackberry

. -Michael Gallagher

I watched this wonderful interaction today from shore. A couple kayakers were trying their best to get out of the way but there was wind and current.
J52
decided it really, really, really wanted to take a close look at the kayaks. Mom (
J36
) instantly cut the kiddo off, and even though the kiddo tried to wriggle over her again, mom blocked J52 again this time pushing the calf pretty much out of the water and away from the kayak. And off they went, lesson learned. Pretty funny to watch. It was very clear that she wanted the calf to have no part in these kayaks. -Traci Walter

12:18 pm -
Just saw a group of
whales off the Hood Canal bridge
? Any details? They appeared to us on the left side of the bridge as we were driving over to Sequim from Tacoma. We were driving so didn't get to stop and observe as we would have liked to, but it was clear there were several dorsal fins popping up. (Unconfirmed but sighting of earlier reports and timing makes this possible-ALB) -Amber Wilson

Entry 2:
. The
96-day deployment
exceeded the K25 deployment in 2013 by 3 days and was much later in the year, providing the first satellite-linked tag data for Southern residents for the entire month of April and much of May. With the deployment of the tag on J27 in late
December 2014 and the tag deployed on L84 in February, we were able to monitor the movements of some of the Southern Resident killer pods for nearly four and half continuous months this winter and spring.
On our previous update of L84's movements (11 May) he (and likely at least a few other whales) were off the entrance to Clayoquot Sound. They continued south and on the evening of the 12th had reached the offshore area of the Juan de Fuca Canyon. By the morning of the 13th they were off Cape Alava and our colleagues from Cascadia Research Collective attempted to intercept the whales but were unsuccessful due to rain and sea state. They whales continued south - by the morning of the 15th they were off Cape Elizabeth, off the Columbia River the morning of the 17th, and off Tillimook Head on the morning of the 19th. The whales headed back north such that they were just south of the Columbia River on the morning of the 21st. Our colleagues from Cascadia Research Collective were able to intercept the whales late that day and document L84 in the presence of at least a few other members of L pod. They also observed that the tag was just about to detach from L84 and by 23 May, the next scheduled transmission day, no signals were received. -NOAA-NWFSC, courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging
