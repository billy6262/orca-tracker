It was a wonderful encounter with
T77A and T124C!
Two Bigg's Killer whales (transients). They were being very social together and then a big cargo ship wake came by which they SURFED! I haven't seen that in a while. Then they did lots of tail slaps to celebrate the surfing! -Traci Walter

Another
T77A and 124C
kind of a day, near
Java Rocks, BC.
It is special when you are the first boat to find Orcas in the morning. We left them in the afternoon headed up Swanson Channel. -James Mead Maya

5:45 PM - Possible [humpback] whale near Vashon Island
. Spotted repeated spouts separated by more than a minute from the ferry
between Vashon Island and Southworth dock
. Could occasionally see back of whale with very small dorsal fin break the surface after spouting. After a private motor launch passed its location heading south towards Colvos Passage, the whale began what I think is called lobtailing. The tail and flukes would come completely out of the water, wiggle/wave about, then slap back into the water. It continued doing this at about 1 minute intervals until we moved out of sight. -Patrick Poor
