Orca Sightings for May 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have had unbelievable T encounters the last three days! Large, active groups, three days in a row! There have been over
35 individual Biggs killer whales that we know of sprinkled throughout the Salish Sea the last few days
, the bulk of them traveling in a large group. Wow!! Among them is
T121A
, a whale that we encountered on
May 8th, 2013, which was the first time this lone female had been recorded in our area ever (according the the Center for Whale Research). Cool stuff! -Tasli Shaw
