Orca Sightings for May 15, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
A large pod of
20 or so orcas in Baynes sound between Fanny Bay and Union bay
(NW Georgia Strait, south of Comox).
At least one large male
with very tall dorsal fin. Playing and possibly feeding. Lots of tail slapping. Looked like 2-3 babies. They were in this area for at least 6 hours from noon
till at least
6:00pm
. -Karen Macgruther

A pod of Orca are south bound at Dodd Narrows
just south of Nanaimo at
1347
. 4 whale watching vessels have gathered at the narrows to watch the whales transit the current that is 4.7knots N/B. -Rodney Grounds.

Had several
transient orcas
a few miles of shore off
Depoe Bay, OR
for the whole day. They have recently killed a baby grey whale in the area that washed up on Thursday and they were seen eating a Stellar sea lion yesterday. I have attached some of the better photos of the transients I have from the trip. I would love to help you in any way possible and if you hear of any orcas in the central Oregon region please keep me posted. Thank you! -Stephanie Young
Dave Ellifrit: I'm pretty sure the bull is
T165
. The last pictures I have personally seen of him were from 2007, also off Depoe Bay. In those photos, another kw had raked him good and his fin has drooped a little since then. He wasn't in the last DFO catalog but perhaps he has centralized his range down the coast rather than in inshore waters. I had several encounters with him along with T166 and T167 in SE Alaska in the 1990's with NMML. It's nice to know he's still alive.

10:07 am -
Saw t
wo orcas, going east at Blueback Beach (North Nanaimo, BC).
Traveling close to shore for a short time. Then headed out when I lost sight of them. Only saw them for short period before lost sight of them. First time the orcas were going south, every other time they've been heading north. -Pat Beaton
