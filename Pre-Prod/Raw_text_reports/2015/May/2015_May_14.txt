Orca Sightings for May 14, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Well, the
biggest group of Biggs killer whales
I've ever seen today!
Identified 27 different whales
today but presumed there was about 32!!! Ok here we go! A few highlight shots from the largest groups of Biggs killer whales I have ever seen yesterday
just off Entrance Island
(8-10 miles NE of Nanaimo). We had the
T23's, T36, T36B's, T86A's, T100's, T101's, T124's and the T124A's

A meeting of the matriarchs ... This was during a large congregation of
Ts, there were at least 25 whales
, likely more. They were split into groups that were roughly organized by age and gender, the adult males (
T102, T100C, etc
) were more-or-less on the outskirts of the entire thing, doing who knows what. There were two groups of predominantly calves and juveniles that were, as to be suspected, pretty bouncy and surface active. Then there was
this main group which consisted almost exclusively of the older females and mothers
. There was a lot of physical contact between them and they were not spending much time below the surface. There was also lots of vocalizing happening. One can only imagine what was being exchanged between them. -Tasli Shaw

We spent the afternoon with the
T124A's
and watched as they made a successful harbor seal kill. Transients aren't always flashy when they make a kill, an often will disperse of their prey underwater. This time, however, they brought the seal to the surface before the "degloving" process started! The seal is below the orca, you can just make it out! -Heather McIntyre
