Good evening, It feels great to finally report some orca calls after such a long absence! I emailed you over a year ago, but since then I have become a full-fledged (pun intended) and obsessed birder, and have been neglecting orcas a bit recently. Well, no more! A bonus is that my birding practice has honed my ability to identify calls, something that might help me during hydrophone sessions. I navigated to the hydrophone site by accident at

10:20 PM tonight
, and decided to have a listen. Boy, am I glad I did!
S1 calls
all over the place, with some
S4s
mixed in too, and a few
S2s
here and there. Sounds like
J Pod
is spending the night in
Haro Strait
, or at least passing through! I got a nice 5-minute recording. -Joshua Glant, Mercer Island, WA

Orca sighting
- Little Skookum Inlet

east of the Narrows
traveling eastwards with the falling tide, just after the peak of high tide, presumably on their way to Totten Inlet. -Ed Huber
