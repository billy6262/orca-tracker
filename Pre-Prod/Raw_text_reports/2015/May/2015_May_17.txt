Orca Sightings for May 17, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were killer whales everywhere in the Salish Sea yesterday! Residents and transients ... We ended up spending time with
J Pod
and were fortunate enough to encounter these individuals:
J16/50, J42, J14 /45, J34/38, J19/41/51
. J41's mother, J19 Shachi, was always extremely attentive to her and I suspect this is part of the reason why J51 seems to be doing so well thus far. He's got a great support system. -Heather MacIntyre

8:49pm -
They're baaaaaack! Heading up (
San Juan) island
now...

9:49am -
Black n whites right outside
Eagle Cove
! -Erin Corra
*
Lots of whales today... A number of transient orca, including our old friend Chainsaw (
TO63
), made a foray through the whirlpools and swirling currents
into Deception Pass
before separating later into northbound and southbound. Those northbound had a hard job bucking the 7-knot current and eventually took the easier route out
through Canoe Pass
, while southbound whales headed towards
Saratoga Passage
. A rare treat to see so many transients together socializing and hunting with some full breaches and tail-slaps thrown in for good measure. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist/Author
*
Just spent 3 1/2 hours watching the
large group of Ts
playing in the same spot in
Penn Cove
that I saw earlier under the Deception Pass bridge. It was amazing and made better by sharing it with some good friends and many new whale watchers! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

8:30 pm -
Just a handful of pictures of the large group of
transients who had been in Penn Cove for at least 4 hours
and still in the same area where we left them at dark. First time seeing
Chainsaw
! Plus, they were very active, lots of tail lobbing and breaching. Beautiful day!

1:09pm -
Watching orcas from on top the
Deception Pass bridge
. Dreams do come true! -Rachel Haight
*
Transients were in Penn Cove all afternoon at least until dark about
8:30
, roaming unpredictably but mostly in the same general part of the cove, just north of the mussel rafts except a brief visit to the
Captain Whidbey Inn by T063
. They were in small groups or singles, seemingly meandering, each surfacing headed a different direction. Gradually they became more active, slapping the water and dive-bombing, probably on seals. -Howard Garrett
*
7 pm -
Trisha Silvera called to report
4-5 orcas in Penn Cove
.
*

7:30 PM -
Sighting in
Penn Cove
. A pod of
Orcas with 2 males and 3 calves
by the Penn Cove Mussel rafts. 2 males. -Linda Noack
*

4:30 to 6+ pm - Orcas in Penn Cove
. Appears to be 2 pods of about 4 each,
maybe @ 6 total
in Penn Cove after coming by Coupeville Wharf - now near Shellfish rafts!!! Am sitting on bank of Penn Cove on Madrona across from house at 1849. They were closer to Coupeville Wharf about
4:30, then headed past the OC Shellfish rafts & now closer to Capt Whidbey. Could be about 8!! -Vicky Reyes.
*
We were out at
Penn cove
Crewing for the Schooner SUVA, a vintage all teak 68' Ted Geary designed Schooner built for Frank Pratt (An important person in Coupevilles/Island County's history). When after wrapping up the schooner for the night a Pod of Orcas came through... Probably looking for a seal a meal :) It was a fun day so I thew this together to share and remember the fun and the whales :)

5:45 -

T49A3 breaching along Saltspring Island
. -Tasli Shaw
*

8:22pm -
Pod of about
10 orcas
heading south, mid channel between
Meadow Point and North end of Bainbridge
. Must be residents, there are seals and porpoises nearby who don't give a damn. About 6 in the first group, looks to be a calf among them. Another 4 or so bringing up the rear. -Ben Blankenship
*
App. 9 orca in Penn Cove. 2 males
. We watched until nearly dark, there appeared to be feeding, from the red that showed in the photos, most likely on seal they stayed in the same place circling, lots of tail slapping. -Sue Owner
*

5:18 -
Group of
orcas in Penn Cove
heading towards mussel beds. -Susan Green Lee
*

5:16 - Orcas deep in Penn Cove
NOW! Never thought I'd say this, but taken from
Deception Pass bridge!
They were trying so hard to move west against the current and never getting anywhere. Then, suddenly, they turned and went out the smaller Canoe Pass, and I didn't get the shot of them under the bridge. But, still amazing to see! -Rachel Haight
*

7:00 PM - Whidbey island
sighting,
Penn Cove west of mussel rafts. 9 or more whales
. Two adult males and two very young babies. -John Burns
*

5:10 pm - saw 3-4 orcas
, one was very large
heading into Penn Cove
. Last saw them shortly after 5 around the Coupeville dock but haven't seen them since. Don't know if they went into the cove or back out to the sound. -Carla Peterson
*
At approx.

2:00 PM
, we saw an
Orca Pod
with a number of whales about
two miles south of Deception Pass in Skagit Bay
. They were heading south. -Jim Chicatelli

"My FIRST time to see
Chainsaw
! Taken from 'land' at
Cornet Bay
11:30 this morning
. This group was last seen
heading south towards Polnell Point, approximately
1:30 pm
. -Jill Hein
*
11 am -
We got a call from Dave Anderson saying there were orcas off
Mutiny Bay, south Whidbey in Admiralty Inlet
, headed south. Sure enough we saw them about 5 miles south of us. The only other report of them was by Ben Blankenship, above, and the IDs or ecotype of this group is still unknown. -Howard Garrett
*
T123's and T049A's
treat weekend campers at
Ruckle Park, Beaver Point on Saltrspring Island
as they cruise along the shoreline. -Mark Malleson
*
I came across the
T049A's and T123's in Satellite Channel
on my way home from Saltspring Island. I left them
traveling north along the south side of Saltspring Island at ~1500
. -Mark Malleson
*
3 pm -
Vern DiPietro saw
7-8 orcas
heading into the
Suislaw River in Florence OR
.
*
Here is some video taken by Lisa Horn yesterday of
killer whales
that were quite a ways up the
Suislaw Rive
r; feeding on something. (They claim that it was the same pod seen last week, with two small juveniles. "They were going towards the bridge, then disappeared for a while, and then they came back up," Horn said. "So it was about all of 25 minutes." Horn watched them reappear on the inland side of the bridge, and then they disappeared before coming back up where Horn caught the Killer Whales on camera. She said she saw them quite a ways up the river, all the way near the Mo's restaurant a few blocks away".
