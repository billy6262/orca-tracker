Orca Sightings for May 28, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We encountered low fog by
Rosario Strait
- and with news that J-pod was back in the area - we headed between the San Juan Islands, and by the time we reached the west side of San Juan Island, the fog was gone - and
there was J-pod!
They were spread out in several groups, and the first group we encountered were the
J-16s with their TWO new babies
. What a thrill for us all. They were heading west, so we turned towards home and found some of the
J17s
, also heading west. Amazing day! We rounded out the day with Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks, harbor seals, bald eagles, oyster catchers, and many other seabirds. Another great day aboard Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
