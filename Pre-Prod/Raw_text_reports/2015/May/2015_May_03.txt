============================================================

Entry 1:
I listened until

10:45 pm
which is when the calls seemed to fade away.

10:30 pm -
Transient orca calls
on
Port Townsend Hyrophone
now! -Justine Buckmaster
*

3:35 pm -
We circled them briefly in the new Wild Orca plane, still in the same spot. -Sandra Prow
*

3:05 pm -
They're back at the rocks now and the direction is uncertain.

2:52 pm -
They are off of
Snake Rock, Port Ludlow
right now near the cluster of boats headed back towards the rock. -Kelly Lauricella
*

2:25 pm -
Joe Langjahr called reporting the orcas off
Port Ludlow
are still in the same location, south of
Snake Rock and north of Port Ludlow
, close to the shore. He says at one point several of them were hanging vertically upside down, heads down and flukes up. No direction of travel.

12:40 pm -
Jim Ferrara called in about the same pod around
Snake Rock
. He counted
six orcas
.

12:30 pm -
A pod of
about 5 orcas is circling Snake Rock
, just outside Port Ludlow in Admiralty Inlet. They seem to be checking out the seals and sea lions hauled out on the rock at low tide. -Lori Hanson.

We saw a pack of
3-4 smaller orcas in Port Ludlow
this morning. They swam all the way into the bay and very close to shore. It was pretty cool to see! -Jackson

Such a lovely day on the water again. We spent the afternoon with a
Humpback whale named "Windy" up in Boundary pass
, the area that separates Canada and the US. -Traci Walter, Western Prince
