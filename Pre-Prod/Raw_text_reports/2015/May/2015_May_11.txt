Orca Sightings for May 11, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca watchers, here's a few more updates on tagged orca
L84
. As of the last update on 30 April L84, and at least a few other members of L pod, were
off Willipa Bay
heading north. By the morning of 1 May, they were off
Grays Harbor
and continued north, reaching mid-continental shelf west of
Destruction Island
by the afternoon of 2 May before turning south. By 3 May, they were off
Grays Harbor
and the morning of the 4th the found them off the middle of the
Long Beach Peninsula
, where they turned north. L84's transmitter again changed to an every other day duty cycle on 4 May to save power such that the next transmissions on the morning of 6 May showed the whales northwest of
Cape Alava
. By the morning of 8 May, the whales had made a big jump north to the continental shelf break
west of Estevan Pt. on central Vancouver Island
. By the morning of 9 May, they reached the northernmost point of this excursion - they were still on the shelf break about 25 km
south of the Brooks Peninsula
, which is about
3/4s the way up the west coast of Vancouver Island
. By the morning of 11 May, they continued south, moving more inshore and were at the south end of the entrance to the
Nootka Sound
and by the afternoon were off the entrance to
Clayoquot Sound

Saw some
Orcas
pass by the tip of
Steamboat Island
! They went from Totten up to Steamboat and then we lost sight. They were on the Arcadia side of the bridge/island. We were standing under the bridge and lost sight as they went up the island. -Kim Warner Hildenbrand
