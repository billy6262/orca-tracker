Orca Sightings for May 1, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
So there we were, getting a look at Windy (the
humpback
) for the first time this year when all of a sudden the
T65As and T65Bs
came speeding (make that racing! high speed porpoising!) from the distance straight toward Boiling Reef and the Steller sea lions that haul out there. T65A2 and T65B were over half a mile in the lead and got to the unsuspecting raft of sea lions first, and the rest of the whales were porpoising out of the water at high speed, apparently swimming as fast as they could to catch up with T65A2 and 65B and join in their hunt. They successfully managed to separate a sea lion and proceeded to take turns ramming it and fatiguing it to the point where after 45 minutes the sea lion bobbed at the surface one last time and all the whales disappeared underwater. They milled around, presumably consuming their kill, for over an hour. The gulls moved in, along with hundreds of Bonaparte's Gulls which made for this overwhelming scene of whales breaching and tail slapping with hundreds of birds swirling and dipping around...it was chilling to see that sea lion fight for its life but fascinating to watch the calculated way the whales handled it. T65A, 65A2, and 65B did most of the work, taking turns rushing the sea lion, while the younger animals waited on the sidelines. The younger whales almost seemed restless at times, vocalizing at the surface and rolling over each other and at times circling in close to the sea lion with the adults. I've never seen a kill on a large mammal take place from start to finish. It was a privilege. -Tasli Shaw

10:24 am - 5-6 orcas off of South Finger Island and Johnson Point on Sucia Island
. They were either playing or hunting as they were tail slapping and porpoising frequently. They didn't seem to be traveling in any specific direction. Saw them when we were leaving Sucia Islamd, it was certainly an amazing way to end our 5 day camping trip! -Jennifer Smith

Our incredible encounter with the
T65A's and T65B's
hunting a Steller sea lion at
East Point (Saturna Island)
! -Gary Sutton

J41 Eclipse and her less than three month old son J51
this
afternoon off San Juan Island
. -Monika Wieland
*
What a day! All three of the new J
Pod calves, 50, 51 and 52
. We were so enjoying seeing moving up the
West Side of San Juan Island
toward Henry Island. Then all of a sudden they turned and came toward us. We suspect we were between them and some salmon. We got baby mugged! Especially interesting was seeing the scratches on J50 and being able to get close ups. -James Mead Maya, Maya's Legacy WW

5:15-
5:30 pm -
I saw a group of
about 7 off the SW shore of San Juan Island, north of American Camp
. They were very close together, bobbing up and down, then going underwater for a bit. I lost them (I'm watching from a rental house on shore) when they continued south. -Christy Avery

4:25 pm -
Four passes by the
Light house
so far- with babies! -James Taylor

1:30 pm -
Still some faint
calls
, but far and few between. -Casey Fitzgerald
*

12:10 pm -
hearing
J pod vocals
and echolocation on
Lime Kiln
. Great whistles and S4 calls. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
We had Southern Resident Killer Whales in inland waters for more days in the month of April (14 days) than in any other year since 2007. -Monika Wieland
*
Called in by Jake Hylaema from the USCG, who watched
a male orca come into Grays Harbor
this afternoon, mid channel between the jetty tips, a hundred yards into the channel when he disappeared still headed up the channel.
*
A good start to the month - 'Mystic Sea' spotted
gray whale #22
among the whitecaps heading towards
Gedney Island from Everett
. By the time we circumnavigated Gedney she had changed direction and was going in the opposite direction towards the delta. Hopefully she's still finding plenty of food here. -Sandra Pollard
