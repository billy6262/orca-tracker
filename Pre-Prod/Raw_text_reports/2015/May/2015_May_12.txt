Orca Sightings for May 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:50 pm - (Puget Sound) orcas
were on south side of
Harstene Island
heading toward Dana Passage. Long, deep dives. Have since lost sight of them. However, I have 2 frisky seals and 4 harbor porpoises right in front of my house. So they've not picked up any "threat" at this minute. -Kim Merriman

1:40 pm -
We counted
6 or 7 orcas in Totten Inlet
directly in front of my house. They swam and dived, blowing loudly, between us and Scukum Inlet in Totten Inlet. We thought they were feeding, although the gulls were not around, so they may have been playing. They are traveling north now out of this inlet. -Lynette Schurman

Noon - 4 or more Killer Whales
back at
Carlyon beach
(NW of Budd and Eld Inlets) right in front of our house. This is the 4th time in the last week and a half. -Wendy Jewett

11:00 am -
Whales (assuming same pod-
T65As
) are back in
south Puget Sound
, heading north out of both
Budd Inlet and Eld Inlet
. Continued north toward Squaxin Island. Traveling with long, deep dives. -Kim Merriman

Today, we had
two transient killer whales, T093 and T097
. They were in
Rosario Strait
headed north initially before looping around and heading southwest again. They made a couple kills. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
