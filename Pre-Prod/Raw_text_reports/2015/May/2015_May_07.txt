Orca Sightings for May 7, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the evening of
May 7th some friends and I were able to head out to the tip of
Cooper Point
to watch the
T065A matriline
exit
Eld Inlet
from shore...The five of them were making their way out of the inlet at a medium pace, with a few surfacings followed by a deep dive that would last a few minutes. At one point, one of the kids did a funky tail slap that created a good splash, but other than that the orcas were in travel mode. They were aiming for Squaxin Island as they slowly disappeared from view, their loud exhales still audible. -Melisa Pinnow

7:00 pm - Transient Orca Pod
sightings in front of my home. I spotted and took pictures of
3-4 Orcas in Eld Inlet
at around
7pm
. Pod included a calf. Traveling very fast past my house. They were not feeding. I do have many photos to share so email me if they all don't appear in this report and I'll send them to you. -Kristin Boberg Susalski

Just saw several
Orcas in Clallam Bay
(Strait of Juan de Fuca, about 20 miles east of Neah Bay) from the Celebrity Solstice. -Stephen Allmendinger

Scrumptious evening with the
T49As and T49C in Boundary Pass
. -Katie Jones
*
The
T123s
have been spotted in
Howe Sound
once already this season and we suspect they were there earlier this week as well based on reports of "a group of three whales, one bull and one baby". Interesting that they have been seen up there at least twice in the past month, yet another sign of increased Biggs killer whale sightings in the area. They are a welcome addition to such a beautiful place and a hopeful sign that the Sound is becoming productive enough to support them and their prey ... at least for now. -Tasli Shaw

at
Carolyn Beach Marina (right next to Steamboat Island) in south Puget Sound
