My wife Michelle and I spotted
5 orca
heading north up
Pickering Passage
between Orchard Beach and Harstine Island. They seemed to have 2 little ones with them. The two little ones and an adult swam together and two others swam about 100 yards away from them. They dived and surfaced for about 20 minutes, and did not leave the area for that time. -David Callan and Michelle Hipskind on Orchard Beach, Grapeview, WA.
