Orca Sightings for June 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:17-
9:55 pm
-Thanks to Connie Bickerton for alerting me the
T65As
had exited
northbound Agate Pass
(west side of Bainbridge Island) Once I arrived at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park (Shoreline) I immediately spotted blows across Puget Sound in the north end of Port Madison near Indianola. The pod then turned south directionally towards Bainbridge Island. I lost them for a bit and short time later (
8:45) I spotted them to the south porppoising towards Faye Bainbridge park. At least one made it to the park while the others hung just to the north lazily circling. I thought they might be on a kill but a short time later they all huddled up, turned and began traveling at a steady pace northbound, which they continued into darkness. With just enough light lingering, I last saw them
passing Appletree Cove, Kingston still northbound at
9:55 pm
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

7:45-
8:30 pm -
Spent all day trying to find the Transients reported in the
Bremerton
area. I was waiting for them at
Old Man House in Suquamish (Agate Pass)
, and was getting ready to give up, when I took one last look around - and there they were. It was quiet, and I could hear them breathing - the most perfect sound in the world. At
7:45 hey passed me at Old Man House in Suquamish heading east, a boat came in very respectively, but they dove and disappeared. About
8:00pm they were hugging the north shore and it looked like they found the Harbor porpoise, then I lost them again. At
8:12 they appear to be heading east and north. Perfect conditions. (ID'd as
T65As
. Connie's photos included in
June 14 report) -Connie Bickerton

4:26 pm - Orcas are now straight across from Illahee
. Headed toward Poulsbo slowly. I didn't see them again after I posted this. They went under and I'm not sure which direction they went! -Megan Rogers

A glorious day with
Ts in Admiralty Inlet
from the north end of Marrowstone Island to Pt. Wilson at the north end of Admiralty. Several probable predations were followed by exuberant breaches at all angles and tail slaps right side up and up side down and other contortions followed by directional swimming, followed by a disappearing act, rinse and repeat. -Howard Garrett

I was in my son's small boat in
Dyes Inlet
today when the
Orcas
passed us. There were
5

they went past my sister's house
between Illahee and Bainbridge Island
going toward Brownsville. -Debbie Hinds

An amazing day in the NW. We were awoken as the ferry went by the house and we heard the captain announce on the PA that there was a pod of orcas approaching. That's all I needed to fire up my spirit. I spent the day in bliss following 3 adults and 2 juveniles as they toured the area. -Larry Sagan
