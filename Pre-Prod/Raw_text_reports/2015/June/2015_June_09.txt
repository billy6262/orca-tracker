A group of

. Here's T137 and her kiddo, T137D. The Ts grouped up together as they pushed offshore in the late afternoon light. It was striking. I later saw them from shore at Washington Park as they continue north towards Bellingham Channel before I lost sight of them. -Sara Hysong Shimazu

There have been
four Orcas in Hammersley inlet and Oakland bay
at various times of the day, both early morning and mid afternoon. One has a high straight fin with no markings, one has a high straight fin with a notch in the back side about half way down. The third has a fin that curls over to the left at the tip and appears damaged with a notch at the top. The last has a shorter fin with no markings. First sighting of Orcas here in some time. -Thomas Pearson
