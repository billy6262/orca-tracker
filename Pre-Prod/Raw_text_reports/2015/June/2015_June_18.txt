Orca Sightings for June 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Quintessential Pacific Northwestern days to watch the
T065A's and the T077's near Maple Bay, BC
northwestern Salt Spring Island. It was uncharted waters for Captain Spencer and I, but it sure was worth the extra time. Just the scenery alone would have been worth it for me! The rock formations that were shaped by the British Columbian continental ice shelf, and the thickly lined Douglas fir forests that shadowed us the entire way north were beautiful! When we got on scene the
mammal-hunting Transients had already made a kill
and were working on prey sharing the kill. Then they continued south and made another kill, engaging in lot's of social activity! As if that wasn't enough adventure for us, we also went back out on a second trip in the rain and mist to watch a lone Transient,
T049C traveling north just south of Sidney, BC.

A couple of beautiful days with the
T65A's and T77's
. We had them around
Crofton
today and they were moving very slowly and taking down seals every chance they got. It was pretty incredible. -Gary Sutton

Maple Bay, BC...T77B.
It was that kind of a day. -James Mead Maya
