Orca Sightings for June 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
A little bouncy out there today but great to see
group A of J pod in the Strait of Georgia
!
J51
peeking up beside mom and
J49
trailing right behind. -Gary Sutton
*
J26, "Mike"
a split second before his massive pec fin hit the water. Gorgeous afternoon up
near East point on Saturna, BC with part of J Pod
! We spent time with the J16's and J26 "Mike" just couldn't stop doing pec fin slaps! -Traci Walter
*
Tonight we had the most amazing encounter with the
J16's
traveling south through
Boundary Pass
. However, it's no surprise that the one claiming all the attention was none other than little six-month old
J50
. I've never seen a baby orca breach so much!...Her sister,
J42
Echo was also carrying on with her, breaching with J50 as she babysat...Likewise,
J52
has also started breaching and engaging in lots of social activity. Those two are going to have so much fun growing up together. -Heather MacIntyre

Here's a shot of the
K12s
from this afternoon at
Lime Kiln
, when an interesting mix of members of all three pods came by...it looked to be about
15 whales from L-Pod
and I think
half of J-Pod
in there with all the Ks. -Monika Wieland

1:08 pm - A couple Calls on the Orca Sound.

12:15 pm - Hearing loud calls on Lime Kiln.
-Nathan Harrison

Around
8 PM
we watched a group of transients head north in San Juan Channel from Reuben Tarte county park. It turned out to be the
T65As and the T77s
. They turned into
Spieden Channel
and from a friend's house we watched them milling around right off the rocks for almost an hour. They nailed one, probably two, harbor seals in that time. Just as it was getting dark around 10 PM they finally decided to move on, heading northeast out of Spieden Channel. Since it was too dark for photos, I took video instead, and I'm glad I did, because I think it captured the essence of the encounter even better! As if orcas close to shore aren't enough, the background landscape and sunset were the icing on the cake. -Monika Wieland

7:02 pm -
The two I saw (
T128 & T125A
) looked to be angled towards Whidbey Island. I never found T127 or T125 from
Point No Point
. When I saw them from Kingston those two were ahead and closer to mid channel.

6:32 pm - heading north east out of Admiralty
. Just north of Point No Point lighthouse. Only two males so far. Only saw
T128 and T125A from Point No Point
.

6:22 pm -
one just
south of Point No Point
, milling at this point. -Connie Bickerton

4:43pm - T127
passing further out towards mid channel in front of Apple Tree Cove in Kingston. -Connie Bickerton
*

6:24pm -
watching one staying in pretty much in one spot, southeast of
Point No Point
, east of shipping lane.

6:09 pm -
cruise ship past one just barely to the west of the orca. Looks like another orca in the lead. Point No Point (Kitsap) people should be seeing soon! -Stu Davidson
*

4:55 pm -
from Edmonds Marina Beach seeing blows just
north of Kingston
, still on Kitsap side of channel. They are grouped in twos a little spread out continuing northbound at a steady pace.

4:33 pm -
I moved north to
Richmond Beach. 4 orcas
. I can tell it's
T127
. Chunky disfigured dorsal. 3 males, one female. Just south of Kingston, on the Kitsap side.

3:45 pm -
Picked up a
2nd and possible a third male
that looks to have a dorsal like T127.

3:00 pm - from Carkeek Park (north Seattle) I see one male mid channel
moving steadily northbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

2:55 pm -
Albert Furst called from inside E
diz Hook at Port Angeles as he watched 4-6 orcas
churning up the water while apparently catching a seal about 100 yards off the beach and 1/4 mile or so inside the hook.
*

1:30 -
Maia of WA State Ferries reports
one or two orcas in the traffic lane between Bainbridge Island
and Seattle, heading east.
*

7:25 am -
I'm watching
2 orcas from Luhr Beach
boat ramp. They are off the
mouth of the Nisqually
. A male with a notched fin (brief video clip showed T127-ALB ) and a smaller (female?). Heading north towards Steilacoom. -Chris Warlow
