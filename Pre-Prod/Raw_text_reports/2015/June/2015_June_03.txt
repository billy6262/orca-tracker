Great day (and even better evening) spent with the
L4's, L47's, and L95 Nigel
! They were very social tonight, as opposed to this afternoon where they were very serious about foraging. It was lovely to see them socializing before sunset. So grateful to have seen some of L Pod today, it's been a while. -Heather MacIntyre

12:38 pm - Off Pile Pt and Hannah Heights following Nigel, L95
, and two more whales. Possibly Fluke and Racer? -Chris Grams

Surprise!
L-Pod showed up on the west side this morning!

June 3rd is the same day the first Ls came "in" last year, too. Here's
L27 Ophelia with L82 Kasatka - L116 Finn
was with them too. It's just like catching up with old friends to see these guys after so many months! -Monika Wieland

Very unique
T encounter yesterday. At least 20 whales
, including the exotic
Ts and fan faves T65As and T137s. PLUS!!! The T124As, T86A1, and T100B
. Their behaviour was very cool and perplexing. Social milling is the only way I could describe it. They barely moved a quarter mile the entire time we were with them, they were basically all in one clump, but not necessarily touching each other like you might expect from social KWs. Very little surface activity like spyhops or tail slaps. They were just spinning around each other in a big clump. Maybe somewhat of a cautious greeting/inspection toward the T125s? Lots of playful speculation that the ladies were drawn in from far and wide to meet these handsome strangers from Alaska to help maintain a strong gene pool down here if you know what i'm saying~ -Tasli Shaw
