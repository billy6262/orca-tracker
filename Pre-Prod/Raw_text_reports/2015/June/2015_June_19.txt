Sucia Island

With beautiful
T065s and T077s just north of Sucia Island
. Lots of breaching, tail slapping, baby activity (the calf (ves?) was small but not tiny. Never never get tired of seeing these beautiful orcas! -Bonnie Gretz

On Friday we saw the
T065A's who were still traveling with the T077's down Rosario Strait
. They were being very sporadic, zig-zagging as they hunted for marine mammals cooperatively in the straits. The T065A's are the "social butterflies" of the Transient orca community. It's so interesting to see who they've team up with day to day! It was also nice to see the T077's since I haven't seen them much! -Heather MacIntyre

Another fantastic encounter with the
T65As this afternoon
. This fun little family group rarely disappoints. They are always up to some kind of antics. When we first arrived on scene with them, they were heavily harassing a harbor seal with the help of another family group, the T77s. They could have easily eaten the seal at any moment, but instead decided to play with their food - not unlike a cat with a mouse. It may seem cruel and it can be hard to watch these sorts of interactions, but it is necessary for the younger whales to learn hunting skills and techniques. After they were finished with the seal, all kinds of other above-surface antics commenced. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
