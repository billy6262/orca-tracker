J2 (Granny) and her granddaughter J14 (Samish) in the lead this morning at
9:15
at the Center for Whale Research, heading north a mile
north of Lime Kiln park
. They were spread out for miles. The J
16s didn't pass Lime Kiln until
10:30

We've had a week of amazing mornings on the water and today was no exception. We met up with
J-Pod Group A and the K12s, K13s, and K14s at Pile Point
heading north at
8:30 AM. They were very spread out; by the time we left them at 11 AM the leaders were well north of Kellett Bluff and the trailers were off San Juan County Park. -Monika Wieland, Orca Behavior Institute, San Juan Island, WA

We found those amazing
T075s
today - here's a photo of T075B with calves T075B2 (left, born in April) and T036A3 in back.
Between Waldron Island and Doughty Point, Orcas Island
. Lots of breaching, and they had seal for lunch. -Jill Hein,

It's been a crazy few day's lately! On Sunday we saw the
T075B's
play with a harbor seal, carry it around, but not eat it! These Orcas have been notorious lately for playing with their harbor seal prey. -Heather MacIntyre

I spotted a group of
three orcas in the San Juan Channel
near Mineral Point around
11am
traveling north
toward Waldron
. Looked like a male female and calf but I could not id them. I would be curious to hear if anyone else living on the channel saw them and was able to id them. They were in no great hurry and seemed to be finding food but they were also spyhopping quite a bit. -William Radcliffe
