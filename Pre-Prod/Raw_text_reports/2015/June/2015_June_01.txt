Orca Sightings for June 1, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
L Pod
was reported
traveling South off Blunden Island
(off Tofino BC, west coast of Vancouver Island) around

2:15 pm
today. They were off Wilf Rocks an hour later. Around
4:15 pm they were off Frank Island. When we caught up to them just after 5, they were past Cox Point. Despite their fast travel they were having a blast in the chop and were breaching, spyhopping, tail lobbing and cartwheeling.
L121
was sighted and was even seen in the care of
L41, Mega
. Also identified with the pod was
L25
, the presumed mother of Lolita, who is in the Miami Seaquarium. We left the pod as they reached Long Beach, around
6:20pm. -Marcie Callewaert/VMSC

Photos of
J Pod traveling north through Boundary Pass
, heading for Active Pass. J50 sandwiched in between her sister J42 Echo and mother, J16 Slick. You can really see the rake marks on her tiny little fin here, which is why I cropped it so close. I'm so grateful she survived whatever experience she had to go through to be brought into this world. -Heather MacIntyre

Spent some time with
J pod
in Canadian waters which was very spread out, very choppy so hard to get nice clear shots, but confirmed
J27, J28, L87
...also got 2 babies, possibly J50 and J52....not 100% on that yet. Looks like they were all up there, I think I got Granny, too, she was leading the way with Onyx a little way behind her. -Janine Harles

A good start to Orca Month - off we went to find orca. We traveled in
between the San Juan Islands out towards Stuart Island, and found J-pod!
They were spread out in small groups - our first whales were the
J16's with 5 month old J50
. Even though the seas were a little choppy, we had great views of them, and also caught up with
Granny, Onyx, Doublestuf, Princess Angeline
and many other whales. What a privilege to see these amazing whales, and the light rain we encountered didn't faze our enthusiastic passengers. A great day again. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

A couple of shore based shots from encounter with
J Pod

J16
matriline whales, but pretty cool that you can see these guys up close from the beach! -Jeff Hogan, Killer Whale Tales

I played a hunch today and caught the early ferry over to San Juan Island and caught
Big Mama (see humpback section) and J pod at Lime Kiln
. Then I headed out on the water in the afternoon and saw J pod again. It was a lovely, lovely day---if a bit damp. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
