Orca Sightings for June 4, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were some
orcas just off County Park
(San Juan Island) about +/- 2 Pm. Super pod of J's & L's? -Peggy Strickland
*
1 pm -
got a call from the WA State Ferries of about
6-8 orcas heading west in Spieden Channel
, just north of Roche Harbor.
*
Saw
a lone dolphin
while kayaking at Dick Gilmore park,
Tacoma/Browns point area
around
8 pm
tonight. Very close to the shore. Wasn't very active. Maybe lost/sick. (There have been several sightings of two, and now a lone
Pacific White-sided dolphin
in the south Puget Sound for about a year). -Tim Larson

8:39 -
Headed back north. But still south of
Kingston
. I couldn't even begin to tell you who it was but there was probably
at least 10-15
. I lost them after they turned north.

8:23 - Kingston - Edmonds Ferry riders... Orcas
are on your right! Looks like they're just milling around. Just south of the ferry lane. -Laura Finch
*

8:28 pm - Pod of at least 6
individuals heading generally south off of
Jefferson Point in Kingston
. Going forward, then sometimes heading back close to other individuals. Maybe cruising (or feeding?) -Teri Munter

2:23 pm -
Just saw
a pod of 4+ orcas while on the port Townsend ferry
...Looked like they were headed west, maybe slightly northwest. -Jason Weigner
