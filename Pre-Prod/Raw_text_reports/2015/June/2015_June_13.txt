, L94
.

L25 Ocean Sun is the presumed mother of Tokitae (also known as Lolita) who was captured in 1970 and now resides at the Miami Seaquarium. -Michelle Rachel
*
L121
was tail lobbing like crazy this evening. What a spunky little whale! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

8:06 pm -
started hearing
resident orca vocals on the Lime Kiln hydrophones
- word is it's the L12 sub-group. -Monica Wieland
*

9:45 pm - 2 Orcas just swam by Salmon Beach
(between Pt Defiance and the Narrows bridge) heading north, on the east side...simply stunning! -Asher Beckett
*
Near Sidney Island, BC...T065 and T123 transients
made a kill directly in front of the boat! -Bonnie Gretz
*
Orca in Dana Pasage off Brisco Point, Harstine Island
. A group of
4
led by the male Orca. They were not rushing too fast and seemed to be enjoying a calm, north-eastern trip heading toward Key Peninsula. We are enjoying May/June sightings almost every other day going both South & North. So exciting! -PJ Yocum
*

4:20 PM - Just saw between 3 and 4 Orca traveling north through Dana Passage
heading towards Johnson's Point, consisting of
2-3 adults
and one juvenile. -Erik Anderson
*
3 pm -
In the past hour I have sighted an o
rca whale breaching close to shore in Budd inlet
near Cooper point. -Grace Brewer
*

2:48 - The Orcas have been in Dana Passage
just north of the Boston Harbor Marina for the past couple of hours. I am dismayed to report boats following along side of them with feet not yards and many boats just speeding toward and around them. I think there needs to be some support in the South Sound area for the whales safety and perhaps more awareness outreach. -Greg Bell
*
Saw three of these guys off of
Pt. Wilson, Harstine Island
. This photo was taken at

10:35 AM
. They stuck around for about 15 minutes before continuing south! -Katie Steinhoff
*
I was lucky enough to see what I think were three different pods last weekend off Pickering Rd., across from Harstine Island. -Maria N Chet Nelson
*

12:50 -
Now heading north. Slowly. Along the eastern shore.
At least 3 males, including T127
. Two smaller ones.

12:22 - 4-5 whales
currently heading s. past Boston Harbor Marina toward Budd Inlet. Moving very slowly. At least two large males. I was hoping they had headed out and way north of this zoo area. -Kim Merriman
*

8:21 AM - 1 male and at least 2 female Orcas
traveling westbound near
Ediz Spit
(still east of the spit, the Black Ball Ferry was moving towards Victoria. The pod of whales would have been approximately 1/2 mile east of her starboard side.) Winds were CALM in the area of the sighting. -Tony Little
*

12:25 PM - 3 Orcas mid-channel between San Juan & Vancouver Island
. Mid-channel, west of Smugglers Cove on SJI. Some rolling but most traveling. Three whale watch boats maintaining a respectful distance. One moved well within 100 yard limit. -Debra Westwood
*
7 pm -
A first for us -- seeing a
humpback travel eastward through Active Pass
. -Karoline Cullen
