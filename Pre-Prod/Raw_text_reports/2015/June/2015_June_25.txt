Orca Sightings for June 25, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another beautiful sunny day with the lovely
J-16 resident orca group
and others, around
Andrews Bay north of Lime Kiln state park
. Some great close passes by big Blackberry, J-27, the J-16 group, J-16 Slick, J-36 Alki, and two of the calves,and most likely the rest of the that family group, plus J-19 Shachi and J-31 Tsuchi. Some big breaches, a spyhop, and some intense porpoising and fishing behaviors. Great encounter, with a few bald eagles for good measure! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Being a mom isn't easy, and it must be a little extra tough when you're a first time mom as in the case of
J36 "Alki". Her little boy, J52
seems to be quite the curious little guy and lately I've seen him do all sorts of strong willed behaviors and actively watch mom correct or guide him in another way. He also has some rake marks now, not sure when these happened but it's the first I recall seeing them. These are likely marks from play or even mom making a corrective statement to kiddo. There is so much to learn for a new Killer whale calf, and their mothers are essential to that learning process. J52 spyhopped several times to check us out before mom came by and guided him back to where she was fishing. Beautiful encounter with wonderful evening light! -Traci Walter

We continue to have amazing whale encounters almost every day. Even better, the pod associations are constantly changing so we're getting lots of opportunities to make hydrophone recordings of unique groups of whales. (One thing Michael is hoping to look at for his thesis is how call types change with different social associations.) This morning, however, we had one of more most magical encounters yet. We were off the
south end of San Juan Island with members of J and K Pods.
We were the only boat with the whales in glassy calm waters when they started breaching - 10 breaches in a row by different whales! Photo 300mm zoom and about 100-150 yards, decently cropped here. We were shut down making a hydrophone recording when they started going off breaching. Most whales were about 200-250 yards off but
K26 Lobo
, the whale shown here, came a bit closer. -Monika Wieland

This is
J14 Samish
breaching along the shoreline of
South Beach on San Juan Island
. It was a truly magical morning with glassy seas and orcas scattered everywhere. -Katie Jones

North of Fort Flagler and south of Port Townsend
in ferry lane. -Marilyn Armbruster

1:45-
2:00 pm -
they were in
Admiralty Inlet
heading west at a good clip, Whidbey side,
east of Double Bluff
. -Janine Harles
*

12:35 pm -
I saw breaching and tail slapping a bit north of where I first saw them ( about
3-4 miles south of Cultus Bay
, I think) No general direction of movement, as I see some swimming to the right and others to the left.

12:05 pm -
I see
3 or 4 orcas NW of Edmonds
and east of the shipping lanes. Just milling about. -Sherman Page

Candice Emmons of NOAA NWFSC emailed: My co worker reported
3-4 whales off Mukilteo (no direction) at
10:15
.

10:00 am -
This morning
2 groups of Orcas (3 babies,4 adults in) swam south past the ferry terminal at Mukilteo
. They were fantastic to see. The first group was about 2-3 adults and 2 babies, then a little behind them, another adult with a baby swam past. The ferry was close but they were past before it docked. They were traveling, but not at a fast pace, just up and down. -Susan King
