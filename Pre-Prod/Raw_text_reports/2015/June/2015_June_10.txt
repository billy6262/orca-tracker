Orca Sightings for June 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a female traveling with
4-5 animals
along the
backside of Meares Island (by Tofino BC)
then she showed up again, separated from the fleet. The next morning she was on her own with this calf with a still wrinkly and moderately folded fin. -Rod Palm, Principal Investigator, Strawberry Isle Marine Research Society Photos by John Forde

5:54 -
watched them round the tip of McNeil, heading northwest between Fox and McNeil. Lots of tail slapping, breaching and spy hopping, they don't seem to be in a hurry. They were pretty far for even my 600mm lens, but hopefully someone on Fox can get some lovely shots of their evening!

5:47 -
very close to shore at the
southern tip of McNeil island
, likely traveling between Fox and McNeil.

5:21 -
seem to be heading toward the south end of McNeil, with some nice beaches.

5:19 -
They are moving slowly north, but still on the
north side of Chambers golf course
from my perspective. I have confirmation that they came up the
east side of Anderson island around 4pm, and I have 4
.

4:58 - from Anderson Island, I have 3-6 Orca in 2 groups
on either side of the chambers golf course. One set near a small stationary boat, the others north of that. Seem to be milling with no direction of travel, or maybe headed

3:31 - At least 3 orcas in Nisqually
, enjoying there afternoon seal snack. All the crabbers are gone so they are just hanging out not being bothered. -Miranda Ries

1 pm -
We saw
three groups heading west toward Shelton
, Hammersly Inlet, about 2 hours apart - never saw them coming back out heading east. -Jana Walters

11 am - The orcas headed east through Eld Inlet
on the south side of Squaxin and Harstine islands. Then they headed north into Dana Passage and kept going.
There were 6
. These image were taken with a long telephoto lens and are cropped. And, within whale watching/boating guidelines. -Kim Merriman

The whale is out in the middle between
Erlands Point and Tracyton
4:35 pm
. I'm out in a 22' Boston Whaler, drifting about 300yards away from him/her (I don't know how to sex
a grey whale
and it seems rude to poke down there). -Katnip Sun

3:14 - Gray whale
update: A caller to our newsroom just now reported that it's
in Dyes Inlet, visible from Silverdale Waterfront Park
. -Kitsap Sun
*

2:12pm -
So apparently there's
a grey whale
somewhere in the vicinity of
Sinclair inlet
. Last report I saw was that
it was headed away from Silverdale and somewhere toward either Port Orchard and Gorst, back out toward Seattle
. Could have turned around but the people I saw at Evergreen said they didn't see it turn around. -Matthew Scheer

Something breaching under the
Warren Ave bridge in Bremerton
. Trying to get at better look. At Evergreen Park. -Ann Haines
