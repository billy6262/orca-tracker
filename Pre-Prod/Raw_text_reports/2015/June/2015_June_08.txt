Orca Sightings for June 8, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We enjoyed a spectacular evening with
J-Pod, including J27 Blackberry and L95 Nigel, and part of L-Pod in Haro Strait
. The whales were in a roly-poly mood, and it was fun to watch! Here's a few of them in front of Mt. Baker. -Monika Wieland
*
We had another amazing trip today - whales reported out by
Cypress Island
, so close to home! What a great surprise to find J-Pod almost in our back yard. We had some wonderful views of them before heading south towards James Island where we found
2 Humpback whales
, wow! Our passengers then had a choice - and voted to head back north to see J-pod for another short look, our special treat for doing so was a TRIPLE spyhop from members of J-pod! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

9:47 am -
Maia of WSF called to report
10 orcas in the middle of Rosario Strait
, feeding, possibly northbound.
*
We saw orcas on two different dates. We saw
one group of 7 to 9 orcas on the seventh and then the next day on the eighth, both in Eld Inlet
. -Andrew Edwards
*
T101A from tonight's encounter with the T101'
s. They were traveling north through the
Strait of Georgia
as per their normal routine. -Heather MacIntyre
*
This is one impressive orca!
T102
is simply massive! Every time I see him I'm impressed by his size ... Here is the thirty-one year old bull orca with a spyhop just after making a kill in the
Strait of Georgia
. -Heather MacIntyre

7:15 pm -
We saw a smalll pod of about
five orcas
, with one male. Appeared to be hunting off Protection Island, neighbor thinks they are seal hunters, not local pod. -Paul King
*
Beautiful
Orca seen from our deck on Eld Inlet
late afternoon. This pod was
heading to the Port of Olympia
. We live on Salty Drive off Hunter Point road in the steamboat community. -Kristin Susalski

A group of
Transients was sighted in Newport OR
on Monday,
June 8. Unfortunately I didn't get to see them, but several folks around town have reported seeing them swimming up into Yaquina Bay. Here are two posts that I've seen on Facebook, including pictures. -Jim Rice
*
Orcas in Yaquina Bay OR
, what a #WorldOceansDay treat! They've headed back out to sea, be on the lookout for this crew as they head north and likely visit a few more deep ports and bays along the way! -Photo courtesy of Oregon Marine Reserves
