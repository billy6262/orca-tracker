Orca Sightings for June 29, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we headed west in Spieden Channel we got the word---there were whales up ahead! Behind those two came the towering fin of
Lobo (K26)
, which told me we had members of both the
J14s and the K14
s...As we followed the whales we realized they were heading somewhere they don't normally go---they were pointed right for the
topside of Spieden Island
where they got serious about foraging. CWR (Center for Whale Research) says they haven't been seen in that spot for over 15 years!...We left them still on the north side of Speiden and later I heard they continued north towards East Point through Boundary Pass. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

We saw behavior from member's of
J Pod's Group A and the K14's
that has never been witnessed by researches before! The Southern Resident's went through the
Cactus Islands
! It's been seven years since researchers have seen them on the east side of Spieden Island, but they've never actually seen them go through the Cactus Islands. It was very interesting indeed. After they passed through,
J2 seemed to circle the J14's, J19's, and K14's
back around to forage some. They formed a lineup and seemed to be foraging as the North Atlantic whales would! It was incredible. -Heather MacIntyre

Its been long time since I had a report but we just had
two minke whales at Hannah Heights
- they came south and turned north again. Rather close to the shore- nice to see them around! -Sandy Buckley, San Juan Island
