Orca Sightings for November 15, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J53 Kiki and J44 Moby passing Point Robinson

Entry 2:
16:55 -
Watching from Arroyos (The bluffs below Marine view drive in
West Seattle
. Across from Dilworth,
Vashon
)...Maury Island with directional changes and lots of surface activity and breaching. Have moved SB trend for a bit. -Kersti Muul
*
Here are the photos from
Dash Point Park
viewpoint as the SRKWs made their way north past Gold Beach on Vashon (11/15,

2:30-
4:10pm
). Unfortunately I was at the far reach of my 600mm & 840mm lenses, but it was AMAZING to see so many whales - probably 20 foraging in small groups of 3-4.
J27 Blackberry, J47 Notch
. We saw lots of headstands, tail lobs, spyhops, rolls and breaches. The coolest shots are the full-body breach that happened right next to the research boat at 4pm and the sea snake that some fella brought to the party ...With salmon in short supply and the SRKWs visits so much less predictable, this dry, sunny, salmon-filled moment in time feels like a blessing for all of us...Belen Bilgic Schneider

J51 Nova (born 2015) and K36 Yoda (born 2003), J40 Suttles, J46 Star
. Today was butter!!! We got lucky, made it to the Browns Point Lighthouse just in time to see the Residents come out of
Commencement Bay

14:07 -
A large group is now heading northbound in
East Passage (away from Ruston Way)
Look for orange research vessel. -Zach Haen
*
I arrived at the Tacoma waterfront (between
Pt Defiance ferry dock and Anthony's
) shortly after 12 Noon to meet Gayle S. Soon after Gayle and I (and our new friend Kelly W) began seeing blows to the north spread across the channel
between Maury Island and Dash Point
. The pods continued steady progression as if heading towards Dalco Pass when at ~
12:20 quite a few turned towards
Commencement Bay.
I imagine some communication took place because after they did suddenly most everyone made an abrupt left and headed towards Commencement, some moving quickly and soon after breaches and tail lobs as they headed in that direction. A few kept out mid channel and began making a lot of directional changes. Gayle and I moved to higher ground to confirm if they were continuing into the bay...we saw a group of at least 4-6 close inshore off
Point Ruston
now heading back westbound. Thinking we might see a close pass we hurried it back to our spot by the ferry dock, but that group flipped and was now heading east again. We waited them out several minutes only to see that whales streaming eastbound towards Commencement. The three of us decided to head over to Ruston Way and find a spot which proved to be the excellent decision. Over the next 90+ minutes we watched Js/L87 and Ks spread out all over with a large percentage streaming their way right on into
Commencement Bay
in 1s-4s!

13:20
the leaders were deep into the bay, others still streaming in, while others stayed behind keeping to the outer edges still foraging with some surface activity. All the while NOAA collected samples. The whales who traveled into the bay made a northerly u-turn on their way out more mid channel, with some eventually moving closer to the Brown's Point side. It took some time to confirm which way they were going to go, but became clear they were heading back north via the main channel between east side of Vashon and the mainland. We left Ruston Way about
14:10 as the pods continued their travels north spread out across the channel between Maury Island and Brown's & Dash Points. We were off to find the humpback...Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 7:
Humpback Vivaldi in Dalco Passage

Entry 8:
*

16:50 -
Thinking
Vivaldi
was feeding/staying in the area under
Dalco Viewpoint
, Gayle, Kelly, and I moved up there and just as we stepped out of the car we heard loud exhalation out of sight behind the trees as if heading toward Owen Beach. We waited several minutes in hope s/he would circle back, but s/he did not. With no daylight left we headed back down to Owen Beach for perhaps a moonlight encounter, but we never laid eyes or ears on Vivaldi after stepping out of the car at Dalco Viewpoint at ~
16:50. A beautiful day with orcas, a humpback and friends old & new. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

16:22-

16:30 -
After watching
humpback Vivaldi
form the viewpoint we moved around down to
Owen Beach
. Soon after arriving Vivaldi cleared the point keeping a northbound line. We watch her/him mill back and forth for several minutes. S/he then appeared to be feeding, churning up the water and dozens of gulls were swooping in. We decided to move up to Dalco Viewpoint....

16:05 -
We (Gayle, Kelly and I) reached the
Narrows Viewpoint
, 5 Mile Drive in time to watch
CRC-15936/MMX0128 Vivaldi
surface just north of Salmon Beach fairly close in on the Tacoma side of the channel. S/he was traveling in regular surface patterns of 3-4 surfaces before diving. Vivaldi surface just below those of us watching from the bluff above as s/he continued north, showing her fluke one last time before moving out of sight.

Entry 12:
16:54 - Porpoises!
We saw a dozen or so porpoises close to shore near
Bremerton
- at dusk. There were two groups of five or six, and one straggler, moving briskly southward, and keeping near the shore at Enetai - just south of Illahee State Park in Port Orchard Passage, between Kitsap and Bainbridge. There was enough daylight to see the porpoises clearly, but too dark to get a photograph. -Brian Johnson
