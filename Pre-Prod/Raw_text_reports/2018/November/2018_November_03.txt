Sat Nov 3 - Puget Sound - on the Saratoga was another windy day, though thankfully not quite as choppy. Very quickly after we left the dock, we encountered the
T46s and T46Cs heading quickly south in Puget sound from Possession Point. We noticed that T46C had a new calf in tow!
We left the orcas to tour Colvos Rocks and watch Harbor Seals and Bald Eagles, but found them again
just north of Elliot Bay
. The family was a bit more relaxed and not traveling as close together so we got even better looks at the calf. We left them again to watch a Steller Sea Lion and then tour Elliot Bay before heading back to Edmonds. -Justine Buckmaster

Entry 7:
November 3 we found the
T46 pod, T46C pod, and T122 near Edmonds
on the MV Saratoga. It was a true highlight to see the brand new calf traveling with the T46C pod. We saw the calf many times as it came up next to a number of different members of the pod. It came up most often next to T46C, but it also surfaced next to T122, and others. We will await confirmation from whale researchers for the official word on who the mom is. The three big teenage males in these two pods - T46C1, T46D, and T46E hung back from the bigger group of females and subadults that were surrounding the new calf. T46E and T46C1 were spending a bunch of time together as a duo, and T46D was trailing closer to the females and young. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express.
