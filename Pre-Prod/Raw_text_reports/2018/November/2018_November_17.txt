Entry 3:
*

16:30 - Orcas approaching Kingston
, between Apple Tree Point and Eglon. -Sara Frey
*

16:05 - whales
have made steady progress southbound from
Point No Point
still seemingly more on Kitsap side as seen from south of Scatchet Head. -Sandra Pollard
*

15:44 -
Viewing
from Scatchet head
. Orcas Grouped up tightly now. Look to be heading south now.

15:35 - orcas
are still
south of point no point
. Seem to be trending north still. -Danielle Pennington
*

15:15 -
still seeing orcas spread out across the Possession Triangle (Point No Point/Edmonds/S Whidbey - as we call it -alb) looking further away so must be moving south, and judging by the crowd on the spit at Point No Point, they are getting some good views from there! What a beautiful day to watch Southern Resident orcas in Puget Sound, and even more beautiful to see them milling and foraging, hopefully finding lots of salmon.

14:30 - Orcas
are spread out north and south of a large sailboat, again, very difficult to determine direction - perhaps they are milling and foraging, but at least some seem to be
trending north toward Possession Pt/Sound
. There are some behind/west of the tugboat headed south, spread out over toward Scatchet Head/Possession Pt. I think they are milling and foraging, just saw a few breaches - but they seem to be moving east (toward the mainland) rather than west (toward Admiralty) at the moment, but not sure if their trend is north (into
Possession Sound
) or south (back into Puget Sound) from this distance. It is very difficult to see them from anywhere when they get lost in the Possession Triangle!

14:10 -
looks like orcas are very spread out, heading N/NE toward
either the south end of Whidbey Island and/or into Possession Sound?
Again, due to distance very difficult to tell how far east they are - but at this point closer to the Whidbey side and headed toward S. Whidbey.

14:05 -
FINALLY seeing some blows (viewing from south of Bush Pt), hard to tell with the distance and fuzzy visibility, but it looks like they may be
off Double Bluff
, about 1/3 of the way toward Point No Point? Not yet able to determine direction, can only see blows in the distance. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Saw
3 large males at Point no Point about
1:45pm
. -Lori Lucia Montana
*

13:00 -
We are leaving the scene now but some of the
Js appeared to be turning south at Useless Bay
.

12:35 - J pod and L87 currently swimming toward Useless Bay
. Foraging with the occasional breach. -Bart Rulon MV Saratoga
*
12 Noon -
Watching from
Point No Point
seeing blows, breaches spread out
between Picnic Point and Scatchet Head
. Looks like they're headed toward Admiralty. So North west bound. -Susan Marie Andersson
*

12:11 -
Looks like the lead group is approaching point no point now. Many other whales a blows following behind.

11:55 -
I'm at Maxwelton Beach (south Whidbey) and I am finally seeing blows. I am seeing two group heading north bound. The heat distortion is too severe to see any fins.
Maybe off Eglon on the Peninsula
. -Danielle Pennington
*

11:50 - orcas
southbound now.

11:25 -
Their current location (off
Possession Point
). Traveling NW. -Samuel Rasmussen
*

11:07 -
Several
orcas northbound
, look to be heading into
Possession Sound
. -Mike Hoene
*

10:45 -
Just lost the trailing group off Possession. They were steady NB with breaches. They are mid to east channel. I'd say the leading male is likely approaching Point No Point if they stayed on course.

10:07 -
Seeing quite a few. They are on the east side of the shipping lane. Steady NB travel at the moment.

09:50 - Orcas off Apple Tree Point NB
. Large male in group. -Sara Frey
*

09:36 -
large ship USAC just passed them. They (
orcas) are on Kingston side
of channel as viewed from Edmonds fishing pier. Still northbound, well north of Kingston ferry, not to Eglon yet. -Michelle Goll
*

09:27 -
At least
six Orcas with two large males
(I think more) spread out heading south just one mile
north of Kingston ferry
. Appears to be foraging and slowly moving. -Darlene Moneypenny
*

08:45 - orca in the Edmonds -Kingston ferry lanes heading north
. -Michelle St
*

08:43 - Orcas northbound
at SF buoy in the middle of traffic lanes. Spread out. Mostly likely
Residents
based on number of whales. -Jason Mihok
*

08:40 - Orcas
(residents I believe, number unknown),
NB just south of Pt. Wells/Edmonds
, in the center of the waterway. -James Greenway
*

Entry 4:
13:57 - Humpback
breaching close to shore north of
Edmonds Ferry terminal
! (
2:27 reply: He headed out...Between Point No Point and Whidbey. Incredible breaching tho!) -Biz Shoe Peterson
*

11:10 - Humpback
too! near
Eglon
southbound as viewed from Sunset Ave in Edmonds. -Michelle Goll
*

Entry 5:
14:07 -
Whale out north of
Hidden Beach!
Acting/feeding like a
gray
. -Nancy Culp Zaretzke
*

10:59 - saw a gray in Holmes Harbor
this morning. Plumes from blow, and a view of its back as it surfaced. Appeared to be feeding. -Melinda Faggard Base
*

08:41 -
it doesn't stay up for long and doesn't come completely out of the water, so it's hard to tell. Still going deeper into the harbor.

08:17 - Large whale
, probably a humpback heading south into Holmes Harbor across from golf course, closer to the east side. -Cindi Bowen
*

07:50 -
my friend Kevin Lungren just called me with a report of a probable
gray whale
(not 100% sure which species yet - he was crabbing so he didn't have binoculars) in
Holmes Harbor
about half way in, swimming east towards Freeland. -Bart Rulon
