============================================================

Entry 1:
16:25 -
Found them, East of
Point No Point
, more towards Whidbey side off channel. Northbound...far enough can only see blows. -Sara Frey
*

16:00 -
speedy male is heading towards
Point No Point
. Three huge breaches along the way.
15 55 -
Been watching a large dorsal moving at speed across
Possession Sound
now heading north on Kitsap side still in a hurry. Spotted a couple of other blows a bit further back also heading north. Visibility decreasing due to light rain. -Sandra Pollard
*

15:40 -
this group may have gotten word to head west. Seeing male and others further out and others spread N to S in SB shipping lanes SE of
Point No Point to South of Scatchet Head
.

15:20 -
at least one matriline of 3-4 (inc. Male) is about 1.5 miles offshore foraging off
north Edmonds
off Stamm overlook park and just to the south. Nice breach few minutes ago. Long down times. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

15:05 -
Can definitely say now they (at least some) are heading up to
PNP/ Admiralty
. They are moving very slowly.

14:50 -
picked them up again. At this point appear to be heading up toward
Admiralty
. Still very slow NW bound. -Sara Frey
*

14:43 -
I believe they are back in front of my place now on 27th Ave NW in Shoreline south of
Pt Wells
, one is close to shore but staying under and going north, it appears there is another surfaced but pretty far out and drifting south at the moment. -Thanks again, Kurt Blomquist
*

14:30 -
last seen with line of sight -
Kingston/Everett
and off south end of Whidbey. Appeared to be on the Kitsap side of channel and significantly slowed. Have now disappeared x about 10 minutes. -Sara Frey
*

14:30 -
Spotted a couple on the
Edmonds side around 2.30
. They may have crossed Possession to join other whales seen on the Kitsap side seemingly heading north as seen from Possession Shores. -Sandra Pollard
*

14:00 -
at least part of the pod is Edmonds side of green buoy off
Scatchet Head, South Whidbey
. NE bound towards Cultus Bay (sightline). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

13:35 -
still NB, mid channel - line of sight from
Apple Tree Point
approaching south tip of Whidbey soon, again, this is just line of sight. Perhaps a bit more west than previously and look to likely be heading to admiralty inlet. I see a lot of blows but mostly just the big boy's dorsals. Its a bit choppy and they are out a ways. -Sara Frey
*

13:30 -
All out from
Edmonds
, now north of the ferry dock. Leaders are further offshore. Main resting group has now split up loosely all northbound with male very close to Edmonds just outside the dive park. Too soon to say if they'll continue towards Mukilteo or Admiralty or going to stay around and forage. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

13:25 -
No longer very visible from Marina beach. Heading NNW. PS: this group is awesome!!! Y'all helped my husband and I see orcas for the first time today. -Rachel Worden
*

13:24 -
So incredible. They're heading away from
Edmonds
now, hopefully everyone on the west side gets a chance to see these beauties today, too. -Photo by Sara Lewis, Nov 6, 2018
*

12:57 -
6-8 spouts 1 mile south of the breakwater at
Port of Edmonds
. Headed NNW. -Andy Gregory
*

12:58 -
Still in resting lines in two tight groups off
Edmonds Dog Park/ Marina Beach
... steady northbound. Stunning.

12:50 -
can see several including a large male from Kingston. Appear to approaching the
Edmonds/Kingston
ferry line. Northbound - pretty far east in the shipping channel. Likely closer to the Edmonds side. Looks like the research boat is still trailing. -Sara Frey
*

12:05 -
pod is still grouped now right out from
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
, in Shoreline. Steady northbound. Research skiff (looks like Mark Sears) with them.

11:20 -
beautiful long resting line....northbound.
Carkeek
would be good viewing.

11:12 -
most have grouped up ( 12-15) and flipped, now northbound off
Golden Gardens
east of mid channel. Smaller group (2-3) ahead bit NE, and at least one more whale short distance ahead of that group. Steady slow northbound with some active foraging, milling. One male east and south of others.

10:55 -
the two groups (slightly spread) are (sightline from Golden Gardens )south of
Fay Bainbridge Park
, includes 2 males. Another male and at least one female just at north end of Fay B Park (again sightline) all mid channel. And at least one more male trails who is more east in the channel. At least 12-15 orcas...steady southbound. Elevation will be your viewing friend. Sunset park in Ballard would afford views for at least a bit. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

10:49 - Orcas passing Faye Bainbridge
. Heading south bound. East side of channel. -Carol DeRusha
*

10:47 -
watching a group from
Fay Bainbridge
. The group is southbound east side of channel. We saw at least 6 individuals spread out. Some breaches and surface activity. -Melinda Barajas
*

10:15 -
Loosely spread
at least 10
: I see at least 8 in two groups including male in each group, and another male up ahead leading, and another male in rear and to east, mid channel between
Golden Gardens
, N Seattle and just north of Fay Bainbridge Park. Steady southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

09:30 -
I saw what may have been two small orcas near the
north end of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
. Saw fins but no tail, the fins looked a lot like an orca as opposed to a dolphin. -Kurt Blomquist
*
By

9:40 -
I could see whales spread across entire channel from R
ichmond Beach to Jefferson Head
and to the south, in groups of 1-4, all steady southbound. At least 4 adult males. Tail lobs.

09:19 -
at least dozen spread across channel with some well east of buoy off
Richmond Beach
. Seen at least 2-3 males. I would say these are Residents.

09:10 -
another group of orcas trailing; one male mid channel north of buoy, with 2-3 others west of buoy. All steady southbound. Too far for IDs yet

09:05 -
at least
3 orcas Southbound
at Yellow mid channel buoy between
Richmond Beach/Presidents Point, Kingston
. Some foraging along the way. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

08:12 AM -
Mike at WSFerries reports a large
pod of orcas heading south near Kingston
.

08:07 -
I can only see 2 smaller whales and then one Male about 100 yards behind them. Moving west like yesterday morning...Add 2 more small whales to that count. -Luaithrend Inghean Uilliam
*

07:40
I saw them too! Getting spoiled to keep seeing them on daily walks. Viewing from Edmonds fishing pier just north or
Kingston
ferry terminal trending south. Probably south of the terminal by now. -Michell Goll
*

07:35 -
I can't believe I'm messaging this for the third time in a week, but I'm seeing a male Orca fin off
Edmonds
mid channel, headed south. There might be more, but it's far enough out that I could be missing smaller fins. -Josh Adams

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -

17:23 - Orca headed down San Juan shore
south if rocky bay headed to point caution. -Alan Niles
*

Entry 3:
15:30-

16:00 - Henderson Bay
. I saw them heading toward Purdy Spit first. They stalled for a bit out in the middle of the bay. I thought there were two male separate from each other but never saw them at the same time. Then I saw them heading out of Henderson Bay but not directly toward Cutts Island then I lost them....My neighbors say they saw more than I did heading toward Purdy Spit. Maybe the group split up. Seen in Henderson Bay between

3:30-
4:00. -Terry Shovlowsky

13:13 -
from the Anderson Island Facebook group, our
Fox island
neighbor (Bob Wagner) said: The
orca's
turned around and swam right by our place about 30 yds off shore. They are in
between Fox and McNiel Island
. There are
5-6
and a young one too. -Belen bilgic Schneider

Noon - Orca sighting off Steilacoom, at least 4
heading north. Had a couple of breachings. Looks like some young ones one adult for sure, much bigger. Too far away for photos. -Jim and Nancy Taylor

11:54 - 3-4 large and a small orca in Steilacoom.
-Lisa Wiksten

Orcas in south Puget Sound!
I'm at Sunnyside Park in Steilacoom. Watching them
between Vashon and McNeill
. There appear to be 3-5, feeding. Many birds flitting about for scraps. Out walking with no camera, so no chance for pictures. But what a wonderful sight! -Tari Poe Norris

Entry 6:
8:30 AM
, (+/-) I spotted
a pod of orcas heading NW out of Dana Passage
, mid channel between Hartstene Island and Dickensen Point. There were 6 or 7 in the pod, including two large adult males. The pod appeared to be traveling in a relatively tight group with no animals straying far from the group. I was able to observe them for two breathing cycles of the pod, and then they disappeared. -Bob Burreson
