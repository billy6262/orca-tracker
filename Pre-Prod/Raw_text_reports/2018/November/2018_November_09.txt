Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -

most if not all the pod rounded Whidbey mostly grouped and look to be heading west directly
towards Kitsap
. Not up Admiralty. A lot of breaching going on, some pec slaps, lazy rolls, etc.

16:05 -
Many of us on the shores watched as they came from the north, first group mid channel. Others following with one group porposing at one point, then on a dive in front of us surfacing a little spread apart. Currently looks like all have passed
Possession Park
, spread across the channel and mile or so distance between leaders and trailers. Some foraging, breaches, forward lunges etc. while moving southbound toward Puget Sound proper. Large number hugging Whidbey others mid channel as we lose sight. -Alisa Lemire brooks, ON

All spread out between as far north as
Fox Spit/Camano Island State Park
and to the south. So much beautiful foraging with lots of tail slaps while foraging, stunning chum? Leaders made it north of Fox Spit then pod flipped southbound, some with eager determination, a couple porpoising while others kept steady pace. Watching them continue south, I wandered down to the shoreline and while watching others who passed a female surprised us passing quickly close to shore...she and at least one other stalled out south of Fox Spit making many directional changes and engaged in some high flying breaches. Pod is still spread across the channel and N to S to at least Bells Beach on Whidbey side. -Alisa Lemire brooks, ON

Also said they didn't see them until they almost docked in Mukilteo. "from Clinton to Mukilteo.

17:00 -
My hubby noticed three kayaks paused at
Eagle Cove
, SJI at sunset today and then shouted...."and the whales are here too"! I was thrilled by the behaviors I witnessed! My only regret is that I couldn't ID them as the light was so dim and they were extremely active. There were 8-12 individuals, at least 3 large males, females, a juvenile, and a tiny wee one. (I couldn't tell if it had an orange tinge as the lighting was tricky) They remained on the south side of Eagle Point and were foraging back and forth, over and over again, and exhibiting extreme above-water behavior. At least 20+ breaches/bellyflops, several spyhops, and excessive pec slaps and tail lobbing. It sounded like the 4th of July out there! They stayed very close together, almost clustered, tactile-like behavior. And then back to foraging behavior, back and forth! After pitch darkness, I could still hear their exhales and extensive above-water behavior. Last I could hear them, it sounded like they were headed slightly south/southwest, perhaps towards Salmon Bank. -Lodie Giblert Budwill
*
Had a great encounter this evening with a group of orcas between
False Bay and South Beach
. The foraging behavior was very Res. Seemed to be be having success. Lots of surface behaviors. More breach's than I could count. Tails slaps, cart wheeling and crazy amount of peck slaps from the large male in the group. We were paddling and they we enjoyed them for some length of time till sunset and dark. They seemed to be moving off shore to the west slowly. Not a single boat anywhere in sight this evening. -Jason Gunter

Entry 8:
09:39 -
call from
Hood Canal between Hoodsport and Holiday Beach
of 2 orcas headed south. They were bigger than dolphins but no further details.
*

Entry 9:
J pod/L87
were 8+ miles ahead, is possible a split off group of Rs or a small pod of Bigg's - alb
)

16:30 - 3 orca
milling
south of Hat Island
and may be headed South towards the ferry lanes. I was on the Everett side near the Port, they were probably 2km away. They seemed bigger and darker than harbor porpoise and could see a white saddle patch- not well enough for an indiv ID but didn't seem like a Dalls. It looked like they did a loop from Edgewater Park, NW through Possession Sound, up near Hat Island, and left again South. -Jessica Blanchette
*

14:40 -
Looking from
Polnell Shores to Camano
. Photos pulled from video. Poor quality. (looks to be between Race Lagoon and Rockaway Beach, Camano) No large males. Didn't come any further north. I saw at least 2 surface at the same time. We watched until we could no longer see them so I assume the headed south. There was breaching, tail slaps and one Spyhopping. Then it just stopped. -Terra Parham

Entry 12:
Gray whale CRC-2234 on the Hammersley Inlet
