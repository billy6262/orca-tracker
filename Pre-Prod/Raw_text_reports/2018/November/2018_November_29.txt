Orca Sightings for November 29, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -

14:00 - (orcas)
They really weren't moving with any intention. Last I saw them they could have gone toward
Tolmie, Nisqually or the other side of Anderson Island
. If you are watching for them be patient. They dip just below the surface, then up and breathe, back down in the same spot.

13:00 - (orcas) between Devil's Head and Zittles Marina
. Looks to be an adult with a calf. Can't confirm if there are 2 young ones. I see the adult rise followed by a small fin then 2 exhales but can only spot one calf's fin. Moving very slowly. -Joan Ahre

off the south end of Key Peninsula, north end Nisqually Reach. He reports at least 1 adult and 1 juvenile.

adult male and we believe either two juveniles or a female and juvenile came close to Devil's Head and slowed a bit. Then continued quickly through
Dayton Passage on Anderson side
