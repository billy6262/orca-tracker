Orca Sightings for November 21, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:50 -
Possible
humpback off President Pt, Bainbridge Is.
again today. Same place, south and west of the yellow mid channel marker. Trending south, huge splash. Could she have a baby with her? Thought I saw two dorsel(?) Fins last time she went down. More info later: It made a couple close passes this afternoon and it was alone. There was a porpoise or something small hanging out near it at one point. No good pictures. One really big splash and a lot of going back and forth. -Joanne Graves

Entry 2:

I just saw what appears to be either
a gray or humpback whale
just south of the
Mukilteo Ferry lane
... it is a bit difficult to determine what direction it is headed but for now seems to be feeding in the area! Sorry there aren't pictures he/she was a bit far off a ways. I did see very briefly a very low - not too pointed dorsal fin- it very much resembled that of the grays we saw in the spring. But it was too far away to see any distinct markings unfortunately. -Danica Gonsalves
