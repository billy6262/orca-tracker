Orca Sightings for November 12, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
K pod - Juan de Fuca Strait ...At
12:11
we received a call that she saw them south south east of Constance Bank. After close to 2 hours of searching in the choppy water, we finally got into calm enough water to the east where I could make use of the Swarovski binoculars and spotted a fin in the distance which turned out to be
K21
. We could see that it was likely all of K pod and they were fairly spread out on
Coyote Bank traveling on a line for Admiralty Inlet
...Full encounter report & images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 100.

4 orcas between Kangaroo Point and North Peapod Island

between North Peapod Island and Point Lawrence on the Eastern tip of Orcas Island
. Again they circled, and presumably fed and lolled about, then sounded again. Later on we noticed them out in the middle of Rosario Strait, leisurely heading south. -Ken and Marcia Culver, Olga WA

from the ferry while docked in Kingston. We have 2 humpbacks between there and South Whidbey. -Michelle Goll
*

13:00 -
watching a very active
humpback whale out from Possession Shores
heading northwesterly. Now out from Scatchet Head a mile or so. When I first saw the whale s/he was out from
Sandy Hook/Possession Shores and Scatchet Head
closer to Whidbey and breached non stop as heading or angling over
towards Eglon
where I had the
breaching humpback and orca blows all going on at the same time
. Indeed grateful. I think we have the trifecta like Alisa calls it. Heard there was a gray whale near Everett too. so Gray, Humpback and the SRKW's orcas in the north sound. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 7:
15:30 -
after feeding in Sand bar for 20 minutes or so, moved away from shoreline, slowly moving west towards
Mukilteo
....watched it until about

3:45
, milling a bit offshore. Can't confirm if it continued toward Mukilteo or headed north. -Mary Dulin
*
(
reported as humpback but by description and behavior most
probably the gray whale
feeding. I've seen him feeding in that exact spot -alb
)

15:02 -
Multiple humpbacks off Harborview Park
Everett
. In shallow just milling around rolling.
West End of Harborview Park
off of some pilings on the point. I've seen blows very close together which made me think two or more. Sitting here on the beach watching them or him now..It's likely the same well it's in the exact same spot as Thursday in probably 40 feet of water...I just looked at pictures of both a gray whale and a humpback whale's dorsal I could be wrong. They look pretty similar. -Ryley Fee
*

14:55 pm
watching single blows off
Harborview park, Everett
. Appears to be feeding in Sand bar close to shore. Most likely a gray whale? -Mary Dulin
