Thu Nov 8 - On days like these I so wish I owned a SUPER magnified camera lens ... A little late to post,
@
4:20 at Harper Pier/ Southworth watching our Southern Residents
, identified as
J pod
. I was watching two separate groups, as they split at
south end of Blake Island after exiting Colvos Passage
. Saw 3, then counted 4 to 5 observed trending on the west side of Blake Island...lots of activity and splashing as they are completely breaching out of the water, jumping into the sky, seeing tail slapping, spy hopping, they all appear to be super happy. The other group, I counted ~ 6-7 with two large ones as they trailed off to the east side of Blake Island, after stalling at the south tip. Lost all in the
sunset at Pomeroy Park in Manchester @
5:15
. So happy to see the Southern Residents enjoying their day, they appear HAPPY! Makes my heart Happy! -Kathe Bradley
