Entry 1:
RESIDENT KILLER WHALES-
J pod/L87 - Admiralty Inlet
- Melisa, Tom, and Jane met at Snug Harbor and left the dock around 1030 aboard "Morning Star". After a bit of searching, "Morning Star" spotted blows at
1250, south of Point No Point but north of Apple Cove Point in Admiralty Inlet.
J pod was spread out in loose groups and slowly heading south...Full encounter report & images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 98.

Definitely
residents tonight at Point No Point
. It got dark so some photos are grainy. They were quite spread out with it taking about an hour for all to pass. Some were mid channel and the evening wrapped up with three being very close in. I believe J42 is the first shot and then finger saddle - J17? Note the big male breaching in the back by the yellow marker in the third shot in comments. -Sara Frey
