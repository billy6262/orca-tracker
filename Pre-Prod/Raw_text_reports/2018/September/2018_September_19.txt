Orca Sightings for September 19, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait, SJI;
11:35am ~
12:13pm,
I observed 8 orcas including 2-3 males traveling to the NW across the western edge of
Hannah Hts
toward and beyond Edwards Point. The moved quickly as individuals (no groups) with 2 of them doubling back just before Edwards Point to forage. The large male stayed, foraging with an accompanying excited seagull for about 10 minutes before resuming his travel to the NW. It was
J27
, the beautiful "Blackberry". Haro Strait, SJI -between the western-most edge of Hannah Hts and Edwards Point.

3:40 pm ~
3:52pm
From the shore I had the pleasure to watch
J39 "Mako"
twirl, dive, pop-up, roll over & emerge sideways with pectoral fin up over and over again. He didn't move much from the one spot. Mako had the Salish Sea to himself and I was a lucky witness. For 12 minutes all was right with the world. -Michelline Halliday
