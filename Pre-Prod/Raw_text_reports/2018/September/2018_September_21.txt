I took off to Fox Spit as the
orcas were just passing Fox Spit heading towards Greenbank/Baby Island
. T137s off Baby Island changed directions but were actually milling out around mid to 1/4 mid channel as I then was watching from Baby Island Heights bluff...around

2:30
they decided to enter into Holmes Harbor and on down south towards Freeland. they cut short of Freeland around 4 and started heading back. We saw them again around
6 pm heading back out of Holmes Harbor
and heading north closer to Whidbey side out from Hidden Beach. -Marilyn Armbruster

Big pod in Holmes Harbor south of Honeymoon Bay at
4:15
heading YOUR way into Freeland -Robert Hrycenko
*
They're back... The
T137s
powered deep into
Holmes Harbor
this afternoon, suddenly altering course from mid-channel to cruise past the former Beachfire dock (a favorite spot for seals) before abruptly turning and traveling across to the other side of the harbor. Seems the happy memories of seal buffet from three days ago were just that - memories - as they rapidly changed direction again and
headed north towards Baby Island and Saratoga Passage
