Beautiful, overcast with silvery reflective water...found
T87 and the T90s
, including a 2 yr old (or so) calf who isn't in the 2016 catalog. T87 is est. 56 years old (!) and is known to swim with this matriline....which makes me wonder if he is the father of any of her calves???? She is 38, so at the upper range of calving. Her young son is 12 and sprouting, and her daughter is 8. Found them just outside Friday Harbor, and followed them northwest up the island, and into
Speiden Channel
. Beautiful day! -Bonnie Gretz
