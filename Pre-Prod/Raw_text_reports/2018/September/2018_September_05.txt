============================================================

Entry 1:
L Pod!!
Headed up North, stopped at
Whale Rocks near Cattle Pass
to check out the Steller Sea Lions and Cormorants, then we kept going and found a few members of
L Pod
!! All photos are zoomed and cropped, and all whale wise guidelines were followed! - Janine Harles

J and L pods -
What an exciting day yesterday! We headed out on one of our fall Marine Life Studies killer whale surveys. The ocean was alive in
northern Georgia Strait
, with sightings of transients, northern residents, and an encounter with southern residents! The encounter took place off Grants Reef
near Campbell River
, BC. We counted
close to 20 killer whales belonging to both Jpod (J27) and Lpod
. Both groups were spread out over 3 km and were foraging with long dives averaging 5 minutes. We
also sighted humpbacks
within the general area of the residents. After a few hours of observation both pods joined and began to
travel slowly east
, which allowed us to collect photographs for identification. We are still looking through photographs for J050. - Josh McInnes and Nick Templeman, Marine Life Studies, Cetacean Research

Wow...What a special day with
K POD
of our Beloved endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales! Our naturalist Deanna Brett spotted what
looked like a Humpback Tail
lobbing off Jordan River so we turned south to take a look...what a pleasant surprise to find
breaching orca
instead! We found
K Pod
heading westbound and we were the only boat around again...although a couple did go the extra mile to have a quick visit. - Paul Pudwell

Entry 2:
10:37 - Orca pod heading north off Clinton
. Middle of the Sound off of the ferry route. Too far away for my bins to see detail. -Ann Breeswine

Entry 3:
two Orcas in the Saratoga passage between Camano Island and Whidbey Island
at about

2:00 pm
. Apparently feeding. I was in a sailboat, with light wind and turned off my engine. First they were going north away from us, but then they turned and came toward me. One breached about 20 feet next to the boat. Got some great pics. Hope you can identify them. -Don Van Valkenburg

A delayed report from British Columbia: I'd like to pass along a whale sighting. My brother took this shot on the ferry Sept 5, 2018
heading to Prince Rupert from Port Hardy.
It was just
north of Namu, B.C.
