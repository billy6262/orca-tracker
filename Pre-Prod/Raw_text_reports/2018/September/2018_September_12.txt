Entry 1:

-Cathy King

I was at
Patos Island
on

Entry 2:
orcas
were observed starting at

9:15 am until
9:18 am at the Patos Island lighthouse.
They swam northward around Alden Point and continued eastward along the north side of Patos Island until they were no longer visible from my location. There were four harbor seals in the water meters away from land at Alden Point, but the orcas showed no interest in the seals. There were three orcas but I only took clear pictures of the saddle patch of one of orcas, which I have attached. -Antonio Flores

a very spread-out
pod of orcas traveling east-to-west off Flint Beach, south of Lopez Island

Entry 3:
a pod
going in a big circle in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
, heading north to Victoria. -Nikky Benn

Watching whales in the fog is such a surreal experience. We were so fortunate that
T18 and the T19s
were circling a large meal for hours, otherwise we may have lost them as they traveled. There were a few times when they surfaced close enough we could hear them breathe, but couldn't see them! GRAPHIC IMAGE WARNING! The last photo in this sequence shows some leftovers from the kill we found floating at the surface. It appears to be the skin and blubber of a Minke Whale! -Justine Buckmaster

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES -

Entry 4:
11:00 -
We may have spotted the p
od Salish Sea Orcas 500 yards east of chrome island
,(N of Nanaimo, BC) there was also a single orca about 1/2 mile sw of the main pod. The pod appeared to be traveling north. The single killer whale appeared 500 yards or more east traveling in the same direct. The pod appeared to be feeding the single killer whale just swam in a straight line. -Cheryl Smith

, Whale rocks, Cattle Pass, San Juan Island. -Jim Maya
Orca Network comment from Susan Berta: This one was branded at Rogue Reef, OR - I would guess in about 2009 - there is a chart on this page that gives the numbers, locations, and year branded, but it only goes up to 663R which was 2007: Steller Sea Lion Sightings
