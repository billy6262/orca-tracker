Orca Sightings for September 3, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -

13:15 -

14:24 - Haro Strait SJI, off Hannah Heights area
. Observed from shore with binocs & through a 300mm lens. I'm sorry I don't have ID's.
2nd sighting;

1:55pm ~
2:24pm
, I missed the approach but counted 1
2 or more orcas including 3 large males
with one male very close to shore
traveling to the NW towards Westside Preserve
. There was some milling about and direction reversals but everyone caught up and off they went out of sight.
1st sighting;

1:15pm ~
1:38pm
, I missed the beginning but observed
7 orcas with 1 large male traveling to the SE
, spread out, 3 tail slaps & 1 breaching.
Being Labor Day weekend, there were lots of boats with some disrespecting the Whale Wise Guide. Boats that were respectful were even honking at the offending boats. This is hard to watch knowing what we know about the fragility of the SRKW. -Many thanks, Michelline Halliday

J26, then J36 and J42

5 Orca
moving quickly toward the southeast. 2 large males. They were already there when I saw them so I might have just caught the tail end of their passage. Very spread out, not close in. Observed one huge tail slap. Beautiful orcas, beautiful sunrise. -Michelline Halliday

confirmed by sight 90 minutes later by Michelline, cannot confrim those heard in pre-dawn hours by Cher were residents, but seems probable - alb

If I had to guess direction of travel, I'm thinking South. Still going, percussives and blows, though blows seem further away now.

, and a lot closer to shore! No mistaking these sounds! Though ecotype is up in the air?

now! Distant blows...Cher Renke

Today Monday
September 3rd around

1:30 pm
with high tide, my family was playing at howarth park Beach in
Everett
wa. We looked left and there was a pod of orcas swimming about 50-100 feet from shore. They were
headed towards Mulkiteo
ferry around the bend. Was purely magical. I didn't realize they swim so far inland. Thought I would share. -Heidi Oshie

I was out crab fishing by
Mukilteo
Washington ferry dock just a little south from the dock on Monday and these two whales Surfaced right next to my boat. -Mark Mateu

Lovely day on 9/3 with
