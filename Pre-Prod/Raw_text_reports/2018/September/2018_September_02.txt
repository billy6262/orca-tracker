Entry 2:
Ls -
15:22 Southern resident L12s n bound from Race Rocks
. On scene right now. Traveling
north towards Victoria
...Great to be back in the Pacific Northwest, and in our research stomping groups off Race Rocks Pacific Ecological Reserve. We went out looking for a report of transient killer whales off East Sooke park and instead found members of the endangered southern resident Lpod. We identified
L41, L77, L85, L94, L113, L121

We had the pleasure to visit
40 to 50 humpback whales west of Sooke
and also first to find some of

off Sooke
minutes from our docks on the way home! To top it all off we were the only boat with this amazing encounter in our whole 3 hour adventure...JUST US! L22, L89 L94 -Paul Pudwell

13:02 -

14:11 - Haro Strait, SJI; between Edwards Point and Pile Point
. Many individuals
traveling to the SE
. At least three groups. I'm estimating 19 individuals, but I pretty much lost count, they were very spread out. I saw
at least 3 large males
. I saw 7 breaches! Much tail slapping. Watched from shore with binocs. Video footage using a 18-300mm lens. I'm sorry I can't confirm identities but there were plenty of boats so I think someone can identify. With much happiness, -Michelline Halliday
*
With all the angst felt over the Southern Residents it's important to sometimes just enjoy the beauty that still exists. I think this is
J39 Mako
. I never got a good enough look at the saddle to confirm, so I could be mistaken. Sunday outside the boat exclusion area
off Lime Kiln
. -James Gresham

I am thinking it's the same
humpback
I heard earlier now heading back north should be about
President Point Kingston
right about now. Just moseying along very close in....No fluking at all the whole time I watched.....just Sunday morning cruising.

05:00 - Point Jefferson, Kingston
. Something BIG......either a
humpback or gray
(if they are even still in the area) just went by heading south very close in. The incoming cruise ships woke me up and with the still morning I wanted to get come pictures of their lights reflecting on the water. It was awesome to hear the whale and it's blows in the dark. Had the humpback pattern....3-4 and then quiet as in a dive. Looked through the binoculars and saw it's back a couple times but never any flukes. (It was a humpback. Looking at the photos I took.....in the reflection of a cruise ships lights I can see it's back on one of it's surfaces.) -Chris Beamer Otterson
