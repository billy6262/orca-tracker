UNIDENTIFIED WHALES -

Entry 4:
minkes or humpbacks? - 3-4 whales feeding off north end of San Juan Island around O'Neal Island
trending east
10.45-11.11 am
. Pretty sure they were minkes based on length guessing 25-30 feet long, with wide unmarked flukes. Though smaller swept back dorsals could be pilot whales, but seemed bigger than that. Never saw rostrum, fins or chevron/blaze/saddle markings. Spouts 6-10 feet high. When we first saw them they seemed to be going back and forth and then settled on east and were pacing the boat for a time. Spouts were very misty. -CJ Mcanulty
