If anyone has photos or IDs' from this pod please forward. One possibility: we had T36 & T36B's (4 total) in South Rosario on Friday around

17:30 - T137A
wowed everyone coming close to shore at Fox Spit. The whole group has now passed and are southbound as of 540. Very long down times. After being entertained by the raccoons, the whales came into view southbound. I looked at my photos, and said, that's not the T65As, that looks like the
T46s and T137s
, which in fact, it was! We were watching totally different whales from this morning we didn't even know were around. We headed to
Shangri La Shores
where the whales absolutely delighted us and several others with a close pass by at the dock. They continued south, swimming through lots of floats as they went, making their way briefly into
Holmes Harbor
. Eventually they rounded
Fox Spit
, with one of my favorite whales
T137A
passing VERY close to shore. They continued south, and I went home. Nearly 9 hours of whale chasing complete! All pictures taken from shore, at Shangri La or Fox Spit. -Rachel Haight

is back!
Gray whale CRC-2234 goes on a dive.
It was heading north mid-channel between my shore and

Cooper Point spit into Eld Inlet
. In just a few minutes, it turned around heading north out of Eld, and surfaced right in front of the house. Then it decided to head east, toward Boston Harbor Marina and continued its journey south into Budd inlet - where I lost sight of it. Very robust blows and a 3 up surfacing series followed by a longish dive. Lots of showing off its tail fluke. Grateful! So so grateful! -Kim Merriman
