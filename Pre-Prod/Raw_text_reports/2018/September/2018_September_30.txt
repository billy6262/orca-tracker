Entry 3:

. It started to get really rough and we were heading home slowly from
Possesion
when I saw blows up ahead! Then we lost the whale, lol! Tim says, did you lose another whale? And on cue this guy/gal flys out of the water! 10 times!!! It was hard to get shots as it was rough, but happy with these! Then the hb waved, another spiral breach, and then it waved it's tail front and back tail slaps roughly 30 times!!! Whale has been ID'd as
BCY0349 Masquerade
