Orca Sightings for August 6, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
NOAA Update:
J50 Update
: Response teams continued their search for the J pod of Southern Resident killer whales on Monday (8/6) without success. The whales have
not been seen since Saturday night
, when they were spotted in open waters on the west side of Vancouver Island. Veterinarians remain on standby to conduct a health assessment of J50, which will inform further steps to support the whale. We deeply appreciate the assistance of many invaluable partners assisting in the search, as well as great public support for the dedicated response teams in the field. We will provide further updates as they become available. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast
