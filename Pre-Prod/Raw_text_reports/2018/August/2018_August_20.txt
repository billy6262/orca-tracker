Orca Sightings for August 20, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J50/Scarlet Update
(8/20): Response teams spent about three hours on Saturday (8/18) monitoring J50/Scarlet as J Pod returned to the Salish Sea on the way towards San Juan Island. Biologists aboard a SeaDoc Society vessel reported
J50/Scarlet actively socializing
with the rest of the pod, a hint that her condition may be improving slightly. She fell behind the pod as the whales swam east, but University of Washington saw her rejoin her mother (J16/Slick) and sister (J42/Echo) to forage near
Hannah Heights on the west side of San Juan Island.
University of Washington also collected two fecal samples from the group. -Photo by Katy Foster/NOAA Fisheries West Coast

The
65As and the T99s in Saanich Inlet
, BC, last night. An amazing evening! You could see the orange sun barely through the smoke, but it did bring a somber beauty to the moment. Too many images for one post. Part one, The Mugging of a Marina. -Jim Maya
*
Today's trip took us up to
Sydney
, BC, where we found
two groups of transient orcas
- no passport required! We found, and traveled with, the
T99s and T65As (including their new calf) from Sydney to Pole Island to Swartz bay
! As they swam, they made stops to slap their tails and to hunt in kelp. Along the way, we saw harbor seals and porpoise swimming about, a bald eagle landing on a tree, and a river otter! We enjoyed the cool air and sun as we voyaged back towards port after another amazing day! -Amy W., Mystic Sea
