Entry 11:
18:25 - We are off Johnson Point near Olympia
. Saw what seemed to be smaller orca breach and blowing. Also porpoises feeding. Seems porpoises are going back and forth. Orca seemed to be alone and is gone....What we reported last night was not these guys. What we saw was much larger, with really white sides. We did not see the head. But we got a glimpse of a white underbelly. Really stocky body. After spending several hours on line looking at pictures and info we think maybe what we saw was one or two Dall's Porpoises. -Judith Judd
(
leaving as unidentified with reporting party leaning Dall's. Common dolphins was proposed by ON as possiblity - alb
