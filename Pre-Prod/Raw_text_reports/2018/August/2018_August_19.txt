Orca Sightings for August 19, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sightings Sunday (8/19) reported
J Pod
headed west again, back
toward open ocean. The plan going forward is to administer another dose of antibiotic through a dart and, if possible, a second dart with dewormer to reduce parasitic worms that can harm emaciated marine mammals like J50/Scarlet and that were found in the recent fecal samples from three whales including J50. The veterinary team believes another dose of antibiotic remains the priority to treat potential infection since the first dart on 8/9 delivered only a half dose. This demonstrates that darting a swimming killer whale with thick skin, particularly on the fins and flukes, from a rocking boat is challenging. To ensure that J50/Scarlet receives the medication, veterinarians may switch to a collared needle with a ridge that holds it in place long enough to deliver the full dose. This type of dart is commonly used to treat wildlife, such as elephants, and will fall out in time.

Several groups passed by
Sheringham Lighthouse (Sooke, BC)

A fisherman called in a report of
orcas near Lummi Island
, so Captain Eric altered course to see those whales! Once we reached
Village Point we found the T65As
! We spent the early afternoon with them as they swam and hunted, with their new calf (born this spring) - who seems to be doing well! We stayed with this group as they traveled towards Cypress Head, making quick detours at various islands to see seals, eagles and other wildlife! -Amy W., Mystic Sea

Pod went in as far as mussel rafts and turned around. Mid channel in westbound and now mid channel eastbound, past
Coupeville Wharf
. So cool to ring the wharf bell on their way in. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
Video below begins with the
T100s exiting Penn Cove
as filmed from beautiful Long Point. Once outside the cove, this family of four circled and milled for a while mid channel before eventually moving on to the northeast. Prior to this video, we had the opportunity to
ring the whale bell on the Coupeville Wharf
and make some heartfelt connections with dozens of residents and visitors from around the world who lined the wharf in hopes of a glimpse. After some very long down times the orcas finally did surface to the west. We had some wonderful discussions and impromptu Q & A. The whales went as far as the mussel rafts then flipped and headed right back out the cove.
