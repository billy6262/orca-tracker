Orca Sightings for August 17, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J50/Scarlet Update
(8/17): Test results from the health samples collected from
J50/Scarlet
are starting to come in from several top laboratories around the country. The first finding comes from a fecal sample collected last weekend from a group of three
J Pod whales: J16/Slick, J42/Echo, and J50/Scarlet
. It showed moderate levels of Contracaecum, a nematode parasite that has previously been found in killer whales and other marine mammals. The worm is not usually a problem in healthy animals. However, in animals that are emaciated or are otherwise compromised, the parasite can penetrate the stomach lining, introducing bacterial infection to the bloodstream, or it can bore into internal organs. While we cannot be sure the sample came from J50/Scarlet, the veterinary team has updated her treatment priorities to include a dewormer, in addition to an antibiotic. Both have proven successful and safe in other cetaceans. The treatment should help J50/Scarlet by reducing bacterial and parasitic burdens on her system so she can start regaining the weight she has lost.
The whales remain in open waters off the west side of Vancouver Island
, beyond the reach of the response teams. Fisheries and Oceans Canada and other partners continue their watch for signs of J Pod's return to the more protected waters of the Salish Sea. Updates HERE. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast

Entry 2:
pods loosely grouped between Hidden Beach, Whidbey and Cama Beach State Park
, Camano Island.

20:00 -
We moved to
Hidden Beach
, Whidbey and could see the pods still well north of us making slow progress while milling and drifting slowly towards Camano side. They seemed fairly committed, but at some point they flipped, made the directional change and started heading north where they continued for a significant distance. Then when almost out of our sight they flipped once again, now back to traveling southbound. The families picked up speed and passed
between Hidden Beach and Cama State Park
in the waning light which cast beautiful warm hues from orange to purple on the sandy bluffs across the passage on Camano making for a gorgeous backdrop. We left them on course for Camano State Park just to the south.

18:00 - Pod is out from Shangri La Shores
mid channel slowly southbound while engaging in some directional changes, circling, and surface activities: tail lobs, breaches, pec slaps in glassy calm seas.

17:26 -
Seeing pod mid channel slow southbound steady travel off

My family and I were headed South from Canada to the US on

Entry 3:
north of Stuart Island and East of Moresby Island
, just north of the border. Only one other sailboat was traveling south of us, no whale watching boats. We saw a couple whales in the distance coming our direction headed northbound. We immediately stopped so they could pass. We spotted them a ways off on our port side. A few minutes later,
4 orcas
surprisingly surfaced within a few feet from our boat. They apparently turned around to come and see us. After swimming around under our boat, the 4 orcas went west to join one orca that seemed to be hanging out on the surface and not moving much. I was able to take a few pictures and compared them to a 2012 report I found online. I identified one of them as
T002C, Tasu
. I'm assuming she was with
3 of her kiddos
when they surfaced near us. I'm assuming the orca just west of us that they joined up with was Tasu's other son,
T002C2 Tumbo
. He's the one with a curved back, which may explain why he wasn't moving much and just hanging out on the surface. Anyways, sorry for reporting this so late. I hope it helps. It was such an incredible experience that we will never forget! -CarlaRae Arneson

11:38 -
Hello again, It's been a busy day for Orca pods around
Hat Island
. I reported sighting early this morning and there have been several more in the last hour. Whale watching boats all around and larger sized
Orca whales
with some spectacular leaps. Smaller pod a short distance behind them. I'm sure you've received documentation from these recent sightings but it's been a unique experience to see them so close to the Hat Island side of the passage between Hat and Whidbey islands. -Thanks, Cheryl Stief

11:35 -
Watching whales heading north past
Camano Island

Entry 4:
*

11:03 -
approaching west side of
Camano Head
. Mid channel.

10:53 - Potential "relations" between T37 and T100C
. They're separated from everyone else and very close to one another, rolling, pec slapping, etc
1027: Saratoga is with T100's, T37, 37Bs and 34's just west of Gedney
. Group really spread out. No real direction. -Renee Beitzel, MV Saratoga

08:45 -
They were sighted again southbound close to shore on southeast corner of
Hat Island about
8:45, total 5
in the group. -Lori Christopher
*

07:29 - this pod of at least 3 Orcas
were in front of my home off the NW point of
Hat Island.
As they reached the point, they disappeared...not sure if they stopped to eat or just traveled north toward Camano or if they went east around the island? I've had my home for 23 years and have never seen them this close to shore! -Cheryl Stief

Entry 5:
T34s, T37, T37Bs, T100s - Saratoga Passage
. The
T100s
, who have been traveling inland Puget Sound for a few days, were joined by the others this morning. Filmed from shore off S
hangri La Shores and Hidden Beach
, Whidbey Island as they made their way south after having spent the day heading north up Saratoga Passage. When I caught up to them seas were glassy calm and the whales were in slow travel mode with some surface activity (tail lobs, breaches, circling, socializing). These families include one three-year old (
T100F, born 2015
) and two one-year-olds (
T34B and T37B2 - both born summer 2017
). -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
