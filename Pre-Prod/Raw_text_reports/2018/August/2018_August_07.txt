J50 Update
: Good news! Fisheries and Oceans Canada spotted
J50 with her pod off Port Renfrew
, near the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The promising news ends this day of important preparations and anticipation as teams searched for the whales. Today, response teams and partners staged supplies and readied themselves for an opportunity to assess J50. We will provide further updates as they become available. In the meantime, all updates, photographs, and video are available at the NOAA Fisheries West Coast website. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast
