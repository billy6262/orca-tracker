Orca Sightings for August 18, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
1 mile off False Bay 1900 hrs, J39 who looked to be fishing next to us with some echolocation on the hydrophone suddenly took off in close pursuit of a porpoise. J22 closer to shore was also in pursuit of another porpoise.
While
J22
was engaged with a porpoise
J37 and J49
were milling nearby by and soon
J40
came in to join
J22. J49
began following and became somewhat involved. Off shore there were what seemed to be 3 other chases happening around us, including
J22's son, J38
, being one of them. Wait 'til the Transients find out about this. -Cheers, Captains Barbara & David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

We spotted a pod of
orcas
from the coast trail at
East Sooke Park
yesterday morning (Saturday, Aug. 18). From what I can tell, they were southern resident orcas (maybe J-pod?). We were surprised and dismayed by the plethora of whale watching boats and small motor crafts that were swarming around them, many of which seemed closer than the allowed 200 meters, and a motor boat rushed at full speed right up to where they were. -Louise Alvarez

What a special day! We headed out in thick fog and within minutes we heard fisherman talking about Orca...With some help from our locals we were the first to find
J Pod off Otter Point
...minutes from our Dock. Than within a few minutes the fog lifted and we were able to share the amazing
Sooke
waterfront with these endangered whales foraging with some very active celebration.
J27 Blackberry (born 1991) and J51 Nova (born 2015)
..What we have not seen in a while...So GREAT TO SEA!

. They have been here for about 40 minutes. Circling in the same general area. Even a bit of lobtailing. -Randy Zimmerman

19:07 - orcas
slowly passing
Shangri La Shores, northbound

17:27 -
We watched
both groups head into Holmes Harbor
and stall out just in the entrance, south of Baby Island. Soon after they began circling, clearly on the hunt. While watching some females and young a bit south, heard a huge percussive sound to the north, turned to see the big guy T100C breaching about 4 times...belly flop breaches! Younger one started breaching as well, then both engaged in some tail slapping. They stayed split in two groups with T100C group exiting about
17:00 while the others remained for a while and headed out, clearing Baby Island about
17:30...all on northbound course. Viewed from
Baby Island Heights

Entry 4:

We had the perfect ending to a fantastic day of watching three pods of transient killer whales in Saratoga Passage on
August 18. The three families included the
T100 pod, T34 pod, T37 & T37B pod
. These 11 orcas were swimming north and south through
Saratoga Passage
. On the afternoon of the 18th the pods were grouped up very closely in a resting mode until they turned and aimed right
towards Baby Island
, at the mouth of Holmes Harbor, on Whidbey Island. Baby Island is a local haul out for harbor seals. After a long dive they surfaced and it was immediately obvious that they had caught something - most likely a seal or two. All the killer whales circled around and started getting active and playful.
T100C, a 16 year old male
, surprised us all when he exploded out of the water with a huge breach, and then he followed that up with two more in a row. Each time he landed with his pectoral fins straight out from his body making it look like he was trying to fly! What a finale to a fantastic day on the water with transient orcas on our newest boat, the Saratoga! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

16:20 - pods
turned and are now heading directionally towards
Baby Island/Holmes Harbor
at steady pace.

Entry 6:
T34s, T37 & T37Bs, & T100s
) traveling together off Whidbey Island in
Saratoga Passage
, North Puget Sound. This day, Saturday,
August 18th, the group cruised up and down Saratoga Passage as they did the day prior. This video begins once they turned their sights on
Holmes Harbor
and made a kill. While watching some of the females and young circling prey a bit south, we heard a loud percussive sound to our right and turned to see big male
T100C
breaching forward and landing belly-flops! One of the young ones started breaching as well, many tail lobs followed by all for the next several minutes. The first group exited Holmes Harbor, the others followed ~20 minutes later, all proceeded
northbound
