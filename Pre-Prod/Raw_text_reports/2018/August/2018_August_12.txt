Orca Sightings for August 12, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of
J-Pod with the Lummi Nation boat that brought Chinook salmon
, shown here off Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island. While not shown in this photo, earlier this afternoon we saw them make an
attempt to feed J50 Scarlet and her family
. While watching from shore, we had no way of knowing if they were successful or not. Yay for happy whale photos! 5 breaches in a row from my girl
J41 Eclipse

Entry 2:
*
Trip Report: We headed out toward San Juan Island with reports of
J pod spread along the shore and out into Haro Strait
. After a stop at Colville Island to see the adorable harbor seals, we caught up with some males about a mile out from Eagle Point, and had a very nice visit with
L87 Onyx (born 1992) who swims with J pod
, and young male
J38 Cookie (born 2003)
whose dorsal fin has really grown! We then had
J27 Blackberry (born 1991)
cruising north and were able to see his lovely saddle patch. We also saw
J31 Tsuchi (born 1995) who is J27's sister
. There were other members of
J pod
further south but since the researchers and others working to help J50 were there, we left that group. There were a nice group of big Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks....always a treat to see those magnificent creatures! The water was calm, it was cool, all together a lovely day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

This orca
passed very close to our boat today at
Cattle Point

Entry 4:
~

16:00 - Seal Rocks, north tip of Lummi Island
. Orca sighting!!

Entry 5:
19:27 - 7 - 8 orcas
, mid-way between
Bush Pt. and Lagoon Pt.
headed north, about one and a half miles offshore. -Claudia Mitchell
*
We saw the
Ts heading up Admiralty
from our neighbor's yard and from
Bush Pt. lighthouse
and from the
south side of Lagoon Point
. Best was at the BP light but they still avoided coming up near us. It was a thrill to see them finally. They were in a tight resting line about 3 miles south of us, through the big eyes.
T137A & looks like T46. T46E

. As Sandra posted, not close to Whidbey. Seem to be more spread out than earlier. Still going north. -Becky Livingston

While the plight of the Southern Residents and the recent events continue to haunt us, it was a pleasure to see so many people enjoying the magnificent spectacle of some of our well-known transient orcas, the
T46s and T137s
, cruising north along the west side of Whidbey Island on
August 12. Orcadorks and spectators alike stood transfixed by the sheer magnificence of the orcas as they powered
towards Bush Point
, no more than a few yards from shore, leaving everyone wide-eyed and breathless at the close proximity of this exhilarating encounter. -Sandra Pollard
*
When I heard the
137s and the 46s were traveling together
, I so badly wanted to see them as I adore both of those families, AND they have some of my favorite boys - I can't help it, I'm a sucker for the big orca males. My heart swooned getting to see
T137A, T46D and T46E swimming together
yesterday! They graced us with a fairly close pass by
Bush Pt
- it felt so good to be back out chasing whales from the shores of beautiful Whidbey. -Rachel Haight
*

18:03 - Orcas, about at Bush Point now
.

17:40 - Orcas, on the Whidbey side of the channel, about half way up Mutiny Bay

HUMPBACK WHALES -

Entry 7:
Humpback Whale

Entry 8:
18:48 -
My friend just texted me to tell me that she spotted a juvenile
gray whale in the inner Quartermaster Harbor
approx one hour ago. -Pam Wise
*
DOLPHINS -

Entry 9:
15:45 -
Kit Hardrock sent a photo taken from about 100' away along the
Ruston Way waterfront in Tacoma
. Kit was pretty sure it was an orca and it looks like it, but It's difficult to say 100% if this is an orca or possibly one of the dolphins seen in the area for weeks.
ID comment from Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "I received numerous reports last night and today from Ruston, Commencement Bay, and even Thea Foss Waterway. Some of the pictures were ID quality, and it is Stump. She likes to feed in the shallows, and is often very close to shore. She also spent years in San Francisco Bay, and doesn't seem to bothered by areas with high boat traffic."
