Orca Sightings for August 24, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod, J38 Cookie & L87 Onyx made a quick crossing of the Juan De Fuca Strait
to be very close to Point No Point
west of Sooke
on our next adventure! They were all spread out foraging. Again it was great to only have 2-3 boats around who were happy to keep their distance to just enjoy the day! They quickly turned west and headed out to sea...SEPTEMBER is MY favorite! Heading east slowly as they foraged on Chinook Salmon. Very special to be the only boat around for miles-Paul Pudwell

The surface tension of the water has yet to break in this photo of
T99B surfacing in San Juan Channel
right off the rocks at Reuben Tarte County Park this afternoon. (San Juan Island) -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, Aug 24, 2018

Entry 2:
~

14:50-

15:00 - Saw 2 whales
today coming out of
Trincamoli through Montague heading toward Victoria, BC
...Unfortunately I was so mesmerized by the enormity and height of the first one's fin, I didn't look closely at them to determine if 2 males or mother and son. There were whale watching boats in the area. -Connie S Poppino
(
possibly the
T101s

Entry 3:
13:50 - Lots of transients
in the Salish Sea through
Baynes Channel near Discovery Island
, BC and have boats with them on AIS. They appear to be heading east across Haro towards San Juan Island. The
T99s
were seen close to shore on the
west side of Blakely Island around noon
(possibly they were the ones seen near Cattle Pass early this morning?).

13:30 T65A3 and T65A4
(just two whales) were seen heading north near
Fisherman Bay on Lopez Island
. Another shot of
T99B
on
August 24th as the
T99s
passed right off the rocks at Reuben Tarte - look at those deep rake marks at the top of the dorsal. -Monika Wieland Shields

14:22 - Orcas off Orcas Island
...we just saw a couple orcas (small ones) going SW by the island. We were on the coast near the Champagne Champagne storefront (near
Orcas ferry terminal/Harney Channel
) Boats were following quite closely (boo,) so they were moving pretty quickly. Will try to attach the media I was able to take. So amazing. Thanks for doing what you do!! -Leah Willoughby
(
Probably that was the
T99s
going west. - Monika Wieland Shields

HUMPBACK WHALES -

Entry 4:
13:13 - BCX1251 - Orion
is back! East side of
Rock Pile
. -Renee Beitzel

Entry 5:
off Port of Everett
in the shallow water. Looks like 2 of them. (
Discussion:
gray whale
who has been feeding in that area, when on his side feeding his fluke and pec fins are above surface and looks like multiple whales
) That sounds like it. Traveled north toward Camano Island. I took some video, will look at it later and see if it's it worth sharing. -Brad Redmond
