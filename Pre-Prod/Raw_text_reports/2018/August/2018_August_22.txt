Wed Aug 22 - Trip Report: Still very smokey as we left the marina, but got a report of Orcas off Dungeness Spit, so we headed southwest. We caught up with the
T65A group of Biggs (meat-eating) Orcas at Protection Island
, and followed them into Discovery Bay. This matriline consists of T65A, the matriarch (b. 1986), son T65A2 (2004: just 14 and very big!), T65A3 (2007), T65A4 (2011) and new calf T65A5 (born
April 2018). T65A and 3 of the others were heading into Discovery Bay, with long down times, and T65A2 was bringing up the rear. He made a kill of a harbor porpoise without too much seeming effort, and proceeded towards the others though still behind. It was lovely to see this tight family, with the darling calf looking fat and energetic. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
