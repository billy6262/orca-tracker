Orca Sightings for August 9, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -
Sometime
between
8:50 and
9:10 one female with a calf close by appeared, followed by two females/juveniles
. Very possible that I missed it if there was a male with them, it was almost completely dark over most of the water and they were traveling fast. Female that was with a calf was doing tail lob after tail lob...this was at land bank and they were headed south quickly. -Cassie Barclay

Entry 2:
22:30 NOAA Update: J50/Scarlet
Update (8/9): Progress! Response teams today reached
J Pod in Canadian waters and followed them into U.S. waters near San Juan Island
. While very skinny and small,
J50/Scarlet kept up well
with her mother and siblings. Veterinarian Marty Haulena from the Vancouver Aquarium got a thorough look at her and the team obtained a breath sample that will help assess any infection. They also administered a dose of antibiotics through a dart. Next step is to determine whether to proceed with trial feeding, depending on conditions and the location of the whales. Great work by the teams on the water!

15:30 Update: J50/Scarlet
(8/9) Update: Teams have refined their stepwise treatment strategy and priorities and are ready if they encounter J50 / Scarlet. They laid out the steps this way:
> Collect breath sample (via long pole)
> Collect fecal sample (scooped from the water)
> Other sampling of mucus and/or skin if practical (via long pole)
> Simultaneously complete visual veterinary health assessment
> Provide antibiotic treatment through pole system or dart
Once all of those are complete, then the teams will consider using live fish as a means to provide medical treatment to support her critical condition. If they decide to attempt that unprecedented step, they would first conduct a trial release of live fish to see if she will take the fish. The team would release fish from a vessel through a chute about 50 to 100 yards in front of J50/Scarlet. If she takes it, the team will discuss delivering oral medications inserted into the live fish based on the outcomes of the veterinary assessment. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast

HUMPBACK WHALES -
Thu 8/9 Trip Report: In bright, warm sunshine we left Cap Sante and headed northwest through beautiful Pole Pass, through the heart of the San Juan Islands. We found lovely
humpback BCZ0180 "Monarch" in President's Channel
, generally heading southwest. He/she did some very nice fluke up tail dives, giving us a good look at the beautiful pattern on the underside of the tail fluke, the identifying marks. We then headed to Flattop Island and saw a lot of adorable fat harbor seals, and and eagle family, with two mature mates, and at least one juvenile with a mottled brown and white feather pattern. Beautiful day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

Entry 4:
A gray whale has been feeding along the eastern shore of Port Susan Bay between Spee-Bi-Dah Beach and Tulare.
We have seen a whale twice recently - on
July 22 and again on
August 9. Of course we are not sure it was the same whale, but here is a picture of the one we saw
August 9 taken with a telephoto lens.
