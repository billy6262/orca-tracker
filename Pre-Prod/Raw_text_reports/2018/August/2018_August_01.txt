August 1 Trip Report: With reports of both Resident and Transient Orcas to the north, we took the beautiful route on the east side of Guemes and Orcas Islands. After a stop at Puffin Island to see harbor seals and five eagles, we caught up with our friends from Monday, the
T18/19 family of Transients at Saturna Island
. The sun came out as we watched the two females and two big males make giant loops around us. The Residents were headed north, so we made our way back to the marina to end another lovely day in the Salish Sea. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
