August 16th trip report - With smoky haze still lingering, we headed north in Rosario Strait towards whales, but heard a report of
whales much closer - at Deception Pass
! We turned back and found
Transient/Biggs whales - T101s and T102
! We had some amazing views of these 4 whales as they slowly traveled towards Lopez Island. Mom and her 3 kids are in excellent condition, there's lots of food available for them (seals, sea lions, porpoise etc.). Homeward bound we passed many seals hauled out on various rock formations, plus glimpses of harbor porpoise, and always, a few bald eagles. We forgot about the haze during this spectacular day - well done Capt. Eric!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

12:34 - T101s have pushed SW off Deception pass
and offshore. -Rachel Haight

.

just circled back. I think they're hunting in the tide rips.

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES -

Entry 5:
23:01-
Hello! I am Sitting on my deck of a summer rental home.
Watauga Beach, Manchester, Wa, Rich Passage
, I
hear blow hole breathing
, really strong breathes. Holy cats! Not a seal or sea lion. Big lungs, making huge ring of the rise, rises. Whale is going back and forth, lunging and flopping. First I zeroed in on one, in the dark! Then, saw there were two others ahead of my initial spot. I saw a Small dorsal fin on one via my binos. There are lots of salmon running through this pass right now. i'll stay up and report more, if more. Here's what struck me: The "largeness" of the splashing; They moved slow and long; once I realized there was more than one, how spread out they were. lots of loud; The biggee: How loud their breathing was. I've had the great blessing of hearing orcas and their blow holes from our family's boat when we've gone still in the water. As you know, once you hear that sound, you never forget it!! Also, there are many pinniped out front (harbor seals..I believe-) and I've heard their breathing. This was not them. I really believe this, after a night of sleep: That one dorsal fin, seen by me, in front of the neighbors house, with their porch light helping vision with my binos...was just too big not to be a female orca. Fyi, Not, the big giant male fin. -Kathleen Cage
