Entry 5:
T65As (minus T65A3 & T65A4)
- I was listening to the Orcas from the
West shore of Day Island
. They were off the Northeast shore of Fox Island from about

10:30-
11:15 pm
Friday. Sounds like they had a kill. Tail slapping and lots of blows in the same area for about a half hour or more. I'm pretty sure they went
North towards Tacoma around
11:15
. A train and a passing barge made too much noise but it sounded like they were heading North under the
Narrows Bridge at
11:20
or so. Here is a video of some of the blows I heard. You can't see anything but you can definitely hear the Orcas. -Karen Caldwell

18:00 - Saw 4 near Cutts Island in Henderson Bay
. Looked like two adult and two smaller ones. (heading south). -Doug Brennan

The Orca Network's (volunteer) text alert woke me up with news I had orcas heading my way. I managed to get out the door quickly and spent from

8:30-
9:30am
watching them head our way and pass the east side of
Anderson Island
, heading south.
T65A2
was on a trajectory to come close to us on shore, but turned and rejoined his mom and siblings to pass closer to Ketron Island. What an amazing way to start the day!

*
Not sure if your researchers would be interested but we saw
2 whales
in front of our house just west and close to shore of
Elliott Bay Marina
in Seattle on Friday evening. Unfortunately it looks like we only caught one in our pictures. Any idea who they are from the fins? We did see a couple of harbor seals swimming around about 15-30 minutes before the whales, but haven't seen them since the whale sightings. We have lived here for 8 years and have never seen whales so close to the shore before. We are quite interested especially since our trip to San Juans with an afternoon of whale watching in June where we saw several whales. So any information you can share would be appreciated. T65A3 glides passed the Elliot Bay Marina heading towards downtown Seattle. -Troy Sorensen

19:14 - Orcas
off of four mile rock (
Magnolia

north of Elliot Bay
Marina. Transients hunting. No direction. -Joey LaMarche

19:30 -
I was in a kayak off
Magnolia
, saw the
two Orcas
just off W McGraw Shoreline Street End south of Discovery park. They were in the same area for about 15 minutes at around
7:30 pm. Headed south from there. -Thaddaus Huber
*

18:32 - T65A3 & T65A4
have made at least one kill since being here

18:21 - T65A3 & T65A4
southbound just south of Discovery Park.

Entry 7:

10:09 - Two orcas
approached the dock at the Beach Camp at
Sunset Bay between Mukilteo and Edmonds
, very close to the dock and beach where 60 campers and many staff were able to see them for about five minutes. Photos are posted at that facebook page but so far no saddle patches have been posted. The RP, Francie Dailer, suggested they were the missing
T065A3 & 4

Entry 11:
18:30 - whale spouts seen in Case Inlet
, between Heron and Harstine Island. Currently heading south. Also seen
earlier today around 3pm
in similar location. Not orca. Much bigger, no idea what kind. (Carla Jones: David's wife here. I told him to post it was a small gray whale, but he refused because it was too far away to really know. But that's my vote.) -David Morton
*
Gray whale
out front again this morning. It headed south
toward Boston Harbor and Budd Inlet
, in a set of slow and determined surfacing series - marked by robust blows. It then turned west and headed across the
tip of Cooper Point spit
where it remained for about 30 minutes - in what appeared to be feeding behavior. Slow surfacing and shallow breathing marked by a head here, a pectoral fin there, and tail fluke tip someplace else. It then started to travel south
into Eld Inlet
- where the first surface was highlighted by a robust blow as well as the startling of a dozen mergansers! It kept south for a short distance (about a mile) and then turned around and headed north again. As it passed in front of the house, it started to angle north east where I lost sight of it after its determined surfacing series - marked by robust blows again - as it traveled. Grateful! -Kim Merriman
