Entry 3:
K pod
was here! We were able to see the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales on all our Whale Watching Tours as they made their way down the coast! With only 18 members, K Pod is the smallest of the three pods in the SR community. It was a perfect day because we had guests on board a tour who really wanted to see Killer Whales! -The Whale Centre,

Entry 10:
Clinton about
1:30pm
(29th) heading towards the Clinton ferry dock. It was very large and it was on the surface for a short time, and at first we thought it was a log. Then it sounded and then came back up. Then our view of it was obstructed but it was traveling South. -Margaret Norling

10:48 a.m - Possible humpback in front of Mukilteo Ferry
headed towards Everett. I only saw the tails sit it dove, but it was huge. (edited with: It seemed more like a humpback but I only saw it for 2 seconds before it dove. I'll keep a lookout and post if I see it again). -Melissa Simmons, WSF

This (we think)
Gray Whale
was spotted in surprisingly shallow 15-25 foot depths close to the outer green buoy at the mouth of
Oak Harbor
today at

4:50 pm
(
June 29). -Patti McCoy

April 9th in that area and by all accounts has stayed in since - alb

Entry 11:
dolphin heading south past Edmonds Marina Beach
on Friday afternoon around

3:30pm.
I didn't have enough cell service to post a sighting, but we were excited! It was too far out but definitely alone not with any friends. It was pretty big as I spotted it from shore and wasn't really looking. -Karen Knight
