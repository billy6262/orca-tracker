Orca Sightings for June 27, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
...
J26
had been reported to be trailing the leaders but was well ahead of the trailing groups and we found him
mid-Haro Strait
at
1330
. J26 was traveling fast due north toward Land Bank. After a quick look at him, we moved ahead in the direction he was heading to see if we could find the rest of the J16s. We found the
J19s and J50
spread out near Edwards Point heading south. J26 appeared several hundred yards down island of the others and was now also heading slowly south....-See full report summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 40.
