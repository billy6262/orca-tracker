My family was canoeing between
Bainbridge Island and Blake Island
(Rich Passage) and came upon a bunch of
Orcas
, male included, around
7-
7:30
tonight. My daughter took this shaky video from the canoe. They turned around and paddles back to Fort Ward park....My husband said he
believed there were 5-7 orcas
and they were doing a lot of jumping. My family was headed to Blake Island but had to turn around because they the Orcas were between them and the island and the Port Orchard side of Rich Passage. My daughters said they for sure saw one male. There is no mistaking the dorsal. -Report by Amy Noel (see Facebook VIDEO by Natalie Noel)

We were at the Waterman dock in
Port Orchard and about 4 orca whales
(at least) were across the way next to Bremerton going towards the shipyard. They seemed to go along the shipyard towards Gorst and the last time we saw them (with binoculars) was right next to the shipyard kind of by the large crane. We stayed until dark hoping they would go back by but they didn't so I assume they are still down that way. No pictures because I only had my phone and they were hugging the Bremerton shoreline. Had at least one younger one in the group. Just swimming along, occasionally coming up like they do. Other people said they were feeding in Gorst. -Dawn Banks
*

7:38 p.m. - Looks like 5-7 orca
in one group. Possibly second group. passing Waterman Pier in

Two pods off Bremerton Ferry terminal
On Saturday, our late

6:45pm
sailing from Seattle-Bremerton (departed at

7:00pm
), was close to it's arrival location at the Bremerton Ferry terminal. The captain announced that there as an orca pod off our starboard bow. There was, and it seemed to have a calf among them. There were perhaps
4-5 individuals in that pod
. Then, we saw another group directly in front of the boat.
That group had about 4-5 individuals as well
. Just NE of Bremerton Ferry terminal (Sinclair Inlet). -Shari Tallarico

a big group he said was "heading up Rich Passage

June 16 - thanks for all of your work. Love reading the sightings reports. We were lucky enough to see
orcas off of the east coast of Haida Gwaii
last week while on vacation. My partner got a pretty good video of one - think it was a juvenile as it checked out the boat. Do you know anyone who would want the sighting report? Think we were too far north for your organization, right?... Great. Here you go: Sat, 6/16,
mid-afternoon
, east coast of Louise Island or the vicinity. - We were observing a group of
5-6 orcas
; split to the far right and left sides of our zodiak (guided trip); right group was a larger juvenile or female and younger juvenile(s) and the left group was an adult male and another large female. - the left group moved slowly south tail slapping repeatedly - the right group of youngsters was all over the place w one good breach. - Our guide kept us 300-400 meters away. He/we def knew not to approach or chase. - The group of 2-3 on our right starting getting a bit closer; the guide had stopped moving the boat just left the motor on. - then all of a sudden tone whale from the right group gave our boat a close up before continuing south and eventually both groups joined up again and continued slowly heading south. First video is the close encounter. Second video is really far, but you can just make out a tail slap and the bull's fin. -Sarah Chesson

ID notes by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research: "It is a transient (photo below)...I just watched them (videos). No IDs for them I am afraid."

June 16 - Hello, we took our boat out yesterday and some whales found us. We were taken by surprise videos are very good. However we can't figure out what kind of whales we saw. I was hoping you could help us with your knowledge? We were
between Hat Island and Jetty Island
Saturday night at around

6:30
. Thank you for any help you can give! (confirmed
gray
per video) Thank you so much! This was only our second time heading out that way and we're so surprised. It was a great first day of summer for our 10 year old! -Erin J Tredway
