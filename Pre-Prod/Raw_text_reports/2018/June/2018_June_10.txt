Orca Sightings for June 10, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Juan de Fuca - MIND BLOWN! 5 minutes from our docks in
Sooke
. Cpt. Dan spotted some beautiful blows a mile out and we were surprised to find 3 or more Transient Killer Whale Pods heading towards shore very fast on the hunt for Pinnipeds...they continued to zig zag all around slowly heading east. Will take some time to identify these amazing Orca tonight. Great to sea this T PARTY TODAY!
T100 and T100F, T100C, T100E, T102 off Sooke. T101B, T101, and T86A off Sooke.. T75A

Entry 2:
T49A's, T75B's and T75C's by Patos
. We set sail in beautiful conditions heading north through the islands into Presidents Channel. We saw many harbor seals hauled out on Bare Island as we crossed towards Patos Island to meet up with the socializing orcas,
T49A's (minus T49A1) and sisters, T75B's and T75C's
. Blue skies became bordered by heavy black clouds and localized rain storms. Reefing the sails as conditions changed as the whales were milling in circles. Eventually the whales split up and headed south and we set course to visit Skipjack, White Rock and Flattop Islands. Gently sailing in the lee of Flattop while enjoying our BBQ supper. Spectacular skies and a rainbow as we headed for home. -David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
