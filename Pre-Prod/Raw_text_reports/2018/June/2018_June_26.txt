Entry 6:
8:58 am -
Spotted a whale with a small dorsal fin in
Elliott Bay
directly off of
Myrtle Edwards Park
. Couldn't ID but would guess about 30 feet long. Heading south. Dove when a tugboat passed by....I have a limited view so I'm guessing it was out of my lateral viewing range by the time it surfaced again. If I had to guess I'd say it was a Minke, but I'm no expert. Seems likely that others in downtown would have seen it, too. -Leo Muller

Humpbacks
