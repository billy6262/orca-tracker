6/24 Trip Report: Another spectacular day! First we saw some fat harbor seals, then caught up with the
T137
family very quickly, just past
Fidalgo Head
south of Allen Island. We followed them
under the Deception Pass Bridge
, and watched as they made a kill on the north side of Strawberry Island. And then they attempted to go back out under the bridge, but against a very strong tide! They were going full power, with lunges and huge exhalations, but at one point were actually being pushed backwards! They finally made it, and headed southwest into the fog. We headed out to find a humpback at Colville Island, and followed him/her through alternating sun and fog east, and lost him/her in the fog at Burrows Island.

12:50 p.m. -
Just received word the
T137s
