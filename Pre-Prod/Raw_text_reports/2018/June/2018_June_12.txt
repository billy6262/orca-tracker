============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod and part of L pod - 15-20 Residents between Pender and Salt Spring
, through Active Pass and out into the Gulf! We saw every behavior! Breaches, cartwheels, pec slaps, tail slaps, porpoising- saw about 13 breaches in total (have pictures of about 8-10 of them). -Sydney Gass

Entry 3:

11:10 a.m -
relocated to friends to see the
Ls spread out in Spieden Channel heading west
at good clip. Mid channel and Spieden Island side primarily. Some moved over and looked to be heading SW as if to head south in Haro but then all stalled. Unclear at this time which direction they were committed as the whales were pretty spread out with those visible going in different directions.
(
Per Monika Wieland Shields:
L4s, L26s, L47s, L72s went Spieden
that day. They did not split Spieden - there was a humpback in New Channel. They went north to where Js were but Js went Swanson and Ls went Boundary
.)

10:45 a.m. -
arrived at Reuben Tarte Park to see fins across south end
Presidents Channel
, seemingly headng south. Short time later seemed to stall and then aim west looking like towards Spieden Channel. Those of us gathered on the rocks watched as they picked up speed making good time. Was some confusion, looked like pod may have split Spieden as some WW boats were splitting Spieden. Whatever was happening, we eventually could see many orcas heading towards Spieden Channel. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 4:
L12s -
A very special day! As we were leaving the docks we got a report from one of our local fisherman that there were Orca coming our way and within a few minutes Cpt. Dan spotted our beloved
Southern Killer Whales (L12's)
right out front of Sooke! After visiting them we also had the pleasure to head a couple miles south to a family of Transient Killer Whales.
L89 Solstice off Sooke heading west. L41 Mega off Sooke heading west.
