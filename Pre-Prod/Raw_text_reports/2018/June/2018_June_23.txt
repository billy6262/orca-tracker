Entry 2:
Boundary Pass - T49As & T65As
- After spending some time up north with the
T124As in Active Pass
we headed back south where the
T49As, T65As and T137s
were traveling together around the San Juans. By the time we got with them approx.
12:20 the T137s had split off and headed south and the T49As and T65As were heading eastbound in Boundary Pass on the US side,
north side of Waldron Island off Sandy Point
. These families were beautifully grouped and pretty much were just traveling at a good pace and continued that way for the ~ 25 minutes we were with them. At some point they zig-zagged north and then back east again... we last saw these families heading northeasterly near
north side of Skipjack Island about
12:45

Entry 3:
Enterprise Reef through Active Pass - T124As & T124A2s
- A friend and I headed north up to the Gulf Islands with Maya's Legacy aboard J1 in hopes of seeing whales in places we have never explored. Approx. 30 minutes off the dock we got word there were orcas at Enterprise Reef off the west side of Mayne Island, BC heading northbound. We arrived shortly after
11:00, watched them pass in front of the Mayne Island ferry and take a right into Active Pass. Once in the pass they zig- zagged, made several directional changes in some of the currents (initially we thought they were on a kill) then moved on traveling the pass grouped up at a steady pace. They cleared the pass about 30 minutes later where we watched this lovely family continue north in front of the Galiano Island ferry dock. We then we turned and headed back west through Active and headed south to Boundary Pass to spend some time with another group of orcas. Thank you to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for IDs: T124As with the T124A2s. -Alisa Lemire Brooks (w/ Gayle Swigart)

She is back in the cove again now. This one was hanging out in
Driftwood Cove
area, inland and just North of Raft Island today. It hung around alone for quite some time! Gray, with a very rounded head, traveling alone. It jumped 10-12 times & stalled my son who was out kayak fishing for a while, then headed North toward
Purdy

3pm
