Orca Sightings for June 14, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Islands were joined together in this morning's extreme low tide. We navigated inside Turn Island watched by three raccoons in a tree and caught the tail end of the ebb out through Cattle Pass. We'd been listening to spectacular calls and echolocation of
Southern Resident orcas on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. We are very concerned they may not be finding enough to eat so we're hopeful, hearing the echolocation, that they're finding Chinook salmon. We arrived to find them milling and then traveling with some social cuddle puddles, breaches and spy hops. The
J16's
turned towards us and vocalized into our hydrophone. We continued on the flood to circumnavigate San Juan Island taking a course north of Spieden and Flattop Islands. We spotted many eagles nests one with eaglets noticeably larger than last week and now stretching their wings. -Barbara & David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing (see encounter and photos on their blog post HERE)
