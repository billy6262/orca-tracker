Entry 2:
(

- ID confirmation by Melisa Pinnow, CWR
)

Entry 3:
At
sunset orcas Ls were offshore of False Bay
going SW. -Monika Wieland Shields

6:45 p.m. - Some still approaching Edwards Point
after some directional changes while fighting the tide and currents. Some individuals were fairly close in (including sprouter/older open saddle male) while others remained further out. Several have rounded the point out of view and would be
off Hannah Heights
. The currents really picked up in the past many minutes off off the point, massive turbulence, so stunning.

6:05 p.m -
After looking like they might be heading offshore, while passing Landbank pullouts we could see
many have stayed in
. From southern pullout we can see at least 1/2 dozen directly out from us right now. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

It looked to me like just the
remaining Ls came down (L4s, L26s, L47s, L72s)
and not the Js. They were all past Lime Kiln by
~
17:45
still southbound.

17:00 - Leaders at Lime Kiln.

5:00 p.m -
5:45 p.m. -
Relocated to
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
, see orcas still to the north, off
Bellevue Point
. For nearly an hour watched them stream past Lighthouse still spread widely (primarily in 1-3s) from inshore to offshore, steady pace southbound in rough seas and beautiful sunshine.
By

4:30 p.m.-
a few who were closest in and leading were porpoising off the north end of
County Park
.

4:10 p.m -
Seeing bodies now...orcas appear in a line spread form fairly close inshore to ~ 1 mile offshore coming down island, leaders currently at the southend of
Open Ba
y. Choppy seas.

3:44 p.m. -
We just arrived at
County Park,
have visual on WW boats off Henry Island with more boats showing up around the bluff. Begin seeing blows minutes later...hard to see in the chop but periodically blows stand out spread from inshore to ways off. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

15:30 - leaders nearing Henry Island
southbound. It is Residents!

14:30 - Possible SRKWs at Turn Point southbound
. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 4:
orcas have gone through Active Pass. Between 2 and 4 pm
, a large group of
transients
approached from the west, showing some breaches, tail slaps, and cartwheels. They went through the pass east bound, almost exited, then turned around. Went into Miner's Bay, moved slowly along the shore of Mayne Island, then turned again and went eastward. One small group made one more tour around the pass before they left. At one point, the downpour almost obscured them.

Entry 5:
a humpback whale near Cattle Pass
, and a big group of playful
transient killer whales in Swanson Channel
! The transient group included the
T34s, T37s (all of them!), and the T77s
. -Justine Buckmaster

Entry 6:
1:15 -
1:45 p.m -
Still watching the
Cattle Pass whale
continue south, currently SE of Green Can at Salmon Bank now heading SW. Tentative ID CS513 Anvil. No luck sighting any other whales.

12:45 p.m. - Humpback cleared Cattle Pass
a bit ago and has continued southbound. We heard there was another Humpback (would make 3rd) off Eagle Point heading down Island about an hour ago, we are moving over to South Beach to see if we can locate that one while keeping an eye on this one.

12:15 p.m. -
Whale is traveling steady surface intervals, sounding and presenting fluke. In
Cattle Pass
just north of Whale Rocks. (see Marilyn's photos below)

12:05 p.m. - Humpback heading southbound just north of Goose Island on San Juan Island side of San Juan Channel
. Viewing from Cattle Point, San Juan Island. (Keeping and eye out too for 2nd whale reported south of Lopez heading this way). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
Saw
a whale
on the ferry almost when we were pulling into
Friday harbor
...wasn't sure what it was but this might've been the whale that was spotted! (re; above sighting) we were about 10 minutes or so away from pulling into the ferry dock at San Juan from Anacortes. It was roughly around
11:30am on the left side of the boat. It definitely wasn't an orca that's for sure... the dorsal fin was super small. Couldn't tell how big the whale was...the ferry made an announcement about a whale on the port side but I guess they couldn't tell what kind of whale it was as they made no mention except for whale port side. -Gianna Cioffi

Entry 7:
6:15 p.m. - Two humpbacks off Three Tree Point
(Burien), mid channel, heading north. Looks to be a mama and a calf possibly? I tried to get pictures but they had some really long down times and I was just so happy to see them that I stayed in the moment. -Kim Baumgartner
*
(in reply to above report) We saw them (
humpbacks
) last evening (13th) about the same time off
Seahurst
. Unfortunately no, the sighting was very brief but exciting! We saw a larger whale and a smaller one beside it heading south close to mid-channel. The larger whale blew and they both dove. Gone from our sight in an instant. -Cindy Eckes Waddington
