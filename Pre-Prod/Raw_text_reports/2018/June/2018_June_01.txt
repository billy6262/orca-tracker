Orca Sightings for June 1, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were
several groups of orcas
in the area today. While we were en route to see the
T65A's near Lopez
, another group, the
T49A's, were found closer over by Long Island
. The whales were engaged in hunting as we arrived but soon we moved on to circumnavigate Lopez Island. It was incredible watching this orca family weave in and out of the islands on the rugged southern Lopez coastline. The orcas stopped to hunt at least two more times while we sailed with them, and at one point we heard some vocals over our hydrophone. Some play time after dinner and then it was time to move on. They departed
out through Thatcher Pass
while we continued around to Upright Head. -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
