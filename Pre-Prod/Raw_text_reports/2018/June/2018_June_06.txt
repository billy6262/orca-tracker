3:40 p.m -
I work for Parks Canada (Gulf Islands). At the end of my day we saw 4 whale watchers following
4 or 5 orca
between Piers Island and Portland Island (off
Swartz Bay
)...steadily cruising along: slow regular surfacing. (we may have seen this same group a week ago off the south end of Pender Island AND at that time it appeared they may have had a calf of the year with them) weren't close enough to get a good look today....steady travel; 4 whale watching boats, 2 on each side, somewhat controlling their direction, but adequate distance from the whales. -Frank Gee

This afternoon I got to spend some time with the
T124A's in front of Sooke
. They were heading Westbound when they turned South by Secretary Island and Possession Point. -Deanna Brett
*
Another great day on Saratoga! We met up with the
T124As with T124A2s just outside Victoria
today. Some tail action by
T124A2A
; notice the unique notch. The youngsters in the group were super active and we were even treated to a surprise close pass while the engines were shut down. The conditions were wonderful, too! -Justine Buckmaster

Thought I would pass this along...my friend Janet Ulin spied
Orcas in the middle if the Straits of Juan Dr Fuca
, so she put the binoculars on them and managed to get this breaching shot, just crazy. She said she counted about 6 or 7 of them. I know that is close to Victoria...and that it was about
1130
. There ended up being a whale sight seeing boat right with them too, so hopefully someone comes up with more info on them. And she said she watched them for about a half hour and they were heading east and up towards the San Juan islands. -Sandy Thompson Watne

Entry 5:
3:12 p.m -
There is definitely 6! One of which is a calf!

2:53 p.m -
I can count a total 5 or 6, with one large male about 1/2 mile east of the main group. Now they are less than 100 yards off of Point Robinson Park on the East side of Vashon.

2:46 p.m -
I'm with them now across from Des Moines, they are closer to the Vashon side. Headed north bound. -Matt Graham
*

1:00 p.m. -
Not really traveling in any specific direction. They're hanging in the middle (basically on the ferry path), close to some boats. Still mid channel between Pt D and Vashon.

12:46 p.m - 3 orcas spotted mid channel between Vashon Island and Point Defiance
. Seen from Gig Harbor side. -Gaby Kinner
*

12:16 p.m. - at least 2
confirmed.

12:06 p.m. - Orcas Tacoma side under Narrows
headed north...Idk how many I'm waiting for a resurface for a good confirmation but the blow spout and splash was too big for a porpoise. -Jami Cantrell
*

12:04 p.m. -
Just saw them splashing quite a bit
north of the Narrows Bridge
again, on the Tacoma side.

11:52 p.m. - Saw two Orcas heading south just north of the Narrows Bridge
. -Allison Stewart Bishins
