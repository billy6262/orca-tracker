After hanging N around
Foulweather Bluff
for quite awhile, accompanied by 1-2 WW boats, Two groups suddenly came S between
12-
12:40 pm
. All were SB with at least 4 in the lead group that torpedoed around the point well ahead of the WW boats, followed by group of 3 including young one that paused on a kill on N side of Lighthouse before continuing around the point SB. PSE boat was with that group. Both groups passed 75-100 yards off PNP. I'll post a few pics and one shaky video. Blood in the water from trailing group's kill N of Lighthouse. Group included a young one. Did not see what they got, but there were quite a few harbor porpoises right in that zone. Harbor seals were on shore and hugging shore as well. -Donna Van Renselaar

Was out with the Puget Sound Express out of Edmonds (aboard
2:30 departure) and we had a pod of
6-7 transients just north of Kingston
. We kept with them for a bit before following a
humpback in the same area
. We met back up with the same pod just outside of Port Madison where they had just made a kill which appeared to be a harbor seal. Lots of spyhopping, tail lobbing, and a few breaches and backflips by the youngsters. Hunting, feeding, and playing. -Alex Polk
