============================================================

Entry 1:
Eastern Juan de Fuca -

6:15 p.m. - Single male orca
north bound
3 miles northwest of Point Wilson
. Didn't get an ID, but definitely a Transient. -Justine Buckmaster
*
June 9 - There were transient orcas everywhere today - including outside of Friday Harbor. Barbara Howitt and Erin Corra took the skiff out to get a look at the orcas at a different perspective before meeting up with David Howitt on Peniel. The
T75B's and T75C's were with the T49A's minus T49A1 traveling up San Juan Channel
. He split off with the others
(T65A's & T37A's) who decided to take Upright Channel instead
. Interesting lighting conditions as a distant rain cloud headed our direction. The T49A's hugged the Orcas coastline while the T75B's and C's were on the opposite side of Presidents Channel near Waldron. Rains came and went and we headed for home under blue skies. -Barbara & David, All Aboard Sailing

Entry 2:
2:30pm -
Rosario Strait
then along the east side of Lummi Island - Saw a pod of maybe
7-10 individuals
comprised of females and at least one calf. Our guide thought they were transient and estimated the calf at 9 months. We followed them in Rosario Straight as they headed north. Later, we came across two males, also heading north past Lummi Island! Traveling mostly. They would do several shallow dives and comes up for air over and over and then dive under for a few minutes at a time before resurfacing. We saw 2 males and altogether around 10 individuals! -Celeste Hufford
(
ID Notes: several photos reviewed by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: " That's the
T37As and T65As. T49A1 and T65A2
were hanging out together well away from their groups for most the afternoon."
)

Entry 3:
Rosario Strait
, within 30 minutes of leaving the marina! Many
Transient/Bigg's orcas spread out across the Strait
, generally heading southwest. We joined up with the
T37s and T102
(male, born 1984) and watched them travel and play. We then took a break to see seals and head into Deception Pass, always a treat! We then found the
T100 matriline, mother T100 (born 1978) and her family, plus two big males
. They made a kill and celebrated with a big spy hop. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

, near the north Vashon terminal, heading northeast toward Seattle, reported by Casey Irving.

Entry 6:
5-10 porpoises were NW from the Mukilteo ferry terminal at the
4:40
sailing along with a younger looking grey whale that was traveling towards the Clinton terminal when we took off from Whidbey....Milling about 50 yards from shore in a northern direction...It had a lot of barnacles on its back and looked much smaller than a humpback. I wish I would have had enough time to get photos. I've never seen porpoises before yesterday and the whale was so close! -Shelsea Eney
