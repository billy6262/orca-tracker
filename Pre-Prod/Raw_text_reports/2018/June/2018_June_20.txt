Entry 6:
9:20 a.m - Swanson Channel
off Fulford Harbour:
5 or 6 orca
seen off Fulford Harbour (Saltspring Island) this morning. 1 lg male and 4 or 5 females appeared to be fishing, taking 5 minute dives. A BC Ferry passed close by, they shifted to mid channel then to entrance of Fulford Harbour, then finally headed west towards Saanich Inlet. they seemed to be fishing taking long dives (5-10 minutes). First sighting was between Portland and Piers Islands; about 1 nm off Portland and Brackman. A Gulf Islands BC ferry passed close by then they moved to mid channel and towards the entrance to Fulford Harbour, then continued west. A small number of boats (only 1 or 2 at a time) observed. No ID or photos. -Frank Gee

Entry 7:
11 pm
I am 99% sure I heard a whale as it went past our house, west shore of
Day Island
. It was definitely not a sea lion or seal. Couldn't see it but I heard it.
Maybe the humpbacks
going South? -Karen Caldwell
*
I was enjoying dinner at Anthony's at
Point Defiance
in Tacoma, and a spotted
a couple whales make their way across Commencement Bay
between the ferry Crossing of Point Defiance and Vashon Island and saw them surface a good 20 to 30 times over the course of 30 minutes. -Dale Seitz
*
3 humpbacks in Commencement Bay
, Tacoma this evening.

6:30pm -
7:30pm.
Browns Point Light House to Jack Hyde Park, then in toward the port. They swam in and out of the Wednesday night sail boat races out of Tyee. Whales were all but touching each other as they would roll for air. Mellow pace. Long dives. Last sight of them was moving north/ east across mount of port, back toward NE Tacoma side. -Dean Burke
*
~ 1830 - Sighted two grays (probably the humpbacks) spouting off Ruston Way
. Initial direction of travel was eastbound towards Foss Waterway. Second sighting of same whales at
2000
headed westbound out into commencement bay towards Point Defiance...t's entirely possible that they were the humpbacks you're talking about. I'm not exactly great at identifying whales, and tonight's cetacean sensation was no exception to this. It was a total treat to see though, without question. -Kaetlin Breen

Entry 8:
5:45 pm
near the south east tip of
Hat
. It appeared to be just one whale. Saw it blow at least 4 times. Could not tell what kind of whale it was. By the time we got close to where we saw the spouts it was gone. -Kim Vest Gleason
