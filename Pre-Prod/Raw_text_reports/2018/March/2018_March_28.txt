Entry 2:
*
T124C and T49A1 this afternoon in Spieden Channel
. It's fascinating to see two dispersed males from different family groups hanging out together, which is not uncommon. These two have been traveling throughout BC and Washington waters together for at least several days. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Entry 3:
gray whales #21 Shackleton and #22 Earhart
, we raced around Whidbey Island to catch up with the
T37As and the T99s
! We were surprised with a sudden close pass as the orcas left a kill, birds picking up scraps in their wake, and
raced toward Hood Canal
. Then, they slowed in an apparent resting line as they rounded Foulweather Bluff. What a great day, despite the rain!

11:28 a.m - They seem intent on heading into Hood Canal.
Now past Foulweather Bluff on the NE side. T37As are here too.

11:00 a.m. - At least the T99s
possibly others with them. They're heading straight for
Foulweather Bluff
now.

Entry 4:
Hi we have been watching several
(at least 6) Orca traveling south from Boiler Bay in Depoe Bay, Oregon
. We drove south to Otter Loop Rd just south of Rocky Creek in Depoe Bay and are still watching them travel south. We spotted them at

6:30 pm

March 28th and are still watching them now at
7:07 pm. Last sighting was at

7:30 pm
. A couple came in close to shore as an adult gray was about 30 yards from shore. The orca headed south after saying oh wait that gray doesn't have a calf with it. -Kent and Edith Hitchings

quietly feeding close to shore, while moving toward
