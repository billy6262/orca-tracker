12:15 pm- We saw a grey whale off Ebey's Landing beach
, Whidbey Island, about 50-yards offshore. It appeared to be a small whale - perhaps 15' of surface was visible when it surfaced. It was alone. We scanned the area with binoculars but didn't see any other whales nearby. The location was where the northern end of the hiking trail comes down the hillside to reach the beach. We watched the whale for about 15-minutes, and it moved in about a 100-yard area, surfacing occasionally...The fact that the grey whales present only part of their body is very interesting. That was our experience as we didn't see a head (or eye) or tail at all. The 'blow' was perhaps 10' high, not very tall. It was moving n/nw but not at any speed, more it was covering an area about 100-yards across, it seemed. The tide was ebbing. We didn't take photos, I'm sorry. The whale had a mottled grey, green, white-spotted surface color...-Bron Richards
