March 10 - (Opening Day!): We left Langley Marina on a beautiful, sunny morning, motoring out on glass smooth water, heading east toward Tulalip, with reports of a few of our "Sounders" gray whales in the area. We turned south toward the Snohomish River estuary, near Everett, and found
#49 Patch and #53 Little Patch, as well as a third, unidentified whale.
They were heading up into the estuary, which is quite shallow, so we briefly watched them do a little side fluke foraging. We then circumvented Gedney Island, and came back around as the tide came out, bringing the whales into deeper water. We got very good looks at these two whales' identifying marks, and finally (!) a nice fluke up dive by Little Patch. A great day and a great start for our whale watching season! -Bonnie Gretz, Volunteer Naturalist
