Orca Sightings for March 13, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
mid-Haro Strait off the north end of Land Bank at about 1700
. The whales were the
T2Cs, T46s, and T137s
and they had all been reported previously to be among the whales at Middle Bank. The whale watch boat "J1", who had been waiting for us to make sure we got on whales, still had other Ts down south of us in the gloom. We stuck with the northern groups who had been altogether when we first got on scene before the T2Cs split off and were traveling north fast about a quarter mile ahead of the T46s and T137s. T2C2 was not present with the T2Cs and it was not known how far behind the others he was. -Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 15.

March 13 - San Juan Channel - The amount of Bigg's Killer whales in the last few days is incredible!! They seem to like coming in during spring to form social groups. Around here, we call that a "T-party". T for Transient Killer whale, though we use "Bigg's" and "transient" interchangeably as both refer to the fact that these are mammal-eating Killer whales. This the
T18's
. I became aware of them
outside Friday Harbor about 2pm
. They worked their way north in San Juan Channel for a portion of the day before heading off to the northeast. A group I just love spending time with. It was really nice to see them today. Hopefully, they enjoy some social time with the other groups and stick around! -Traci Walter

Entry 2:
about 5 orcas in Discovery Bay
! And quite aways down the bay. We live off Holland Rd, 300 ft up, but could see them in the water. There were spoutings, breaching, diving and two big jumps out of the water. They were there for about 30 minutes (it was around 1pm) and then started heading north....Feeding, circling, a couple of jumps, swimming. 48°00'33.8"N 122°51'13.3"W The above is an estimated location, projecting from our house. What a special 'show' we'll never forget! -Mary & Paul Hootman
