Orca Sightings for March 9, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
...He headed over to CWR where he and Ken watched the whales, who looked like the
T2Cs
, through the scopes as they rounded Bellevue Point. Dave then left for Snug Harbor and left in the boat a little after
1700
. The boat got on scene about ten minutes later to find the
T2Cs milling off Low Island
. The whales took about a ten minute long dive before coming up right at Sunset Point...Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 12.

Entry 3:
Possession Sound -
3:55 p.m.
- A visitor to the Langley Whale Center reported Ferry captain announced there was
a gray whale in the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes
. No direction of travel, but he did include they may need to slow or stop for the whale to pass.
*

11:13 a.m. -
Hello, not sure what type but there is
a whale feeding just north of Mukilteo Ferry dock
. In the shallows maybe 200 yards offshore. I saw body and a blow twice. (presuming gray - alb) -John Dooley
*
Bottlenose dolphin -

Entry 4:
Point Ruston
. Wondering what it is. We first saw it around
2pm
just outside of the Point Ruston development. It was going towards the Port of Tacoma, and we followed it as far as Cummings Park, till about
3pm
. Later, back at Point Ruston, we saw it there again around
6pm
. -Wayne Lattuca
(
"It is definitely a bottlenose and is NOT Miss... The new photos show a really distinctive bent dorsal fin, so it should make confirmation easier." - Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research
).
*

3:47 p.m. - Dolphin in Commencement Bay, heading west into Dalco Passage
. Definitely dolphin, dorsal shape consistent with Pacific white sided dolphin, but appeared very dark, couldn't see the shading to white... has a definite hook to the dorsal fin. It was dark in color. -Travis Goldman
Notes from Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research who reviewed Travis Goldman's photos (before we received Wayne's photo confirming bottlenose):
"We haven't had any reports of the bottlenose for several months. They did seem to like the area between Commencement Bay and Alki Point, so it is in the right area. The dorsal fin is the right shape for bottlenose, and the one picture with more of the body showing looks right for a bottlenose as well, but it would be really hard to say for sure. It doesn't look right for a common dolphin. We still don't have any good ID shots for any bottlenose other than Miss.
The common dolphins that have been seen in the South Sound for the last couple years were recently seen near McNeil Island, so they are still around. Before that, there haven't been any reports since the fall. We haven't personally seen them since late summer, even though we try and make it out on the water at least once each month."

2:52 p.m. -
some sort of whale (
dolphin
) heading towards
Point Defiance
, filmed from Ruston Way. There were no white markings, it was a solitary, it looked smaller than an adult orca...It looked dolphinish. It did have a dorsal fin. It looked like a black beluga whale. -Rich DuBois
