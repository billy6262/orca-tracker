Entry 4:
9:30 a.m. - 1-2 groups past Friday Harbor (included the T100s, T124s, T101s, and T49s - alb)

about an hour later this group (T137s, T46s and T46Bs) came by and the T2Cs. And the T60s were interisland near Westsound.
It is hard to keep track. THIS VIDEO has T137s, T46s and T46Bs in it. T-party palooza up here today!!!! Unreal! -Traci Walter, Western Prince

Entry 5:
Admiralty Inlet -
7:25 p.m.
- they have moved closer to mid-channel and Kitsap side, but only as far as
half way between Foulweather Bluff and Skunk Bay
, with slow movement to the south. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

7:25 p.m. -
From Limpett Lane straight out from here at
Foulweather Bluff
. At the same time one came up near Double Bluff channel marker closer to Whidbey.

7:09 p.m. -
From my vantage point they are still
north of Foulweather Bluff
seems to be at a slow pace and down for longer times still moving southerly.

6:50 p.m. -
I see the blows in
between south Marrowstone and Foulweather Bluff mid channel
, sightline from where I'm standing at Limpett Lane (out Mutiny Bay, Whidbey). I think maybe 5 out there. couple males for sure. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

6:15 p.m. -
They are still one mile south of
Bush Pt
, 2 adult males, several adult non-males and several juveniles/calves. They have been breaking up into several small groups, circling around and re-joining each other, hunting/foraging behavior...unfortunately have to leave for a moment so hope others have found them! They are quite close to the Whidbey side.

5:45 p.m. - Orcas are now about one mile south of Bush Point
. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*
Claudia Mitchell called in a report of
6 - 8 orcas heading south passing Bush Pt. at
5:15 pm
.
*

Entry 6:
7:50 a.m - About a dozen orca foraging out front Active Pass, Georgia Strait
750am this morning. They were all angled west but spread out. Not making much ground. Saw from ferry.
*
Coastal killer whales -

Entry 7:
Pt Arena Peninsula Mendocino County Northern California
: At
1330 6 orcas
, 2 ahead of a tight group of four, at a heading of 170 degrees. Fast travel into the wind with lots of "porpoising" resulting in much white water. We are quite certain there are two males that appear to be traveling together in the group of four. They are approximately 2 miles offshore. At
1405 they were out of sight to the south
and into some gloomy weather. -Scott Mercer, Mendonoma Whale and Seal Study

March 15 - Possession Sound - Day two with the Sounders on the Chilkat Express! Conditions were amazing today and we met up with
Gray Whales #49 Patch and #53 Little Patch
again on our morning trip. We saw them again in the afternoon and also welcomed
#21 Shackleton
to Puget Sound for the first time this year! The whales on both trips were circling and milling around the
SE side of Gedney Island
, likely waiting for the tide to rise so they could feed in the shallow waters of the Snohomish River Delta. -Justine Buckmaster
*
1400: We just found #21
, just south of Gedney! Justine Buckmaster just confirmed ID. Welcome back Shackleton!
1105 - Patch and Little Patch
have split now. Patch still heading for Gedney while LP is circling.
1033 - #49 and #53 heading toward southeast corner of Gedney
. -Renee Beitzel, Chilkat Express

Entry 8:
Saratoga Passage -
12:17 p.m. - Gray whale
heading northwest.
Between Forbes Point and Polnell Point (Oak Harbor)
-Terra Parhman

two grays
, one slightly closer to shore more east, both appear eastbound.

10:44 a.m. -
there's
a gray whale eastbound in mid Crescent Harbor
headed in the direction of Polnell Pt. Maybe 1/2 mile offshore? -Rachel Haight
