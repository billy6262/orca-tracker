Orca Sightings for October 29, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Wandered down to the harbour here and saw
3 orcas: one adult female and two young orcas from
16:30 to
16:45 in the Sidney harbour
between the two large fishing piers. Saw three sequences; last sighting was
within 20m of shore
in front of a small beach right in town, with all three surfacing. Saw the tail fin out sideways so unsure if feeding or playing. Expected them back up and stayed till
17:30 but no luck. Seemed like Southern Resident dorsal fins but I'm out of practice - I had thought Residents traveled in larger groups, so wondering if these were transients. In close to shore too. No other marine mammals visible. -Cheers, Brian McHattie

GRAY WHALES -

Entry 3:
08:03 - Gray whale
heading east out of
Hammersley Inlet
, rounding Church Point. She's big and I got out just in time to see her breach! Sorry no time for photo.....More than half her body out of the water and then she flopped on her side. Plus (sorry I'm not sure of terminology) she showed her full 'tail' twice. -Carolyn Lockmom
