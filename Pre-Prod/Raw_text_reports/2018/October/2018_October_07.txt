Trip report - on our last scheduled whale watch trip for 2018, we set off under rainy skies through the San Juan Islands towards
Spieden Island
, where whales had been spotted! We found the
T49As
again, a family of 5 whales (mom and 4 kids) and had great views of them, between a few rain drops, but also enjoying beautifully calm seas. We left the whales trending
towards Waldron Island
, and we continued to Sucia Island to see Steller sea lions and harbor seals. Several bald eagles were spotted, and when almost back to port, lots of harbor porpoise. An ice-cream for all passengers rounded out the end of a wonderful 2018 season!! Thanks you Mystic Sea!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Oct 6 (into Oct 7) -
Transient calls lasted until a 1/2 hour after midnight
. Since the
T49As and the T65As
had been in the area and some of them had evidently split into different groups, going different directions (during daylight), I wonder if they were getting back together in the dark of night. And maybe it was someone else completely!

22:29 -
They are still in acoustic range...just heard them again.

20:23 faint T calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones
. -Jeanne Hyde

DALL'S PORPOISE, ELEPHANT SEALS, & BROWN PELICAN -
Oct 5-7 - Ahoy Orca Network, we are just back from a trip to the South Sound and had some great and rare sightings.
Over a dozen Dalls porpoise just north of Vashon I. and two Dalls porpoises off Robinson Pt
. Three separate elephant seal sightings including one near Elliot Bay and even a brown pelican in Commencement Bay. Thanks for all you do! More from Kevin Campion: Sadly no photos but 100% certain of the Dall's id. We saw a small group Friday the 5th at Robinson point and then over a dozen yesterday the 7th just north of Vashon. Loads of harbor porpoise as well on Sat. and Sunday south of Tacoma Narrows. We were surprised by the Dall's as well it has been since 2014 since I have seen any down in Puget Sound. Fall is always a cool time on the water! -Kevin Campion & crew, S/V Orion, Deep Green Wilderness
