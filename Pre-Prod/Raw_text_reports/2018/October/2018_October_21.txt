BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -
October in
Sooke

Humpback whales
everywhere and my favorites the
Transient Killer Whales (T11 & T11a)
our "Locals" were in Sooke Harbour but to our surprise we found them just off Secretary Island as we made our way home which brought many a smile to us.

Entry 3:
Rosario strait
, followed to Skyline Marina and out to Washington park when we lost them. Two adults and a juvenile. They played around with our dinghy for about 20 minutes. They came right to our boat. Sighting was
between 10 am and noon

These look like the

Entry 4:
Admiralty Inlet
- A call came in just after dark reporting a sighting of a single orca seen by Deborah Wright from the Coupeville ferry about noon today. The ferry veered to the left to avoid it. No direction given and no photos available.

Humpback whales

Entry 6:
two humpbacks off of Point No Point
yesterday at around
1pm
. They were breaching and slapping their tails for a while. They seemed to be following a fishing boat. I got this video from the beach on my cell phone. Not the greatest, but you can see their big splashes. -Kaitlyn Goodeve
*
Thanks to some eagle-eyed passengers on MV Saratoga, we were able to watch
Humpback Whale "Masquerade" (BCY0349) and a Minke Whale in Admiralty inlet
! Masquerade was southbound, heading back toward Possession....We left Masquerade near Mutiny Bay, closer to the Whidbey side, but she may have crossed over... I think it was around
10 am
. -Justine Buckmaster

UNIDENTIFIED WHALES -

Entry 7:
13:21 - 2 large
(blues) just spotted off
Point No Point
light house Hansville (Kitsap Peninsula) ...Have seen humpbacks out here. These were huge. Headed east. From spout to fin too far. Dark in color. Came out of water very far. Myrna has been here decades and these were different according to her too. -Dennis Sutton
(
Note: We and CRC have not seen or heard of blue whales in our inside waters, humpbacks were reported at different times through out the day -alb

Entry 8:
For sake of space, we will not include all the many brief reports posted to our Facebook page which record that this
humpback, presumed to be MMX0128
, spent the day traveling back and forth in
Dalco Passage
which has been the case all week. Some videos posted to our Facebook page show the whale today breaching on occasion. - alb

. West of Owen beach. Seems to be milling around. -Heidi Armstrong

Saw a
humpback
this afternoon looking out to
Dalco Passage from 5 Mile Drive (Point Defiance)
. So exciting, I have been here so many times looking for humpbacks, this is my first time seeing one. Wish he was closer...he was closer to Vashon. Made my day. -Tira Will

MINKE WHALES -

next to the Keystone ferry. -Christopher Spjut
*

Entry 12:
Minke Whale in Admiralty Inlet between Port Townsend and Keystone

Entry 13:
7:30
and heard the sound of air coming out of a blowhole about 200(?) yards off the old ferry dock in
Gig Harbor
. I managed to isolate the area as I kept hearing the air through the blowhole sound. I managed to get a few so-so shots of the animal and I was wondering if you could help me identify what type of dolphin (I assume it was a dolphin) it was. It was swimming alone. After about 5 minutes or so, it did not come back up anywhere near where I was watching. I have attached the photo(s) for you. -Thanks. Jeff Hurdus
(
That is almost certainly a
bottlenose dolphin
. I can't be as certain that it is Stump, because the trailing edge of the dorsal fin isn't clear enough. It is roughly the right shape for her dorsal, and she was in the South Sound last week, so there is a good chance that it is her. -Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research

PORPOISE -

Entry 14:
in the Hood Canal by Lilliwaup
. I got a closer look at them today and it looked like dolphins. Is that possible? Do you know if there are dolphins in the canal or who I should ask? Thank you! From what I recall the dorsal fin looks like the
harbor porpoise
photo. -Holly Stender
