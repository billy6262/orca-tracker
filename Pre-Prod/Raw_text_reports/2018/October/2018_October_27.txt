Sat Oct 27 - With the end of our field season just a few days away, we had what may likely be our last official research encounter of 2018 this evening off the north end of
Orcas Island
. It included two new groups to us - the
T35As and T38As - plus the T123s with a new calf
in tow. We'll share some end of season thoughts next week, but for now, a moment of Zen. (See OBI Facebook VIDEO)

, heading towards Rosario Strait

17:30 - These Ts (T35s, T38s, & T123s)
heading SE
between Orcas and Matia
. So thankful to have met the newest little munchkin on the block this evening -
T123D
, first seen earlier this month. Also check out the unique white pigmentation spot on the dorsal fin of T38A, another new whale for me. -Monika Wieland Shields

Standing on my deck. It (gray whale) was heading north out of

t. This is the second surface of a three surface surfacing series. Then a long dive. Next surface was way north, heading toward the southern tip of
Squaxin Islan
d. In the rain. Where I lost sight of it.

Entry 7:
two dolphins seen in the Hood Canal
today. Probably the same two that were spotted earlier this week. I don't know what kind, but I have seen them (this type) before. Dark color and large. Two seen at

9:15 am
Saturday, Oct. 27th about
two miles north of Lilliwaup
, heading north in the middle of the canal. Looked like they were traveling out at a pretty good speed. Sorry, no photos.
ON staff sent Jeni some info and photos for comparison:
Thank you for the photos! Very helpful. I'm thinking
bottlenose
because of the well defined, bigger fin and longer body. I have seen this type of dolphin in the canal before (like I saw Sat.). The pace they move at, fin and body size....Surely someone else saw them that day? I hope so, and that they can identify them! -Jeni Gray

Entry 8:
BCZ0155 Manta
goes on a dive....on Saratoga brought us back out to
Race Rocks
where we found a large gathering of
13+ Humpback Whales
and then hundreds of Sea Lions (both Steller and California). It was a bit choppy out, but overall a nice day. -Justine Buckmaster
