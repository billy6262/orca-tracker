Fri Oct 12 - North Puget Sound - on MV Saratoga...I didn't even work today, I rode along with family. We were so lucky! ...We saw
3 Humpbacks, part of the T65A pod, and Gray Whale #185
.
re:
humpback encounter; We were south of Possession Bank
, about half way between Edmonds and Kingston. It was for sure
Two Spot and Masquerade
, and while it's probably safe to assume the 3rd was Zephyr, he/she stayed a bit too far away to confirm ID.
Humpbacks CS631/CRC16017 Two Spot and BCY0349 Masquerade off Possession Bank
. Engines off while whales were curious or whatever it is they are up to when they interact with boats. -Justine Buckmaster

BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN -

Entry 9:
1:15-
1:30pm - Stump, one of the bottlenose dolphins from Coastal California, was hanging out by herself fishing just south of Sunnyside Beach in Steilacoom
. We were driving along Chamber's Creek Road toward University Place when we spotted her just off shore, and were able to pull into the parking lot of Sunnyside and enjoy watching her. She was surfacing a few times in a row and then flashing her tail as she did deeper dives. It was a beautiful day to enjoy this unusual visitor to the Puget Sound. -Belen Bilgic Schneider
(
ID confirmed by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research
)

dolphins. That was at
13:03
