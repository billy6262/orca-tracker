Orca Sightings for January 5, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Admiralty Inlet -
3:05 p.m.
- Spotted
a pod of Orca Whales
off the bow of the Kennewick Ferry
on the way from Coupeville to Port Townsend at about
3:05pm
on Friday. I'm really bad at estimating distance so I'll just say they were a ways off ahead of the boat. Hard to tell how many there were exactly but I saw at least three fins. They were traveling pretty close together and heading Southeast, towards the inner Puget Sound in between Whidbey and Marrowstone Island. Traveling, I think. 48.134, -122.710. My first sighting, yay! -Tyler Schexnayder

3:01 p.m. - Group of 4-5 orca heading south towards Marrowstone Point.
1500. Seen from ferry. -Frederick Earl Dowell

Entry 2:
2:16 p.m.
- I just saw an
orca
about half a mile
in front of the Mukilteo Ferry dock
, can't tell you much as I only saw it briefly before it dove, but I only saw one and I think headed south. -Melissa Simmons
