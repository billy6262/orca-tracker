Orca Sightings for January 15, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's/Transient killer whales -

Entry 2:
Admiralty Inlet - We saw them too from Ebey's Landing
on Whidbey! They had one baby with them. I couldn't see any markings. Too far away. It appeared to be
4-6
together....far away so pretty pixelated.

ID notes from 4 photos below, by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research: "
I think T100C is the male
. This could be the T100s and T90s again"

3:59 p.m. - Group of orcas just south of the Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry. Probably 7
