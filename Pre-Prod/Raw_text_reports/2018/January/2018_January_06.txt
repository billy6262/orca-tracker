...they are kind of spread out. But moving pretty fast. I grew up in the Midwest and have always been infatuated with Killer Whales. When I moved to Seattle 2.5 years ago all I could hope for was to see these amazing animals in the wild. I thought I was never going to get lucky enough to see something like I saw today. I cried. At least twice. This network of people made it possible. And to the people at Point Robinson that told me where to go, let me chase them along the beach & use their binoculars, I am forever grateful. So from the bottom of my heart, Thank you! -Jessica Eckler

Humpback whales -

Entry 4:
3:50 p.m.
- Just saw what looked like
a small baleen whale just north of the North Vashon ferry dock

*
My swim group at
Alki
spotted what we believe was
a humpback whale around
9:30am
this morning heading towards
Vashon
. The colors on the underbelly match a humpback as well as the fluke match what we saw. Would love to see if there are any other reports of humpbacks in the area to confirm if it was that or a gray!...The one we saw was smaller and we were shocked to see it so close to the Alki bathhouse, maybe only 150-200 yards away. It came up to the surface, went under again, gave us a beautiful display of the fluke, and spouted several times as it swam towards the Alki Point Lighthouse. -Melissa Kegler

3:50 p.m.
