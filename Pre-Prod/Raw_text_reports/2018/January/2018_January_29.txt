Orca Sightings for January 29, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
South Puget Sound - Approx

2:30 p.m. - Gig Harbor, 2 Orcas
came thru as we were on a boat moving slowly watching and listening to eagles. They both passed so close we watched as we were glared at, at least we thought so, as on the other side were seals. The Orcas pushed the seals inland, and once could not get them they turned around and waited, and after a few minutes swam right back past us waiting to see if the seals moved out from shore....Yes,
in the harbor
, there are a bunch of homes on the right side after you pass under the bridge, about 4 boats stopped and watched for about 35 minutes. Amazing experience! We took some pics, will place here. My wife thought she was going to be chum! -Timothy Edick
