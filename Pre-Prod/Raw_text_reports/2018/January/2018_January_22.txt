Orca Sightings for January 22, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Unidentified killer whales -

Entry 2:
as ferry was leaving Swartz Bay, Vancouver Island. They were just lolling about at the surface and forced 2 Gulf Island ferries to actually stop. One was slapping a pectoral on the water, there was a lot of splashing, and otherwise they swam in circles for about 10 minutes (feeding?)... there was much activity including short dives. 2 adults and a smaller one stayed quite close together. They moved over beside Knapp Isl when my outgoing ferry came through the narrow passage at Clive Island (they were by the red marker). Sighting was made from outgoing Gulf Islands ferry. -Frank Gee
