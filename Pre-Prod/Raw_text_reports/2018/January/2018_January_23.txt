Orca Sightings for January 23, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents -
4 Orcas by our shore at
2:30pm today- Mayne Island, Edith Point
. Nice orcas, including one breach...right in front of our home facing Georgia Straight on Mayne island, Edith Point. Close to shore. Seals were very scared. They were hugging the coast quite close (more than in recent years) and heading south towards Saturna and then US waters. One shot has clear markers. Are these transient or resident?

Entry 3:
2:15 p.m. - A whale was sighted between Manchester fuel depot and Bainbridge Island
heading west toward the fish pens. It had a lengthwise linear pattern on its underside. I saw it jump twice coming fully out of the water both times. I was very excited to see this. Any idea what the species is?.. After more discussion: The whale was not an orca or porpoise variety. It had striations on the underside and it breached fully out of the water on two occasions that I saw, one time after the other. The first time it was more broadside, the second time it came out of the water vertically. I don't think it was a gray whale, so
I'm guessing it was a humpback
. I can't tell you if it had a dorsal fin. It had fins on the sides, like arms. I don't have an estimate of length, but it did look big from my perspective. -Deborah Flynn

1:25 p.m. -
Sighted what I think was a minke off Prospect Point in Colvos heading north. Solitary, shiny black with smal dorsal....We see humpbacks fairly often, so I'm quite certain it wasn't one of them. It was very close to shore directly in front of our house or I would have assumed it was one. Flat water and not raining, so very visible. At one surface event, we (my wife and I) saw its head peek through the surface and I'd estimate the distance between head & dorsal to be 8-10, so probably too large to be a dolphin. -Clif Alferness
