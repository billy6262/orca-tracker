Orca Sightings for January 9, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Departure Bay -
03:15 PM
- Hi! I am very excited to report my first Orca sighting. I spotted a group of
5 or 6 heading right into Departure Bay
. As the bay is shallow and small, I awaited their return to open water. About 20 minutes later I watched them from Stephenson Point as they exited the bay and made their way north, close to the shore. I have some pics that aren't great but may help you to identify them. I hope so! One was very little. -Deidre Steward
