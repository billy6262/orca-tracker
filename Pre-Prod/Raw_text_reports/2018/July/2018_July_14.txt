Orca Sightings for July 14, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
This is my friend Pia Parrish sighting from
Lime Kiln Point
in San Juan Island on Saturday,
July 14 at

5:19 pm
. Pia was with her soccer team (60 and over category and mostly from San Diego) at Soccerfest 2018 held in Bellingham this year. This was the first time most of them had seen orcas and they had taken the islands bus to Lime Kiln, so it was great timing! They were thrilled to see the orcas! (Members of
J & K pods
went by. See Pia Parrish Facebook VIDEO). -Susie Nelson
