Entry 3:
Js went west. J46
was here on this visit but not with her family the J17s and the J16s on the west side on the morning of
July 15 as they went north. She has been spending a lot of time with J31 and J40, so it seems
she may have gone west with the rest of J and K Pods
today! It kind of warms and breaks my heart at the same time that these young females without their moms have banded together. And,
Onyx
went west presumably - at least not with the J16s/J17s. He seems to be with the J19s lately.
J44 Moby, J53 Kiki, and J17 Princess Angeline off Lime Kiln this morning. J16s and J17s north of Lime Kiln heading slowly north.

Entry 4:
- T34s, T37, T37Bs, and T73B -
Here are some pictures from two of our encounters with the group of 8 transients, including the T34s, T37, T37Bs, and T73B on
July 15 from MV Saratoga. There are a few pictures from the morning,
due south of Smith Island
, with T34 and T34B surfacing together, and T34 surfacing with part of a harbor seal in her mouth. The rest of the pictures are from later in the day (around
6:30) just
south of Possession Point
when this group caught something with very little effort - One minute they appeared to be cruising along slowly and possibly going to sleep then before you new it they were eating on something. There are a few pictures of T34 and T34B coming up in opposite directions while eating their meal, and a photograph of T73B and T37B1 swimming together. T37B1 (a young 6 year old boy) has been hanging out very close to big T73B on all four encounters we had with this transient pod on
July 14 and 15. Its pretty common to see a young male hanging close to an adult male like this. Maybe he's just trying to learn the ropes. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express.

6:00 p.m. - Just saw a group of
6-8 orcas from our boat near Mutiny Bay
. One very large male with giant wavy dorsal. First saw them near Bush Point on Whidbey side of shipping channel. We left them just south of Double bluff. The Amsterdam cruise ship came by and the orcas got really close. There were a couple of tail slaps. Seemed like they were still heading south but quite a bit of milling. This is my second time ever seeing them. I still have chills! -Logan Goheen

5:25 p.m. - 5 or 6 orcas, including 2 males, off Double Bluff
, SW Whidbey Island, heading SE toward Pt. No Point. -Danielle Pennington

T34s, T37, T37Bs, and T73B) at McArthur Bank
this afternoon, but they were trending toward Partridge Bank when we left. -Renee Beitzel

Strait of Juan de Fuca
a mile or 2 off the mouth of the Elwha. -Photo by James Gresham,
