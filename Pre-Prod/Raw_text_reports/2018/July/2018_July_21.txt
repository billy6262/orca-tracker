Southern Residents - We were first to find some of our

multiple humpback whales around Race Rocks Lighthouse

J53 Kiki! J17s were off Sooke

July 21 (
CA40, CA137 and T99s; split up in the afternoon
)
CA Transients: San Juan Island today, with local Ts!!
I identified "exotic" male
CA137
in the distance with Bigg's transients
T99s
, and his associate, female
CA40
: I often see them off California. Capt. Alan Niles (Maya's Legacy Whale Watching) and I were JUST talking about how cool it would be to see CA Ts - and it happened: fantastic! (CA Killer Whale Project). -Alisa Schulman Janiger

It was an interesting day here in the Salish Sea with multiple small groups of orcas around. One of them was the
J16s
, the only Southern Residents currently remaining in inland waters. Another was
a pair of California transient killer whales
, rare visitors to this area. And a third, pictured here, was the
T99s
(see photo below). We were lucky enough to encounter all three of those groups today! -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 4:
Humpback
whale not too far from port, and found a
small juvenile
traveling alone by the
shore of Cypress Island
. He surfaced often, but no tail fluke. He surprised us and came fairly close to the boat. His skin appeared to be somewhat shriveled, hope he's ok. Then we received word of
transient orca out by Hein Bank
- wow - these whales were ID'd as California whales,
CA137, CA40, and our "own local" Transient/Biggs included T99B
. First time for me to see any of these whales, what an amazing treat. Lots of shrieks from passengers as several of these whales "mugged" us. Amazing sight, exciting day. Oh we had seals, a few harbor porpoise and Bald Eagles also!!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Entry 7:
7:15pm to
8:15pm
last evening at the
southern tip of Rosario Strait
; approximately 10 minutes from the Anacortes Marina. We saw the same
pair of humpbacks
earlier in the afternoon a lot further out, almost near Lummi. At that time they were just cruising. On our way back to Anacortes, the captain got a call from his friend on a smaller boat about the pair closer to the marina so we sped there and were able to witness them do this for almost an hour before they finally left and continued their swim south. Other sightings included
2 transient Orca Pods
(the male and female from the California pod) and the 4 female tran-residents near Lopez. Will share pictures soon for those guys as well. -Rohan Kamath

...We left Anacortes hoping to see a
Humpback whale
not too far from port, and found a small juvenile traveling alone by the shore of
Cypress Island
. He surfaced often, but no tail fluke. He surprised us and came fairly close to the boat. His skin appeared to be somewhat shriveled, hope he's ok. ...Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist. (Images zoomed and cropped)

Entry 8:
3:08 p.m. - Two beautiful humpbacks
side-by-side just passed close to shore at
Eagle Cove
, currently off of Grandmas Cove with killer whales at salmon bank! Their exhales are SO powerful! Heading south close to shore! Very north end of South Beach now
3:12. -Lodie Gilbert Budwill
*

Entry 9:
3:26 p.m. - One humpback whale
northbound midchannel,
3 miles south of Bush Point
and the south end of Marrowstone Island. -Bart Rulon, Saratoga
*

Entry 10:
Humpback
? spotted midchannel heading south at sunset from
Bainbridge ferry
. Only saw the tail flukes at a distance of approx 150 meters as it drove and did not see it again...Maybe saw white, don't remember clearly. I was talking to someone and suddenly saw it out of the corner of my eye just as the tale flukes came up and then dove. Then it was maybe 30 seconds until the ferry passed the spot where there was a smooth spot and expanding ripple from the displaced water. It was obviously a large volume of water displaced, clearly a whale. It was right in the middle of the ferry lanes - between south and north lanes, just as the two ferries were passing in opposite directions. -Jordan Van Voast

Entry 11:
humpback in Samish Bay
this morning from

6:50 to at least
9:00AM
. It rolled & breached, and was swimming between the crab pots! Bob McGary was the first person on North Beach (Samish Island) to spot it. We watched it play near the North side of the point and swim out near the oil tankers. -Laura Wieger Kraig

July 21 - This is really a bizarre situation, we live in Skagit Co, on Samish 'Island' which is surrounded by three bays,
Alice, Padilla and Samish Bay
. This posting (Janet Cater's below) of a whale is very unusual, it looks like a gray whale (
is a
humpback
-alb
), have you had any other sightings of this whale in the vicinity of Vendovi, Lummi, Cypress Islands at this time? Our bay is very very shallow and not sure what brought this whale into our area, but very exciting for the person who posted it, noted below. Thanks for your advice! -Charlene Day
