============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (Most of J pod) -
A friend said they passed
Lime Kiln
heading north about 20 minutes ago, so
around
8:20.
J-Pod zipped past Lime Kiln in big seas afternoon, and this little youngster seemed to be enjoying the waves (pretty sure this is
J53 Kiki
). -Monika Wieland Shields

4:57 p.m - Most of Js were in lead group, J16s trailing
- all
south of Lime Kiln now. J51
was little whale in lead group I believe, but I did see J50 too. -Monika Wieland Shields

4:50 p.m. -
First small group is passed.. wondering if J50 was in that group? So many behaviors and questions. Hope what looked like fishing behavior, was prosperous.

I have a leader female here now... far for me to get photo. Porpoising almost through chop. Male wayout. (from Land Bank). -Cher Renke

The
humpback
started on the northeast shore of
Fox Island by Hope Bay and Zee's, at about
8:45pm

. -Cari Black

7:20 p.m. -
Just saw a
whale off of Northern Fox Island
heading from South to North. Not sure what kind but I think it went around the northern tip of Fox Island around the spit because I did not see it continue up Carr Inlet. -Lance Loyd
(Confirmed
humpback
from photos below - alb
)

5:48 p.m. -
I don't know if this is something you track, but I was just walking along the little
Salters Point Beach in Steilacoom
when a lone whale went by! I'm not sure if it was grey or humpback, but it was cool! Seemed maybe a little smaller compared to others I've seen. -Emily Di

Saw group of orcas headed south off
SE edge of Guemes Island
