At least a dozen humpback whales

Gray whales -

Entry 2:
6:00 a.m -
Good morning, had an opportunity to see the
gray whale
just now. Moving very slowly towards the shallows north of
Jetty Island
from mid channel. -Photo by Lori Christopher,

Entry 3:
Coal Docks (BC coast)
, but well worth it as Mystic Sea encountered
two, possibly 3 groups of Transient/Biggs orca
in the area. They appeared to be mixed together in a couple of groups (
T124As and T36As
for sure,
possibly T49As
also), with many directional changes. What a thrill to see these mammal eaters, wild and free, and on such a beautiful day. A few harbor porpoise were spotted, harbor seals, and eagles, with Mt. Baker looming in the background as we returned to port. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

AS30 pod near Seldovia in Kachemak Bay, Alaska
. They were fairly active with spyhops and cartwheels. -Emma Luck

Entry 6:
~
8:30 p.m.
- I live in a magical place. We saw this whale, I think a humpback (confirmed humpback - alb), breaching in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
aka the Puget Sound aka the Salish Sea, on the ferry ride back to the USA, from Victoria BC, on Sunday evening. How majestic is Mt Baker in the background?! Mid channel but
closer to Port Angeles than Victoria
. See Facebook Video. -Desha Wood
