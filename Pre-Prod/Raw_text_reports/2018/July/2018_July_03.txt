Thanks a lot for your message. meanwhile, a new passage today, very beautiful in
Active Pass
. They went slowly with lots of turning around and splitting in 2 groups. The pod was either 5 or 6 strong. I assume they are also transients. Photos show the
T36As and T99s

Watched
PCFG 185
come very close to shore, circle back around and head right for the

I found the whale to the west under stil off
Harborview park
as viewed from Howarth park....Is a
gray whale
feeding, or trying to. Seeing from distance but whale is moving around just fine engaged in typical feeding behavior inshore. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Still there. Maybe seeing 2 animals? Frequent sighting but too far away to ID.

8:34 a.m -
I'm seeing the blows near pilings just off
Harborview park
in Everett. Not usually in that area. -Mary Dunlan

7:27 a.m -
[confirmed as
gray whale PCFG 185
) Way to close to shore/sea wall/ old wooden pilings for my comfort. Viewed for a brief moment on the Sounder Train between Everett and Seattle. Viewed between
Pigeon Creek Beach and Howarth Park
. Feeding and or in distress...Thanks for the quick phone call. To confirm it was definitely side-tail thrashing before a shallow dive, then the hump, then the spout. It was fairly light gray in color, though it was in the shade still and again only got a quick glimpse for a few seconds while on the train. Please let me know. I guess it's best if you don't find anything, in this case. But in the rare case that it did need help I needed to let someone know. -Ryan Ottaway Martin
