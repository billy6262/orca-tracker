Orca Sightings for July 7, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient orcas up to Canada by N.Pender Island
, and caught up with them after a beautiful trip through Pole Pass and Spieden Island. This was the
T124A family
, a matriarch born in in 1984, and three of her calves. They were close in-shore, heading south. At Bedwell Harbor, they attempted to catch a seal, but the seal hauled out on some rocks and escaped! They then continued their travels south and we also headed southeast home. We saw a few bald eagles and some fat harbor seals with pups on Ripple Island. With quite a few international passengers on board, it was a great trip on the beautiful Salish Sea. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Coastal killer whales -

Entry 2:
7:00 p.m. - Killer Whales off Coos Bay, Oregon
. Tucker and I were walking the beach last night and saw killer whales! I was so excited to see them! I was able to see
6 whales
, including one male. Unfortunately they were too far offshore for me to be able to get any kind of identification photos. However, they were spread out and exhibiting foraging behavior. One breach. I know there were reports of salmon in the area yesterday. Watched them forage for almost two hours. -Elizabeth Seely
