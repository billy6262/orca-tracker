Orca Sightings for July 29, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J50 Scarlet
, born
December 2014, here swimming in Haro Strait, off the west side of San Juan Island, along with her family and
all of J pod & L87
. J50's prognosis is not good, she is emaciated and shows no sign of improving. All of us are holding this little girl in our hearts with hope. An unusual photo of the day call to action in these unusually difficult times. Along with others, Monika encourages us all to take action and let our voices be heard on behalf of J50, J35 and her deceased baby girl, and all of the Endangered Southern Residents: -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

July 29th update from San Juan Island: it has been an emotional week up here. As of this morning, we heard
J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter for now going on 6 days
. Some other
J-Pod
whales did come in last night as well and we saw the
J16s (from shore) off Land Bank
this morning, including J50 Scarlet who is pictured here. We refuse to let J35's vigil be in vain, so please join us in participating in the governor's task force process in whatever way you can, starting by attending the meetings
August 7 in Wenatchee and
August 28 in Anacortes. The public must be engaged in this process to ensure serious action is taken, and not just a few token feel-good efforts that will not substantially help the Southern Residents. It was a day full of many magical moments. Here's one of them. (Lime Kiln Point State Park,
July 29th, with
all of J-Pod
). -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

2:25 p.m -
Listening to the
Limekiln hydrophone on my computer, hearing orca (S1?) calls
. I open up a live webcam (Desticam) showing Lime Kiln live. I caught a
glimpse of an orca
surfacing at the top of the view, maybe 150-200 yards offshore. Less than a minute later, a fishing vessel charges by just off the rocks, maybe less than 50 yards out. Very very loud. Poor orcas. No more calls heard. If Desticam records, you can catch it at about
2:25pm or so, 7/29/18. -Deb Frost

What a heartwarming day, seeing some normalcy amongst
J-pod members, and L87 Onyx
, who were mixed in with the J17s...So thankful (and yes, J35 is still pushing/carrying her deceased calf, day 6 now.

Hi there, Orca sighting
Jervis Inlet
. Reporting
4 orcas
seen swimming within ~100m of the shoreline of the west side of
Hardy Island
. They were swimming from north to south. They would make circles occasionally, either playing or feeding, though no bait/prey was observed. Last time I saw orcas in the area was over 5 years ago, although I don't frequent this area often myself! Please see pics for whale markings. I have more photos, not sure what exactly is needed for ID. Would like to know if you are able to identify them, and any info. -Thank you, Laura Bekar

Dolphins -

Entry 8:
~
3:00p.m.
- Can you identify this
dolphin
we saw today in
Budd Inlet
? (
Confirmed
Common dolphin
, see photo - alb
) Maybe a little SW of Gull Harbor in Budd Inlet. A few hundred yards off eastern shore...They were super friendly and wanted to play. My husband was swimming in the water before they showed up and they almost came right up to him. There were 3 of them and they stayed in the same area for almost an hour just circling the boat. One of the Common dolphins who remain in Puget Sound, primarily in the southern portion, seen here in Budd Inler. A large number of Common dolpins in 2 groups arrived in 2016, most left, but a small number remain. -Shelia Faker
