Hi ON, We had the opportunity to see
members from K pod
off the
west side of San Juan Island
7/13/18. At first it was difficult finding orcas - the J's seemed to have headed westbound and the K's were spread far and wide. At around

3:30pm the orcas
came closer together and began to breach all around - especially K25 and K34. (see photos below) What an amazing sight to see two male orcas leaping out of the water multiple times! We also saw a minke whale near Salmon Bank. -Cheers, Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

2:18 p.m -
I only saw
5-6 from LK
. More were presumably offshore. It was the
K13s
that just passed Lime Kiln (southbound)

1:43 p.m. -
Some orcas approaching much closer to shore and no boats with them. From
Lime Kiln
.

K12s
off south beach. Other than that only firm IDs of first group I've heard is
J16s and J19s (and L87). K27! Off Lime Kiln Lighthouse this afternoon
. -Monika Wieland Shields

11:49 a.m. -
I think trailers just passed
Lime Kiln
, still down island but some mid channel. We probably saw about a dozen but there were certainly more mid channel that I didn't see.

n now, porpoising. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

calls and echolocation
continued.

11:32 a.m -
tuned back in to
Lime Kiln hydrophone...Js vocalizing
including S4s and a lot of echolocation. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*
I believe we just had some of the
J's
go by - heading west through
Boundary Pass. Probably 12 whales
total but hard to say as they were all spread out. Lots of breeches, tail slaps, and other surface behaviours. Pretty special way to spend my last morning out here. We are at the southern tip of South Pender near Tilly Point. We saw them at
about
8:30 a.m.
They did look like they were heading towards Turn Point on Stuart Island. -Madison Duffin
