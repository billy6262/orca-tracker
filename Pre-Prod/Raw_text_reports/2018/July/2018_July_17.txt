Orca Sightings for July 17, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
When we heard there were whales on the west side tonight and headed out to see them, we assumed we would find the
J16s and J17s
who had been doing the westside shuffle all day. When we got to
Land Bank
, however, we were surprised instead to see the
K12s and K13s
, with many more blows offshore! There were some big seas out there today and apparently some more of our residents snuck back in! Here's
K37 Rainshadow
. -Monika Wieland Shields

7:57 p.m. -
Very spread but a lot of whales here - at least 4 males...Def
K12s and K13s
.

7:39 p.m. - Pretty sure some Ks
here

7:28 p.m. -
Not sure, but male I have here doesn't look like J26 - did others maybe sneak back in?

7:16 p.m. - Some off Land Bank
going north now. -Monika Wieland Shields

Saw a group of
4-5 orcas this morning going South around
10:30 AM off of the West Side Preserve on SJI
. 1 male, 2-3 females/sub-adults and 1 juvenile. We caught up with them again at American Camp by Granny's Cove around

11:30 AM
until they left us to go back North around

1:15 PM.
...I just looked through my photos and they appear to be the J-16s! All 5 were present! -Mellanie Rullman
*
It looks like the
J16s
were seen going north at
Lime Kiln
this morning around

9:30ish
but then turned back south. They were spotted at
Land Bank after 10 am
and presumably are still going south. This was relayed by a friend who was there. -Julie Woodruff

Entry 2:
orcas
, not sure residents or transient, on the Victoria clipper. Towards Victoria they we're a spread out pod around

9:45am
. Northbound. Only came up like 2 at a time possible baby with Mama! -Nikky Benn

whale now in the middle of
Case Inlet
.

7:43 p.m -
Just spotted solo Whale slapping it's tail and spouting east side of
Harstine Island
heading into case inlet. Possibly
humpback
. -Tina Davis

It was

3:50pm
when they were near the
Fox Island
fishing Pier. Tuesday,
July 17th...late afternoon we saw
2 whales
heading south past the east side of Fox island. The neighbors thought they were
humpbacks
. They didn't surface much (like the orcas we saw a last month) but we did see a tale flip when one surfaced the last time we saw it. So cool! We were surprised how close they were to a larger boat going by. -Pattie LaRue Warr
