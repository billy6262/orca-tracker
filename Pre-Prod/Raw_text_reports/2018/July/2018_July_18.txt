Orca Sightings for July 18, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:34 p.m - Lots of calls now over Lime Kiln
...I began to wonder if more whales...but I am hearing Onyx's distinct call!

10:16 p.m. - Some J Pod whales and L87 were on Lime Kiln hydrophones
and Orca Sound hydrophones about 10 minutes ago. The calls sounded as if they were overlapping calls, meaning the same calls being picked up by the two different HP locations, as there are a couple places where that will occur. A ship drowned out their sounds. These are the SRKWs who have been down island all day today. Not sure if they will be heard again tonight. -Jeanne Hyde

Southern Residents on the Lime Kiln hydrophones now,
22:38
. It sounds like a few members of J-Pod stayed south today and were seen near Lime Kiln at sunset! -Monika Wieland Shields

7/18 Trip Report: A lovely, cool summer day....and we headed up toward San Juan Island with reports of Resident (fish-eating) orcas off the west side. We caught a good look at some harbor seals at Dead Man's Island, and a juvenile bald eagle, then joined
big males J27 Blackberry and L87 Onyx leisurely fishing a few miles into Haro Strait, off False Bay
. They were circling, zig zagging, sometimes just hanging right below the surface. It was a beautiful time with these two magnificent guys. We left them as the wind came up, and checked out a wounded Steller sea lion on Whale Rocks. After a nice look at a mature bald eagle in his/her huge nest, we headed home.

Sounds like
J-Pod
continued north, but per AIS there are boats near
Eagle Point at

. We're wondering if K-Pod stayed in too!

July 18 - We had our 20th transient killer whale encounter of the season tonight when we met up with the
T46s east of Patos Island
while out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. This is 15 year old male
T46E
under Mt. Baker - he's already got a very impressive dorsal fin! -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Entry 2:
Eastern Juan de Fuca Strait - Transient orca pod
sighting. N48 07'30" ; W122 55'12" (southeast Protection Island) In addition to the attached photo, I have more images of the same adult male, including one in which the male has a harbor seal in its mouth. We observed 6 animals, although there may have been 1-2 additional orcas not visible because of early morning fog. We saw at least 2-3 adult females and a juvenile in addition to the adult male. -Peter Hodum

presumably
T73B was still w/ T34s, T37, & T37Bs

Seas have been a little nautical the last couple days but that does not stop the fun! Many
humpback whales
are still actively feeding in our area (mostly around
Race Rocks to Constance Bank
last few days) and the weather looks great for the up coming weeks ahead! (including
CRC-15970/MMZ0004 and BCXUnk Tulip/HW-MN0510009
). -Paul Pudwell

Entry 4:
8:45 p.m
. Annette and I spotted a blow in the middle of the channel
between us and Whidbey Island just north of Paregos Lake
. There were a series of splashes and some laconic slow rotations with the long fin exposed in the air, almost like a sailboard in the wind. Annette saw the tail for a moment but was unable to tell if it was at the end of a breach or a tail slap. The distance was way too great for the camera but I made an image anyway; make of it what you please. We believe it may have been a
humpback
, given the length of the pectoral fins. An approaching tugboat and tow disturbed the event, but after the traffic passed, it took up again and moved slowly north out of sight in the dwindling twilight. It is striking how long the fin is in comparison the the tug even though the tug is further away. Thanks for all your good work. Proof of presence: pec fin of
humpback in Admiralty Inlet
. -Sebastian Eggert and Annette Huenke

Entry 5:
18:35 - two humpbacks
heading west
along Waldron's north shore, near Skipjack
at the moment. -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 6:
2:45 p.m. - (humpback) heading north from Budd Inlet
, passing in front of Boston Harbor Marina, angling west to the western shore of
Eld Inlet toward Hunter Point
. Last seen at
southern end of Squaxin Island
heading south east. -Kim Merriman

1:08 p.m. - humpback
was videoed from the
Riv marina
a bit ago, posted on the Anderson island community group. -Belen Schneider

~
10:15 a.m. - We saw it (humpback) just off Herron Point in Lakebay (Case Inlet
). -Bambi Lunn Fegley
*
Just now (
0900
) whale heading north
past Grapeview towards Allyn in Pickering Passage
...possibly gray whale or Minke (confirmed
humpback
- alb) ...just saw a bit of the back and the tail as it dove 3 times....My neighbor said it was hanging around all day. I was not fast enough this morning to get a photograph, but I did get a good look at its tail..there is either a deep gash or a big white scar on its right fluke and a couple of smaller ones alongside the big one. My drawing is not to scale, but the scars or cuts were quite visible. -Cammy Malm LaRiviere
