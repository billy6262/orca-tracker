Orca Sightings for July 1, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a good passage of a pod of
5 orcas
, I believe (one photo of batch 2 shows all 5) yesterday
July 1, at
115 to 145pm
. A few hundred meters off
Edith Point on Mayne island
in the Strait of Georgia. They were very active, with much jumping, splashing and other activities.

Entry 2:
(
IDs by Michael Colahan
)
*
We covered one hundred nautical miles of open water today on Pelagic with Deer Harbor Charters. Two tours that lasted four hours each. We saw three pods of Transient orcas today, small family groups of four or five that consist of a mother and her offspring. We saw one
humpback whale
that dove deep as we watched it from afar and several minutes later as we looked all around, it surfaced right next to the boat and surprised us all. The ships log has the bullet points of when and where. We went north and all the way around
North Pender Island
and saw the (reported as: T-137's but was the
37As
-
*
see Colahan IDs below) We went out to Boiling Reef off East Point of Saturna Island and saw the
T-36a's and T-49a's
doing some porpoising as well as backwards resurfacing around prey. As we returned we went past Sucia Island and saw the humpback whale that decided to surface and exhale right next to us and startle everybody. Sometimes it seems they are as curious about us as we are of them. It was a clear day with some clouds that progressed from low and puffy to high and wispy around the islands, but the Olympics and the Cascades on the horizons were shrouded in clouds. The currents and the wind cast a predictable spray and it made it even more of an adventure for the guests. Both trips went very well and I think all of the guests gained a deeper understanding of nature that they are taking home with them. Mission accomplished this day. -Alex Callen

Entry 3:
5:32 p.m. -
Directly across from
Whale Bell Park in Langley
. Watching through the telescope. Close to Camano side. Trending north, but most appear to be milling. -Dori Dace
*

5:10 p.m. - orcas now across near Pebble Beac
h stalled out for now.

5:00 p.m. - the 3 orcas
that I saw closer to
Sandy Pt
have now headed out mid channel directly
north of Langley
Seawall Park; looking as though they are heading towards Camano where there are 2 whale watching boats with the others.

4:40 p.m -
I see the
orcas are near Sandy Point
, Whidbey Island... coming north up Saratoga Passage. Spread out, some veering towards Camano, some near Sandy Point, at least close to Whidbey side. -Marilyn Armbruster

4:30-
5:00 at Pebble Beach
(Camano Isl), three orcas were feeding together, circling close together, breaching and slapping. We think they were feeding on small prey, and are wondering if they were residents? Otherwise, there has been young seals in the area. -Peg Boley

Sandy Point just after 4pm

. -Chris Boucher

Glendale Beach, Whidbey Island T124A's
...and in some cases so close to shore...I did not expect this at all, had no idea if I would even see them as it was misty rainy and last update/report they were near
Possession Point
. I thought I would just take Kai and go to Glendale beach and hang out just in case...-Marilyn Armburster
*
So this
morning
was kind of crazy. Like crazy-crazy. Long story short, Dori and I ran down to
Glendale Beach
this morning and met up with our good friend, Marilyn, who had arrived just minutes before us. Literally seconds from getting out of the car, we had the experience of a lifetime when the
T124A's
came in about 10 feet from shore. The pictures speak for themselves. -Durand Dace

Today, I was in a small boat, with my friend, Tara, and we witnessed the
orcas dang near become land mammals in Clinton
! Durand Dace is in this image. -Photo by Cara Hefflinger,
