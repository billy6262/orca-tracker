Orca Sightings for July 30, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mon Jul 30 - Trip Report: We motored out into Rosario Strait in choppy seas, and headed south with a report of some Bigg's (Transient, - meat-eating) Orcas off Victoria. First stop was at Colville Island to view the harbor seals and an eagle, then onward to meet up with the
family group of T18
(female born est. 1974),
T19 (female, born est. 1969), T19B (male born 1995) and T19C (male born 2001)
. They were right in
Oak Bay
, playing among the kelp beds. They then headed north toward the Chatham Islands and Discovery Bay. After watching them cruise these lovely small islands, we made our way back to Lopez Island through calmer seas, and saw more harbor seals and eagles. Another beautiful summer day on the Salish Sea. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Entry 2:

20:00 - Orcas Watts Point
(across from the mining museum for periods and then moved closer to
Squamish
at times)...we were out there for prob 45 mins viewing them along with about 1-4 other boats at different times. At first we spotted them heading South, for about 20 mins I'd say, with one very large whale on the far left (East) of us and the rest of the pod on the far right (West) of us. It was so interesting!! Why do they do that? After about 20 more mins of slow travel they switched directions and started heading North/back toward Squamish again. Right before we left to head into Squamish they started heading South again. T46 in Howe Sound. T46s and possibly the T137s. (See article The Squamish Chief w/video). -Vanessa Doak
