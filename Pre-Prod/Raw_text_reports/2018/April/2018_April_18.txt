on the Camano shore. Seem to be making their way towards Langley. -Ferris Dudunake
*

2:35 p.m. - #531 was the Baby Island
whale. She moved along the bluffs of Baby Island Hts westbound then turned left into Holmes Harbor and started feeding just south of Baby Island. She rolled around and fed for about 20 minutes then headed back north. She exited the Harbor, went a bit north then turned and she is now
mid way between Baby Island and the old Orca Network headquarters off North Bluff Road
, still well south of Hidden Beach community. Just before heading off island I was graced with some more time watching 531 roll around feasting on shrimp. She tucked into Holmes Harbor and fed for a short time just south of Baby Island. A touching beautiful sunny warm Wednesday moment with a big whale.

1:35 p.m. - Two grays:
One gray at
entrance to Holmes Harbor
westbound near Green buoy off Baby Island close in AND 2nd gray about
1-2 miles north of Baby Island
NE bound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Entry 5:
3 of our Sounders in Saratoga Passage
.
Gray whales 21, 22, and 383
were traveling closely together at a slow pace close to Langley when all of a sudden they picked up the speed and started some aggressive behavior towards each other at the surface.
383 breached 3 times
in a row and the whales started peduncle throws towards each other as they continued southward to Hat Island. This went on for about 20 minutes and then all 3 whales calmed down and things went back to normal. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Chilkat Express

Entry 7:
Hama Hama
. Elk in the meadow of the Hama Hama river and eagles on the way up, but no Orcas. ... On the way back at one stop looking from the North to the South I saw
a nice blow....It could have been a gray
, as the spout was fairly high & strong. However, I wanted it to be an Orca. Watched that area for awhile, but didn't see anything else. -Harry Louch
