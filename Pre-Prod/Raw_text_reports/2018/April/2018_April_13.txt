Entry 3:
gray whales
many times from a boat and at a distance from shore, but I've never seen a gray whale feeding off Whidbey within 100 yards of the beach FROM the shore.
Sounder #21 (Shackleton) spent a couple of hours meandering between Whale Bell park and the Dog and Boy park, Langley
in his quest for food, digging down deep into the sand for that "oh-so-tasty" ghost-shrimp. It certainly heralded well for tomorrow's Welcome the Whales event in Langley, and was a fascinating insight into how these whales have perfected this high risk strategy of feeding in shallow water. -Sandra Pollard
