Orca Sightings for April 3, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - ..on our first trip we were able to spend precious time with
J-pod
and it made me smile to find that
J46 "Star" and J40 "Suttles"
were together again (or perhaps still together) since the last time I had seen them. This time the two were swimming closely with
J31 "Tsuchi"
and her older brother,
J27 "Blackberry"

Entry 2:
T037A's and T099's
had one thing on their minds today.....FOOD! They spent almost all day making life very hard on the harbour seal population in Saanich Inlet. Here is
T099D
tearing some harbour seal apart while one of the
T37A, T99, T99D, T99C, T037A
kids helps from below the surface. -Gary Sutton

I went whale watching with Outer Island Adventures where we found the
T2Cs north of Victoria
. I believe they were northbound. I think we were with them from about

2:30-
3:15
or something like that. I heard that J pod was out yesterday as well but unfortunately we did not get to see them. -Connor O'Brien

Entry 3:
5 or so Orca near Hein Bank at 1748
. Just milling, looking to be foraging. -James Greenway
*

Entry 4:
5:05 p.m.
- seeing blows off far end of Woodland Beach,
possible gray
. Can't get direction yet, but will continue to observe from our high bluff lookout above
North Woodland Beach (Camano approx 4.5 miles north of Cama SP)
. -Krista Paulino
*
We watched
2 grays and a young one in Saratoga Passage from 10 am until
12:30 pm from the south end of Camano Island state park
. They traveled south on the Whidbey island side straight across from us, followed at a good distance by a large whale boat. After feeding near the shore they reversed direction and traveled north past Baby Island and Sandy Shores. They were last seen heading north, still along the Whidbey side. -Gail Dunbar

Tuesday
April 3rd, had the pleasure of watching
two gray whales swimming & feeding leisurely in Saratoga Passage, north of Camano State Park
between our home & Baby Island from

11:30am to
12:10pm
. They would split up to feed & rejoin intermittently, one whale swimming in circles & smacking water with its fluke. This caused excited barking from the seals on Baby Island. -Lisa & Scott Pate
*
At about

12:30
we spotted what I think was
3 grey whales across the strait from Camano State Park
, close to Whidbey Island. Lots of blows and tails, way too far from us to get any identifying photos. They lingered there for awhile then headed north. -Jeanette Lynn

Deceased gray whale
April 3 initial report:
We at Orca Network/Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network received a report on
April 3rd of a deceased gray whale on a Whidbey Island beach. A team of our Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network (CPSMMSN) volunteers conducted an initial examination that day and a full necropsy was conducted by Cascadia Research Collective and a team today
April 5th. It is a common and sad occurrence to have several gray whales die in our region during their migration north, as they head back to their feeding grounds after a long journey south to mating and breeding lagoons.
If you see this Whale on the beach, please keep your distance, and remember it is a federal crime to collect any marine mammal parts without a permit from NOAA Fisheries. Researchers can learn a lot from stranded whales and other marine mammals, and we ask the public to leave the whale alone in her final resting place. Cascadia has provided an intial update from todays exam (below), we will provide updates as more information becomes available. To report stranded marine mammals in Island, Skagit or N Snohomish counties, contact the CPSMMSN/Orca Network at 1-866-ORCANET or info@orcanetwork.org

April 5th update by Cascadia Research:
A young female gray whale that was first reported dead on the west side of Whidbey Island on Tuesday 3
April 2018 was examined today (5 April) by a team that included responders from Cascadia Research, SR3, Central Puget Sound Stranding Network, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The whale was just under 30 feet long and determined to be emaciated and the poor nutritional condition was likely a principal factor in its death. The thorough examination did not reveal any indications of trauma from ship strike or signs of entanglement but a wide range of tissues were collected for examination for pathology, disease, biotoxins, and contaminants. The unique markings on this whale did not match any of the more regular individuals that are typically seen in this region and cataloged by Cascadia Research and was likely one of the more than 20,000 gray whales that migrate past Washington each year in spring. The primary period for strandings of gray whales is April, May, and June so we are still early in this period.
A life too short...
