I'm forwarding this orca report (Orcas spotted in
Saltair
: "I see the
T37As
in the link photos, Melisa Pinnow, CWR). which was sent to me by my mother's neighbor, Brenda. The whales were visible from Mum and Brenda's condos, which overlook
Transfer Beach in Ladysmith, near Saltair
, which is between Nanaimo and Victoria B.C. on Vancouver Island. Mum didn't actually see them as we were on a Skype call at the time i.e. Monday,
April 2 at

10:00 am
. Brenda (Bailey) sent another pic which I'll forward - she found it on another Facebook site and did not take it herself. (we forwarded that photo to Melisa Pinnow, CWR :"The male looks like
T49A1 maybe
.") -Cheers, Sandra Pollard

Entry 2:
5:15 pm - Ts on Lime Kiln HPs
right now...just a few calls and they were of good volume. -Jeanne Hyde
*
Coastal killer whales -

Entry 3:
Orcas in Oregon off the Yaquina Head Lighthouse in Newport, OR
.
At least 7 or 8
(that showed up in my pictures simultaneously - most likely several more. One (maybe two) of the orcas circled a Gray Whale for several minutes but did not appear to attack it. The rest of the pod had moved South by then. -Pike Bremer
(
ID notes Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research: "Those are
Ts
but not sure who."

SEVEN whales today
!! No April Fool's joke either! Just after leaving port on calm seas, we found
#383 and #531
feeding together between Hat/Gedney Island and Sandy Point on Whidbey. Then
#21 Shackleton and #22 Earhart
were spotted together just east of Camano Head. Capt Eric then spotted another "blow" and we had quick views of the "new" visitor in town,
CRC 185
, before continuing to SE Hat/Gedney Island where we found
#49 Patch
feeding along the shallow bank, and we also found
#53 Little Patch
a little further west. What a thrill for our passengers - and our crew - to see so many gray whales in such a small area of Possession Sound! Well done, Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
