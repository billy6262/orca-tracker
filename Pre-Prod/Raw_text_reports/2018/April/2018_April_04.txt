Entry 4:
Two orcas at Hidden Beach
, Greenbank (east Whidbey Island) at
8 am
. There were some tall thin fins like the orca. I am attaching a distant photo, enlarged, the head looks like an orca. They seemed to be headed south. -Sanford Laguna
(
Reported as orca. Grays were reported in same area at same time, either is possible as orcas were confirmed next day 5th in Saratoga & Penn Cove, see above - alb

One
gray whale north of Hidden Beach, Saratoga Passage @

4:30-630pm
. The weather was gloomy and raining so this was the best we could do. We walked a total of 4 miles to see him/her. -Beth Clifton

2:30 p.m. -
Spouts just
south of the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry
, closer to Whidbey. Grays? -Le Anne Tobin
*

2:25 p.m. -
on a late Kittitas ferry we had a cetacean moving north to south across ferry lanes. No fin like a humpback so
presumably gray
BUT did some sort of tail throw while traveling. Lots of oohs and aahs in my carpool lol. Fluked up and stayed down and we are past now. Not every day you see these guys being that active. -Debbie stewart

8:00 a.m -
We received a report from Mary Pacher of Greenbank that she observed
two gray whales feeding at Hidden Beach at 8 am
