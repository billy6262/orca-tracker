I heard intermittent whale song. There was a ship in the area so it was difficult to hear with great clarity but it was clear enough to identify at least 2 distinct voices. During that time I checked the Lime Kiln lighthouse webcam and saw 1 surface and blow. -Patrick Heys (forwarded by Scott Viers, Orca Sound)

Entry 5:
9:45 a.m. -
I spotted a pair of orcas while out paddling this am. They were pretty far away but could have been quite large, dorsal fins were both tall, about equal in height and always surfacing in time together. They were heading South in the mid to
east-side Carr Inlet just northwest of Raft Island
. I saw them surface several times again west of Cutts Island before they were out of sight. Not sure if this is the proper way to report, but if you could let me know, great! We live on the water facing West to Carr and have seen a pair there before. -Melissa Ayn Pratt Meyer
