Entry 5:
7:58 p.m. -
Hey I'm curious is there
a humpback whale
hanging around by the
Clinton/Muk Ferry
? I just saw what appeared to be a humpback but could have been a gray too. It was just off the Clinton Ferry terminal but it dove before I could get a direction. The mate and I both thought we saw a hump on it's back but I haven't heard of any humpbacks in the area, but we only saw it breach a little bit and then dive so it could have just been the angle and the water. The back of the whale looked pretty dark and smooth, usually grays spout water and this one wasn't and wasn't very active. (
gray or humpback
