9:55 a.m - Orca off Apple Tree point southbound fast at
9:45
. At least 4 (really little one with them), didn't see a male I don't think. Should be crossing the ferry line about now. Four came by in close with one in front maybe 30 yards, then pair, then one behind. Pretty sure no male. Then maybe a minute or two later I captured the pair further out in the channel. They were a ways out further which is why I don't think it was the same pair...
