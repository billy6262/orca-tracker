Sunday afternoon

1:30 p.m. - gray whale feeding between Polnell Shores and Mariners Cove
. He/she was about a half mile east of yesterday's feeding. It must be a different depth because it was snorkeling most of the time. -Terra Parham (see photos and ID notes below)

Markings on the left side of the face are a match to the whale photographed by Mary Jo Adams on
April 9th, which matches the Unknown gray on the 27th and 28th below. ID notes by Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

Entry 7:
Sounders #44 (Dubknuck) and #53 (Little Patch)
greeted us south of
Hat Island
, followed by
#21 (Shackleton) and #22 (Earhart)
a little further north towards Port Susan. #44 and #53 were traveling together, as were #21 and #22, although later #44 appeared to have split off from #53.
#49 (Patch)
also made a brief appearance, keeping everyone guessing with a few rapid directional changes. This was our penultimate whale watch trip of the season in Langley before Mystic Sea returns to Anacortes. We wish the Sounders safe travels on their continuing migration north to their summer feeding grounds in the Bering Sea, and look forward to welcoming them back again next year. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

We were on the Victoria Clipper (out of Friday Harbor)... saw
4 gray whales
, just stopping to see the

ones, some
Minkes
but no orcas....(see Minke section). -Lisa Egashira Archide

Entry 8:
Gray whale leaving Hammersley
...around Libbey Point at

7:45 pm
4/29/2018. In re photos: One adult family member was outside as the whale passed in front of our house and just happened to see a nice healthy blow from what he described as
a small gray whale
. He alerted the rest of the us and we all saw a another blow right before the turn out of our view. We did drive up to Harstine Bridge to watch until darkness but didn't see anything. -Jodi Johnson Pardi
*

4:45 p.m - Grey at Hungerford Point/Pickering
. Headed south, center of Pickering. Looked like it might turn up Hammersley. -Chad Queirolo

Entry 9:
Minkes
.... we had left Friday Harbor, before we entered into Admiralty Inlet,
N. of Port Townsend
...I think. Captain saw
about 3-4
as we were coming home, stopped to see only 1 due to time constraints. -Lisa Egashira Archide
