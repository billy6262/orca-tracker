April 21 - Our morning trip began in sunshine and relatively smooth water, and we quickly found gray whale
#531
about a half mile
north of Fox Spit
on Whidbey Island. We then turned south and caught up with
#49, Patch at the south end of Camano Island
. Both were in fairly shallow water, so were not tail fluking, but we got good looks at their distinctive side and back patterns. Patch has especially distinctive markings, with his namesake big white patch on his back.
For the afternoon trip, the wind came up and the clouds moved in, but we spent some great time with #49 again, then moved north, toward some big heart shaped blows in the distance around Baby Island. However, one of our sharp-eyed passengers spotted
#22, Earhart, off Fox Spit
. As we were admiring her,
#383
showed up! They were traveling north at a speedy (for gray whales!) 6 knots, and engaging in some activity, throwing up their front pec fins and a half of a tail fluke. They both did lovely big fluke up tail dives, so we were able to confirm their identities. One the way back to the marina, we spotted an unidentified whale very close to shore, just north of Langley. Another lovely day on Saratoga Passage, as our time with our beloved Sounders draws to a seasonal end. It's been a privilege to spend time with these amazing animals since March, and be reminded how very lucky we are to share a habitat with them. Bon Voyage, as they head back up to their far north feeding grounds in a few weeks. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.
