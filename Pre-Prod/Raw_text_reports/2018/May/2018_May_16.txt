Hi there! Today I met one of you at Ebey's landing. You were doing a presentation for a CHE field trip. I showed you a video off the
whale that has been hanging out in Crescent Harbor
and you asked me to send them to you guys. So here they are. Videos taken Wednesday (16th). And he is still there. Just seen half an hour ago by my husband (Friday 18th at
4:30). -Sara Walter
