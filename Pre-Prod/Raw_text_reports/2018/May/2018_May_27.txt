Stephanie from the San Juan Clipper reported the
T65As

7:55 pm
, heading north quickly from
Appletree Cove toward Point No Point
, between the shore and mid-channel.

6:15 p.m. -
one group still just north of
Apple Tree Pt
. Quite active, tail lobs, etc. moving very slowly. Several groups were ahead. -Sara Frey
*

5:25 pm -
Think all groups may have stayed together, looks like
3-4 groups off Apple Tree Point
still powering northbound in now choppy seas. In the past 30 minutes 3 cities (cruise ships) have gone by northbound. Lots of surface activity from orcas, tail lobs and breaching by male as the ships approached the pods. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

4:15pm, just south of Edmonds
. We were 400 yards away (laser rangefinder). But here's the slam to the two boaters that went in front of the whales path. Even though you shut off and raised your outboards, getting that "right past your boat" photo for your kids is not legal. Stay out their path and don't stress the whales. We've had a lone whale come right by our boat a few years ago as the main pod passed 200 yards away. We were already drifting with engines off, so it was quite the experience, but we didn't intentionally get into the whales path. -Steve Marczewski

May 27th on the Saratoga was great in part because we found whales nearby in Puget Sound and in part because there were
