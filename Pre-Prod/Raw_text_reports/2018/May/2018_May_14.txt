Orca Sightings for May 14, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
With reports of whales, we set off towards Sidney Island in Canadian waters! Passing Colville Island by Lopez Is, we checked on the harbor seals hauled out, then saw Dall's porpoise along San Juan Island, continuing north to find the T101s and T102 again! So cool to see these 4 whales two days in a row! We had great views of them as they passed
Sidney Island
, still northbound. Homeward bound we checked on the seals and Steller sea lions on Spieden Island. It was another spectacularly sunny day and our trip home inter islands added to the amazing day!
T101A (born 1993) and T101B (born 1997) on the left, Mom T101 (born 1973) in the middle, and T102 (born 1984) on the right.

WA State Ferries called in a report of
two grays seen from the Mukilteo Clinton ferry headed NW at
7:40 am
(the message said southbound, headed NW, but we think they may have meant the whales were south of the ferry run, headed NW?)

Early this morning, I woke at

2:00 am the the sound of gray whale blows
. The water was totally calm, no wind, all quite. I meandered back into my dreams listening to the whale go farther and farther away into the night. North from Pebble Beach. -Peg Boley

Gray whales (South Puget Sound) -

Entry 6:
Budd Inlet
- Update from CRC with link:
A gray whale
was spotted this morning near Olympia, WA. We have been tracking the movements of several gray whales sighted in southern Puget Sound in recent weeks. Thus far there have been indications that this year may be one of elevated gray whale mortality, with potentially more whales in poor body condition. Read more about these indications on our website. -Cascadia Research Collective

We also had a message tonight about a whale in Olympia, off
704 Columbia st
. by the Anthony's restaurant. Call was from WA State Patrol, at

6:54 pm
, relaying a report from someone, they thought it was a gray and that it might be lost.
