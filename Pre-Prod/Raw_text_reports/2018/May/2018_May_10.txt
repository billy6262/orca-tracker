Orca Sightings for May 10, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
In
Yaquina Bay (Newport)
on Thursday 05-10-18 at approx.

9:05 pm
PST from the end of the public fishing pier near the South Beach Marina looking north-ish toward the Coast Guard HQ, I saw
a lone, presumably male(?) Orca
in Yaquina Bay. It was getting dark enough at that time for the CG HQ's lights all to be on, dark enough that I was surprised my camera would even attempt to take a picture, but attached is the photo I got as the Orca headed out of the bay toward the jetties....I've seen orcas in the bay before, and as before, this one simply appeared to be cruising around, checking things out. The sea lion population seemed unperturbed. -Howard Shippey
