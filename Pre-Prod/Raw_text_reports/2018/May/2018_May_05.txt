Orca Sightings for May 5, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Boundary Pass
...In the
afternoon, the T90s and T2B
gave us a different kind of challenge. Though they had beautiful lighting on them and a beautiful background, they were in stealth mode, surfacing infrequently and changing direction often as they traveled north into Boundary Pass. -Justine Buckmaster

Entry 2:
T65As plus?
This was today at

3:40pm
in front of the lighthouse at
Pt. Wilson
, heading west into the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Entry 8:

11:17 a.m. -
pod is now slightly
north of Eglon, Kitsap still heading north
towards Point No Point very much on Kitsap side. Still, the only boats on scene that I can see are: PSE Saratoga, w/Red Head approaching from north and Island Explorer coming from Possession. I've not seen one other boat go near this family the two hours I have been watching, which has been a huge welcome relief considering the many hundreds of boats out there for opening boating day.

10:23 a.m. - pod is north of Kingston dock
. And for record and has been a relief: I've not seen one private motorboat approach the pod, nor any of the gazillion sailboats, they are all just going about their business boating while the whales navigate them on this day of mass human water activity. Only the Clipper and Saratoga have been on scene. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

9:59 a.m. - Orcas spotted mid channel by channel marker adjacent to Kingston ferry terminal
(buoy is south of) slowly heading north. -Darlene Moneypenny

9:40 a.m. - T65As (+?)
on the move northbound slow steady pace between
Point Jefferson, Indianola
, Kitsap and Richmond Beach in Shoreline. Victoria Clipper is leaving.

9:15 a.m. -
Pod appears to be on a kill? Lots of surface activity and not making forward progress. Mid channel between Port Madison and Richmond Beach amongst the hundreds of sailboats and other watercraft, none within many hundreds of yards of them at this time. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
...we saw
transient killer whales
twice on the San Juan Clipper! In the morning, just outside Seattle, we met up with the
T65As
(and got to meet their newest family member!) as they sped
across Puget Sound from Port Madison to Point Wells
, not even slowing down as they fed on a porpoise they caught! The T65As insisted on remaining back-lit for the entire encounter, which made photography challenging...

... just passed Indianola pier heading east. Victoria Clipper with them. -Sue Larkin

Entry 10:
(
ID notes by Melisa Pinnow, CWR: "shows others because you have
T65A4 and T65A3
in there but that lead descending fin is not a T65A member.
T65A2 & T65A3, Calf T65A6 & breacher (mom T65A?) .
Pretty sure the individual furthest to the right isn't either.
)

on Saturday! - Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research
