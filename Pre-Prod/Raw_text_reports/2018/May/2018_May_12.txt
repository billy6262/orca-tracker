Orca Sightings for May 12, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Guemes/Bellingham channels - At around

1:45
Sunday
May 12th off the
SW side of Guemes Island
I sighted
a large solitary Orca
. Very large dorsal. It was headed southerly towards the NW point of Fidalgo... I was ready to take photo but it didnt surface again nearby so afraid no photo. I only saw surfacing twice. Being a San Juan boater I've seen them before so I know a really big dorsal when I see one, and this was a biggie!! -Ken Osborn

as of now he's still circling in the area. He just went out of our sight up into

4:00 p.m. -
Whale in
Hammersley Inlet
today around 4PM headed into the
port of Shelton
. Looked like it was feeding, as it rolled onto it's side and slapped it's fin. No dorsal fin so I think it was a
Gray Whale
. Sorry no photos, I didn't have my phone. -Jody Johnson

3:35 p.m -
Good afternoon. We are watching what appears to be
a single grey whale in Hammersley Inlet

Entry 12:
3:45 p.m. - South of Bush Point
- mid passage/wind line. Watching it from Dolphin Drive porch...A small passenger cruise boat Constellation heading to Anacortes actually stopped mid channel and watched it - had better view. We
thought it was a large grey
based upon the size of the fluke. It stayed in place for about 45 minutes then we lost it. -R Miller
