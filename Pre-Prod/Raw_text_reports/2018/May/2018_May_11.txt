Friday
May 11th - with no reports of whales close by, we headed out - first checking a California sea lion on a channel marker, then west via the San Juan Islands, and were viewing several Steller sea lions and harbor seals by Speiden Island when we heard - Whales!! We quickly turned north towards
Sucia and Patos Islands
, and found the
T123 group of Transient/Biggs killer whales, Mom T123, her son T123A and daughter T123C
. We had amazing views of these 3 on a sunny windless day, perfect conditions. Homeward bound via the north side of Orcas Island, we enjoyed seeing some harbor porpoise and more seals/sea lions, and incredibly beautiful scenery. What a day - well done Capt. Eric! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
