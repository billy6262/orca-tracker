Orca Sightings for May 24, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had to go really far north to get to whales on the San Juan Clipper on
May 24th, but it was so worth it! We met up with the
T101s
and watched them feed on harbor seal near
Saltspring Island
. Later, we also caught up with some charismatic Steller Sea Lions on Whale Rocks. -Photo by Justine Buckmaster,

port angeles harbor
, just milling around.

There are at least
2 orcas in Port Angeles harbor
right now. Im super new to whale watching (this is my first time seeing one in person) so I dont know what else to say to describe them. There are whale watching boats all over the harbor. -Christina Baze

Just saw a
gray whale off the Bremerton
ferry going past Bainbridge! It was on the south side of Bainbridge by Fort Ward. It wasn't traveling at the time I went by. It was just playing in the water the whole time I saw it. -Sean Briere

Spotted from

5:30 pm eastbound Seattle-to-Bremerton
ferry,
a solitary whale heading east into Rich Passage
, midway in the channel near salmon net pens. The captain announced that a spout had been seen - the ferry would be slowing its progress until we cleared the area where the marine mammal was spotted. A few moments later (
6:05 pm, Tuesday,
May 24) passengers were treated to four more spouts ahead of the slowed down ferry. Then it looked like the whale sounded, as we saw a wide fluke rise in the air and disappear below the water surface... and then nothing further. We were looking into the sun, so I couldn't make out whether it was a small grey whale fluke or a large orca. Others on the ferry may have had a better view and/or photographs. Here is the approx. location where we saw the whale: 47.570491,-122.529671. -Brian Johnson, Bremerton
