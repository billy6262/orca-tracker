We rounded out the month of May with orcas again! Today we traveled along the
north side of Orcas Island
to look for whales, and caught up with the
T101s and T86As
heading towards
Spieden channel
. This is the 3rd time we've found the T101s this May - but first time for the T86As. There were 7 whales and we had some great viewing as they meandered by Spieden Island. Homeward bound, inter-island, we found a lot of seals hauled out, harbor porpoise, a California sea lion, and several Bald eagles. And spectacular scenery all day. June is "Orca month" - so let's now see what's in store for the month of June.
