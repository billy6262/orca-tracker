Orca Sightings for May 23, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Unidentified killer whales -

6:20 p.m. - Orcas appear to be heading out from Admiralty Inlet
Just South of Pt. Wilson in the SB traffic lane. Not sure of number/type, didn't get a good look at them. I am certain it was Orcas, I couldn't tell if there were any males, the majority of the pod was too far off to see clearly. -James Greenway

Entry 4:
Humpbacks
today on the Saratoga! Beautiful weather up by
Turn Point
in northern Haro Strait with beautiful creatures. One of these guys breached when we first arrived! I didn't have my camera ready for that one, but caught some pec slapping a little later! We also saw several harbor porpoise in the same area. -Justine Buckmaster
