3:40 p.m. - T65As currently southbound just east of Minor Island
. They are aming towards Admiralty Inlet right now. -Bart Rulon, Glacier Spirit

Many orcas reported in various areas around the Salish Sea, so we sped up to the
southwest side of Lopez Island
to watch the lovely Bigg's (meat-eating) family of the
T65As
, a matriarch and her beautiful offspring, including a brand-new (April) calf! We took a brief look at harbor seals and Steller sea lions, then caught up with the
T65As again just west of NAS Whidbey air base
. It was wonderful to see this baby and his/her family as they were traveling south. The tides and currents were favorable, so we slipped into Deception Pass on the way home. A great day on Mystic Sea! Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist. -Bonnie Gretz

I relocated a couple miles south of

11:40 a.m
- The pod continued west then south passing through the ferry lanes a bit west of mid channel. Currently (

All heading southbound with some directional changes, tail lobs, rolling, and little ones porpoising their way down the channel. So sweet. Viewing from Mukilteo Lighthouse Park.

Coastal killer whales - I'm writing to report a possible orca sighting at Seal Rocks on Saturday,
May 26th. I saw the request for reports yesterday at Hatfield Marine Science Center. Details:
Time: Approximately
4pm
on 5/26
Total
number of whales: 1
(unknown if it was male or female)
Direction: Unsure-it moved in a circular pattern. My daughter and I were descending the path from the highway in front of
Seal Rocks RV Cove
when we spotted the dorsal fin just to the left of the rocks. It was very close to shore but we were not able to catch it in a photo-it moved in a small circular counter-clockwise movement and then disappeared. We had been spotting gray whales frequently throughout the day in the same location, but this was very different! We both noticed it right away, but then didn't see it again in the three days we stayed there. -With best wishes, LeAnn Adam, Oregon State University

May 26 - Hi, Lori Christopher asked me to send you these pictures and videos. Taken yesterday (26th) morning from the beach on the
east side of Hat Island
....We really enjoyed it, not more than 10 yards off the beach. It's nice to know her name. -Kirk Lee
