At least 6 orcas (one baby, and possibly a bull (large dorsal fin) spotted E side of Blake Island
just past the rocky marina wall. They were circling and very active, we thought they might be feeding but we didn't see any blood or other food evidence. There was a small juvenile in the pod, and one with a very large dorsal fin (possibly a male) They appeared to be feeding, but no evidence of food. They were circling for awhile, and very active, jumping out of the water and spinning circles. -Stephanie Oster

2:30 p.m. - Gray whale Bells Beach, Langley
. Spotted a gray making his/her way toward Freeland, about mid-channel. White patches seen on body, but not on tail, when he/she dove. This whale negotiated around a large odd boat that was heading North as well. It looked military with a black body and a tall "lookout" in the front that was at least 2 stories high. -Peggy Sullivan

11:46 am - one gray traveling north just passing marina NE Gedney
, looks bound for Saratoga passage. -Lori Christoper
*

Entry 8:
3:18 p.m. -
It is back. Just now. Heading south again into
Budd Inlet
- just at the entrance passing between Burfoot Park and Cooper Point spit across the waterfront each other. Same surfacing behavior....a small blow and shallow arch followed by a larger, more robust blow followed by a significant slow taller arch. Then a long dive. My husband is home and HE GOT TO SEE IT!!! It's not moving anywhere very fast. It never fluked while I was watching it....but it is very distinctive in spine/knuckles and lice, etc. So it is clearly I.D.able for either past of future images. -Kim Merriman
*
~

9:00 a.m - Noon - Gray whale in Budd Inlet
. Headed south passing Boston Harbor on a very slow surfacing series. Two surfaces (the first one faint, then the second one more robust) with more of its back cresting the surface...Very distinct 'knuckles' as it looks like a humpback whale but with the dorsal curve heading the opposite direction. It did two of these series and then long dives....Cascadia Research was contacted and they put a team on the water. The whale eventually turned around and headed back north, on the Cooper Point peninsula side. Direction of slow and wandering travel is still heading north. And still in Budd Inlet. -Kim Merriman

Entry 9:
Two juvenile humpback whales
have been feeding in
Boundary Bay
over the last two days. One is a two year old known as "
Google
", the
2016 calf of BCX1188 "Jigger"
, originally documented by the Marine Education & Research Society. Humpback whales feed on a rage of zooplankton and small fish, and it was clear that Google and friend were feeding on some species of zooplankton rather than fish like herring, as local whale watchers could see dense swarms of the small creatures in the water where these two whales were lunge feeding. See Facebook VIDEO. -Tasli Shaw
