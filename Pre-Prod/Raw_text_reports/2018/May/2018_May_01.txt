Day report: First saw
T65As around
11:15 am
just north of the town of
Eldon
with them being closer in until
Triton Cove State Park around noon
(for about a half hour, was truly orca blessed, to capture some awesome moments quickly). About Triton Cove SP is where they started to move out further east near mid channel, but
heading north towards up into Dabob Bay
. Met up with my friend Alisa just after that and we stopped at a few other places to watch them and ran into new friends...we landed at
Point Whitney
north of
Brinnon
, beautiful place. We all met there for at least 2+ hrs patiently waiting for the orcas to come back out of
Dabob Bay (north bay)
, they had to, they could not swim any further north at that point, its a dead end. Beautiful beach and mountains on our left side and the water on our right side. Met some awesome whale outdoorsy enthusiasts....loved this one family, mama and her 3 incredible young children, the daughter who I think she told me was 8, she could run the Langley Whale Center on her own, she knew so much. Their mama is amazing; just watching the dynamics of this family was pretty cool...Point Whitney is also where Alisa and I met up with Susan and Howie, Sweet Briar Pup and after leaving there, met up with Ken. To be with those four friends warmed my heart to pieces. A few of my photos I am pleased with. I love the stillness of the waters and reflections. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 10:
~
6:30 p.m. -
While we (Susan Berta, Howard Garrett, Marilyn Armbruster, and myself along with others) were on shore watching the T65As across
Dabob Bay in Hood Canal
, Howard caught notice of these
Dall's
in his binoculars. This pod of Dall's (at least 3) were much closer to use on the Hwy 101 side off north end of
Seal Rock Campground, Brinnon
. So exciting and sweet to see these Dall's who used to be more abundant in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea and are rare these days.
