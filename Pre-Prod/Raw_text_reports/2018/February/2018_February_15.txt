Video shows
2 males, 1 calf, 1 female and another young
. ID note by Melisa Pinnow: "If the video is the one with the two males, my guess is that it was
T124C, T87, and the T124A2s
."

1:50 p.m. - at least 2 orcas in Puget Sound, off Faye Bainbridge Park
, heading south, west of mid-channel. Reported by Susan Andersson.

We saw about
5 orcas
(15th) morning as well....We probably saw these same orcas, just earlier. They appeared to be diving deep, I usually just see them continuosly on the surface.
8ish am, headed south Hansville side of Possession

Entry 2:
137's today in the San Juans

10 Orcas spotted at Ford's Cove, Hornby Island, BC early this morning

up the Lambert channel
and back down south,the same way they came. Multiple kills during the day. Another amazing day kayaking Hornby Island. T100's? T124A1 and someone else, Ford's Cove Hornby Island.
