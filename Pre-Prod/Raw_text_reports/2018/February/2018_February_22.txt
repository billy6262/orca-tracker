This morning, as the sun hit the water in blinding fashion, I got a call from Chris Hamilton with a report of "orca in the hood." I ran to the deck in sub zero weather and 60 mph winds to see if I could see them. I COULD! They had just entered
Eld Inlet
(so they passed right in front of me without being detected) and they were all doing what I call the "Whale Happy Dance." They were so active that I could hardly keep up. Breach. Tail slap. Spy hop. Head stands. Pectoral slap. Roll. Repeat. :) I had to go inside to warm up. And I could hear the tail slaps and breaches inside the house! They stayed in this same are for a long time, with lots of tail slaps, breaching, spy hops and other social behavior that is common after they have made a 'kill' and that I missed witnessing (one of the photos shows the oil slick from that) and everyone was happy! After some time, they traveled a bit further south into Eld, passing Sanderson Cove and on their way to Flap Jack Point. About 20 minutes later, I could see the strong blows of the animals now exiting Eld Inlet near Cooper Point heading north with a purpose. As they passed, I could see a lone and scared seal at the edge of the beach. But
the whales were moving quickly north, mid channel
. I lost sight of them in the high chop and biting north wind as they approached Harstine Island area. I do not know if they went north up Dana Passage or hung a west and went toward Steamboat Island and waters in those inlets. SO GRATEFUL!!! As they faded out of sight, I sobbed. Such a gift to be able to share a few moments with such magnificent animals.

4:15 p.m. - Ts exiting Budd Inlet
heading north. That is Cooper Point Spit in the foreground. The body of water on the bottom is Eld Inlet.

4:10 update
. The whales are
still in the Budd/Eld inlets
vicinity. They have circle around and headed into the entrance of Budd Inlet. Quickly swung around and headed north again on the far shore (toward Boston Harbor/Zangle Cove) and are now out of sight yet again. VERY hard to spot unless they are on their pattern - long dive followed by a three X surfacing series. I lost sight in the chop as they were headed north and if they keep on that trajectory, they are angled toward Dana Passage.

3:36 p.m. -
They are there again. Almost missed them. I was on the beach and as I came inside, I turned around and there they were heading east from Eld Inlet toward Zangle Cove. Mid channel. Long dives. VERY tough to see them due to chop and wind.

1:08 p.m. -
They are still here. I can see them from my front room breaching on the
south side of Harstine
- even in huge whitecaps. Too far away for photos. Cannot tell if they are going north up Dana Passage or west toward Steamboat Island and inlets over there.

12:35 p.m. -
They are now heading north and traveling fast. Porpoising and tail slapping along the way. Now on long dive. Mid channel heading straight to Harstine Island. I lost sight in the wind and whitecaps.

11:47 a.m. -
I can still see them and now they are traveling south toward
Flap Jack Point
.

11:37 a.m. -
Still in roughly the same place. I can't tell if they made a kill. Wild waves and a weird "patch/spot" on the water just north of where they are (photo viewed showed oil slick from kill - alb) They are taking a few long dives. Huge tail slaps, breaches, blows and other surface activity. Slightly and slowly heading south into Eld...

11:05 am - Orcas in Eld Inlet
. They are just south of Cooper Point very active staying in the same place. Now heading into hot light (sun glare). LOTS of tail slaps a breaches. HUGE. Blows.
T124A2 Eld Inlet

Saw them (orcas) from
Otso Point
(Anderson Is., Puget Sound)...they were headed south west towards the end of Long Branch. Amazing. Wonderful way to start the day. -Ellen Ross Kaspi
