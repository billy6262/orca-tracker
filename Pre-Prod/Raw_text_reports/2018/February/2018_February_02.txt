Orca Sightings for February 2, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - Center for Whale Research encounter with J pod: "...At about
1210
, a few killer whales were reported
in San Juan Channel
. Dave and Melisa hurried to Snug Harbor and left aboard "Orcinus" at 1250. With help from Jeanne Hyde, "Orcinus" located the first group of whales
a mile northwest of Yellow Island at 1316
. The first group was made up of
J16, J41, J42, J50, and J51
and they were slowly traveling northwest. Trailing few hundred yards behind them was another group that contained
J22, J36, J37, J38, J40, J45, and J49. J26
appeared further inshore toward the San Juan Island shoreline and paralleled the two groups while
J19 and J39
surfaced a few hundred yards ahead of everyone.
J27 and J31
also trailed behind the groups..." See full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 5.

Southern Residents - Wonderful to see
J-Pod
today! Several of us waited patiently at
Reuben Tarte County Park
today as J-pod plus L87 slowly made their way up
San Juan Channel
. They formed a big resting group as they passed Jones Island before turning towards Spieden Channel. It is the first time in a long time that I have seen them travel in a big tight group. We were all so focused on the big group that it was when we turned to leave Braunti spotted the
J17's and L87
heading strait for the park. All pictures taken from shore with 150-600mm lens and cropped! Enjoy!

We got to see
J-Pod today! J-Pod turned up in San Juan Channel this afternoon
! As they turned into Spieden Channel they were nice and close to the San Juan Island shoreline.Seeing the whales is always a gift, but especially today after a week of gray rainy weather and not feeling well. The sun even came out for a few minutes as we waited for their approach to
Reuben Tarte County Park
! At first they were spread out and moving very slowly north, but as they neared they grouped up into what looked like a resting line with the dramatic landscape of Orcas Island behind them. On their last surfacing as they passed us, they made a distinct turn west towards Spieden Channel, so we re-located to a friend's property further north - good decision! The whales were still moving slowly and took their time getting there. While this wasn't my best photo of the day, I love it because it shows just how big
