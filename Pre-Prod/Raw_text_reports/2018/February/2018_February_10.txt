============================================================

Entry 1:
Puget Sound -
T124A2s & T87 -
4:13 p.m.
- I'm also at
Edmonds
. Just caught a glimpse through my spotting scope of a big dorsal and big splash in the direction of Useless Bay from my view point. Appeared to be heading east....They were way out there, I would guess 6 miles or so, appeared to be
heading towards Possession Sound
....Couldn't see them with binos, only the scope. They were way out. Saw them a couple more times before we left at about
4:45 pm. -Justine Buckmaster

1:55 p.m. - 4 orcas on west side of Possession Bar
(South Whidbey Island). Milling around looks like hunting perhaps....last saw them south of Scatchet Head a half mile or so. Matriarch

Saturday 2/10/18 - One gray whale, 20 feet in length. Gray, dark in color. Height of blow medium to high. No dorsal fin. Location: straight out at intersection of Water/Ocean St, 75-100 yards out. Traveling North but possibly circling. No fluke. Hope this helps. -Karen Prater
(
ID notes by John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research collective: "Sure looks like a gray whale but hard to tell much more than that. We do not have any other information I am aware of any early arrivals into the NPS area.
