- Hello, Today at 1pm from our boat we saw a pod of five killer whales
west of Dungeness Spit near Sequim
. They were heading west and had a very young calf. I believe there was an adult female and male and two smaller whales. The two smaller ones seemed closer in size to the adult female. -Jacqueline Laverdure, NOAA, Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary Education and Outreach Coordinator.
