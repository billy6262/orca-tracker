Entry 3:
a sperm whale in Johnstone Strait
. Lisa had been listening to and recording this whale from Orcalab for several days. The first and last acoustic recording of a sperm whale in Johnstone Strait was made by John Ford in
February 1984, but I am not aware of any confirmed sightings of this species in waters anywhere along the inner coast of BC until today! We managed to get some decent shots of it and the T137s as they swam past. Thanks to Paul Spng and Helena Symonds for tracking this whale acoustically and John for helping to verify that yesterday's acoustic recording was indeed of a sperm whale. -Jared Towers

Humpback BCY0584, or "Pillar"
as we have christened her, heads down on a dive (in the back) accompanied by an unidentified young whale. The two whales have been together now for weeks
off Pillar Point on the Olympic Peninsula
