Entry 2:
(
One of the morning reports had 8 NB off Vashon. I saw 6-8 off Jefferson Head in the early evening, but we've only photos of the T137s so leaving the possibility another pod was traveling w/T137s and left overnight? - alb

Double rarity. Well, you just never know. Snow is rare for us at sea level, so are orcas in our waters. Then one day you wake up and chase killer whales during a snowstorm. That makes these pictures are rather rare, and rather grainy, as the snow was coming down good while the whales came for a visit. I shot first from the Warren Ave bridge as they exited Dyes inlet, and then caught up to them at
Bachmann Park in Manette. There were two calves, two females, and a male.
They put on quite a show that thrilled all the numb toed watchers. -Steve Scholle Photography
