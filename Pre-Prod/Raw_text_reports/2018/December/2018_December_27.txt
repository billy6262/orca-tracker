============================================================

Entry 1:
Juan de Fuca Strait -
T93 & T97 -
Within minutes from our docks...we could see multiple blows from Humpback whales as we headed south after a minute or so we were fortunate enough to encounter two bull Transient Killer Whales right out
front of Sooke
. (55 year old T93 & 38 year old T97 who frequently travel together) After that we visited at least 8 of the 12 Humpbacks that were in the local area...Wow what a day! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal

Entry 2:
T49A2 & T65A2 ~

14:00 - Orcas
. Just wanted to let you know that we came across two kids at
Salmon Bank
, between the green buoy and shore, at about
2:00. They were milling about Salmon Bank, right near the green buoy for quite awhile...They may be the same two that have been hanging around the islands for the last week or so, T49a2 and T65a2. One is definitely larger than the other...Attached are two pics of the same orca that we came across...the smaller one, I couldn't get a pic of. They were milling about Salmon Bank, right near the green buoy for quite awhile. -Mariann Carrasco

Tom and Jane headed out on "Morning Star" to look for whales at 1000. At about 1150, whales were spotted in
Friday Harbor
. "Morning Star" was nearby, having searched Spieden and President Channel, and arrived on scene at about
1200. T49A2 and T65A2
were on the south side of the harbor, but changed direction and headed across the harbor to the north side before continuing north to Point Caution. Full encounter report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 110.

On Saratoga in the South Sound. We got reports of orcas heading toward the Tacoma Narrows bridge from the south, so we headed there from the north. We met up with the
T124A2s and T124Ds just south of Colvos Passage
, flying north on a strong outgoing tide. The weather was nearly the complete opposite of the day before. Hardly any wind, the sun peeking from behind the clouds and water like glass. It made for some excellent photo oppurtunities, especially when the group stopped to make a kill and feed just before the end of our encounter. -Justine Buckmaster

08:45 - Gray Whale
sighting off of
Bells Beach.
Hi Alisa, I had reported a gray whale sighting back on 10/17 that you said was overwintering and was #185. This morning we heard one heading north and ran down to the beach but it was too far off to tell if it was the same one. My husband actually heard one on Christmas Eve as well sometime in the morning. Always magical! (My neighbor who lives on the beach says there were 2 heading north. He also said a separate one was heading south? (his sighting slightly earlier, exact time unknown). -Robin Reich
