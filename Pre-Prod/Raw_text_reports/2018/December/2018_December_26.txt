Orca Sightings for December 26, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
T124A2s & T124Ds
on Saratoga was a very cold blustery day. Of all the days to forget my coat at home, I chose this one. My bad luck ended there, however, as just moments after leaving the Edmonds Marina we spotted a group of Transient Killer Whales hunting. It was family of 2 adult females, two juveniles, and two calves/younger juveniles. I tentatively ID'd them as the T124As but now I'm not so sure. Anyone recognize these whales? We last saw them heading south just off
Shilshole
and found them again the
next day near Tacoma
. -Justine Buckmaster

Entry 2:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -
Juan de Fuca Strait - 2 spotted
outside of Victoria headed North out of the the strait of Juan de fuca. One looks to be an adult male. Didn't see the other well enough. -Zak Hinckley

Entry 3:
13:00 -
OK, now
orcas are off Point Jefferson, Kingston
and heading south at a good pace much closer in and going towards the Port Madison/Bainbridge direction.

12:44 - Orcas
are south of the channel marker (yelllow buoy
between Kingston and Richmond Beach
) and from when I posted a while ago a smidge closer to the west side. Seem to be SLOWLY meandering south, but still busy doing whatever they are doing.

12:15 - Half dozen or so orcas
pretty well mid channel off
President Point Kingston
....they must be having lunch...a lot of activity...tail slapping, splashing, I saw one porpoise. I can only see them good with the binoculars. -Chris Beamer Otterson
*

12:09 - Orcas off President Point
south of Kingston, Kitsap side. -Joanne Graves
*
We saw
at least two orcas at about
7:45 this morning

Entry 4:
Enetai Beach (Bremerton)
. They were heading north - looked like they were going toward Agate Pass. -Deborah Short
*
GRAY WHALES -

Entry 5:
15:51 - J
ust spotted a
gray whale
(couldn't tell who it was) only 100 yards off shore in
Langley
, off of Seawall Park. Exciting addition to our wine tasting! Looked like it was probably feeding, came up a few times before we lost track. Was moving south to north. -Dave Calhoun
*

Entry 6:
3:30 a whale (likely gray)
entertained a number of us right off of
Langley
. I got some terrible pictures. I can't help but think that these whales are hanging around because they can't make the trip down south. -Bob Gentz
*
DOLPHINS -

Entry 7:
a bottlenose?
This Video does its size no justice. It's big. -Patricia Peachy Reynolds
(
video shared with Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research : "That is a dolphin, probably a
bottlenose
..."
)
