Orca Sightings for December 22, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
I know this is late and not very useful, but just found out how to report. A
pod of about a dozen? was heading south in the San Juan Channel
on Sat 12/22 about
1pm
. I can see others reported them, and I certainly can't identify them, but it was my first sighting since moving here this fall! -Cathleen Burns

Individuals from a larger group of
Bigg's Transients swimming in San Juan Channel

Entry 2:
T75Bs, T75Cs, T35As, T65A2, T65A4, and T49A2
for sure. Others I see but haven't yet ID'ed. Erin says
T38A
was present too....Sara Hysong Shimazu
*
..We didn't have to search too long to find whales, and many whales at that! We first came across
T65A2 and T49A2
making their way north up
San Juan Channel
, near Point Caution. The took us on a slow cruise north before we split off to visit with a larger group of orcas we'd seen heading south. It turned out to be over six more transient orcas, including T38A! Our friend and naturalist for Maya's Legacy helped identify the
T75Bs, T75Cs, T35As, and T65A4
as well. The whales took us south towards whale rocks where we visited with dozens of Steller sea lions...Island Adventures.

Some of a large group of
Bigg's orca
encountered in San Juan Channel on 12/22 (photos below). Although not 100% confirmed it looked like members of the
T35A's, T38's, T75B's and C's and T65A4, with T65A2 and T49A2
swimming separately in the opposite direction. The small calf might belong to T75C but again, that isn't confirmed. -James Gresham

Entry 3:
- Puget Sound
- Heard
T46 Transient Biggs
orcas were near. I first saw them from
Brighton Beach
traveling about mid channel towards Hat Island and westerly...once they got close to Sandy Point, I knew then they were heading up
Saratoga Passage
. they traveled fast...saw them from Langley but they were already heading north of mid channel towards Camano. I left Langley Whale Center and headed home, but stopping at Fox Spit. they were there...but again, middish channel, a few mid channel and 2 further over towards Camano Island....then I lost them around

3:00pm
.

14:45 - 3 orca in between Fox Spit and Elger Bay
heading north towards Camano State Park...mid channel

between Sandy point and Marina veering out to middish channel. Im heading to Langley

13:25 - From Sandy Pt. I see orcas,
they are apparently closer to whidbey and may be heading Saratoga.

13:00 - seen 2 orcas south mid Hat island
heading north. Seen from Brighton beach. -Marilyn Armbruster

12/22 on Saratoga began with reports of orcas in Friday Harbor. Weather was bad in the Straits so we planned to head there via Deception Pass. Well, we never got that far, thanks to the
T46s
! These orcas suddenly surfaced off our starboard bow. "Orca one o'clock!" I shouted when I spied
T46E
's towering dorsal fin. We quickly realized he wasn't alone, his mother and siblings spread all across the channel, heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island...
T46D
was well behind the rest as he often is, but all 5 (
T46, T46D, T46E, T46F and T122
) were there. We left the Killer Whales just off of Clinton and went to view a
couple of Gray Whales near Everett
. Later, we chased reports of a humpback, but never found it. Some nice views and pinniped friends appeared instead! -Justine Buckmaster

12:30 -
They are still moving north spread out across the Sound, now in line with
Mukilteo
ferry landing.

12:15 - Bigg's Transient orcas (T46s)
very spread out in
Possession Sound
. They are currently between Possession Point and Glendale, Whidbey heading northbound towards Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes. -Justine Buckmaster

HUMPBACK WHALES
-

Entry 4:
humpback whale between Richmond Beach, King County and Point Jefferson, Kitsap County from about

3:30-4pm
from my home at
Richmond Beach, WA
. Not sure if you can get an ID from these pictures, but thought it was worth a shot. It was pretty far out (I was shooting with a 500mm lens and still had to crop), and my photos are pretty grainy because the lighting was not great and I had to use a high ISO. The whale was first seen swimming calmly and popping up for air every 2-3 minutes; we usually saw 2-4 breaths before a dive with tail flukes. However, once he was about 12 o'clock from our viewpoint, we saw two full breaches followed by a head lunge. Then he went back to the previous behavior. From my experience, looked like a small whale, probably a juvenile? Let me know if these pictures are helpful! -Happy holidays, Anastasia Nicolov

14:30 -
I see "our"
humpback
out front west side of mid channel
between Pt. Jefferson and President Point Kingston
meandering north. Haven't seen it for several days....but then again the water hasn't been real conducive to seeing anything but high stormy whitecap waves!! -Chris Beamer Otterson
*

13:42 - (humpback)
Just saw a whale from off north Angeline (
Suquamish
). ...Just saw a bunch of blowing and a few tail fin splashes. Check the water it's heading towards Indianola. -Jenn Thurston

Elliot Bay. At 1200 noon
it was 9000 meters from Colman Dock traveling in a Northwesterly direction. -Burt Miller, wSF

NW towards Bainbridge
