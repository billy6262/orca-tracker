Orca Sightings for December 16, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES -
I spotted
an orca
(I can only confirm seeing one, but there might have been more) while on the Ferry from
Clinton on Whidbey over to Mukilteo
. I saw it very shortly after we departed. I was standing at the very front of the boat on the car deck, and there was no one else around, so I'm not sure if anyone else on the boat saw it. Date: 12-16-2018. Time:
3:07pm Location: Just southeast of Clinton Ferry terminal. I am fairly certain it was an Orca, but can't say with 100% certainty. In memory, the dorsal fin was a very clear feature, and I feel like I was able to see black and white coloration through the surface of the water. I also think I saw two dorsal fins (two whales), but can't say for sure. It was a very brief sighting, I was so excited that I ran back to the car to get my boyfriend and then I didn't see it again, I should have just kept my eye on it! -Fiona Booth
