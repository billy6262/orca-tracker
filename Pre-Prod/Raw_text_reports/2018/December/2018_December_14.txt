12:15 - 4-5 off Rose Point/Eglon,
closer to Kitsap side, heading fairly quickly southbound...Could only see their dorsal fins - they were moving right along quickly! -Rebecca French Gerke
*
Found them!
12:15 pm - seeing huge splashes in the distance, watching from S. of Bush Pt, the splashes look like they are somewhere
between Shoreline and Carkeek Park
, mid-channel. They must be breaching and lobtailing, they are so distant, only seeing the splashes and one glimpse of a big fin, direction of travel not yet determined. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

07:45 -
Just saw
4-5 orcas
running the beach south of the
Clinton ferry terminal
heading southbound. The male was trailing with one or two with him, one appeared to be small but its dusk so hard to tell. -Melissa Simmons, WSF
*

Entry 2:
3-4
heading north past
Centennial Park
. After some dialogue: could see little black backs ducking in and out of the water and they were fairly close to the shore and slowed down and sort of hung out near the grainery. They appeared larger than a porpoise or sea lion... Aisha Farooq

Entry 3:
gray
- alb)

16:00 -[gray] north of Hat Island marina
, northbound towards Camano. MORE: you know that was the first thought (gray) considering how close in it came. Was hard to tell, but didn't feed in the usual way and when it swam away it had a pronounced ridge so assumed it was hb. The exhalations were tall and lacked the heart shaped swirls, but It could have been a gray. -Lori Christopher
*
UNIDENTIFIED WHALES -

Entry 4:
13:21 -
Just saw
a tail
come up - maybe mid channel, slightly closer to kitsap side,
between golden gardens and carkeek.
....I was wondering if it was a gray or humpback as it hung out in the same area for awhile and it was before the orcas made their way south. I didn't really see a big fin on the back either. I live in northbeach between golden gardens and carkeek and the whale was more west on the other side of the channel. -Kristen C (aka Sir Winston)
