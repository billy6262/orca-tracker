T137A & T137B together not far from Whidbey shore, slow southbound. Not exactly sure  where other two are, but I presume in the vicinity though. Mile south of Long Point.11:42 - Appear to be southbound now.- Rachel Haight, Orca Network*11:47 - Flipped/headed back south.11:10 - Seeing fins and blows, from Long Point.

Almost out of view at Hidden Beach. Appears to be  just 137s so far.09:00 - At least three to five orcas, spread out  from Hidden Beach [Whidbey] can see T137, T137A and T137D at least.  Whidbey side of mid channel making directional changes but trending northbound with more purpose now after milling/probably feeding. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*08:30 - Holmes Harbor, Whidbey Island.

Group of orcas heading north. -back of camera photo by Danielle Lanxon, November 10, 2023*13:07 - We saw three to four whales in a tight group heading north (north-east?) from the Seattle-Bainbridge ferry. They were more or less in the middle of the sound between Bainbridge, Elliott Bay and slightly north of Alki point. -Jane Radstrom*13:05 - We saw four on the Seattle/Bainbridge ferry! Not familiar with who they are but was awesome! -Kate Williams*12:30 - Spoke with people at Constellation Park who had seen some transients come by the lighthouse and head west toward the north end of Blake Island. They seem to be out of view now. -Steve Rice*12:03 - Pretty sure I just saw at least one orca by the Alki lighthouse on the Bremerton-Seattle ferry. Heading more  towards the lighthouse so looked like maybe southwest. -Jerome Woodworth*12:00 - Orcas off 64th and Alki. -photos by Robin Sinner, November 10, 2023*10:59 - Stopped for a group of orcas on the Kingston fast ferry.
