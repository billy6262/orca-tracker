Entry 26:
14:26 - Hearing some very, very faint S1s so far. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Insitute*14:22 - Sara Frey called back and confirms residents. More soon. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*14:13 - More calls now on the Sunset Bay hydrophone. -Sara Montour Lewis, Our Wild Puget Sound*J42 Echo -ID by Brittany Noelle & Monika Wieland Shields, OBI*14:00 - Had one  group of orca - line of sight Apple Tree Point to the Edmonds marina -  probably four to six foraging, one large male, midchannel along the ferry route. Few minutes later, group very close to the Kitsap side -  100 - 200 yards. Confirmed open saddle. Southbound, one large male.  Traveling fast. -photos by Sara Frey, October 25, 2023*14:15 - On the phone with Sara again for last 15 minutes while she is seeing orcas streaming by some close inshore, all  southbound. Possibly some milling. Will be curious to see what those northbound Ts did. Fun call, exciting.13:59 - Sara called back to say seeing more including at least one large male still heading southbound.13:54 - Sara Frey called Orca Network to report single orca southbound off Apple Tree Point close in. Also pod of harbor  porpoise milling around.*13:54 - Viewing them from Sunset Bay. They are in the same general area as the previous update/map. Worth noting for anyone viewing them from the mainland, the past 20 minutes or so I could only see the exhales through binoculars, now I’m able to see the  dorsals. They are still quite a ways out still. West of mid channel. Milling, with a slow trend southbound. -Orca Conservancy*13:37 - Spread over here [approx. 47.852278,  -122.469783]. Long down times and some are facing north going back and forth but all trending south overall.  -Alice Thuy Talbot*13:26 - Watching from Eglon, have seen three to four spread out southbound, Kitsap side. -Sue Surowiec Larkin*13:04 - Seeing a fin mid to Kitsap side of mid approaching Eglon, heading south. -Jami Cantrell*13:02 - I can see leaders now in Possession triangle over by Eglon. One large male maybe two to three orcas total. -Alice Thuy Talbot*12:58 - Last update - they are a bit too far west for me to see much. Still look like hurried travel southbound. What might be trailing male is now passing southbound west of green buoy off Scatchet Head. Mirage effect at water level makes it nearly impossible  to see them from where I'm at.12:45 - Spotted a few blows southwest of Scatchet Head. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*12:42 - Me too, but so much extraneous noise. -Patricia Prochaska*12:41 - Definitely more now.12:38 - Just heard a faint call on the Sunset Bay hydrophone. -Sara Montour Lewis, Our Wild Puget Sound*12:15 - Still very fast travel southbound, large  spread. Locations I normally have plenty of time to get to, they are  just flying past. Leaders are likely approaching Maxwelton/South  Whidbey. Guessing these are the trailers a mile or two south of Double  Bluff.11:55 - In total travel mode, semi long down times, spread by one - two miles. At least three males, spread in a few groups of three to five, at least one group eight plus. Too far to be certain, but males’ fins resembled Rs. Moving south fast about exactly  midchannel. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*11:45 - Just on the phone with Rachel Haight who is seeing at least two larger groups spread. Look to be mid channel south of Bush Point out from Mutiny Bay. She cannot confirm but leans residents. She is viewing from high bluff Shore Meadows. She called back super excited to say a minke just popped up in front of them off Shore  Meadows facing eastbound.*11:38 - They are riding a huge flood tide now and moving fast. South of Bush Point. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*11:25 - Cindi Rausch called from Lagoon Point to update she sees the orcas, but they appear to be well on the Marrowstone  side. Superior mirage makes it difficult to confirm that and ecotype. Orcas are now well south of across from Lagoon Point. She and Rachel are heading south to try and get ahead of the orcas and hopefully confirm  ecotype at least.*10:31 - Laurie Baker, WSF Marine Ops, emailed at 10:55 to report: KENNEWICK at 1031hrs: Vessel reports via 800MHz they've  spotted 10-15 orcas spread out just off Marrowstone Pt, heading in a southerly direction. *BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Wed, Oct 25 - Puget Sound (T37As & T99s)16:50 - Approaching ferry lanes continuing northbound. 16:32 - They’re in Possession Sound going north saw a few blows I think one large male [approx. 47.938701, -122.326900]. - Alice Thuy Talbot*15:15 - 15:30 - On our way back in we saw a bunch of blows about two miles south/southwest of Possession Point. Based on  the ressie location I bet those Ts came east. -Brian McGinn*14:51 - Sunset Avenue, well beyond the Dive Park.14:47 - Five or so northbound approaching Edmonds ferry terminal. -Clint Jones*13:50 - I believe this is the group I just saw heading north of Kingston ferry line. Fast pace trending north closer to Kitsap side. -Jolena Tagg*13:37 - This group (37As and 99s) is powering northbound about at President Point, Kingston, in the southbound shipping lanes towards Kingston terminal. If they’ve heard the orcas to the north they are not changing direction. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*12:15 - T37As are northbound towards Point Jefferson, and we found another group of Ts about a mile south of the first group. Looks good for the 99s. Also northbound. Confirmed 99s. -Brian McGinn*12:05 - Orca moving northbound midchannel between Shilshoe and Bainbridge. Puget Sound Express with them. -Sue Surowiec Larkin*10:43 - Laurie Baker, WSF Marine Ops, emailed at 10:55 to report: 10:43 - TACOMA at 1043hrs: Vessel reports via 800MHz they've spotted 5 orca at Tyee Shoal [just SW of entrance to Eagle  Harbor] heading North in the traffic separation zone.*10:24 - Laurie Baker, WSF Marine Ops, emailed at 10:55 to report: CHIMACUM at 1024hrs: Vessel reports via 800MHz they've  spotted 3 orca at Tango buoy [between Restoration Point, Bainbridge and  Alki] heading North in the SB [southbound] traffic lanes.*Wed, Oct 25 - South Puget Sound (T109A2s) - Transients in Carr Inlet trying to show off but no one was watching!!! -photo by Noelle Morris, October 25, 2023*16:43 - Pod is milling just south of Salmon Beach. Close to Salmon Beach side. -Candace Gavin*16:04 - Orcas grouped northbound at Narrows  Bridge. Humpback also near by. Orcas crossed the bridge then disappeared  after deep dive. -Jason Cook*16:00 - We've had eyes on them at Narrows Park. Milling around but trending slowly maybe north/northeast toward Titlow.  Down for probably five minutes now though. -Dave Bergmann*14:58 - A few popped out [approx. 47.216495, -122.622871] shout out to the white boat staying far back and moving slowly. -Tiff Shih*15:05 - Just passed our home, heading fast to the south end of Fox Island. -Laura Kozar Batanian*14:51 - Just passing through still on west side of Fox Island. -Kai Hearn*14:26 - West side of Fox Island (between Fox and McNeil).14:19 - Just passing tip of Fox Island heading south - shout out to boat  following at respectful distance - thank you! -Serena Scott*13:31 - They have reached the entrance to Hales Passage.
