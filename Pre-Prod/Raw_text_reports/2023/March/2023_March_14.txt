They blew by Manchester so I bypassed Bainbridge for Kingston, wrong move. Such a  beautiful day! -photos by Jim Pasola, March 14, 2023*19:35 - Last sighting of the night: Pod was regrouping south of the yellow mid channel buoy between Richmond Beach  and President Point, Kitsap and moved over east side of the channel. We all moved to Kayu Kayu Ac park to catch them in the last specs of daylight. We arrived at Kayu at ~ 19:35 to see them directly off the park in tight group gliding along, surfacing in a dark water patch of glassy calm sea. Was serenely beautiful with low light and sundown colors. They continued north went on a dive and stayed under for many minutes. We did see some fins surface a bit north and still off the park facing north, now loosely grouped, but soon lost them to the dark of  night. What a beautiful night.19:20 - Orcas cut over after that interaction, group is split. Group of 4-5 including male mid channel just east of, between transect Richmond Beach and Jefferson ahead. Steady northbound with some logging. Two other males north of Jefferson Head Kitsap side.19:15 - Kitsap fast ferry stopped and turned on a dime. Pod popped up right in front of them as they were going 30 knots. Impressive maneuver. Ferry stopped. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*19:13 - Shout out to whoever is driving the Kitsap fast ferry. Impressive “stop on a dime” maneuvering to give the whales space. Still northbound midchannel off Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. -Ariel Yseth, Whale Scout*18:58 - They are stalled out logging [approx.  47.725497, -122.445870].

In general out from mid Port Madison. Sublime day. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*18:47 - I've got the whole group straight off the Suquamish Pier probably west of mid channel. -Jim Pasola*18:38 - So they just booked it past Fay Bainbridge State Park northbound more towards Edmonds side of the channel. -Kelly Kauffman Wisniewski*18:34 - Heading northeast out of Port Madison.18:30 - Leaders heading north at a fast rate.
