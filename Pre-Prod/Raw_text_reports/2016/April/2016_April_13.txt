7:15 pm - we watched the orcas meandering north from Hidden Beach
, well spread out in small groups, one large male (I won't say it was Doublestuf J34, but odds are on...) traveling alone mid-channel and seemingly in the lead, throwing in a couple of breaches for good measure. No time to check photos yet. -Sandra Pollard

5:59 p.m. - Orcas headed north from Baby Island
, I can see them from Fox Spit, closer to Whidbey. -Sara Young

Sandra Pollard relayed a message from about

3:20 this afternoon
from Marilyn Hrycenko of Holmes Harbor, that 6
-8 orcas were seen heading south past Honeymoon Bay
, deep into Holmes Harbor, again. Assuming this is the
J22s and J17s
, this is the fifth day in a row they've gone into shallow water in Holmes Harbor. Maybe the place is full of Blackmouth chinook.
