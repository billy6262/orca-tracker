Orca Sightings for April 30, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
T065B1
at close range yesterday in
Haro Strait
. T065A (R) & offspring in Haro Strait. The T065A's and B's were less than a mile from Humpback Big Mama and her calf and were headed towards each other, but the transients didn't bother the humpbacks. The
T065A's and B's
had been submerged on a deep dive and surfaced right next to us. This 5 yr old's dorsal fin is already sprouting. I think he's going to be a big boy. -James Gresham

Today out on the Island Whaler with
# 49 patch and # 383 in Elger Bay
moving south. -Terica Ginther

Big Mama
, a pioneer, one of the first humpbacks to return after a 100 years of absence to the Salish Sea. We are excited and smoking a cigar because she is back with a new calf! We believe it to be the 6th. Both Big Mama and her calf were breaching when we sailed to Beaumont Shoals today. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing

Breaching humpback calf. This is the 2016 calf of the much loved humpback Big Mama
. Photographed today in
Haro Strait southwest of Lime Kiln
. As we (Island Adventures Whale Watching) slowly moved into position both Big Mama and the calf began breaching repeatedly. They breached together at one point but I didn't get shots. The calf breached at least 10 times while Big Mama repeatedly lobbed her flukes. We sat at stand off distance with engines off and watched in amazement. After awhile the acrobatics stopped as quickly as they started and Big Mama moved north up Haro with her calf. The T065A and T065B transient orca were less than a mile away at the time and were headed south but the marine mammal eating orca ignored the humpbacks. Great to see an apparently strong and energetic calf for Big Mama this yr. Shot at 500mm and cropped. -James Gresham
