Orca Sightings for April 21, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage - Nature in the raw... Shortly after leaving Langley marina, we caught up with
two groups of transient orcas (marine mammal eating orcas), south of Camano Head
. The whales milled for a while before becoming more spread out as they picked up the pace towards Port Susan, until diverted by a Pacific harbor seal crossing their path. A short, intense pursuit followed, but this lucky seal got away! We left the orcas continuing north as we headed back towards Camano Head, where we spotted the heart-shaped blow of
a gray whale, #44 (Dubknuck)
traveling south - away from the orcas. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
*

6:14 p.m. - At least 3 maybe 5 orcas heading north in Saratoga Passage off Onamac Point
. Closer to Camano side. At least one male! -Patti Nevaril-Cassell
*

2:00 p.m. -
Noticed no one else reported the a
dult male orca
five or six people saw from the
Boy & Dog park in Langley
. It was heading north and, as far as we could tell, solitary. Don't remember the exact time but it was around 2 p.m. First, appeared frequently straight out from the park, then disappeared for quite a while and then was spotted much farther north. -Mara Grey
*

1:47 p.m. - T049C all alone heading north off West side of Gedney
. -Renee Beitzel
*

11:52 a.m. -
Sandra reports the
Ts have moved east, into Port Susan
.

11:35 a.m. -
Sandra Pollard aboard Mystic Sea is watching
4 or 5 orcas, including one adult male, off the south end of Camano Head in Saratoga Passage
. These must not be the same ones that were seen from the Kingston ferry and off Pt. Wells just after 10 am, given that the distance is over 20 miles, too far to travel in one hour, and given that Renee Beitzel reports at
11:32: "another group of Ts in Saratoga and we also just found gray whale #44 in close proximity at south end of Camano island!"
*

4:05 p.m. - Puget Sound - Just saw a pod or Orca's from Alki.
Just off Bainbridge heading toward Magnolia. Pretty sure I saw a juvenile in the group! So exciting! Northbound but lost sight of them as a ferry was coming toward them. Haven't' see a sign of them since. -Rusty Garner
*

4:00 p.m. - Bainbridge ferry westbound spotted orcas
spouting and traveling
off Alki
. Family unknown. -Cornelia Talley
*

3:20 p.m. -
My friend Angela Mata is on the the ferry Kaleteen, Seattle to Bremerton run, there is
a pod of orcas currently to the SE of them, southbound
. The boat at the time of report was midway
between Restoration Point (Bainbridge) and Alki Point
. Good chance this is the pod that was off Richmond Beach and they turned back south. -Alisa LB
*

12:40 p.m. - Found a group of approx 4 large orcas heading north bound, seen from just south of Richmond Beach saltwater park
. They look to be just west of mid channel. Not visible without a good pair of binoculars!! Best seen from the highest point at Richmond beach SWP. -Kayli Ann Breitweiser
*

10:41 a.m. - Transients (no ID's yet) making kills but heading south-ish mid channel outside Edmonds
. -Renee Beitzel
*
11 a.m. - pod is still out mid channel bit north of out from Pt Wells
...definitely on a kill.

9:45 a.m. - surface activity north of Point Wells east of mid channel.
Viewed from a distance. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

This picture was taken aboard
the Walla Walla (Kingston-Edmonds ferry) at approximately 10 AM. The four orca were spotted just off of Kingston
in the traffic lanes headed southbound. -John Rogstad, Operations Watch Supervisor, Washington State Ferries
The Male is T123A. (ID by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research)
*

8:55 a.m. - Orcas seen off the
8:40 Kingston ferry,
headed south mid channel. Looks like transients, uneven dives. Right in the ferry lanes little to the south headed south.
About 5 animals, 1 male, couple females and younger adult
. -Sarah Hanke
*
Pod of orcas spotted on the Edmonds Kingston ferry about
8:45
. Closer to Edmonds heading away from Edmonds. -Dione Corey
*
We left the orcas continuing north as we headed back towards Camano Head, where we spotted the heart-shaped blow of
a gray whale, #44 (Dubknuck) traveling south
- away from the orcas. (full day report in Bigg's section). -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
