============================================================

Entry 1:
J16 & her 16 month-old daughter J50
-Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research ...The morning began with
J pod calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone around 0630
and a distant visual sighting by Jeanne Hyde a short time later of several dorsal fins and a breach
east of Beaumont Shoal on the Canadian side of the border in Haro Strait
. It took a little more than two hours before the whales came slowly past the Center for Whale Research headed northwest bucking an ebbing tide...See full Encounter 36 Report. -Center for Whale Research

After twenty years of watching these whales one of those magic moments I had been waiting for finally arrived. Today I was able to visit with
all of Jpod as they traveled through beautiful Active Pass
. It was truly an inspiring, humbling experience. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
