on the afternoon of
April 4th. -Mark Malleson

Three shades of gray today as we headed out to find whales - gray skies, gray seas, and
gray whales
, but the water was dead calm and perfect for sighting our local Saratoga whales! We found
#723 and #531 along the Snohomish Delta
, feeding along the shallow banks, back and forth. We had great looks at them as they fed on their sides, scooping up tiny crustaceans, with pectoral fins appearing to be waving at us. The gray skies turned blue for a short time, before the rain caught us as we headed back to Langley. Another fun day with our local friends -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
