Orca Sightings for April 28, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J34 in Sidney Channel in the afternoon
. -Mark Malleson
*

8:30 p.m. - Left J16's off Ripple Island heading for San Juan Channel
. Met them at Blunden as the sun was setting. At first they zig zagged and then doubled back and headed towards Johns Pass. It was after
8:30 and getting dark but we wanted to see where they were going to go!

6:45 p.m. - J16's nearing Blunden, pointed at Turn
. -Barbara Bender
*
I have been waiting fourteen years to have
J Pod
come through
Sansum Narrows which divides Maple Bay and Cowichan Bay
. This is a historic travel route for the Southern Resident Killer Whales. Since the downfall of the Cowichan River Chinook Salmon run in the 1980's the southern residents rarely come into Cowichan Bay. I was lucky enough to find them just entering Sansum Narrows resting but as soon as they got to the mouth of Cowichan Bay the fireworks started. This encounter made my year! -Simon Pidcock
*
Hard Core. We used the moderate to strong winds and the big ebb and flood to cover serious ground and watch serious whales.
Sidney Channel - J34, Doublestuf
, continual breaches and cartwheels expressed the power of the day. His mom, J22, similarly cartwheeled and even the kids were having fun. Vocalizing while fishing and exuberant with the exciting whitecaps. A thrill and an honor to sail in their presence. We broke away to meet the breakaway group, the
J16's, in the white caps of Blunden Island, Canada
. They surprised us by turning towards San Juan Channel with us as we plowed a beam reach homeward through sunset. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing

11:18 a.m. - Unidentifiable whale in shipping lane off of Vashon Island
drifting northwards towards Blake island. Drifting in surface and blowing occasionally. Hope it is not in distress. -Terry Blumer
*

11:00 a.m. - Humpback or grey whale in between Lincoln Park and Vashon Island
, main shipping channel. Floating, have seen some blows. -Sharon Blumer
