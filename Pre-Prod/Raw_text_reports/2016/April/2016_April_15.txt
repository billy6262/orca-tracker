Orca Sightings for April 15, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Headed up to
Point No Point
this morning to go birding. We hadn't been in the parking lot for more than 5 minutes when the most beautiful sight of
J34 Doublestuf
popped up North of the Point. After missing them for almost a week, I could barely believe my eyes. They were very spread out and there seemed to be foraging since as you can see, I have whales going both directions. -Connie Bickerton
*

6:10 pm - Long procession of orcas spread out and heading southeast into Puget Sound past Point No Point
. -Patty Michak.
*

3:00 p.m. - We saw two Orca whales at the entrance to Hood Canal around 3pm
. They were midway between Foulweather Bluff and Olele Point for about 30 minutes then started moving north into the main channel of Admiralty Inlet towards Whidbey Island. We could see them surfacing and hear them breathing from our kayaks off of Tala Point. -Mark McDonald
*

2:40 p.m. - they seem to be doing a lot of foraging between S. Marrowstone and Pt. Ludlow area
. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

12:40 p.m. -
they are in view again
south of Bush Pt
, a little closer to the Whidbey side this time, still going slow, possibly foraging. Watching a bald eagle watch the whales. J pod again stealing the thunder from the Gray whales, who we celebrate tomorrow. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*
Sandra Pollard called at

12:20 to report that the J17s and 22s reached the south end of Marrowstone Island
, then turned and headed back south with purpose! So maybe we will get them back in Puget Sound or Saratoga Passage yet!
*

11:45 a.m. -
they are moving pretty slowly, they were just out of sight here south of Bush Pt. a few minutes ago, likely approaching the point about now.

10:45 a.m. - Watching Js, just passed Foulweather Bluff heading west
, some foraging behaviors and a couple juvie breaches! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

I saw one dorsal fin through the bigeyes (35x) binocs, west of Point No Point. No obvious direction. -Howard, Orca Network

9:04 a.m. -
saw a couple of
dorsals off double bluff northbound
probably in sb shipping lane close to mid channel

8:29 a.m. - One male and one female heading north now towards Double Bluff
. More west of Point No Point northbound.

8:15 a.m. - Finally orcas! Only seen one male
, no direction yet, looks to be feeding north of Point No Point towards westside of Useless Bay. Not close, but on Kitsap side of mid channel. -Connie Bickerton
