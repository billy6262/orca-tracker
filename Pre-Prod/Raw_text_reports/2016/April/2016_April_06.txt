Cascadia Research update: A successful effort on the water in N Puget Sound with gray whales today.
Encountered all six of the regulars known to have arrived this year (21, 49, 56, 383, 531, and 723)
. Deployed two suction-cup attached, multi-sensor dual-video tags on 21 and 723 and these remain on tonight gathering data. Jeremy Goldbogen and Dave Cade from Stanford were working with us today. Two interesting gray whale reports came in during the day. The first was of
a very emaciated gray whale seen in the Ballard Locks in Seattle
today which got a lot of attention. The second was a photo Mark Malleson sent of
a gray whale seen today off Victoria that I immediately recognized as another of Puget Sound regulars (44 or Dubknuck)
apparently on route to where we were and which we hope to see tomorrow. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research

1:20 p.m. - Saw a juvenile gray whale at the Chittendon locks
, in Ballard...back inside but it was lingering for a while. In and out. They, obviously, aren't using that lock to keep the whale safe. Here's a video! What a crazy sight to see! -Jeffrey Stander

I live next to the Locks and went to watch him today not knowing he was in such bad shape.
Locks is telling folks it's a younger gray
who may have been separated from his mom.... He just kept circling in the channel. -Erin Graf

7:00AM - Another whale came to the locks
this morning. It's been hanging out around here again this morning. I saw it around

Hiram M. Chittenden Locks
(Ballard Locks) if you'd like to view it. -Katie McGillvray, Natural Resource Specialist
