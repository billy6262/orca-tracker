We first saw the
J17s and J22s coming up to the north end of Holmes Harbor just south of Greenbank around 2 pm.
They were pointed north when we saw them but not going anywhere, just logging and spyhopping. Within minutes they turned south and headed into Holmes Harbor for the second time today and where they were yesterday, but where Residents are very rarely seen. We went a few miles south and stopped at Holmes Harbor Vista and watched them pass slowly, continuing southward. We then went to the Holmes Harbor golf course and out on the floating dock just as they came by within 30' of the dock, again slowly, staying close to the surface. They got to between the golf course and the town park, where the depth drops to just a few feet over the mudflats. They continued logging and spyhopping in tight groups for about 20 minutes, then they slowly meandered back northward. We headed back north to the Holmes Harbor yacht club and saw them pass by, still going very slow, for another twenty minutes, then went back to where we started just south of Greenbank, and watched them move slowly northwest toward the beach into very shallow water before turning northward. We then went up to
Hidden Beach, just north of Greenbank
, and watched as they moved at only a slightly faster pace,
northward toward Penn Cove about 6 pm.
All members of both matrilines were present and no new babies were seen. Lots of blackmouth salmon, which are the non-migratory Chinook, were reported to be in Saratoga Passage, so possibly they are finding plenty to eat, but they didn't seem to be foraging. Instead they were in tight clusters, intensely socializing the whole time. I won't even venture an explanation of their bizarre behavior. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

Incredible encounter with the
J17's and J22's
in our immediate neighborhood,
Holmes Harbor
, Freeland. Delighted to see Susan Berta, Howard Garrett, Wendy Berta Sines, and the intrepid Haight family, Rachel Haight, Josh Haight and daughter Lily, enjoying land-based whale watching from the dock. -Sandra Pollard
*
The
J17s and J22s
delighted us by coming close to shore, traveling all the way into
Holmes Harbor
and back out, past Greenbank, then they headed north up Saratoga Passage after we left them. What a great day, and getting to see two of the new babes! -Susan Berta
*
What a day! Again, I started the day at Hidden Beach and ended at Hidden Beach. Except today,
J pod went back and forth in Holmes Harbor multiple times
. They passed close by Dines Point several times and had an incredibly close pass by at the dock at the
Holmes Harbor golf course
. We also saw an osprey catch a fish, have an eagle chase it, causing the osprey to drop the fish, the eagle tried to get the fish but didn't; two more eagles flew in, and two of them locked talons. No one got a fish, but this moment made me forget about orcas altogether (for a split second!), such a unique sight to witness! It was another beautiful sunny day spent with J pod and orca loving friends. Perfect. -Rachel Haight
*
J17s and J22s in Holmes Harbor
. It was a beautiful visit with spyhop happy babies (and adults) and beautiful Star (J46) here breaching. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

7:50 p.m. - Some of J-pod
came back up north this evening. Around
7:50 pm I saw dorsals going by my house, northbound. Dashed out, saw them again
north of Harrington Lagoon
, but lost them - and it was getting pretty dark too. Just now checking my few photos and see J-34 Doublestuf, J28 Polaris with J54 and 3 other whales. So exciting, maybe we'll have them 3 days in a row? -Jill Hein

can see major splashing from
orcas
!! Look to be on

several miles, hard to tell direction just see lots of splashing. And blows !! This from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson
*

7:40 a.m - Large pod (including 2 large males) feeding 1 mile south of Clinton ferry
. Circling for last half hour. There were 2 big fins and a fair number on real small ones. They were feeding off our neighbors buoy in 5o feet. Stayed a long time circling. Did see a large flash of red something on side of one larger ones....They came up as a group, similar to bubble feeding of humpbacks. Wierd action. Tail slapping in tight group. -William Couch
*
Our community near
Strawberry Point on Skagit Bay was treated to a gray whale visit
, Sunday evening around
7PM at high tide
. Action packed excitement close to shore. STANDING ROOM ONLY! Viewing first by beach (land), then by boat (sea) a bit later; it simply never gets old & something new to learn. Observing, for the first time a zig zag route/pattern feeding near shore. Angling out to deeper water then angling back into shallow water to feed as gray headed southwest towards Polnell Pt at sunset. Large rocks stick out at low tide/under water at high. Practical explanation on zig zagging? Gray just maneuvering to avoid the large rocks under water. Best guess :-) -Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor
*

4:22 p.m. - north Puget Sound - Gray just north of the dock at Kayak Point in Port Susan
. -Nate Trujillo
*
Around 3
:30 PM - south Puget Sound a whale went cruising by in front of my house on Glen Acres rd. Vashon
. It was heading South. I tried to take a picture, but it looks more like the Loch Ness monster than a whale. It was very close to shore, must have only been in about 20' of water. (from description sounds like emaciated juvenile gray that has been in the sound for several weeks). -Brent Thompson
*

12:30 p.m. - Grey whale again hugging Vashon heading South toward Dilworth
. Rolling and pec fin "waving". Just now! -Jan Kubat Staehli
