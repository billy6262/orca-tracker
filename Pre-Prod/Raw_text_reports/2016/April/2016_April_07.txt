Orca Sightings for April 7, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we encountered the
J17s & J22s off the NW side of Whidbey Island
, where they have continued steadily
southbound all day
. They were just slowly traveling along, and we got some beautiful looks at the newest babies
J53 & J54
,
3 generations! J17 mama/grandma, J53 youngest baby, J28 daughter, J54 grandson
. First day on the water in 2016 with orcas and it was warm, beautiful, and we were the only boat out there for an hour! What a treat. -Rachel Haight
*

7:53 p.m. - Orcas right outside Shilshole!
A bunch of them! Babies, one big male. I don't know which pod. Amazing! They were on the move. We stopped our engine and they just moved fast going south. -Donna Krell
*

7:19 p.m. - Large pod of Orcas just abeam of Jeff Head
headed South in the south bound shipping lanes. Looked to be
10 to 15 whales in pod
. - Vicky Turner

7:19 p.m. - Just saw a pod of orcas from Richmond Beach area heading south
. -Kent Bratt
*

7:03 p.m. -
... Then a couple hours later we saw a large and fast south-traveling pod o
f Orcas off of Edmonds
(also from the air.) Great day for the medical crew of Airlift 6! Here are some of the Orcas. Shot in the evening from about 600 feet altitude with a iPhone 6. -Dawn Bustanoby
*

7:00 p.m. - 9-18 orcas seen from Innes Arden (Shoreline)
best guess about
3 or more miles off Richmond beach park
. Hard to tell exactly how many at this distance but lots of spouting and breaching. -Jared Mitts
*

6:00 p.m. - pod of Orcas, Mid channel Point Wells.
They were frolicking around staying in the same place. -Steven Long

. -Rachel Haight

I was with Jill at
Ft. Casey/Lighthouse around 3 and saw them there
, then down to
Lagoon Pt around
3:30
....they were pretty far out, but visible. Decent look at them at Ft. Casey. -Bonnie Gretz

3:30 p.m. - Whales off Lagoon Point, still southbound
, mid channel. -Jill Hein
*

2:49 p.m. - We found orcas (Ts)
at Sierra Delta on the redhead
going south at 6 kts around 145 should be off Point No Point
. Also
J pod near keystone southbound
as well right now. -Trevor Tillman
*

1:26 p.m. - The orcas passed inside the Pt. Partridge Buoy
(meaning fairly close in to shore and visible with binocs) and they are now about to move parallel to shore
along Ft. Ebey State Park
. The Prince of Whales (from Canada) is leaving a big roostertail in a rush to catch up with the orcas, and one other tour boat is in front of them. If you go looking, look for the party boats. There is one male and two females, and it looks like two juveniles, total of five.

1:14 p.m. -
Island Explorer has broken off and now headed North towards Oak Harbor. The orcas are near the surface, not too far offshore (binoc range) and I count
one medium sized male, two females and probably two juveniles, maybe fairly small juveniles, total of five in this group
. Still
heading slowly southerly and still North of Pt. Partridge buoy
.

1:03 p.m. -
it was already a nice day. Now, it's a nice day with
Orcas
in the back yard. Island Explorer tour boat is drifting off our bluff following a small pod of
3-5 orcas headed
slowly South toward the Pt. Partridge Buoy. -Cameron Chandler
*

1:05 p.m. -
Got eyes on them-
mid channel off Fort Ebey
. -Michelle Booker

Gray whale under the Edmonds ferry dock but moving south, and at the same time 6 or 7 orcas celebrating and slowly headed north. This was all around

, reported by Brad Eckles, mate on the ferry Spokane.

pt no point

6:59 a.m. - From Port Townsend ferry to Whidbey Island this morning, saw probably 5 orcas
, very active. Too far away to identify. They were maybe hunting... super active with lots of breaching. Not really moving in a direction. Hard to tell from the ferry. Pretty mid channel near 2 fishing boats, just south of light house... -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn
*
Spotted an
Orca spouting and rolling
. He/she exposed tail as it dove several times.
Between Maple Cove (Langley) and Hat Island about
9:15am
this morning. Spouting and diving exposing tail as it dove. I did see a dorsal fin. -Lisa Farrell

6:24 p.m. - south Puget Sound
. Report from a dock worker of a wayward gray whale 'swimming circles' at the end of the Foss Waterway in Tacoma. -Durand Dace
*

3:00 p.m. - south Puget Sound. Grey whale frolicking in the Foss (Tacoma)
today. -Edward Holt
*

7:07 p.m. - north Puget Sound -
I'm next to Anthonys Home port at the
Everett Marina, watching up to four whale blows, maybe five
. They are off Jetty Island, yet not close enough to see what species. I can't see dorsals, but I have no binoculars. Just seeing regular blows. They are spread out, and milling around near a mid channel marker, between Camano and Jetty Island. Not much boat activity, one sail boarder closer to shore. -Laura Love Wymore
*
A report from Veronica von Allworden of
two Gray whales feeding north of Hat/Gedney Island seen around 6 pm-ish.
*

5:50 p.m. - Two blows (one grey, I think) about three hundred yards west of the Mukilteo ferry dock
! -Jessica Alexander Doyle
*

5:06 p.m. - Spotted a large group of grays (more than one group actually) in the harbor at Everett between Hat Island
and the mouth of the river
from a helicopter
late this afternoon. Then a couple hours later we saw
a large and fast south-traveling pod of Orcas off of Edmonds
(also from the air.) Great day for the medical crew of Airlift 6! Here are some of the grays. Shot in the evening from about 800 feet altitude with a LUMIX pocket camera. -Dawn Bustanoby
*

3:54 p.m. -
right in the marine dive park north of the ferry - probably one of the Gray whales?

3:30 p.m. - whale just passed really close to shore north Edmonds
.. No more than 20 yards! It heading south towards Edmonds ferry. -Stu Davdison
*

12:57 p.m. - Seeing a spout near the Clinton ferry dock
. Most likely a gray...
Actually 2
- headed south. -Lee Ann Tobin
*
A beautiful "rainblow" from
a Saratoga Gray
today taken aboard the Chilkat Express near
Clinton
.
Either 383 or 723
.-Janine Harles
*

11:00 a.m. - We saw a couple grey whales
this morning! Cascadia Research vessel was out there and confirmed
it was two boys, #383 and #723
, on the east side of Whidbey. Just as we decided had to head back to port,
J-pod was reported to be on the west side of the island
...and heading south! Scenes of a gray whale in Possession Sound today. -Jessica Alexander Doyle
*

10:18 a.m. - Pod of grays north of Mukilteo
. Moving north between Whidbey Island and Camano Island. -Tim Arnold
*

8:40 a.m. - Family of Bigg's/Transients entering Admiralty, just hours ahead of the J17s and J22s. 4 orcas sighted at Admiralty Inlet
on the Whidbey Island side and headed North One bull was sighted and I have a photo to attach for ID purposes. This was while walking
along beach of Point Wilson
. They were feeding one bull and at least 3 cows and possibly a calf. I do recall that they were heading South when I took the photo , but a little later I seem to recall that they were then heading North. -Beverly McNeil
*

7:20 p.m. - Pod of Orcas headed South, straight out from Richmond Beach in Shoreline
. They were approx. a mile or so east of Port Madison. Maybe 8 or more and at least one male. They were headed south and definitely looked like they were following a school of fish or something. Lots of surfacing and diving with a larger group out front and one or two several hundred yards back sort of taking up the rear. (the J17s & 22s)
*

1:00 p.m. - 5 or 6 Orca's traveling South, between West Beach and Smith Island
. Watched for near an hour off Bluff on West Beach and Fort Nugent Road. -Sanda Blondin
*
Two groups of Transient Orcas, the TO49A's & TO123's near James Island
. They had first been reported being spotted earlier in the day near Darcy Island from shore but had given the first boats the slip. Sidney Whale Watch picked them up near Halibut Island in the afternoon and they traveled south throughout our encounter! -Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star
*
Young gray was in the Foss Waterway in Tacoma.
I spent about an hour observing and this young whale is definitely not healthy. I'd say it was 16' - 18' feet long, max. Spine appeared very emaciated. Pretty certain this is the same one that was in the Ballard locks earlier in the week. My camera flunked out but my friend Lon Kincannon got pics. -Dean Burke
