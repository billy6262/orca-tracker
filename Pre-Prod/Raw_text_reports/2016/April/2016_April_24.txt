Orca Sightings for April 24, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today was just lovely! Caught up with the
T65As (first time this year!) T49As and T49C....These guys cruised over to Turn Point Lighthouse
on Stuart island. This is perhaps one of my most favorite places to photograph whales with backlit blows and pure green water! -Traci Walter
*
Spotted
at least 4 orcas around
12:30pm today while on the ferry from SÃ­dney, B.C to Friday Harbor
, WA. Lots of dorsal fins. Happened about 30 min into the route on the north side of the boat. -Angela Staiger
*
North Puget Sound Grays - 3 pm trip
, and we had a full load on Sound Water Stewards' fundraising cruise. We dodged the heavier rain showers and found gray whale
#723 Lucyfer just south of Hat/Gedney Island
, traveling back and forth along the shallow banks. Then to our delight,
#49 Patch
appeared to show us his very distinctive "patch" and tail fluke, what a treat! Heading north, we then found
#21 Shackelton
- the first whale to be documented in Possession Sound (by Cascadia Research Collective), way back in 1990!!.... -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea
*
Probably gray whale #44
. Couldn't confirm ID but whoever it was, was heading north from Possession when we saw him. there's also
3 others northwest of Gedney- #49, 723 and 383
were all together. -Renee Beitzel
*
Spouting spotted @
12:15pm Clinton going to Mukilteo ferry crossing
...spouting spotted to the north of the ferry. (No dorsal fins seen, so guessing not orcas.) -Jeff Reoch
*

5:45 p.m. -
Today while sailing we thought we changed our course a bit to avoid a log or rock and were pretty surprised to find that when we passed it was actually
a grey whale
. We were concerned because it didn't appear to be moving aside from a little bobbing with the water, which was quite calm.
Southwest of Kingston
pretty close to shore, at about 47.772214,-122.469870. We had it in sight for only about 5 minutes. -Caitlin Gibson
*

5:07 p.m. - There is a whale between Jefferson Head and Kingston
floating on the surface moving very slowly. At first we thought he was dead, but he appears to be alive. I'm a newbie at this so not sure what else to report. -Nancy Langwith
