Orca Sightings for April 5, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Samantha Pierce of Camano Island called in a report at

1:50 pm, of a whale in Port Susan
, near the Country Club area, facing east and feeding in the same spot for quite some time. (From her description and the location, definitely sounds like
one of our Saratoga Gray whales
feeding in Port Susan. - SB)
