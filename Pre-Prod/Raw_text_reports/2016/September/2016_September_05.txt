Orca Sightings for September 5, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Georgia Strait -
A great encounter today with
Bigg's Killer Whales! T19 and T19C finally caught up with T18 and T19B
after being separated for most of the day by two very long islands. T19 and T19C were vocalizing the whole day trying to find T18 and T19B and finally tracked them down in the Georgia Strait after 20 miles of searching and almost a whole day apart. Once they were in acoustic range
T19 and T19C high speed porpoised for 8 miles to meet up with T18 and T19B
. We could hear both groups calling back and forth on the hydrophone when they were two miles apart. Super cool encounter! -Simon Pidcock, Ocean EcoVentures WW
