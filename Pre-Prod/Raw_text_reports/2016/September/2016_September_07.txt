Received a report from Don Bower from Sept. 7, about

1:30, of 8-10 orcas just outside Makah Bay, about a 1/2 mile off Cape Flattery
. He said there were two adult males and three juveniles, splashing as they headed NE toward Vancouver Island. Unidentified Atlantic killer whales
*

3:00 p.m. - EDT pod of orcas playing seen from shore at Assateague, VA
. At the beach in Assateague Park, VA was standing on a small berm and saw what I first thought were surfers in black wetsuits UNTIL I saw their
black dorsal fins
! Then they began breaching the surface and I clearly saw the
white ventral surfaces
...OMG it was breathtaking. There were
approximately six fins
(that I could see from shore) lots of blowhole activity and after about ten minutes they swam away. They were a majestic sight and I felt privileged to see this. Few beachgoers were paying attention as it was right after Tropical Storm Hermine. No photos - they looked like orcas. I saw black fins on all of them. feeding and playing. -Liz Omps
