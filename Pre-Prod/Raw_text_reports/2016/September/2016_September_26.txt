Yes another glorious calm, sunny day for Mystic Sea's scenic trip through the San Juan islands to Salmon Bank, where a plethora of sea-birds gathered to feed on nature's bounty. Not only sea-birds but seals and
Minke whales
(smallest of the baleen whales) kept passengers intrigued with their appearances and disappearances as they made a number of directional changes. It's not often we are fortunate to see the beautiful tapered head of the Minke whale, but today's lunge-feeding provided that golden opportunity. Cruising on to
Smith and Minor Islands we spotted another Minke
, which has sustained wounds in front of, and on, the dorsal fin. Hopefully these wounds will heal with time... Growling Steller sea-lions jostling for a place on Whale Rocks greeted us as we sailed past their haul-out, giving it large with attitude! -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
