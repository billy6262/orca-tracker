4:00p.m. trip to Active Pass with some residents
. (which included the J16s and J2 Granny and L87 Onyx) -Capt. Jim Maya

Great day with resident orcas. This is
K13 Skagit spyhopping in Swanson Channel
with her daughter,
K27 Deadhead
and grandson,
K44 Ripple
in the background. K37 Rainshadow surfacing near False Bay on San Juan Island from Saturday morning. Rainshadow was born in 2003. He is at an age where he will start going through a noticeable growth spurt. His dorsal fin will begin to sprout and grow taller, his pectoral flippers will increase in size, and his tail will begin to curl on the ends. All apart of growing up and enduring the gawky teenage years! It will be very fun watching Rainshadow grow over the next 10 years. -Katie Jones

Js & Ks up west side of SJI - saw J2 and K13s
for sure. The groups were widely spread & most crossed into Canada by 3pm. Also heard reports of some Ls around Eagle Pt, but did not get to see them. Hope they stuck around today! -Michelle Leann

L92 Crewser passing by Lime Kiln lighthouse
. Members of all 3 pods were there. -Breanna Elsea Cena

Dreams do come true, I have always wanted to see whales in their natural environment. Rented a Skiff from Van Riper's Resort in
Clallam Bay, Seiku, Washington. We saw a Orca and several Humpbacks
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Ian-Laura Coyle
