Orca Sightings for September 6, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
...Although the resident orca used to come all of the way into the Salish Sea in large groups with complete pods, they now typically spread out over a large expanse of water by the time they pass by Race Rocks. I surmise this spread is due to a spread or low density of prey (Chinook salmon) in recent years as compared to decades ago. After all, there were 1.5 to 1.9 million Chinook salmon caught per year by humans (WDF Technical Report No. 76, 1983) from stocks utilizing the Strait of Juan de Fuca in those early years of Orca Survey, and the average fish was 15-17.5 pounds;... -Center for Whale Research staff CWR encounter 95

Great to see a "Super Pod"
J, K, & L of the Southern Resident Killer Whales off Sooke, BC
today. Feeding, mating, and highly energetic this afternoon! -Paul Pudwell
*
WOW! Super Pod of Southern Resident Killer Whales coming east past Sheringham Lighthouse this morning! We also had a super "POD" of
60+ Humpback whales
just south of the same area... WOW! This might be the most epic total whale sightings we have ever seen around Sooke, BC. -Paul Pudwell

Incredible night with the
T60s
. They were continually on the hunt and made several kills. That didn't stop when they reached
Colville Island (SE of Orcas Island) where T60, T60E, and T60F
entered the small cove/crack on the southeast side of the island. I didn't even realize a whale could fit in there, let alone three! ...light was fading, but it was so cool to watch T60E face off with two seals, have mom come out of the cove and appear to push her kiddo (who was probably blocking the entrance), and then moments later the youngest zoomed out of the cove as well and followed her mom and older sibling off to check out other seals hauled out nearby. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

3:55 p.m. - Just left 4 (maybe 5) orca headed due south in Griffin Bay between San Juan and Lopez Islands
toward Cattle Pass. Easy to find as 6 whale watching boats are traveling with them. -Deb Varner
*
Encounter with a pod of
about 4 Orcas in West sound around 1pm
. We were very far away watching thorough binoculars with engine off and they eventually swam past us. -Kimberly Lynn Wickens
*

10:00 a.m. -
Maia of WSF called to relay a report of
6-8 orcas in San Juan Channel
. No directions given.
*
Admiralty Inlet - T34s, T36s, T37s, T65As, T99s - Early morning
reports had orcas
northbound
in Puget Sound. Approx.

10:00 am
we first caught sight of three lovely groups spread loosely gliding along in the calm waters of morning.
T65As just north of Point No Point and the two larger groups surfaced more inshore
. Their northbound travels continued, mostly just in travel mode, surfacing in regular intervals then longish dives, every once in a while staying down for 6-7 minutes or longer. The T65As most of the time hung to the outside to themselves. At one point a large group surfaced after a very long dive heading for shore in a line...it was breathtaking. This directional change and movement had every look to be pod on the hunt, but that did not happen. That group then cruised well inshore as others stayed more offshore in the lead. No kill was witnessed in my time on scene. Watching so many fins surface at once so tightly clustered in their home waters pierces ones soul. We left for a time and returned to find them again further north. We left them still northbound off
north end of Marrowstone around
12:55 p.m
, left superpod of Ts (including T37s, T65As, T99s) in couple of groups powering northbound nearing Fort Flagler, very much Flagler side of Admiralty.. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

1:30 pm - the orcas passed Point Wilson Lighthouseas they continued north
before disappearing into the fog. -Sandra Pollard

Just spotted a
fairly large pod of orcas north of East Beach park, Marrowstone island, heading north
. Edmonds whale watch following behind. -Heather Lapmeier Cramer
*

10:44 a.m. - viewing from south Mutiny Bay
, whales look to be headed straight west, slightly northerly, from my line of sight looks like they're aiming for Foulweather bluff. -Rachel Haight
*

10:37 a.m. -
Dave Anderson called to say he was seeing
orcas across Admiralty Inlet near Foulweather Bluff
.
*

10:30 a.m. -
They commited to Admiralty.
First in 3 groups loosley spread with T65As further east. Now in two large groups either side of mid channel northbound out from Double Bluff, Whidbey side and Skunk Bay, Kitsap side

10-15 orcas just southeast of Point No Point, heading north or east

Saw them just
North of Kingston on the

8:00 a.m. -
Tony Woelke from WS ferries called from the Puyallup and reports
6-8 orcas (including 1 male, couple of females, and young) first southbound, then northbound 1/2 mile off and south of Apple Cove Point, Kingston
. Surface activity and some directional changes, not looking to be going anywhere.
*

7:16 a.m. -
I just woke up to the sound of whales swimming by! Orcas
heading north toward Kingston passing by President Point
. Maybe eight or so disappeared in the mist. -Julia Milller

1:35 p.m. -
Unidentified whales -
A dark grey or black whale
just passed the North end of the
Bangor Base
(Hood Canal) at the old de-gassing dock. He was going South. Was swimming right into an area with about 30 or more crab pots. He didn't breach high enough so I could see his entire body. Not certain. He didn't breach high enough. Could see that he was dark grey or black. It was a small curved dorsal. The color wasn't as black and shiny as an orca. It appeared dark gray. In fact, it looked more like a pseudorca than any of the other pictures on your site. It was probably about 1/8 mile away and I looked through my high-powered scope and saw it surface about 4 times, but it was fast and I couldn't see as much as I would have liked. -Carole Baker
