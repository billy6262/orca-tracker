Orca Sightings for September 22, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Late in the day on
September 22nd, the
Js and Ks we saw go north on the 21st were making their way back down
. First came the
K12s and K13s
in the late afternoon passing the west side in harsh sun glare. By the time the others made it down a couple hours later, the sun was already low in the sky. (More photos and encounter reports Sept 18-22nd at Orca Watcher Blog). -Monika Wieland Shields

2:35 p.m. -
My sister, Wendy Sines, is seeing
orcas and boats south of Lime Kiln
, I think she's at one of the Land bank pullouts. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

1:51 p.m. -
fins in the upper part of the web cam. And, all is quiet...no other noises except for the periodic vocals!

hydro. -Kim Merriman

Certainly 5, perhaps 6 or 7, killer whales were off of Bullman Beach (western Juan de Fuca - east of Neah Bay)
this afternoon
between
3:50 and
4:50 pm
, the date being 9-22-16. Playing and feeding, again in the kelp, near what we call Rat Rock, directly off our beach, east of Sail and Seal...There was also one or two grays in the area. The grays don't seem to be showing up for us in their typical numbers this year. I have had a hunch that others here left in the past week and a half to follow the humpbacks. Could that be so?... -Maureen
*

5:00 p.m. - a single humpback headed south from Dana Passage - south Puget Sound
, closer to the eastern shore passing Boston Harbor, Cooper Point and into Budd Inlet where I lost sight of it. It was moving very rapidly and surfaced heartily approx. 8 times (between Boston Harbor and the entrance to Budd Inlet) before it swam out of sight. Cascadia Research knows. -Kim Merriman

4:38 p.m. -
Saw
large whale in south sound (Devils Head) moving north toward Johnson Point
. (west side of reach). Large - could be
Humpback

12:38 p.m. - Spotted probably the same humpback as Jake headed north between Fort Ebey and Port Townsend - Admiralty Inlet
just a minute ago! -Erin Graf
