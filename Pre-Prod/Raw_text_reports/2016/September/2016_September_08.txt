Orca Sightings for September 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
It might have been a true Super Pod, cuz right at the end of the trip, along comes the
L11s (L12s) and Mega, L41
. Sunsetting at
Race Rocks, BC
. -Capt. Jim Maya

The leading group of
Southern Residents, streaming out to Hein Bank from San Juan Island
. A spread out "super pod" was reported, with small groups of all three pods moving quickly. We caught up with
K35 Sonata, K33 Tika, K21 Cappuccino, K44 Ripple, L47 Ripple and her daughter L91 Muncher, with her calf L-122
. They were actively fishing at times, with some playful breaches, spy hops, and tail slaps. After spending some beautiful time with them, we headed east toward home, stopping to see the imposing Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks, and enjoying a trip through the rocky islands around Lopez. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
