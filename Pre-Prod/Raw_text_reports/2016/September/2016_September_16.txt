Big flocks of sea birds on the water (known as bird piles) usually means food...Today was no exception, and after passing Colville Island, where numerous Pacific Harbor seals were hauled out on the rocks, Mystic Sea headed for
Smith & Minor Islands Aquatic Reserve where we spotted a couple of Minke whales
(the smallest of the baleen whales) dipping and diving to take advantage of the rich nutritional offerings in the marine ecosystem. A Steller sea-lion showed off his catch when surfacing, and we were treated to a fleeting glimpse of two Pacific White-Sided Dolphins (also known as Lags) as well as Harbor porpoises, the smallest of the cetaceans we see here. The season may be drawing to a close, but every trip offers something different and no two days are ever the same. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
