Orca Sightings for September 25, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Once the
K16s
were identified, "Orcinus" headed north and, ten minutes later, found more
spread out whales in Swanson Channel
around
1030. J46 and J54
were foraging together mid-channel and looked like they might have been either chasing a salmon or sharing one.
J44
moved north past this pair while they were foraging. J54 still looks too thin for his age but it was encouraging to see him try to catch fish with his older sister. -See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 103.

The oldest male in all 3 pods,
Mega (L41)
in all his beauty kelping in Active Pass. The
L12s traveled through Active Pass today
, currently not a usual route for this family. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Windsong (L121), Calypso (L94), and Ocean Sun (L25), Mega (L41), Joy (L119), Spirit (L22) and Matia (L77)
. Sunday we were privileged enough to watch the
L12s go through Active Pass
. It was incredible! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
It has been well over a year since I have had a good encounter with the
L12s, L77 "Matia" L94 "Calypso", L121 "Windsong", L25 "Ocean Sun", L41 "Mega" kelping beside L121 "Windsong"
. We so rarely get to see them up in our neck of the woods anymore so (Sept 25) was pretty awesome getting to watch them
come through Active Pass behind J pod, J27 "Blackberry", J34 "DoubleStuf", J17 "Princess Angeline" and J53 "Kiki"
. -Gary Sutton

Summer may be officially over, but it didn't seem that way today as Mystic Sea cruised through glassy seas and warm sunshine to Salmon Bank near San Juan Island. Here we encountered
members of K and L pod whales
from the endangered Southern Resident community, including
Scoter (K-25), his sister Spock (K-20), Racer (L72) and her 'sprouter' son Fluke (L-105)
, traveling within close proximity to one another as they searched for their traditional food, Chinook salmon. Hopefully the energized breaches and vigorous tail-slapping we saw mean they are finding enough of those energy bars before they begin their forays into Puget Sound in the fall in search of Chum salmon. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

3:44 p.m. - Calls on OrcaSound hydrophone
. -Monika Wieland Shields
*
Js and some Ks in Boundary, K12s and K14s foraging north and south of Lime Kiln
, others still off sound end as of
1045
. We had K12s foraging off Lime Kiln from 10-1, K14s north, Ls south. All spread foraging not going anywhere pretty much. K12s were still off LK when we left. Only other whale I saw was L92 off Land Bank but then he went back south, as we left looked like boats between False Bay and Eagle as well. -Monika Wieland Shields
*

1:21 p.m. - They're still echolocating
.

12:15 - Lots of echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. And it's quiet (ship wise) as well. Very cool! -Kim Merriman
*

12:35 p.m. - Loud calls and grunts
. Geez.. from about
12:35 to around
1:00 they made all kinds of cool sounds and calls. Hope that's them celebrating catching some fish! -Melissa Burke
*

12:25 p.m. - I am hearing Ks loud and clear
as I type. Beautiful fall day to be out there I can only imagine

10:58 a.m. - fairly loud S16 or S17 K calls
.

10:45 a.m. - more intermittent calls, sounds like K calls
.

10:37 a.m. - turned on Lime Kiln, hearing faint calls
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

We were the first and only to find the sometimes elusive
L54 matriline, with L88 Wavewalker
, another lone male who who lost his mother and brother both in 2012. He now travels with of the
Southern Resident Killer Whales today just west of Sooke
, B.C. Vancouver Island. -Paul Pudwell
*

5:54 a.m. - Orcas on Lime Kiln hyrdophone
. -Ursual Renteria

I reached the
eastern shore of Puget Sound off north Edmonds
just shy of sunset to watch this
humpback
who primarily was engaged in some excellent pec (pectoral fin) slapping most of the time I was viewing her/him. One breach, a few long dives, and more pec slapping then the whale was off,
northbound entering Possession Sound aiming towards Clinton/Mukilteo
in the waning light. Here's a peek at the pecs. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

6:55 p.m. -
Another dive, this one about 7 minutes. Surfaced now heading steadily northbound towards
Mukilteo/Clinton
. Still south end of Possession Sound. Thats where I leave her/him. Sweet.

6:39 p.m. -
This looks like a young whale. S/he is pec slappin her/his way north. I got here in time to see one breach in between repetition of dives and pec slapping. Currently on a dive between north Edmonds and Possession Point.

6:24 p.m. - humpback is off north Edmonds
pec slapping! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

6:23pm humpback repeatedly breaching north sound
- line of sight
between north Edmonds and Scatchet head
- it's heading north to the east side of Whidbey island . Will post videos of breaches and side flukes slaps. Very active
Humpback Whale passing Edmonds
Washington this evening slowly heading northbound. Long distance videoing from North Edmonds shoreline looking west over north Puget Sound. -Stu Davidson
*
I watched two or more
humpback whales off Edmonds
last night 9/25/16 for 30 minutes. At

5:50
they were opposite the ferry dock, going north. They breached frequently. Without binoculars I watched them continue toward Double Bluff on Whidbey Island. Seen until
6:20. -Ron Hebron
*
Received a call from Vicky Hone Smith at

5:50 pm, reporting a Humpback whale off Edmonds
. Vicky was off Pt. Edward looking out across the marina. They had been watching it awhile, seeing blows and one pec fin slapping the water, it was logging on the surface and not diving or traveling and they were concerned it might be entangled or in distress. As we were talking, it breached, then again, and again! It seemed to be moving NE, and perhaps was just resting or doing pec slaps.
*

5:45 p.m. - Humpbacks off Edmonds.
-Elyse Sollito
*

2:50 p.m. - We just saw a whale in Elliot Bay
, not sure what type. Feeling blown away and super lucky! I first saw it between W Seattle and Myrtle Edwards. Since then, we've seen the spray as the whale heads west. -Chelsea Myers
*
Watching from
West Seattle just saw spray. Just at the tip of Vashon.
12:35 pm
. Going North. -Dana Sheppard
*
At about

11:45 AM
on 9/25/16 -
Humpback whale in Colvos Passage
! We saw a single, small humpback whale traveling about 40 ft offshore moving north. We were eating breakfast by the water and heard it breath and it was right there! We saw it surface 3 times until it was out of sight. -Julie Jacobsen
*

11:33 a.m. -
One whale sighting,
Sunset Beach on Colvos
! So close to Vashon shore, maybe 300' out! -Kristy Hegnauer
*

11:21..
there may still be something
off Ruston, by the Tacoma Yacht Club
and the Grain Ship "Tiger Lilly". I saw something dive about 20 minutes ago, haven't seen it since. Could be on the other side of the ship though (on Vashon side) I didn't hear it breathe however, and I'm fairly confident I would hear it, it's pretty quiet out here, can hear music from the boats pasding. -Melissa Burke
*

10:34 a.m. - Mid channel of Colvos Passage
having just entered from
Narrows/Point Defiance
. Seeing it with binoculars from Pt. Defiance. -Ryan Rooks

10:10 a.m. - Heading up Colvos Passage.

10:02 a.m. - Pretty much at the tip of Point Defiance
now still heading north. -Lisa Durbin Charbonneau

just passed by Salmon Beach in Tacoma traveling north. -Zeno Martin
