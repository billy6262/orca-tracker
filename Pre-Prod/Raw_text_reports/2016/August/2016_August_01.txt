Orca Sightings for August 1, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:20ish
- I just met someone who saw the whale go by
North point of Harstine Island
. Just missed it! -Connor O'Brien
*

06:50 PM - My folks just saw a whale heading north in Pickering Passage north of Harstine Island bridge
. They heard it twice, thought there were two, then saw a big grey back roll out. No clear id but thought someone around the way might get one if they know to look out. No photos. We heard 1 breathing noise and then a 2d and we saw a whale body but could not identify it. It did not look like an orca or a pilot whale. We watched for a 3d breaching but did not see one. We heard what might have been a 3d breathing breech but did not see it. -Carl and Carol Hauge
*

4:00 p.m. -Fin whale headed south passing Boston Harbor into Budd Inlet.
Turned around and headed north toward Squaxin. Turned around again and headed south down Eld Inlet. It zig zagged from one side of the shoreline to the other.
5:00 it headed north out of Eld Inlet where I lost sight. -Kim Merriman

Here's the whale I saw off
Steilacoom
. Unfortunately, temperature distortion and my shaking from excitement makes this not the greatest pic, but it was incredible to see! -JJ Davern

10:23 a.m. -
Cathy Baker reports seeing the
Fin whale
(Long back. Small fin way back. Not a hump) surface near
Point Ruston, Tacoma

*

8:40 a.m. - Puget Sound -
Stephanie Raymond on the San Juan Clipper, reports
one or possibly two Humpbacks, 1 mile south of the Clinton ferry dock
(South Whidbey Island) southbound at a fast pace.

Juan de Fuca -
It was a long slog through the islands in fog today, but as gray skies gave way to blue intrepid whale watchers were rewarded for their patience by an engaging encounter with
a humpback whale near Port Angeles
. This whale was intrigued by our presence, so with engines cut we rolled around in the swell inhaling the 'sweet' smell of whale breath as the whale surfaced nearby, surprising passengers by exhaling a plume of rainbow colored vapor from two blowholes (the humpback is a baleen/rorqual whale). Not too many good photos on this trip due to boat movement, and sometimes it's fun to simply enjoy the moment in the presence of these magnificent creatures. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

Today, the morning tour out of Anacortes with Island Adventures was lucky enough to encounter
a very curious female humpback.
We spent about 30 minutes with her and she gave us 3 encounters where she explored the boat, rolled over and gave us belly, sprayed us, and really checked us out. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had! Also hilarious because I had to abandon my 600mm lens fitter my iPhone to get the shots. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

Gray Whale this morning
just off the coast of
Point Roberts
. Turned and headed back out toward White Rock. -Justin Schultz
*
My boyfriend and I were sitting on the shore near the
Des Moines Marina
looking into the Puget Sound, we both saw
a whale's tail
in the water. We kept an eye out to see it again and then to our surprise it surfaced and breached. We aren't completely sure whether it was an orca or other whale but it was shocking to see it so close to the shore an in an enclosed area of the Sound. Very awesome experience! -Natasha Polupan

I saw the them (
Common dolphins) at Narrows Viewpoint on Point Defiance Five Mile Loop at
8:30 pm
. They were travelling south towards the bridge. At least 8 of them. -Meghan Davis-Van Horn
*
I got to see the
common Dolphins in Steilacoom
. We saw them around
2pm
traveling north towards the Tacoma Narrows. I've read a lot that says there are only 2 or 3 of them but there were more than that. There were at least four. -Jennifer Concoby
