Orca Sightings for August 27, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Juan de Fuca -
We had a great group today that braved the excitement of nautical seas and had the pleasure of visiting
4 Humpbacks and some regular Transient / Biggs Whales T011 & T011A arund Sooke
waters today...Good Times! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW
*
Patos Island area - We found
a humpback whale at at Patos Island
and watched closely for around 45 minutes as it swam and showed us its fluke. We then continued on to East Point where we observed
a group of transient orcas
for a bit before starting our return venture home. -Amy W.. Mystic Sea

2:35 p.m. - Puget Sound -
I think the group may have split while we were
watching them from Mutiny Sands at
11:15 am
. After spotting 'the tight group of
8-10 powering north
', it looked as though some pulled off west while 2-3 slowed up and seemed to be moving towards Whidbey Island, but then headed north again. We went on to
Bush Point and continued to watch this group
as they approached Marrowstone. Now sounds as if the group that may have pulled off west have made a later appearance off Bush Point and have become 'the trailers'. -Sandra Pollard
*
Now nodule
Pt Marrowstone side still north bound but only 4 animals
, 2 males and 2 females,
T18 and T19s
. -Christopher Hanke
*

12:45 p.m. - Orca sighting just off Marrowstone Island
. my girlfriend and I were sailing in the Admiralty inlet heading south east toward Port Ludlow and we happened upon
two Male orcas
that were travelling northwest toward port Townsend. We were just off
Liplip Point Marrowstone island
. We captured a short video which is attached to this email. We suppose they were two males because the fins were extremely large! We first noticed them due to the breathing and then saw the fins. We turned north and could see them surfacing for another 20 min or so. -Chris Rosenthal and Casey Herron
*

2:36 p.m. - Watching them right now from Fort Casey
. They're pretty close to shore on the Whidbey side headed North. We could see them from Frank Robinson beach, but they were pretty far out from the bay. -Melissa Gail Banks
*
At
2 pm
, Greg Davis called to report
four or more orcas off the north end of Marrowstone
, continuing NW out of Admiralty Inlet. This is probably the first group...
*
Pat Scott called at

1:50 pm to report a pod of 6 orcas
, no males,
passing Bush Pt
. heading NW.
*

12:57 p.m. -
Just now, seeing blows and fins from
Lagoon Point
but far on other side. Still a little south of Lagoon Point. -Patricia Prochaska
*

12:14 p.m. -
Just now
approaching Bush Pt
, watched them pass here, south of Bush Pt, close to the Whidbey side. Saw
2 males, a female and juvenile
for sure. Traveling NW up Admiralty Inlet at a pretty good pace, looked like maybe a stop for a kill or hunt. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

11:42 a.m. - Off Mutiny Bay
. Going North. Slowly. -Helen Shamek
*

11:12 a.m. - Tight group of 8-10 powering north off Mutiny Bay
, Whidbey Island. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

10:00 a.m. - About ten orcas
were reported by Gary Stubbs from
Maxwelton Beach
, Whidbey Island, heading north roughly mid-channel but more on the Whidbey side.
*
It was a tough day today with no orcas in the general area and weather and high seas prohibiting access to other areas. While searching for transient orcas around seal haul-outs, we found a
10-year-old humpback whale known as "Split Fin" BCZ0298
, born in 2006 to "Big Mama" BCY0324, near
Patos Island
. Split Fin was on 7-8 minute dive intervals searching for krill and small fish. -Brendon Bissonnette
