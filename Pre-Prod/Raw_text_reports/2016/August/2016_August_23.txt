Orca Sightings for August 23, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the early morning there were reports of
many southern resident killer whales up near the Coal Docks at Tsawassen
, and they gradually moved down
toward Point Roberts
as the morning progressed. Ken was in Port Angeles arranging for a boat house for keeping a vessel on the Olympic Peninsula for autumn encounters with the whales when they typically shift to a diet that includes Chum salmon (
Oncorhynchus keta
) headed for spawning in Puget Sound rivers. There do not seem to be enough King salmon (
O. tshawytscha
) this year headed for spawning in Salish Sea rivers, particularly the Fraser, to entice all of the SRKWs to come into the region or stay very long, so maybe we will get a chance to get a comprehensive Orca Survey later this year. Readers of our encounter summaries should also keep up with status of eastern pacific stocks of salmon and fishery management in this classic predator/prey drama. We will refer to this subject in special reports, news articles and blogs as time goes on...-Center for Whale Research Encounter 88

Watched
Ks & Ls pass Lime Kiln State
park just before and after sunset and then watched a few of the trailers including
L82
and
L116
foraging out from
Land Bank
into near darkness. Turned on the hydrophones and listened
Js
who were trailing and approaching the lighthouse...then wandered down to the rocks at Land Bank to listen to them pass in the darkness. Listened to their blows in the dark
until approx
9:20pm
from the rocks as they steadily moved southbound down island. -Alisa, Orca Network

A STUNNING afternoon encounter. Orcas surfing a huge freighter wake and
Onyx
doing multiple breaches?! Yes, please! After a huge freighter wake rolled by, this big fellow became quite spunky. He cartwheeled, breached three times, and ended things with a slow spyhop for good measure. I've known Onyx for 16 years and over that time I have had many amazing, incredible, and at times heartbreaking encounters with him. He is truly an amazing character. What a privilege to share space with such a special creature...-Katie Jones

The guy on the beach says, "you're welcome!" There was
a second humpback traveling North
not too long after which we saw from a higher point just up the trail from
Deadman's Bay, San Juan Is.
, a bit further out. Also, loved seeing those blackfish heading South at sunset! Wow! -Joel Brazle

Humpback norhtbound in Haro Strait! From

3:45-
4:05 pm watched the humpback from Deadman's Bay
(south Lime Kiln Park, San Juan Island) make her/his way northbound at a steady pace. Regular surfacing and fluking pattern with 2-5 minutes dives. Drove up to County Park a while later just as s/he was passing the park. We watched
from about
