Orca Sightings for August 12, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:00 p.m. - East Point, Saturna Island: K20, part of a relatively large resident pod heading east
. -James McLarnon
*
WOW! AN AMAZING afternoon with our
Southern Resident Killer Whales passing Sooke! J, K & L Pods were present
, but the action packed excitement was off the charts!
K16s and K21
(ID's by Alisa Lemire Brooks & Sara Hysong-Shimazu)
heading east past Race Rocks Ecological Preserve. I am happy to get one breach shot on a good day, but this was extra SPECIAL! -Paul Pudwell
*
Nice evening with
L Pod, and some Js and Ks - Juan de Fuca Strait
. And the Olympic Mountains! And a nice sunset! -Capt. Jim Maya
*
K25 off Saturn Island this afternoon.
-Sara Baldwin

With the welcome return of
K pod
(the endangered Southern Resident orca population is made up of three pods, J, K and L, totaling 83 in number) to our local waters, Mystic Sea headed past Lopez Island and along the west side of San Juan Island and Lime Kiln State Park (also known as Whale Watch Park) towards Stuart Island, where we encountered
K pod whales, including K22 (Sekiu) and her son K33 (Tika)
, a 'sprouter' male born in 2001, passing Turnpoint Lighthouse. With the whales in traveling mode, we witnessed a number of energetic breaches and tail-slaps as they hunted for salmon, though a mature bald eagle deprived them of one tasty morsel and enjoyed a substantial lunch on the nearby rocks. We left the whales heading towards Saturna Island, B.C., and continued on our scenic trip back to Anacortes passing between Shaw and Orcas Islands on yet another truly glorious Pacific Northwest day. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

After being gone for nearly two months (!!), it's been awesome to have
members of K-Pod around again
over the last week, and very interesting to see how they're splitting up and mixing and matching with J-Pod in ways that are different from last summer.
K12 Sequim and K43 Saturna were off Spieden Island this afternoon. We had K12s and K13s from Open Bay to Boundary Pass heading north from
12:30 til
2:15
. -Monika Wieland
*
Calls at Lime Kiln. Slowly getting louder. Started
3:15 am
PST. -Ali Barratt
*
T10`s - Juan de Fuca - 4 minutes from our docks in Sooke Harbor
this afternoon. Then we heard of INBOUND Southern Resident killer whales! -Paul Pudwell
*
Transient pod T069 4 miles offshore Cleland Island (Tofino)
slowly heading south east. Beat up a sea otter and killed something (presumed harbour porpoise) and celebrated afterward. Looks like one of the females had a new calf. Not the matriarch's calf. -Shaun Parniak

Humpback whale surfaces in south Puget Sound near Day Island
. -Danyell Laughlin

Saw whale
in Puget Sound on west side of Fox Island
. (confirmed now as
humpback
via video not shared here. -Janet Roethier
*

9:19 p.m. - Sounding again close to the Southworth Dock
.

9:10 p.m. - Humpback whale between Peter Point and Southworth
right now, sounding 5 times so far, on Kitsap side. -Fiona Hope
*

8:30 p.m. - We are on Vashon island, just across from Ollala. We just watched a humpback whale
pass from the south to the north over the course of the last 15 minutes. It would come up and blow its spout every 1 - 2 minutes and cover about 100 yards before surfacing again. -Jeff Sayre
*

8:25 p.m. - humpback
is mid channel still northbound up Colvos at a steady pace, passing Fragaria road now. Heading towards Southworth. -Brittany Gordon
*

7:30 p.m. - humpback whale heading north in Colvos Passage
. South of Lisabuela. -Roxane Jackson Johnson
*

7:16 p.m. -
Just saw several sprays and what could be
two whales heading north up the Gig Harbor side off Point Defiance
. they were heading north between Gig Harbor and Vashon. Too far away to tell what type of whale. -Kelli Barker
*

6:30 p.m. -
We just saw what we believe is
a [humpback] whale heading north under the Narrows Bridge
and currently at Salmon Beach. It was too far away to know for sure but there were no showings of fluke so I think it's a gray. Traveling fast. (
was a humpback- ALB
), -Susan Dynes
*
(Humpback probably?) whale at Chambers Bay at around
5:45 pm
or so on Friday. -Carrie Gelegonya
*
We were at the
Beach at Chambers Bay
again today. At about

5:30 pm
we saw something blow out at the channel marker towards McNeil Island. We watched the whale steadily move directly towards us and then head North towards the narrows. Sadly there were two (asshats) idiots in boats following very closely. We watched it until it was so far North we could no longer see it. What a beauty. We assumed it was a
humpback
... Wonderful way to end our day...-Cindy Faker

Humpback diving near Chambers Bay - Puget Sound
. -Danyell Laughlin
*

4:05 p.m. - Just spotted a Minke Whale at the mouth of San Juan channel (west side)
. Seems to have been a juvenile and an adult! We will send a photo as soon as we can. We know for sure they weren't humpback. We sat there and observed them for 45 minutes while referencing whale guides. -Jess Whitsett
*

8:05 p.m. -
Just saw them heading south, towards the
harstine island bridge
! -Nick Wenzel
*

6:55 p.m. - Common Dolphins seen heading south off the Northeast side of Harstine Island.
These are definitely dolphins this time as they were jumping. -Connor O'Brien
