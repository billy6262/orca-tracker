Orca Sightings for August 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
A friend messaged me early this morning to tell me their were orcas in front of her house and they were heading north up the shoreline! I sprang out of bed, grabbed my gear, and off
to the lighthouse
we went. We waited eagerly for the
whales
and as they passed by us, they left us in awe. Just feet from the shore, you could see them underwater as they rolled through the kelp. Understandably, waking up in this manner is a very good way to begin the day. -Katie Jones

Great Way to Start the Day!!
Epic pass at Lime Kiln this morning
. Yes, that is the kelp and shoreline. Several whales passed just a few feet from shore. Look carefully and you will see them just under the surface.
Many members of J and K pods passed
. Life is good! J16 & J26 passed very close to the rocks at Lime Kiln State Park. -Alison Engle

Around
8 AM the first whales came into sight south of Lime Kiln
, moving slowly north against the ebb tide. From about

8:15-
8:45
J2 Granny took her time cruising by, followed by some of the K14s.
Then we had the
J11s, J14s, J16s, and J19s
pass right off the rocks in two tight groups - always an amazing sight to witness but even more so in the gorgeous early morning light when you could see them underwater! Next, further offshore, came the
K16s and K21
in a tight group, and bringing up the rear were
L87 Onyx and J45 Se-Yi-Chn
. By 10 they were all north of the lighthouse and continuing on their way up Haro Strait. -Monika Wieland, Orca Behavior Institute
*
South of Constance Bank Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Still no ID on this
humpback
. It was travelling at a fast pace with a companion.
T046's were nearby at Constance Bank
. -Janine Harles
