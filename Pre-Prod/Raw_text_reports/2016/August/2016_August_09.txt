Orca Sightings for August 9, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
They all flipped and
went back south as of
8:30 PM, angling offshore again
. I'm still wondering who was off the south end yesterday and this morning.
J2, J14s, J16s, J19s, K12s, K13s, and K14s are whales that went north yesterday and came back south today
. Not sure if the rest of Js have been down there or if some Ls are mixed in or what. I've heard a couple people say some Ls are here but no one who has actually seen them. I should add L87 was in that group that went up and back too.

7:17 p.m. -
still milling but getting farther offshore. Trending south if anything

6:50 p.m. - Milling off Land Bank
.
As of
3 PM they were all south of Hannah Heights southbound
. I was surprised to see the J16s come down from the north! -Monika Wieland
*
K14s and some of the J17s off the west side of San Juan Island in the the evening
. It's been SO nice to see
K pod
again, and such a relief to see they're all doing alright.
J34 Doublestuf northbound and the K14s were moving up the west side of San Juan Island
. -Heather MacIntyre

2:40 p.m. - At least 20 orcas are spread out near Eagle Point, San Juan Island!
We saw a group coming up from the south, about 4-5 individuals, at least 2 males. And a group of 15 or so coming down from the North, in small groups of 2-3! They met just south of Lime Kiln and are slowly west, headed out to mid channel, but still very visible from land. Lots of large males. -Kayli Ann Breitweiser

2:34 p.m -
I just left
Lime Kiln
not long ago and there were still more coming from the north. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

Upon arriving at
Eagle Point on San Juan Island, we met up with a group of our southern resident orcas
, several of which we were able to identify. Among those IDed were
J27 (Blackberry), J44 (Moby), and K21 (Cappuccino)

Looked like a mother with a juvenile. Traveling. -Colleen Boye

Three Orcas, likely a bull, cow, and older juvenile sighted 200 to 300 feet from shore yesterday at Dungeness Spit
. They breached multiple times moving west until out of sight. Seals had been seen in the area earlier. -Ryan Maddock

Two adult and one young Humpback whales swam past us at Thieves Bay, Pender Island, BC
- so exciting. -Pat Crossley
