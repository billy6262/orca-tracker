We spent the afternoon with a beautiful, tight group of
Southern Residents as they headed north in Haro Strait
. We were with the
K13's, L4's, L26's, and L47's
. They traveled up the west side in such a large group - this isn't something we've seen very much of this year. It was such a joy to see, it used to be common, these days it is rare due to scarcity of Chinook salmon. We left them at Battleship Island as they continued up Haro Strait beside two huge bulk carriers. -Barbara and David

Approx
5:20 p.m.
I caught up to them at
County Park
, eventually most all 35+ whales grouped together. Gorgeous! It was so beautiful and heartwarming to finally see them all together like that, dorsal after dorsal surfacing as they passed the park continuing north towards Open Bay as I left. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

Finn L116 (member of the L4 matriline)
. Cali K34 (son of K13) cartwheeling off the shores of San Juan Island today. -Melisa Pinnow
*
L92 Crewser in closest as residents passed Lime Kiln State Park this afternoon
. -Astrid Heinisch
*

5:04 p.m. - still northbound, slowed up at Lime Kiln
. Not bad pass at Land Bank, They had angled towards shore, but hen at the big kelp patch they chose to go outside of it! Some big breaches North once they passed!

1:55 p.m. -
Milling a little but staying off shore... Maybe 75 yards or more? Maybe some are even flipping back South?

1:38 p.m. -
From Land Bank. See them at
north Hannah Heights
.. Almost to that point before Land Bank. Leaders are porpoising. -Cher Renke
*

4:30 p.m. - See SRKWs coming north again
. This time 5-6 whales in lead in 1-2s. Few more to outside. Last to pass was a group of 9-10 bunched up pretty tight as
they passed Land Bank at a steady pace
.
Approx

1:30 -
2:00 p.m. - from Land Bank watched residents approaching from the south
. Lead orca made it to WW cabin between north and middle Land Bank, with others trailing in a line single file. Long dive then they flipped and all turned back south. Some veered more offshore, eventually they continued south and out of sight. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Sunshine and whale reports, a great start to our adventure today! As we motored into Rosario Strait, we had a report of
transient (Biggs Orcas, meat-eating type) coming in in an easterly direction
. However, we then heard there were
residents right along Hein Bank
, much closer. After a quick stop at Colville Island to see harbor seals, we caught up with big male
L92 Crewser and more of L pod
as they headed straight for San Juan Island. After some nice time with them, we moved further out toward Hein Bank and enjoyed watching
L72 Racer
, as well as
part of J pod
. Overall, we saw
an estimated 20 whales from all three pods
, though very spread out and mostly traveling. Very nice smooth water, warm temperatures, and great views of our resident orcas! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
*

7:55 a.m. -
Suzy McNabb spotted
a minke whale 300 yards off Land Bank
, west side San Juan Island foraging. Now (
8:00 am) heading steadily north.
*
Just before sunset tonight two Orca's cruised by Echo Bay on Sucia Island
, while we were anchored at Ewing Cove, Matia. We followed them around as they swam by Fossil bay then it got too dark too follow them. -Noelle Morris
*
I watched
a small group of orcas approach from the east end of Bullman Beach
; they moved steadily westward near the edge of the kelp beds then lost them as they neared Sail and Seal Rock. Soon,
one of three gray whales
I had been watching for quite some time and closely after seeing the orcas, who was feeding between those rocks and the shore, suddenly leapt far out of the water.
The orcas appeared
, leaping and diving about in the same place. They continued for a half of an hour according to my camera footage clock before I had to leave home. I could not see thru my video viewer well enough and later found I kept panning back and forth past them. Ohh

# heartbreaking. I did not see any of the grays for some hours, they were immediately silent and unseen for the rest of the evening. I went out on the water early this afternoon
(
August 23), seeing three grays about.
I was able to view two closely but not the third, who is staying very close to shore west of Sail and Seal Rock and Sail River. I will try again Wednesday to view her. I know there were a number of people watching from a viewpoint above Snow Creek so we may find some good video if someone mentions it on line...our location is
just east of Neah Bay
. Been here for >35 years. -Maureen
