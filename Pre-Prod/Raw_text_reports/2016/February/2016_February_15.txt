Orca Sightings for February 15, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
...Orca got on scene at
1142
about
a half mile southeast of Turn Island
mid-strait just a little closer to the SJI side than the Lopez Island side. The whales were the
T60's and T2B
again.
T2B, T60, and T60F
were actively engaged in the attack on a harbor seal who was trying to take refuge by a stray piece of kelp....The whales
exited Cattle Pass
and headed southeast in a loose group. Orca ended the encounter at 1452 about three quarters of mile east of the Salmon bank buoy. Read full CWR Encounter #11 report. -Dave Ellifrit , Center for Whale Research

- Steady rain but at

9:00 AM
news of
a pod of Orcas off of Eagle Pt.
, headed toward America's Camp. We had scheduled a
10:00 AM trip, rather than the usual
1:00 departure, thankfully. By
2:30 we had searched down to the southern tip of Lopez Island, with no luck. Figuring that we had either passed them, or that they had turned up San Juan Ch., we turned around. Twenty minutes later I spotted the
T60s near Whale Rocks, heading east
. They must have turned up the channel, into an ebb tide, and decided to go into the quiet waters off of South Lopez. Shortly after spotting them they made a kill, and we were so fortunate to be able to watch them as they fed off the kill. I would guess perhaps a couple of seals were on the menu. Here are a few images from the day. -Capt Jim Maya, Maya's Legacy Charters

) again. Today

9:37 a.m. - Spouts off Marina Beach in Edmonds
. We think it's a
humpback
. Very exciting! It seemed to be headed north, but now from Sunset Ave we saw a whale seemingly headed south. -Tara Bergin

A friend suggested I let you know about a whale sighting I had from the
Edmonds pier in Edmonds, WA
, even though it's been a couple of weeks since I saw the whale. While I was bird-watching from the pier on Feb 15 during a steady rain, at

8:52am a Humpback Whale surfaced about 150-200 yards directly out from the pier
. It was facing north. It dove about a minute later and stayed down for 20 minutes. When it re-surfaced, it was facing south and still in the same general area. After another minute, it dove again, and when it came up again after 27 minutes, it was in the same area and facing north again. It soon
dove for the third time, at
9:43am
, and I did not see it again. I left the pier at 11am. Is it possible to identify this particular humpback from the pattern on its fluke? -Joe Sweeney, NE Seattle
