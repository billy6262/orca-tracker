On our previous update
on 16 February, K33 and likely the rest of K pod were off the Columbia River
, having just turned north. They traveled about half way up the the Long Beach Peninsula by that afternoon before turning south. On the
morning of the 17th they were off the Columbia River again
. Unfortunately, we received our last transmission about noon that day. We suspect that the tag detached as the battery levels were still good and this deployment of about 50 days was very similar to what we obtained for J27 last year. We are putting all the location data from K25, L84, and K33 to use as we attempt to locate the whales from the NOAA vessel Bell.
