============================================================

Entry 1:
3:30 -
5:30 PM. - Juan de Fuca - Orca Pod hunting sea lion east of Sequim - A pod of five orcas
was hunting a sea lion at
Diamond Point
. This family had
two full grown adults and three smaller juveniles
. They seemed to be teaching the little ones to hunt. The whole grouping slowly drifted west from Diamond Point to Thompson Spit from The sea lion seemed to escape into the shallow waters and the orcas didn't follow it onshore into the shelf area. It got dark, so we don't know if the sea lion finally escaped or not. They were hunting a large sea lion. Breaching, heading, spy hopping, and pouncing. They hunt like cats! -Megan Black
