Orca Sightings for February 29, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
29 February update - As of our last update
on 25 February L95 and some of L pod were just north of the Columbia River heading north. When we relocated them on Friday morning they were north of the Columbia River heading
south. The whales were very spread out and visibility was low due to fog and drizzle, making keeping track of then challenging as they were not vocalizing. In the early afternoon they started calling again and
we heard K pod calls and observed some K pod whales in the area with L pod
. We continued to monitor the whales into the evening acoustically. However,
Friday morning was the last transmission we received from L95s tag such that when the whales stopped vocalizing early on the morning of the 26th we lost track of them
. When we saw L95 the day before we did not detect a tag attachment issue and he was resighted on the 27th.
We were able to relocate Ks and Ls on the 27th
, again
just north of the Columbia River
and stayed with them well into the night until they stopped vocalizing
near Tillamook Head
. Seas were rough that day so we could not conduct small boat work but we could observe them from the Shimada and besides
documenting the presence of all 3 of the L pod calves born this past year
we also witnessed another episode of multiple breaches by numerous whales over a period of about 30 minutes, very similar to a bout of breaching we observed on the 2015 cruise. High winds and seas curtailed our efforts to conduct a broad search for K and L pods on the 28th, and with the extended forecast calling for continued high swell and winds we headed north and as of the 29th we are near the entrance ot the Strait of Juan de Fuca searching for J pod. -courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging
