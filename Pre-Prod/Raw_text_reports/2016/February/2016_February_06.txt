Watching a pod of orcas in
Saratoga Passage
today = happy! There seemed to be four whales (one big one, two medium sized and a smaller one). They hung out in the area
between Greenbank and Penn Cove
for a couple of hours, seemed to be fishing. We last saw them heading south quickly around
4:30pm. The water was totally smooth so we had great viewing! -Fran Farley Kendall

About

1:30-
1:45 p.m
. Sunny day, air temp 70s, water 57-59.
Manhattan or Hermosa Beach, CA
: seen to the north of my position at 22nd St., Hermosa Beach, not far outside the surf swell.
Single whale
, traveling north parallel to beach, surfaced twice, several minutes apart.
Black, arched back and tall black dorsal fin
, slow-moving, no display of tail flukes. Moving north toward a small group of surfers. Based on videos and photos, I would say the one I saw in Manhattan/Hermosa Beach was
a female orca

10:45 a.m. - Hi, we saw a gray whale near Alki Beach
today. It was at

10:45 am
and it was heading south towards the Alki lighthouse. We saw it's backside come out of the water with lots of barnacles and then we saw it come up twice more to spout before we lost it in the distance. -Jennifer Tudor
