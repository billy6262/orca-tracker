Had to google it to ID it.
Fin whale spotted off Duwamish Head, Elliott Bay
, about

2:30 p.m
. Moving very slowly, gradually headed north. Someone in a row boat (!) was standing up taking pictures. Hope someone sent one to you. I saw a huge back, what I thought was a back. Rounded and gray. At first I thought it was a humpback, and that's what I was googling for today. What threw me was that 'in front' it had a sharp dark 'thing' stick out, so at first I thought it was a gigantic sea lion. Then I realized that I didn't know what it was, but it was large enough to be a whale, just one I hadn't seen before. When I saw the picture online of the fin whale in September that's when I knew what it was. I saw nothing else. Slowly moving north. -Robyn Fritz
