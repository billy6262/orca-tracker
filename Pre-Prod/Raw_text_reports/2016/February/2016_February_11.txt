Orca Sightings for February 11, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Heard
multiple blows
this evening in
Yukon Harbor
. Walking along SE Cornell Road about
18:45 we heard sound of whale blowing and traveling Northwards between Blake Island and the road.
I am hoping its the same Orca
seen by Sam Wempe on the 6th in the same area. I will keep a close eye out tomorrow. -Paul Lee
