On the previous update posted on the 24th
L95 and likely most of L pod were off the Quinault Canyon on the evening of the 23rd
, trending southeast. They continued south and we were with them most of the day o
n the 24th off the Grays Harbor area
. The whales were extremely spread out such that we lost contact with them for a couple of hours due to reduced visibility and no vocalizing. By the afternoon we relocated them and were able to stay with them all night.
This morning (the 25th) they were off the entrance to the Columbia River
and after traveling a few miles south, they turned north and were just north of the shipping channel entering the Columbia River by this evening. Weather conditions in the afternoon were spectacular and we were able to conduct small boat operations with the whales. L72 Racer and the NOAA vessel Bell M.

We were contacted this morning by Jeanne Hyde. She spoke those magical words you always want to hear, "
J pod, including J2 Granny, is here
. Now." We had a beautiful, sunny day with lots of whales. It feels like summer is just around the corner. -Maya's Legacy Whale Watch

Lots of
porpoise just south of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge
today. We cut the engine and just watched them for a good half hour before we had to leave. There were quite a few of them! -Rachel Easton
