Good morning all! Actually, GREAT morning! I'm hanging with

Nisqually Reach
. Seems to be alone. -Denise Roswell

5:00 a.m. - Humpback
reported on Kitsap Orca Watch this morning off
Manchester
by Noelle Morris. Feeding behavior. Too dark for photos.

The Island Explorer 4 has spotted her first
gray whale
of the season just
off Camano Head
! We left scene at around 1PM with the whale headed in the northbound direction. We do not have a positive ID on the animal, but we do know that it is not 723, Lucy! This means that there is more than one gray in the area! With the first trip departing Everett tomorrow, we hope to firm up an ID on this individual and find some more!

1 gray Whale
(not 723) seen
between Whidbey Island and south Camano Island
