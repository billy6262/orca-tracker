Orca Sightings for March 2, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
My first Gray Sighting,
Manaco Beach...Camano Island...Saratoga Pass...just north of Cama Beach S.P.
This always seems to happen in the first five days of March. Heard and then saw my first Gray of the year this morning
about 10am
. It was moving north, rather close in, just outside our moorings. When our Labrador was younger, she would hear them first and give us a single bark while facing the direction of the beach. Now I must use an outdoor microphone to hear them coming. -Dick Schlueter

1:30 - Grays at Hat Island, Possession Sound, Everett. -Robin Araniva

10:45am - Small humpback whale between Southworth and Blake Island
now. -Scott Davis

12:30 UPDATE! south Puget Sound humpback just headed north out of Eld Inlet toward the center of the channel between Boston Harbor and Hunter Point
. If it stays on that path, it may head out of Dana Passage. It is doing shallow surfacing and shallow dives. Three within about 4 minutes. Then it dives for long periods of time.

11:00 UPDATE! It is a humpback.
I have seen three breaches, a 'spy hop' of sorts, a few rolls, and 5 surfacing series. It is currently heading north of
Budd Inlet passing Boston Harbor
. My hands are so cold I can hardly type. Very distant, gray photos to come. It is pouring rain.

9:40 am - Humpback in south Puget Sound
.

9:00 -
surfacing and then LONG dives heading south - passing Boston Harbor and toward Budd Inlet. -Kim Merriman
