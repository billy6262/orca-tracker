============================================================

Entry 1:
1:39 p.m. -
Yep I have been
watching both for 4 hours now

8:18 a.m. - Actually 2 whales. 2 blows!

8:12 a.m. - Camano Island, gray whale between Dana Point and Mabana Heights
. Appears to be feeding behavior. -Sally Olin

A very blustery and very "rough" day in Saratoga Passage, but Mystic Sea Charters found
gray whales #723 and #531 separated by a mile or so, mid-channel and south of Elger Bay
, heading south. Photo shows the top of #531's fluke with interesting pattern. -Jill Hein

12:58 p.m. -
Mystic Sea just called our Langley Whale Center to report
gray whale #531 near Mabana
, close to Camano, and another gray (possibly #723, but unconfirmed) at Elger Bay.

11:30 a.m. -
Yes saw them
blowing at Elger Bay
... I didn't see the direction they left towards. -Lorri Garske

5:00 p.m. -
I think I say a gray
(humpback) whale in the Nisqually Reach
. (humpback based on other sightings/photos and further details from Rosemarie). I live on Johnson Point outside of Olympia. My house has a view of the Nisqually Reach from Devil's Head, the Drayton Passage, Anderson Island and down towards the Wildlife Refuge. I watched what appeared to be a young gray periodically breaching while traversing the Reach in the direction of the Nisqually Refuge. My first whale sighting. It seemed as if the whale would shoot perpendicularly out of the water, appear to remain suspended for a few seconds and then lean/topple to the right. There were at least 4 breaches before I lost sight of the whale. It was during one of the periodic lulls yesterday from the high winds. Wow!! I hope this is helpful. -Rosemarie M. Robinson

3:28 p.m. - Two whales southwest key peninsula
heading southeast - multiple breaching ... Two, dark grey with white underside, no defined dorsal. Came straight up, twisted and fell on their backs....Watching from Johnson point looking northeast. Went around Johnson Point, heading to Nisqually region. -Tina Davis

Here's the
second humpback whale
, crustier than the first. They were about a mile away, during a rain squall. Taken from the east shoreline of
Harstine Island
in the south sound, on Case Inlet. About a mile south of Herron Island.

2:30 p.m. - Spotted 2 whales breaching in Case Inlet near Fudge Point, heading south. -Dave Berliner
