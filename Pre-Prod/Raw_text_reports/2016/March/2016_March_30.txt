We received a call at

3:30 from Blythe Marshman of the Bodega Marine Lab in CA. She was 80% sure she saw an orca
close to shore near a seal rookery there at the lab in Bodega Bay. She only saw the dorsal fin once, very close to shore, then it disappeared and she couldn't find it again. She said the seals were all way up on the rocks, so it's quite possible a Transient was cruising the area looking for lunch. -Susan

Enjoying the unusually warm weather, Mystic Sea headed out to find
gray whales - we had four of them
today, quite a treat. First off,
#531 was feeding in the shallow bays near Everett
, often on her side with her pectoral fin showing, and also part of her fluke (tail). Next we found
#723 who surprised us by his close pass-by, then #49 Patch joined in, followed by #383 who gave us many looks at his fluke
. The water was like a mirror, so beautiful, happy smiles for everybody. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
*
Ok, so the transient orcas gave us the slip today (sigh) but we did catch up with a few grays and one that is quickly becoming my favorite, a female,
#531 who was near Everett
. She has the most beautiful marbled markings on her back, on both sides, and the underside of her tail is easy to ID. -Renee Beitzel
*
We had a rare visitor this afternoon! This
Gray Whale spent a couple hours swimming up and down McAllister Creek within a stone's throw of the Estuary Boardwalk Trail
- it only happens once ever few years! As the tide went out, we were worried as it got caught up on a couple sandbars, but it finally headed out to the deep waters of Puget Sound. -Michael Schramm/USFWS,
