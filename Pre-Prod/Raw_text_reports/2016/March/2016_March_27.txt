Wow, only

12:30
on Easter Sunday and already had an awesome (albeit VERY wet) orca encounter with the
J17's and J22's
(thanks Ivan!) near Upright Head. I am absolutely floored by the size of J38! He used to be such a runty little dude and now definitely sprouting and becoming a strapping young fellow. -Katie Jones

. -Karen Steve Smith

Enjoying another day of sunshine, we left Langley and headed towards Camano Head where a whale had been spotted earlier, no luck there so we headed to
Hat/Gedney Island and were rewarded with the sight of three of our favorite gray whales, feeding together. We had #49 Patch, #531 and #723.
They slowly traveled along the east side of the island, then we heard there was
a Humpback whale near Baby Island! A Humpback??
We headed northward, and sure enough, a humpback whale was feeding in the entrance to Holmes Harbor, along with many California sea lions and harbor porpoise, and seabirds. What a treat and very unusual - an amazing day for sure. -Jill Hein - volunteer naturalist.
