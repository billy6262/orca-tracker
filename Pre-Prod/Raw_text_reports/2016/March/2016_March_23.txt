Today was one of those perfect Pacific Northwestern days. There is something so captivating about watching a pod of killer whales swimming through narrow channels against a beautiful, lush, green backdrop ... I feel very lucky to have had the privilege to see these
mammal-hunting animals today. Even though this family spends a lot of time in northern Johnstone Strait and southeastern Alaska, we caught up with these killer whales in Saanich Inlet....the well-known T100s, T101s, and T124A-1

A great day!
Transient Orcas, the 100s, and 101s, and 124a1, in the south stretch of Saanich Inlet
, a deep and narrow fjord north of Victoria, BC. That's T102 carrying the kill. I've never seen Orcas there before because I've never been there before. Aboard the Peregrine, Maya's Legacy Whale Watch. -Capt. Jim Maya,

Humpback or possibly Gray Whale in Budd Inlet.
I am the coach of the Olympia Yacht Club Junior Sailing program. Today,
March 23, at our High School Sailing practice we had a whale join us! We were practicing at the very southern end of Budd Inlet near the Port Plaza dock. The whale surfaced 2 times, roughly 7 minutes apart, spouting both times a vertical column of water. The first time it surfaced less than 200 yards from my boat. I suspect it was a humpback, it was a grey/pinkish color with with barnacles on it's back. It was quite the thrill as the inlet is both narrow and shallow near the OYC (we set marks that day and only had to feed out about 30ft of line), a large whale is the last thing I'd expect to see that far south! -Sara Hanavan
