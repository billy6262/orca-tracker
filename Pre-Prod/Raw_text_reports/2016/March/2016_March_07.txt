Orca Sightings for March 7, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sunrise to Sunset with
J pod off Cape Flattery
. "We were right off Cape Flattery and little did we know that we would end up tracking these whales all day as they were scouring the deep canyons off the coast. Within minutes Candi Emmons had spotted the
J11s and J14s
, it wasn't until later that she spotted
J2, L87
and the others confirming that we were with
all of J pod
....It seems like the last week or so we have found them in this general location...." -Peggy Foreman, NOAA Fisheries

...We left Snug Harbor at 1250 and got
on scene at 1326 about a mile and a half north of Swartz Bay
. Since both Peregrine and Legacy had recently left the whales, we had to re-find them which we did after a brief search. The
T18's (T18, T19, T19B, T19C) had already exited Shute Passage into Satellite Channel
and appeared to be resting as they were traveled slowly west in a tight group... Read full summary at CWR T18s Encounter #16. -Dave Ellifrit & Deborah Giles, CWR
