Orca Sightings for March 22, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm partnering up with Tony on this observation and we're looking through a spotting scope at a distance of approximately 2 miles plus. We thought we would identify it by the single-column blow and the long duration between blows (10 to 15 min). Admittedly, I'm a birder and not an experienced whale watcher so anything is possible....We were only able to spot the fluke and the head of the animal after it spouted. It appeared to be white under the mouth and down the ventral side. Because of the great distance, even with 36x spotting scope, we considered the duration between blows which was greater than 10 min and as much as 15. We know there were
at least three animals
. Again, I am not an experienced whale observer. I have seen numerous Humpbacks while in the Navy in Hawaii but they were only 100 meters from the ship. I counted gray whales in Monterey Bay for school but they were less than one kilometre away. -Bob Schultz
