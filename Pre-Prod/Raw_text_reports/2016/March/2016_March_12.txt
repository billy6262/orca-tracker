Orca Sightings for March 12, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today
off Lime Kiln - J17 Princess Angeline and her new little one, J53
. As much as I love greeting the J-Pod whales I've known for years, it's so exciting to meet a new addition to the family! -Monika Wieland
*
Surprise -
J Pod is back!
I couldn't have been happier to welcome J Pod back into the Salish Sea today. They were a little elusive in the morning, but by the afternoon
we found them right outside of our harbor (Snug Harbor)
heading up the west side of San Juan Island.
As usual, the first orca to pass us was none other than J2 Granny
who is getting older in her years. She is estimated to be born in 1911, and while she may not be exactly 105 years old, she's still the oldest orca ever recorded that we know of! J19 Shachi and J40 Suttles followed behind while her daughter and grandson played nearby. It was so nice to see her and the rest of my favorite matriline, the J16s. -Heather MacIntyre, Maya's Legacy
*
J pod in Haro Strait, spread in loose family groups across the border and traveling North
. It was our first time seeing
J28 with her new calf, J54
, born
December 2015. We'd just launched our 'Bullfrog' tender and she skipped like a stone through sunshine, hailstorm squall and a rainbow. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing
*
Js today
....I think everyone was there. They were
last seen heading N up Swanson Channel, BC
. They passed right in front of our dock at Snug Harbor Resort. -Jim Maya, Maya's Legacy Whale Watch
*
JPOD!!! J pod moseyed on by Lime Kiln State Park today on the west side of San Juan Island
. They were getting pushed up with the flood tide and taking it nice and slow doing some foraging behavior as they went. They were very spread out, some closer to San Juan Island and some further out in the middle of Haro Strait. Today I also saw my favorite orca and her newest calf!
J28 (Polaris) and J54!

Between

12:15-
2:15 I saw all of J-Pod head north past Lime Kiln in very slow-moving, spread out groups
. I didn't identify every whale since some were way offshore but did see members of every matriline, including
J2, who was closest to shore, and J53 and J54
. At
2:15 the trailers were several miles offshore still facing north but not making much progress. Now that I'm back home there are still some calls on the hydrophones, so they may have turned and are coming back south. -Monika Wieland
