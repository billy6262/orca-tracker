Unusual southbound travel in Colvos passage
. Current is always northbound here, and we just heard
2nd whale today at 2200
, extremely close to west shore on surface blowing dozen times, heading southbound. The whales always travel northbound thru here. There was another about noon today same path heading south. Wonderful to see so much activity today. Not sure if it was humpy or grey? -Tim Ferris
