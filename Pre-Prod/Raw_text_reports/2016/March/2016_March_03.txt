Orca Sightings for March 3, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
...around
5 or 6 pm
as I was stuck in traffic on hwy 99 northbound I saw a whale or possibly slow moving porpoise?
out in front of Seattle, just northwest of the Ferris wheel. Could it be the humpback?
I never saw any dorsal fin. Unfortunately I couldn't get out my binocs because I was driving. -J.K., a birder from Snohomish County.
