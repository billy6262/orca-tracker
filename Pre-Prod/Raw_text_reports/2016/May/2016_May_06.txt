Orca Sightings for May 6, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:30-
9:00 p.m. - 2 marine mammals black and white with fins.
They are breaching, tail slapping, making lots of noise out in the
middle of Dabob Bay
. There are two that we can see. Didn't have time to run and get binoculars to make better identification. To me, from this distance, looks like orca, but there are only two that we can see. Feeding. One went almost completely out of the water. Lots of tail slapping and heavy respirations. They were sort of apart, maybe 40 feet from each other, and then very close to each other and heading southeast as the light of day disappeared. -Kirie Pedersen

7:00 p.m. - 4 Orca sighted , north end of Dabob Bay Hood canal
. 2 very large and 2 lesser, but still big whales. They moved rapidly south down the Hood Canal. They alternated swimming underwater and on top , spouting large plumes as the surfaced. -Todd Daugherty
*

10:30 a.m. - just north of Hoodsport.
Spotted
5 orcas on the far side of the canal
- at least one appeared pretty small. Watched them for 30 minutes - breaching, spyhopping, thrashing around (apparently hunting). They were moving north at a leisurely pace. Saw them again 3 hours later north of the Hamma Hamma River - still on the far side. The water was getting too choppy to see them well. - Sherrie & Tom Michalski
*

8:30 a.m. - The Orcas (10 including adult males) are in the Hood Canal
. It might be time for another seal feed; It's been quite a few years since I've seen them in here. Playing, jumping. They were near shore and in the middle of the canal (two groups) Nick Cecil
