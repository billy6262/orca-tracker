5:30 p.m. - I saw the J16's traveling south past the Center for Whale Research, spread out over several miles, with
J16 and J50
in the lead,
J26
much farther out in Haro Strait, and later
J36, J42 and J52
came within 200 yards of shore past the Center. A half hour earlier the J16s had gone past the Center going north, and 20 minutes later they came by again heading north again. While scanning for the J16s I noticed one or two very tall blows probably two miles off Lime Kiln, and through the scope saw the back of
a humpback
as it dove. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

7:20 p.m. - Watching 3 orcas at Whisky Spit just north of Hood Canal bridge
. They are far off from us as we are opposite Port Gamble, but they appear to be actively feeding. Tribal canoe was out practicing and was very close. Hoping the crew had phone cams at least and that they post pics. -Paul Hebert

right across from Lofall about 3 miles south of Hood Canal Bridge...we live on the water and we were able to see them clearly. -Sandy Lyon

I'm
a mile north of Jorstad creek

9:34 a.m. -
I see them! At least 4 individuals hanging around in the rip current. Couldn't get a good pic with my phone as they were pretty far off the shore. I'm on
Hwy 101 at Jorstad Creek
(Hood Canal). -Rebecca Samuelson

Approx
7:30 a.m. -
I have seen them everyday since my last email including this morning.
The pod was 3 miles north of Hoodsport East shore (Tahuya side
), they were heading north. There is an ORCA buoy roughly 2 miles north of Hoodsport mid channel, they were north of that about 1/2 mile or so. Time was 730am or so. -Cindy Sund
