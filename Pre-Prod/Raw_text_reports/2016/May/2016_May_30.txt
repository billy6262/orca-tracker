Orca Sightings for May 30, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Newbie alert!
Little un' with T100B, fresh with fetal folds, at most 7 days old
. We saw T100B on
May 22nd with no baby, and today
in the Strait of Georgia
she was with her new little one along
with the rest of the T100s and the T123s
. -Tasli Shaw

We saw breaching orcas
from the Nanaimo ferry
, close to shore as we pulled away
from Vancouver Island
, this morning at
11 AM
. No ID's but at least one big male, very active breaches as the pod (
about 4-5
I think) travelled along the
Strait of Georgia
. A lovely surprise encounter. -Steve Smith

Calm seas were back for our Memorial Day trip, yay! We headed south, then west, towards
Discovery Island (almost to Victoria, BC)
based on reports of
a humpback whale and Transient/Biggs killer whales!
Unfortunately the killer whales turned west and headed out past Sooke, BC, but the humpback turned our way and we had some excellent views as the whale (no ID yet)
slowly headed towards San Juan Island
. We watched several tail flukes before heading back east, enjoyed all the Steller sea lions at Whale rocks, and found some very pregnant harbor seals near Castle Rock (seal pup season is fast approaching). An awesome Memorial Day trip! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

10:30 a.m. - a gray whale
spouted, surfaced, rolled a bit, and then dove with a huge fluke display just 150-200 yards offshore at
Lagoon Point on Whidbey Island
. It was headed south and seemed to be "en route" somewhere beyond us. Magnificent! Traveling and we assume eating as there is good supply off our shoreline! -Dianne Bratz
