a youngish humpback whale off Edgewater Beach in Mukilteo!
Watched from

Took the

5:30 ferry from Mukilteo to Clinton
. As we were loading we saw a huge gray whale (was a
humpback
) north of the dock and close to shore doing what I call "flaps" with his HUGE fins. Excuse the layman terms, but it was quite a show - heading south. -Kathy Stevens Hitsemann

After only living here on Vancouver Island for just over a year, I spotted from our back deck, what I think is my first
Humpback in the Satellite Channel, near Artbutus Ridge at 10am
. He was fluking, spy-hopping and breaching before heading down past Mill Bay. Behaviors: feeding, playing, traveling. Surprisingly loud when they blow. -Deirdre Zlomanchuk
