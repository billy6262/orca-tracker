Bigg's killer whale encounter! It's such a humbling experience sharing this ecosystem with some of the most sentient beings on this Earth. We spent the day with nearly twenty mammal-hunting Bigg's killer whales and watched as they made predation event after predation event, and entered into a period of very social bliss towards the end of the day. Watching that many individuals, listing to the phonemail vocalizations through our hydrophone, and witnessing that kind of tactile behavior from this eco-type of killer whale is incredibly rare!! They're usually very quiet, inconspicuous, and stealthy to exploit their intelligent marine-mammal prey ...Pictured here are the
T036A's, T065A's, T065B's (sisters who were also seen here exactly a year ago to the date), T093, T097, T99's, and the T123's
