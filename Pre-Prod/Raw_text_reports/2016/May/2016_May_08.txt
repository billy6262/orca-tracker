There were reports of whales as we left Anacortes, so we took the scenic route through the San Juan Islands, then checked out Whale Rocks to see visiting Steller sea lions, and lots of harbor seals. Aha - received a report of Minke whales, so off towards
Hein Bank we saw two of the elusive Minke whales
, surfacing fairly frequently, in nice calm seas! As we headed back towards Lopez Island, several passengers caught sight of a blow and tail fluke behind us - YAY
a Humpback whale!
! So we turned around and caught several nice views of this whale (
possibly 2 whales
) .... before ultimately heading back to the dock with happy passengers. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
