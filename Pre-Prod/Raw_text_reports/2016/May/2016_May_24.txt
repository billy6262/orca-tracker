Entry 1:
About

3:45pm I was about 3.5 miles SW of Cleland Island, off the coast of Tofino
. I spent an hour and a half with them. As they continued down the coast SE. The largest male, the one you guys ID'd,
J27
rolled around on one of the females and we saw his dork at least three times. (photos show
J27 and K22 Sekiu and her son K33 Tika, & K34 Cali
). -Shaun Parniak, Shamrock Photography

J Pod was off Tofino
heading southwest from Cleland Rocks
about 3 miles offshore
. Shamrock Photography has photos including 2 of
J27
. Lots of beaching, tail lobbing and dork action We went out but the boats couldn't hold them for us and we lost them. Heading your way though! The last boat with them said they were travelling at 3 knots and stopping every 10 min to mill about. On a south west track though
around 7 pm
