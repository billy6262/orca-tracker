a single humpback from the Olympic Sculpture park

2-3 Humpback whales spotted on Seattle to Bainbridge Island ferry run around
1:30
. In the main channel, south in the main channel,
closer to West Seattle
than Bainbridge. At least two, maybe 3, based on frequency and spacing of whale spouts, but only clearly saw two backs and dorsal fins at the same time, and only two dives with flukes visible at approximately the same time. Traveling, diving, spouting. -Michael Pollock

Humpbacks in Port Orchard Bay this morning
. The first few seconds of this video the humpback is between the boat and light post. At 15-17 seconds you can hear/kinda see both the humpbacks at once. I'm bummed I didn't get video from the other side of the marina, it swam right next to the fuel dock but I was way too excited to think about video then. -Brittany Gordon

11:30 a.m. - The 2 humpbacks are exiting port orchard bay
right now at a fast pace heading NE.

11:19 a.m. - There are 2 humpbacks.
I got a video of it swimming right past the dock so close to me. I'm still shaking. They are headed northeast now in ferry lane.

11:10 a.m. - there is a humpback very close to Port Orchard marina
. -Brittany Gordon

9:05 a.m. -
Got a call from David Wartez, who saw a
whale in Elliot Bay
from the viaduct. He didn't know what it was but from the description it sounded like a humpback.

Before I took the watch here in the operations center at 0600 my predecessor Mike Boldt got a report at
0554
from the Cathlamet down at
Fauntleroy/Vashon/Southworth

three humpback whales approximately 3/4 of a mile off of the Fauntleroy dock
