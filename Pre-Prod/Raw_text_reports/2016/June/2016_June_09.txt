Orca Sightings for June 9, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
I arrive back on the island early in the morning and a few hours later
Js and the K16s
! Opus K16 passing close to shore at
Lime Kiln State Park
. -Melisa Pinnow
*
Nothing like watching wild whales swim off into the sunset.. from Land Bank on the west side of San Juan Island. -Monika Wieland
*

8:30 p.m. - Lime Kiln
was full so turned on OrcaSound around

8:30 to hear the sounds of Js and Ks
, repertoire of calls went on for two hours before I signed off. Echolocation, percussive, one an obvious breach. Beautiful, beautiful evening eavesdropping on the communication of this clan. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

8:22 p.m. - They are on BOTH! Lime Kiln AND Orcasound
!

7:59 p.m. - Lots of vocals now on Lime Kiln hydro
. Don't know who they are. Lots of variety. Anyone? -Kim Merriman
*

7:56 p.m. - Lime Kiln Hydrophone faint vocals
. -Melissa Howes
*
Some days are more magical than others! ...As our first trip of the morning departed,
Ks were discovered way west of Victoria
, too far. Ugh! So Capt. Alan NIles and naturalist Heather MacIntyre just went out and found
J Pod, coming down from the north
! By the time for my first trip of the day came around, some of the
Js were right in front of our dock at Snug Resort
. By my second trip, the Ks were close enough so we went to see them. We got to the Ks and interestingly, found
J2, Granny, and her surrogate son, L87, Onyx, leisurely traveling east with the Ks
. And then, both groups started racing toward each other and we were there to see it! It was amazing! Like two large groups of relatives, who like each other, having a family reunion! I'm so fortunate to be able to spend so much time on these amazing waters. -Capt Jim Maya, Maya's Legacy WW
*
We left Anacortes with reports of "lots of whales" coming in from the coast - so headed towards Victoria in hopes of meeting them. After checking seal haul-outs on Colville Island, we continued west and received better news,
members of J and K pods were heading towards us from the north end of San Juan Island
!! So we slightly altered course and picked up the leaders of this very spread out group. J-26 Mike was foraging a mile or so off-shore, along with other members of both J & K pods .... so good to see these endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales back in the Salish Sea! Homeward bound, we found 3 Steller sea lions hauled out on a channel marker. An exciting day aboard the Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
*

1:38 p.m. Just saw a whale south of the light house at Lime Kiln
web cam. -Kim Merriman
*

1:25 p.m. - Hearing some calls on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone
right now. -Denise Stubbs
*

1:11 p.m. - Orcas going nuts on orca sound. Positive ID K16, K35, K21 southbound in Haro strait near Sidney channel
. I'm on the 12pm ferry from Sidney to Anacortes. K21 booking it FAST southbound. -Ariel Yseth
*
We were on the search for killer whales, and hadn't found any after an hour and a half of our trip. That all changed when
J Pod, (and parts of K Pod
) found us! There's no better feeling then having the animals you want other people so badly to experience, and be inspired by to find you coming around the corner of Turn Point Light as you're about to start talking about the light house. It's a romantic notation, but it sure made my day. On another note, at the end of the day, I caught a glimpse of
J53 with what looks to be a young halibut in her mouth
. This had a somber note to it because these orcas should be feeding on Chinook salmon right now. They should be plentiful, and coming into the Salish Sea to spawn in the thousands, or would have been doing so now historically. The fact that this little calf was eating halibut only means that there's still no fish for these big blackfish. -Heather MacIntyre
*
J pod and K pod were inbound just west of Race Rocks
, when we caught up with
K26 Lobo and L87 Onyx
as they traveled together while
J40 Suttles
swam ahead of them. At one point she decided to surprise us with a close pass off our port bow! Startled everyone because we were't expecting it....trip also included
two humpbacks, one of them being BCY0409 Yogi
, who has also been seen in Hawaii! So good to see the southern residents again! -Renee Beitzel
*

10:44 a.m. - J's and some K's inbound from Sooke Now
! -Paul Pudwell
*

7:30 - One or two humpbacks just went past West Seattle,
between Brace Pt. and Three Tree Point (Burien), heading south about 200 yards from shore. -Thanks for the call by Gail McElligott.
*
There were
two humpbacks
out there today. (middle Sound
between Point No Point/Edmonds/south Whidbey
) They came together briefly after one was surface active with cartwheeling and lob-tailing. We left for a while but then came back to them being apart again, though in same general area. One of them was
BCX1210
which was in the same general area last year in October! The dorsal fin tipped me off. -Renee Beitzel
*

6:08 p.m. - Humpback
still active!! Blows and fluke high on dives. Line of sight from north Edmonds is Double Bluff. Whale is
between Pt No Pt and Useless Bay

1:55 p.m. -
Seems to be "playing" short dives and just going back and forth in different directions. My line of sight from north Edmonds is the houses on the east side of Scatchet head, but the
humpback is south of Possession point
.

1:10 p.m. -
huge blows still. And flukes up high into dives!
South of Possession Point a couple miles
. Last dive it looked to be heading (or feeding) north westerly. (in direction of Scatchet Head)

10:11 a.m. - humpback breaching!! South east of Point No Point
. -Stu Davidson
