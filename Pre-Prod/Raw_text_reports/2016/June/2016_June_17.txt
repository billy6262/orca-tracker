Orca Sightings for June 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
...We headed down to Snug and left aboard "Shachi" at 1651. The whales, who turned out to be the
T46's and T73A's
, had taken a right at
Battleship Rock and had entered the western part of Spieden Channel
so we went through Mosquito Pass and got on scene about a quarter mile east of Battleship Rock at
1703

Downwind sail against the flood through Cattle Pass to meet incoming transient orcas,
T46's and T73A's
. We all ran the flood up the west side. (San Juan Island) We observed the kids playing with their food, a harbor seal lifted into the air. A great kerfuffle of bait fish, gulls, and rhinoceros auklets as the orcas surprised everyone surfacing from below the bait ball. Male orcas
T46E
was close alongside of
T73A1
all day, with frisky playful contact.
T46
born estimated 1964 was in the last live capture in Puget Sound's Budd Inlet, Olympia, but was released. Thankfully instead of a life in captivity, she went on to have at least 6 offspring and is also a great-grandmother.
We left the orcas north of Battleship
, were watched by a Peregrine Falcon, and a fiery sunset through San Juan Channel. -Barbara Bender/David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*
WA State Ferries called in a report of
7 orcas
, including 1 adult male, 3 adult females and 3 calves, crossing the international border at

6:40 PM
. (
Message a bit confusing, but based on this and earlier reports we believe this was off the
N. end of San Juan Island
, and the orcas were traveling north
).
*
Saw the
transients - there were about 10 orcas
that we saw. It was around

3:15-
3:30 pm
. We were by
Lime Kiln Point Lighthouse
. The whales were headed north...so amazing! -AnJenette Charlson
