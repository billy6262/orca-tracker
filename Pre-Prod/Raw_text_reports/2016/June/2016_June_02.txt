Orca Sightings for June 2, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:30 p.m. - Orca at Swiftsure bank.
...it was hard for me to determine that age of the orca, not that experienced, but definitely a young one. As this juvenile went by our boat, there was another whale that passed on the other side of the vessel, presumably mum (?). Also observed at least one other orca in the vicinity but too far to see much other than the dorsal, which was crescent shaped. All were traveling westward out Juan de Fuca Strait as we were moving from the east end of Swiftsure Bank towards Port Renfrew. All whales were traveling east rapidly, not feeding. The fin and markings on the juvenile hopefully help with ID, photos with an iPhone. ("While I'm not 100% positive, this little whale looks like
it could be L117 of the L54's.
