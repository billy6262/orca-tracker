Orca Sightings for June 26, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:00 p.m. - Common Dolphins came out of Budd Inlet
and are heading north to northwest. They are very active....even with a boat literally running right in the middle of them. They are circling around a large area.

1:30 p.m. - Dolphins are back.
They are very active and
heading south into Budd Inlet
. There are lots of boats around. Some know they are there and are watching. Others don't and motor right through where they are surfacing. -Kim Merriman

San Juans - Sunday morning we started our trip with sunny skies and warm weather. We had a light northerly wind and flat, calm seas. We cruised inner islands and caught up with
a large group of orcas off Java Rocks, in Canadian waters
, off Saanich Peninsula. We encountered transients
T123A and the T75s
, as they fed. The first spyhop of the day showed a female with a harbor seal in her mouth. Passengers watched intently as these stunning creatures breached, tail lobbed, and porpoised, perfect photographic opportunities with Mt. Baker as the back-drop. -Amy W. Mystic Sea and Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

A breach from one of the
T75s near Java Rocks
(Canadian water). -Jill Hein,

7:55 p.m. - At least 7 orcas (3 male, 4 female) sighted passing Fort Worden, headed east toward Pt Wilson
. 2 large males in front and less than 200m offshore. At least 4 females, possibly with juvenile, farther out. Male in rear. Females lob tailing and breaching. -Rebecca Mostow
*
We were at Botanical Beach, just o
utside of Port Renfrew. A humpback whale
slowly swam by; the back came out of the water, but the tail never did. It lingered for a couple dives at one spot, south of the access trail, off a couple rocks off the main shelf. Tide was 0.8 at 1245. Sighting was at approximately
1330
(I believe). We did not get any photos of the tail, for identification. Hope this is enough information. I've never seen them that close to shore, however I believe it drops off very quickly beyond the botanical shelf. There are kelp beds directly off the shelf and the whale was only 20 meters off them. Impressive! -Frank Gee (staff of Gulf Islands National Park Reserve)
*
A consistent presence in
Cultus Bay (SW Whidbey Island) over the last three days...Of a whale foraging in lower tides
... Most likely gray? No dorsal fin. Though can't see much of him/her...Acting
like a gray
...but seems late in the season.... -Deborah Houseworth

9:15 p.m.
Sunday evening. Active common dolphins in Budd Inlet feeding in front of Mt. Rainier. The
common dolphins in south Sound decided to head south into Eld Inlet
. Dolphins in Budd/Eld inlets. Lots of action during the feeding frenzy. All was quiet, except for their blows and surfacing series, and splashing around. Then, a few gulls screeching. Here is some very dark and grainy video as they passed by my house after having spent most of the last many hours north of here, feeding. -Kim Merriman

9:00 p.m. - they are still in the same area. S.E end of Squaxin Island
. They stalled in the area mentioned in the original post and began a feeding frenzy. They (15-20) of them were joined by their opportunistic friends. -Kim Merriman
