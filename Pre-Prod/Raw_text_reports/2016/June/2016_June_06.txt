Orca Sightings for June 6, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Beautiful! So many tail slaps, spyhops, pec slaps. At least 4 large males, 1 baby, and a slightly larger baby. From
Land Bank/Westside Preserve, San Juan Island
.
J14 Samish
continues northbound while other
members of J and K pods
slow to socialize and engage in tail lobs, breaches, pec slaps during their mid afternoon northbound pass off
Land Bank on the west side San Juan Island

3:00 pm. - Whales at Lime Kiln.
Just a quick update, there were tons of whales everywhere mostly inshore. But I did see
K12s, L87, J2, J14's, J17's, J10's, J11's
.
All of the J's plus L87 were headed up Haro
- but there were loads of whales offshore that we didn't see. We heard lots of J calls. Maybe a few Ks. But I didn't see any Ls that I know of unless I got some far distant photos... In going thru my photos, I found the
K14's and I also saw K21, K16 and K35
.

5:24 p.m. - Passing Battleship. J2 Granny
in the lead. -Barbara Bender

The Southern Resident drought is over!
Members of all three pods came back into the Salish Sea
, and I think many of us breathed a collective sigh of relief as
one group headed up to the Fraser River while another did the westside shuffle
, indicating that perhaps there are enough fish to keep them here for a least a while. This evening I was lucky enough to get out with members of J and K Pods near Stuart Island... -Monika Wieland

Approx.
1:00 p.m. - Out on the water with J & K pod. Haro Strait, west side San Juan Island
. Whales were traveling north and south throughout the trip. The highlight, not pictured, was when
J39 Mako
breached RIGHT next to the boat, so close he splashed the front of the boat getting people wet. Beautiful, beautiful day.
K21 Cappucino - Haro Strait
- West side San Juan Island. -Rachel Haight
*

4:25 p.m. - turned on Orca Sound. Hearing what sounds like faint Ks and loud Js.
-Alisa Lemire Brooks, Ora Network

T060C west bound at Race Rocks in the morning
. -Mark Malleson
*

3:16 p.m. -
it's still in a northerly towards
Scatchet head
direction. Unbelievable breach and arch into a dive (never seen that before with this large a whale!).

2:56 p.m. - Whale blow !! Must be a humpback or Gray
. Line of sight east of Point No Point and south of Scatchet head. Moving north towards Scatchet Head. As seen from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson

Approx
3:45 p.m. -
I was watching orcas off
Henry Island
. Just as the boats and whales moved east and behind the island so that I couldn't see them anymore, I heard 2 loud blows.
Then a large whale surfaced, blew, and dived with tail coming up, heading toward the same spot where the boats had been
. It was very close to shore which is how I heard the blow. I was on my deck at 45 Marian Pl. It seemed to be either a gray or a humpback. It was so exciting that I forgot to use my camera. -Jan Hare
*

3:50 p.m. - I'm at Land Bank, San Juan Island. Humpback
just cruised right by northbound in Haro Strait. 5 Shallow dives, and on the 6th, he/she went deep! -Cher Renke
*

2:10 p.m. - Humpback at Eagle Point southbound.
