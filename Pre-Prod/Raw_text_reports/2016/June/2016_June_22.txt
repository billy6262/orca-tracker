Orca Sightings for June 22, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Harbour Porpoise Predation in Haro Strait. I believe it was the T124A's
. (I haven't checked the i.d.'s yet) I was literally with the whales for 10 minutes at the end of the water taxi to Darcy Island. -Simon Pidcock
*
11 year-old sprouter male, T073A1.
T073A's gave us a run for our money today! Was hard to ID them due to their long down times, short surface intervals and erratic transient swim patterns. -Renee Beitzel
*

4:30 p.m. - 5-10 Orcas
moved rapidly southbound past
Hastie Lake Road (West Beach, NW Whidbey Island)
about a mile offshore. -Kevin Knight
*
A
humpback
was reported by Deborah Dabrock, about 7
:30PM in south Puget Sound, off Salter's Point Park
, Steilacom, heading south toward Anderson Island.
*

5:40 p.m. - 10-15 (or more) dolphins
heading just passing my house and
heading south into Eld Inlet
. Very active. Moving fast! They came out of "nowhere" from the north. I have been watching for them all day. Finally, they arrived. -Kim Merriman
*
It's possible the ones from this morning were the same ones from Budd and Eld inlets that have been in this area the last few days and up
until about
8:00 last night
. But anything at
7:15 p.m. last night could not be the same as the ones in front of my house. -Kim Merriman
*
Group of probable
common Dolphins milling in area approximately 1-2 miles north of Vashon Island, WA
. Spotted multiple times while operating Vashon water taxi from
0530-0830 am. First spotted on 6/21/16,
7:15 pm 1/4 mile off Alki Beach
. They were not traveling. Were milling in large circles at approximately 47.53 Lat by 122.44 long. Last night they were only a few hundred yards off the beach at Alki. 10-15 animals with at least two calves. -Christopher Howard
*

9:20am - Small group of Harbor porpoises
traveling steadily
between the Bremerton ferry channel and Alki near Duwamish head
. Traveling towards Elliott Bay. They looked mostly gray, possibly two-toned grays. I thought I saw two adults and one smaller one. They were surfacing at different times. -Sharon Wada
