Orca Sightings for June 5, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Approx.
4:45 p.m. - from Lime Kiln on their return southbound
. Here's a special little photo to me, my favorite of the day.
Little L123 with mom, Lapis (L103), L122, and Muncher (L91). Marina (L47), Ballena (L90), and Crewser (L92). Nugget (L55) and Takoda (L109).
Last fall a dear friend and I were the first to notice a new little fin and it turned out we weren't crazy and seeing things - Lapis had given birth to her first calf, L123! It was so thrilling to see this little one again knowing that it survived the winter and has grown so much since we first saw it last November. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Below is observations by Capt Barbara Bender on an interaction between residents and transients
)
Sara- We caught up with the
T60's by Mandarte after we left the L's.
Thanks for Id'ing the two by LK. ...But before that, there was
a scuffle between R's and T's! We saw a female and male coming north in Haro while Ls we're going south. L92 made a drastic sudden direction change towards them. Then the L47's with L122 in the mix started high speed swimming toward them too in a tight group. Meanwhile they had been spread in loose groups beforehand. The T's took off porpoising the minute L92 turned toward them! It was intense! It was very brief before R's continued south again while the T's kept porpoising! I am not sure if the two T's were T60 and T60C who caught up with the others near Darcy or if it was others.
I would love to put these puzzle pieces together! Were there only two T60's in on the seal kill? Were the other family members near? Because the 2 T's were just two in mid Haro all alone. And per the CWR website the J's chased them away a few years back! -Barbara Bender

We saw
J11s, J17s, and J22s.

Really nice to see the residents back in town! SPREAD OUT across the Strait of Georgia foraging. So nice to see a couple of the "Jabies",
J51 and J52. We had K12s, K14s, K16s but no K13s. Most of J pod too but didn't see any J17s or J22s.

With Orca Month, as officially proclaimed by Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, well underway, it was with a sense of celebration that we welcomed
members of the Southern Resident community back to the San Juan Islands today
. With reports of J and L pods in the vicinity, we encountered
part of L pod off the west side of San Juan at around
12:15 pm
. Although initially traveling in ones and twos, we witnessed the whales grouping up close to shore as they headed north. To say that it was a privilege to see them in their natural surroundings on such a glorious day would be an understatement. Shore-based whale-watchers must have enjoyed a treat as the
whales passed by Lime Kiln State Park
. Passengers were also fortunate to see both a California sea-lion basking on the rocks and Steller sea-lions swimming near Whale Rocks, where two bald eagles were resting. How lucky we are to have such a diverse selection of marine life among these treasured islands. -Sandra Pollard (Author/Naturalist).

More notes by Monika:
J Group A with all Ks but K13s made it up to Georgia Strait
so they were all here too. I haven't had a chance to go through my photos but were L47s in there with L4s, L26s, and L43s.

T60 and T60C
surprised us at
Lime Kiln
yesterday with a hunt on this harbor seal just north of the light house. At one point the seal made an attempt for the rocks but the whales cut it off and came in so close I'm pretty sure some people got splashed as T60 threw her tail around during a quick maneuver to intercept the seal. What an encounter!...It's always a privilege to see the top predators in our oceans and to see them hunting is both gut-wrenching and incredible....While the Bigg's killer whales do prey on marine mammals, they're hunting the way they've evolved to and it doesn't mean they're mean or more vicious than their fish-eating cousins. It means they're a predator and they're feeding themselves and their families the way they've done for thousands upon thousands of years. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
