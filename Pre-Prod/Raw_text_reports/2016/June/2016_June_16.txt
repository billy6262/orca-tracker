Orca Sightings for June 16, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
T101A passes by Victoria's Ogden Point breakwater in the afternoon
. -Mark Malleson
*
T46F, T46D and T46 -
4:50 p.m. - We were with the T46s
today and they were on a steady track east towards Admiralty Inlet. They've already passed Protection Island. -Renee Beitzel
*
Gary and I are camping off
Point Wilson at Fort Worden - Admiralty Inlet
. Tonight we were perched in our truck by the lighthouse watching for
possible T's
that may be heading that way. We spotted 3 distinctive blows from 3 whales: two bigger blows and one smaller. A pattern of 3-4 blows then they would dive and resurface approx 4-5 minutes later as if feeding. The blows would appear about 5-10 seconds apart in separate vicinity but close together as if traveling together. We watched them until they traveled north out of our view. The behavior reminded me of grays as we have watched grays off the Oregon Coast for 30 years. But they could have been possibly humpbacks? Never saw dorsal fins. Anyone report any sightings?? This was
about 7'ish
tonight. -Tammy Shelton

Short-beaked common dolphin! Off of Victoria!
The first time I've ever seen them! Very Rare! What are they doing in our "cold" waters? -Capt Jim Maya
