Orca Sightings for June 1, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted
a juvenile humpback
while boating in
The Narrows area
. First sighting was around
1pm
, just off of the north end of
Chambers Bay Golf Course
. We tracked the whale as it swam north, hugging the east shoreline, up to Pt. Defiance. Last sighting was
at about
4:15pm
, halfway between Pt. Defiance (Owens Beach side), and the south end of Vashon Island. We were hoping the whale might steer to the west side of Vashon, avoiding the POT shipping lanes, but we lost sight of it. :-( I sent a report with photos to DFW & Cascadia Research later that day. -Julia Hurley

1:15 p.m. -
I heard a blowing sound, looked & saw a long dorsal spine and a large tail flip up, just like the
Humpback Whales
I recently saw in CA. I saw it twice and Kayakers came by from
Sunnyside Beach
(SW of Tacoma) confirmed they saw it. -Carolyn Adams
