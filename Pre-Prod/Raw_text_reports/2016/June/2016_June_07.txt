============================================================

Entry 1:
Matriarch of the southern residents,
J2 Granny, L87 Onyx near Point Roberts
. He travels with J pod, primarily by J2's side. Water was a little rough but orcas really active! -Bob Mepham
*

4:41 p.m. - huge arch into a dive (definitely a humpback!).
Line of sight is between Point No Point and North Edmonds. Like last night it seems to be again heading towards Scatchet Head.

4:18 p.m. - whale blow (likely humpback) south east of Point No Point
east of shipping lane - looking to be heading northerly! -Stu Davidson
*

2:45 p.m. - Humpback rolling and feeding about a mile out from Kingston ferry dock
. On the ferry heading west and Captain even slowed it down so we could watch for a few minutes. -Chris Beamer Otterson
*

10:45 a.m. - From Edmonds marina beach
watched the humpback dive just north of
Kingston ferry dock
, underside fluke towards me....underside fluke is all white and gorgeous! Way too far a distance for any photo or ID, hopefully someone got one. I left shortly after.

10:30 a.m. - humpback is just hanging around general area around Kingston ferry dock
. Currently in front of it. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

9:38 a.m. - At Kingston now
. Watched him slapping his fin and fluke and breaching! -Cheryl Smith
*

9:15 a.m. -
Tony Woelke just called again.
Humpback is between Kingston Ferry dock and Apple Tree Pt
to the north very surface active. Spyhops, breaches, pec slaps.

7:35 a.m.
- Tony Woelke, WSF, aboard the Walla Wall called to report a
humpback approx. 800 feet off Kingston
traveling southbound at about
7:30 a.m. White under-fluke was noted.
*
Got a call from Cathy Niederhauser to report seeing
3, or possibly 5, killer whale about 1,000-1500' from shore at Depoe Bay OR, around 5-6 pm
. just circling around.
*

05:15 PM - Two orcas -
My wife and I were watching the seals on
Cobble Beach on the Oregon coast
, when I noticed a large dorsal fin and then spout in front of me. I thought it was a porpoise at first, but then it skimmed the surface and I could see the head was much larger and the
dorsal was maybe 4-5 feet from water to tip
. Then my wife spotted another one as it peeked up out of the water to look at the seals on the little islands/rock formations in the channel. We watched them circle one more time before they went out to sea again. We were probably 50 yards from seeing the first whale. They were definitely
orcas
. We couldn't get a picture to turn out unfortunately. The dorsals blended in with the black rocks. Looked like they were hunting the seals in the shallows.
