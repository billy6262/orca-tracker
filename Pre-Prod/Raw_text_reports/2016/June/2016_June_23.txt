At

6:15 PM
I lived out a dream of mine - seeing whales from the houseboat where I live in Friday Harbor!
4 whales present, and at least 3 of them came inside Brown Island
. As they swam past Friday Harbor itself I headed over to the University of Washington Friday Harbor Labs where I saw them again as they
made their way north up San Juan Channel

T73A's went through Shipyard Cove, around Brown Island, and through Friday Harbor this evening

With reports of transient orcas near Victoria, Mystic Sea left port in good time to spot
half-a-dozen whales near Discovery Island
, before coming across
at least two more orcas off Middle Bank
, including 18-year old
T49C
sporting a distinctive notched dorsal fin. The whales were mixing and matching with four whales traveling in a tight group at one point, and a lively calf keeping tight tabs on Mom. Pacific Harbor seals basking on the rocks and many different varieties of birds, including rhinoceros auklets, pigeon guillemots, oyster-catchers and bald eagles, made this wildlife trip yet another wonderful day to remember. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

9:16 p.m. - A humpback? just headed North under the Narrows bridge
! -Karen Caldwell
*

8:05 p.m. - Just saw a gray or humpback off Sunnyside Beach Park (Steilacoom).
Traveling north towards the Narrows, somewhat slowly but without dawdling. Doesn't appear to be feeding or diving deep. Didn't get much of a look at its back, and no fluke. Appeared to be staying shallow. Saw several blows as it passed by, fairly far apart in time and distance. -Tari Poe Norris
