Orca Sightings for October 27, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
November 4 - Received
3:52 p.m. -
Last Thursday, 27 Oct 16, I noticed there was a
single gray or humpback whale
outside of where I work. He/she has been to the
East of Smith Island
cruising up and down along
NAS Whidbey Island
. We have seen it every day for the last eight days and he hasn't traveled more than two to five miles up and down the coast. It seems unusual that it hasn't moved on and it's not in a pod. I have worked here for two years and usually the whales just pass through if we see them at all. At first it was great to see it, but now we are worried. The crab pots were here, and we don't want him to be tangled. Our address at work is 3675 W Lexington St, Oak Harbor WA 98278. Our Latitude 48.3434 Ã‚ and Longitude -122.6814 is for my work. My guess is, it is between 200 and 400 yards off base. If someone could check it out, that would be great. -Sandy Mattingly

Approx
1:20 p.m. - I saw him/her at Dalco Pass
... Lots of jumps! We went back to the beach, I'm obsessed with this
Humpback
! This time he/she wasn't doing much, I was getting a little worried. I think it was having a nap. Then, a boat went zooming past, I'm sure the people on board didn't even notice. After the boat went past He/she jumped out of the water about 5x!!! (photo below) BEAUTIFUL, the sound was incredible and so indescribable! -Desiree Sauve

11:37 a.m. -
Also, it's closer to the
Gig Harbor
viewpoint (I can hear it blow) but stick with Dalco- you can't get close enough to the water to see it at the Gig Harbor point.

I observed the whale from on the water this morning moving north and south (back and forth) in the center area of the Dalco/ Narrows/ Colvos Passages (the area between
Point Defiance, Gig Harbor and Vashon Island)
. Slow surface rolls and breathing followed by dives. Same patterns I've seen the last several days. Was paddling and did not manage to get any good fluke shots. But a good size and healthy looking whale. -Dean Burke
