Orca Sightings for July 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas spotted in Birch Bay and Cherry Point at

6:50pm. We were heading back to Semiahmoo from Sucia Island and spotted 2 orcas far away just off Cherry Point
. One came up face first from the water. Then just minutes later we were making a beeline across the mouth of Birch Bay and saw 2 more way over to the NE, towards BB Village. I took a right angle course away from them directly West, however it took them what seemed like seconds to come right at us. One came straight at us and I believe went under the boat. Several times they came out face first and everyone in the back saw them come almost completely out of the water lengthwise, maybe 50 feet from us while I idled helplessly in a bit of a panic. -David Johnson
