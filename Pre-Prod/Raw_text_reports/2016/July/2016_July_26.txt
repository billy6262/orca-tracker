Orca Sightings for July 26, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca passing by Mayne Island through Active Pass
in front of Laura Point heading north. -Stephen Peers
*
J17s foraging at False Bay, Doublestuf J34 and his Mum Oreo J22 foraging Pile Point. J31 breaching, J14s slow North, Blackberry J27 and his brother Mako J39 foraging near Lime Kiln Point Lighthouse. Group B of the Js plus the J14s all fishing in loose groups on the West side
as we sailed around the island. We're hoping they're finding enough Chinook salmon to sustain their families. A summers day family sail returning by way of Spieden and Flattop draped in evening light with sunset in San Juan Channel. -Barbara & David

One just never knows what wildlife we may see out on one of our excursions. We received word that some resident orcas trickled back into the area Sunday night, but they proved to be elusive on Monday. Today, however, they were back in good force! Captain Eric started this sunny, blustery day cruising towards
Salmon Bank, where we caught up with several small groups of orcas spread out near there, Eagle Point, and False Bay
. In total we estimate seeing between
10 and 12 members of J-pod
near these points. While we haven't made a positive ID yet, we believe one of the residents may have been bull J34, also known as Doublestuf. There were also a couple calves and several females. Passengers watched in awe as 2 breaches were done nearby. -Amy W
