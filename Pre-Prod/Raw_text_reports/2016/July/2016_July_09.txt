Entry 2:
8:10 p.m.
I have watched for the last 90 minutes the
Common Dolphins at Boston Harbor...Zangle Cove
...and back again. Back and forth. Very active along with lots of "feeding" activity. Done for the night. The rain is too heavy to follow from across the bay.

5:30 p.m. - Common Dolphins have been in Budd/Eld inlets
most of today. -Kim Merriman
