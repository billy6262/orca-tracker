5:35 p.m. - Got Suttles at Hein playing with a neonate harbor porpoise. J49 was with her at first but J37 came in and seemed to almost collect him.
Like "do not do what your aunt is doing!" -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Today's encounter with
J pod. Approximately 2 miles north of Hein Bank we observed J40 playing with what appeared to be a dead harbor porpoise.
We heard on the radio that she had been playing with it for at least an hour.
J14 and J45 were close by
, as well as
at least 2 minke whales
right alongside of them. (see photo in Minke section) We left the whales at

6:30 and they were heading south spread out in loose groups
. What a day! -Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

12:25 p.m. - Orca pod
during ferry ride. We just saw about a dozen orcas during the ferry ride
from Anacortes to Friday Harbor
(San Juan Islands). There were several babies in the pod and one of them jumped out of the water! This was about 20 minutes into the one-hour ride. -Drew Chuppe
*
Such a joy to see
J-pod in the inland waters for the fourth consecutive day
after a somewhat prolonged absence... It was a short trip from the dock to
Rosario Strait, where J pod were southbound in Thatcher Pass
. The whales were actively feeding with some rapid porpoising in pursuit of prey, many powerful tail and pectoral fin slaps to stun their quarry, and an occasional spy-hop and breach. Little ones were keeping close tabs on Mom, swimming in her slipstream, the area of least resistance. It's all about family, and to see these whales in their close-knit groups and natural surroundings of the Pacific Northwest was a joy to behold. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist and Author

8:34 p.m. - Puget Sound -
great sight of (
humpback
) in the sunset! Might be the same one I've seen (spotty) each of the last couple mornings?!

. While eating dinner at Antony's off the outside patio saw a huge whale blow! -Stu Davidson
