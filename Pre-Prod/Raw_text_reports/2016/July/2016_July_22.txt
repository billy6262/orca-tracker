Entry 1:
When we reached the south side of the island (San Juan) we found
parts of our resident J and L pods
. First spotted where
L41 (Mega) and L85 (Mystery)
, both large males. After spending some time with this group, we turned our eyes closer inshore where members of J-pod were swimming. Some of these identified whales include
J28 (Polaris) and a calf known as Notch (J47)
for a notch in his fin....- Amy W., Mystic Sea

Orcas were seen off the Friday Harbour - Anacortes
6:30pm ferry. The pictures I got were much too far away to glean any valuable information from, but does someone know who these whales were? There were a couple of whale-watching vessels with them. There looked to be about 4 individuals - at least one with a taller broader fin. They were porpoising quickly towards the Strait at

6:49pm, I believe along the coast of Lopez
just before the ferry entered the channel between Shaw and Lopez. I was guessing they were transients from what I observed and their behaviour, but they were too far away to confirm. -Elizabeth Zwamborn
*
I didn't see anything on
3:00 crossing except a couple of harbor porpoises and seals. Ferry worker in
Clinton agreed humpback. He saw it about noon
. -Debbie Stewart
*
No photo, but can confirm it was
a humpback
. Saw the dorsal fin. 2 spouts and a long full body glide above the surface. On a sailboat motoring past the
southern end of Whidbey Island into Possession Sound about
1:20 pm
. -Elaine Armantrout
*
The Kittitas was departing Clinton at approximately 1230 hours today
July 22 when they noticed a gray whale (reported as gray but confirmed by others as
humpback
)
1/4 mile due east of the Clinton terminal dock
. Apparently, the whale performed approximately 25 tail slaps and submerged. No other identifying marks could be seen." -John Rogstad, WSF
*
Received 2 reports of a Gray? Whale at the Clinton ferry dock. (later confirmed
Humpback
) First report at
6 am
from WSF, 2nd report at

1:05
from Debbie Friel, saying it was just yards off ferry dock tail slapping for 5 minutes.
