Trip report - It was a magical day today as we found
J-pod whales
a half hour from port!! We connected with many of these amazing icons by Decatur Island, very spread out, traveling slowly southbound (the
J22s, J16s and J17s
). Many of the group passed close to shore by
Burrows Lighthouse
, continuing south
past Deception Pass
and thrilling beach goers at Deception Pass State Pass. We took a sight-seeing trip under Deception Pass Bridge, and when back in Rosario Strait we headed to see yet more whales - near Colville Island on the south end of Lopez Island. Here we found our favorite lady
J-2 Granny with more members of her pod
! It's always a good day when we see Granny, estimated to be over 100 yrs of age. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

I was finally able to reunite with
most of Jpod off the west side of San Juan Island
. It had been over two months since I had seen them. Here was the first playful group we caught up with--Echo
(J42), Moby (J44), Star (J46), and J53
were busy socializing and playing together. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

*
Not about orcas, but had to share anyway! Had an amazing encounter with P
optart, BCX0324 Big Momma's 2016 calf
(

Entry 3:
due north from Port Angeles
. He decided to go on a breach-a-palooza, popping off 100+ breaches and/or chin slaps, and threw in a few tail throws for good measure. I'm not exaggerating, we all lost count after about 30, and even had to leave for a while to get out of the way of a military vessel and he was still at it when we reconnected. It was an unbelievable experience. -Carrie Sapp

One of the many common dolphin. Near Boston Harbor, Olympia
. -Chris Hamilton,
