Message from WA State Ferries

5:30 am this morning, reporting a whale in the middle of the traffic lanes outside Elliott Bay

likely was one of the humpbacks
that has been hanging around)

I am writing to report sighting a pod of about
12
bottle nose dolphins (
probably the Common dolphins
) near Devils Head at about
5 PM

July 29th they appeared to be feeding and very active, we were traveling by boat to Narrows Marina for dinner at the time, later on our return to Olympia we sited them again near Toliva Shoal about the same number 12 seemed to be actively feeding. I know what Harbor and Dall's porpoise look like these were clearly different gray with a bottle nose and the first I have ever observed in Puget Sound. -Larry Cowan
