Orca Sightings for July 23, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:00 a.m. - some of L & J Pod feeding off Sooke, L55 Nugget
slowly heading west towards the Pacific after spending time inland with other J and L pod members. Allen from Pizzability was fishing and helped us to be first on scene 12 min. from our dock! -Paul Pudwell

The
fin whale was hanging out with about 20 humpbacks off Port Angeles all day today
. Here it is surfacing right at our stern this afternoon. The white counter shading on the right side of the lower jaw is visible. I was able to see it's entire length as it cruised by just under the surface. It's at least 60 feet long and maybe a bit more than that. -James Grehsam
*

8:20 p.m. - Puget Sound -
Pretty confident it's a
Humpback
. Last saw it mid channel off West Point still heading North.

7:45 p.m. - Alki beach
. Spotted either
a humpback or gray whale
not too far off the beach. Huge spouts!! north bound. -Charle Vendley
*
Late report--at

3:30pm there was a single humpback just north of the mouth of Gig Harbor
that breached very close to shore and then travelled quickly north up Colvos Passage. -Michele Riley Campbell
*
Whales Port Ludlow/south Marrowstone Island area
- We have a summer home on Whidbey Island--North Mutiny Bay, just south of the Condos off Shore Meadows Rd. Saturday evening, maybe around

6:00
...my husband came to inform me he was seeing
numerous whale blowings
, one after the other. Approx 10 minutes later they were still in the bay heading north, but clear across from us. I saw very high blows from two whale--probably about a minute apart. These were
not killer whales
, we have seen them up close and personal, but something much larger! The Victoria Clipper heading back to Seattle had slowed to let their passengers observe them. -Sherri Hedman
*
Single humpback seen just after
2:00pm off the ferry in Admiralty Bay
. -Elizabeth Zwanborn
*
Smoke on the water. Aboard the Peregrine we encountered
a gray whale in Boundary Pass on the evening
trip so this was approximately

5:30 PM
. The encounter was amazing but left us wondering why is it here now? We coined it Lazy Fluke because even though the pattern of several blows followed by a deep dive was normal we were unable to get a really good fluke shot. Hopefully someone from another vantage point on another boat can get an ID shot to Cascadia - I won't know for sure until pics are on laptop but don't believe I got anything useful. -Debbie Stewart
*

6:00 p.m. - Common dolphins off North Harstine Island
again. (They could have been porpoises, it was hard to tell.) Last seen heading south. -Connor O'Brien
*

5:30 p.m. - Watching what we believe are common dolphins off Sunnyside Beach near Steilacoom
. Appear to be a little closer to McNeill. Moving south, but currently milling about and appear to be feeding. Too far from shore for a picture. -Tari Poe Norris
