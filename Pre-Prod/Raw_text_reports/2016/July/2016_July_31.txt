Orca Sightings for July 31, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a fun visit from
1-1/2 year-old J50, Scarlet
, today. She came over to check out our hydrophone that was dangling by the boat which we were using to listen to her family vocalizing! Eye contact once again. Magic. -Barbara Bender
*
Nothing but whales and water -
L47 Marina and her son L115 Mystic off Land Bank
this afternoon.nd

4:30 p.m. - Some of L47s and L26s just came back southbound past Land Bank
, didn't know they were north of us.

3:34 p.m. - Boats are spread from Hannah to Salmon Bank up to 2 mi offshore
trending west.

1:48 p.m. - Whales did flip before Lime Kiln, went west then south presumably to join up with others who look northbound off American Camp
now. -Monika Wiela
*

12:30 p.m. - L Pod is at Salmon Bank (L-92, L-83, L-110)
spread out and apparently foraging with some success. All boats doing a great job of observing from a respectful distance, happy to report. -Steve Smith

J-19 "Shachi" breaching in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. -Carrie Sapp
*
It's been an incredible past couple of weeks on the water. Yesterday,
July 31st, we saw
members of the L4 and L47 matrilines socializing with J pod
. They were engaging in tactile behavior all day with periods of forging in between. In the evening the
Ls were heading west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca
, seemingly heading for the Pacific. We shall see who's around today! It was definitely nice to see some of L pod again. Now if only K pod would come back ...-Heather MacIntyre
*
0902 a.m. - 6-7 orcas (including 1 adult male - 6 foot dorsal) in Rosario Strait
, seen west side of Deception Pass, close to Whidbey side. Traveling southbound directionally towards Port Townsend. Some breaching. -Eric Adams
*
0849 - Orcas west of Rosario Beach
, Anacortes. While visiting Rosario beach today my family and friends spotted multiple Orcas. One in particular with a baby. They were very active for about 30 minutes before heading towards Oak Harbor. -Shannon Conley
*

8:30 p.m. - 6+ orcas (Bigg's killer whales (Transients)) off Pender
. Tonight just before sunset we sighted a small group of orcas,maybe approximately 6 individuals (including1-2males)
off Theives Bay
. They were pretty far offshore traveling but then they backtracked. Then they appeared to stop and go into a resting pattern, with a few forming a resting line at times. That was very cool to see, a behaviour I have not had the privilege to see before! Beautiful orca sunset! -Jana Johnson
*
The first time I saw it I could've sworn I also saw
a bigger orca - like dorsal surfacing with the Fin whale
. I only saw it once... (observing from south of Bush Point when whales in Admiralty Inlet prior to Stus's sighting) -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*
Fin whale
- I had / have the exact same experience / reaction to believing there was an Orca too... I've seen enough orcas now to know it had to be one, versus a humpback or the Fin! And the behavior of the sea lion was classic of when a transient is nearby! My little video is posting now.

8:10 p.m. - reason I saw the Fin whale
.. Was cause I believed I saw a single huge dorsal of an Orca. I watched the Fin go by, now I see the huge dorsal again seemingly paralleling the Fin whale - both now south of Edmonds ferry terminal and slowly south bound.

7:58 p.m. -
looks to have turned more toward a easterly (towards
Edmonds Waterfront
dog park)

7:54 p.m. - the "fin" whale
is just north of
Edmonds Kingston ferry route
-- more on the Edmonds side heading south. Huge rounded arches and dives.. No fluke. -Stu Davidson
*
The first time I saw it I could've sworn I also saw
a bigger orca - like dorsal surfacing with the Fin whale.
I only saw it once, then wondered if it may have been the tip of its fluke, but it had just surfaced so don't see how that could be (unless it has a calf traveling with it which would be way too much to hope for!). But that is what made me look twice, and when I saw the dorsal on the whale again it was larger than a humpback, but not the larger triangular shaped thing I saw the first time. Maybe it was an orca chasing it, and that's why it was moving so fast?!

5:38 p.m. -
We just saw it
south of Bush Pt, approaching Hansville
. We are looking through our "big eyes" (thanks to Center for Whale Research), and after repeated observations by both of us, we believe this isn't a humpback and is possibly/most likely a
Fin whale!
We have not seen it fluke, the fin does not look like a humpback, but the blow is more visible than a Minke's blow, and the fin is way back on this whale. It is traveling quite quickly continuing SE. Don't think we can get a photo from this distance, it is quite far south now - but if anyone is at Point no Point or can get there soon, we would LOVE a photo to confirm species on this whale! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

4:47 p.m. - Just passed Bush Point headed south
. -Gregory Roeben
*

2:00 p.m. -
humpback (turned out to be
a fin whale) SE bound into Admiralty Inlet
. Viewing from Fort Ebey - been watching for awhile travel in from the west. Appears to be mid channel and traveling steadily. -Rachel Haight
*
We saw what we took to be
a humpback, but what could have easily be a fin whale in Admiralty Inlet evening
of
July 31st probably around
5 pm
, maybe earlier. We were fishing and not paying a lot of attention to time. It was moving south toward Bush Point about mid-channel. (Was the fin whale- see our
August 1st Sightings Report). -Glenn Barnett
