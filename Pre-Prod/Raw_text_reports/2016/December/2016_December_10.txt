Orca Sightings for December 10, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:30 PM - I found J Pod and L87 Onyx in San Juan Channel going East
. Pretty sure I saw J2, but the weather deteriorated quickly after I found them in-between the Cactus Islands, which concerned me, maybe they were taking a break from the 3'-4' waves... In 16 years I have never seen them in there, hope all is well with them. -Hobbes Buchanan
