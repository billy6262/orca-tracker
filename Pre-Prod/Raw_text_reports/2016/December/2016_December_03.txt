Orca Sightings for December 3, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J27 and other J pod members
tucked in close to one another for at least this part of their northbound travels up
Admiralty Inlet
. -James Gresham
*

4:29 p.m. - They are much closer to Marrowstone than Whidbey
at this point, especially the leaders.

3:45 p.m. - Visible from the south side of Lagoon Point
, Whidbey Island. Mid-channel south of Marrowstone Island. From my perspective on Whidbey, they are mid channel just a bit toward the Whidbey side from the mile market buoy, between the buoy and the southern end of marrowstone. Closer too marrowstone. -Margaret Marshall
*
Great afternoon with part of
J Pod, J16 Slick and her daughter J50 Scarlet
...The orca's passed Bush Point from around 3-4 pm with 3 of them close in. Most were mid channel and further over at Marrowstone Island side. -Marilyn Armbruster,

Entry 2:
*
After one of those slightly surreal treks along Whidbey's back roads only to find the Southern Residents were always just out of sight around the bluff, we eventually caught up with the
leaders in Mutiny Bay
. At least five whales were together at one time, milling and tail-slapping, and not in any particular hurry. It seemed an interminable wait at
Bush Point
before the whales (came by, but our patience and that of fellow frozen Orca Dorks (Marilyn Armbruster and Jill Hein) was amply rewarded with
three of the J16's
passing close to shore. As the light faded the orcas were still heading in a northerly direction. -Sandra Pollard
*

3:14 p.m. - Pod of 4-5 off old Beach Road, Mutiny Bay
. -Nancy M Hnat
*

3:09 p.m. -
Went to south Lagoon Point beach and found them again. Still by
Bush Point
. -Patricia Prochaska
*

2:15 p.m. - mid-channel, about 1 mile so. of Bush Pt/Whidbey side
, approaching Foulweather Bluff/entrance to Hood Canal/Kitsap side (sightline), closer to Whidbey. Lots of tail lobbing, splashing and feeding behavior but still heading north at a fairly steady pace. This is Susan posting, have to go work at the Langley Whale Center soon, but what a blessing to see them in front of our ON headquarters! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

2:04 p.m. - North bound
still. Closer to the Kitsap side.
South of Bush Point
. Danielle Pennington
*

1:44 p.m. - They just passed Double Bluff northbound
. -Jean Watson Manis
*

1:27 p.m. -
last report from me... they're at
Mutiny Bay
as seen from Point No Point. Closer to Whidbey now. Island explorer is still with them. Big splashes over there.

12:48 p.m. - currently northbound between Point No Point and Useless Bay
, headed toward Double Bluff. -Michelle Goll
*
We spent time with J
Pod group B (J11's, 17's and 22') and L87 Onyx in Admiralty Inlet
today. Several of the whales made a bee line right to the boat as soon as we got on scene. We spent much of the encounter today drifting with engines off. It was great seeing them but also sad with the glaring absence of recently deceased J28 and J54. Seeing
J46 Star
, J28's oldest calf swimming with her aunt
J35 Tahlequah
was both heart warming and heart breaking. I hope Star is ok. The whales were foraging very actively and there seemed to be plenty of salmon around which is a good thing.

12:55 p.m. - The outside group are the J16's. J22's and at least J27
inside. Need confirm the rest. (Currently) Just below Point No Point.

12:46 p.m. - Confirm 2 groups.
We"re moving to the western group. -James Gresham
*

12:49 p.m. -
Found another part of
J pod off Hansville
, Kitsap Peninsula.
J27 Blackberry
is one. -Carol Knight,

12:45 p.m. -
They are definitely heading north now.

12:35 p.m. -
I was watching another smaller group north of that. I haven't seen the more north group in a while. Maybe they turned south a met up. -Danielle Pennington
*

12:44 p.m. -
Marilyn called again with update: orcas were going north, around the point not too far out and also across the water over toward
Useless Bay
.

12:30 p.m. -
Marilyn DeRoy called from
Point no Point
to report seeing 7 - 8 orcas, perhaps starting to head back south.

12:36 p.m. -
Looks to be heading towards us at
Point No Point
. -Elyse Solitto
*

12:28 p.m. -
From high bluff Stamm overlook in Edmonds I could see beautiful line of
at least 8-10 dorsals all southbound east of Point No Point
. Pod is on Kitsap side of mid channel.

12:15 p.m. - there may be 2 groups
(or just different angles). And/ or I'm Seeing a baleen whale. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

12:27 p.m. - Mid channel closer to Point No Point. Southbound now. J's
. -James Greshamn
*

12:14 a.m. - I am at Point no point
and finally found them. They are south of Whidbey and seem to be slowly circling as first they were headed south and not north. Large male is still headed south. -MIchelle Goll

I am seeing blows
mid Sound
well east of where you (Danielle Pennington) dropped pin on map photo. -Alisa lemire Brooks

12:11 p.m. - They are passing Point No Point
. There is a large yellow channel marker. They are northwest of it. ...'m seeing a very large male up here north of the buoy. Must be spread out.

This is where I am seeing them. (map indicates
1 mile southeast of Point No Point
) ...Very close to the Kitsap side.

Maxwelton beach
(Whidbey) heading north. They are way on the other side. -Danielle Pennington

Vessel Spokane reports
12 or more Orca whales
sighted. Full grown and babies. Heading
Northbound to Kingston
. -Donna Wharton, WS Ferries
*

8:30 a.m. - Saw 2 humpbacks off the coast of Victoria
, there might be one or two others as I saw what agitated to be several spouts in the distance but can't be sure. They were foraging in one area for awhile, then a tanker started up and moved their way and they moved out of there quickly. -Mariann Carrasco
*
Gray whale 723, Saturday in Admiralty Inlet west of Point No Point
. We were headed back to Seattle after visiting with members of J Pod when a baleen whale was spotted in the distance. It turned out to be 723 known as Lucy or Lucy-fer. 723 is a member of the Saratoga Passage gray whales, a group of about a dozen who for many years have stopped by Puget Sound in the spring for a couple months of feeding in the waters of Saratoga Passage and Possession Sound while on their northward migration. For whatever reason it appears that 723 decided to stick around this year as he has occasionally been sighted all through this past summer and fall. Here he is surprising us by surfacing right at the bow of Island Explorer 3. -James Gresham,

Entry 4:
