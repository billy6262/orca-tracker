(
Orcas on both sides of Whidbey Island today. Saratoga whales were ID'd as residents, but this Admiralty Inlet group was too far for IDs. Js and Ks may have split from yesterday.
) We received a message from Sarah MacDougal, who received a text from friends who were on the
Pt Townsend/Coupeville ferry and saw a pod of orcas at
4:15 pm
.

Had to stop at
Fort Casey - and watched at least 8 whales foraging
but trending northbound -- VERY spread out -between Ft. Casey and Fort Flagler. Some beautiful backlit blows - too far away for photos/ID's. Left them at
