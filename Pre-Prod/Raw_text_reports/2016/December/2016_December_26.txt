Video by John Basterfield of
T77A and T49A2 in Victoria Harbor
shared on Victoria Buzz Facebook page: We have obtained video showing two transient killer whales spotted on the inside of the breakwater on Boxing Day. John Basterfield captured the video, and he tells Victoria Buzz, "we saw them out by the light beacon from a distance, but by the time we got there, there was no sign of them. Walking back toward the Pilot Boats' basin we saw them heading out. A real gift."
