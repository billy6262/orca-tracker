noon
, watching through our "Big Eyes" (thanks to the Center for Whale Research!), I can see
spouts from beyond Point no Point to the south
, all the way up to just south of Pt. Wells, Edmonds (which is as far north as we can see). It appears to me the spouts seem to be moving north, but at this distance it is difficult to tell for sure. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

I left
Point No Point at
11:50 am
, after seeing 3 males traveling fast
southbound from Whidbey/Doublebluff towards Edmonds

11:45 a.m. - I saw one circle back but then cruise south again at a pretty good clip, out in front of Point No Point

, closer to the Whidbey Island shore, headed south toward Bush Point. Called in by Wayne Sedgrick (sp?).
*

9:28 a.m. - Unidentified killer whale
- Just saw what I believe is an Orca carrying a seal. Live on
Mutiny Bay
. Orca heading north toward Admiralty inlet. Just moved here so not sure. Black fin had notches in it. The Seals tail was in the air. Dorsal fin was visible on Orca and every once in awhile Seals head would appear. Wish I had taken a photo but ran out with only binoculars. (
This report of an orca with a seal is at the same time residents were in the general area. Leaving open the possibility a single (or pod of) Bigg's may have been ahead of them or possibly Sea Lion thermoregulating - ALB
) -Nancy M Hnat
