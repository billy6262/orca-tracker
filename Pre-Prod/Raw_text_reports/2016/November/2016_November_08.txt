Orca Sightings for November 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:57 p.m. -
We just saw a whale! We were taking the main down and saw/heard the blow. He has surfaced several times since then-we saw his back twice. Right now, he seems to be parallel with us. Too far away for photos, unfortunately-we stopped the boat and are sitting here-
east of Hat Island in Possession Sound
. Wow! That was exciting and unexpected! We are
pretty sure it's a humpback
. We haven't seen him on a few minutes, so we are going to head back to the Marina. How cool is that?! We are sailing-5.7 knots with jib only. At one point, we think he was only a few hundred yards from our boat. We first saw him around
3:40, heading south. -Sharon Ann Clark
