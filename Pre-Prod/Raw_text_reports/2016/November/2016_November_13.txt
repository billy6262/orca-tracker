Hi we were able to spot some orcas or what we thought were orcas while flying into SeaTac a few minutes ago. They were just
north of Blake island

3:58 p.m. -
And now they are heading south again. Back in front of
Possession Point

They've turned again and heading north toward ferry lanes. Amazing! So active! So many breaches today while watching from shore at
Possession Beach on Whidbey Island
. -Dori Dace

Tight group of Southern Resident orcas in a resting line battling strong winds and seas off
Possession Park, Whidbey Island
. -Sandra Pollard

3:30 p.m. -
Beautiful beautiful resting lines. Pods are grouped togther in a big beautiful tight resting line with at least 3 little ones and one sub pod of 4 just few hundred yards ahead. They kept a steady slow sleepy pace (with occasional tail slaps) down the Sound and are now West of mid channel south of
Glendale, Whidbeyheading towards Possession Point
. That's where I must leave and take my eyes off them. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

3:15p.m

steady southbound, group more west of mid channel with some individuals close but further east and ahead. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

2:45 p.m. - Pod of Orcas near the Clinton/ Mukilteo Ferry
. They were generally headed south, on the Clinton side. It was hard to tell how many there were, it's pretty choppy. They were traveling slow. I saw at least a couple males, females and I believe at least one little one. I couldn't tell if it was one large pod that was separated or if they were circling, possibly feeding. They were having no troubles navigating between the ferries and would sneak pretty close to the side of us! -Michelle Booker

J and K pod

1:40 p.m. -
The female and a couple others have stalled and are
foraging northeast of Mukilteo ferry dock

1:20 p.m. -
Fairly close pass female (possibly J19)
Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach
. She is continuing northeast around the ferry directionaly towards Port Gardner, with others spread across the channel steady northbound pace.

12:57 p.m. -
seeing a few off
north side Possession Point
...foraging. Also from reports and IA location looks like they are still spread from Possession Point and northward into Possession Sound, some trending northbound towards Clinton/ Mukilteo.

11:45 -
I've been at Ocean Ave see many whales
3 miles south of Scatchet
and just saw couple up towards
Haines Wharf Edmonds
! Mile offshore. Turning east. And male northbound directionally towards Mukilteo. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

11:30 a.m. - I saw another male and 3-4 females 2-3 miles offshore, NW of Edmonds
. The main group is no longer visible from my house, but I suspect they are probably off of Picnic Point now heading towards Mukilteo. Most of the orcas were less than a mile offshore, so I think they should be heading for Possession Sound and Saratoga Passage.

11:07 a.m. - many more than 4
, spread out between the ferry dock and well north of Sunset Ave N, some closer to shore and some up to a mile offshore. Saw at least 3 males and many females.

11:00 a.m. - 3 or 4 orcas just north of the Edmonds ferry dock
, a few hundred yards offshore, heading north. -Sherman Page
*

10:45 a.m. - Three orcas spotted from Marina Beach Park heading north to Point No Point.
On west side of channel. -Robyn Cartwright

10 orcas heading north off the Edmonds ferry dock
.
*

9:45 a.m. -
At least
a dozen Orcas sighted off Richmond Beach
moving north towards Edmonds. -Larry Murphy
*

7:30-
7:50 a.m. - orcas seen between the west end of Alki Beach promenade and Alki Point.
Adult and adolescent, possibly one more. Initially 50-100 yards from shore, gradually moving away from shore toward Magnolia, then diagonally toward Pier 91/Queen Anne. Exhibited what I would describe a feeding behavior - circling and roiling the water. -Kersti Muul
*

1:00 p.m. - Sunday, Deception Pass State Park (West Beach), Gray Whale
surfaced several times for about ten minutes near shore (approximately 100 yards). Multiple eyewitnesses. Seemed to wander somewhat. Probably feeding. -Darin Christen
