I just got a call from a friend who was on the
Kingston ferry

a large pod of at least 8 Orcas
blowing. Also a large male and a female with a very small baby along her side. It looked very small...possibly a newborn calf? -Jann Clare

2:20 - dozen plus more orcas spread mid channel from Eglon, Kitsap/Edmonds and north to triangle of Point No Point/ South Whidbey/Edmonds
. All still trending slowly northbound.

2:10 p.m. - the group off Edmonds has angled NW
directionally towards Admiralty Inlet, middle of the channel few miles south of Possession Point, South Whidbey with NOAA boat nearby collecting fecal samples. Still hard to say which way they'll commit at least for this group.

saw a large splash as from a breach east of midchannel due west of Constellation Park (
