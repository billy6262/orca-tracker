============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient male (probably T137A) launching into full breach while exiting Saratoga Passage into Possession Sound
. As seen from bluffs above Sandy Point, Whidbey Island. -Marilyn Armbruster

I took some incredible photos of
T137s
today...first time I have captured a breach. it took my breathe away. I love watching orcas from shore, something about it, it's just so natural... first saw them from across the street as it looked like
they came as far north to Baby Island
and turned around again to go back south to Langley.... around

11:45 am
. they showed up out here. Then I couldn't stand it,
had to follow them to Langley
where I lost track of them after hitting up Sandy Point, but I was surely orca blessed today...with some orca healing.

1:10 p.m. - They have passed Sandy Point and are heading towards Clinton.

12:40 p.m. - Orcas nearing Langley heading southeast mid channel
. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

10:45 p.m. - 4 off Langley, headed north, closer to Whidbey side.
-Brian Berry
*

9:38 a.m. - orcas right in front of Clinton ferry dock
. I only saw two, but suspect it the same T's from yesterday? No real direction, but appeared to be angling toward Saratoga. -Dori Dace
*

9:30 a.m. -
Fred Lundahl reports seeing
a small pod of orcas in the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry lane
, just lollygagging, no direction of travel.
*
WA State Ferries reports seeing
2 orcas, one an adult male, in the Clinton ferry lane at 9 AM
.
*

2:00 p.m. - Saw two whales surfacing just about 75-100 yards off of Browns Point Lighthouse Park in Tacoma
around 2 pm today. They were
either humpbacks or grays
, we didn't get a good enough glimpse to know for sure. They seemed to be hanging around but slowly heading south! Made our day! -Sophi Perkins
