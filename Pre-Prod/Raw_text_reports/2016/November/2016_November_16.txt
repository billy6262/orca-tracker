Hello from Henry Island! I so enjoy your updates weekly! Thank you! Is this the right place to report whale sightings? If so my husband and I saw
at least 6 humpback whales off Spieden island on Wednesday
November 16th at
12:30 pm
. We were on our way to Roche Harbor when we saw them blow. We went to investigate and was amazed to see at least 6 humpback feeding over there and by Davidson Head. We lived in Maui for years so had no problem recognizing them. Stunning! Thank you again for your wonderful newsletters! -Dana zia
