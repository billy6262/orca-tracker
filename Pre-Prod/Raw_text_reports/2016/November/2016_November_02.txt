Orca Sightings for November 2, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:25 p.m. -
saw some splashes by a small boat.
Humpback just dove pointed SW in Dalco Passage
just out from the Point Defiance ferry dock. -Cathy Baker

Approx
1:20 p.m. - I saw him/her at Dalco Pass
... Lots of jumps! We went back to the beach, I'm obsessed with this
Humpback
! This time he/she wasn't doing much, I was getting a little worried. I think it was having a nap. Then, a boat went zooming past, I'm sure the people on board didn't even notice. After the boat went past He/she jumped out of the water about 5x!!! (photo below) BEAUTIFUL, the sound was incredible and so indescribable! -Desiree Sauve

11:37 a.m. -
Also, it's closer to the
Gig Harbor
viewpoint (I can hear it blow) but stick with Dalco- you can't get close enough to the water to see it at the Gig Harbor point.

11:07 a.m. -
Getting a lot of surface blows. Seems like a smaller whale but might be the height/distance.

10:59 a.m. - Humpback is back off Dalco
viewpoint, 5 mile drive, Point Defiance. Just saw a small fluke. -Danielle Vance
