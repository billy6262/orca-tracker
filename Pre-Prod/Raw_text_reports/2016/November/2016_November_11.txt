did see
humpback (or gray) mid channel south of Clinton/Mukilteo ferry docks
. Blow, surface, and dive in northerly direction, too far for species ID. Seen from bluff 2 miles south. (Note: moved to Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach and could not resight). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

I saw
a single Common Dolphin this morning from the
7:15 Coupeville ferry
. It was fairly close to Whidbey and headed northwest. Definitely not a Harbor Porpoise which we saw later in the voyage. -Steve Ellis
