Orca Sightings for January 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the afternoon I joined Eagle Wing's Serengeti with Dale Mitchell and we came across a group of
10 CA/U's west bound slightly east of Pillar Point
, 35 miles west of Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula. According to Jared Towers, " I have only seen this particular group of CA's/U's once before in outside waters several years ago during a Fisheries and Oceans survey off Cape St. James (southern tip of Haida Gwaii). They have never been photographed in the Salish Sea before." -Mark Malleson
ID Notes Re:
January 8th CA Ts and others. "That group should have included
8 CA transients
, from two groups which are have been regularly encountered seasonally off California for over 20 years - mostly in Monterey Bay, but also down in my area (near Los Angeles). They are the
CA140s (U105s)
- including a juvenile and small calf) - and female
CA40 (U104)
, with males
CA137 (U103) and CA163 (U106)
. Monterey Bay Whale Watch encountered them on 8
December 2015. There are also at least three whales with them that are not part of those CA Ts, that I do not readily recognize: the sprouter with the small nick near the tip of his narrowed dorsal fin (with CA137 in this photo), a (female?) with the narrow dorsal fin that has a tiny nick in the center, and another whale that looks like an adult female (no nicks).... The female in Mallard's image with the large single nick in the center of her dorsal fin is
CA140B (U105B)
. The female with the two large V-shaped notches in the center of her fin (looks like an "M") is
CA140 (U105)
. And the one with the new extensive rakes on the dorsal fin is
CA140C (U105C)
...I looked at naturalist Cory Mac's photos: the whales that she captured included
CA137, CA163 (U106), CA40 (U104), and the CA140s, Emma's (U105's) matriline
. " Very cool sighting! -Alisa Schulman-Janiger (California Killer Whale Project)

Eglon. We saw them first around 1100 am ish,
until we left after
2:30 pm. Good food in area from what we can tell. We were conducting other work on area nearby. Big group of California sea lions as well. -Toby Black
