============================================================

Entry 1:
About
3:00pm
. Saw
two maybe three orcas south Camano Island west side
. Second time I have seen orcas first time in my kayak. They where traveling south then came in close to shore maybe looking for something to eat. Picture was taken with a point and shoot water proof camera, south end of Camano Island west side just off shore of
Wilkes Gary Hts Road
. It is about a half mile up from the south tip of the Island. -Andrew Dillon
