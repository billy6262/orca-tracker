Orca Sightings for January 18, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Meet
J55
, the newest member of J pod, first documented by NOAA Researchers swimming alongside her/his family in Puget Sound. J55 makes the 6th new J calf and 9th overall calf born to the southern residents in the past 13 months. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC

New Southern Resident Killer Whale Calf Confirmed! We're excited to announce that NOAA Fisheries killer whale researchers documented
a new calf during a research survey with J pod
yesterday,
January 18, 2016, in Puget Sound. Using photos taken by the researchers, the Center for Whale Research confirmed this is a new calf, designated
J5
5. The calf was in
close proximity to both J14 and J37
, so we don't know who the mother is just yet, and it may take a few encounters before we know. The calf seems to be just a few days old and in good condition.
This good news comes with some sad news, however. On the same trip we observed
J31, a 20 year-old female who has never successfully calved, pushing around a deceased neonate calf
