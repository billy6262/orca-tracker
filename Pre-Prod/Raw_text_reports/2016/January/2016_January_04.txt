Orca Sightings for January 4, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
) found
K33
(and presumably the rest of K pod) at the
western entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. On the evening of the 4th the whales headed east into the Strait of Juan De Fuca and by the
afternoon of the 5th were headed up Haro Strait
(with J pod based on the calls on the San Juan Island hydrophones). They spent the
6th in the southern Strait of Georgia
and by this morning they were in the northern Strait of Georgia, an area that we have previously seen J pod to commonly frequent. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, NOAA-NWFSC 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

12 Noon - At least one humpback is waving its flukes around, just SE of Point No Point
, Kitsap Peninsula. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

10:40 a.m. -
Some
Porpoises feeding by Chambers Bay
. No Orcas or other large whales in the South Sound, so this will have to do... -Robert Storozyk

11:00 a.m. -
I saw
a couple orcas
aboard the Ganges Hawk. This was
about 11
. One had a large kinked dorsal fin, kinda wavy looking. The other was large as well but more straight. Very tall both. (outside
Fulford Harbor, Salt Spring Island, around Russell Island
. He said there were two adult males, one with a wavy dorsal fin. They were travelling SW.) -Lindsey Pattinson

12 noon - Saw two humpback off Eglon
today. Eglon being just south of Point No Point, maybe halfway to Kingston. -Donna Moreland

Entry 2:
We are continuing the satellite tagging project that we began in 2011 to help us understand where Southern Resident killer whales go in the winter, and thus their winter habitat use. Last Thursday afternoon,
31 December, we deployed a satellite-linked transmitter on an adult male, K33, in central Puget Sound
. The location data transmitted from this, and the previous tags we have deployed, tag will be key for NOAA Fisheries in our efforts to address the data gap in winter distribution identified in the Recovery Plan as well as provide information for the designation Critical Habitat in coastal waters. This project is a collaborative effort between the NWFSC, Cascadia Research Collective, and the University of Alaska, with supplemental funding provided by the U.S. Navy......The tag was deployed on K33 as K pod was traveling north out of Puget Sound on 31 December, 2015. By the Friday,
1 January, the whales had arrived at the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. They have remained in the area
between the entrance to the Strait and Swiftsure Bank
since then. An interesting aspect of them remaining in this area for the past several days may have to do with our observation that the K14 matriline was not with the rest of K pod during our encounter. However, on Saturday, the Center for Whale Research encountered J pod, with the K 14s, as they headed south in Haro Strait and then west toward the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca - likely to rejoin with K pod. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC, NOAA-NWFSC 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging
