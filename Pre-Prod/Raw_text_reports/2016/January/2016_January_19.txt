Update on the whereabouts of tagged killer whale K33 from Dr. Brad Hanson. On the morning of 15 January,
K33
(and likely the rest of K pod) was southbound and had just rounded
Cape Blanco in southern Oregon
. They continued south over the next two days reaching the southernmost extent of this coastal trip, just north of
Cape Mendocino near Arcata, California
, on the afternoon of 17 January. They reversed direction and for the last two days have retraced their route and as of this morning (19 January) had just passed Heceta Head on the central Oregon coast.

- I want to report a large and

(Phocoena phocoena) throughout South Puget Sound. I live on my sailboat and I am on the water all the time, and I see pods of Harbor Porpoise everywhere. This individual was photographed off Day Island and Fox Island, south of Narrows bridge, she/he was one in a pod
numbering about 15
