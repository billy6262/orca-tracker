Orca watchers, here's our latest update on the location of tagged whale
K33
: Our previous update
(12 January) found K33 (and likely the rest of K pod) just north of the Columbia River
, traveling south. They continued their southbound trek such that by mid-day
on the 13th they were off Depoe Bay, Oregon
. On the morning of the
14th they were nearing the Umpqua River
, an area we had followed L84 to last year during our winter cruise in late February (see 2015 blog). By this morning
(15 January) they had just rounded Cape Blanco in southern Oregon
. This southerly excursion in January is similar to what we observed in 2013 when we had K25 tagged. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFSC
