Orca Sightings for January 6, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:20-
3:35 p.m. -
Had the opportunity to use the high powered binoculars at Susan and Howies (south of Bush Point on Whidbey) to watch
at least 2 humpbacks
. The whales were around the southbound shipping lanes, east of
Point No Point
lobtailing, breaching, sounding...eventually moving on southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

11:30 a.m. -
from
Shore Meadows (north end Mutiny Bay
, Whidbey Island) I watched
several Harbor porpoise
(including 2 calves) about a mile out foraging back and forth. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

...After seeing a potential blow
between Saltspring Island and Prevost Island
, Morning Star headed south through Captain Pass. Soon, two male transient killer whales were spotted, heading northwest. These were photographed and identified as
T093 and T097
