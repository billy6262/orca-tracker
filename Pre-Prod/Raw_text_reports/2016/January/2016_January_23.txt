Orca Sightings for January 23, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
I want to report
what I think was a fin whale
sighting. I've done a lot of research and cannot find that it would be anything other than the fin whale. The color, length and serpentine-like shape tic all the boxes for a fin whale. It was sighted
by the lighthouse on Vashon Island
(Point Robinson) last weekend. Feeding and traveling. My friend and I saw the whale, light brown or light grey in color, long and serpentine in appearance, maybe 30 to 35 feet in length, and solitary. The length is a rough estimate of course. It came up a couple of times for air as it slithered along almost snake like, blowing spray from his (or her) blow hole, and then came up a third time and dove deeper, as its body rose up with greater undulation and disappeared. Maybe feeding? We didn't see it after that. -Celia Reno
My name is Tom. I am a friend of Celia's and I was with her when we sighted the whale from the eastside of Vashon Island. He was about 200 yards off shore. I've seen sea lions before and harbor seals, especially when I was living in Everett. I had a kayak and I would see them down by the Everett Waterfront. I know what we saw on the 23rd was nothing like those mammals. I've also seen Orcas in Puget Sound and Grey Whales and the whale we saw was different. This one was longer and its body undulated as it swam along. I saw it take a couple of breaths from his blow hole on top of his head and the spray, judging from distance, was about 7 to 8 feet high. He dove deeper after seemingly filling his lungs, and when he did dive below the undulations of his body (there were 2 or 3 bumps breaching the water) compressed more tightly so that I could see air between his body and the top of the water. If he had a dorsal fin it was smaller, certainly not the size of an Orca's dorsal fin. I don't recall seeing his fluke come out of the water when he disappeared. If it did it wasn't very dramatic. I just remember that he seemed long, almost snake like, and his coloring was light brown to grey. Hope this helps! -Tom Hodie
