Orca Sightings for January 20, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:00 p.m. -
They are
further north
now than I can see. I would think at least up around Kingston if they continued to head in that direction.

1:30 p.m. - two humpbacks west of mid channel northbound between Point Jefferson and President Point, Kingston

Saw a
grey whale today around
10:30 am
south sound. Southern tip of
Key Peninsula and Anderson Island
. Saw it blow a few times and tail once from about a mile or so away. That's McNeil Island in background looking north. Sorry no tail shots. Between Key Peninsula and Anderson Island. Posted it in the local Key peninsula group and a few responses said it's been in the area since at least last Sunday (
January 17). -James Lewis
