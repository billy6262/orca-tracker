Orca Sightings for February 26, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Wed, Feb 26 - We [Center for Whale Research] have been out on the water quite a bit in the last few days and, as a result, are busy preparing our photos and encounter summaries. We don't usually share our Encounters out of order, but this one is particularly interesting. Encounter #10 - Feb 26, 2020 -
J Pod
: "A few minutes later, we had a pair of harbor porpoise come directly over to our boat and then disappeared. Looking at our pictures later, one porpoise had fresh killer whale teeth marks on it (photo: harbor porpoise with tooth marks). Jeanne got photos from shore of this group and her photos clearly show at least one adult porpoise in the midst of the J pod whales. Some of the whales involved with the porpoise harassment were
J31, J56, J36, J47, and J49
..." See CWR Encounter #10 for full summary and more photos. -photo by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research -

Entry 3:
two males between the southern end of Lopez Island and Smith somewhere around
10:50
; watched for a bit as they made their way southeast toward Whidbey Island but were still well offshore. They were moving at about 5 knots consistently but were then sluggish as they surfaced for succession of breaths. Down times were clocked anywhere between 6-11 minutes, with the average being about 8 minutes. I can confirm by the dorsals that this is
T77A and T124C
. -Amanda Marie Colbert, Orca Network

09:40 -
Just saw
two male killer whales go through Cattle Pass

Wed, Feb 26 - "Spouting News" While, not as well known as early spring prognosticator Punxsutawney Phil; when Saratoga gray whales in these parts visit, we are encouraged spring is nearing.
Single gray spouted by this afternoon on a gorgeous calm day near Mariners' Cove, Whidbey Island

Hi- My first
Gray Whale
of the season! About

4:30 PM
spotted the familiar blow, just
south of Mabana
. Must have been tasty Ghost Shrimp as it stayed around quite a while, feeding on its side, swimming in circles. No ID as out a ways and looking directly into the sun. A flock of Scoter were also in the area. Add a pair of eagles talking in the big Firs down the bluff, a Bewicks Wren singing his heart out, a pair of Flicker chasing each other around the trees - it must be Spring! -Barbara Brock

16:00 (approx.) -
Good afternoon. At about
4:00 pm today,
two gray whales motored by Pebble Beach
on the west side of Camano Island, and stopped about a quarter mile north to feed, south of Summerland. Was such a joy to see them back! -Peg Boley, Pebble Beach

15:30 - It's off Blake [Island]
now.

15:23 - Resight half way between Bainbridge and Blake Island.
About 2 to 3 km out into the channel. Still southbound. Low bushy blows ... Didn't get a great view of the body. It's moving relatively fast and inconspicuously.

15:17 - I'm viewing from Magnolia
and lost it in the glare.

13:50 -
There is a
single gray whale [updated to two grays] feeding off SE corner of Hat Island
. They were both feeding in the same area - they were taking long dives so at first it was difficult to detect that it was 2 individuals. It wasn't until they came up on opposite sides of the boat one after the other that I realized I had two and not one.
FYI - they were very consistently staying up on what I would call the
Hat Island Bar
. They where crusing back and forth right about the 50ft depth mark and right along the edge of the Bar where it drops off into deeper water. -John Judy

12:45 -
Spouts off Tyee Beach about 400 yds right now. Deep diving...think it was a gray and it was
heading southwest towards Tulalip from Tyee Beach
. Deep diving so it was several minutes between seeing the spouts. I was out walking the beach so didn't have my drone to go see.
Another person saw
a gray off Tillicum Beach this morning heading toward Kayak
. -John C. Storbeck
