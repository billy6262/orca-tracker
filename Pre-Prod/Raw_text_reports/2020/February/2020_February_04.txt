Hello. I saw
a whale this morning in Puget Sound west of Blake Island
. I believe it was a
Humpback
. It was definitely not an orca. The color was brownish. My eye caught a water burst from the surface and a shape submerge and then re-emerge maybe 200 yards south. The brown body rose above the water as much as 4 feet and a large fin on the side of the whale was in view. Awesome! Did not see it surface again. The whale was heading
southbound
. (Viewed from Pritchard Rd E., Port Orchard). -James Cassani
