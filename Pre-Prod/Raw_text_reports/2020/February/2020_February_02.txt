Orca Sightings for February 2, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
14:49 - Baleen whale, possibly a humpback
, spotted traveling
southbound in Saratoga Passage
closer to the Whidbey side. Looks to be in travel mode, roughly three to four blows then the fluke goes up, and into a deep five-ish minute dive. We are located at
Indian beach on Camano Island
. After looking through binoculars we confirmed that it
was a humpback
