Orca Sightings for February 17, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
T99s and T137s
, had traveled to the lower entrance of
Plumper Sound
when Dave arrived on scene at 1405. The whales had been reported to have been doing a lot of milling and direction changes prior to arrival. About twenty minutes after Dave arrived the whales split into two groups with
T99, T99C, T99D, T137, and T137B moving on ahead while T99B, T137A, and T137D stopped to attack a harbor seal

The weather was too nice today not to get on the water, so we headed out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. Despite having no whale reports when we left the dock, Sara spotted the
T99s and T137s heading down Boundary Pass
. While we've heard whales on the hydrophones several times this year, this was our first behavioral encounter of 2020! It was great to catch up with
T137A Jack
, who late last summer was seen with a fairly severe peduncle injury causing him to swim slowly and awkwardly, often trailing well behind the rest of his family. From a behavior standpoint he seems to be back to normal, as not only was he right in with the group, but we saw him swimming at high speeds and also participate in a successful kill.
T137A Jack, T137B Tempest, T99 Bella, and T137 Loon."
