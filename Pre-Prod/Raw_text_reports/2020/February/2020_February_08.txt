14:07 - [orcas] Northbound Eagle Crest

Camano Island

Can confirm
T046's
. Just left Boy and Dog Park in
Langley
at
11:37am and had been taking photos; I have
T46D, T46E, and T46F
for sure. They were still
trending north
about mid channel but closer to Camano, longer down times. Saw a few Harbor porpoise out there so possible they were hunting. Just sent a group down from Langley Whale Center to see if they could find them! -Amanda Marie Colbert, Orca Network

10:43 -
Viewing from above Sandy Point near
Langley
. At least
3 Orcas
, Whidbey side, slowly heading north. Not much surface action. Could be in hunting mode. Glimpsed brief milling behavior before dorsals disappeared below surface.
"Yippee - orcas in north Puget Sound! The Orca call always gets the adrenaline rushing, but even more so when whales are round Whidbey Island. Following the Washington State ferry morning alert of
orcas seen north of Clinton heading toward Saratoga Passage
, we spotted three dorsal fins from the bluff above
Sandy Point, Langley
. The whales (later identified as
T046s
) were closer to the Whidbey side and appeared to be hunting. The initial sighting was brief as their dorsal fins rapidly disappeared below the surface, re-appearing a little further north later as they continued to circle and mill with the lead male logging for a while while the other two members of the pod caught up. The heavy showers didn't make for good photography conditions so apologies from Richard Snowberger for the fuzzy photos." -Sandra Pollard
*

10:28 - [orcas]
At least four passed
between Whidbey and Hat [Islands], closer to Hat
, moved quickly and milling
around Camano Head, Whidbey side
... looks like trending towards Langley but slowly. One other was following the main group at least 500 yards behind. They seem to have been all around the south tip of Camano but resolving up towards Langley now...Sean Nolan

09:18 -
Karen Graham called to report ~
4-6 orcas directly north of the Clinton ferry dock

orcas out in the middle of Liberty Bay
surfacing, big dorsal fins.
Probably 1/2 dozen, 6-8 maybe, right between Virginia Point and Lemolo Point
