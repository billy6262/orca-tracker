Orca Sightings for February 24, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mon, Feb - Center for Whale Research encounter with the
T18s, (T18 & T19C) plus T60D and T60E by Speiden Island
. See Center for Whale Research -

Entry 2:
14:10 - The gray whale is still milling Port Susan
per earlier location description, though is drifting SW as s/he does. Long dives and distance make resighting her/him somewhat difficult.

13:15 -
Caught very quick glimpse of gray whale who surfaced in
Port Susan, north of Kayak Point
, aimed southbound. Just now re-sighted...Gray is now toward mid channel milling NW of Kayak Point, sadly now too far for photos or ID at this time. Water glassy calm. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

15:33 -
Just sighted again mid channel
between south end of Hat Island and the river delta
.

09:30 -
Good morning, husband and riders saw spouts from boat while heading to Everett from Hat [Island], sounds like
a gray, north end of river delta near Marysville heading north
, I'm looking but can't confirm yet. -Lori Christopher

Entry 3:
17:39 -
Just the one, and it is still just north of the second ferry dock. Long down times. And I really can't discern
if it really is a minke
the more I see it.

17:30 -
I have eyes on it just north of the second ferry dock, and they may be right. Appears
possibly minke
, moving NW. Hard to tell with the lighting. -Durand Dace

16:55 -
Donna Sanders, WS Ferries Marine Ops called to relay report from MV Tokitae:
1 gray south of Clinton dock heading north
...Donna then called back, Tokitae crew changed their report to 3 minkes.
