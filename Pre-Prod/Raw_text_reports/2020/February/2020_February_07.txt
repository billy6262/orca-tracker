From Burt Miller, WSF: On Friday,

Entry 2:
9 km from the Colman Dock Ferry Terminal in Seattle
. They were closer to the Bainbridge Island side than to Seattle. They are traveling south. The in-water pile work has been stopped until the whales leave the 9 km shutdown zone observed for the Colman Project. As of 1243 the whales are still in the area, but are expected to continue south, leaving our shutdown zone soon.

midchannel now. Still heading southbound.

11:38 - They are moving south fast midchannel
.

11:28 - [orcas] 5 or 6 passing Fay [Bainbridge Park]
right now! Looked like there was a calf with them. They are moving south. They came out of the cove north of Fay Bainbridge. I'd say 100 meters from shore before going mid channel. -Kris Clark
