Here's what I heard/saw today...so far (it's only
10:15a.m. )
04:15 very distant
J Pod calls off Lime Kiln HPs
...
07:00 echolocation clicks off Lime Kiln...saw only
1 orca about 1/3 mile from shore
- going slowly down island...I too 'went down island' a short distance and saw that same whale still going in the same direction. I looked for others but none...thought I saw one miles across Haro Strait, but could not confirm...then I heard a few brief
J Pod calls off Lime Kiln
...I could never locate who was 'attached' to those calls. What a fun morning. -Jeanne Hyde
See Jeanne's Whale of a Purpose blog for her very interesting acoustical observations on this day.

a pair of bottlenose dolphins traveling north up Colvos Passage around
