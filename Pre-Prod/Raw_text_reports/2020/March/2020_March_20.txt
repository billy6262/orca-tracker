, as they rounded Pelorus Point, they saw a group of killer whales off their bow coming towards them. They put the brakes on, and Mark immediately recognized the
T010's and T049A's
as they completed their last breath before going into a long dive. As Mike 1 trolled along back to the south waiting for the next sequence, Mark spotted more animals behind them at the
north end of Moresby Island
. ... Mike 1 and
T049A2
arrived in unison to see
T063, T065, the T049B's
, and the
T071's
milling about in a social group." See CWR Encounter #18 for full encounter summary and more photos. -photo by Mark Malleson, Center for Whale Research -

Pretty sure these are
long-beaked common dolphins
. They played in our bow wake today just east of the north end of
Harstine Island, in South Sound
- about 1pm. We only saw two. Quite a fun and rare experience to have bow play in Puget Sound! [See Benjamin's video] -Benjamin Doerr
