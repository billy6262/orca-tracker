We had the pleasure of finding

Center for Whale Research encounter near Sooke, B.C., Strait of Juan de Fuca: "... At
1618
they received another second hand report from Paul that a group of
east bound killer whales were spotted from shore near Otter Point
. Mike 1 turned around and headed that way and Paul departed his dock and located the reported whales within a half mile of the Sooke bluffs a few minutes before Mark and Val arrived at 1700. They quickly confirmed the
T010's, T063 and T065 along with the T086A's and another unidentified matriline of 3 or 4 individuals later to be confirmed as the T068B's
. ..." See CWR Encounter #17 for full encounter summary and photos.

Center for Whale Research encounter with
T49As and T71s
: "... This group was doing all sorts of behaviors-very few of them fitting nicely into our behavior categories. A few of the older whales were loosely spread within 100 yards of the play group. Another pair of sub-adults were rolling around together a few dozen yards to the side of the younger whales. At least one of these two was a male. The transients turned out to be the T49As and the T71s-11 whales in total. ..." See CWR Encounter #16 for full encounter summary and more photos. -photo by Katie Jones, Center for Whale Research -

He was so close below our bluff at
Eagle Crest
that I couldn't get a good look, so I took the tram down to the beach. By then he was so far out I could barely see him. I am convinced that this was

March 19 gray whale sightings in previous report dated 3/26). Alice (Moyal) caught a nice pic,
east side of Hat
, it looks like 531? [
Yes,
531 ID confirmed
by Alisa, ON
]...Traveling. We also have 3 grays that came north from south end of island, right now! -Lori Christopher

Entry 5:
a minke just off the shore near Glendale Beach
about 30 min ago [
~
16:45
]. I tried to get a photo but it was too far away....we saw its back a few times & back fin. At first, we thought it was a porpoise. It looked black from a distance. We've seen Grey, Orca, porpoise, sea lion, seal...this looked different but hey, who knows? Didn't see any blow. -Tammy Evans

Entry 6:
Elger Bay, Camano Island
: "...sitting at table doing whale spotting been seeing increase in gray whales. I am staring directly at Baby Island. We saw about
25-30 blows
last night (18th) it was exciting and wonderful, assume it was grays. Today (19th) at
1:27 was staring at direction of
Elger Bay towards the point at the park (Camano Isl. SP)
and saw a blow convinced it was orca today, close to shore. A boat came through, not sure has anything to do with it but have not seen blow since. -Allyson, Camano Island
