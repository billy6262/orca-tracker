pass in front of our house. We are on the

Steve Hipskin called - "We are at the end of
Race Road, on Mussel Beach Rd
.... We just saw
4 of the Transients
that were recorded earlier at
Harrington Cove
. We saw them heading southbound out front of our house. Looked to be 4, w/at least one male. They were a little bit closer to Whidbey side, but close to mid channel. moving quickly. We saw them come up 2 or 3 times, then surface far to the south. Not a lot of good looks, but definitely got some nice looks of them heading pretty fast southbound." -Steve Hipskin

"In these strange dystopian times, yesterday's adventure was a welcome reminder of the wonderful world of whales and nature, with transient orcas and gray whales in and around Whidbey Island. Our first encounter was with the T46s and T122 (we believe) making their way north in Saratoga Passage as a flock of Trumpeter swans flew directly overhead, followed by sighting of a gray whale exhaling under a bluff as the orcas trended toward Oak Harbor. Our return trip was equally inspiring, encountering three gray whales traveling together north in Saratoga Passage beyond Baby Island, trending toward Hidden Beach. So much magnificence and beauty all in the space of a few miles. Phew! Quite overwhelming. -Sandra Pollard
