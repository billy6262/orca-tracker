Orca Sightings for March 15, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
(Strait of Juan de Fuca)
Center for Whale Research Encounter #15: "... The bull surfaced nearby and was confirmed to be
T010C
, so it was assumed that
his mom T010
was the second whale. Sure enough, after ~10 minutes tracking the large male a second animal appeared just ahead of him, milling in place. With the distinctive notch near the base of her dorsal fin T010 was confirmed. The two whales continued working the area, apparently after a seal, though no other marine mammal was ever observed. ..." See CWR Encounter #15 for full encounter summary and photos.

made me think they were greys

about 4-5 individuals
, did not see any dorsal fins, they were grey/black, they never did a full breach so I'm not sure of length. -Lizzy Grace
