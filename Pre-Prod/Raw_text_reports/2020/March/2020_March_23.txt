Orca Sightings for March 23, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
15:45 (approx.
) - #chiefwhalespotter and I followed the 4 gangs as they headed N/W in Discovery with a heavy ebb current.
T063, T065, T090s, T099s, and T100s
were present during this encounter. I have never photographed T063 with T090 before, there was much swordplay and
T099C
spent most of the time with those two. They all slid through Seymour Narrows at 10 knots with the last of the ebb then finished off their socialization just above Browns Bay. As the tide turned to flood and a big push of the current rolled past us there was a distinct split in the 4 gangs. The T100s and T090s hesitated then headed N/W and the T099s with T063 and T065 headed South very fast with the new flood current. We traveled with them through
Seymour Narrows
at 12 knots and left them to head home!
T090s, T099s, & T100s, 090B, T063 "Chainsaw", T099C, T099D

Just passed
Point Robinson
, mid channel, headed southbound. Long down times but in travel mode. One male leading, and one male traveling with about 6 others including a calf. [T46D IDd from Marla's back-of-camera pic on post] Pretty sure the other male was T46E, but need to pull it up on my computer for a closer look. Such strange times, eh? I wasn't sure what to expect when I pulled up to the beach, ready to practice my social distancing, but was the only soul at the beach to catch the
T46s
[et al.] as they very quietly and quickly slipped by. A pretty sweet pass in the solitude of just their company and the cold spring.
T46D, T46E

Entry 8:
10:30am
, I spied what looked like a juvenile
gray whale in an area of Hood Canal about 3 miles east of Union, WA
. It was swimming westward (outbound) within 100 ft of shore and came up for air twice before I lost sight of it. I am not a whale expert, but I will do my best to describe what I saw. Details:
--Definitely a cetacean. I saw it spout from the blowhole twice.
--No major dorsal fin, so I don't think it was an orca or a dolphin
--Color was medium gray with lighter mottling
--It looked long and skinny but appeared juvenile based on size. If I had to guess on length, I would say 12 to 15 feet
--It arched its back before diving but I didn't see the tail
I hope this is helpful. I would love to know if any others have reported this whale. Thanks for the work you do! -Sutter Wehmeier

Entry 9:
Penn Cove (newly-documented gray whale)
- Dead calm water, dusk, nobody else around - oh except for
one gray whale
. His exhalation was 'breathtaking' - so loud in the silence. And I kept my allotted social distance from the whale. What an uplifting treat!! (This is a new whale to our area, [now designated by Cascadia Research Collective as
CRC #2258
-gs]) -Jill Hein
