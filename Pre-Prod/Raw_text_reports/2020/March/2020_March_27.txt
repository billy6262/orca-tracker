Entry 3:

What is believed to have been
a gray whale was sighted on a rare journey far up Hood Canal, around Big Bend at Annas Bay and up into Lynch Cove
. At approximately
4:30PM, I witnessed the back half of a whale that had surfaced for air 1/4 mile off the south shore of Hood Canal. The sighting occurred
3.5 miles northeast of Twanoh State Park
, as the whale swam southeastward, toward the park. This location places the whale within approx 4 miles of the far end of the Canal. The whale seemed to be alone, making me wonder if s/he was off on an adventurous solo journey - way off the usual track. In my 56 years of time on this stretch of salt water, neither I nor anyone I know has confirmed a whale sighting up here. Very Excited in Happy Hollow, Steve Brennan
