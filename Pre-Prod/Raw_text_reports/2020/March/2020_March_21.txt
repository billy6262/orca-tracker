March 21/John Judy continued: We stayed with
#22 Earhart and #21 Shackleton
for quite a long time. They meandered very slowly, sometimes closer to the island, sometimes closer to the shore, but generally traveling north up
between Hat Island and the Mainland
. The speed was so slow at times they appeared to be almost standing still, just floating to the surface to blow and then dropping back down. I missed one very significant event with the camera. (That unfortunately is when the cookies were being passed around.) About
2:30 PM the whales very suddenly accelerated their speed. One whale did a half breach followed by a full breach. While not on my camera that photo will forever be imbedded in my mind. After the breach the whales made a sharp direction change to the SE and resumed their original slow travel speed. It appeared they might have been
headed toward the Snohomish Delta
to feed. It was approaching high tide. We did not stay with them long enough to verify that is actually what they were doing. During our time with Earhart and Shackleton, I managed some nice fluke photos of Earhart showing both sides of her tail. In the first, Shackleton can be seen beside Earhart. -John Judy
*
March 21/John Judy continued:
#22 "Earhart" and #21 "Shackleton"
gave some ladies in a boat a pretty fabulous drive by. First Earhart showed her dorsal while Shackleton made his blow. I would add these ladies where good responsible whale watchers. a) the telephoto lens makes the whales look closer than they may have actually been. b) they had their motor off and where drifting the whole time. The whales approached them; they did not approach the whales. -John Judy
*

13:00 -
Our second sighting of the day,
March 21, was around 1 PM. We had heard a report from Orca Network of two whales traveling east from Clinton toward our location at SE Hat. We were scanning for them and picked up
two whales
out in deep water traveling towards us. They were traveling slowly and turned around the
SE corner of Hat Island changing their direction of travel from E to N
. They started moving up into the deep-water channel between Hat Island and the Mainland.
CRC #21 "Shackleton", CRC #22 "Earhart"
-John Judy
*

12:30 -
Our first whale sighting was around
12:30 in the shallow, 50-foot waters off the
SE corner of Hat Island
. We ran into
#49 "Patch"
. He was milling around back and forth and appeared to be feeding. -John Judy
*

12:13 - Gray south east of Hat Island
right now. -Riley Bidwell
*

12:03 - Gray out north of the Clinton ferry docks
now! (Definitely were feeding at the time I saw them, then headed north towards Hat.) -Alina Chris Sherrett
*

10:45 -
Maija with WS Ferries Marine Ops just called to report crews spotted

Wed, Mar 18 - We had a nice surprise today, with the passage of a large (spread-out) orca pod traveling in the
Strait of Georgia
in front of a beautiful snowy mountain backdrop. From Mayne Island. Rachelle Hayden on Galiano tells me also that she thinks this is the
J pod
... it was quite stretched along a long line, not bunched together.. But I did see probably 6 orcas, give or take 1.. Could have been 7...Yves Tiberghien
[
per Dave Ellifrit at Center for Whale Research: "J19 is definitely in there and what looks like
J39
..."
]
*
Today,
J-Pod (salmon feeding orcas) visited Friday Harbor
. What a delight to see them socializing and playing as they meandered
down San Juan Channel
. I am told by local researchers that they look pretty healthy right now, which is so great to hear, given the challenges they face with prey availability. I put my hydrophone in for some of the encounter so you can hear them vocalizing in the beginning of the video. -Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watching
*
I really thought today would be about going out to find the Bigg's killer whales that have been going through for the last few days. Nope. Enter
J Pod
.
They came down President Channel into San Juan Channel
for their usual circuit. They cruised in, with
J31 and J56
being the first orcas we saw. They spread out wide and maybe going out to the ocean? They were almost to the harbor when an orca did a couple of pectoral fin slaps, then J40 Suttles did at least four belly flops and it was, "About Face!". They did their u-turn,
[J27] Blackberry
did a nice tail slap with
[J26] Mike
and company, and happy hour kicked in. No social distancing, no take out only, just a lot of family time.
J53 Kiki
popped up with salmon remnants hanging from her teeth. Cuddling got serious and four of the five are
J40 Suttles, J42 Echo, J46 Star and J53 Kiki
(lots of help from Sara Hysong-Shimazu, who is amazing with her observations and helps put together the picture of how the extended family of J Pod is interacting). Another amazing afternoon with the most amazing species. -April Ryan, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

14:18 - Orcas headed south down San Juan Channel, just past Jones [Island]
