Entry 1:
Georgia/Mayne Island -

Here are a few photos take around 245pm today. A
pod of orcas in the blue waters of the Strait of Georgia
. They seemed really busy. Not swimming leisurely as usual. They were bursting out of the water and back in very fast... Heading south toward the US border...Cheers, Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island, BC - photos by Yves Tiberghien -

Nadine Woolman, a marine naturalist who lives on Stavis Bay Rd,
Seabeck
, called to report
at least 4 orcas (1 male and 3 females) in Hood Canal
, first traveling south, then separated, then definitely hunting/feeding (gulls getting scraps). The male and 1 female separated by couple hundred yards traveling 1/2 mile south of Duckabush River. Exciting to have these guys in Hood Canal.

Entry 4:
Mayne Island, B.C. -

20:00 -
I should add one more
humpback
sighting last night. I was walking at 8pm on the Edith Point Ocean Trail on Mayne. I heard and saw at least one large humpback puffing and swimming beautifully several times, far in the distance toward Mt Baker in the Strait of Georgia, opposite Saturna, and probably en route toward US waters. It was very peaceful in the evening light. No boat in sight. As far as I know, this humpback was not signaled on our SGI social media whale sighting group. In any case, it is amazing to witness the increase in humpback visits!! They are here every week, it seems, and sometimes more than once a week. A few years ago, they were very rare in the Strait of Georgia. -Cheers, Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island

I wanted to send in this sighting of
a Gray Whale
we had during our research - 5/15/2020 in
Burrows Pass
- a big surprise to us that it came so close! It was travelling from Burrows Bay
west out to Rosario Strait
. Hopefully to find food elsewhere. Hope you are well! -Cindy Elliser, Research Director, Pacific Mammal Research

I was on the water
May 15th. In the early afternoon I spotted this
lone Gray Whale
feeding on the south end of the
Snohomish Delta

--The second whale that I was able to ID on
May 15th was
#723 Lucyfer
. It is noteworthy that at times
#723 and #22 were swimming in close proximity
with synchronized dives and everything. I would normally expect to see #22 paired up with #21 Shackleton. The first photo is a near boat collision with #22 Earhart. I was sitting, motor off, watching the whales when I saw a boat approaching full speed right toward where I thought they would surface next.. I waved and tried to slow the guy down - he just looked at me waved back and kept going. I saw a surface disturbance right in front of his boat. I just cringed. The boat shot through and in this photo the whale surfaced right in his wake. I believe Earhart actually ducked to avoid getting hit by that boat.
Later in the day on
May 15th the wind died off. I was able to spot
more whales, at least 4
. There was one on the
Snohomish Delta
, I didn't photograph that one, and three more on the
SE Hat Island
feeding ground. Of the three on the feeding ground, I identified one as
#22 Earhart
. - photos by John Judy -
