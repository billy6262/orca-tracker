Entry 2:
Bellingham Bay (T123s) - ~

18:30 -
Hello! My husband and I were returning to Squalicum Harbor from Inati Bay this evening and were suddenly in the presence of
a small pod of orcas
. They were leaving the bay and headed south. We had just rounded Portage Island on our way to Bellingham. Appeared to be a couple of females, 1 or 2 babies, and a male. Time of day was around
6:30pm. -Michele Bennett

This photo was taken at

4:30 p.m., just north of Eliza Island
, and they looked to be heading toward the opening
between Eliza Island and the south end of Lummi
. What a thrill it was to see these three in Bellingham Bay today, especially the young one!!! -Jann Ledbetter

Hi there! I'm sure you've gotten plenty of reports about the
orcas in Hood Canal
today but just in case, I'd like to share my observations; For starters, I would like to say that I did all of my viewing
from highway 106, between the Skokomish River and Belfair
. First spotted orcas traveling East towards Belfair from Alderbrook Resort & spa at 1pm. Traveling fast, multiple boats following. Seemed to just be traveling at the time and I wasn't able to count. From there, they continued
nearly to the end of the canal in Belfair
, turned around and were spotted heading back west and out of the canal from Twanoh State Park at
4:30pm. Still traveling along the north shore on the Kitsap peninsula side. From there, they continued west, traveling all the way back up to the bend, near the
Skokomish River estuary
. Seemed as if they were doing a bit of hunting at this time. ~5pm. Lost them afterwards and assumed that they swam around the peninsula and started heading out of the canal. However, I got a report from a friend that they actually turned around and headed back towards Belfair. Spotted at trails end drive along highway 106 around
7:45pm. Being that I was on the opposite shore, I couldn't get the best views for details on which pod it may have been but being that they were in the canal, I'm going to assume they were transients. From videos I've seen posted, the saddle patches were closed to support this. If I were to guess, I would say there were about 5 of them. I've been studying videos my community has posted and it looks as if there was only one male in the pod. Certainly no pale whale, so I can tell you which pod it WASNT. Wishing everyone at Orca Network the best. Thank you for what you do. -Best, Shay Slye

16:50 - OMG, 3 juvenile orcas just north of Calm Cove in Union. Heading west
. We just moved here. So excited. -Jim Swanson
*

16:00 -
Update as of
4:00pm: The
Orcas must be up towards Belfair
, as I still have many more seals than usual up against the shoreline. I haven't seen them since around
2:00pm. Will report back if I see anything additional.

13:35 -
They're now headed towards Sisters on the
North Shore (probably across from Twanoh State Park
).

13:30 -
Reporting in. As I passed Ayres (aka Bald) Point, lots of cars pulled over and folks down on the beach. I am now home, by the
mouth of the Tahuya River
, and can see them with my binoculars, so they're mid-Canal across from Union. The last sighting, I saw 3 dorsal fins. They are very far from me, so I can't get good photos or video, unfortunately.
Noon - Orcas in Hood Canal
! Down by the
Great Bend/Skokomish/Union/Potlatch area
. At least two, possibly more. Too far away for me to get photos and have my husband watching friends m our place by the mouth of the Tahuya River. Two years ago at the end l of April, T65s went to the area known as the Sisters, hunted, and then left. So exciting!...Yeah, there were two skidoos out and they were being butts. But the boats were great. They just sat, no power and let the pod do what they wanted. I'm hoping they go down to Sisters again so my husband can see them. It did look like there was a littler one in amongst the adults. So direction - first headed south to the Great Bend, then turned to the east, as the Canal bends and heads (NNE) to Belfair. Think that's where they are now. I'm currently at my dad's, right across from Hoodsport, so no visibility beyond the Great Bend (aka Ayres Point, also called Bald Point)....I will be headed back home soon and will report any updates as I observe. Suspect we have a lot of seals as close in as possible. Two years ago, we had 28 up against the beach. -Karla Oma

This was on Hood Canal, Mother's Day Sunday about 6 pm. Looked like
4 traveling south[west] in between Twanoh State Park & Union
, medium speed. They were on the west side of the water. Don't know much more than that but was great to see them. I live at E Pebble Beach Lane. Hope this helps. -Nancy Campbell [

16:00 - A pod of orcas were in south Hood Canal
today,
May 10. They
headed towards Twanoh State Park
at about 1 pm and headed back outbound around 4 pm. Two males and three to four females /juveniles. -Tracy Stoops
*
We saw
3 orcas come through southern hood canal
today. They went
past Tahuya
, through the narrow passageway toward Belfair (out of sight of us)
around 1-2pm
. A few hours later they came back and headed toward Hoodsport (out of sight again). From shore with binoculars, we think there were just three... One was small, one large, and the other was a bit smaller than the big one. It's the first time in almost 70 years of our family coming to this property that we have seen orcas here. Very special!! -Jill Leslie

Hello. We watched
7 Orcas, with at least 2 small ones, traveling from Bald Point (The Big Bend) towards Belfair

SPECIES UNCONFIRMED - Sun,

Entry 9:
18:25 -
Alicia Gohiggin called to report possible
orca sighting on the Kingston to Edmonds run
. They were on Spokane ferry out of Kingston, approximately half way to Edmonds. The whale did not breach, but they saw blowhole and dorsal fin. Whale was heading west towards Kingston, traveling at pretty good rate.

Sun,

Entry 10:
17:30 -
After this encounter, I took a long trip up
Saratoga Passage all the way to Skagit Bay
. I didn't see any whales until I was on my way home. Around
5:30 in the afternoon I encountered two more whales, near shore, off the south tip of Camano Island. They were traveling north moving very fast. I saw several more whales on the South end of the Snohomish Delta near the barge. Not sure how many animals were in that group but they appeared to be feeding not traveling. It is notable this sighting was made at mid flood tide. I don't usual see whales on the Delta until full high tide because of shallow water. I did not get photos of these last two sightings - it was windy, getting rough and late in the day.

12:30 -
I was out Sunday
May 10th, and took these photos around
12:30 PM off the
SW corner of Hat Island
. The whales were milling and feeding. I believe that is
#723 Lucyfer.
