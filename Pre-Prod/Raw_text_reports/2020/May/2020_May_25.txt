Emily called, she and Steve are aboard their boat "Patience" following along coast of Whidbey at Strawberry Point, just past Mariner Cove, heading towards
Polnell Point
. They spotted
at least 2 gray whales
. A smaller one was traveling in about 30ft of water along shore, and a larger one was off to their left further in the channel
between N Utsalady Point, Camano, and Polnell Point
. They were currently stopped w/all systems shut down to observe the whales, who were just milling and slowly moving southward. Said she would email with some photos of the smaller whale.
