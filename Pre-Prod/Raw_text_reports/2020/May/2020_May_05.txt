Kathleen Waldron called to report seeing
orcas
. She lives on the south end of
Marrowstone Island near Indian Island
on Oak Bay.
4-5 orcas
(incl one w/large dorsal) going east. They just passed the channel marker heading towards end of Marrowstone heading east. She also saw a couple of seals hugging the shore. Exciting for her, it was her first time seeing them there in the 7 years she's lived on Marrowstone.

Entry 3:
Haro Strait -
Observed and photographed from shore. At

11:05 am
I observed
2 humpbacks traveling to the north just past the northern end of Hannah Hts.
The humpbacks only surfaced a few times then made a hard left just south of Edwards Point heading west away from the island. Both humpbacks had small white markings on the trailing edge of their dorsal fins. I only saw one fluke and it looked all dark with no markings on the underside. Not much information for an ID but the whales were stealthy today. -photos (all) by Michelline Halliday -

Entry 4:
[
ID Notes: "...I would say
BCX1333 "Ghost"
is the fluker (she seems to have more scarring on the dorsal, and what appears to be maybe additional scarring along the spinal ridge than she did last year), and the other with the more pointed dorsal (pictured on the left of the photos with both whales in the frame) I am undecided. Erin and I have a suspicion this second whale is "Zephyr" (the 2011 calf of BCX1057), but
MMX0132 "Uluka"
is also a possible contender, so not a certain match either way." -Tasli Shaw
"My confidence level is high with "Zephyr" as Tasli said, but agree it's hard to be certain." -Erin Gless]

Entry 5:
16:30-

19:00 -
I went up into the
Snohomish River Delta area about
4:30 PM
,
May 5. It was high tide. I was hoping there might be a whale or two up in the shallow water feeding. I didn't at first see anything, but I shut my motor off and listened and heard some whales not too far off. Before I left at
7:00 PM I had enjoyed multiple encounters and identified that there were at least six whales in the area feeding. I was not able to get photos of all of them.
#22 "Earhart" left underside fluke, #22 Earhart" top left-side fluke, #22 "Earhart" top left-side fluke and top left pec fin, on her right side, feeding

The next set of photos must be prefaced by saying I did not and do not approach the whales closely. If you are an avid whale watcher, like me, they will, on occasion, approach you. That's what happened here. I was sitting, motor off, actually drifting away from the whales when #723 Lucyfer decided he would make an approach. He was feeding as he came toward me; obviously not bothered by my presence at all.

Entry 7:
19:15 -
Just reporting
a whale sighting in the south sound, west of Anderson Island
. Just milling about right now.
Species: Unsure. Gray? Minke?
(update from Shingo: I said I saw it "west of Anderson Island" but "north of Tolmie" is probably a better description of where the whale was. I only noticed one but a neighbor said he noted two.) -Shingo Y.

I was at
Tolmie from
5:00 to
6:00
and heard the gray whale blow right when I made it down to the beach at
5:00. I spotted him/her straight out from the beach, just out past the anchored sailboat. S/he surfaced at mostly 5-minute intervals, one 10-minute interval, and a couple at 2 minutes. S/he was slowly
moving northwesterly up Nisqually Reach
the last time I saw and heard him/her at
5:37. -photos by Gayle Swigart, Orca Network -
