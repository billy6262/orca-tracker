We had
a gray whale come by Polnell Point in Oak Harbor,
WA for dinner, @

Entry 4:
two Gray Whales
today. It was around
11:30 or
12:00 PM just past low tide. The general behavior of these whales was a little different than what I have seen previously. The first whale, which I identified as
CRC # 22 Earhart
, (photos 4348, 4362, 4390, 4395, 4396) was swimming very slowly, over deep water, back and forth
between Hat Island and the Snohomish Delta
. She almost had the appearance of waiting for something. I hope her tail wave (photo 4395, 4396) was not her saying good bye for the season. The second whale, which I could not identify (photos 4399, 4406, 4408) was swimming back and forth
parallel to the edge of the Snohomish Delta
at a 90-degree angle to the first whale. This whale was ranging from near the barge on the S end almost all the way up to Tulalip on the N. I came back into this area on a second scan for whales at high tide. I didn't see any animals at all that time. ["The other whale is
CRC-2255

Between

two common dolphins
with binoculars as they frolicked while trending southbound in Case Inlet between Harstine Island and Herron Island. No pictures this time but it was great to see them again. -Connor O'Brien
