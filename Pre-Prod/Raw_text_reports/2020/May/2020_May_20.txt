Entry 3:
17:30 - Spotted a solo [humpback] heading south across Commencement Bay in Tacoma
today at 530pm. It was bigger than we had seen before. The fluke was 8-12' wide. It went right in front of our boat at one point and it didn't seem to have much coloration difference along its body. If you're able to determine what it is please let us know. If it WAS a Humpback my daughter will have had 3 sightings with 3 different whales!!! -photo by Dawson Kaminski -

We saw a
humpback
at 550am this morning, mid channel, north end of
Salmon Beach
. The whale was heading northbound. Milled around for about 15-20 min mid channel then slowly headed northwest a bit towards
Gig Harbor
. Lost track after that. -Teri Fields Mattsen

GRAY WHALES - Wed,

Entry 5:
Birch Bay
- We saw around 20 blows in 45 minutes. Guessing they were viewed from 1 mile away. Very brief view, a blow then slow roll. No tails seen. Often blows were 5-20 seconds apart then a wait. Most of the water in the area is 30-50' deep, a bit deeper closer to Pt Whitehorn. -Eric Ellingson
