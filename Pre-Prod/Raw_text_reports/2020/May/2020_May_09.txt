Drifting with Orcas 5/9/20-
Hood Canal, Bangor
. My wife Joanne took this video on the bow of Zebedee, our 21' Arima. Our neighbor Norma called me while I was fishing and said they spotted Orcas near Hood Head Island. I picked up Joanne and went to look for them and they were gone. It was gorgeous out so we decided to head south of the Hood Canal Bridge and we spotted a few dorsal fins heading south. We got to Bangor Naval Submarine Base and thought we had seen the last of them so we headed north and Joanne spotted 2 smaller dorsal fins (dolphins), followed by large black dorsal fins, and we thought, uh-oh there's dinner! Immediately turned off the engines watched them and they swam toward us. Another amazing experience...Thank you Jesus! [VIDEO by Willie Moneda] -Willie Moneda

07:45-

08:15 -
I had help from CeCe (who originally reported
the gray
via ON messenger this morning, about 45ish minutes before I found him). She was in what appeared to be a sea kayak and helped me locate the whale from the bluff at Scenic Heights. At the time, he was almost centered in the Harbor with the marina behind him. At first he was moving north and would pop up about every 2 minutes to exhale/inhale. As he made his way into more shallow water he started to feed. I got a few photos from Scenic Heights Rd. before heading back down to Windjammer Park since he kept getting closer to the public access point. By the time I got down to the park he was still definitely feeding and at one point couldn't have been but 200-300 yards off the park. I viewed from

7:45am-
8:15am
when he appeared to start heading back south, out of the harbor.

14:00 -
Never sent a whale sighting in before, so I hope I'm getting everything you need. Location:
Crescent Harbor
48.289069,-122.619447. We had what I believe to be a juvenile humpback whale circle around our sailboat at approximately 100m. I've never seen a humpback whale in Puget Sound, but I've seen them before with the Navy. This looked just like one, but smaller. I saw him swim through water that couldn't have been more than 10-15 feet deep, pulling very close to shore. Lost sight of him as he headed south into the Saratoga Passage. -Jimmy Brokaw
