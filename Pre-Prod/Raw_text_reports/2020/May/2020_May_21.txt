Entry 2:
Puget Sound/Alki
- Here are a few photos from my
Humpback whale
encounter on 5/21/2020. - I was out walking my dog on the path along Alki when I spotted a large splash off Restoration Point, Bainbridge Island, followed by a blow and then another large splash. Of course, I had left my binoculars and camera in the car. I "fast walked" back to my car and was able to get a few photos of the whale as it fluked a few times. Images were submitted to HappyWhale for an ID confirmation (no ID currently, I will update if/when I hear back). Happy whale sightings, -photos by Brittany Philbin -

18:00-

18:45 -
In BVV [Birch Bay Village, north side of the bay] looking toward the State Park [Birch Bay State Park, to the south]. I'd
guess more than one [gray whale]
by the frequency of the blows, sometimes about 5-15 seconds apart, but don't know enough about the behavior to make that call. It was a long way off, guessing over a mile. -photos by Eric Ellingson -

MINKE WHALES - Thu,

Entry 5:
14:00 - Off Alki, close to shore, 2 PM. Smaller and smoother than humpback, bigger than orca, sharply hooked dorsal fin. Southbound. Updated: Sorry, it was a
Minke whale
not a Fin. It was close to shore, visible without binoculars. I had binoculars and could see the smooth skin. The dorsal fin was exactly like a minke. Size was smaller than a humpback but bigger than an orca. Was steady south bound from
63rd and Alki to Constellation Park around 2pm
today. My first Minke! Have seen Orcas, humpbacks and grays before. Knew it was something different. Thanks for taking the report. There was a verified humpback near the same area about 3 hours before my Minke sighting so most think I saw that humpback, but it was truly a Minke. West Seattle had a good whale day today. -Robin Sinner
