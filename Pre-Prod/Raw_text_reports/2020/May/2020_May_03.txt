Orca Sightings for May 3, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca/Discovery Bay (T46Bs+) - ~

09:15-

11:30 - A pod of orcas
came into Discovery Bay,
May 3, at about
9:15 a.m., heading south to the bottom of the bay. They started back out about
11:30 moving very slowly. They would submerge for quite a while then come up and spout and roll 4 or 5 times then dive deep again. I believe it was
T46[B] pod because we saw the gray young one
. There were about 8, two with huge dorsal fins and the rest much smaller. They headed towards Protection Island then turned towards Cape George. After that we lost them. -Karel Reeves

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca - ~

14:30 - [orca]
I saw a small group of
4-5 individuals near Protection Island around Sequim
. They had been reported earlier in the day in Discovery Bay. I got some video of them; I was pretty far away. I don't know how old they were. The glimpses of them was very brief. They were swimming along the coastline between Protection Island and the shore coming from Discovery Bay, heading up the coastline, so I would have to say north? Towards Port Angeles. -Craig Barron

May 3 (
"SCUBA", 2019 calf of BCX1193 "Zig Zag"
) - Hi all! I wanted to let you know that I had a VERY fun sighting last night in
Burrows Pass near Anacortes
of all places (I've never seen a humpback swim through there!). With Tasli's help, we were able to ID the whale as Scuba, Zig Zag's 2019 calf. So great to see this little one back! -photo by Erin Gless (photos Tyler McKeen)

Entry 5:
Elliott Bay
(reinclusion of sighting to add uncertainty of species). [Mon,
May 4] - Yes, down in
Elliott Bay
- not certain on humpback, potentially grey whale. We only saw the spout and no tail. Two breaths and they were spaced out by a few minutes. Seemed to be heading south towards Alki, but from the two moments we saw them it's hard to say for certain.
