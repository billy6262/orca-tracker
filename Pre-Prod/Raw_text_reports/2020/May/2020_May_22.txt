Another relayed shore report has these whales in the middle of

My neighbor, here in
Hannah Heights on SJI
, just told me that he saw four
orcas pass within 300 yards of shore
at about 4pm, heading down island. He said they mulled about in front of Hannah Heights for 15 mins, and then passed out of sight heading down island past Pile Point. I rushed out, but I did not see them myself. ["Yes, definitely a second group." Monika Wieland Shields, OBI] -Michael Noonan

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sat,

Entry 4:
17:15 - Humpback heading S. into Budd Inlet
. On western shore. Very robust blows (3 and then a long dive) and a few tail flukes. (update: We never saw it head out of Budd and were looking. It must have done a wildly long-distance dive to get by ALL of us...) photos Kim Merriman
