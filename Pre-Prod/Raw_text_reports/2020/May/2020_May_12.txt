Orca Sightings for May 12, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait -

13:35-

14:25 - Between the north edge of Hannah Hts. and Edwards Point, a humpback
traveling slowly to the north. It was a long wait between exhalations and sometimes I could only see its blowhole. It surfaced a dozen times. I didn't see its fluke. Photographed from shore, cropped and enlarged. ["This is

from last year." -Jackie Hildering, Marine Education and Research Society] -Michelline Halliday, SJI. -photos by Michelline Halliday -

Entry 2:
Hood Canal -

15:40 -
I can't believe we have another sighting to report! We are located o
ne mile south of Duckabush River and just south of Hood Point
. At about
3:40pm (
May 12th) we spotted
a gray whale
about 30 yards from our house. He was feasting on fish near our buoy for about 30 minutes then he traveled south. -Ellen Proffit - photos by Ellen Proffit -

Entry 3:
Southern Saratoga Passage -

13:45 - A lone gray whale is heading west along Camano Island side of Saratoga Passage
.
1:45 pm
May 12. We watched it go up toward Pebble Beach and then westward till we couldn't see it. We live in Langley on Edgecliff, and it's 2 miles across the Passage so I can't tell what kind of whale. Most likely gray or humpback. Too far away to see and it was mostly blowing, no tails or flippers. -Luanne Seymour
