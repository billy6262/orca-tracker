06:45 - Large pod of orcas this morning spread out between Camano and Everett, heading north
. No ID's. Maria was on the

Orcas between Ediz Hook and New Dungeness
. 3 or 4 miles from the Hook. I think [heading] north towards Victoria and [there were]

We were on our boat in Port Susan this afternoon. We spotted
two gray whales
. They weren't particularly large, as we have seen in the past. We were near the shallows at the North end of Port Susan about noon today,
May 28, traveling northwesterly from
near Kayak Point
, toward even shallower water, but then westerly toward the Camano Island side of the bay. Regular blow, so didn't stay down long. -Kathy Weber

Entry 4:
Herron Island
in Washington on the West side of the island. They are traveling North here. My boyfriend was watching them longer and said it looked like a big one and a smaller one. He said it looked like the smaller one was watching the bigger one jump. The big one would jump several times, then the smaller one would jump once and not as high. -Stephanie Hill
