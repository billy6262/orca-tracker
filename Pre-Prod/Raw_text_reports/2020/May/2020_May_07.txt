From down island, to miles off shore...at first all together and then a split...two stayed way behind the others and ended up coming in close, while the rest of the family stayed miles from shore and continued on disappearing from view. It was
T049A1 and T049A2
who split off from the rest of the family this morning. -Jeanne Hyde

COASTAL KILLER WHALES - Thur,

Entry 4:
Oregon Coast -

14:20 - Approximately 1 1/2 miles offshore at Three Arch Rocks, Oceanside Oregon
, there was a male killer whale sighting. He was not stopping. He was going straight North along the shore. Much like the shape of C-25 ORCA. From looking at all of the fin pictures in the Canadian publication, I would have to believe it to be a fairly large male. -KP Ives

14:20 - At
2:20 p.m.
on the 7th of
May 2020,
Oceanside Oregon
, about a mile and a half off shore, outside of the
Three Arch Rocks
, a tall slender dorsal fin of a killer whale heading North. -Daciden Ivoets

Entry 5:
Western Strait of Juan de Fuca - ~
12:45 and

15:00 - Saw two separate gray whales
along the Straits of Juan de Fuca just east of Sail Rock along the shore, and also a sea otter about 3 miles east of Sail Rock. The first gray was westbound. Picked him up about 2 miles east of Sail Rock, and he continued west until he reached Sail Rock, where I assume he was feeding, as he remained there for 2 hours. I moved over to Sail Rock to get a few better pics, and he just milled back and forth, so I am assuming eating. The 2nd gray was a surprise, as I was taking pics of the otter when he breached to the right of the otter right near a rock. Maybe he was too close. That was at mile marker 5. He was heading east at that moment then turned and headed west and continued going west, and never saw him again. First whale I picked up around
12:45 and 2nd whale was about 3 pm on 5/7/2020. The first gray had a really obvious white patch on left side of peduncle, second whale was very white. Sea otter was wrapped in kelp near a rock outcropping. Thought he was sleeping but later could see he was eating. Was very light colored (I actually thought it was a seal at first as I was driving.). He was really huge. Only saw the one. -Alethea Leddy

Thur,

Entry 6:
Northern Saratoga Passage - We had two (possibly three) Gray Whales
visiting us this morning @ Polnell Point in Oak Harbor, WA. These two swam around for a while, then headed toward Mariner's Cove. After they left, we saw a possible third spout near Polnell Point. Thanks! Simply awestruck. -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA - photos by Greg Parham -

They have been regulars here for several weeks and are thrilling to see and hear! We are 170 feet up. Polnell Point in the background. -Suzanne Sewester

Hi! I know we aren't doing live whale sightings so I wanted to share two grey whales off
Kayak Point
about
1:30pm today. Looked like a mother and her baby. (added info per Hannah: They were headed north into the crook of Camano Island (toward Stanwood). It looked like they were feeding. They stayed in the area for about 30min before they swam north and we couldn't see them anymore. They were very playful. The smaller one likes to flip their tail out of the water a lot. It was super cool to see! Thanks for letting me know about the smaller one. They were both so in sync when they came up for air, and yes, the other one was much smaller. I love to learn new things. I'll have to read about greys more, I don't know a lot about them. Hope you all have a great day!! Thanks for doing what you guys do!) -photo by Hannah McCullough

We live in the very NW corner of the historical boundary of the
Tulalip Rez
. I was just asking Susan if she knew if the Grays were still present as we had not seen them in a few weeks, after seeing them daily in April. We just watched two big Grays swimming up into Port Susan, showing lots of tail as they sounded for the depths. Heading to feed on ghost shrimp in the shallows of the estuary, no doubt. Gorgeous day! -Douglas Barlow

Entry 9:
Port Susan -

10:00-

11:00 -
We had
2 grey whales
in here at the south east end of Camano in Port Susan sound on
May 7th. I think I forgot to let your group know. They were going south between 10 and 11. One very large and one a bit smaller. I wrote it on the calendar but then forgot. But we have not seen whales since that day so I have a feeling that the time has passed for their visits. I hope this has been helpful. -Terri and Tom Smith
