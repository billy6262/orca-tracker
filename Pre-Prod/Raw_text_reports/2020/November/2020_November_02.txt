Sunset whales in fading light between
Foulweather Bluff

16:50 - Orcas heading south. Mutiny Bay
as seen from Shore Meadows. Some tail slaps and breaching. Not sure if trailers or leaders yet. Mid channelish. -Sandra Pollard

16:27 -
Carla Bradshaw (Susan & Howie's neighbor) called to report seeing the orcas as a result of their text. They are out on the bluff. First, they saw 2 individuals traveling south from
Bush Pt. Road
. They observed a lot of frolicking, estimate at least 7 individuals, but not all together; 3 traveling south fast. Now two groups of 2-3 right in front of us mid channel traveling south.

Unknown number of orcas out from
Bush Point
headed south. Right Now. -Paula Flores

16:15 -
The first orca I saw was at
4:15, really close to Whidbey side (about
1 mile south of Bush Pt
.). By the time I got down to look from the top of the bluff they had moved further outâ€¦ They seemed really spread out and were moving south mid-channel, by

4:45 they were past Foulweather Bluff
and some to between Skunk Bay/Mutiny bay. Saw one directional change and heard lots of tail lobs so doing some foraging, but seemed to be traveling rather quickly and with purpose southward. Heard what sounded like a breach while listening to them on the hydrophone.

15:40 - Southern Resident calls
getting louder, first heard a few minutes ago, around
3:40 pm!
J pod calls
confirmed. Just so wonderful to hear them on the Hps, and again hear them breathing and lob tailing as they passed by, even though they were hard to see in the distance and low light. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
