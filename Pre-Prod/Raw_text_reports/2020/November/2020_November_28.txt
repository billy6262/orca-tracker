14:33 - [orcas]
Spotted blows at
2:33 pm from the walking bridge at
Point Defiance
. Just off the
tip of Maury
using binoculars.
--- I was at the
Wilson Way pedestrian bridge at Point Defiance yesterday viewing the orcas
â€¦ I started seeing them through my binoculars around
3:00pm and first noticed some blows off the tip of Maury Island and then noticed one large breach around
3:15pm in between Maury and Browns Point, more in the middle of the channel. They were continuing southbound and seemed like there were 3-4. The male seemed to stay more mid channel near a large container ship while two others (what looked like a female and calf possibly) went through Dalco Passage and stayed near the orange research boat for a while and were swimming near the Vashon ferry as well. They eventually went back towards where the male was in the middle of the channel in between Ruston and Browns Point near the container ship. I left around
4:34pm as they continued in to Commencement Bay and it was getting dark. -Sally Milligan-Smith
