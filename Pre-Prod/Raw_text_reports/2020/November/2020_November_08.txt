Location:
Orcas Island ferry terminal
and surrounding area.
# of whales: 2 (1 male, 1 female)
. I was on the Anacortes --> Orcas Island ferry yesterday. Around 1230, as we neared the ferry terminal, it stopped and the captain alerted us of a "bull adult orca" off of the front. I sprinted with my camera to the front of the boat. I caught sight of the bull and, a few minutes later, spotted a second orca. It looked female judging by its size and dorsal fin. The whales played in front of the ferry and eventually moved behind it. The captain was Whale Wise, and did a good job of maintaining distance from the whales. We were able to disembark and spent ~30 minutes viewing the whales from shore. They presumably moved west into the San Juan Channel and we lost sight of them. -Zack DiMarco
