Orca Sightings for November 19, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Puget Sound
-

16:36 - Steady northbound travel in tight group.

16:29 - [SRKWs]
In Seattle ferry lanes, group of 5+, foraging, northbound.
(next-day addition: When watching the orcas last night near Blakely Rock, it really seemed like there was at least 1 male and 1 female in predatory feeding behavior around a bunch of hauled out seals on the rock. Really thought it looked like Transient behavior. Then found the Residents just north and east in a tight group, heading north. Wondered if it was 2 pods.) -Chris Merritt

We can just make them out, looking towards Kingston from above
Golden Gardens
(with Long-Range Observation Binoculars). They have been moving around, but currently there is a lot of surface activity near Apple Cove PT. The commercial traffic has been really good about slowing down. -Hays Clark

11:47 -
There are still whales off of
Point Wells
fuel tanks, mid channel
heading south
.

11:40 -
Later is heading south now at a pretty good clip. Look for the coast guard boat; he's just in front, maybe a bit west.

11:39 -
They are spread out off of
Kingston
, don't seem to be moving at any direction, maybe slowly south. There are barges, container ships. They're staying down for a long time. I haven't seen much activity.

11:26 -
Leader is straight out from
Kingston
, looks like fishing. I'm looking across at fuel tanks from the top of this hill. Still whales quite to the north, all heading south

11:09 -
I see the two males, coast guard boat and chopper right behind them, and there's a ferry heading that way hopefully someone alerted them. I'm on the hill above the Kingston ferry. -Jim Pasola

11:00 -
Sara Frey called, she has been watching 2 large males (Sara's back-of-camera image confirms
J27 Blackberry
as one - alb) who have been hanging around off
Apple Tree Point
. Others have passed by spread out from Kitsap side to mid channel, some breaching further in the distance. She does not see any more to the north, so believes all are to the south of her and others south of the ferry lanes, off Kingston. The two males have now moved on, as well. (The two boys hung out for about 10-15 minutes.)

10:28 - [SRKWs]
West shipping lanes,
