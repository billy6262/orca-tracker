============================================================

Entry 1:

15:30 -
Flew over at about
3:30 saw them from 5000 ft. Obvious blows, super cool. That's the whale watching boat in the middle of the frame. -Neil Hathi

15:20 -
Left them at
3:20 pm, ever so slowly northbound almost up to
Fort Worden
(looking from Ft. Casey). Long down times, spectacular day out there. Another treat today - distant views of
J-pod members
as they
headed north out of Admiralty Inlet. J-26 Mike
was the closest to Whidbey - with others spread out and foraging mid-channel as they traveled. NOAA Research was with them. We watched from Bush Point, Lagoon Point and Fort Casey, such a beautiful but chilly day. We were also entertained by at least 30 noisy Steller sea lions at Fort Casey, lots of socially distanced on-lookers. All images heavily cropped!!! -Jill Hein

Fort Flagler. Nb

Pretty sure all orcas have passed southend of Lagoon Pt. now. Research boat was with them. NB. (Have been watching Mike [J26] at that time I posted. And he was our last one. Can phone cover that far from BP To LP. Interesting. I'm still at Lagoon but heading to Ledgewood. From southend Lagoon Pt. he appeared to be out from the
northend of Lagoon Pt
. Pretty sure he was our last one, at that time (
13:30).)

The same small
humpback
, I could make out the distinctive 3 white "dots" on its right side, northbound past Edwards Point (I missed its southern return from its last position to the north).

08:25-

08:46 - The young humpback
changed direction heading north, milling just
south of Edwards Point
. At
08:32 it came in close 100 yds from the shoreline and slowly swam between my position on the shore and some seals lounging on a rock. The seals all froze and stared at the whale as it poked around in the cove. Surfacing many times, it left the cove heading north out past Edwards Point.
