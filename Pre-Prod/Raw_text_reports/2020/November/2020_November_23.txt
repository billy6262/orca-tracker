Entry 2:
San Juan Islands (T68Cs, T75Bs)
- Coming down Upright Channel we met
7 whales
: the T68Cs (4 whales -
T68C born 1992 and her 3 offspring T68C1, T68C3 and T68C4 of 13, 8, and 4 years of age) and T75Bs (3 whales - T75B born 1995 and her 2 juveniles T75B2 and T75B3 of 5 and 3 years of age)
. We were able to drift nearby as they were engaged in a hunt, probably a harbor seal, and there was much excitement in the group with breaches and tails in the air. Continuing North West they passed the entrance to Friday Harbor and hugged the shoreline of the University property towards Point Caution. Suddenly the mood changed and they charged towards us in a line. A Steller sea lion surfaced next to our boat and began high speed swimming to and fro the length of the hull. Whales breached and lunged inches from the bow as we drifted on the calm waters. They appeared to be hunting 2 Steller sea lions and appeared to be successful with at least one of them. After sharing their meal, they came close to shore and headed North inches from the shoreline beneath the watching university students. Again, they appeared to be having fun with pec slaps and tails in the air. photo - "T68Cs and T75Bs passing Friday Harbor" - photo - "Biggs Orca chasing Steller Sea Lion" - photo - "T68Cs and T75Bs traveling close to shore" -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

What a difference a day makes! The sun was shining on the
T068Cs and T075Bs
who were spotted off of Turn Island this morning by a ferry passenger. Jeff wanted to take a look since we were on the water anyway. Additional info sent us into Upright and their path. Coming down from Lopez, they turned to
Shaw Island
and some beautiful markings on
T068C1
's saddle confirmed our guess. The
T068s and T075Bs
are still in the island waters. They didn't travel far today, but were very showy during a seal predation. photos - "
