I am reporting a group of
orcas traveling north from Sandy Point to Downtown Langley
on the Camano Island coast (closer to Camano than Whidbey Island) at
12:30 Friday 11/20. -Maya Rivera
*

16:30 -
So I went south preemptively. Looks like they just milled in area
between Hidden Beach and Baby Island
, perhaps foraging for a bit. Now seems like they've grouped up a little bit, are now on Whidbey side north of
Hidden Beach, traveling north
.

15:35 -
In the area of Hidden Beach, looks like they've flipped and are southbound.

November 20: Patience rewarded. A few whales have passed
Fox Spit northbound
.
11.30 -
Group of 4 or 5 whales and 2 lone whales including single adult male, have passed
Brighton beach between Whidbey and Hat Island
steady northbound. Whale karma has returned at last with the arrival of J pod in Saratoga Passage, Whidbey Island. Our first encounter with the whales was seeing a number of whales, well-spread out, pass Brighton Beach heading north between Whidbey and Hat Island. Although they appeared to be in steady travel mode as they rounded Sandy Point, it was some time before they made a further appearance off Fox Spit, testing whale watchers' spotting skills and endurance on a blustery day. But, as always, it was worth every shiver just to see this unique population of orcas, so deserving of the efforts being made to protect them both now and in the future. photo - "A member of J pod passing Brighton Beach on a cool, blustery morning."

Orcas in Henderson Bay, Carr Inlet,
around noon today,
November 20, 2020. They were close to the west shore, playful, lots of headstands, heading south towards Glen Cove. We had lots of sea lions in the bay, I am sure that's what they were after! -Ingrid Shumway
