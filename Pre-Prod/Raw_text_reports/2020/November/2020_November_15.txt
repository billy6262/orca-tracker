Orca Sightings for November 15, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
13:30 - 2 orcas
in the Strait on Sunday, Nov 15 at 1330, about
2 miles west of Pt. Wilson
. One appeared to be a male with a dorsal fin approximately 6 ft high. We watched them for about 30 minutes. They appeared to be
moving in a westerly direction
, but possibly feeding. -Kent Hitchings

Entry 2:
16:15 -
Last update for the night. I watched the Bigg's continue northbound, spread in at least two groups east side of the channel. Last observed them out from
Meadow Point, Golden Gardens
(~ 47.695387, -122.429203).

16:00 -
I moved down to the parking lot by the beach. Biggs's are loosely spread; they had been traveling up in a line, but are now grouping up in at least two groups heading slowly northbound directly out from
southernmost end of Golden Gardens Park
on the east side of channel (~ 47.68790,-122.42259). Shallow surfaces, blows and dorsal slightly visible with naked eye, binoculars needed for optimal viewing in the chop. Super cold and windy as sun begins to descend behind the clouds.

15:40 - Transients are off West Point, Discovery Park
, heading northbound close in, male and few others passed right at green buoy off the lighthouse (~ 47.65920,-122.44239). I was happily surprised to see blows on this side of the Sound, just to the south of West Point. It was so pretty to see the male's dorsal glide in the sunbeam when he was passing right off the buoy.

Sunset Hill Park, Ballard
