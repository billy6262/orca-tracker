Here are the pictures from
K's and J's east side Vashon Island
pass yesterday, it was very heartwarming to see them as usual! It seemed like a rather subdued pass this time, didn't see too much foraging, mainly just leisurely steady southbound travel in two big loose groups with rests in between. Bouncy little J pod babes in the mix, so cute and bubbly, got lots of deep sighs of contentment from the crowd. They bring so much joy in their wake, I really hope somehow they can feel all the love radiating from here on the shore. The grouped up pics that are from far away are from Dilworth and the rest of them are from the
point [Robinson]

I just caught a glimpse of KW of east side of Bainbridge around
Skiff Point

Entry 3:
North Puget Sound - ~

15:30 -
We believe the pod was 5 in total with what looked to be a small calf. They passed by us just north of
President Point

2-3 orcas

Just now.
14:47. Southbound. At least three. -Barbara Gamrath
[
Confirmed with Barbara, they did see three separate dorsal fins, so looks like another group of orcas was off Shilshole at some point. She is aware of the humpback being in the area. -alb

14:15 -
"Believe
T137A?
Have right and left saddle of the male. Just

southbound
on the west side of shipping lanes, booking south. While we were on the phone, she saw a total of at least 2, 5-6 orcas. Someone breaching. -Sara Frey
*

Entry 5:
15:25 - Two large blows off Carkeek
. Observed just as I entered Eagle Harbor. Not sure of species or travel direction. Poor sighting conditions. Rain and lots of waves. FYI: my instincts on this are large whale/humpback. Tall columnar blow, but I'm not certain. -Michelle Savoie
