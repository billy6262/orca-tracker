Orca Sightings for November 4, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
(J pod) -

21:33 -
There was only one detection reported by humans and it was quite a bit later:
21:33 at
Bush Point
. At the time, there were 4 folks listening to Bush Point. Interestingly there were no subsequent detections at Port Townsend, so I'm wondering if they snuck out on the north shore of Admiralty, or may have doubled back at some point... Scott Veirs,
Orcasound

Black fins heading south from
Edmonds ferry
. Too far to see
12:35. Viewing from Edmonds ferry terminal. (update: I know this is old now, but I only saw 1-2 spouts (looked too small to be humpback) and black fins which appeared to be orca. I couldn't stay with them long but they were just south of the terminal between the terminal and the pier in Edmonds. I can't speak to where they headed or if they stalled/changed direction.) -Karen Sziel
