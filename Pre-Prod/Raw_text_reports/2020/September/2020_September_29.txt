18:15 -
Reporting from
Lagoon Pt
. about
6:15..mid channel distant blows and big splashes..but so lovely to see dear J pod!!! I heard they had just passed Bush Point northbound, I decided to dash down to Lagoon Point (vs. staying home and watching the debate...turns out to have been an excellent choice!)....just as I pulled into the north side beach, there they were, distant mid-channel, but oh so lovely in the setting sun with backlit blows and some huge splashes. Even though they were pretty far off, it was wonderful to see them! -Bonnie Gretz
*

17:30 - Orcas, Bush Point
. Mid channel and heading north. Still breaching. Too far out to identify but there's a boat with them. -Camille Hartely

17:00 -
This was at
Bush Point
on the west side of Whidbey island last night at about
5:00 PM and yes we were fishing for Coho, no luck though as there were tons of sea lions, and the orcas in the area we did see mama and her baby we also did see a few orca with salmon in their mouth as they breached, could not tell what kind of salmon but they were large enough to be Kings/Chinook. Added: Yes all boats in the area shut down and stayed out of the 400 yard mark minus the time the orca came in really close to us on their own while we were dead in the water waiting for them to pass. -Clayton Carlson
*

17:50 -
Soon approaching
Lagoon Pt.
about 1/2 mile south. Close to Whidbey, and some mid channel.

17:15 - Passed Bush Pt. Lighthouse
, crazy active, close to Shore, northbound.

16:50 - [J pod] Viewing from Shore Meadows
..lots surface activity closer to Whidbey and just a tad west of Shore Meadows (Whidbey), NB. -Marilyn Armbruster
*
Boom...crack... The unmistakable sound of breaching, tail-slapping orcas echoing across
Admiralty Inlet
, interspersed with the rhythmic 'whoosh' of exhalations, broke the quiet of early evening as, with sunset approaching, a sedate procession of northbound
J pod Southern Residents
passed close to shore at
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, on
September 29. The proximity of the whales to the beach made this yet another breathtaking encounter with this unique species - magnificent yet so fragile. All of us lucky enough to be in the moment will undoubtedly treasure the memory. -Sandra Pollard and Richard Snowberger
*
Tonight was freaking incredible. Rushed to
Bush Point
right after work and made it without a minute to spare. Watched J Pod in a fairly close pass with some of my human pod and then met up again at Lagoon Point. Finished the night watching repeated breaches at Ft. Casey with Rachel as the sun met the incoming smoky skies- totally magical. -Dori Dace
*

16:50 - [J pod]
1 mile off Whidbey shoreline,
2 miles south of Bush Point
, headed north
4:50pm. -David Scott
*

18:00 -
Straight out from Lagoon Point now. Super active.

16:45 - [J pod]
Seeing a lot of breaches + splashing. I'm viewing through a really long lens from Marrowstone, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly where, but it looks like they're maybe just
outside of Mutiny Bay
. -Sara Montour Lewis
*

16:59 -
Traveling west now, just saw a BUNCH of breaches, cartwheels, and tail lobs! They are a mile or so
south of Bush Point
now.

16:25 -
They are now west of the green channel marker, and appear to be continuing west to possibly head out Admiralty, looks like they are
off south Mutiny Bay
at this point.

15:10 -
They are definitely finding some fish there, have now
turned back NE
!

14:50 - [J pod]
We were able to finally see blows from our Big Eyes, from HQ just
south of Bush Pt., between Double Bluff/Pt. No Point
area, at first looked like they were heading NW toward Admiralty Inlet, but then turned and seemed to be heading south toward Pt. No Point, just east of the green channel marker. But now at 3 pm, it appears they are foraging, and have grouped up east of the green marker, so not sure where they will go from there! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

14:01 -
There are still a couple
headed north/northwest, north of PNP
…

12:54 -
Spread out. At least three midway
between Point No Point and Southern tip of Whidbey
. Head north.

12:45 - [J pod]
A number of them still
East of PNP
. Near a small boat. -Julius Raymond
*

15:44 -
Drifted west again. Hard to tell if it's directional changes or if they're planning on continuing that way. Definitely a lot of surface activity.

15:38 -
So many breaches! Still in relatively the same spot. Really close to the Whidbey side.

14:25 -
Still seeing far away blows
between the point at PNP and point at Double Bluff
. From what I could tell, about 6 females or so, one juvenile or baby, and one male.
*
this group has been moving pretty slow. I don't know that it's the entire J-pod, though. I'm wondering where the rest of them are.

13:12 -
They've been milling [map indicating three groups spread from
south to west of Maxwelton
-gs]. There's a container ship coming through.

12:57 - Spotted one SE of PNP
.

12:43 -
They're very spread out. Just saw two breaches eastward mainland. Seeing another thin milling
Northeast toward Whidbey
.

12:24 -
A few orcas milling. Looking directly
east from PNP
. Decently far out there. Possibly one male, definitely one or two females. -Ashley Whitman
*

12:13 - Js spread south of Point No Point
milling as of 5 minutes ago. We're passing on the opposite side of the channel to search for more wildlife. Edit #1: they saw
both new calves (J57 & J58)
and they're looking great! Edit #2: On
J56 Tofino
: "Quite healthy! She looks so white compared to the little pink babies. She was
with J31 and J39
." -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

09:59 - Orca
pod breaching so much,
Kingston-Edmonds ferry run
, heading toward Picnic Point. -Charisse Berni
*
Orca Network alerted WSF and commercial shipping traffic. We appreciate the efforts and care by WSF. At

09:54
Marie Waterman WSF, Marine Ops replied: "WALLA WALLA reports they
[J pod]
are just to the
north of the ferry lanes
and the vessel came to an "all stop" while they were close."
*

09:55 - A dozen or more
orcas north bound off of Apple Cove Point
, in the shipping lanes closer to Kitsap side.

09:45 - Two orcas breaching off of Point Edwards
and several more splashing between there and the Kingston ferry terminal. -Sherman Page
*

10:11 -
Sara Frey called again. She is seeing a
small group very close to Kitsap side off Apple Tree Point
. Group includes large male with open saddle on left side and large female. Reported
heading up towards Eglon
, but maybe then sounded like they circled back again so making directional changes. She could see larger group in the distance near the southbound traffic lanes/mid channel, some breaching.

10:03 -
Few on Kitsap side including one large male and female heading
towards Point No Point
at the moment, rest are spread out behind. Continuing to breach.

09:37 - Sara Frey called to report seeing
15+ orcas spread out in all direction near the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes
. At the time
some south of the oil dock (Woodway)
Mostly mid to west of. Big male mid channel. As we were talking, she was seeing breach after breach after breach including by young ones. Tail lobs etc. By numbers believe residents but can't see saddle patches. -Sara Frey
*

09:11 - Orcas off of Jeff Head out in the middle moving northbound
. Had a definite count of three that we're on one side of my boat, but out in the middle there was another group so I really don't have a good number for you. -Chris Boucher

HUMPBACKS - Tue, Sept 29 - Puget Sound -
~

10:30 -
This morning about
10:30 while fishing, we saw
at least two Humpback Whales in Commencement Bay
. They were near the big, unloaded, tanker and appeared to be heading towards Tacoma. I only saw the fluke of one Humpback, but saw two breathing spouts (?). No pictures. We are going to the same area in about an hour so IF we see them again we'll get a picture. -Carl Straub
*
Tue, Sept 29 - E Strait of Georgia - I had
2 Humpbacks
here as well at
1:30pm they were travelling east from the below map pin [49°01'08.1"N 123°25'11.3"W] -

10:15 - Two humpbacks
, travelling south. [seen
west of Point Roberts near the Tsawwassen ferry lane
]. -Melissa Hafting
*
GRAY WHALES - Tue, Sept 29 - Possession Sound - We also found
Gray Whale #2259
on the delta. [
Snohomish Delta near Tulalip/Everett/Hat Island
]. -Justine Buckmaster
*
Tue, Sept 29 - Northern Saratoga Passage -

12:45 -
Annnnnnndddd, we're back to
Utsalady
where
Gray
was 3-4 hours ago. A full round-trip. Gray is motoring along northward fairly rapidly. It's hard to tell exactly how far between Camano and Whidbey it is, but I'm going to guess about halfway, maybe closer to Camano. Depth perception over the water is tough - lol. As of
12:45pm, it is approaching the red marker in the bay at Utsalady, and I think it's going to pass on the Camano side of it, if that helps at all.

11:00 -
Updates for Gray 2261! It's been a busy whale this morning, making the rounds. It hung out between Mariners Cove and Utsalady for a long time - until around 11, when it finally moved north up into Skagit Bay. From there, it made a bee-line for
Mariners Cove
, cruising in at a good clip around
11:30am and getting reasonably close to shore. It didn't linger, but swam pretty quickly down to the happy meal mudflats, where it spent the last half hour or so feeding and slowly working its way down the shoreline. By 12 noon, I thought maybe it was heading down to Polnell but it appears to have turned out into the channel again.

09:00 -
I just spotted
Gray
(assuming 2261) in a big wall mirror of all things - lol. It's currently mid-channel
between Mariners Cove and the southern end of Utsalady
. Appeared to be heading north at first, but has turned and is now southbound. (half hour later) Appears to be just hanging out just south of Utsalady as of
9:25. Every time I look, it's heading a different direction - lol. Now it's creeping north back toward Utsalady. Maybe it's just going in big circles. Spending time observing this magnificent whale has been such a gift, especially in this crazy year. I'm going to miss it when it decides to head for warmer waters, but I will be eternally grateful to my big gray friend,
CRC 2261
, for allowing me (on an almost daily basis!) to take a short break from the whirlwind of everyday life and become immersed in the power and awesomeness of nature. -Marianne Parry
