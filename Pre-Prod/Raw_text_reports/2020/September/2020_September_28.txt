Orca Sightings for September 28, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
20:25-

20:50 -
Counting and following exhalation locations approximately
8-10 K-Pod members slowly southbound
. Listening in full dark the exhalations were unique to each individual; deep, soft, drawn out or forceful with one individual having a distinctive whistle on inhalation- like blowing across the top of a soda bottle when we were kids. Orca Behavior Institute identified the whistler as K42 Kelp.

19:55-

20:20 - Lime Kiln Hydrophone beginning with clicks and whistles
, soon the calls became louder and varied as they passed southward. Another night of peaceful beauty standing in the dark under the stars, listening to K-Pod draw breaths as they pass. (
1/4 mile south of Edwards Point, SJI
) -Michelline Halliday, SJI

19:15 - About 10 Ks foraging at Kellett

K Pod
came
down Boundary with a pass by Turn Point Light

Just
south of Eglon

17:20 -
Seems split in two active foraging groups. Line of sight is

Half an hour ago, straight out from

14:52 -
Heading
southbound from Possession Point

14:45 - [J pod]
Seeing exhales at
Possession Point
from Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach. Appear to be heading northwest. Can't see them without binoculars. -Tamara Kelley-Woods
*

14:14 - [J pod]
A number of whales have passed Glendale spread across channel towards
Clinton Mukilteo ferry lanes
. Steady pace. Some breaches. North bound. ---I can't think of any better wake-up call than the Orca call, and knowing that the Southern Residents were heard on the Bush Point hydrophones last night, this morning's heads up of their potential presence was a bonus. Even so they teased us with wondering whether their travels would take them up Admiralty Inlet or toward Saratoga Passage, Whidbey Island. With little time to spare we caught up with them as they approached Glendale and the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes. The brief but beautiful encounter as they passed by, with an occasional explosive breach to break up the steady, sedate pace, was a reminder of nature's grandeur and our great fortune to be witness to it. -Sandra Pollard
*

15:00 -
They look like they are heading
Edmonds
, at least 10 of them. Near the green buoy off the southern tip of Whidbey as of
3:00.

14:35 -
They are heading south again, towards the
southern tip of Whidbey
. They changed direction.

13:51 -
They are half way between
southern tip of Whidbey

Last I saw they were heading south of
Elgon
. Literally the exact same path they took to get to this side. I lost them in the sunshine now.

5:30 -
They are all heading back
towards Kitsap side
. Still midchannel but heading west there.

15:15 -
Still midchannel, appear to be trending Southwest. Same direction they originally came from. Exhalations seen spread out. (South of Whidbey in the open waters.)

13:15 -
Looks like they may be
committed to Possession
.

12:58 -
They look bigger through my scope from Mukilteo so looks like they are headed east.

12:50 -
There's several small groups all over.

12:45 - [J pod]
They're really hanging in the middle of the water and haven't moved much. Lots of activity and breaching. (Viewing through telescope from Mukilteo.) -Alice Thuy Talbot

Tears of happiness to see members of J-pod on the south end of Whidbey yesterday [9/28], first time in 2020 I've seen any SR's. They were very spread out, and surface active. All images zoomed and heavily cropped. We left them trending towards Possession Sound around
12:30 pm.

GRAY WHALES - Mon, Sept 28 -
Northern Saratoga Passage -

10:30 -
Update on Gray's location: Gray hung out at "upper" Utsalady until a few minutes ago (was there for about an hour), and is now headed back north toward the
northern tip of Camano
as of
11:30am. Yay! So glad it's still around! Coincidentally, 9/28 was the last date I spotted a gray back in 2018 when 2234(?) was here all summer.

10:15 -
About 25 min later (
10:15), Gray is motoring
down Saratoga Passage
and has passed the northern tip of Camano. Just north of
Utsalady
at the moment and hustling right along. Appears to be mid-channel-ish.

09:50 -
I am watching a Gray (likely
2261
) waaaay out in
Skagit Bay
. Just got lucky with looking in the right place at the right time - lol. I whipped out my handy compass app and the whale is directly east of my location at
Mariners cove
. I can't tell exactly where it's heading - in binocs, I can see the body when it spouts and it appears to be going north, but isn't making a lot of progress distance-wise so might be moving more toward me. -Marianne Parry
*
Mon, Sept 28 - Possession Sound - We … went to
Gedney Island
and found
gray whales #2261 and #2259
. They met up and then travelled together for a bit, giving us a few close passes! -Janine Harles
