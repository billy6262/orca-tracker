T018 and T019B
, Mark was able to locate
T019 and T019C
well south of the pair, and they appeared to be surfacing in unison with T018 and T019B even though they were separated by ~ 2 nm. Both pairs were traveling around 4 knots and doing long dives from 6 - 8 minutes. …" [See CWR Encounter #51 for full encounter summary and more photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-51

Mon, Sept 21 -
Haro Strait (T60s and T123s) -
With the smoke making an exit from the area and clear skies returning once again, we made our way out into the Salish sea. Our journey started at Pointer island where we found a few harbor seals hanging out before we tucked into the San Juan islands. We cruised west through the islands getting great looks at porpoise and a lot of sea birds as we traveled along. Soon we were heading south along Haro strait and joining up with members of the T60 and T123 Bigg's orca whale families. -Tyson, Island Adventures (Anacortes)

GRAY WHALES - Mon, Sept 21 - Northern Saratoga Passage -

16:28 - Gray is passing by Mariners Cove
now, moderately far out into the channel but much closer to Whidbey than Camano, heading northbound. It's very much like yesterday in terms of trajectory (toward Strawberry Point). I would guess that it's doing some bottom-feeding out there because it's making pretty slow progress. So hard to track when it only pops up every couple of minutes - lol! Stealth Gray. -Marianne Parry

MINKE WHALES - Mon, Sept 21 - On
Smith Bank we found a minke whale
and we were able to drift as the whale circled us with beautiful views with the calm waters reflecting the skyscapes over the Olympic Mountains. Drifting between Turn Island and Turn Rock we heard the blow of a rather large minke whale. We paralleled for a while as he travelled South.
