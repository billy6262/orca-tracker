Observed from 1/2 mile
south of Edwards Point north towards Landbank
. As
all 3 pods gathered
, 73 individuals traveled leisurely north, some spread out and some in groups.
They socialized while milling back and forth; some moving north past Edwards Point. Twice I heard vocalizations
as they called to friends and family at the surface. Many floated on their backs or drifted upright. Sea snakes were displayed for companions. Gentle stretching spyhops and a few tail lobs were observed. After sunset at
20:04 they changed direction and moved with purpose to the south. There was celebration in the air. It was communicated all along the shore inviting all watchers to join in. Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

21:45 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #40 (Sequence 2 & 3): " … While we were working this group, we got a call over the radio from "Kestrel" saying that it looked like
J35 had had her calf
. We left the group and headed about a quarter mile northeast of the other whales to where the J35s were.
J35 had indeed had her calf!
It had not been there on the morning of
September 3rd. Its' dorsal fin was not flopped over so the calf was
probably born somewhere between the evenings of the 3rd and 4th. J35, the new calf J57, and J47
were non-directional and made a big circle before slipping back over the Canadian border. We decided to give them some peace and quiet and went to find other whales. … " [See CWR Encounter #40 (Sequence 2 & 3) for full encounter summary and more photos] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-40-2-3

Center for Whale Research Encounter #40 (Sequence 1): "… As Mark was passing south of Trial Island, he got word that the whale watch fleet saw the incoming group approaching at the southeast corner of Coyote Bank. Mark decided to turn and head for the trailing main concentration of
K's and L's, which were now slightly southwest of Race Rocks
still spread out and
moving slowly east
. He started the encounter at
1405
when he came across
K21 eastbound leading the procession 1nm south of Race Rocks
(48 17.0/123 30.8). There were a few groups that were quite animated and were generally pointed northeast towards Constance Bank. …" [See CWR Encounter #40 (Sequence 1) for full encounter summary and photos] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-40-1
