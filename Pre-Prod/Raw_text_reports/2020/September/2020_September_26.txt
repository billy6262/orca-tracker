I'm so excited to be watching
Gray 2261 go by Mariners Cove!
! It's feeding pretty heavily and very slowly working its way to the happy meal mudflats, pretty close to shore. It's zigging and zagging but progressing southward gradually. I keep thinking it's turning out into the channel but then it turns right back toward shore again. -Marianne Parry
