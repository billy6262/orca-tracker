Sat, Sept 12 - San Juan Islands
(T123s) -
We headed up into the
Strait of Georgia
after that, along the outside of the outer islands toward
Alden bank
. We met up with the T123 Bigg's orca whales on the south end of the bank and settled in for a show. As the whales traveled, they exhibited many behaviors that would be consistent with hunting and we did see a few harbor porpoise swim relatively close to the orca whales. We left the whales as they continued north and headed over to Clements reef to check out a big group of Steller sea lions. Continuing to search the area after that, we received a call the whales had turned south and so we joined them one last time. This time they were getting into a resting pattern as we followed along with them. We waved goodbye to the T123's and cruised the shores of Lummi Island where Captain Scott found us two adult bald eagles perched in the trees. -Tyson, Island Adventures (Anacortes)
