We were lucky enough to have

17:55 -
Back through the pass and headed out.

14:22 -
I just saw
2 beautiful orcas swim down the Skagit Bay
off of Oak Harbor/Whidbey Island. They were headed East and taking their time cruising along. A couple of whale watching boats with tourists was viewing them but giving the precious whales plenty of open space. I wanted to be sure to report it to you! -Trisha Ferreira, Oak Harbor, WA

After tail lobbing along the north side as they
headed out Deception Pass

Still steady

----Today was my fifth time seeing orcas head under Deception Pass - except they tricked me, and headed west out the smaller Canoe Pass. I had to race in my car to the other side, but still managed to get a few photos.

12:30 - Bigg's Transients T37As
off northeast Whidbey south of
Ala Spit County Park and Hope Island
. Currently stalled, had been southbound. [per ALB]
*
Wednesday the ninth, orcas were spotted in the
Dewey Beach
area having come through
Deception Pass
and went over to the Hope Island area and then eventually around Hope island where I lost sight. They were in the distance so hard to see how many. At
5:30 that afternoon I spotted them again along the North shore of Whidbey Island by the old ferry terminal. A sailboat was watching them. This time I counted it seem to be at least five. With a juvenile or two. They had it out past Deception Pass where I can no longer see them around the corner of Yokeko point. They were heading to the pass for dinner I'm sure! I'm sure the sighting has been reported and they were so distant I wasn't able to make any possible identifications. But it was still lots of fun! Watching them feed the North Shore of Whidbey was really fun even from across the bay. -Wendy Bents Patterson

Saw a pod of four (we think) heading towards
Deception Pass

DOLPHINS - Wed, Sept 9 -

09:30 -
My parents believe they saw
Cinco in Gig Harbor
at
9:30am today (Sept 9). They said there was only one dolphin, it had a fin, and looked like the dolphins they saw in Tampa. (Hales Passage, not Gig. They're from out of town.) Additional info: [Moving] southeast. Toward Point Fosdick. When I asked my dad about its behavior, he said it was swimming at a leisurely pace and looked almost as if it were looking for fish.
