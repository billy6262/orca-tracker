Orca Sightings for September 22, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tue, Sept 22 - Strait of Georgia - I took these photos on Wednesday the 22nd with Maya's Legacy. The residents were all heading south just
past point Roberts
. We mainly were observing the
J pod and got to see the new baby, j57
socially interacting and spyhopping. The k and L's were in the area too. The J's were actively feeding for well over an hour with many successful hunts. I even was able to grab a shot with a salmon in one of the whale's mouths. There was lots of "cuddling going on" and surface vocalization. wakeuptoadventure FB page

MINKE WHALES - Tue, Sept 22 -
Between Partridge and Smith we found a minke whale!
Or rather, it found us when it surfaced off our port side. We slowed and waited to see where it would resurface, tracking its fluke prints as it swam shallow beneath the surface. We stayed with this little minke for some time, watching as it circled the banks. It had some pretty dramatic scarring along its dorsal ridge, likely left by cookie-cutter sharks, so will be interesting to see if we can find a match with the minkes we've encountered previously this season. -Sam, Island Adventures
