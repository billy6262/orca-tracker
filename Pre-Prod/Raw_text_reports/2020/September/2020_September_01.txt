Center for Whale Research Encounter #38: … "Orcinus" arrived on scene at about
1220
and soon got on some whales about 3/4s of a mile
off Pile Point. J16, J19, J36, J37, and J49
briefly formed up in a tight group heading slowly down island. J49 was being very active and did several half breaches. Two other females were spread out inshore of this group. A few minutes later,
J26
showed up out of nowhere and began chasing a salmon. The group broke up and began milling in the same area.
J42
showed up, logged at the surface, and then rolled over to do a pec slap while blowing a raspberry. - [See CWR Encounter #38 for full encounter summary and more photos] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-38

11:34 - It's J Pod!!!!
---And just like magic on the morning of

Entry 2:
J-Pod emerges from the fog on the west side of San Juan Island, with J19 Shachi leading them up Haro Strait

BIGGS/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Tue, Sept 1 -
North Puget Sound (T37As) -

19:50 -
The T37A pod is southbound mid-channel and closer to the Camano Island side seen from
Bells Beach area on Whidbey Island
. They are very spread out across the channel. -Bart Rulon

15:19 -
Bonnie Gretz called. She and Jill Hein are at
Long Point
watching the 4 orcas (2 females, 1 male, 1 calf) who exited Penn Cove. This pod is heading
southbound
towards Camano Island, really slowly far out from Long Point. (Jill thinks is the T37s)

14:50 - [orcas] 4 exiting Penn Cove
north side. A distant breach, and could hear them exhale it was so quiet and glass smooth water. Another beautiful day with distant looks and lovely orcas...caught glimpses of them from Long Point as they were leaving Penn Cove, and they headed slowly southeast toward Camano Island. -Bonnie Gretz

14:40 -
At least 4 and are now going past
Snakelum Point

14:23 -
Orcas about to blow
Coupeville Wharf
! (I am across the Cove by Glencairn pier with binoculars.) -Jesse E Chandler
*

12:25 -
At least two groups/pods of orcas heading north in
between Madrona on Camano and Penn Cove
, Whidbey. The first group of three are probably at Rocky Point by now. I watched them go after a seal. The water was going crazy and all of a sudden a seal went straight up in the air flipping head over tail about 5 times as it went up and then back down into the water with the whales. Then one of them did a spy hop. Following them a bigger pod of 6 or 7. They are doing the same, disappearing in the water for several minutes at a time. They are closer to the Whidbey side in front of Penn Cove. There might be another pod, but not sure if it joined up with the second pod or not. -Wendy Nelson (Camano Whale Watch)

I was excited to see the post regarding the T's in
Case Inlet
this morning. Last night, my husband and I were enjoying a moonlit stroll on our beach,

10:30 -
11:30 pm 9/1; (southeast end of Harstine on Dana Passage) when a pod of 5 orcas swam southbound then reversed course and headed northbound. We didn't bring our phones. One of them has a very distinctive blow, like a human blowing their nose. It was mystical to see the dorsal fins backlit by moonlight! -Cindy Klein

19:00 -
Last night [8/1] between 5 pm and 7pm, there were several
orcas between Nisqually Reach and Anderson Island (Lyle Point)
, heading towards Olympia. There was plenty of spouting and surfacing. Very tall dorsals - I'm guessing based on history that these are Transients. There were at least 5, possibly 6, and it looked like there may have been a baby. I saw them from my yard on Oro Bay. Julie added: I just found out today that my neighbor happened to be out there fishing when the orcas came by, and he said they actually bumped his boat. That must have been a thrill, even for an 82-yr-old. -Julia Roth

It was an upside-down sort of day. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

Craziest pass ever, lol!!! For 20 minutes some going northbound off Point Robinson, some southbound, very close to shore, all have met up now it seems (T65As and T137s) in a confusing and fun pass headed southbound, still Vashon side loosely grouped.

12:00 - T65A's just passed Dilworth
, Vashon side, travel mode south, loosely grouped. --- Craziest pass ever at
Point Robinson
as we were watching a pod drift down from the north headed southbound so all of our eyes were trained north, then out of nowhere, T137A and T137D surface behind us, super close to shore startling all of us, headed Northbound, they catch up with the southbound pod ahead of us, they all start heading south, and then another sub pod comes charging in from the south again, headed north, they finally all meet up, with all of us yelling and pointing at different directions because they are everywhere going in both directions, then they take down a seal, take their meal to go, and all finally head southbound. Whale soup! SO fun, and kept the adrenaline pumping with all the passes being so close to shore, what a rush! Love those wiley T's!! -Marla Smith

13:30 - Gray
doing leisurely feeding off Hunskor Hill, just
east of Mariners Cove
. First spotted at
1:30 pm. Moving towards Mariners Cove now. -Paula Despins
*

23:38 -
I was just finished writing up the email I just sent you from the 5pm sighting when I heard a puff outside! We ran outside and spent a few magical minutes watching and listening to a gray feeding and slowly cruising by
Mariners Cove
…in the light of the full moon on the water!!! It was incredible! What an amazing whale day!

17:00 -
I have a third
2261
sighting to pass along today! We took our little inflatable boat out to go drift and have happy hour down by
Polnell Point
, and on the way we spotted our pal 2261 spouting way over by the shore by the Polnell Shores boat ramp. I only had my iphone, but zoomed in as well as I could - I can't believe how close to the beach the whale appeared to be! Cool to see it from the water side for a change. It hung out on the north side of the spit heading out to Polnell Point for a good half hour and then started working its way back northward. It was interesting to see the slightly different feeding pattern at this beach. At Mariners Cove, there's usually a lot of pec fin waving with the tail fluke popping up here and there - down at Polnell, there seemed to be more tail fluke and less pec. No clue if that's legit or means anything - lol.

14:00 - Gray 2261
popped up again, southbound, at Mariners Cove, and I've been watching it feeding out in the happy meal mudflats for prob about an hour! It lingered a long time in the vicinity of the rocks that stuck way out in the water and are exposed at low tide (just the tips visible now), and finally headed off toward Polnell Shores rather than heading back into the channel. It was beautiful to watch - no boats, no crab pots, pretty calm water, just a whale and his foodies.

11:50 - A gray
just cruised by
Mariners Cove
about a quarter of the way out into the channel, southbound, and appeared to be heading for either the mudflats or Polnell, but now as I'm watching it in binoculars, it has turned left toward Camano (in line with the beach south of Utsalady) and now appears to be doubling back and heading north toward Utsalady. Must have realized the tide was too low on this side. Enjoy your day! -Marianne Parry
