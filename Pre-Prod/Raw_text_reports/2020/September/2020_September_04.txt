Fri, Sept 4 - Hi, just wanted to report that around

15:30
we saw what looked to be a minke whale just off
Indian Beach on Camano
. It was close, but I have never seen one, so I just wanted to report the possibility in case you get any other similar reports! It was heading north and hugging Camano shoreline. (updated with: I would say that the coloring was more tan. Are there many Steller sea lions up in the Saratoga Passage? It was very large but it was heading away from us so we could only see the girth as opposed to the length.)
