----I was on the 2 pm boat coming home. ferry captain stopped boat about 1/4 after leaving port. Taken from mid Brighton Beach looking over towards Everett.
There may have only been 4 orcas.
I could hardly tell from when viewing from ferry and Clinton side as at that time they were crazy active....They were not close to Whidbey, they were at least mid channel and on Muk side. I did watch them with David H from Sandy Point who posted from there. The orcas were over near Tulalip side. barely could see with binocs.

Entry 3:
11:50-

12:15 - The little humpback
was observed 1/4 mile
south of Edwards Point
. It arrived from the south and explored back and forth in a small cove before heading back south again. It is the same young humpback that I've observed in this same location since 11-29. Photo taken from shore, cropped and enlarged. ----The little humpback sustained an injury to its rostrum and an abrasion between its blowhole and dorsal fin sometime between 12-4 and 12-17. I noticed what looked like a rough patch/abrasion on the 14th and was able to get a photo to confirm on the 17th. I contacted Alisa Lemire Brooks at Orca Network and she forwarded the photos to NOAA and Cascadia. Thank you, Alisa! Our best wishes for quick healing for this Little Humpback. Photos, from shore, about 1/2 mile south of Landbank. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
