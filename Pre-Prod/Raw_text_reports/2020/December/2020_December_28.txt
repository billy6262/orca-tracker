Orca Sightings for December 28, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
~

16:00 - [orcas]
Sorry this is old! We saw we think 3 adults and 1 baby in
Bellingham Bay
around
4:00pm
December 28th. They were feeding or something - they were staying on the surface way more than I'm used to seeing. This is the best photo we got of one. They were actually staying a ways away from each other, and at one point two were on one side of our boat and the other was on the other side. Behavior I hadn't seen before. -Jessica Heidemann

Center for Whale Research Encounter #73: "… As they were leaving the dock in Victoria harbour at ~1250 they received a report that there were Bigg's killer whales exiting
Port Angeles harbour
. This made three days in a row that killer whales were spotted there. It was reported that members of the
T064's
were present, and it was believed to be them seen on
December 27th as well. No members of the T064 group had ever been confirmed in the waters of the Salish Sea, and Mark had only encountered them once in southeast Alaska during a Fisheries and Oceans survey during the winter of 2009. Christopher Hanke on Saratoga/ Puget Sound Express out of Port Townsend came across the reported Port Angeles killer whales at 1335 off of Ediz Hook and reported to Mark that they had exited Port Angeles harbor and was heading north for Race Rocks. …" [See CWR Encounter #73 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-73for full summary and photos]

Over the last few days, we've heard reports of a group of
orcas near Port Angeles
, including at least one unidentified individual with an unusual white marking on the dorsal fin. Yesterday Bart Rulon and Justine Buckmaster with Puget Sound Express got out there and got some photos, identifying the unusual group as the
T64Bs, T75Cs, and T77 and T77E
. The T64Bs appear to be first-time documented visitors to the Salish Sea, typically being seen in Southeast Alaska and off central BC (per Towers et al 2019). From the 2019 ID guide, we knew that
seven-year-old T64B1 has a white pigmentation spot on the left side of its dorsal
, but thanks to this awesome snap by Bart, we can see that
its younger sibling, the one-year-old T64B2, has a very similar marking
! This was the "mystery whale" we saw in videos from earlier in the week.
Two descendants of T38 - T38A and T38C - also have white pigmentation marks on the dorsal fin, suggesting that this may be some type of genetic anomaly. It's super cool to have two family groups that have multiple members with this unusual distinguishing feature now! -Thanks so much Bart and Justine for sharing this unique sighting with us! - Bart Rulon

12/28/2020 Quite an exciting adventure on Saratoga today! Early in our trip out of Edmonds we received a report of
orcas in Port Angeles harbor
! By the time we made it there, the group was exiting the harbor and rounding Ediz Hook before turning north toward Victoria. It took us long after the encounter to figure out exactly which orcas were present, they were obviously Bigg's/Transient ecotype but these individuals were mostly new to me! With help from many friends, we were able to ID the
T64Bs (including her one-year-old calf T64B2), the T75Cs, and T77 with her 4-year-old offspring T77E.
What an unusual mix! Where are the rest of the T64s and T77s? How do these individuals know/relate to each other? Are the white spots on the dorsal fins of both T64B1 and T64B2 hereditary? Once again, these amazing creatures are leaving us with more questions than answers! -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

Entry 3:
Haro Strait -

13:20-

13:27 - 1/4 mile south of Edwards Pt./Landbank, the little humpback
was observed making a beeline to the north about 400 - 500 yards out. There was no meandering but there was massive bait ball activity today, both eagles and gulls, so I would imagine the young humpback participated as well. Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday
