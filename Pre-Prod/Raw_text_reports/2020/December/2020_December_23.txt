Watching from Anthony's down by
Point Defiance
, looks like a group of 4. Right now long downtime. (Most we spotted were 4, this time really confusing grouping, long downtime. Husband was helping to look since surfacing was so different than last time I saw them.) -Sil Pri

T37A's
attempting to hunt a sea lion. Lucky for the sea lion he made it out alive. Here are a few pics of
Inky-T37A2
and his newest sibling
T37A5
surfacing together.
*

14:22 -
Really hard to see from my viewing point, (north end of Three Tree Point) but I see about 2 to 3 spouts just north of Vashon appear to be staying in the same spot, a lot of bird activity above the whales.

14:13 -
I just went to the north side of
Three Tree Point
and seeing a few spouts just north of Vashon in front of Blake Island, looks to be about 2-3 whales, too far to see a direction.

13:19 -
Actually I can see the spouts again, they appear to be mid channel off of Point Robinson, maybe closer to the mainland, but looks to be about three whales - can't tell which direction they're going. Too far away.

13:00 -
Up at the top of Three Tree Point, pretty sure I just saw a few orcas spout, appeared to be heading southbound and look to be pretty close to mid channel. Heading down to the beach to see if I can get better visibility. -Shelly Short
