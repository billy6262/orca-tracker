Yesterday [12/4/20] around 1430 we watched a line of maybe a dozen or more Orcas swim into the tide line about 1+ miles south of
Kayak Point
. They were in a line from several hundred yards off of the beach to about a mile out. We saw them swimming at speed and jumping completely out of the water like dolphins, from our home on the bluff at Sunny Shores, on the NW corner of the Tulalip Rez. Eventually they grouped up and we watched them blow in unison as they swam up the bay. 1st time to witness something like that in our 20 years here. WOW! -Dougie Barlow

Greetings friends, 5-6 orcas
moving east towards Everett

0815 - [orcas]
At least 3 or 4 dorsals and blows
north of the new ferry terminal
very close to shore with lots of surface activity. Due to lighting and their backdrop, it's hard to confirm but it looked like they were southbound. Again, I cannot positively confirm their direction. -Durand Dace
