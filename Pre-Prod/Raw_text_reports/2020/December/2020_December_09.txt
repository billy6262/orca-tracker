16.45 -
The orcas changed direction and are languidly making their way north
out of Holmes Harbor
.

16:15 - Orcas are now heading south again toward Freeland Park mid channelish.
----We lucked out again today with a group of transient orcas in Saratoga Passage, heading south
into Holmes Harbor
. It's not often we see whales from home so it's an extra special event when we do. The orcas were super surface active giving whale watchers a wonderful opportunity to witness nature at close range as they passed close to shore at Hidden Beach, their exhalations loud and clear, before continuing deep into Holmes Harbor. After a snack, with gulls and two competing bald eagles enjoying the leftovers, the orcas turned back north languidly disappearing into the fading light as night fell. -Sandra Pollard

What fun to hear that whales were in Penn Cove today! Too late, they'd left, but I did catch up with a glimpse of them at
Long Point
, and close pass-bys at Snakelum, Shangri-La and more distant views from Hidden Beach. The T35s, 38s 137s and 75s were traveling south along Whidbey's shoreline - porpoising at time and generally in a hurry. -Jill Hein

What a sight. Heading south down Saratoga Passage. (Yes, and they returned the next day. The seals were scared to death...they huddled together near the shore. These are clearly transients; they checked out the mussel farm before heading to

Three orcas were sighted at noon, on
December 9 in
Penn Cove
, Washington. They appeared to be feeding and not moving from a position about halfway into the cove, and closer to the northern shore. They seemed to move on around 1230 to the east, exiting the cove. As I am not an expert on orcas, there seemed to be two larger and one smaller orca. -Betsy Lefebvre
