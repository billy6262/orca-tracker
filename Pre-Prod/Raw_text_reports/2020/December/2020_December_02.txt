============================================================

Entry 1:
~

13:00 -
We witnessed a pod of approximately
8-10 Orcas
, close to shore, heading south off Neck Point Park in
Nanaimo, Vancouver Island
today, Dec. 2, at approximately
1:00 pm. I saw one very large orca in the group, as well as a very small one - a baby? Unfortunately, I did not have a camera with me. -J. Ready

Entry 2:
Comox
today and I came across this group. They were super difficult to spot. If you look at the video you can see blows (right against Harwood Island) and then there is the group that was easier to see that was focused on in the video. First I saw
one orca
(mid channel) off Air Force Beach, but I soon lost sight of it. Then, I could see the others near Harwood. After watching the video, I am glad I was able to also capture the blows against Harwood too (that is what caught my eye through my spotting scope). -Patti Perepeluk
