Hood Canal -
"Susan, we went to Hood Canal today just north of south Seabeck, and we're doing a beautiful ceremony on the beach and boom we hear this big breath and we look up and there's a transient pod just a couple hundred yards off from us hunting sea lions. They were very close to shore; it was just beautiful. We feel so lucky." -via Susan Marie Andersson

At noon today at
Point Whitney
beach access I was privileged along with several others to watch
a pod of six orcas
cruise on by the beach for a quarter mile and only fifty yards offshore. They approached from out of
Quilcene Bay
and once past the Whitney Point Shellfish Lab they took a long dive southward to the open stretch of Dabob Bay. They appeared to be of various ages with one large male. I have a video available if requested. What a great day for Hood Canal sightings! -Brad Holm
