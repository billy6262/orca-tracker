Orca Sightings for December 15, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hood Canal - ~

17:00 -
I only had enough light to see them heading past
Scenic Beach
down and back just before 5 tonight.

16:33 - [orcas] Too far for pic but viewing from Scenic Beach. So quiet I heard them first.
---- I saw reports that the orcas might be headed towards the Hood Canal Bridge so I stopped and waited. Was rewarded with seeing them from there but they turned South again. On my way home I stopped in at Scenic Beach. It's beautiful there and was so quiet. I was watching the mist starting to gather and the light fade. I thought I'll just try to snap a pic of the seal I keep hearing. Turns out it wasn't a seal. Was the orcas!!! I could hear them for several minutes before I could find them. The water was like glass. Such and exciting encounter. Just the whales and myself. -Stacey Crofoot
