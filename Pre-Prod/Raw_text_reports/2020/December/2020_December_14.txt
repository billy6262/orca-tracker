Had this sighting at my house in
between Potlatch State Park and Hoodsport
. Happened around 4pm today. There was probably 6 of them. One, I'd assume male is in the back with a very large dorsal fin. He was very close to the house but not able to get a photo of him. They went up more north towards Hoodsport but not quite fully up and then went across the canal towards Bald Point/Tahuya and Union. -Julia Segai
