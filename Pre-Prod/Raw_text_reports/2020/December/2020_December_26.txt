Attached are a couple photos of
orcas that visited the P.A. Harbor
yesterday, Dec. 26th. There were 5 in the group (as far as we could tell). Spotted them about
12:45pm (they were there at least a few minutes before we saw them) and watched for 15-20 minutes, I reckon, until they headed back toward the mouth of the harbor. -Greg Marsh

I was able to see a few heart blows and some swishing/swirling of water around that time (
14:00), but was very far away and no public access down to beach, very remote area. It was def what I needed, warmed my heart right up....Marilyn Armbruster
