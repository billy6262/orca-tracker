Was totally expecting transients when headed to the beach on Sunday afternoon, then boom! Residents! As usual, it was so lovely to see them. They were super spread out in singles and small groups as they came down the east side of the Island. A big SRKW wave stretching from waaay over to the mainland all the way to the Island shores, it was beautiful to see them pour through the channel. Love to see that
Js and Ks
seem to be spending some extended time together too, so great! -Marla Smith

Hiked out to the north end of Double Bluff and southeast end of Mutiny Bay. They were this side of mid channel. Not the best photos tho, but I think T075A Stone is here. -Marilyn Armbruster
