travel.

Whales have passed Sandy Point hugging the shore. Still closely grouped at a steady pace continuing
southbound
.

Large group of
orcas out from Langley Pizzeria
southbound closer to Whidbey.
-----There's nothing like whales to brighten up a dull, grey winter's day... Our pizza slices tasted even better as we watched a regal parade of
tightly grouped Southern Residents
, including (to quote Howard Garrett) the 'esteemed'
Blackberry (J27)
, and newly named
Phoenix (J57)
, Tahlequah's (J35) calf born in September, southbound in front of Langley Pizzeria. Closely hugging the shoreline as they passed Sandy Point under the watchful eye of an eagle, the orcas continued toward the ferry lanes as visibility diminished and dusk fell.

David Haeckel just called. He is at Whale Bell Park,
Langley. SRKWs
are still just north of Langley still heading southbound. On the Whidbey side of mid channel, can see slow moving boat with them with naked eye, but orcas in binos. Seeing at least 10 surface at once! Seeing males in this group.

Good morning folks, just watched a large pod
(7 or 8) of Orcas heading north in the Saratoga Passage
. It's foggy but with good binoculars you can see them….We face west, on the Saratoga Passage. The pod is heading north at a good clip. We are just north of Cama Beach State Park…seven or eight, hard to tell with the thick fog, but a large male breached, magnificent. -Mari Vazquez-Fernandez (Camano Whale Watch, w/permission)
