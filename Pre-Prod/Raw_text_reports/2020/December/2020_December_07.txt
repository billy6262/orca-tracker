Hi, I'm a friend of Scott Veirs. We live in Ballard & just saw a large group of
SRKWs heading southbound off Shilshole
. Our observation lasted maybe 15 mins so and just concluded. Hard to estimate the # of individuals but I would say
at least 20
and likely more. Several large males. We saw maybe 6 breaches and some tail slaps, but the animals were moving fast southbound. They were very spread out, mostly on the E side of the ship channel, but very distributed both N/S and E/W. We were watching from our house w/binoculars so no chance to ID anything. -Michael Dougherty & Catherine DeNardo
