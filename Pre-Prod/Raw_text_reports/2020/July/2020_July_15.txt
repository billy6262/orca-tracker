Big breach from the dark water into the sunlight. They're back, returning from the south. 5-6 breaches, 2 belly flops, inverted tail lob, rolling, aerial scan, spy hops; so many activities I didn't know where to look. Stopping south of Edwards Pt., spreading out, they make their way back to the south and out of sight.

*
Wed,

Entry 4:
South Puget Sound (T46s) -
It appears that the T46s were back in
Henderson Bay
last night. As I was sitting down for dinner, I thought that I saw a male - it was a fair distance out in the bay and coming toward me, so I wasn't positive. I watched for quite a while (5 minutes or so) before I dared to look down to eat but saw nothing, so I started to eat, thinking that maybe I had seen a skier go down. However, as I was finishing dinner, I saw a juvenile in profile, so I finished quickly and went down to go kayaking. When I got down to the beach, there was no sign of the orcas, so I set out toward Purdy. I got nearly there without any sign of them when I came upon some people in a boat who were waiting for them to resurface. I spoke with them for a little bit and continued toward Purdy. A few minutes later, they resurfaced near the west shore of the bay - two males and 2-3 others, now heading south. They took a few breaths and then dove for 10-15 minutes, which seems to be all that they were doing last night. I suspected that they would continue south, so I headed that way and they resurfaced ahead of me, again taking a few breaths and sounding. I continued south but when they resurfaced, they were even further ahead of me - I couldn't keep up. I suspect that it was the T46s, again but never got a good look at them or took any pictures. [
July 16] I woke up around midnight and thought that I heard them in the distance. I laid awake, listening and 10-15 minutes later, heard them again, very close. I got up and went onto the deck. It was quiet enough and they were close enough that I could even hear them inhaling. I was able to barely make out a couple of them, about 40 m from shore. Again, they took a few breaths and sounded. I heard them again in the distance 10-15 minutes later. No more sign of them this morning. I assume that staying down (and probably not vocalizing) is a hunting strategy - correct? Do they ever go under the Purdy Bridge? [
Yes, Ts have - alb
] -Timothy L. Hoffnagle, Ph.D.
*

21:56 - [orcas] Off Horsehead/Kopachuck area
, saw the one with the curved dorsal tip with a notch in it. -Tally Swanson
*

21:41 -
There are 2 groups it seems. This group is still heading north, getting close to
Horsehead Bay
, but on western side. Long dives so hard to keep track. (they were diving for long periods so it was hard to find them.)

21:18 -
They changed direction, heading north now.

21:11 - South toward Fox Island
.

20:58 - [orcas]
Confirming the sighting in
Carr Inlet

*

18:30-

20:30 -
They were back this evening as well in
Henderson Bay
. They were heading in around
6:30pm towards Purdy, and heading out by Cutts Island around
8:30pm.

13:05 - Orcas were just in and now heading out of Henderson Bay
….last I saw they were out by Cutts heading out.

11:09 - [orcas]
We saw them coming in near
Cutts Island
while we were out fishing at
11:09, was when my first photo on my phone was taken, and they went all the way to Purdy and we saw them come back by Cutts around 12:4 ish when we were heading in. (Incase you were concerned by the distance, We were out fishing engines off they popped up pretty close to us. We didn't even know that they were out there.) -Malissa Hutchings
*

10:09 -
Still slowly hanging out barely in sight. Carr, heading west toward
Kopachuck
, close to shore.

10:02 -
Boat left. There are at least 3 smaller fins and a male.

10:00 -
No splashing. But don't seem to be headed anywhere. A boat is there now.

09:49 -

Carr Inlet
. (westbound)

09:45 - Orcas in Hale's Pass
heading toward Fox Island bridge. 3 of them. No boats! Close to Fox Island. Almost to Fox Island bridge. Heading East. -Cari Black
*
~

09:27 -
They are heading into
Hale's Passage
from the north. -Lance Loyd
*

02:30 -
It appears that those orcas remained in
Henderson Bay
last night. I got up at
02:30 to see the comet and heard something outside, so I stepped out on the deck for a while - it was a deer munching on some leaves. While I was there, I heard the orcas blowing. It was way too dark to see anything. They were gone when I woke up (late) this morning. I suspect that they were sleeping (I know that they only sleep with half of their brain at a time) but do they hunt at night? Harbor seals would be on land but harbor porpoises would be vulnerable....but even more difficult to find. -Timothy L. Hoffnagle, Ph.D.
*

01:45 -
Heard Orcas around
1:45 AM 7/15. Wondering which group. I live at
Minter Creek
. It sounded like one big male and 4 to 6 smaller individuals with some splashing like small tail slaps. We have a salmon run going on and there were a large group of harbor seals in the area, so it could be either J or transients. -Gary Furuheim
*

11:42 - 4 orca,
1 male, 2 female & calf near tip of
North Bay
- north of Fox Island. Went under, have not come up again. -Jennifer Summers

GRAY WHALES - Wed,

Entry 6:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

15:30 - Gray 2356(?) heading for Utsalady from Polnell area
. I just happened to glance a puff way out in the channel, and it looks like 2356 is finished with lunch at Polnell and is heading across the bay toward Utsalady. I followed as long as I could with binoculars - I can't confirm that it is 2356 but it would make sense that it is. -Marianne Parry

12:12 - 2356
is feeding in
Polnell Shores
. Striped zebra flipper. White line right side of blowhole. (Some characteristics that we have noticed with 2356: He/she likes to blow bubbles while feeding. Also on the 4-5 breath he'll lift his head way up out of the water. -Terra Parham) ---We had a surprise visitor today as we walked our beach. We believe it is #2356, feeding before it heads north. Be well! Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA
