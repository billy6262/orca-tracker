11:38 -
Taking Rosario south and cutting west toward Cattle Pass, The Salish Sea School came across a tight knit group of
Southern Residents
at roughly
11:38am just
north of Hein Bank
. During our encounter, we witnessed lots of different behavior including thrashing and quick directional changes, porpoising and cartwheels, with down times that averaged 4-6 minutes after seeing this behavior. It's our hope that means they were chasing salmon. Intermittently there were a couple spyhops, tail slapping and pec slapping, and at one point a big cuddle puddle with lots of tactile behavior. Members identified in this group from photos I took were:
J37 & J40 of the J14 matriline, J31 & J56 of the J11 matriline, J19, J41, and J51 (all of the J19's), and J46

In the mix of watching the group of 8 Southern Resident orcas (J Pod),
a minke whale appeared at Hein Bank

making its way north toward Cattle Pass
before I was unable to relocate any longer. -Amanda Marie Colbert, Orca Network

UNCONFIRMED BALEEN WHALES - Fri,

July 10] afternoon around Salmon Beach and Narrows bridge. -Teri Fields Mattsen

UNCONFIRMED SPECIES - Fri,

Entry 8:
Northern Saratoga Passage -
We received a report on the entanglement hotline of a whale at 48°16'41.3"N 122°29'47.3"W
between Browns Point and Mariners Cove
at the south entrance to Skagit Bay. RP was concerned it was not moving far and swimming near some pot buoys. They sent some video, but can only see a blow, no body parts to confirm species. Suspect it is a gray whale. It has now moved on. Through binoculars the RP did not see any gear on the whale or moving through the water with the whale, so suspect it is a normal whale, but wanted to give you a heads up. -Best, Doug Sandilands, SR3
