18:30 - Carr Inlet at all the way into Henderson Bay at the Purdy Bridge.
As we were headed back to the boat launch we noticed people standing on the beach and others in their boats all turned in one direction. It was about 3 min before we figured out what was going on. I was piloting the boat about a knot and trying to take a picture of my family when I Noticed a Dorsal Fin to the Right. 4 of Killer whales were seen slowly moving along, 1 was more playful showing the bottom of its Caudal Fin and swimming with its pectoral fin up from time to time. I can't help but think this one was a youth with its mum, as they were following the other two. We noticed one that seemed to be leading had a curve at the top of its dorsal. Spraying water occasionally from Blowhole. They seemed to be leisurely heading back out of the bay. We observed them for about 45 min. as they reached Allen Point in Henderson Bay. Many people were out watching. It was a busy Monday on the water. A great beautiful sight to see. -Mrs. A'Ro

two orcas in Henderson Bay/Wauna

on the Wauna Peninsula. They were heading out of the Purdy area. I think they were chasing a seal, which I spotted with binoculars a few seconds later. No good pictures as I had to use my phone. -Martin Loyche

It's
8:45 am and I can see the Orca surfacing out by
Glen Cove
. No splashing at this time. No boats out there. It's good to have nice binoculars

08:18 -
Yes, they were here all night and this morning. Lots of splashing, tail slapping. They came past the house toward Purdy slapping their tails as they went. It was interesting since they didn't stop. They went just out of my sight due to trees then turned and came back. I don't see them out anywhere right now.

08:12 -
It's
8:12. I see the posts on FB. I was probably looking thru binoculars at the boats reporting in. My neighbor is out fishing and she just texted to say the last time she saw them they were heading towards
Lakebay
. -Terry Shovlowsky

08:30 -
I saw the
orcas
this morning when I was out in
Henderson bay
heading in towards minter creek on the key peninsula side
6:15am Breaching, tail flapping jumping around until they got about two miles past minter creek then they turned back around and headed back out normally still some tail flapping but not as much we came in at
8:30am and at that time they were in the big water out towards Lakebay. Heading south. -Malissa Hutchings

Just saw an
Orca
come completely out of the water.
Carr Inlet
, first time for this 69-year-old. -Bill DeLeo, Glen Cove
*

06:00 -
I woke up around
06:00 and heard slapping on the water. I looked and saw them moving fast up the bay and doing a lot of tail slapping and cartwheeling. I went down to my kayak and tried to follow them but couldn't 't keep up. My neighbor texted me that he saw them heading south fast along the east side around
7:30. -Tim Hoffnagle
*

07:41 -
They continued S/SW along the Western shoreline of
Henderson
, likely now equal to or past Allen Point (as an Eastern reference) by now...

07:22 -
Latest update: 4 large orcas now back at
Minter Creek
, so that would be moving SW along the Western shoreline of Henderson Bay. Hoping to get pics now that husband will have turned off the motors again.

07:19 -
They are now (as of text 15mins ago) "deeper into Henderson" (assuming near Purdy). Husband and son are fishing this morning and couldn't figure out why the screen went blank... then the orcas started surfacing.

04:59 - Orcas back in Henderson Bay
near Minter Creek as of 15 mins ago. -Dani Nault Kessler

GRAY WHALES - Mon,

Entry 4:
Northern Puget Sound -

02:08 -
So good to have a gray still hanging around! We just watched one (hopefully 2356 but have to check photos) feeding close in here on the southern tip of Mariners' Cove and heading south toward Polnell, but then it disappeared for a few minutes and popped up much further out in the channel looking like it was heading for Utsalady. It now appears to be heading north up the middle of the channel. Enjoy your day! -Marianne Parry
