I suspect some of the whales may have split off again - we only saw a dozen fins at
Lime Kiln

today as those are the ones I don't have confirmation of yet! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

6:45 pm today. Even with a baby doing a full breach! We were quite far away and did not go closer so pictures are poor! -Laney Gale

I am
1 mile south of Pic. Pt. Orcas are north of Eglon
, from my vantage point, slowly moving south toward Eglon. Do not seemed to have turned north into Admiralty but they are at about that area where it's unclear what they will do. From Haines the line of site would probably be Point no Pt.

Viewing from just
south of Picnic Pt

SW bound

a mile south of Possession Point
. They for sure are not hugging Whidbey.

15:59 - S
eeing fins transect Ocean Ave,
Edmonds and Possession Point

I am 1 mile south of
Pic. Pt. Orcas are north of Eglon
, from my vantage point, slowly moving
south toward Eglon

13:10 - Orcas
moving south at speed, mid channel toward Sandy Point.---
July 12, 2020: The more whales there are around the harder it gets to keep up with the photo collection, but here we go for starters... We launched ourselves (on land) just in time to catch the
T65As passing Fox Spit, southbound
, closer to the Whidbey side, and continued to track them as they
approached Sandy Point, Langley
, moving with purpose in wind-whipped waves. Here they paused momentarily, tightly grouped, as though discussing whether to round the point or veer off in a more easterly direction. Decision made, they picked up the pace again and headed toward blustery Brighton Beach and the ferry lanes,
angling toward Mukilteo
. Our final scan was from Glendale, where patience was rewarded by sight of them streaming past mid-channel, once more on a mission. Their 15-mile journey south from Fox Spit to Glendale took 3 hours - no surprise that they were reported as resting south of Possession a bit later. We were ready to go home and do the same! (photos and calculus Richard Snowberger) -Sandra Pollard
*

13:00 - Orcas out middish channel out about north of Langley, southbound.

11:39 - Right off Camano State Park, southbound

UNIDENTIFIED ORCAS - Sun,

Entry 4:
~

18:00
--Watched
a pod of 5 orcas
for about 30 min, starting just after
6:00 pm. --Not sure exactly where they came from, but we first noticed them from the place we rent at the end of Peapod Lane near Sea Acres on the
east side of Orcas Island
--First notice them just to the SW of South Peapod Rock. --They swam behind the rock from our perspective, to the NE, then swung back around and swam along the rock in the opposite direction, to the SW. --We think they were hunting (numerous seals were on the rock) --They stayed in that general location
near S. Peapod
milling around for 10-15 min --Then they swam straight at us, on the move again, coming to within about
100 yards of Orcas Island
in front of the property. --They then turned north, paralleling the coastline; we lost them when they moved far enough north to disappear around the corner, which would have been about the location of Sea Acres. --About 6-8 eagles milling around in the area where they were hunting on S. Peapod. -Brian Home

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun,

Entry 5:
Holmes Harbor
- I just wanted to let you know that I was on a Holmes Harbor night dive last night off our beach at
Beverly Beach
and had
acoustic company by a Humpback whale while at depth for at least 30 minutes
- very loud so reasonably close by - and very frequently almost non-stop calling - amazing! -Florian Graner, PhD, Marine Biologist
*
Sun,

Entry 6:
14:45 - 8-minute down
, 4 surface intervals, sounded, full fluke. Still
southbound

Down 8 minutes
. 4- 5 surface, sounded, fluke again, shallower. Whale still

Up again after 9-minute dive. Surfaced again, few times and sounded, fluke. Same line as
14:13 and still southbound.

14:13 - Just saw the Humpback surface a few times, nice robust exhalations caught my eye finally. Whale is mid channel transect South Richmond Beach/Jefferson Head. Southbound, just now sounded and nice fluke... pretty whale. Viewing from high bluff above Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.

12:50 - Saw several blows then Humpback fluke as they dove. Mid channel in ferry lanes southeast bound. From Richmond Beach. Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

13:24 -
Resighted mid channel out from
Richmond Beach, still heading south
. East side of channel.

13:05 -

trending southeast towards Point Wells
from mid channel/ferry lanes at last dive.

12:03 -
Definitely in shipping lanes, still
southbound past Eglon
.

11:56 - Huge breaches, still heading south now angling towards Edmonds a bit!!

11:26 -

10:54 -
Heading south, past
Useless Bay
, entering mid channel a bit as it exits Admiralty.

9:40 - [HB] Got it heading South in inlet towards Point No Point
on that side of channel. No ID yet. -Janine Harles (
Per Janine "UPDATE: Thank you Leah Vanderwiel!! She ID'd this humpback as
MMX0049 "Shell"
! Yay!"
)
*

07:55 -
Kit Turner called to report seeing a lone whale, thinks
humpback or gray (not an orca) off the north end of Lagoon Point
at
07:55. The whale was traveling slowly and steadily southbound, more on the Marrowstone side of the channel. Whale spouted twice and she hadn't seen it since.
[
confirmed as
humpback
from Janine Harles's photo. -gs

Sun,

Entry 7:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

18:13 -
Update: the whale made a right turn from mid-channel and headed straight toward the usual feeding buffet
between Mariners cove and Polnell Point
. It's just around the corner so out of sight for me at the moment, but I'm hoping it decides to head my way eventually.

17:50 -
There are some big spouts out in the channel, and it looks like whoever it is, is
heading north toward me (Mariners Cove)
but pretty far out. Obv no idea if it's gray 2356, but it would seem like a reasonable guess. Yay - still here! 7/12/20,
5:50pm Thx! -Marianne Parry

Sun,

Entry 8:

On
July 12, I saw
