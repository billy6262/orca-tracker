Orca Sightings for July 9, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (Js) - Offshore of South Beach
we spotted a nice group which included the
J22's and J17's.
They traveled in a tight group northbound. We spotted a few other whales way offshore closer to Vancouver Island and wondered if they were part of J pod or if they were in fact transient orcas. In shore we spotted
J19
hanging out with
J39
. Soon enough they joined the group and made their way up to
False Bay
. At that point they flipped direction and turned south and we decided to stick with them. We kept scanning to the north and spotted some fins coming down island very close to shore. This group included
J31
with youngest J pod member
J56, J41 with son J51
and possibly all the
J14's.
They swam quickly overtaking the group we had been with and continued down to Eagle Pt. Soon enough another group came down island and these orcas were the J16's. The only J pod whale we didn't see today was J27 who was foraging off Eagle Pt. Incredible day
seeing 21 out of 22 J pod members
! After a few breaches the group with the
J22's, J17's, J19 and J39
flipped back north again. We were hoping to sail with them up to Henry Island, but the orcas stopped to forage south of Edwards Pt. Onwards we went up and around the island by way of Henry Island, Jones Island and the Wasp Islands and back to Friday Harbor. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

. Visibly headed south. I see 3-4 right now.

09:45 - [orcas] Unknown number of animals off Eagle Point
. More than a mile offshore in fog bank. I can hear them but can't see them. Based only on sound, I'd say they were trending north. My echo location skills do not compare to J Pod's! -Fred Horn

12:06 - 7 orcas have gone past Eagle Point heading north
. 5 together including the little one. Large male joins them sometimes. Lots of goofy behaviors. Another large male quite far to the north in front of them. He should be to False Bay by now. I could also hear other whale blows further out. The fog cleared enough once to see three other orca.

Cool! Just saw them in the fog. About
4-5 whales headed south to Eagle Point
. They are just about there. One tail slap.

I can hear whale
blows

8:39 Whales' blows have
moved up island towards False Bay

08:38 -
I lost sight of them about 20 minutes ago, not sure if they are in the fog or if I'm just missing them with my binoculars, but am now hearing repeated boat(?) horns blaring from around where they were. (updated: Big ol tanker came out of the fog, that would be the source of the horns!)

08:04 - [orcas] Very far out, SW of Land Bank

06:47 -
A listener using the new Orcasound - Listen for Whales web app "I hear something button" reported orca calls. The detection was a true positive, confirmed as
SRKW call S3
. So perhaps some of J pod was up near Smuggler's Cove and the CWR this earlier morning. -Scott Veirs, Orcasound

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Thu,

North Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet (T36 w/T36Bs) -

50 yards off of Lagoon Pt.

*

16:53 - [orcas] They were in Admiralty Bay
for the longest time over by
Hancock Lake
(just north of Lagoon Point), just off shore. Lost them about half an hour ago. (updated: It looked as if there were about six. They were in no hurry and were not far off shore for a long time. Then we only saw two little ones "playing" for about a half hour. No mature ones were seen and then they disappeared. -Dean Kuest

GRAY WHALES - Thu,

Entry 4:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

16:10 -
Wow, good ol'
2356
is a busy whale lately! He's passing by our place heading south toward Polnell for the second time today! 7/9/2020, 4pm. I saw the white line on its head, so I'm confident it was 2356. Btw - I think I saw two humpbacks? way out in the channel, prob closer to Camano/Utsalady earlier today (7/9 around 1pm). The San Juan Explorer boat was out there going really slowly so I whipped out the binocs to see if maybe 2356 was out there. I've never seen humpbacks before from here, so I'm just going on two brief views through binocs and the photos from the Orca Network sightings email. There were two next to each other, and they had those little dorsal nubbins. I was super excited!! Hope they get along with 2356 ok.

12:14 -
I just spotted
2356
passing our place south of Mariners Cove heading southbound. It's feeding a bit but not lingering long. Have a great day! -Marianne Parry
*

12:35 - Gray is feeding in Polnell Shores. It's 2356
. -Terra Parham

Thu,

Entry 5:
Possession Sound -
One, possibly two grays east of Hat this morning. An islander was crabbing, posted a video, this is a screen grab showing a spot on left side behind dorsal ridge. (update: Just followup on the 2259 sighting yesterday [
July 9], there were two whales traveling together.) -Lori Christopher
[
Yes that is
2020 newbie 2259
with that left side patch. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

MINKE WHALES - Thu,

Entry 6:
Salmon Bank
to look for minke whales. We got lucky
spotting 3 of them
. One of them was our regular that we call "Minke Mouse". Another was distant so we weren't able to obtain the best ID photos. But, it looked familiar to us with its thick, stubby fin. There wasn't much obvious feeding behavior but rather more circling around the bank. After our fun minke encounter we decided to start heading up towards the westside of San Juan Island to see J pod. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
