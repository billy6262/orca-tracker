Just
three days after K-pod
made a brief visit to the Salish Sea we were graced with the presence of
J-pod
. They reached the west side of San Juan Island late this afternoon and streamed north as the sun sank below Vancouver Island. It's been nearly three months since they've been seen in our inland waters and we hope they were finding fish wherever they were. The restoration of Chinook salmon and the habitats they rely on are key to the recovery of these amazing whales. photo -

*
The first orcas we spotted were
J44, J46 and J27 at Eagle Pt.
trending southbound. We continued north on the flood scanning for fins along the way. Drift sailing backwards and sideways from Pile Pt up island we found several groups spread out foraging including
J37 with J49, J35 with J47, and the J19's
. As we neared Lime Kiln
J19
seemed to be hurrying the others along with repeated tail slaps seeming to signal the others to catch up. At that point they consistently moved north and we were able to drift in the strong current parallel. There was more foraging in Mitchell Bay along the way and some orcas foraged within Open Bay. At Kellett Bluff J22 and her son J38 showed up. We left the whales at Battleship as they began porpoising towards Stuart Island. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Sat,

Entry 3:
Haro Strait (T137s)
- A paddle boarder checks out
T137A
as he crosses Victoria's waterfront on
July 4th. -Mark Malleson
*
Sat,

Entry 4:
San Juan Islands -
These guys came
up from Sucia and then around Patos
and then headed out towards Saturna. A good show for the 4th! -Jessica Heidemann
[
"I see the
T137s
and maybe the
T49As
." -Melisa Pinnow
]
*
We headed north this time to the
T137s
who were much closer, providing an alternative to SRKWs who were close, as well. This matriline (family) is not the most high profile, but has shown amazing empathy in regards to the oldest male Jack (18 year old
T137
). This big adrenaline junkie has been known to go after baleen whales on his own, needing rescuing from dear mama. Last year he had a severe injury to his tail stock, and the family slowed down for him and kept him fed. Lions, wolves, hyenas would not have done that. He was very surface active after a hunt on the 4th, and it is quite difficult to see any indication of his injury - orcas heal incredibly well! This was a fantastic predation event followed by family bonding, and that never fails to inspire me. -April Ryan
*
Sat,

Entry 5:
Admiralty Inlet (T37 w/T37Bs, T34s, T36 w/T36Bs)
- Yesterday [
July 4] was a Wowser for sure. An early morning Orca Network alert call and I was off to scan the
west side bluffs of Whidbey from Fort Casey's bluff
. Didn't have to look far, Bigg's whales were about 100 yards off shore, wow, the T34s, and T36s and T37s. What a sight - some of the whales came within FIVE feet of the beach, incredible. They followed the shoreline northbound at least as far as Fort Ebey, with a meal or two in between, and tons of Independence Day visitors had a chance to see them up close. -Jill Hein
*

13:30 - [orcas]
Viewing from
Fort Ebey

They are just passing the C
oupeville ferry terminal/Keystone harbor
. -Bonnie Leavitt
*

10:30 -
Kit Turner called: She is seeing the
orcas north of Lagoon Point
now, still trending northbound. She first saw them at south side of Lagoon Pt. about 30 minutes ago in two groups, 3 in one and 2 in the other. This group was closely followed by another group of 4. Orcas are now currently settled in maybe hunting and/or playing in area North of Lagoon Pt. and south of Keystone ferry dock and appear to be circling around. When they were south, they were leisurely hunting and/or playing, as well.

7/4/2020 Happy Independence Day! Who needs fireworks when you've got a Transient Killer Whale breachfest? We arrived on scene right after the
T36s, T37s, and T34s
made a kill and their celebration afterwards was one to remember. They breached, cartwheeled, and lobtailed their way north
from Port Townsend toward Point Wilson
until we decided to leave them to it and searched elsewhere for more awesome wildlife! -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express
*

10:30 -
These are
T37, the T34s, and the T36s (including the T36Bs)

10:14 -
Now they've turned west toward shore; one individual still spyhopping and tail slapping. Some others appear to be grouped up, resting. Still counting 7-8 fins.

10:09 -
Group was spread about half a mile and continued northwest off of
Lagoon Point
. I'd say they're at least a mile offshore, now. Some spyhopping, tail slapping, and directional changes, though their speed is an average pace. There are at least 10 individuals out here. -Amanda Marie Colbert, Orca Network

July 4, 2020: No holiday lie-in for us on this day of blue skies and sunshine... Hot on the heels of the early morning Orca Call, we arrived to find the whales already north of Bush Point tail-slapping, breaching and milling as they eased toward Lagoon Point. With so many cultural pursuits off limits at present, along with other whale watchers at Lagoon Point we were enthralled to witness a graceful water ballet unfolding before our eyes just a few yards from shore as the orcas
(T34s, T36s including T36Bs, and T37s)
took it in turn to spy-hop, log, dive and, at one point, porpoise. Nobody was prepared for the high-speed race along the shore-line, tip of the dorsal fin skimming below the surface of the water, or the sudden explosion of exhaled air as the orcas rose close...breathtakingly close...to the beach, before continuing on their way past Fort Casey and beyond. Many, many photos yet to go through from this unforgettable encounter. (photos Richard Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard
*

09:12 -
Camille Hartley called again, orcas have moved
north towards Lagoon Point
and are breaching! Tide is very low.
*

09:00 -
This pod passed by
Lagoon Point
at 0900 this morning. It looked like 7 in the group all together. A group of 5 that I took for females and juveniles were in the lead and just when I thought it was over two more came along that looked like males. -Bob VonDrachek

08:55 -
Camille Hartley called. She is at
Bush Point
and has orcas in front of her. She lives up on the hill and sees at least 3 just to north of the point. Seem to have stalled a bit and are circling around and diving. Have not seen any breaches. She could hear them breathing!
*

08:43 -
Pat Scott called:
4-5 orcas just passed by Bush Point
close to shore (some at 50 feet) and now are on long dive, heading further offshore on their way to Lagoon Point.
*

08:15 -
Amazing morning,
at least six orcas south of Bush Point
,
8:15. Looks like at least two males and one smaller. Much splashing, diving, spyhops, very close to shore. -Kate Sheppard
*

08:00 - Orcas in Admiralty Inlet
, 2 miles south of
Bush Point
, heading north, very close to Whidbey. -Mike Meyer

GRAY WHALES - Sat,

Entry 6:
Possession Sound -

20:48 - 1 gray whale
seen traveling west, one mile east of Hat/Gedney Island. Traveling fairly quickly! Saw 5 blows and a fluke dive. Unfortunately too far away for a good picture with just a phone. Saw a second gray whale minutes later, feeding in the shallows off the edge of the drop-off. Same location. -Jennifer Huntley
