Entry 3:
5 orcas
pass by at
8:40pm. They swam
north towards the Hood Canal Bridge
. We are about 3 miles south of the Hood Canal Bridge. We saw four dorsal fins in the air at one time. When they went down, another one came up from behind. We watched them for 30 minutes as they made their way towards the bridge. I've attached a couple of grainy long distance pictures showing three of them. -Mark Beyer, Port
*

19:40 -
We just saw a pod of orcas off
Hazel Point on Hood Canal! Headed north
. We think they were hunting just south of Hazel Point. Then they swam north toward the naval base and stopped again circling something about half way between the point and the south edge of the base. It was pretty amazing. We are staying at a friend's place and it was our first time ever seeing orcas. Getting to watch and listen to them was quite the experience.

17:25-~

17:50 -
It appeared to be a group of 6 or 7 of various sizes. They looked to be hunting just south of Hazel Point and then headed north toward the navy base. -Eric Dalquist
