Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage - ~

19:30
- Wow, this is getting to be a daily event (4th happy hour in a row!), although
Gray 2356
was an hour or two late today - lol. It showed up around
7:30pm (7/28/2020), heading southbound past
Mariners' Cove
, and was moving along at a pretty good clip. It finally slowed down a little and began feeding as it approached the shallow bay I mentioned yesterday, just north of the rocks. I watched for about 20 minutes as it was feeding and slowly moving southward and around the bend toward Polnell. -Marianne Parry

10:15 - Gray whale is back feeding [Polnell Shores].
-Terra Parham

Entry 4:
San Juan Islands (T65As & T137s)
- The orcas were milling at the bottom of
East Sound
not really going in any particular direction. There were many private boats and few commercial boats on scene all of which shut down and well behaved enjoying the view and the sounds as the orcas surfaced. The Ferry responded to our call on the VHF and came to a complete stop to ensure they were clear of the orcas before proceeding. After some decision making the orcas began traveling westerly in the channel together as a group. We hugged the
top of Lopez Island
watching the orcas in the distance as they traveled mid channel towards Flat Pt. We decided to break off for some fun sailing across the channel over to the rocks south of Turn Island to see the harbor seals hauled out. The orcas followed behind and crossed the channel as well and made their way deep into
Griffin Bay
close to San Juan Island traveling down the channel.
T137A and T65A2 - T65A and T137
