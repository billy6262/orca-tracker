Orca Sightings for July 25, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
14:25-

18:45 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #35: "… There was a large gap between the
L83s
and the next whale. We eventually found a whale
off South Beach plunging east toward Salmon Bank
. By the time we caught up to the single female, we were on the north part of Salmon Bank. The whale turned out to be
L90
, one of the whales we could not find the day before. L90 was moving quickly east and was not surfacing regularly so it made it hard to get good shots of her. Her appearance was rather stiff and rigid so there is a chance she may be pregnant again. …" See CWR Encounter #35 for full encounter summary and more photos. https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-35

We were so pleasantly surprised when the sub-group of
Ks and Ls
was picked up this afternoon at
Hein Bank
, thinking they may have left! They made their way back towards San Juan Island, and interestingly the majority of the group went north through
Cattle Pass
, which is very unusual for them to do. We were at the Cattle Point Lighthouse to see them head back south out the pass, where I snapped this shot of L55 Nugget and L123 Lazuli. It's been really great to see these whales, some of whom we haven't seen in 10 months! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*
19 L pod whales and 3 K pod whales
plus a couple
minke whales
! Surprisingly the
Resident orcas went up San Juan Channel through Cattle Pass
at 10 knots on the flood - they stopped abeam of Upright Channel and flipped back south eventually exiting Cattle Pass against the current! -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

I'm hearing that they're down by the boat launch now (
west of Belfair State Park

15:18 -
Just left NE Landon Rd in
Belfair
. They are mid canal headed
towards Twanoh State Park
. At least one male, one baby (maybe two) and I think a female. We were on the shore. A number of boats shadowing every move. Thank you Orca Network. I have lived here for six years and finally got to see them. -Cindy Cotter

They turned around just before
Belfair State Park

On the Northshore, heading toward
Belfair State Park
. Almost to Landon road. -Marci Johnson

14:45 -
We saw I think 7. One or two big males. One little one. And they were toward
Belfair
- between Forest Beach and Sunset Beach. Super active! So fun to watch. This was at
2:45. Was in a kayak and they came super close to a boat right next to us, tail slapping, and breaching. -Emily Marie
*

13:18 - [orcas]
Got to see them! They are still heading [east] towards
Belfair

Twanoh State Park
on Saturday. -Kelly Hoonan

12:40-

13:15 - [orcas]
We were watching them between
12:40 and
1:15 from a spot on the road about half a mile west of
Twanoh State Park
. They were somewhat active and tail-lobbing frequently and were probably on a kill. The orcas were heading northeast towards Belfair. Super cool to see a WDFW police boat keeping boats responsible! -Connor O'Brien
*

12:30 - Five orcas seen in Hood Canal in Belfair
. They were first reported to me 1 mile east of Tahuya at
12:30 pm, which is 5 miles from my house. Swam to point near … boat ramp (5 mile marker NE North Shore Road), then headed back west. Seemed to be one large whale, one intermediate and three smaller individuals. Lot of tail slapping, some breaching. -Peter Roberts

, WA. One adult male, one small adult female, a juvenile and a calf. -Allison Youngberg

Slowly moving towards

They stopped to kill and eat a seal, short of

Steady moving south towards

Looking at them from
Potlatch State Park

Sat,

Entry 3:
14:54 -
Letting you guys know that we're watching
what looks to be a single male orca
get harassed by two jetskis. Watching southwest off of the Chambers Bay skybridge. It's too far out to get a picture.
Between Chambers Bay and Hyde Point. It's heading south
, towards Steilacoom. It had probably a 4-foot dorsal. I'm positive it wasn't a dolphin. -Johnny Collard

I've been away for a few days, but good ol'
2356

Sat,

Entry 6:
Possession Sound -

11:44 -
So many spyhops by
2262 and 2356
! I've lost count!! Both at
SE Hat Island
."---After dropping our crab pots today, we headed over to Hat Island near Everett where we found 2 gray whales (#2262 and #2356 I think). They were travelling together and they spyhopped like crazy! Then after some human shenanigans with some idiots in a pontoon boat, the boat left and the whales continued on towards Everett where they breached about 5 times! My breach shots are soft as we were quite a ways a way. Fyi, I've only seen a gray breach once and that was last year and got no photos. They do breach, but it is rare around here!! These 2 whales are definitely pals! -Janine Harles
*
~

10:00 -
We saw something
between Hat Island and Port of Everett Marina
close to shore around 10am. Pretty sure I saw a dorsal fin and thought it was an orca, but could it have been one of the grays? Lots of spouting, rolling, and tail slapping- incredibly beautiful! Thanks in advance for your input! (updated: Upon further reflection, and reading of recent Grays feeding by the delta, we're pretty sure it was
a Gray
and not an orca. The fin popped up intermittently and wasn't "constant" like how an orca swims.) -Janya Veranth
