Looks like a round [dorsal] tip to me! They entered
Active Pass
and exited the pass and possibly went up Trincomali Channel.

I have eyes on
orcas northbound in Swanson Channel
. Behaviour seems like Jpod. -Rachelle Hayden
*

05:30 -
Sightings from the shore of
Galiano Island
this morning. Eight members of
J pod
came into Georgeson Bay around
5:30 am. After some activity there, they exited the Bay and, instead of coming through Active Pass, went north up Trincomali Channel. We followed up the island and had sightings of them from Lover's Leap, Spotlight Cove, and the North End government dock. They swam steadily and speedily. (Thanks to Rachelle Hayden and Gary Sutton for the ID help.) -Cheers, Karoline Cullen

07:45 -
I didn't get a chance to let you know this morning, but it looks like the same two I saw pass by on Tues evening going northbound came back by us early this morning heading south! It was around
7:45am and there was heavy fog, but I managed to spot a fin through the mist and captured a couple of shots before they went past! Looks like a lone boat was slowly following them which was fun to see in the fog! -Jennifer Swenson
*

07:45 -
Saw
four orcas cruising south out of Henderson Bay
between Minter Creek and Raft Island at
7:45 am
July 16, 2020. They were moving quickly and not fooling around. No boats were shadowing them like two days ago when a pod swam by the same area. Guess it was too early for humans to be out on a Friday morning. It appeared to be a large male and three smaller dorsal fins. -Kevin Stroh
