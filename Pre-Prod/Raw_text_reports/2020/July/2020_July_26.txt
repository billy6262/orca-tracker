Orca Sightings for July 26, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
orcas
. They turned out to be the
Southern Resident Killer Whales with members from K and L pod present
. They were very spread out looking like they were traveling west and feeding along the way
near the Elwha River
. They seemed to be everywhere we looked as we turned and traveled along with them. We had some really great looks as some of the large males made sure to surface near us before disappearing below the waves. The big males were impressive and we saw a few females and juveniles with some tail slapping and some distant breaching going on. -Lee, Island Adventures

Hood Canal -

14:30 -
We just returned home after encountering four in
Dabob outside of Jackson Cove
. I'd say it was
2:30. They were very playful. They swam up to at least three stopped boats and checked out the humans on board. They swam beside our boat and tilted to the side to look at us. Amazing! Boaters were very respectful. Headed north mid channel. -Robin Lang Schnuit

GRAY WHALES - Sun,

Entry 4:
18:16 - 2356
came back southward close to shore right past
Mariners' Cove
close to shore, feeding as it went by and waving its fins and shaking its tail - lol. He is still out here headed slowly toward Polnell.

17:00 - Another update: 5pm 7/262020, Just spotted some puffs (sorry, "spouts" north of
Mariners Cove
and way out in the channel. Looks like it passed by Utsalady and is either headed across back here or possibly heading north of here.

15:50 -
Quick update: I see it again now. It showed up a little too early for the usual buffet because the tide is pretty low still, so now it appears to be heading north across the channel toward Utsalady maybe.

15:39 -
Just got a tip from a neighbor and spotted a gray just south of me, which appears to be heading to Polnell. The neighbor said it was mid channel but by the time I spotted it, it was much closer to shore. Still far enough south that I didn't get a good look though, so can't ID. It's pretty low tide. -Marianne Parry

01:00 -
My next-door neighbor txtd my hubs this morning that a
gray went by at 1am
, but obv can't ID. I haven't seen anyone except 2356 from my location in weeks, prob since Patch left. That line on its head is so easy to ID it by. Have a great day! -Marianne Parry
