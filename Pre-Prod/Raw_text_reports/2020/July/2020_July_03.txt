, including one large male and a little kid, the
T65As
were far out traveling to the north between the northern edge of
Hannah Hts. and Edwards Point

T65A2's
fin. The littlest orca was bouncing alongside an elder sibling, seeming to leap along. Very sweet. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

17:45 - [orcas] Near Possession

11:30-

12:00 -
We watched a small pod of orca off
Marrowstone Island
on Friday,
July 3rd, from about
11:30 to noon. They were about 1/2 mile to 1 mile off the western side of Admiralty Inlet about midway up the island. Not an expert, but looks like there were 2 or 3 females, 1 calf, and a male in the pod. They weren't staying completely together so it was tough to get a number. We saw two breaches, one spy hop, and two pectoral fin waves. Attached are my pictures, which aren't very good. I was shaking with excitement and my 300mm lens amplified that. I cropped the images to see the whales better. Cheers! -Rick Corlett

07:06 -
My sighting was from a bluff at
Fort Worden
. A pod of at least 3 orcas were surfacing far off, passing in front of the lighthouse at
Fort Casey, heading north

in same place doing same thing as
08:52 WSF report! Currently just
south of the Clinton dock

--- Took off this morning looking for a group of transients that were seen off of Edmonds, HOURS later we finally found the
T36's near Clinton
. We watched them kill two seals near Gedney Island! Eventually we lost them so we headed home and then found another group of transients… ("The T36 family had a fascination with the crab pots and buoys and took many of them...not sure where some of them ended up...") -Janine Harles
