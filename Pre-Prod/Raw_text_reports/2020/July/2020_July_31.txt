Fri,
July 31, -
Northern Saratoga Passage -

22:57 -
There is a
gray
(presumably) whale spouting outside my place right now (7/31/20,
10:45pm) - likely 2356 but can't see in the dark to verify. It sounds like it is feeding based on the very slow progress of the spouting sounds down the beach. Sounds like it's
heading south toward Polnell
. Isn't it just magical to sit outside on a warm summer night and hear whale puffs in the dark?! Awesome. PS - There were two big whale watching boats just out from the northern tip of Utsalady around noon today, watching what appeared to be a gray (in binocs) for quite a long time - maybe up to an hour? It cruised south just a little and then I lost sight of it after the boats left. I'm assuming they send you info as well (hopefully).

I missed this one, but my neighbor says he saw spouting mid-channel around 11am 7/31/20. Hopefully you'll get other reports from the area to corroborate! Enjoy your day! -Marianne Parry
