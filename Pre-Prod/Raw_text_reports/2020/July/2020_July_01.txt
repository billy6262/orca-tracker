It was a special day today as we welcomed back part of
K-pod to the San Juan Islands
. This is the first time we've seen them in 2020 and their familiar fins were certainly a welcome sight.

8-10 members of K Pod
traveled south (down island) between
Edwards Point
and the northern edge of Hannah Hts. They came around Edwards Point in an orderly line and then suddenly began breaching with many lobtailing. This behavior continued for just a few minutes, then they regrouped and continued on to the south.
K22 Sekiu, K33 Tika, K43 Saturna, K34 Cali, K38 Comet, K37 Rainshadow
were among the group. It's so beautiful. Sometimes, it almost doesn't seem real. -Michelline Halliday

Lots of excitement as soon as we woke this morning with news that
K pod had arrived to San Juan Island
. We'd been expecting them after hearing they were Southbound from Hanson Island at noon on
June 29th - 205 Nautical miles away. They passed Lime Kiln at
9:15am - 45 hours later. So they averaged 4.5 knots (5.2 mph) at continuous travel. And good news is that they were foraging at False Bay. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
