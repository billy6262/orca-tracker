Hello, I wanted to report a whale sighting, could be possible minke or small humpback. We saw the whale today, Tuesday Oct 20 at
11:50 in Seabeck, Washington. It was traveling up towards the Hood Canal Bridge. It was traveling close to the shore by the Olympics and Dabob Bay. It seemed to just be traveling back up north as it was going at a steady pace. We lost sighting of it at
12:00 when we saw its tail as it dove back down. -Savannah Johnson
