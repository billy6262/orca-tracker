The 3 or 4 of them we saw from

17:25 - J pod is NW of Edmonds
, slowly traveling NW, in no hurry, generally towards Scatchet Head, S Whidbey - sightline from Edmonds (~47.870814, -122.429910). Too soon to say if committed to Admiralty, as they are still east side of channel. At this time, they are showing no sign of heading towards Possession Sound.

17:00 - J pod loosely grouped out from Edmonds Dive Park
north of ferry lanes now (~47.823119, -122.421665), slowly northbound on Edmonds side and keeping to it. Water smooth and calm, lighting still silvery bright. Gorgeous pass at Marina Park and now here, as well, from Sunset Ave., north of the ferry dock/Brackett's Landing.

16:25 -

16:50 -
I arrived at
Edmonds Marina
Beach just as lead group (including 2 males) was due west still heading northbound (appears to be the earlier trailing group when off Kayu Kayu). This now lead group loosely grouped, with larger resting line group trailing (~47.798974, -122.420973). Js continued steady northbound on the east side of the channel keeping to the Edmonds side, but angling slightly NW. They are in no hurry. So wonderful to run into friends Monika and Jason of Orca Behavior Institute.

16:03 - J pod
has grouped up, most members are now in beautiful resting line out from
Kayu Kayu Ac Park in Shoreline
, slowly northbound east of mid channel (~47.772561, -122.418307) with several trailing, including at least two bulls, this group is loosely spread making directional changes. Looks like lazy foraging while heading northbound. Sublime. From Kayu Kayu Ac Park, Shoreline.

15:30 - J pod
traveling slowly northbound mid channel (~47.743480, -122.425597), and spread out on either side of,
between Richmond Beach and Point Jefferson
, Kitsap. Lighting is very cool and water lit up bright right now and is calm making viewing of, especially the males, much easier through binoculars. So lovely. From Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.

14:00 - J pod
is mid channel and west. Who I think are leaders are still just south of
Fay Bainbridge Park
(~47.696035, -122.478438) with others trailing. Research boat is back with mid/trailing group. Hard to see from mainland side, orcas are visible, but mostly blows, occasional fins, and breaches with binoculars. Conditions today are not in favor with naked eye from this side, not even so brilliant with binocs. All steady northbound. From Shilshole/Golden Gardens.

13:24 -
I am seeing orcas spread from just east of mid channel (~47.684650, -122.444701) to across well west of mid channel, steady northbound out from south end
Shilshole Marina
. Bull with several others is mid to just east of mid channel. From Shilshole/Golden Gardens.

13:15 - J pod
: Someone was breaching in tankers wake out from north end of
Rolling Bay, Bainbridge
(~47.679619, -122.475869) in southbound shipping lanes while heading northbound, along with several other orcas who were surfacing near the research boat. From Sunset Park, Ballard. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
