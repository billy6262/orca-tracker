UNIDENTIFIED BALEEN WHALES - Thu, Oct 15 - Central Puget Sound - Saw a whale matching that description [Julie Schlenger's report below] at
Discovery Park
in Seattle
around sunset
. It came up about 50 yards from the north beach and then headed SW toward Bainbridge from there. -Tyler Kretchmer

11:55 -
Julie Schlenger called to report observing
a baleen whale (leans humpback)
at around
11:55am. She was at
Howarth Park, Everett
, where she first spotted the blow and then watched the whale heading SW towards Mukilteo. She watched several intervals of the whale surfacing. The whale presented fluke each time it sounded. The whale had a lot of white on its fluke underside. Looked smaller than most humpbacks she has seen. (She has viewed humpbacks often at Stellwegen Bank.) [I explained Port Susan humpback was a juvenile and she thought that likely was about the right size. -alb].

07:50 -
Gray whale in front of Tulare Beach headed south, in close, at the boat buoy line. Sorry no photo. I am not certain at all [if
gray vs. humpback
]. It very easily
could have been a humpback
. This morning it was just under the surface swimming south. -Rose Rubatino Goulet, Camano

Entry 3:
10:24 -
Second hand report of
a gray whale off Point No Point
early this morning (~
7:30am). Unfortunately, I do not have any additional details to exclude
possibility of it being a humpback
. -Michelle Savoie

18:00 -
A whale that appeared to me to be an orca was
moving south along Golden Gardens
beach at Shilshole Bay. It spouted and breached several times. Numerous others were there and saw the whale. It was just before sunset around 6pm or a little earlier during high tide. Tide was very very high last night. -Beth Dodrill
