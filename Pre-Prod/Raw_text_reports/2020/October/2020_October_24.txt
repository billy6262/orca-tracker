Entry 2:
18:00 - Gray 2261
seems to have rediscovered this part of the shoreline and was back again this evening right before sunset (6pm). It popped up right in front of us, so we felt lucky to be in the right place at the right time! It was feeding close to shore at
Mariners Cove
, heading toward the mudflats and presumably on toward Polnell. I can confirm that it was 2261 - both the white line by the blowhole as well as the pec fin. (Later added: I've been here for the past 22 summers, and 2018 is the only other year that we had a gray hanging out near our place all summer, but I didn't take copious notes about the exact dates. The last photo I had was from 9/28/18.) -Marianne Parry
