Orca Sightings for October 6, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (J pod) -

22:44 -
A listener reported
J pod calls
at
22:44 that night (10/6/2020) on the
Orcasound Lab hydrophone
(5 km north of Lime Kiln). They were really faint and echoing wonderfully off the underwater canyon walls of Haro Strait, but definitely SRKW calls! -Scott Veirs, Orcasound

22:22 - [J pod] Starting to hear calls on Lime Kiln
. -Linda Aitkins
*

22:07-

22:58 - Lime Kiln hydrophone
. Soft calls and clicks intensified into a concert of varying calls and sounds; clicks, calls, squeaks, raspberries and horn blowing. 50 minutes and then abruptly it was quiet.

21:38-

22:15 -
In the dark under the stars I listened as
J-pod
passed so slowly northbound just south of Edwards Point. Beautiful, continuous exhalations. They must have been very spread out because the first calls and clicks were heard on the Lime Kiln hydrophone before the trailing members had passed by my location. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

- distant look from Ebey's Landing…---Surprisingly decent breach picture from Bush Point Lighthouse (my first foray to that spot) with Marilyn Armbruster and Sandy Pollard. Marilyn and I then went to the south end of
Lagoon Point
, but the fog was too thick. Then to Ft. Casey....again, thick fog. Stopped by Ebey's Landing (high bluff) and saw two whale watch boats and distant whales, heading north. Went up to Ft. Ebey but they must off gone back into the fog. Assuming J pod as that was the reporting, so great to see even a few of them! -Bonnie Gretz
