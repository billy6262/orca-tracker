Group of
at least 3 Js
, including male and little one, still foraging in
Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes
. East side of mid channel NW of Point Wells.

18:00-

18:30 -
Watched
Js
for past 30 minutes+ continue northward movement as they foraged, spread from
Pt. Wells
to mid channel. At
18:30 several (female/young) were still foraging in ferry lanes, more east side channel (Added: 47.794089, -122.428448). I believe
most have trended north
. Not seeing any whales at this time from north Richmond Beach (just south of Pt. Wells). So sweet to watch a little one forage. Night Night J pod.

17:55 -
Several have
stalled to forage offPt. Wells
including male, female, young. Male lunging.

17:50 -
So many
Js
fairly close in to
Richmond Beach
. Babies! Now spread
northbound now from Point Wells
to east of mid channel, some look to be in family groups. Others moved offshore as they passed Kayu Kayu Ac Park, Richmond Beach, observing foraging with others moving
steady NB
. Breaches, pec slaps, little ones porpoising while steady northbound. Mountains, blue sky, illuminated J pod exhalations... sublime. From Kayu Kayu Ac park. (Added notes/gps: closest group, females w/calves, passed Kayu Kayu - 47.774455, -122.398794)

17:20 -
From roadside north of
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
, I can see
J pod
spread across from close to this side (maybe 1/2 mile) out to east of mid channel. Coming north.... and foraging along the way. (Added notes/gps: Several of the whales came inside Data buoy anchored off Richmond Beach: Station 46120 - Pt. Wells, WA (U of Wash) 47.761 N 122.397 W (47°45'40" N 122°23'50" W) putting them less than .5 miles offshore, with others spread to one mile offshore.)

17:05 -
Quick glimpse from side of road, at least some
Js
kept close to mainland side and are
north of Carkeek
(added: 47.723702, -122.388543). Still
northbound
, quick pace. From just Broadview neighborhood just north of Carkeek.

16:40 -
Several members of
J pod
kept to east side, cutting in eastward decently close when they moved past Meadow Point, north end
Golden Gardens
(added: 47.701587, -122.410950). Other members steady NB spread out between that group to East of mid channel (added: 47.706154, -122.431641).

16:16 -
Beautiful
J pod
now committed and moving fast northbound off the north end
Shilshole Marina to Golden Gardens
. Js are not as spread out, have grouped together in groups of 3-5s. East side of channel. Some diversionary movements chasing fish (presume), but all on the move. I met a baby or two.

15:55 - Southbound movement has ceased.
Spread out J pod orcas continue to forage out
from Shilshole Marina
with northbound trend and many directional changes. Two bulls east side of channel currently northbound, but have been making directional changes as well. Smaller groups still spread wide.

15:25 - J pod
still out from
Shilshole Marina
spread out the entire stretch of the marina. In general all members are foraging making
many directional changes
. I see at least 8 groups of 1-3 (or 4) spread out mostly mid channel with some East of. Approx. one-mile distance separates the most southerly group and most northerly which is also the most eastern group (added: 47.688914, -122.434951).

15:10 -
At least 2 leaders are
southbound
east of mid channel, big cartwheel! Others trailing behind in several groups of 1-4 spread apart by many hundreds of yards, still
foraging out from Shilshole Marina
some stalled out while others making directional changes trending southbound.

15:00 -
Lead group of
Js
has stalled and is foraging basically in same place. Making directional changes. I see at least 1/2 dozen spread individuals mid channel and east of.

14:45 -
Seeing at least
2 J pod
females out from
Shilshole Marina
(north end) East of mid channel. Steady southbound. Haze, mild chop, and spread out whales makes seeing them a little challenging. From Shilshole Marina/Golden Gardens.

12:40 -
Who I believe are leaders (led by female) are
south of Jefferson Head
and out from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park traveling steady southbound with others trailing seen at least 1/2 mile north. And, at least those I'm seeing have moved over towards mid channel but are still slightly west of (added: 47.741068, -122.433950). Richmond Beach still good viewing, and Carkeek on mainland side would be next best public viewing location. They are distant, binoculars needed.

12:05 -
Some
J pod members still foraging in ferry lanes
. WSF has been notified whales still present.

11:56 -
I am seeing fins spread S to N from out from P
residents Point
, Kingston (47.768066, -122.456942) to out from north of Kingston ferry dock (sightline) (47.795696, -122.467333) in 1-3s spread wide in southbound shipping lanes to more Kitsap side slow southbound. Still some directional changes,
foraging
. Still viewing from Kayu Kayu Ac Park, Shoreline.

11:40 - J pod.
Who looks to be lead/most southerly group (at least 8+) is
south of Apple Tree Point pointed southbound
, with some making directional changes.

11:30 -
I just arrived to
Kayu Kayu Ac park in Shoreline
, quick scan and pretty quickly caught a breach! Sightline transect my location to S side Apple Tree Point, Kingston about in the southbound traffic lanes. (added: 47.801022, -122.454490). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Saw them from the
Kingston -> Edmonds ferry
around
11:15! -Casey Hilgenbrink

11:48 - J pod
is still
southbound off Kingston
spread out. It appears to be all of J-pod.

11:10 -
They are still very spread out, mostly on the Kitsap Peninsula side, still southbound and foraging...---Meet J-pod's newest member,
J58
! Yesterday we found J-pod just 10 minutes into our trip from Edmonds, and one of the first orcas we saw was
J58, with mom, J41, grandma, J19, and brother, J51!
Mom, J41, Eclipse, made history when she had her first calf, J51, Nova, at the young age of almost 10 years old back in 2015. That's the youngest mom we've ever seen with the resident orcas. Her new calf, J58, was just born on
September 24, 2020 and we don't know yet if its a boy or girl. That is the second calf born into J-pod in less than a month, and its exciting news for the resident killer whales!
Yesterday the rest of J-pod was spread out and foraging while we mostly sat motionless in the water watching them in all directions. They were very playful, and we must have seen 20+ breaches. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express
