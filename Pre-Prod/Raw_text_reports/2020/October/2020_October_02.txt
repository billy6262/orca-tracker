Orca Sightings for October 2, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T123s) -

19:40-

20:05 - Hearing 4 or more orcas
near the shore moving very slowly to the northwest. There was a band of light remaining on the water and I saw a large male but no one else. With long exhalations the group surfaced often as they moved out and away from the island N/NW. The exhalations were so frequent that it could have been more than 4. I did hear 4 in quick succession at one time. (Orca Sighting, 1/4 mile
south of Edwards Point
, SJI. Heavy tanker noise made this activity difficult to assess.) -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 2:
Gray (2261?) is racing northward up Saratoga Passage
. From my vantage point at Mariners Cove, it has come all the way up from the point south of Maple Grove Beach and has already passed
Utsalady Point
in the span of 10 minutes. It usually cruises at a much more leisurely pace. -Marianne Parry

Entry 3:
16:45 - Grays in the Snohomish delta
. I see them every day from my place in the evening about 5pm. -Jaime McBroom
