----Yesterday (Oct 10) we saw the T35As, T38As, and two members of the T137 matriline harassing a Steller sea lion off the Cattle Point lighthouse on San Juan Island. Cool enough in its own right, but made even more impressive by the 5' seas they were leaping through as they did it. Photos didn't do it justice, so here's a short video of the encounter. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute - video - https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=374134570635982

Just as we got underway a whale sighting was relayed about
a pod of orcas coming down Upright Channel
in our direction. The orcas were later identified as the
T35A's, T38A's accompanied by T137B and T137D
. At first winds seemed surprisingly light as we sailed towards
Turn Island and across San Juan Channel
.
The orcas were moving quickly and we were able to see their blows as they got closer traveling in a tight group. We had a nice pass viewing the orcas as they went by, but we had a hard time keeping up under sail since they were moving so fast. When we spun around, the winds were coming up the channel from the southwest and the seas were a little sloppy as we were pointing into it. Spray was coming over the bow and folks were getting salty. The orcas were heading towards Griffin Bay and further into the slop so we opted to get a couple distant looks before spinning around to head north for an easier, more relaxing family sail. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing - photo - "T35A's, T38A's with T137B and T137D"

2 humpbacks again today a nautical mile south of Point Jefferson

UNIDENTIFIED BALEEN WHALES - Sat, Oct 10 - Hood Canal - We were driving westbound across the bridge around
1300
, I saw the blow from about a half mile away at around mid-span around 100 yards north of the bridge, so it was definitely big based on the blow. As we drove by mid span saw finning but no tail, definitely bigger than porpoise or an orca. We were driving so didn't get a good look, but color looked light grey, white and or brownish which seemed like an odd color. Didn't see direction of travel. -Chris Endres

My son said he saw
a whale from the Hood Canal bridge
. It was not a humpback or an orca. He said it had a
light colored back
and was spouting. We are trying to figure out what other whale it could be. He said it was definitely not one of the porpoise species as it was too big. -JJ
