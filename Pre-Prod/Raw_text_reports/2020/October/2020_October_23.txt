Hi again, they are 100% still here.
5:15pm Oct. 23. They are all spread out and hanging around. They are
between Cortez Island and Campbell River
, but closer to Cortez. Witnessed fast moving by some and others with a breach or two and feeding. We are trying hard for better photos. So pleased to provide this information to you. -Patti and Mark Perepeluk

I'm having the best morning thanks to
Gray 2261
, who came by for an extended breakfast and is feeding its way slowly past my house heading south toward the happy meal mudflats. It picked a stormy day for a visit, so I snuck outside with my iPhone instead of the good camera, but these photos should be enough to ID and see how close to shore it is. It's been in front of my place for a good 20 minutes now. Who needs coffee when you've got a gray to rev you up in the morning - lol! -Marianne Parry
