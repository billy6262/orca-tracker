Entry 2:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

15:00 -
I just spotted a whale-watching boat quite far out from the
northern tip of Camano in Skagit Bay
, and there is indeed
a gray feeding
out there. Hard to imagine it could be anyone except 2261, but if so, it snuck back up along the Camano side while I was emailing you the last report. It appears to be creeping toward Utsalady.
~

12:45 -
I tried to keep an eye on this morning's gray and as luck would have it, it decided to come
across toward Whidbey and head south directly toward Mariners' Cove
prob around
12:45ish. I can confirm that it was 2261 based on the line by the blowhole. It cruised past our place (southern tip of Mariners' Cove) a little bit further out than usual, but the tide was only at 0.5', so that's apparently where the food was. Feeding lightly as it went along, it arrived down at the happy meal mudflats and spent quite a bit of time feeding heavily (circling/waving/etc.) and letting out enormous "burps" now and then (way bigger than the usual ones! Ballast?). It ate for a while on the north side of the protruding rocks and then slowly worked its way around them to the Polnell side, still feeding and waving flukes/fins. From a distance, it looked like it finally had enough and decided to move on directly southward.

12:00
- Just an update on the whereabouts of presumably 2261 - it is spouting off the
northern tip of Utsalady
and appears to be heading toward Whidbey. It came by around this time yesterday so I'm hoping it makes a turn to the south and visits me shortly for a snack. Update: Gray never showed up for snacks today (Monday) but kept going up to the north of us until I lost sight of it.

11:30 -
I'm watching a whale-watching boat following
a gray mid-channel out between Mariners Cove and Utsalady
, prob closer to Camano than Whidbey. It appears to be feeding because it's moving very slowly north. Prob 2261 but too far away for visual confirmation. Have a good one!

10:53 -
Someone's been spouting way over in the channel toward
Utsalady
, heading south but slowly. We'll be in the lookout if it decides to come by once the tide comes back in a bit. Thanks! -Marianne Parry

Entry 3:
Possession Sound -

12:48 - Gray whales #2259 and 2262
in close association and traveling/feeding along the edge of river delta. Some really cool interactions between them! -Renee Chamberland
*

12:45 - Gray whales crc2259 and crc2262
are together on the edge of the
Snohomish River delta northeast of Hat Island
. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express
*

Entry 4:
Puget Sound/Elliott Bay -

17:15 -
Good morning, I saw the post on the Orca Network Facebook page asking for common dolphin sightings/reports so I am getting in touch and attaching some photos. I captain the Sailing Seattle sailboats out of Seattle's Pier 56 and this past Monday I had the unique experience of having a dolphin play in the bow wake of one of our 70-foot race boats. Having sailed the waters of Elliott Bay and the Central Puget Sound for thousands of hours I know a dolphin sighting in these waters is truly rare! I took many photos of this encounter so if there is a specific angle or image of the
dolphin
that will help you in your research please let me know and I can send more images your way. Direction of Travel: East bound from the middle of the bay all the way to the downtown Seattle waterfront off Pier 56. Thanks for all you do to promote the conservation of the Salish Sea and all of its inhabitants! -Craig McMaster

Cinco
. The spots are a match for his recent skin condition, and I could even see the notch on his dorsal fin that is the way that we do long-term matching." -Dave Anderson, Research Biologist, Cascadia Research Collective
