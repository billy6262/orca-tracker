Sat, Aug 19 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - As we travelled there was a shore based report of orcas off Salt Creek heading west so we hoped we could catch them. We found them still heading west and very close to shore about
6 miles west of Crescent Beach
. They made a turn out towards us and then we started noticing lots of harbor porpoise all around and even a harbor seal. There were quite a few orcas and they looked like they were in a semi resting mode. We figured there were at least two families there with the large number of Bigg's orcas. They traveled for a bit and then started milling in one place. Thinking they may have found a snack, we watched as they dove in one spot, and we never saw a chase but there was suddenly a lot of blood in the water and they were feeding. We believe they had found a seal hiding and flushed him out. The gulls also showed up for the meal. There were the
T109's, the T109A's and the T69's
. There were a few youngsters in the mix and they got to tail slapping a few times and we had one huge spyhop. -Lee, Island Adventures

GRAY WHALES - Wed, Aug 19, Northern Saratoga Passage -

08:00 - There is a (presumably)
gray spouting at north end of Camano
. It appears to be heading a little south and into the channel toward Whidbey, so maybe it smelled my coffee and is coming to join me. Update: I can confirm that it was
Gray 2261
- through binoculars I saw the white line. It looked like it was heading directly toward me (Mariners' Cove), but then there was some boat traffic so it disappeared for a few minutes and popped up further south, cruising in toward Polnell Shores. I lost sight of it just south of the rocks/happy meal mudflats, but I could hear it breathing, so I know it was just around the corner. Love that sound! -Marianne Parry

Entry 6:
~

12:45 -
Update: A whale-watcher followed Gray
from outside of Utsalady all the way over to the northern part of Mariners Cove
, and when the boat left (around
12:45p), it turned around and is currently headed back out into the channel toward Utsalady. Visual confirmation that it's 2261 (white stripe).

11:30 - Gray (prob 2261)
was hanging out near the strip of beach south of the bay at
Utsalady
(not sure what it's called) for a good 20 minutes or so and then did a big arched-back dive and popped up north a bit. Currently heading north-ish, but not sure if it's planning to stay on the Camano side or head to Whidbey. Looks like it might be moving toward mid-channel. Thanks! -Marianne Parry

Entry 7:
a lone common dolphin spent the day in Penn Cove
, Whidbey Island often bow riding the boats of Penn Cove Shellfish staff as they transited back and forth. Thanks to photos submitted by K. Cameron Dean
(
thanks to help by his dad Gordon Dean) both Dave Anderson & Laurie Shuster, Cascadia Research concurred the spot pattern were
a match to a known dolphin named "Cinco"
)
.
*
Later that evening he did have a companion
. Additional info: In the evening we saw him passing by the house and coming out of the water. Almost immediately there was a second breach that followed so quickly we assumed it was a second animal. We never actually saw two at once. -Thom Vader
[
"Yes, that appears to be
Cinco
. I can see his distinctive notch in the dorsal, which we use for long-term ID, as well as the more recent spot pattern from his current skin condition." -Dave Anderson, Research Biologist, Cascadia Research Collective

Here is the
dolphin that was in the [Penn] cove
today. -Kelly Stenson Stadler - photo - by Charles Camlin
(
comment from Matt Williams: "He was in Penn Cove all day yesterday! Riding the wake of all the boats at Penn Cove Shellfish!"
)

Entry 8:
Penn Cove/Whidbey Island -
The people who took the pictures and video work for Penn Cove Shellfish in
Coupeville
. Their rafts and loading dock are located to the West of Coupeville. My son, Cameron runs the boat at Penn Cove Shellfish and he is the one that took the pictures. He is working today (20th) so that is why I stepped into the mix. Now that he knows where to send stuff, I think you will be getting more. Sighting notes Cameron: "…He was there when we got to the water at

7:00 am
and was following boats from the beach to the rafts. He was still hanging around when we left the water at

2:00
. He would follow us out and wait for us to come back. Same at the beach. Every time our props spun up, he would get excited and speed towards us and breach...We made trips into the beach about every 45 minutes…" -Gordon Dean
