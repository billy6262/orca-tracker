"Thanks for the report! You did the right thing by stopping. Cinco is really attracted to boats, and loves to bow ride. The other option would be to continue without making any drastic changes to speed or course when he's around. That is when he is most likely to get hurt. Never try to approach him, but as you saw, he will often approach your boat if he's interested in playing." -Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective
