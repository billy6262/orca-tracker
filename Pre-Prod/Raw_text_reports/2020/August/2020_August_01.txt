Orca Sightings for August 1, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
16:30 -
I'm not sure what they were, but I'm pretty sure there were
at least two whales
(maybe three) just
northeast of North Peapod Rocks (near Lawrence Pt on Orcas)
. There appeared to be at least two whale watching boats observing them, but we were on Eagle Cliff on Cypress, so could only see the spouts and the occasional tail. Couldn't tell species from our distance… -Joshua Jabbour

Sunset - I also encountered orcas just
north of Holmes Harbor
on Saturday at 1850. Appeared to be
about eight in total
, divided into two groups of 3-4 with one male in each smaller group…And after anchoring offshore of Langley for the night Saturday evening, two of the orcas I had seen earlier at Holmes Harbor cruised past heading south. It was pretty choppy but I was hoping people in Langley spotted them. -Jordan Talge

What a fun time!!! 8/1/20: And they're back,
orcas in Penn Cove! T137s and T65As
....saw them first from Long Point (Whidbey Island) as they headed west into the cove. This time they got to just
east of the Coupeville wharf
, and after milling around, headed back out in spread out small groups. From Long Point again, we got some pretty nice close looks and saw a lot of breaching and tail slapping, over and over! They then headed south, so we decamped to Harrington Lagoon. A few came relatively close which was great! -Bonnie Gretz

. -Tyler McKeen

12:15 - [orcas]
They may have changed direction - or are milling.
12:15 pm mid channel between
Harrington Lagoon and Onomac
, looking slightly south from Harrington Lagoon.---It was a busy boat day on the water yesterday, crab pots all over and the orcas came to visit! They had a brief stop in Penn Cove, then headed back out to Saratoga Passage, southbound. Again it was a treat to see these whales, members of the
T65As and T137s
. Many breaches, and tons of tail slapping. Zoomed & cropped.
photo - "Jack!!! T137A (b.2002) - so glad to see he's totally recovered from his injury in 2019. "T65A and T65A5? - T137D and T137? -
-Jill Hein

11:56 -
Pod still northbound, moving quite quick, probably past Eagle Crest from my vantage point at
Indian Beach
, midchannel but slightly closer to Camano. Whale watching boat is still with them. At least one large male and several other smaller orcas. Traveling in a few different groups near each other. -Joan Smith
*

11:10 - Orcas have passed Fox Spit heading toward Greenbank
. Still in small groups. Close shoreline encounter with 3 whales at Fox Spit. --- What a great start to the month of August with the arrival of the
T137s
joining forces with the already-present-in-Puget Sound
T65As
. The last time we saw T137A in Whidbey waters he was suffering from an injury near the peduncle, inhibiting his movement. Our
August 1 encounter with this impressive whale was a far cry indeed from that worrisome sighting as he swept in like a scythe to cruise the Fox Spit shoreline and take gasping onlookers by surprise. Before any of us had chance to draw breath the whales submerged and surfaced further north in the direction of Greenbank and Baby Island, a favored seal haul-out, before continuing their travels in Saratoga Passage. -Sandra Pollard
