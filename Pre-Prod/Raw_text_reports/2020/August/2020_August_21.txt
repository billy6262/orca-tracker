Orca Sightings for August 21, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient/Bigg's Killer Whales (T018's with T019B - T019C & T090's) off Sooke B.C.
today after the fog and rain went away...Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations
*

Entry 2:
Haro Strait (T60s, T2B)
- Our sail today was cancelled due to a forecast of rain. The rain had cleared by late afternoon and we watched the
Biggs/Transient orcas T60's
from shore as they came around
Cattle Point Lighthouse
and headed up
San Juan Channel
. We met two of our upcoming passengers there and suggested an impromptu sunset sail. We met the orcas nearing Turn Rock and were able to sail alongside watching the sunset as they passed Friday Harbor. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

15:45-

16:10 - At Edwards Point. The T060s
had turned somewhere up island, heading south. I saw the vessels pretty far out in an orderly row but for many minutes I didn't see any whales. Puzzled I looked to my right and saw a male's fin extremely close in 1000' away. They pulled up in front of me so close that I had difficulty photographing them, so big in my viewfinder that I was clipping off heads. (250mm lens!). They went by fast;
Matriarch T060 with her newest calf T060G eyepatch still pink, T060C, T060D, T060E and T060F southbound
. Still speechless.

15:11. The T60s
(as per Monika Wieland Shields) came easterly inbound towards
Landbank/Westside Preserve
area. Raining, hard to see with binocs I made out 3 individuals incl. 2 lg males. They turned north up island. Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday

06:45 -
Today...Small pod of
Orcas, swimming close to shore about 4 miles north of Lime Kiln Point State Park
, heading south, towards the Park. -Spencer Cutter
*

Entry 3:
15:35 - Gray whale off Hunskor Hill, east of Mariner's Cove
at
3:35pm this afternoon. -Paula Despins
*

15:00 -
I just spotted some spouts across the channel toward Camano - looks like a
gray heading toward Utsalady
. It's hard to judge how far out in the channel it is because of the depth perception being so whacko in binocs. I can't confirm that it's 2261, but can't imagine it being anyone else.

11:00 - Gray 2261
came up from the south today (8/21/20, 11am), quite close to shore and feeding. It got up to our place (southern tip of
Mariners Cove
) and turned around and hustled back toward Polnell, with almost no feeding stops at all. It's very windy and choppy out there - maybe it prefers more protected waters. Hat tip to the Parhams, who alerted me that it was heading my way, and they txt'd me that it's still heading back toward Polnell Pt. as of
11:30am. I took loads of photos but it's a little challenging to spot the gray whale in the gray choppy water. I can confirm that it is 2261 since it was kind enough to reverse direction and show me the white line. -Marianne Parry

10:45 - Gray Whale feeding at Mariner's Cove
in Oak Harbor.---It was another one of those wonderful and cool days for walking our beach, and we were visited again by
Gray Whale #2261
(right?). Have a great day! -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor
[
"Yes, this is
2261
. Thanks!" -alb
