Orca Sightings for August 14, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

09:45 - Gray
(2261?) did indeed come across to Mariners Cove for a brief visit. After the last sighting out in the channel, it disappeared completely for prob 15 minutes or so - I might have missed a puff in the strip of sunshine on the water, but it was basically radio silence until it popped up a couple of houses up from me (yay!). It moved southward at a pretty good clip, with no friendly waves as it passed. Just to the south of Mariners Cove (traveled only maybe 1000' closer to shore), it turned back out into the channel and headed toward Camano again. Hopefully it's just waiting for the tide to come in a little more so the buffet is open.

08:59 -
I got lucky and happened to look in the right place at the right time and saw an enormous spout way in the channel toward the northern half of
Utsalady
. I can just barely see it in binoculars but not close enough to ID which gray. I'm pretty sure it's a gray though judging by the usual head shape. It appears to be heading a little more in my direction (
Mariners cove
), so I'll get back to you if I can get any photos or a good enough look to try to ID. The tide is still pretty low so it's a little early for the happy meal mudflats. -Marianne Parry

We saw one off
Fox Island
last Friday [Aug 14]. And we saw both together in front of Zittell's Marina for about a week in Mid-July. They are so playful. -Courtney Grubb
