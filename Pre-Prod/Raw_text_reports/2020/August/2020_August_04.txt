Orca Sightings for August 4, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T65As & T137s)
- [We found] the T137's porpoising at great speed, eastbound, wondering what the hurry was...and of course they were on the move to meet up with the T065A's coming west...When they finally greeted each other they stopped and mingled for quite some time...Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

Entry 2:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

15:30-

16:00 -
Excited to report that after a few days (3?) absence,
Gray 2356
has returned to
Mariners Cove
. Yay!
3:30pm 8/4/20 - I spotted it heading south from the marina entrance, slowly working his way down, feeding all along. It is quite close to shore, feeding and moving along very slowly and methodically. As of 4pm, it is just south of Mariners Cove, heading toward Polnell. The markings by the blowholes and pectoral fin clearly show that it's 2356. I know it looks like I'm in the water right next to the whale, but I can assure you I was on the beach - it was pretty close in, plus I zoomed. The magnificence never ceases to amaze... Have a great rest of your day! -Marianne Parry
