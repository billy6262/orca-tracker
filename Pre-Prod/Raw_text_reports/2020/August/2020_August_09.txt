On way home from Eagles Island/Anderson Island. We were boating home with our dogs and saw the big ones between us and
Harstine
. We were just past Joemma. They were really far to the west of us and we thought they were moving North but we stopped between Herron and McMicken Island to eat our dinner and hoping to see them but we lost track. They must have headed back south. Best news is there were NO boats!! -Jennifer Lindsay
*

18:49 -
I was sitting on my porch and saw them so I thought I would post. Too far for my phone to take a pic and was trying to take in the moment. They were playing around across the way with 2 boats at a distance. As more boats approached they moved on.

Entry 5:
Northern Saratoga Passage - ~

19:00 -
Our friend Gray came up toward
Mariners Cove
from the south around 7pm tonight, feeding in its' usual happy place by the rocks just south of Mariners' Cove. Rather than continuing on up close to shore though, it headed out into the channel and made a bee-line for the northern tip of Utsalady on Camano. I lost sight of the spouts before it got there, so it may have veered north into Skagit Bay. I haven't memorized the non-white-line side yet, but the flipper and tail fluke are distinctive. There are some relatively OK shots of the knuckles as it prepares to dive. They're the photos with the boat very close by (and a couple of others) - the boat was just sitting there for quite a while just watching from a good distance, but the whale decided to pass by them pretty darn close when it stopped feeding and headed out into the channel. Must have been a thrill! -Marianne Parry
*

08:40 - Gray is leaving Polnell
shores. -Terra Parham

We had another

16:24 -
Some kind of
dolphin/porpoise jumping in Hales
[Hale Passage] across from the east end of Echo Bay. If I had to guess, it was a common dolphin. Lighter grey rather than the dark of a harbor porpoise. -Mignon Marie Whitaker
*
MINKE WHALES - Sun, Aug 9 - Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca - We made our way to Iceberg Point and on seeing a distant Minke whale through binoculars headed out to McArthur Bank. After scanning our way across McArthur Bank with no further sightings, we decided to head out to
Smith Island
. The kelp forests here are in their prime and we found over a dozen tufted puffins some with beaks full of fish. After watching the puffins and cruising looking for the one and only horned puffin, we came across a
Minke whale
. The minke was really fun to watch as she traveled and surfaced lunge feeding amongst groups of birds. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
