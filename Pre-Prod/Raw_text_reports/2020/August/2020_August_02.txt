Entry 8:
August 2nd, we were enjoying the view from Harborview Park
north of Mukilteo
when we saw a
low bushy blow
fairly close to shore. A single whale was surfacing with a succession of blows, followed by dives that lasted approximately 5 to 8 minutes. No dorsal fin visible; the whale did not breach the surface or raise its back end before dives. We did catch one good sighting of the tail, which was dark and smooth, with somewhat pointy tips. We watched him for about 20 minutes as he travelled slowly southwest roughly parallel to the shoreline. I am pretty sure we were looking at a minke, given the bushy blows and the small size. Of course, it's tough to tell size from shore sometimes, but I think we can rule out humpback since humpbacks have that characteristic tall, columnar blow so different from what we were seeing. Ok, thanks! I enjoy following whale sightings on Orca Network -- it's fun to have a surprise sighting to report! -Cheers, Erica Peterson

Entry 9:
05:55 -
I saw what
appears to be a humpback
mid-channel just
south of Gedney Island
at 0555. Appeared to be heading north. The first image is the best look I had at the dorsal fin. Couldn't tell if it was the classic irregular humpback shape, but because I was close enough to see a definite dorsal, I assumed it was a humpback not a gray. But the location is exactly where you'd expect to see grays. -Jordan Talge
