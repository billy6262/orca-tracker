Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage -
The only puffs I heard for a few days have been from my pug, so no whale action, but a few minutes ago I heard a big one - lol. Cruising southbound past
Mariners Cove
toward the happy meal mudflats, appears to be feeding. It's pretty close to shore now, but we know it has a tendency to head into the channel after the mudflats, so hopefully it can stay safe in the fog - it's beginning to lift. -Marianne Parry
