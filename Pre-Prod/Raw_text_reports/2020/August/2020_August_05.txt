Orca Sightings for August 5, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:43 - A solitary Minke
was spotted just south of the entrance to the channel into
Eagle Harbor on Bainbridge
Island at 1043 this morning. It was moving stealthily southward away from the ferry lane, briefly causing the out-of-service Wenatchee to stop briefly. -Scott Markowitz
*
Fri, Aug 7 - Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca - Passing Cattle Point Lighthouse, we rode the last of the ebb out to
Salmon Bank
. After some searching, patience paid off with fine views of a
minke whale
. The light winds allowed us to sail slowly on main sail alone as he surfaced nearby. From here we raised the headsail again to head back to Whale Rocks. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Entry 2:
B.C. Gulf Islands
-

19:45 - We are visiting a friend on
Mayne Island

three adult orcas and one baby in Horton Bay
, Mayne Island, at about
7:45 pm. Our host has been here for 30 years and has never seen them here. -Jack Huberman

Entry 3:
North Puget Sound (T65As and T137s) -

They've cruised past

Kim Page called to report seeing
3-4 orcas
, including one male, half way

Just left them east of
Point No Point
in the separation zone, hunting. -Trevor Tillman

Volunteer Karen Graham called to report seeing the orcas who are now approaching

Entry 4:
Saratoga Passage -

16:30 - Gray
somehow snuck around to the north and came back by again heading south, and then turned around once again. 8/5/20,
16:30, south end of Mariners Cove - I spotted it heading south toward my place, watched it cruise by assuming it was heading for Polnell, and then it turned toward Utsalady and is now doing some deep dives moving northward midchannel. When it passed me, it was pretty close to shore and feeding heavily, splishing and splashing about (compared with earlier today when it was feeding but very calmly). I assume the water was quite shallow because it stuck the fin and tail fluke up really high. Lots of photos taken, but only with iPhone, but I send along any that look tolerable. -Marianne Parry
*

14:15 -
Just heard a spout so ran out to look, and there was the
gray whale just barely south of Mariners Cove
, feeding and slowly heading toward Polnell. I suspect it flew in from across the channel because no neighbors to my north appear to have seen anything, but can't confirm that. Both blowhole stripe and the [usual] pectoral fin. Just sneaking by today with very little commotion. Such a chill whaleâ€¦ Have a good one! -Marianne Parry

Entry 5:
09:50
today, a
Pacific White-sided Dolphin
was spotted approaching the outbound
Seattle-Bainbridge ferry
, accompanying the ferry, breaching in the wake, and later following the outbound Seattle-Bremerton ferry. This observation was made by the state ferries Coleman Dock PSO/MMO. The first contact was directly north of Luna Park about 100 meters north of the Seattle- bound ferry Puyallup. Followup: Yes, 100% [PWD], got good views from the ferry sun deck at 25 meters. No photos yet, but I have the camera here today. This was not one of the Commons, no bottle noise, sharp bicolored crescent dorsal, suspenders...Scott Markowitz
