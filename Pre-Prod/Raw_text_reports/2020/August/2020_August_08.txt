Now it looks like they're in the middle between
Vashon, Gig Harbor
, and Point Defiance. Lots of surface activity.

18:56 -
Looks like they're hunting or milling in the middle of the channel off the
southwest tip of Vashon
. Just saw a gigantic splash.

side, west of the ferry. One male dorsal and two female dorsals at least. Headed west.

18:33 -
Seeing at least one male dorsal and several females off the
south tip of Maury Island

. -Sandhya Ballal

15:35 - 3 females or adolescents just passed Three Tree Point
. Very sneaky. Took a couple breaths and disappeared. Past the mid channel marker. I also saw at least 1 adult male and 1 female right off Seahurst, Burien. Both groups 5ish mins since seen last. I'm in a kayak so they'd be super hard to miss. Southbound group of 3, group of 2+ off Seahurst milling then vanished. -Christina Van Wolbeck Fenerty
*

15:30 -
My family and I just observed a pod of at least 5 orca traveling south near the
Fauntleroy ferry dock
. They appeared to be foraging, with fairly frequent surfacings but only long enough for breathing, no spyhops or breaches or similar activity. There was at least one, and seemingly two, fairly young whales traveling at the front, often surfacing together and very near one another, and at least one older male bringing up the rear. There was another I believe younger male in the middle, mostly alone. I believe I originally saw an older female up front with one of the young but the longer I watched, the less I detected that individual. One whale watch vessel and three other smaller motorboat/sailboats were following at largely respectful distances and speeds. -Mary Huff

I saw a
humpback
two nights ago [8/8] from Richmond Beach -- The blow was huge, and was lit up golden in the sunset light. She let out a huge breath and then dove. Glorious. Followup: Evening of Saturday, Aug 8th, closer to the

MINKE WHALES - Sat, Aug 8 - Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca - We circled Long Island before sailing to tack our way out to
Salmon Bank
in light winds looking for
minke whales
. We had several close passes as she meandered around us. Moving onwards over McArthur Bank wing on wing sailing brought us to Colville Island. We rounded Castle Island where a pair of bald eagles watched us drift pass from high on the cliff. McCardle Bay was paradise with steep cliffs and emerald waters. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Entry 3:
August 9th at

14:57
to report a sighting from yesterday evening (Aug 8): About 6-7pm he was seeing who he thought was
probably medium/small humpback in Gig Harbor at Point Fosdick
area (end of) across from Fox Island, between Wollochet Bay and Narrows. He saw one, slaps his fluke down 5-6 times, maybe playing, in shallow water, maybe 10-20 feet of water. Very cool saw him through trees a couple times. I don't think large humpback or gray…kind of mid size or smallish whale…curious if anyone else saw them.
