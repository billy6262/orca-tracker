============================================================

Entry 1:
4:10 Three humpbacks inside the mouth of Eagle Cove
southbound towards Granny's Cove. Flukes up: two very white undersides of flukes and one dark with white patches towards the tips.
4:20 South of Granny's headed towards South Beach. Love seeing their grand exhales being carried in the wind! -Lodie Gilbert Budwill
