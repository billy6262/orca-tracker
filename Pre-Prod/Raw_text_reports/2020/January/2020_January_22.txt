Entry 1:

Just tuned in to
Port Townsend hydrophone
and thought I heard

15:52 -
Just saw two? I think splashing
southbound between south Whidbey and Kitsap
side. Viewing through telescope from
Mukilteo
. -Alice Thuy Talbot

15:35
(approx.) - They are either being super stealthy or just lost in the swells and white caps, last view they were still headed south and closer to Whidbey side (
3:35 ish) 1 mi south of Bush Pt. So far have only seen about
7 - 8 total
from both groups, but we know more are out there!

15:30 -
Just saw
three more
, really porpoising/splashing - possibly chasing salmon (we hope!) or just playing in the swells, but looked like pretty focused behavior so hopefully catching a big salmon! Direction still
southbound
. Last sighting of the earlier pod further south was
SE of Point No Point Lighthouse
.

at
