Oh my goodness I'm in the Arroyos They just passed me super close, group of five to six I think.
3:10 p.m. northbound slowly with two large males, I think. I'm too excited to think but just know they're northbound close to West Seattle shore on my way to the next spot. A peaceful moment for me, as I stood alone on shore in the Arroyos. T-87 was the first to appear out of the fog. My heart simultaneously stopped and raced. The group slowly came together and moved northwest toward Fauntleroy.

Intense clip of the day. After getting text from Peter Altmann, we debated to take the paddleboards or skiff out in front of
Salmon Beach
this morning. Took the skiff. Cut the motor to just float and watch the Orcas pass (northbound). They head straight for us. Yesterday and today
more than 20 Transient Orca
were again present near us. Awesome! -Zeno Martin

(approx.) - I saw them off of

16:50 -
The group is
past Blake island heading in towards Bremerton
. Looks like they made a kill. Don't know if they will continue on towards Bremerton or back out. They were between Bainbridge and the fuel facility. Close to the ferry lane. They stayed there for quite a while. It looked like they made multiple kills. -Jim Pasola

13:16 - Hugging Tacoma shore
, headed straight to
Owen Beach
, as viewing from Sunrise Beach/Dalco Passage. "The lead group had already passed on and was near
Point Robinson
at that time. The 2nd group that I was observing appeared from my vantage point on the
Gig Harbor side at Sunrise Beach
to be headed towards Dune Peninsula, mid channel, and following the trajectory of the 1st group. Then, they disappeared for maybe 5-10 min and popped up in Colvos which was super surprising. Visibility was poor, so it's possible I missed them resurfacing in those 5-10 min." -Anika Blake

Entry 6:

13:00-

13:15 -
I didn't see them pass Owen and there were reports at around
3:25 of seeing the
pod in Colvos
. Last I had eyes on them was when they were milling. I saw about 3 of them turn Southwest. I would have stayed, but visibility was getting poor and with all the rain we've had I was uneasy about the huge wall of land behind me. The blue dot is roughly the furthest east I saw them and the green dot is about when I last had eyes on them. -Ashley Whitman

Here's a clip of the second group of seven transient orcas passing northbound in the Tacoma Narrows. Decent audio too of breathing. This was taken from our skiff with motor off, floating and watching. We observed this group of seven and the hour earlier group of seven both pass nearby harbor seals that were floating very still. Neither group seemed to be doing any feeding, just travelling. -Zeno Martin
