Hi! I'd like to report an
orca sighting off the Ediz Hook in Port Angeles
!...Yes it's currently happening! Apparently they've been around for a few hours now. There's a couple of them--
probably more than 3
. They started in the harbor side of the Hook and went around it, they're currently headed west out towards the ocean. -Shelagh Sweeney
