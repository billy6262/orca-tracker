Orca Sightings for January 27, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
14:00 (approx.)
- We had a big orca pod
(6 or 7 whales) visiting the Strait of Georgia
today. I took the picture off
Mayne Island
. They were traveling southeast toward Saturna [Island], quite far into the Strait. Close bunch. I think I saw a baby. It was just before 2pm today. -Yves Tiberghien

T124As, T124C, and maybe the T2Cs
