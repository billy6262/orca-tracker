A protected species monitor saw
4 (including one calf) at
14:35 near Jack Block park
moving toward port. Now at
15:18 they may be on a kill as there has been tail slapping and numerous gulls around. Both teams monitoring projects at the Port and Colman Dock are aware and pile driving is shut down. -Glenn Johnson

Saw one of them from my office above Smith Tower. They were
moving North along the waterfront
. -Rebecca Benson

15:04 - A group of orca, at least 3 and one calf, currently in Elliott Bay
, aprox 2-3 km from Colman Dock ferry terminal toward Port/Jack Block park. Perhaps T's on a kill. Monitors for the Port and WSF pile driving projects are aware. -Glenn Johnson

15:02 - We have four Orcas in Elliott Bay. Three females and a calf
. By Jack Block Park. I have not got a visual of them, one of our observers is watching them. I assume transients, which pod has three females and a calf? -Stefanie Hawks-Johnson

Just spotted approximately
6 Orcas just north of Harbor Island in Elliott Bay

Hi, My name Katie McDermott and I'm back with another sighting (hearing?) report. I'm not sure if this counts as a sighting or if you want to know what is
heard over a hydrophone
, but I'm going to report it anyways. I was listening to the Lime Kiln Hydrophone tonight and from about

9:25 PM to
9:30 PM and heard, quite faintly, whales
. I am not sure of what species the calls were from, but I thought that It was cool and should probably be reported. (unlike last time, I am not going to jump to conclusions about what type of whales I heard.) It went silent (except for the water noise) for a few minutes, but I heard them again at
9:36 PM as well as at
9:38 PM and then again from
9:41 PM to
10:30. After
10:30, I had to turn it off because I have school in the morning, so I don't know how long it lasted for after that. The whole time I was listening (
9:25 PM- 10: 30 PM) the calls were off and on and were quiet, although not as faint as they were initially. I hope you have a great rest of your week! -Katie McDermott

are currently audible on the
Orcasound Lab hydrophones
hosted by Beam Reach on the west side of San Juan Island in Haro Strait! -Scott Veirs, Beam Reach & Orcasound
