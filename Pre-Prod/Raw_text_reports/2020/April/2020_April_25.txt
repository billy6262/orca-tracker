Entry 3:
Potlatch at southern end of Hood Canal
. They heard
the whale
last night (24th) and again this morning neighbors heard the whale, and then many of them, herself included, saw the whale, a gray or humpback. First saw the whale coming out of the water and could see it's long back and blowhole, just 2 feet off their dock. Whale was first traveling south into Anna's Bay then eventually turned around and traveled north.

Entry 4:
3 gray whales including #49 and #383
were definitely present. ID on 3rd whale not confirmed.
SE of Gedney Island
today. They were spy hopping like crazy! ...the whales I saw never fluked and only Patch showed his dorsal ridge enough to make a good field ID. The 3rd whale was noticeably larger than 49 and 383 so I assumed it was a female but I couldn't make a positive ID.

- Hello, we've had the same gray whale feeding out front for several hours Friday and Saturday. We're in Langley, on the water between the ferry and Sandy Point, across from Hat [Island]. I have a pretty good, short video if you'd like it. Thanks! -video by Lara Nolan

Entry 7:
Northern Saratoga Passage
- [We] live on Whidbey Island and saw 3 whales very active off coast at
seaplane base
on Friday evening and yesterday evening they were there but not active. By their sounds I think they may be humpbacks. They have a small dorsal fin, water spray often and stayed just below surface and when they sprayed you could only see from the blow hole to the dorsal fin. It'd be interesting to know what type of whale they are. They are in
Crescent Harbor
off seaplane base. I'm looking at a map and I guess they are heading southeast. Friday, they were just off shore of the old flight line, and yesterday they were
heading toward Skagit Bay
