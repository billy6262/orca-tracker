Orca Sightings for April 8, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
19:30 -
Hello,
orcas in Henderson Bay
, 4/8/2020,
7:30pm. Saw
mom and maybe two young, the white/light color one
with them. They were heading toward Purdy. I heard there were about 5 when they were at the opening of Wollochet around
6:30 ish, so maybe more are here in Henderson Bay. -Terry Shovlowsky

Entry 2:
T46Bs & T46D, T65As
) -

19:00 - About 5-6 Orcas in Carr Inlet
. Heading North past Kopachuck State Park around
7:00, so probably in Henderson Bay now at
7:45pm. Haven't seen them head back south. FYI, we live on Carr Inlet so we are maintaining social distancing. -Sarah Richey Guenther
*

18:52 - Orcas off West Point of Fox Island
. Came through Hale Pass. Second pass in the last hour. Headed west. -Cari Black
*

18:45 -
There are orca whales that
just passed under the Fox Island Bridge
and about eight boats that are following way too close. The
pod with the white calf passed under
about thirty minutes ago (about 7 whales) and then just now 4 whales passed under. Boaters are cutting off the whales and trying to get ahead of them to get a good view. -Carly Hanson
*

18:30 - Orcas sighted in Carr Inlet
at
6:30pm. Many boats following. -Dale Wilkins
*

18:00 (approx.) -
On Tuesday, on north bluff around 6pm, a pod of orcas was in front of our place. Looked like they were fishing.
5 to 6 orcas
. Two huge orcas, two smaller, and two juvenile orcas. Then headed up north bluff a mile north, circling in close to shore. -Carolyn Mercer
*

22:15 -
They were back at our address at
10:15pm, and we don't know where they are now.

17:05 - Tl'uk (and company) were at our address at
5:05pm
on
April 8, and at
5:20pm. They headed west and under Fox Island bridge around
5:32pm, at which time we lost track of them. --We have optimistically hoped a day would come that we would see orcas from our house looking south to Fox Island across Hale Passage, never really expecting the day would come. (Our neighbors had never seen them in 26 years.)

Entry 3:
orca pod (and a white orca -- Tl'uk??)
off our balcony this afternoon. As they traveled in front of our house, we went down to the Cromwell Road below and followed them to the Fox Island bridge. The best thing that has happened so far as we shelter in place! -Linda & Patrick McMullen
[
ID note: There were two different families down there. T65As were in the area, as well. They came through in late afternoon/early evening about 90 minutes after
T46Bs (Tl'uk's family)
. So it is possible, unless you saw the white whale, the group who passed by in the dark (
10:15) was
T65As
. -alb

They were in
Wollochet Bay
[4/8] and went
under the Fox Island bridge near Gig Harbor
! -Kimberly Wenner

17:00-

18:30 - Orcas in Hale Passage
4/8 between

5:00-
6:30pm or so. Two separate groups! -Karen Nixon Hale
*

18:00 -
The same group came by again at 1800
west of Point Fosdick (Gig Harbor)
about 100 meters off shore heading west towards the Fox Island bridge. More boats transiting the area. I will send a photo of the group later today. photo - [
T65As

16:30 - Group of 4 orca--1 male with big dorsal
, 1? adult female and 2 juveniles? at Point Fosdick near shore,
heading towards the Fox Island bridge
at 1630 on 8 April. Heavy boat traffic including 2 jet skis in the area. Thanks for getting back to me - great to know who we saw, and that you can recognize both individuals and groups! We've lived here for 5 years and never seen orcas from here before, although our neighbors have seen them rarely in the past. We usually see harbor porpoises, but haven't for several months. Harbor seals are still regularly seen, but no sea lions for a few months. I assume that both groups went on through Hale Passage and under the Fox Island bridge to get into Carr Inlet as we didn't see them come back in our direction. We are about 300 feet from the beach up the hill- these [photos] were taken with a 500mm lens from the deck.

Hello! Just wanted to let you know I spotted
some orca
- saw dorsals and spouts. Just now - around
3:40. Milling/ hunting. Viewed from the
Dunes area by Point Defiance
. They appear to be over around
Dalco Passage
- I think I'm looking at Sunrise Beach on the Kitsap side as the closest landmark. Spotted with binoculars & I'm way too far away to be able to get more specifics. -Heidi Armstrong

In sight again. About a mile south of the traffic lane buoy
off Three Tree Point

14:00 -
We live on Deception Road off Dewey Beach (technically the waters are
Skagit Bay
) and saw
a gray whale
on
April 8 around 2pm feeding close to shore... very shallow as tides were low. We watched him/her surface and spout air several times... I finally was able to get a photo (sorry a long shot with my android phone) as it was cruising west towards Deception Pass. I was actually concerned it might be a whale in distress so called NOAA hotline for stranded/distressed marine animals. They were non-plussed but noted my sighting and said several other neighbors had also called in sightings. No other info or recommends were provided. I notified my neighbors via Nextdoor App of a whale sighting in the hood and discovered several other neighbors had been observing two or more grays in Skagit Bay that week including an observed breach! I now understand they are likely one of the "Sounders" that pass thru on their migration north and are feeding (and fattening up) on ghost shrimp. This is all very exciting and cool to observe and many neighbors have now established a text group to share whale sightings. Best Regards, -Lynne Wenberg-Davidson

Entry 7:
18:00 -
Please see a couple of videos of
a mom and baby gray whale taken from the western shore of Elger Bay
on Wednesday
April 8, 2020 at around 6 PM. It is my understanding that they are essentially foraging for ghost shrimp in the sandy bottom of Elger Bay. I also heard them in the bay the following two evenings about the same time but did not go down to the waterfront. I hope this is helpful! Regards, -Ed Perkins

Entry 8:

t, in Oak Harbor, WA. He/she made the usual rounds and then headed out. -Greg and Terra Parham
