Orca Sightings for April 21, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
19:00 (time of msg.) -
2 whales seen from East Point
fog house. Appear to be mature orcas? Rogue? Diving off the seal rock quite far out. We had neither camera or glasses!
Saturna Island
, where we have been hiding from the virus for 5 weeks. Have not seen a whale until last evening and we walk at least twice a day. These
2 were quite far out in Boundary Channel
, heading north toward Boundary Bay, or Cherry Point in your country. They have no regard for the crossing restrictions between Canada and US. Keep up the good work. Cheers. -William Thomas

Entry 2:
11:56 - From the north edge of Hannah Hts., I observed a single humpback
traveling to the N/W away from the island, surfacing and diving many times. It had a white mark or patch on the trailing edge of its dorsal fin.

Entry 4:

07:45 -
Hello, I live on
Strawberry Point on Whidbey Island
and I saw
a grey whale
headed south/southwest past the opening of Mariner's Cover Marina at

07:30 -
07:45 this morning. The whale was moving pretty quick and only surfaced 3 times in the length of more than a football field or so. It was cruising parallel to shore maybe less than 50 meters from the beach. It was pretty long (40 feet or something?) and was very blotchy and possibly covered in barnacles. It wasn't smooth and just one color. It had ridges along its back toward the tail. The front of its head was quite a prominent, round point, similar to other grey whales I've seen, so that's why I'm guessing it was a grey whale. It was darker greyish brown toward the tail. I hope this helps. -Ty Tuin

Today this
Gray
came by for lunch. We are on the
east side of Camano
and have been visited by Grays, usually two, in the last three days. Last evening it was right at our dinner time. Best dinner entertainment in the world! -Mary Pelland
