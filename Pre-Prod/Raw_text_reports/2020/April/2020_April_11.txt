Sat, Apr 11 - Port Susan - We have enjoyed seeing and hearing whales from our home here on the shores of
Port Susan
for almost 20 years now. I have not reported any of our sightings this year as it was
happening on a daily occurrence (almost an entire month worth from late March to late April.
I feel as if they are semi-native to the area regarding their annual pilgrimage. Mostly solo travelers but occasionally 3 or 4 and once we noted a momma and her calf. Such majestic sentient beings. The image is from my beach walk on
April 11th when
3 or 4 appeared to be feeding in the shallows between Kayak Point and McKee's Beach
. I will keep an eye out and report any further sightings on the network. Stay well and all the best. -photo by Douglas Barlow -
