Looks like
2 Bigg's whales in shipping lane near Whidbey, across from Skunk Bay and Kitsap Peninsula
....active diving looks like hunting lessons for littler whale, home schooling for everyone. [Asked for direction of travel]... I saw them near the shipping lanes mostly on the east side, on the outside of the ship lanes toward the center of Admiralty, going east then reversing and going west, obviously hunting, mostly staying on the surface with shallow dives. They could have been in pursuit of a harbour seal. There were only two, one about half the size of the larger one. Bigger one had a nice tall dorsal... the side white patterns (saddle) were smaller and not as distinct. I caught a double blow in my binocs or I would have missed them entirely... very active. It looked like they were having fun. There have been a few harbour seals hanging around but that was closer to Point No Point. I lost track after the wind started causing a lot more surface waves. They avoided being too close to the traffic... smart, aware whales. I was impressed. The distance from my house near Foulweather Bluff and my sighting was about 2 - 3 miles (to Mutiny Bay)...long distance, but enough for me to assume Bigg's not [Southern Resident] orcas by markings. When they went farther east to Useless Bay, I lost them. Wind and waves began to make it hard to keep a good location after about a half an hour. -Kathleen Higgins

They motored by northbound towards PNP. There was one male, and at least one female and juvenile. I got a couple of photos but they are not very good. Will look at them when I can.

We are watching a grey whale go by. He is on the east side of
Camano Island in Port Susan
sound. We are on the southern tip of the Island. He is going north to south so he is leaving the sound. We have only seen the one so far. -Terri Smith
