Orca Sightings for April 13, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Case Inlet (T46Bs and T46D) - Transients in Allyn, WA
. I observed them during a real low tide sometimes I think they were in 6' of water working the shoreline then they would circle back quietly into a little deeper water I assume this I when they consume the seals? The numerous seals I saw would stay more towards the other shore and would look to see what was happening. We tried to stay a reasonable distance away from them but sometimes they go under and suddenly appear.

My husband said that there was
an albino orca
in the pod! Such a treat to see them. They've been here for the last 2 hours. We moved to Washington partly because we love the orcas so much. They are a gift!

I took the video from the water's edge, approximately 3/4 to 1 mile from North end of Canal... video is facing West toward Allyn. They had traveled down to end of canal, North.... and had turned around and came back heading South.... Thats when I took the video. They went back and forth from South to North, about a 2-mile range?? -Rebecca Colello

There is currently a
pod of orca
, presumably, Bigg's in
north Case Inlet off of Treasure Island and Allyn
. I haven't seen them personally - I'm south of there on Harstine Island - but friends on Treasure Island are currently watching them. Seem to be mingling there, so may be feeding. Lots of harbor porpoise in my area. Apparently, there is at least one baby/juvenile in the pod, been there since at least
10:30am; it's now
2:30pm on 4/13. -Dave Berliner
