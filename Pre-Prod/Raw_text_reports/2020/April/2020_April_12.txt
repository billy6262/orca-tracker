Orca Sightings for April 12, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:50 -
Hi Orca Network, I saw three whales from the shore at
Friday Harbor Labs
today around
11:50 am. They disappeared SE
between Turn Island and San Juan Island through the boat channel around
12:15 pm
. I think they were transients based on their movement style. They were originally very close to the shore heading north, so I could hear them breathing, but they went under and resurfaced after several minutes much further out toward Turn Island. I think they may have been hunting because they stayed in their far location (shown in the video) for some time, and I could see them arching their backs and some splashing at the surface from time to time. Their breathing was more steady by the time they headed SE through the boat channel. -Best regards, Holly Shelton

Entry 2:
(T46Bs & T46D).

16:56 - Large pod of orcas in the middle of Henderson Bay
right now, including what looks to be small albino... is there such a thing?? -Chris Reed
*

14:38 - Orcas
out again now! Oh, and the white one has been with the pod each time. Just
north of Joe's Bay
. -Maggie Walters
*

14:33 -
They were north, heading a little west towards the
Town of Home
. I've lost sight of them now though. There were about 8 boats milling about, and they are now heading north towards Henderson Bay so I imagine that's where the whales have gone.

13:58 - Orcas
, including the white one, visible from
Penrose Point State Park
. Going back and forth, scaring the seals. Watching with binoculars from shore, too far away to get a picture. -Valerie Dansey Aspee
*

14:00 -
Easter sighting! Just outside
Joe's Bay
. 4-12-20 at 2pm. I was surprised by how many boats were near them. -Neil Bender
*

13:00
(approx.) - There are two mammals in the Inlet
- T46B1 and T46B1B "Tl'uk"
- a little further away so not great quality I'm afraid. One grey, one black. Is it possible the black mammal is an Orca separated from the main group? It looks so different to the other but I'm not experienced enough to know! The first picture looks like the grey one is just resting its head on the other's back; I swear it was smiling! They were the only ones I saw all day and seemed to be on their own. Thank you in advance for any insight you can provide! -Best wishes, Jennifer Swenson

Entry 3:
at least 3 Orcas (1 large and 2 or 3 small ones)
mid-channel, close to our beach. They circled and came up for air many times during about 15 minutes. They then began moving southward in the Bay. There was a small boat with three people in it and a kayak with one person observing them from the water. -Marie Tjernlund

10:22 -
We keep seeing one that was much lighter than the others.

10:20 -
They've been in the bay a few times this week. They head in eastward, milled about, rolled, and did some tail slaps and one spy hop. Now they're heading back out of bay going west.

Still watching them, I think five. Will send some pics.

were in front of our house Easter morning, 4/12/20 @
7:30 am. This is
Carr Inlet
. We live on the Key Peninsula, very close to Maple Hollow Park. They were very close to shore. They were moving slowly north. We have seen a lot of seal action the last few days. It is unusual for us to see orcas in this part of the sound. -Arleigh Lievense

The
transient pod with the white orca is in Henderson Bay
this morning. Heading south, between the spit and Camp Seymour at 6am. -CJ Clawson

Sun, Apr 12 - Skagit Bay - Hi Folks! I saw something about you guys on the KOMO4 site and thought I'd drop the note. I live in La Conner, and I look out at
Hope Island State Park and the northern tip of Whidbey Island.
We've enjoyed some
gray whales (2, maybe 3?) in our bay here this past week
. They
showed up Monday morning the 6th, and we last saw them Easter Sunday the 12th
. I got some great photographs from a few hundred yards away, then Easter Sunday, they surprised me when our paths crossed and I ended up very close to them. Happy to share the pictures and/or video I got. By the way, also in the bay here on Monday the 6th were a couple of dolphins (porpoises? - sorry, not an expert!), plus some "extra activity" with our usual/resident seals "rounding up minnows" by circling around them and the water pretty much exploding with the minnows/herring(?) jumping out of the water. At one point, there were whales, dolphins and seals all on different sides of the kayak. -Cheers! Todd Cowles

Entry 4:
Port Susan - We hear feedings
on our beach almost daily. Low tide today brought the evidence [gray whale feeding pits revealed at low tide]. -Linda Thomson
*

Entry 5:
08:00 -
Easter Sunday, we saw
a gray whale at about 8 AM entering Penn Cove on the east side of Whidbey Island
. It swam in almost to the wharf, then turned and went back out. It looked as if it were looking for food; would go under for several minutes, then we would see and hear the air coming from the blowhole. It was moving relatively quickly. It was in the cove for only 20-30 minutes. -Pat and Lily Stanwood

17:35 -
Karen Graham, volunteer called: she's right
off Hidden Beach seeing 1 gray whale heading north
about mid channel. The whale is just past were you drive up to Hidden Beach, about 1/4 mile ahead now, but she could still see him blow. Apparently, he came from around Hidden Beach, he was seen around there. Happy Easter and stay well.

We saw
two gray whales
on Easter morning, 12
April 2020. We watched them from
7:10 am to
9:00 am. They were
in front of the seawall at Langley
, WA. 48°02'30.3"N 122°24'38.0"W. It was high tide at the time. At low tide, the area they were working is exposed mud flats. They were feeding in water about 10 feet deep. They stayed in about the same spot the whole time. They were not traveling through. One was large and the other about half the size. We think it was a mother and baby. The baby had a distinctive orange spot on its tail fluke. A friend took many excellent photos with his high-end camera and enormous lens. I encouraged him to send you his photos. -Regards, Peter Oakley, Langley

UNCONFIRMED BALEEN WHALES - Sun, Apr 12 - Central Puget Sound - Hello, I saw on komo's website that you're taking whale sightings by email, so I wanted to report
a single baleen whale
that I saw on Sunday
around 3pm
. It was travelling north at a moderate pace, and was west of mid-channel outside the mouth of
Eagle harbor
. I caught 3 blows that all looked heart-shaped which made me think humpback, but I was observing from quite far away with binoculars. I was on Alki Point, just East of the lighthouse. The whale dove with a low arching motion and then was out of sight. Thanks for continuing to do all the great monitoring and cataloging! -Best Regards, Patrick Hutchins
