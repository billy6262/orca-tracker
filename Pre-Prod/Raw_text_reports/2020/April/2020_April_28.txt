Orca Sightings for April 28, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30 - Randy Betcher? called to report whales in
Crescent Harbor by the sea plane base, Whidbey Island. Believes gray whales (thought 4-5) in a group. Reports seeing them surface and appeared to be chasing something like feeding. Playing around having a good time in the harbor then headed off towards Polnell Point.

Entry 2:
Southern Saratoga Passage -

14:30 -
If this is Earhart, she is becoming a regular! Today at
2:30 this whale approached
Pebble Beach
from the north. She swam slowly, coming up to blow often, swimming right under the surface of the water. She continued this behavior southward, till she was out of sight. I think it is Earhart (?), who yesterday breached half her length out of the water! -photos by Peg Boley -

came for breakfast this morning, yes I could watch this all day! Her belly didn't used to surface that much. Hopefully they are all eating well with an abundance of shrimp. [2nd gray surfaces in one of Lori's videos -alb]. -Lori Christopher
