I was in a boat in the

Stories Beach (Campbell River). A pod of no less than 10 Orcas
swam past us; the largest in the front followed by several smaller and baby whales. I also saw
a white/grey whale
in that pod. We turned off the boat engines and watched as they headed north, probably to Port Hardy area. It was a breathtaking sight. Beautiful to see a healthy pod and babies. -Heather Bojsza

3 gray whales together in Port Susan

Next day pod heading south; that group included 1 good-size dorsal, 2 medium, and couple smaller. Maybe different pods. -Lynn Andrew

We had another sighting this morning at 7am in front of our house.
3 gray whales
traveling together, heading south, and spent quite a bit of time just inside the buoy line as they slowly moved down the beach. It appeared one of the 3 whales was smaller than the other two when it rolled up to breathe, and when its tail was exposed during a dive. Beautiful! -Dan Barrett

About

4:30
, I stepped out onto the deck, and again heard blows. Here came
2 gray whales back south
. I made a quick decision not to grab the camera or [binoculars] as I had a sandwich in hand. Bad decision! Just as the 2 grays came in front of the house, one of them did 3 breaches in a row!! [I've] never had a chance to see them breach before. You could hear the .......... of several different folks along the bluff, and on the beach. The whales then continued heading south, stopping to feed just north of Summerland. Went out onto the deck again about 7 PM. Could hear whale blows to the south, but never spotted them. The exposed tideflats show lots of activity!

14:00 -
Today was a Whale of a day. About 2 PM I was paddling my kayak down to Summerland, staying very close to shore in just a foot or so of water. I started hearing, and seeing the
blows from 2 gray whales feed out off the drop off
. Unfortunately, no camera as I had both hands on the paddle, so no ID, but the resonant sounds of their blows at water level were lovely, as was the sun glinting off the huge bodies as they rolled along, slowly heading north. One big blow, and one smaller blow. (Similar to Earhart? and Shackleton? a few days before.) I followed back north along the shore until they rounded the point at Mabana. -Barbara Brock

17:00
- Hello. We were so excited to have our first
Gray Whale
encounter yesterday! We went to
Polnell Point
to have lunch. After we dropped anchor, we heard a giant blow from off in the bay. The Gray we observed was at Polnell Point Between 430-5 pm. They were feeding near shore and at one point came over to our boat to check us out! We had our motor off the entire time and were at the proper distance (until the whale came to visit us). Some folks on shore did hear and come to see the whale, and every time the whale breathed/blew, the dog on the beach started barking excitedly. We felt grateful for the wonderful nature experience. Thank you for your work and dedication to this wonderful species! -Erica Montgomery & Andrew Power
