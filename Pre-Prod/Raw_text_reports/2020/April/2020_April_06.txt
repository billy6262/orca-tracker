Hello, we just saw a group of
9 or so orcas heading SE from South Pender through Boundary Pass
. Didn't look like there were any large males - though potentially a few sprouters. Travelling in a very tight group so hard to know exact numbers. Lovely start to the week..! Sorry I didn't get any pictures! From my perspective, it looked like they were heading mostly east ish towards Skipjack Island or East Point on Saturna, maybe? -Madison Duffin

I had just started to fix dinner the other night, when my friend Barbara calls: "Come quick, she says, I have 2 grays feeding below my house". WOW! Tom and I jumped into the car and headed down there. She lives in the
southern part on Camano
. We went straight to the beach and practiced social distancing. We were very close to home and we stayed safe. Just as we got there, my neighbor calls to report orcas in front of our house! Oh well, .... How lucky can one get! ....I'm glad we stayed with the grays. It was awesome to watch them feed from the beach. I have never seen that before. My husband [Thomas Trowbridge] shot this amazing video of
#21 Shackleton and #22 Earhart feeding together just off the Mabana beach

I only saw two, but other folks on the beach say there were three. It was a very, amazingly exciting day! I'm sorry to send you so many, I'm wanting to get enough identifying marks to ID them. They were taken on the 6th around 11 am and the sunset shots the same day at
7:30. (
Pebble Beach
, Camano). Thank you!

Entry 7:
19:08 -
I just saw a gray whale in the inside of
Deception Pass
. I saw him yesterday a few times too. Didn't get a picture but saw part of the body and the spray. The first day I saw him (Sunday) he was hanging out inside the pass but kind of
near Strawberry Island
. I think he went out the pass after like 20 minutes. It was the middle of the day. Yesterday (Monday) he was hanging out in the same spot for a while, maybe half an hour. I think he went out the pass again, too, yesterday evening. There's been significantly less boat traffic so we've seen way more animal activity than usual. A couple of boats looked at him for a while with their motors off on Sunday. I will try to get a picture next time! -Emily Gilbert
