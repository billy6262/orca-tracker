,
17:05. Swimming leisurely south, about 150 yards from shore. Looks like a smaller whale? It was definitely a humpback. Very sleek, dark back with a little dorsal fin, no spotting. Blow was also tall and straight. Sorry I couldn't snap a picture! -Anastasia Nicolov

Entry 3:
a gray hanging around Hood Canal
? We've seen it twice last week
between Bangor and Seabeck
. It went north last Thursday [
April 23rd] near Bangor and then my dad saw it heading South Sunday [
April 26th], though he wasn't 100 % sure. I hope it makes it. We've been wondering what it would be feeding on out here and a bit concerned with it going near the Bangor Sub base. -Hannah Klabo

Happy Hour and the whale returned today at
5:00pm, just north of us on
Pebble Beach
. We didn't see which direction he/she came from, probably north, but feeding went on for at least ten minutes before it continued back north towards Mabana.
