, and the matriarch,
T018

Entry 6:
14:45 -

15:00 -
We were walking to downtown from our home and spotted some water spouts in the Possession Sound when we were walking past the westside of the Rosehill Community Center, looking at the water. Type of whale: unsure, Direction of whale travel: North, When seen:

Entry 7:
2:45-3pm, Only saw one (could have been more but seemed like one). No noticeable markings or distinguishing fins. First time seeing a whale in this area. We didn't take any photos since we were up behind Arnie's parking lot in downtown Mukilteo. The whale (we assume) came up maybe 6 times over 30 minutes and we saw the water spouting up. It was heading north and went right between the ferry from Mukilteo to Whidbey. Hope this helps! We were very excited! We would love any insight or info about how/when/where to track them as we are new to the area. -Thanks, Cindy Auxier
