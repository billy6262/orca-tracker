Orca Sightings for April 30, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
17:58 - Transient orcas
on a kill out from
Constellation Park (south of Alki Point)
...Photos are crappy. Water was very choppy and they were beyond midchannel, and backlit. They were definitely on a kill for some time. I watched them at least an hour from Constellation. At least one male, but not full grown, fin seems sprouting still. A small one and one of the females had a very wide dorsal. They seemed to split up after eating.
Male was well beyond Blakely Rock and others seemed to head west
...
Had a grey whale here Tuesday
[28th] as well. -Kersti Muul -

Entry 2:
Haro Strait -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #25: "... The five whales were the
T75Bs and T75Cs
in a tight group traveling slowly north about fifty yards or so off the bluff. ..." See CWR Encounter #25 for photos and full encounter summary.

Entry 3:
orcas today, 3 pm, Haro Strait, just south of D'Arcy Island
. Probably about 4 of them. It was a shock! We were just cruising along and there they were! We saw a sea lion flipper in the midst too. My boyfriend was wondering if they were teaching a juvenile whale. He said he's never seen anything like that. We slowed down and kept our distance; they were very active. It was crazy to see them so active and playful, and possibly with that sea lion? Hunting? They were heading more north towards D'Arcy Island. We were heading back towards Sidney. Thanks! -Chelsea Kork

Entry 6:
Mid Saratoga Passage - ~

11:00-
13:00 and

18:00 - Watched 2 grays,
mid-day, too far out for really any good photos. They were out about 1/4 to 1/2 mile from here, traveling to
Greenbank side of Baby Island
and kind of hanging out mid triangle. This was around 11-1 or so. Then later, around 6 pm, Dubknuck ${"["}#44] decided to visit across the street. He may have been one of the 2 earlier. He was booking. He did not hang out but kept going south at a rapid pace, but not far out from shore. Once I lost sight across the street I hurriedly headed to Fox Spit and he was there right away!

18:00 - Gray whale below bluff, Baby Island Hts. Followed him to Fox Spit along the shore. He is now heading towards Langley at a fast clip. I think it's #44 Dubknuck. [confirmed -alb]

13:30 - Grays
now look like heading more northeast,
Whidbey side, mid channel
, across from Camano State Park.

11:00 - 2 grays outside of Baby Island headed south
a bit into Holmes Harbor.
