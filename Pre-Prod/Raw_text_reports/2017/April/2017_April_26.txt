Water was a little rough so difficult to take good pictures. Also, they were rather docile as they traveled through and were only breaking water with shallow surfacing. Their blows were even very peaceful and quiet. Still it is such an amazing treat to see them. Now we will get nothing accomplish again for a few more days as our eyes will be fixed on the water....-Gretchen Stewart
