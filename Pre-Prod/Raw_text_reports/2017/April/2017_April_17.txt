How many whales today? We thought
we counted 7
, and have ID photos for 5 of them. What an amazing day - at one point 3 passed us swimming together! It seemed like whales were everywhere. So happy to see
#44 Dubknuck
back in town, and thrilled to see
#723 Lucyfer
has finally shown up (confirmed by us today) - making TEN of our local "Sounders" who've been seen in and around Saratoga Passage this year. The others we ID'd were
#53 Little Patch
,
#56 (no name), and #383 (no name)
...-Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
*

1:50 p.m. - Gray whales 44, 56 AND 723 off Everett!!
-Renee Beitzel

12:55 p.m. -
Sweet News! Jill Hein aboard Mystic Sea confirms gray whale
#723 as the 10th North Puget Sound gray whale
inland this Spring! He is with
#44 and #56 off Hat/Gedney Island
and we are so happy! We have been wondering about 723... he was the first one confirmed inland last year 2016 but he didn't leave last May with the others. He had been seen many times through out the summer and fall around the San Juans and down in Puget Sound, but had not been seen this spring until today.

San Juan Channel - There was an unusual sighting today...
a gray whale in San Juan Channel
! We scooted out the door in a hurry to see him. Together we moved swiftly through
Cattle Pass
on the ebb and said good bye as he swam away toward Salmon Bank. -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
