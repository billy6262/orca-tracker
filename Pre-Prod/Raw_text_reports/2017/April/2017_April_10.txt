Orca Sightings for April 10, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
...a family of
Bigg's (transient) killer whales near Victoria
that have only been photographed on a few occasions in southeast Alaska.
These whales (currently unnamed) were traveling with the T068B group
and now that they have been seen in Canada will have ID names assigned to them. -Mark Malleson, Report by BC Killer Whale Research
*
Juan de Fuca Strait & Haro Strait - It is not very often that killer whales never before documented in the Salish Sea appear in the region. However, on
April 10th, Mark Malleson (a senior whale-watch skipper and whale researcher) photo-identified
a family of Bigg's (transient) killer whales near Victoria that have only been photographed on a few occasions in southeast Alaska.
These whales (currently unnamed) were
traveling with the T068B group
and now that they have been seen in Canada will have ID names assigned to them. -BC Killer Whale Research

There was a bit of wind, but there were
Bigg's (transient) Killer whales
too!! I saw a group I have not seen before and a group that doesn't visit very often. (But perhaps they might take notice of our abundance of prey and stick around!) ...When we first saw them they had made a kill and we're socializing in Swanson channel. Then after a while they powered up and went south west to
Morseby pass
. This was the 10th about

1:30-
2:30pm. The T68Bs plus others
. -Traci Walter

Around

8:30am a pod of 6-8 individuals headed east through the Strait toward Admiralty Inlet
, where they paused and turned around, appearing to be heading northwest. Then we lost sight of them (from North Beach, PT). -Annette Huenke & Sebastian Eggert, Port Townsend

At least
2 grays feeeding in Crescent Harbor
. There were three spots at one time. I was told by the neighbors that the had been there from about five pm. We stayed
until
7:15
, the whales were still in the harbor but had moved closer to the island. What a blessing to be able to see them from our home. -Terr Parham
