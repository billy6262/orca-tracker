Orca Sightings for April 12, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
8 orcas heading west through Boundary Pass tonight at 630
. This was taken near Tilly Point on
South Pender
. Just poking along slowly. -Madison Duffy
(
presumably the
T123s and T99s
. They were last seen around
5pm at Blunden Islet
, just SE of South Pender Island - ALB per SHS
)
*
We found
killer whales and a humpback whale
!! We had two killer whale families known as the
T123's and T099's.
The
humpback was one of our locals known as BCY0324 "Big Mama"
. (encounter location:
Boundary Pass
) -Ocean Ecoventures (Capt. Gary Sutton)

Unidentified killer whales -
9:55 a.m. -
ferry Kitsap reported a pod of
four orcas at the confluence of Thatcher Pass and Rosario Pass
, south of Blakely Is.,in the ferry lane. No direction of travel given.
*

5:30 p.m. - Two grey whales, traveling north off of McKees beach (Port Susan)
. Going slowly and feeding. Doing some spy hopping, and staying about one hundred feet from shore. Took about 45 minutes before they rounded the point at Kayak and swam out of sight. Just beautiful. The blows were definitely two different sizes and when they came up the size of back before rolling down were significantly differently different. One was more active than the other. When they came up for a spy hop at the same time one seemed larger than the other. Just delighted to see them. There was a quad copter drone over head. Way to close, about 100 feet overhead. And this is when they stopped eating to stick their heads out of the water. I was wondering if the sound from the drone could have been disturbing them. -Nanci Bondelid Green

5:00 p.m. - Gray whale sighting. We just watched a gray whale in shallow water in Skagit Bay
, moving slowly from east to west as the tide moved out, possibly 'grazing'. Pretty exciting, as I didn't expect to see whales in such shallow water. Whale appeared to be lunging and feeding while traveling slowly back out of Skagit Bay as the tide came in. -Rose Orr

3:50 p.m. - One gray whale close to Camano shore at Pebble Beach
, heading north. -Sarah Malstead

2:19 p.m. - Now heading east towards Spi-Be Dah.

at least one gray whale (Looked like two, couldn't id with the distance) off Langley
