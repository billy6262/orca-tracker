9:10 a.m. -
My husband, daughter and I think we saw
a humpback whale this morning swim by our beach at Fox Spit
. It was headed east/south but we never saw it come up again. This was at
9:10. -Ann Brockenbrough

Blustery weather did not deter hardy passengers after Mystic Sea left the dock to head north and 'welcome the whales' on Langley's official ' Welcome the Whales' day. P
atch (#49) was spotted first near Elger Bay, Camano Island
, celebrating yet another year's return, accompanied by traveling companion
#383
. We observed some lunge feeding with the whales raising their massive heads among the white-caps before sailing south to catch up with two more of the resident grays,
#53 (Little Patch) and #21,
equally intent on feeding closer to shore. Every year we marvel that nature brings these impressive giants to our shores to share the secret ghost-shrimp bounty known only to them. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

10:35 a.m. - Grays: reported 3 spotted due NW of Langley
, south end of Camano Island. -Carol Knight Unidentified whales -
Juan de Fuca Strait -
10:00 a.m.
This morning, on a rising tide, we saw
two small whales
- (reported as: Minke, perhaps) within forty yards of shore, of of Bullman Beach, near Neah Bay. They both held their positions relative to the shore, they might have been feeding. The water isn't very deep where they were sighted. We really couldn't identify a color, per se, as most of the surfacings were quite quick, though no dorsal of any kind could be seen. So, I'll be calling them immature Grays. (...my girlfriend and I manage The Bullman Beach Inn, and we are excited about the natural possibilities of the area. I posted another sighting - small whales again, Gray, with a pod of at least five Orca only about 200 yards from them. Exciting viewing from our front lawn) -Scott Hartman
