============================================================

Entry 1:
11:28 p.m. - still chattering
. -Sara Frey
*

10:05-
10:45 p.m. -
tuned in and hearing
Transient calls
right away. Listened for about 40 minutes, calls intermittently faint and loud. -Alisa Lemire brooks
*

10:00 p.m. - hearing orcas faintly on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. -Ursula Renteria
*
We left the
T36A's, T99's and T49As just off the Patos light milling, socializing and vocalizing non stop at
6:30pm
. It was epic! The 36's and 99's had been there for a couple hours before the 49A's joined. And the party continued probably long after we left... -Barbara Howitt

9:00 a.m. -
WS Ferries reports
4 orcas off the Orcas Island ferry dock heading west
.
*

8:30 a.m. - They are 4-5 orcas passing by right now through Harney Channel
. One large male, one juvenile male and 2 females and one young one. A large yacht plowed right through the pod seemingly without ever seeing them or slowing down. They seemed to come back up through the boats wake just fine, I think. Possible transients? They seemed busy milling around for a few minutes before disappearing (this group was westbound). -Cheers, Mariann Carrasco

Unidentified Orca sighting - Western Juan de Fuca- Bullman Beach/south of Neah Bay @

4:30 -
4:45 P.M.
I spotted a pod (At least five; one male) about 400 yards off of Bullman Beach. Fishing boats had been fishing in the area earlier in the day. There is a reef and drop off about 300 yards off of the beach and these were just beyond it; this was also the area the fishing boats had been working in the morning. First became aware of them when one jumped, clearing the water, landing on his back/side. The rest of the pod were in the area and they held position for some time, ten minutes or so, before heading east, remaining within 1/2 mile of shore. I continued to watch them move slowly south, though they would stop at times, seemingly "working" an area before continuing east. -Scott Hartman

10:00 a.m. -
Janet Bartlow called again from
Chito Beach
(Strait of Juan de Fuca, 50 miles NW of Port Angeles) to report
6 orca heading west
, splashing and tail lobbing, several miles out from shore.
*

10:30 a.m. - Discovery Bay/Eastern Juan de Fuca
- A small pod fed right off
Beckett Point, west of Port Townsend
. The most amazing thing I've ever seen. I cried. I am grateful! I have videos of it, little ones breaching all the way out! My best guess was around 5 or 8 whales. It was hard to tell and I was pretty excited. There was one male in the group with the larger dorsal fin. They came in to the point where I am working and left heading north back toward Protection Island. -Spencer Clanin,

Entry 2:
*
Approx.

8:30 pm (4/18) a humpback surfaced slightly to the south of me, heading S into Eld Inlet
. No photo. It surfaced 2 more times after long down times.
Last seen near Flap Jack Point. At

10:30
- when it was silent and flat calm - I heard it surface to the south of me, as it was heading N out of Eld Inlet. Saw its back on the next surface near Cooper Point. It surfaced one more time heading north - toward Dana Passage. -Kim Merman
*
(Humpback) swam past Toy Point on Fox Island headed south around 2pm
... it happened to quickly...I heard his blow and looked out in time to see his tail flip at me. A breath later he was a good 1/2 mile or more away. -Glenn Hansen
