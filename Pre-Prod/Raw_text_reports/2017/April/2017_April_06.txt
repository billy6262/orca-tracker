Orca Sightings for April 6, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Biggs killer whales (Transients)
So after going through ID's and photos for a few hours this is what i have from the encounter... Looks like we had
20 animals in the afternoon including the 011's 036's 086A's 099's 123's and 124A's.
Makes more sense now with the amount of animals we were seeing during the encounters. Until I was able to see the pics on computer was I able to see the 124A's and others. I had 2 encounters, AM from 1100-1300 hrs and PM 1700-1900 hrs. During this time the orcas stayed in the area of the Willaby Shoals (near Campbell River) within 3 miles of GPS mark 50
