Once again
Patch (#49) and Little Patch (#53)
delighted passengers on both trips as the duo headed south from
Camano Head towards Hat Island
, their synchronized exhalations carrying on the breeze to give everyone on deck a whiff of pure whale breath! Barking California sea-lions rafting near Baby Island were a source of fascination as they glided by on the current, and their playful antics made the day for the kiddies on board. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

Spotted this
whale at Cape Flattery this past Sunday at
1:05pm.
Is it a Gray? Looks like the fluke of a gray, but I'm a total novice so appreciate any help. While we were standing on the
western edge at Cape Flattery
, this one swam by right underneath us. As we were facing north, we only saw it for about 5 seconds before it submerged. We never saw it surface again. Unfortunately I only had time to raise my camera and snap one photo before it was gone. It never did completely break the surface....It was hugging the coast at CF and appeared to be heading into the Strait of Juan De Fuca. Thanks much for your response. We moved out here from Colorado a couple of years ago. Trying to learn all we can about these magnificent creatures. Always a delight when we see whales from land. And, to see this one so close to the shore was very special! -Russ Stamp
