Discovery Passage - Transient Killer Whale Predation Event: T023'S T011 T011A DALLS PORPOISE KILL
. The event took place on

Entry 2:
Discovery Passage by Steep Island
(near Campbell River). Still going through everything for positive identification but for sure had
T011 and T011A Wakana and Rainy
again. Loner male
T124c
had joined them, along with the
T023's
known as the Motley Crew by researchers on the West Coast of VI. This gang experienced 4 deaths in 7 years, but is bouncing back. Encounter started as most do. Whales were idling along at approx. 5 knots Northwest bound. within 10 min of being on scene the dinner bell rang. They had been spread out in a line formation and all of a sudden two females initiated the hunt with first a fast leap across the bow, then all of a sudden 40 seconds in a HUGE dolphin like jump to cut off the porpoise as it was making its way to my hull. Thats the one frame thats in the posted photos. One of the off contrast ones.
The hunt itself lasted approx. 25 minutes, with the food sharing portion taking up another 30 min.
Once they finished everyone was on their way northwest bound again.
Next morning
April 12th there was a sighting of 10 plus Orcas Westing in front of Kelsey Bay @0730
. Of note during the encounter I did not see T124C T011 or T011A actually participate in the hunting action. They were on the outside with tail slaps and things it seemed. They were in the middle of some of the foraging after as far as i could tell. -Nick Templeman

4:00 p.m. - Dall's Porpoise Pod Approximatley 7-8, Guemes Island
. While windsurfing past the southern tip of Guemes Island toward Hat Island, a pod of Dall's Porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were spread apart and then coalesced together. They are less interactive with humans it would seem than Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, and with their cute tiny dorsal fins, they are less easy to spot. Feeding. -Mark Reid
