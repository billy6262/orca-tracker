Orca Sightings for April 22, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juans - 2017 Earth Day Sail with the T124As - a total of 8 transient orcas
. It was exciting for us to meet
the two new calves, T124A6 and T124A2B
, first seen on
December 30, 2016. (Note the differences in eye patches). We met the whales in
Harney Channel traveling between Shaw and Orcas Island
in a tight group aiming for the sun. They decided to head north through Pole Pass, turned south of Yellow Island, then north again to see the sunset at Jones Island before
heading for President's Channel

YOU NEVER KNOW!
T063 - "CHAINSAW" off Sooke
today! What an amazing encounter...We were cruising out west of Sooke near the traffic lanes in some light rain and out of the corner of my squinting eyes I thought I had a glance of a small dorsal a 1/2 km off our starboard...Never second guessing myself I stopped and was excited to find
his mom T065 (I believe)
and knew that there had to be more around...We had the pleasure to be the only vessel around visiting these special Transient Killer Whales! Then off to Race Rocks Light House to visit some Sea Lions, Bald Eagles and our local Sea Otter....Another great day to be on the water! -Paul Pudwell
