. -Pat Karman

Entry 6:
Puget Sound
- Who doesn't love a good breach shot, or a spyhop?! Not one person will tell you they don't. In fact I LOVE spyhops. BUT, I think what I love even more than either of those is when a
killer whale
surfaces right next to the boat and the water is flat calm. Conditions need to be right for it to work, but I think this mini series shows what I mean. Seeing them underwater and then gliding to the surface to take a breath is a complete moment of zen for me. Lucky for me, my subject,
T36B1
and the water around him/her were very cooperative. -Renee Beitzel

3:30pm
