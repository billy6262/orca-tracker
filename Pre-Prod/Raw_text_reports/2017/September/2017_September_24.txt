Orca Sightings for September 24, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Sunday morning we ventured out on J1 for one of our special all-day tours with a fantastic group of passengers. What we normally see in three or four trips we saw in just eight mere hours! At the end we were all (crew included) a boat full of smiles and amazement. We watched the
Southern Residents almost go through Active Pass (twice),
a huge group of B
igg's Orcas almost go through Active Pass
(once), we saw the Southern Resident orcas engaged in stunning social behavior, breaching
Humpback
whales, lots of wildlife, and gorgeous scenery. Each of our all day tours is uniquely different and we never know what we will see when we leave the dock. -Maya's WW

Entry 6:
reported as Fin whale. Based on size, description, further discussion, and reports of other minke in the area that day (and that we've had no other reports of a Fin whale inland this year) it is
presumed to be a minke

6:30 p.m. -
We saw a single Fin
whale heading NNW out between Fort Casey and Port Townsend
at approximately 1830. Traveling. 48°08'56.3"N 122°42'23.4"W.
You are probably right that it was most likely a minke. I was looking through binoculars and I estimated that once if broke the surface there was about 12-16 feet between the front (not the head, just looked like the top of the whales back) and the fin. It then looked like another 4 to 6 feet until the body was under water (from the fin). So I guess that the part of the whale above the surface was somewhere between 16 to 22 feet long. I did not see a head or a tail. Both were under water. I saw it break the surface about 10 or 12 times over a 5 minute period. When I returned home, I looked up pictures on the internet to try to find one that looked like...the picture I found was of a fin whale but what I am not experienced at all so it very well may have been a minke. -Michael Colquhoun
