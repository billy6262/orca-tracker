Orca Sightings for September 8, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
I've only ever seen something like this once before, and it was in Monterey Bay, California in 2014. But as we got on scene last night it was almost a flashback to that Sunday morning when I'd watched a group of nearly 30 California transient killer whales take down a gray whale calf. It was different whales, a different place, different prey, but the scale was the same. The smell, the sounds, the mood. We could see the slick before we had reached the whales. It was huge, stretching for over a mile and you could trace it's path through the waves to where the whales were actively feeding. It was two families we know well---the
T65As and the T99s
. Two excellent moms, two excellent hunters.
The gulls had gathered by the hundreds and they hovered over the whales, even when we couldn't see them, waiting for any scrap they could snatch up. We saw some with pieces of blubber, squabbling with the others as they tried to steal it. The whales didn't notice them, they were too busy feasting and playing. The youngsters rolled in the waves, pec slapping and tail lobbing. Sometimes even launching themselves in a half breach between long dives.
The passengers on board were hearty souls, braving the rolling seas for glimpses of something rarely seen here in these inland waters. Their own observations sparked questions: Do they eat it all? How long will it take them? What was it? How did they kill it? I explained their tactics in hypotheticals, we didn't witness it after all. I told them what parts they seem to prefer, generally of course, we've never witnessed these particular families taking a whale down before. I assured them that even though the whales wouldn't eat it all, nothing would go to waste.
In all the time we spent with them they didn't move. We left them where we found them, still feeding. It was incredible to witness, even just the aftermath of what must have been an epic hunt, and I feel a great privilege in having been there to see it in the first place. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

September 8 - Admiralty Inlet - We headed north today around Blakely Island, through Peavine Pass, scouting in the very foggy conditions for whales. The fog persisted as we headed out Cattle Pass, with a brief stop at Whale Rocks to check on the Steller sea lions. Continuing southward, we eventually received a report of
whales by the Port Townsend ferry
! Off we traveled and it was well worth it - Transient/Biggs killer whales - the
T28s
- rarely seen in the Salish Sea were off Admiralty Head, and heard whispers that the T124s were with them! Good to see these whales, lots of tail slaps and some great looks at them. It was a 100 mile round trip today - but well worth the long trip! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

I told Moby (their dog) the whales were coming, and he spent the next hour on his 'whale rock' we call it on point waiting to let us know when they were here. This guy is in doggy heaven here, loves the whales! So literally less than 5 minutes before these
Ts
swam by, two large males together close to shore on the Kitsap side, and several females paralleling them 1 mile across tight to Vashon, I see this guy (again) snoozing on my boat. (here was a seal on the stern of Tim's anchored sailboat) But he went into the water just minutes before they came by. I thought we were going to witness some activity, kind of hoped for it as this juvenile delinquent testosterone rich seal has been very aggressive making me paddle him off the boat when I row out to sail. Then he takes over my dingy until I get back, seemingly waiting for his big boat! And then these guys popped up right in front of the house...God I love living here!...-Tim Ferris
*
Friday evening I was alone on the beach and got a chance to see Transient orcas (
T101's, T36B's, T36, T37A) pass by Cove on Vashon Island
. The sun was going down, the water was flat, still, and all I could hear was the sound of orcas surfacing and breathing before they disappeared under the water again. Catching orcas twice in one week, hope there is more to come this season. -Photo by Kelly Burns Keenan,
