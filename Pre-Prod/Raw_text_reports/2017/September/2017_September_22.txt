Entry 2:
- Haro Strait
- With the welcome return of some members of
L-pod
from the endangered Southern Resident community and perfect weather conditions, we were privileged to observe these charismatic whales foraging and socializing in their natural habitat west of
Salmon Bank
, off San Juan Island. The orcas were well spread out hunting for salmon, while a couple of the younger ones played nearby. Our return trip took us past Whale Rocks where growling Steller sea lions basked in the September sunshine, and on to Burrows Island Lighthouse. Summer may be coming to an end, but it's not over yet. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
