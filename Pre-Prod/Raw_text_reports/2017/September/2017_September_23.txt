4:22 p.m. - Lime Kiln hydrophone:
begin hearing echolocation followed by loud vocals. I listened
until
5:00 pm
until I could hear just faint whispers of their calls as they moved further away from the hydrophones. During the 40 minutes of listening I heard
a lot echolocation with S1, S4 calls
for sure and what sounded to me like
S7, S10 and S40 calls

Lots of surface activity!! Still South and East though. Very spread out South and in shore. (from Granny's Cove,

September 23: On a day of beautiful fall sunshine and flat calm water, we headed out toward Lummi Island and caught up to a very large group (possibly at least 40!) of our Southern Resident orcas!!! What a treat to see them after such a long absence from their home waters.
We found them just at Towhead Island
, on the north side of Cypress Island, with multiple groups spread out across the water. Seeing very large
J26, Mike
, breaching and tail slapping, was awesome! We also got a good look at some of
L pod
, and a few of the approximately 2 year old calves of J and L pods. They continued south down Rosario Strait, grouping up at times, then spreading out again. We stopped to see harbor seals, a Steller sea lion, and many birds at Bird Rocks. After reluctantly leaving the whales at Colville Island, we took a scenic tour around the small islands close to Lopez Island, then under the Deception Pass bridge. -Bonnie Gretz, Volunteer Naturalist
