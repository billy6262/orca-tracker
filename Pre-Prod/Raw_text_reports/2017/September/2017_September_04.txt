Orca Sightings for September 4, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Taken from
Lime Kiln, west side San Juan Island. Lots of whales
back and forth for hours. Night came, and there was the orange moon. It was dead quiet and calm, the only sounds to fill the air were crickets and the blows of several orca. They didn't come super close to shore but it was amazing to spend hours in their presence. And did I mention an incredible sunset too? So glad to have the residents back, hope they stay! -Photo by Rachel Haight,

They're back! See Center for Whale Research Encounter #73 Sept 4 for full report and photos: For several weeks there have been reports of whales coming in off Jordan River in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and whale watch boats have been dutifully going west from Victoria to hopefully encounter incoming residents. But, each time it has turned out that the whales that are found are Bigg's Transient killer whales, and we now have a record number of sightings and encounters of this ecotype in Salish Sea waters. Today, however, Mark Malleson was able to confirm that
incoming whales he encountered west of Sheringham lighthouse at 1030 AM were RESIDENTS!!
We decided to launch in two waves, with "Shachi" leaving Snug Harbor at 1128 as the whales were reported to be nearing Otter Point, and "Orcinus" departing a couple of hours later if the whales came in as far as Victoria. "Shachi" encountered the lead group of whales at 1310 just east of Secretary Island, and the first whale identified was J19, who seems to have taken over as leader after the passing of J2 in the winter of 2015/16.

Today we welcomed back our Southern Residents after an extended absence from the Salish Sea. Wherever they were I hope they were finding enough to eat and I'm so happy to see them. Here is a spyhop from
Slick (J16) alongside her daughter, Scarlet (J50)
. Sunset was stunning, and better yet it was spent in the company of
members of J, K, and L pods. Here's Matia (L77)
and a friend under a swiftly setting sun. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

Tim and I went out on our own boat today and got word as we were leaving the dock that there was a breaching
humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" at Apple Tree Cove
near Kingston! We joined Chilkat and watched Two Spot surface and dive a few times. Eventually Chilkat and all the other boats around left, as they were leaving Two Spot surfaced right in front of our idle boat!! She then circled us slowly, checking us out, she stayed right under the surface and kept circling, then she went under the boat and came up next to us again! Then she fluked...-Janine Harles
