San Juans - There were
transient killer whales in a dozen different locations around the Salish Sea today, totaling more than 60 whales.
I was lucky enough to see the T
65As and T100s
this afternoon in northern Haro Strait, and then the T36Bs and T99s this evening. Here's a shot from tonight near sunset as the
36Bs and 99s
rounded the point at the Cattle Point Lighthouse to head up San Juan Channel at dusk. The "back side" (aka north side) of
Spieden Island
is always a perfect setting for those backlit blows. This shot is from
September 2nd, when we were there with the
T65As
. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Hi ON, we saw
T65As and T100s around
15:00 9/2 near Spieden Island
. The groups split with T65As heading east and T100s I believe going north. Observed T65As circle Gull Rock 3x, then passed Flattop Rock & kept heading east. Appeared to be possible foraging activity but not confirmed. We left
T65As around
17:00
.
Earlier 9/2 around

13:00 in Moresby passage
(Canada) we saw
T36As
actively hunt a harbor porpoise. Sorry porpoise, but it was spectacular! I didn't personally ID - going on what nearby WW naturalists said. There was some confusion about who was who b/t the 100s & 65As... but you're right, it was a wonder day with Ts. The earlier group in Canada was especially active- tons of leaps, tail-slaps, spy hops, etc. ( Ok, confirmed it was the T36As in the
13:00 Moresby group - though we saw 5 animals, not 4. Suspect T37A might have been traveling with the T36As as the transient guide says she will sometimes do - her fin seems to match what I saw but not sure). -Michelle Leann

September 2 - Admiralty Inlet - Yet another beautiful day with orcas reported in 3 different directions - hmmm - Capt. Eric chose
Admiralty Inlet
(west side of Whidbey Isl.) and we found the
T046Bs
who were maneuvering through the really strong riptide currents at the
north end of Marrowstone Island
. The tides pushed us in many directions, and it was exciting to watch the whales also maneuver these strong currents. We had good looks at the T046Bs, before heading homeward passing Partridge buoy with Sea Lions, and Minor Island with many harbor seals. Another outstanding trip aboard the Mystic Sea!

2:00 p.m. - 7 or more Transients in Admiralty passing Fort Flagler
(north end Marrowstone Island) northbound. Tentatively ID'd as T46Bs (& possibly some T37s) -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
