just after she hung up with Howard. -Melinda Barajas

have turned eastward toward
Possession Point
...we thought they were a 'couple hundred yards' from shore at PNP this morning. It was one of our more beautiful orca sightings with at least one breach, a couple leaps (do orcas leap?), and the glistening black and white very visible just with the naked eye. The porpoises, a sea lion, and a seal were all right in the same vicinity. -Called in by Marilyn Deroy
