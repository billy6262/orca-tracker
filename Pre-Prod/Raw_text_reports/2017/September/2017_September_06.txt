Orca Sightings for September 6, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave was working at home when John Durban called mid-morning to say the drone photogrammetry team had found southern residents heading our way off Blunden Island in Boundary Pass. Dave and his sister Sally grabbed their stuff and met Erin down at Snug Harbor. Ken had also got the whale report and he and Gail got off the dock and on scene with the whales first in "Shachi". "Orcinus" left a little while later and got on scene a
mile or so southwest of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island at about 1100
. The first whales the crew in "Orcinus" saw were the
J19s, L77s, J39, and L85
. These whales were loosely spread in small groups and singles and were traveling south at a high rate of speed....Full encounter report & photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 74.

After spending a day up in the Strait of Georgia, the
Southern Residents made their way back down Haro Strait this afternoon
. I can't describe how good it feels to see all those familiar dorsal fins again! Here's

Entry 2:
*
I first tuned in to
Lime Kiln hydrophone starting at
11:57 a.m and was hearing J calls, S1s and maybe S3s
, wide variety at times, but was having hard time IDing the calls while listening. Was hearing Ls too... hearing
S2iii calls suggesting L12 subgroup
. Echolocation followed and by

12:31 calls were amped up in volume
. I could see whales on the web too heading south. At 1

2:38 I switched over to Orcasound hydrophone and was hearing medium loud calls there. Js and Ls; S2 and S37? calls.
Lots of echolocation. At
12:44 pm I switched back over to Lime Kiln again but there was loud boat noise so I went right back to OS and am hearing Ks as well in quiet seas.

12:51 I'm back on LK where calls are loud,
boisterous and plenty along with much echolocation. By

1:12 still audible
but getting distant; I can hear they are moving away from the Lighthouse...that and can see them on the webam moving south through pleasure boats stopped in their path south of the light. Such a gift this beautiful hour plus listening to Js, Ks, & Ls off the west side! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

T137s, T36, T36Bs, and T37A1
after visiting Polly, mom and I hit up
Owen Beach Point Defiance Park
, they were last reported nearing Commencement Bay from Dash and Browns Point. We then headed to Les Davis Fishing Pier, I could see them near the port of Tacoma in Commencement Bay. About after 10 minutes, a second group popped up right out from the pier from me...from who knows where, it was great. My photos start with them...they headed and grouped up with the ones in the bay. Drove down to C.I. Shenanagins and watched them leave the bay and come back our way not too far out from shore. They were so active and playful. I think they had found lots of food. ... I know they have been ID'd by the experts as the T137s, T36, T36Bs and T37A1. Multiple breaches and many tailslaps.
