Entry 5:
9:00 a.m. - 4-6 Common dolphins in South Puget Sound
. They are traveling back and forth near the
mouth of Budd Inlet/Boston Harbor Marina
. Water is like glass. I can see them from across the bay. They are in the shadowed area near shore. The lighting is just right that I can actually see them exhale! Then as they surface, the sunlight glistens off their backs as they glide through the water. And without much fanfare, they explode into the air, creating the eruption of sunlit splashes. -Kim Merriman
