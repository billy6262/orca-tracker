Unidentified killer whales - Orca Sighting: Three traveling, 49°26'55.5"N 124°07'52.1"W (
SE of Lasqueti Island
). The time was about
0815hrs
on
September 21st. I was heading due south and they crossed in front of me port to starboard (heading westward). Sorry I did not identify saddle patches. I was more concerned about putting my boat in neutrals and staying away from them. One had a very large fin (probably male). Three in total, one youngster. -Chris Price

Entry 8:
Again, reported as Fin but through further discussion she settled on
probably a Minke
-ALB
) Just on the
tip of South Whidbey
and spotted a Fin whale. We were aware of the humpback in the vicinity. The whale only surfaced. There wasn't any breaching. Any pectoral slapping. We have had many experiences in MX with humpbacks. This animal did not appear to be a humpback. It could've been a minke. It was slender in size, dark grey, if I had to guess probably 12' long. It wasn't what struck me as a larger whale. When I look at fin whales, it did resemble the body shape, but the whale never did a full breach so we couldn't see underneath. When I look at the minke whale, the dorsal fin did resemble that as well. The dorsal fin was way more towards the rear of the whales body. Hope that helps. My husband is convinced it was a fin whale but it did look like it could be a minke as well. Were there any other reports of any other whales aside from the humpback? ...All good info. Probably not a fin whale then at that size. Probably a minke. My best guess. -Niboreel Sreyas
