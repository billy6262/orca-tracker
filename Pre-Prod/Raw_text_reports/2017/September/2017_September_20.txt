Orca Sightings for September 20, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Georgia Strait - We caught up with them around
1pm just off of Ladner at Vancouver, BC
...porpoising at a heavy speed....we were there between 1-2pm...The seas were heavy and the wind quite strong...they were heading north at a fast speed....I have to look at my photos to know them all, there were so many and I probably didn't get photos of all their saddles, but I do know that I saw
L41, L94, L90 and J47
for sure. I'm waiting for Tyson's report to confirm. we caught up with them just off the Ladner area. In the Strait of Georgia....they were heading north at that time. -Kristina Trowbridge

I heard
J and L
(I'm assuming from yesterday's posts) on the
Hydrophone around
3:15 am
last night. I sometimes sleep with it on and they woke me up. -Rachel Krauss Burrows

4:00 a.m. -
Now listening to the
pod at the Orcasound hydrophone
. Vocals and echolocation.

3:10 a.m. - Waking to orca at Lime kiln at 310 am
, priceless. Vocals and echolocation. -Terri Barnett

Southern Resident Killer Whales were heard last night at Lime Kiln (at
3:12 a.m.) and then at Orcasound Lab (5 km north of Lime Kiln) at
3:48.
This is a great example of how having multiple hydrophone locations can help infer the direction in which animals are moving -- in this case north through Haro Strait. -Scott Veirs

My FAVORITES! With a report from John Chau of some
Orca off Sooke
this morning I was ecstatic to find
T011 & T11A

Entry 3:
10 humpbacks (min) in the Strait of Juan de Fuca at
2:00 pm
, roughly 1/2 way between
Neah Bay and Port Angeles
at 48 deg 14' 58" N 124 02' 05" W. We were delivering a boat from Westport, and notice two whales ahead in our path and dropped to idle out of gear for them to pass. Those two were milling about near mid channel of the US side of the strait, close to the position above (probably 300 yards distant) as we floated we saw a total of six confirmed possible more whales heading west closer to shore on the US side, (probably 1/2 to 3/4 mile distant and an additional two milling behind us also roughly mid channel on the US side approximately 500 yards distant. Once the group had passed we continued to Anacortes. -Steve Marczewski
