September 12 - Today I found a little flyer in the marine office in falls creek with the information that you are looking for info about orca spotting. I was sailing towards
Gambier Island
with a friend of mine and we saw two orcas on the way -
between Horseshoe Bay and Bowen Island. Vancouver.
That was around

6:00 /
7:00 pm
I would guess. Not sure if this info is detailed enough for you but I thought it's better than nothing. Attached I send you some pics of the whales.
