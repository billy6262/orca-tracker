Orca Sightings for January 27, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
- Strait of Juan de Fuca
Went out today in search of wildlife around
Sooke
waters...It was a great encounter with the
J16's, including J42 and others
of our endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales (heading eastbound) and a male Elephant Seal around Race Rocks Lighthouse! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW
*
"...As the sun came out and made spotting easier we continued back
south of Race Rocks
. Mark spotted a blow and a dorsal fin which turned out to be
J16
. She was travelling with
J42 & J50
. They were foraging and hard to track..." (

4:20 pm -
call from Connie Barrett, Camano Island, husband saw
5 killer whales in Saratoga Passage heading north
. Two were near the Whidbey side (Greenbank area) and 3 were off Cama State Park, Camano Island.
*
The
T085's celebrating after a seal kill in Haro Strait near Kelp Reef
. "... Dave arrived, aboard "Orcinus", to the scene of the T85s just starting their seal kill as described above by Mark and Hanna at about 1420. T85C was the breacher and he appears to be another male. After Mark and Hanna left at
1455
, the T85s traveled slowly north in a tight group past the east entrance
to Hughes Passage
. They spread out briefly before coming back together. At about
1530
, the whales milled some and gulls began diving on the spot again. The whales had probably been carrying a part of a seal as it did not look like another kill. T85C and T85D dropped back and appeared to feed on a dropped piece of seal while
T85, T85A, and T85B
took a brief nap. T85C and T85D soon caught back up and the group continued traveling north until they turned northwest into Minors Channel. Dave left the T85s at 1601 still traveling northwest in Miners Channel between the northwest side of Sydney Island and Mandarte Island." (

I came across a group of about 5 dolphins today while cruising around Olympia from Steamboat Island to the South end of Anderson Island. I started filming as soon as I spotted them; next thing I knew they were playing in my wake!! -Trevor Lake
