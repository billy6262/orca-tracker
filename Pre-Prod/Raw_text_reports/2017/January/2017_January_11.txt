Orca Sightings for January 11, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Barkely Sound
sighting - sent by Gary Jones, Kildonan B.C. Photos below by John Adams. ID notes by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "The male looks like it could be
T2C1
. I can't say for sure that the others are the rest of the T2Cs but the eyepatch is about right for T2C3 in the rear. IF that is T2C on the far side, she has a new calf. Hopefully they turn up again soon! Cheers, Dave"
