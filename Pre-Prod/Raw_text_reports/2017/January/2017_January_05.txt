Orca Sightings for January 5, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - Encountered my first orcas of 2017 today! Ts, Ts and more Ts!
T11s, T41s, and T109s off Port Renfrew (western Juan de Fuca). At least the T124As and T86As in Haro Strait at sunset. The T124Ds were there too!

January 5, a small group,
(I believe 3) of transients swam by Moses point and down Satellite Channel
(top of Saanich Peninsula, BC). There was a bull, an adult female and maybe a juvenile. In the photos attached, the bull is in the rear and the smallest is in the front. What appears to be the adult female is close by the big male. They were probably hunting harbour seals in Saanich Inlet. (
ID notes by Dave Ellifrit, CWR: "I'm pretty sure the male is T60C
) -Regards, Guy Drake
