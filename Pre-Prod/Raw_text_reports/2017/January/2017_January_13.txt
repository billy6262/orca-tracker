Orca Sightings for January 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
At least three boats from Des Moines Yacht Club report seeing the
humpback whale
on Friday, 1/13. that has been in Puget Sound. They saw it off
Owens Beach (Pt Defiance).
It was floating in the water, not moving. They thought it was a log until it spouted at raised it's fluke. I asked around no photos. They were startled because they thought it was a log. One of our members was negotiating logs through the area and had the "log" off their port side with shore on the same side. He was in a 65 foot boat. Couldn't stop or veer away at that point. It was about 5 feet off his boat when he was startled to see the "log" blowing. We all assumed it was the same whale that was in the area last weekend. -Peggy Claar

5:00 p.m. - Humpback sighted at point defiance
: Saw a humpback
two nights in a row around 5 pm from the bluffs at the Gig Harbor Overlook on the north side of Point Defiance in Tacoma
. Looked to be heading east on Thursday 1/12 and west on Friday 1/13. Breached right in front of me on 1/13. Both times lingered in the area maybe 10-15 minutes then moved on. It breached. It was in an area where many harbor seals gather nightly at dusk and sea lions pass by. Perhaps there is food around? -Eve Pugsley
