Orca Sightings for January 30, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
J26
spyhop. We left J
's spread out moving west out the Juan de Fuca
this
afternoon
. They came south through
Oak Bay
single file in the
morning
. At approximately

9:00
I received a call from George Hamilton who had a large group of whales moving past his house just north of Ten Mile Point. I told him to send me some pictures to confirm whether they were SRKW's or T's. I suspected
J's/L87
from the description. Sure enough they were. I watched them from the apartment come around
10 mile Point
and proceed single file through Oak Bay. On the way to town I drove along the waterfront to watch them from shore. They went past the golf course and then swung south of Trial. I watched them porpoising for a short while on a line for Constance Bank before I left to get the boat. At 1045 I came across the first whale L87 who appeared to be the furthest north of the group close to the Victor Hotel buoy. The whales were very spread out and doing fairly long dives. They continued past William Head and I assumed they would go through Race Passage but
they swung east and south of Race Rocks
and continued west. I left them at
1245 slightly west of Race Rocks
.
