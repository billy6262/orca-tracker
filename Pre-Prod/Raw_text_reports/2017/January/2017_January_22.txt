I had a very good day! ...today the tide was to far in so we decided to go for a drive...My Husband dropped me off at
Dalco Viewpoint @

3:00-
4:30
I saw him/her about 200-300 yards moving back and forth... at one point it was right under me (I walked on the trail a little to a different overlook) Lots of people looking for it too. -Desiree Sauve

From

2:00-
5:00 p.m. - Medium sized whale off of Point Defiance
came up to our boat about 25 feet long... -Betty Cormier

2:35 p.m. -
Speckles!
Dalco
, near to shore, now. Milling about, no particular direction...You can't see the tail markings here (just the boat right near him/her) but I was able to see the whale's tail fluke when he/she dove and it definitely had speckled markings. It was definitely a humpback. I couldn't gauge its size too well but it didn't appear especially small, despite reports of Speckles being little. -Lissa Brod Anderson
