1819 -
Lots of
percussives
were still visible when it got too dark to see dorsals... I was wondering if they're finally having a superpod. Even though it was hard to see what all was going on it just had the aura of a superpod, with all the crazy splashing in every direction. At one point there was a triple breach - too bad it was 4-5 miles away!
1750 - They are all SB now
. I've seen at least 25 whales but I'm sure there are more - poor vis with white caps and rain.
1745 - Far off ones were going north
, now some maybe a mile out going south.
1738 - The only ones I see are at least a couple miles offshore
.
1730 - Just got to Land Bank they are breaching like crazy
offshore. They're also doing lots of weird surface activity making huge splashes with their tails, it's very bizarre
1708 - Sounding more like regular Js
now, and getting a little louder. Actually sounded like
Js and Ks
.
1707 - they do sound bizarre!

6:09 p.m. -
The whales are a good distance from shore, maybe 4 miles...slowly going up, at the moment. I am hearing calls of all three pods, but they are too far offshore to know exactly who and now it's too dark.
Lots of K (kitten) call but the L54s
make that call too. Hearing also the L pod Up-Tick (
S19
) and
lots of J calls
too. Fun to think that maybe they are all here... Jeanne

4:32 p.m. - J Pod Lime Kiln now
