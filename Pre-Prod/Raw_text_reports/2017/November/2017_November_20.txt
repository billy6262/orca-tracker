============================================================

Entry 1:
5:10 p.m. - Orcasound -
Listen for Whales has been hearing
SRKW vocalizations live on the Port Townsend hydrophone
for the last hour or so. Sounded like Ks (making the
S16 call
often). -Scott Veirs

now. Impressively large males. -Margaret Marshall

Entry 2:
*

1:40 p.m. - K-pod, In between Lagoon and Bush Points
, and spread east to west. -Scott Jacobson
*

1:35 p.m. - whales are near Lagoon Point
now. Too far for a count or id but I have seen 1 male at least. -Patriciat Prochaska
*
Below are my photos of what I think was
K pod (
confirmed - ALB
) K44 Ripple
(born 2010)! Such a big handsome boy now. Here's a surface sequence of him while K pod was feeding and cruising north about 1pm today in Admiralty Inlet!...they were taken with my iPhone. We did a whale watch tour for our annual staff/celebration day. We were excited to see the whales and did have one helluva choppy ride back to Anacortes but totally worth it! :) I'm not sure of our exact location on the boat but know
the whales were heading north through Admiralty Inlet
when we crossed paths. There may have been about a dozen (hard to count) spread across the water and on either side of the boat. Small groups would cluster and swim, surface, splash and submerge in tight circles with mixes of tail flips and small breaches then continue swimming north to repeat this action again. It seemed like they might have been feeding? -Codi Hamblin

1:05 p.m. -
They are passing
Bush Pt
., spread out, some foraging, one barrel roll, moving steadily northward. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

12:20 p.m. -
they are about 1 mile south of
Bush Pt, much closer to Whidbey side
. The Coast Guard cutter that was heading E must have spotted them, they just stopped and are out on deck.

12:07 p.m. - leaders have passed Foulweather Bluff
, have seen some direction changes/foraging behavior, but mainly headed west out Admiralty at a good pace, closer to the Whidbey side now. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

11:57 a.m. - viewing from Shore Meadows (Whidbey)
. They appear
spread out from Whidbey side to mid channel, headed NW
at a steady pace. -Rachel Haight
*

11:43 a.m. - Dorsals north of Point No Point (PNP)
, north of Hansville, spread out toward PNP. One backwards breach! Now dorsals between Mutiny Bay and Foulweather Bluff. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

9:50 a.m. -
continued steady NB, aiming between Whidbey and PNP. Group - hard to count numbers. Guessing the group from yesterday?

9:25 a.m. -
ok seeing them again, northbound - same general location. Heading north - on course for
between Point No Point and Whidbey
, guessing they will be more on the Whidbey side.

9:15 a.m. - orca spotted - 2 dorsal
, mid-channel with line of sight from
Apple Tree Point Kingston
to S. tip of Whidbey. Unable to tell direction of travel. Saw once, have not seen again, still watching. -Sara Frey

Humpback whales -
November 20 - I finally got back out on the water this past Monday and ended up enjoying a visit with this
humpback in the glassy waters of San Juan Channel
. I liked the shadow of the dorsal fin in the blow in this shot. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

Entry 3:
*

3:45 p.m. - A
humpback was reported in Griffin Bay, San Juan Channel
, on the San Juan side, heading south. Called in by Nancy Butte.
*

2:20 p.m. - Humpback sighted on east side of San Juan Island
(not far from Friday Harbor). The whale wasn't doing deep dives... two breaths and then 3-5 minute dives, but no flukes! It was beautiful...-Mae Cannon
*

11:00 a.m. -
We just saw
3 or 4 humpback whales swimming south in President Channel
. Very cool! President Channel between Point Doughty and Point Kimple (NW of Orcas Island, between Waldron and Orcas Islands.). -Christine Lee
