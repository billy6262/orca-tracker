Orca Sightings for November 4, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:25 p.m. - 2 bottlenose dolphins - west entrance of Hale Passage,
pretty neat. Wondering if that's what the Orca reports were, us and Chilkat haven't been able to acquire any orcas in Carr. I actually thought myself it was two young Orca on the first surfacing, easy to see how others may have been mistaken as well. -Captain Tyler Mckeen, Island Explorer 3
