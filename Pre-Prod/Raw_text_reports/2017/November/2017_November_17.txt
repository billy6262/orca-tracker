Orca Sightings for November 17, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
My first ever DOUBLE SPYHOP!!
Just north and slightly west of Protection Island
Not the best quality but definitley the best moment from our surprise encounter with
K's and Js
today! I so was not ready for this and it happened so fast, I am surprised I was even able to get it somewhat in focus. This was part of a larger, very close knit group that seemed to be socializing and very surface active with a lot of rolling and splashing. Others were spread far and wide in foraging mode. Really wish we could have gotten a top-down look, they were also somewhat chatty on our hydrophone. That's
K16 Opus
spyhopping in the middle. Working on IDing the rest of this group...-Renee Beitzel

Chilkat saw
K pod and some Js milling on south end of Eastern Bank, around
15:30
. No clear direction that we could tell. -Christopher Lewman

Another busy night on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. A noisy humpback whale from
way before
3:30 a.m....and now at
4:46 a.m.
it just got quite loud. How long it will last??? And very faintly SRKW calls...extreme faint actually...both on LK and OS at about
4:41 a.m. At the moment ship noise is drowning out any possibility of hearing about anything. And I posted on my blog about more calls and the J Pod encounter from yesterday 11-16-17. -Jeanne Hyde

Bigg's/Transient killer whales -
November 17 - Haro Strait - Before we were surprised by southern residents on our way home, we spent some time with the
T46's south of Victoria. T46D (born 2000), T46F (born 2012), mom T46 (born est 1964), T46E (born 2003)
. They are one of my favorite matrilines. Matriarch,
T46
, was once captured in Puget Sound in the 70's, but then released for being too big. I can't imagine not having this amazing family around. -Renee Beitzel
