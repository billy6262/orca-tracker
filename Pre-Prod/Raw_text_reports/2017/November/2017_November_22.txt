Only orca photo I got today, of
K26 Lobo. K Pod was northbound past Point No Point this afternoon

Entry 2:

Wild, wet, windy Whidbey with boiling seas and flying spray - that's how the weather's been for a few days now. A break in the clouds
at
3:35 pm this afternoon
afforded a welcome photography opportunity as
K pod passed Bush Point on their way north in Admiralty Inlet
. From marrying up the time this picture was taken and watching a large male foraging closer to the Whidbey side, it seems we were engaging with
K21 (Cappuccino)
. It's a long time since I saw this fabulous whale (though they're all fabulous) with the dramatic, bold saddle-patch, or any of K pod, so this was an early thanksgiving gift. -Sandra Pollard

3:15 pm -
watching
K pod from 1 mile south of Bush Pt.
as they are approaching, slowly, foraging and now some direction changes from some individuals but likely due to foraging, most are still slowly headed toward Bush Pt. Was lucky enough to see one juvenile do a full breach - always such a blessing to see them go by! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

We're seeing dorsals trending north and foraging mid-channel between

11:00 a.m. -
Adult male (dorsal Scoter or Cappucino like) in lead mid channel off
Kayu Kayu Ac park, Richmond Beach
transect Kingston, Kitsap. Another male (dorsal Lobo like) veered over to the west towards several females/younger who are trailing a little behind and west of lead male. Another Male (dorsal Tika like) is east of mid channel trailing, with another male (4th) on west side with few other females/ young who are at the moment porpoising just south of Kingston (sightline). All steady northbound at steady pace across calm seas and balmy temperatures. Looking like K pod due to numbers whales and males but by no means from my distance can I confirm.

10:50 a.m. - single whale foraging just north of mid channel yellow buoy off Richmond Beach
, King county/Presidents Point, Kitsap. Soon after spot more approaching just south of heading north, then two adult males traveling together coming up on the east side of yellow buoy. Calm seas.
