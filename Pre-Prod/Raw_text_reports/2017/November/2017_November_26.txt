Orca Sightings for November 26, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:40 pm -
losing light, but thankfully they are now VERY
close to the Whidbey side
, we could barely see them over neighbor's fence - still traveling north,
1 mile south of Bush Pt
, may get to Bush Pt. while there is almost some light to see them...I saw a tight group of 2 males and 3 - 4 others while Howie saw fins of 1 or 2 more further behind.

4:25 p.m. -
yay - the fog and rain cleared enough to have a little visibility, and I just saw two splashes (one was breach-sized) and one male fin,
1 mile south of Bush Point
, heading west out Admiralty Inlet - passing the entrance to Hood Canal, closer to the Whidbey side.

3:10 p.m. - we just spotted at least 2 male fins
, looking like they are
heading N straight toward Double Bluff or Useless Bay
(watching from S. of Bush Pt, they are NE of the green channel marker, closer to the Whidbey side and heading closer to Whidbey). If they turn further E they will be out of our sight, if they head out Admiralty we should be able to see them better soon depending on visibility....(
4:10 p.m. notes: Visibility here has diminished, can barely see Admiralty, and can't see Mutiny Bay. From my earlier sighting it appeared they were heading straight toward the Whidbey shoreline near Double Bluff, but not sure if they they turned toward south Whidbey/Possession Sound or west toward Mutiny Bay/Bush Pt. Will try to spot them again and hope this squall passes before dark!) -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Just home after watching orcas northbound mid channel directly
east of Pt No Pt. At least 1 male w/ female plus 1
, and a single orca that passed within 400 yards of the point heading north. Very poor visibility - they came with the storm...yes, they should be heading into Admiralty I watched them from

2:10-
2:25 pm
all northbound hard to be sure as they disappeared into the mist but course seemed to be towards south Whidbey. They were spread across and N to S. I saw them from just east of Eglon almost to Possession Point. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
