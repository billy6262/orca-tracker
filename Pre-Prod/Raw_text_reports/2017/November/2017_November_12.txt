Orca Sightings for November 12, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Coastal killer whales -

Entry 2:
Cape Flattery in Neah Bay this morning around 10 am
. We aren't sure how many there were but out in the distance we saw
orcas passing up the Strait of Juan de Fuca behind Tatoosh Island
....they seemed to be going up into the Strait. Under Vancouver island and north of the Olympic peninsula. I would say there had to be
about 4?
They were very far away, and I couldn't tell you if there were any males. As we were watching we also saw quite large pod of harbor porpoises in the numbers of probably 20-40. We also saw two large Stellars playing together below the cliffs! -Audrey Long
