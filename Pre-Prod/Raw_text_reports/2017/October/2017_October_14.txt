Orca Sightings for October 14, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
3 Humpback Whales and a few Harbour Porpoises feeding off Cecil Green Park at UBC in Vancouver at 3pm
. All whales were seen far off shore with spotting scopes by several of us together. -Melissa Hafting

Entry 2:
1:10 p.m. - humpback still feeding in general area a couple miles south of Cultus Bay, South Whidbey
. Could see him rise up lunge feeding amongst the swirl of the gulls. From Haines Wharf, Edmonds. Side note: showed some birders the whale then we all just watched a Peregrine falcon hunting then successfully strike and eat a pigeon on the wharf. Much wildlife all around to take in. I'm leaving now.

12:20 p.m. - Humpback and gulls still feeding approx 2 miles south of Cultus Bay
(between Scatchet and Possession pt) Humback going back and forth in very tight area. Cool to watch. Now from Stamm Overlook Park.

12:05 p.m. - Whale
and hundreds of gulls more to the east now of my previous report. Blows rising right in the middle of all them circling gulls. Must be good eats.

11:45 a.m. - observed several tall blows and they arch of what presuming to be the humpback south of green buoy off Scatchet Head
, South Whidbey. Too far to discern direction of travel. As viewed from Sunset Ave just north of Edmonds Ferry. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

1007- Humpback, CS631 Two Spot, feeding just southwest of Possession Point
. Lots of Bonaparte gulls around too! -Renee Beitzel, Chilkat Express

I think this might be the
bottlenose dolphin
that's been seen around the sound lately. This out of focus shot was taken on 10/14/17 moving south close to shore at
Kayak Point. (Port Susan)
