5:45 p.m. -
Last update from
Richmond Beach
: several stalled and foraged but in general all appear to be trending south. Trailers are two males traveling together mid channel about 1.5 miles south of Richmond Beach/Point Jefferson. I did see another male further south with another group southwest of these males (transect Carkeek and Faye Bainbridge) Lots of directional changes and foraging all afternoon as they slowly make their way down the Sound. Saw at least 2 calves today as well. Too far and backlit for IDs.

5:00 p.m. - Trailing groups about at Point Jefferson/Richmond Beach
mid channel moving southwesterly. Breaches further south out from Port Madison, while others foraging in different directions trailers approach. Many shiny fins and illuminated exhalations as I look west in the golden light over a calm glimmering Puget Sound backdropped by the slightly veiled Olympic Mountain Range.

4:22 p.m. -
in general I think most have continued south spread in all directions but mainly mid channel with mist more west but some east of mid. Trailers include 2 loosely spread groups one adult male and female in each with one calf and one juvie rounding out the two. At least two males and one female still out from Kingston dock/south of Point Wells mid channel foraging.

3:42 p.m - nice tail lob Apple Tree Cove south of Kingston dock

3:35 p.m. - Approx 15 total so far
: Leaders (6+ loosely spread) south of Kingston, pod of approx 4 with male mid channel off
Apple Cove Point/Point Wells
engaged in directional changes, and even more (3-4?) to the north coming mid channel. Lots of salmon jumping all over. Years past I would say Rs based on numbers but too far for IDs for me anyhow.

3:27 p.m. - Seen at least 2 adult males.
Currently what is trailing group consists of at least four including male, still north of
Apple Cove Point
in Ferry lanes mid channel steady southbound. Other group north of Kingston Ferry dock west side of channel. There was a male in lead group earlier

3:18 p.m. -
still streaming in from north. Have seen some directional changes over the past 45 minutes. In general from
south of Apple Cove Point
and to the north and mid channel and west of. Few spread out north of Kingston with two other groups north by 1/2 mile and even further All southbound at the moment

2:30 p.m. -

The project at the
Seattle ferry terminal
will be pile driving today. We are checking the OrcaNet twitter site a few times a day when we do. Today we saw
2 bottlenose dolphin travelling south in front of the ferry terminal
about 100 meters off the pier. No work was occurring at the time. We have 9 marine mammal monitors (10 with me) on-site and are following both a NMFS approved marine mammal monitoring plan and a USFWS marbled murrelet monitoring plan depending on the activity. This is an on-going project expected to go on about 4 years with work occurring between
August 1 and Feb. 15 of any year. We appreciate any "heads up" of marine mammals we can get from OrcaNetwork. -Burt Miller, WSF/Assistant Environmental Manager
