Orca Sightings for October 10, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - It was a Salish Sea hat trick this evening at
Lime Kiln - a couple of humpback whales, lots of Dall's porpoise, and a distant view of J-Pod
. It's always a good day when you can see three different cetacean species, but especially in October and especially in high winds! (Js to the SW of Lime Kiln, mostly way offshore, looked like they flipped and were
southbound at
18:30
). -Monika Wieland Shields

T100Bs

Entry 2:

Bigg's/Transient killer whales -

Entry 3:
T100B's and T087
! Missed the shots but they started off making a kill, harbor seal, the seal was tossed in the air, and displayed many times. After, it became the T87 and T100B1 show! They played and wrestled together for over two hours! Mom and baby were there but they stayed pretty far away, whereas these two stayed by us! T100B1 even made a close pass to the boat, swimming alongside us and checking us out!! Tail lobs, cartwheels, spy hops, partial breaches and a double spyhop snuggle fest!! Towards the end of the tour we saw a submarine and found the entangled humpback! We couldn't stay with the HB long but we contacted NOAA and Orca Network, got pictures, but could not verify if the whale was still entangled or not.

10:51 a.m. - T100Bs and T87 just north of Kingston
right now milling after killing a harbor seal. Here are a few photographs of our amazing experience with
T87 and the T100Bs
after they made a harbor seal kill
just offshore from Edmond
s on Oct 10. Just the day before, Renee Beitzel and I
noticed the underside of T100B1 and could easily see that he was a very excited boy
(if you know what I mean;). Today he gave us additional ventral views showing that he's a boy while he played with much larger, T87. T100B1 and big T87 spent almost our entire visit with them just playing with each other while T100B and T100B2 were off on their own! I've never seen such an old male (est. birth 1962) playing with a young boy for so long (some major bro time)! It was really fun to watch! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist Chilkat Express.

11:00 a.m. - orcas
are still there, along with the Chilkat,
north of Apple Cove Point
. I think there are
4 orcas,
including one male.

10:30 a.m. -
lots of birds hovering above the orcas, on a kill?

10:25 a.m. - 3 orcas mid channel just north of Apple Cove Point (Kingston)
. A few hundred yards north of the Chilkat, which is pointed south away from the orcas. Orcas are just milling about. -Sherman Page
*

11:02 a.m. - Location may be Apple Cove point
, whale watching boat with them now

10:55 a.m. - two Orcas
spotted, appears to be
close to Eglon
not quite mid channel closer to Kitsap side. Unsure of direction. -Darlen Moneypenny

Entry 5:
3:25 p.m. - humpback a few hundred yards off Apple Cove Point (Kingston).
Pointed south on its last dive. -Sherman Page

Entry 6:
3:22 p.m -
Volunteer Sandra Pollard went out to try and keep locate and keep eyes on the whale from the beach. She walked
Double Bluff beach
and did observe blows directionally towards and a bit
south of Point No Point
but could not confirm if it was a humpback let alone the entangled juvenile.
*

1:50 p.m. -
Received a call from Janine Harles aboard the Chilkat that they had located
the entangled juvenile humpback off Double Bluff
. They were with the whale
until about
2:15
, leaving her/him close to Whidbey heading easterly into Useless Bay.
*

Entry 7:
4:45pm heard the unmistakable sound of a large whale in Case Inlet between Harstine Island and Key Peninsula
, just south of Herron Island. Never saw it, so no idea of type or direction. Sure sounded like a single Humpback though; a few long evenly spaced breaths followed by about a 3-5 minutes of silence. So keep your eyes out. It's quite possible it was the dolphin. It may have sounded larger if it came closer into my bay here than the humpbacks have in the past, and would have been harder to spot in the chop we had that day. -Dave Berliner

Entry 8:
8:42 a.m. - Pilot whales between PT (Port Townsend) and Marrowstone Island
. Square head 15' long, not a orca or dolphins. Just one and headed east. No pictures. Seen them the last 3 mornings here. The blocky or square head really stood out to me. Very distinctive to me. -Luke Schwantes

Entry 9:
bottlenose dolphin from Carr Inlet
on 10 October that allowed a species confirmation. -John Calambokidis
