Orca Sightings for October 27, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
What a surprise to come rolling along the edge of
Wilby Shoals (south end of Quadra Island) late this afternoon to find J pod foraging
in typical spread out formation! We had minimal time as the sun had just dipped below the mountains and pics were getting hard to take! But we managed a few ID's, J26, J38, to confirm J pod and love the Sunset colors! -Photo by Nick Templeman,
