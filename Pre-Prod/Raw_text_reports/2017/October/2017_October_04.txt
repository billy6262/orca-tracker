1:11 p.m - Orcas spotted off the Edmonds ferry about 7 mins from Edmonds

Unidentified cetaceans -

Entry 7:
4:13 p.m. -
6+ whales looking from just north of dog park in Edmonds
- appear a bit too small to be orcas. I was directly across from the Kingston ferry terminal- a tad north of the dog park, basically on the other side of the fence. I think they were dolphins or maybe minke whales?? They were black with smaller dorsal fins than an orca. Mid channel. -Jennifer Love-Talley
