Orca Sightings for October 21, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two dolphins went west off Sooke
on Oct 21 2017. They were gray in color and looked like they were looking for food. I suspect they are common Bottlenose Dolphins. I took a video for ID purposes. -Video by Vinz Eberl,
