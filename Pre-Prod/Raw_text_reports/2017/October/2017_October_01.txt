16:00

Entry 2:
one Orca
swimming a few hundred yards south of the Elliott Bay Marina breakwater. Followed from a respectful distance of 300-400 yards. Ultimately saw a group of we believe to be three Orcas. One looked like a male. They were in transit. Left Elliott Bay and turned north up the Puget Sound. They were following the ship channel. Maybe they like deep water. They were being shadowed by a small research boat with two persons on board. Assume this sighting has aready been well documented, but posting anyway. Hope it helps. 47.37.121 N / 122.23.572 W. -Robert Williams

*

Entry 4:
8 a.m.
) We spotted a small pod milling about what must have been
Mutiny Bay
over along Whidbey, using binoculars and a spotting scope from Hansville. They must have been splitting up because a little later we saw two traveling SE mid channel between Point No Point and Whidbey, and then only saw one of the males (huge dorsal - maybe 6 feet tall with a slight curve at the very top) passing much closer to Point No Point, continuing south. Thanks for all the info and tracking! -Rod Lundberg

From my vantage point from the house (slightly
north of Apple Cove) the humpback
initially was moving south and changed direction north around 930 am. -Darlene Moneypenny
*
Humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" viewed by many aboard the Edmonds/Kingston ferry this morning.
Saw this
humpback off of the Puyallup Ferry coming into Kingston
at about

9:15 this morning
. From the ferry I saw the Victoria clipper hauling north near Kingston... at one point it stopped dead in the water so I figured it was a whale sighting, as our ferry approached Kingston they announced a humpback sighting on the left side of the boat. I was already on that side on the deck. I missed the initial breach he did right next to the boat but he continued with tail slaps...-Laurie Eickhoff Ascanio

Minke whales -
October 1 - With a little more taste of fall in the air while still enjoying calm, clear weather, Mystic Sea left the dock to meander along Lopez Island shoreline towards Whale Rocks where a large number of Steller sea lions were hauled out, some dozy, some not so dozy. After venturing into more open water beyond Salmon Bank, we turned towards
Smith and Minor Aquatic Reserve
to follow up on a Minke whale report and were not disappointed. Although known to be somewhat elusive, we spotted the
'Stinky Minke'
surfacing among the abundance of floating bull-kelp before continuing on our way to take a closer look at the many Harbor seals taking time out on the rocks and beaches around the reserve. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

Entry 6:
2:03 p.m. - Just saw what looks like a single false killer whale or bottle nose
(similar looking to what was spotted off of Kingston) on the
north side of Raft Island
(south Puget Sound in Carr Inlet). It was well over ten feet long, dark grey in coloring, and had a more pronounced dorsal fin than a harbor or Dall's porpoise. Definitely not an orca. It was surfacing about every two minutes along the shore. -Kaitlyn Goodeve
*

Entry 7:
Henderson Bay
on 10/1, and got to row next to this solitary creature moving purposefully southward through the bay. I don't think it's an orca, but I know it's not a harbor porpoise, either. It was zigzagging back-and-forth, like a feeding Harbor porpoise, surfacing for 3 to 5 breaths before submerging for a while. I'd say it was about 10-15 feet long. What did I see? -Thank you for any insights, Oliver Kuhn-Wilken

Unidentified cetaceans -
October 1st weekend - (This report in response to
October 13th sighting of a bottlenose dolphin in Elliot Bay. Possible these were the pod of common dolphins who have stayed in Puget Sound (or even harbor porpoise) as all reports have been of just a lone bottlenose). I was curious because I recently saw a pod of them in Colvos Passage, off of the NW side of Vashon. Pretty sure they were bottle nosed as well (two weeks ago). Thanks for responding!
(after further discussion) I'm not certain of the timing but it was around the weekend of 10/1. At least 4 is my guess and they were heading north. It was the first I had ever seen them and they were playful, dipping in and out of the water. There was a similar sighting of an Orca pod in the same area the day before Labor Day and at first I thought it was Orca again, but they were far smaller in scale and grey. I noticed their square snouts." -Emily Raymond
