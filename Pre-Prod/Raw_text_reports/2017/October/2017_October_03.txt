Orca Sightings for October 3, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:26 p.m. -
Amazing Day. Leaving
J Pod and L87 south east bound at Black Creek
. Pink track shows my movement all day since 1030 am.

11:07 AM -
Critically Endangered Southern Resident
Orca J Pod and L87 are foraging off Cape Mudge
(north end of Georgia Strait) right now!
L87 -
Had an amazing encounter today with
all the members of JPod and this beauty whom i am told is L87
! ...We did see alot of forage type behaviour on the Chum Salmon seen on the surface and we were very happy to see this! -Photo by Nick Templeman,

Entry 2:
Haro Strait
with an unusual grouping of
6 whales: the T65Bs, T123s, and T65A2
. It was very cool to directly compare the size of 13 year-old male T65A2 (front) to that of 17 year-old male T123A (behind). Whether they were doing it because it felt good or because they were looking for seals I will never know, but it was pretty cool to see transient killer whales swim right through the kelp bed off Mandarte Island. (I suspect their reason was the former, as one was rolling around at the surface!) -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute,

Active Pass (T100s).
