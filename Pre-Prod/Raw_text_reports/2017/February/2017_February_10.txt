Just spotted large pod off
McCracken Point, Henry Island in Haro Strait

4:45 p.m. -
my neighbor and I spotted
orca's going through Spieden channel
westbound very quickly looked like about
10 to 12 whales
seemingly tight group but they were too far out to make any other ID. I think 1-2 adult males that I could see. -Peggy Mauro

"We saw a pod of
unidentified Orcas
today while on the
WSF from Friday Harbor to Orcas Island
at approximately

2:20 pm
. They were headed in the opposite direction of the ferry. Here is a picture my husband Steve took from the ferry." -Gloria Eppig,

12:20 pm - Georgia Strait -
Watched what looked like
15-20 Orcas
(including 2-3 adult males) today in a magnificent display of tail slaps, fin slaps and full breaches! Were in sight for nearly 3 hours, in the strait
between Chemainus and Thetis (about 20 miles SE of Nanaimo, BC)
. A nice mixture of large and small dorsal fins. Absolutely wonderful to witness this! Feeding, playing. Not happy about one boat that got too close. Fishing trollers were very respectful and gave lots of space. -Courtney Caulford

0645-1030 - Gray Whale less than 30 meters off shore from NASWI
bldg 2556, the Nor'Wester (Naval Air Station Whidbey). It's real close and it's big. It's showing us spouts, back and dorsal fin (no tail yet). Looks like it's eating. It's been swimming up and down the shore for at least the past four hours. Will keep updating if this one stays for three weeks like the one in
November 2016. -Sandy Mattingly
