Ok fellow Whidbey friends.. a huge school of what looks like small gray dolphins (reported as dolphins turned out to be
Harbor porpoise
) passing by. They swim like dolphins. Dozens stretching from our place at
Baby Island to Camano heading north
. They are small though. That looks like what I have seen. (Harbor porpoise per photo provided - ALB) They swim slowly in a rhythmic up and down movement which I associate with dolphins. Just peeking up out of the water enough to see that dorsal fin. Hard to estimate the length from shore but they seem smaller than 6 feet. All swim in the same direction. They must be MANY or they are circling under the water as the procession past our place can take at least 20-30 min or longer. -Heather Routh
