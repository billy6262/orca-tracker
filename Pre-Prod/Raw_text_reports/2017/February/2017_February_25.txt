Orca Sightings for February 25, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Coastal killer whales - Orca sighting
Cascade Head Oregon Coast
: We observed a group of
15 - 45 orca about 2 miles off shore
, moving north. When first sighted they were about a mile or so south of Cascade Head and appeared to be feeding. Saw other surface activity that suggested bait fish and/or other small toothed cetaceans such as other dolphin species but was difficult to tell. Orca blows were frequently in tight groups and lines and very frequent blowing followed by 1-3 minutes of little surface activity. Distance covered was minimal. Count based on seeing at least 15 blows at one time and the fact that they were spread out in 2 - 4 groupings. As they moved north they switched into more traveling mode and were last seen north of Cascade Head less than a mile from shore. Saw at least 3-5 adult male dorsal fins. Observations made from Cascade Head trails between 1430 and 1700. -Steve Engel
