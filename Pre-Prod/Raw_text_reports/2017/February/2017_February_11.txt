Orca Sightings for February 11, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:00 p.m - Georgia Strait
- Mom and babies orca sighting:
5 Orcas - Off the north west side of Lasqueti
, we sighted a female and baby heading up the Georgia strait. She was followed by a single smaller orca that looked like a juvenile behind her and away from her, swimming In the shallow water off Lasqueti. Further behind came another mother with a distinctively large dorsal fin swam by with her baby which had a smaller dorsal fin than the first baby. When the first three were way ahead
closer to Comox Peninsula
they turned sideways in the strait and then the other mother came. People have been catching a lot of spring salmon off Lasqueti the last couple days. We were fishing at the time and didn't catch anything once they went by. It was an especially poignant sighting as I was with my dear friends who had just lost their own baby son two weeks prior. I've heard killer whales have a par of their brain that humans don't have, that allows them to be deeply emotive. I feel like they felt my friends grief and gave them a big shout out that the universe loves them, and life and love exists, even in the midst of such pain. Much gratitude and blessings to the orca pod. -Faren Wolfe

IE4 is currently on scene with juvenile
humpback we nicknamed "Speckles" in north Colvos Passage
. Unknown if this is the same whale spotted several hours ago or if there are two whales in the area. -Erin Johns Gless

Unidentified whales - About

1:00pm
I was walking on beach just north of
mouth of Gig Harbor and a (presumed) adult Gray whale surfaced less than 1/4 mile from shore and headed rapidly north into Colvos Passage
. I saw a couple more blows as it travelled on. It was much larger than the juvenile humpback seen so frequently in this same area. I am used to seeing it from my highbank house instead of the beach and it really looked like a different and bigger whale with almost no dorsal fin, but it was quite close, and no noticeable speckles, it looked more brownish. -Michele Riley Campbell
