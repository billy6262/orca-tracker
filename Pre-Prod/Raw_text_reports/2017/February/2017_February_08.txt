Orca Sightings for February 8, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:50 p.m. -
We just caught a brief glimpse of a whale traveling south at
Kayak Point
(Port Susan, between S. Camano Island and Marysville). We have seen grays in February before but this one is unique in that it has a shark-like dorsal fin...Minke? Did not get a Photo. (could be a humpback, or possible a feeding gray showing the tip of its fluke, looking like a fin? SB) -Gary Lingenfelter
*
Small whale spotted from

8:15am Vashon water taxi
. Spouted twice. The whale was spotted shortly after departing from Vashon north of the island and appeared to be heading west. It spouted twice & turned sideways, but we didn't get a good look at detail. It appeared to be gray & was small; likely juvenile. (possibly the young humpback who has been hanging around the south Sound- ALB) -Karen Davis Smith
