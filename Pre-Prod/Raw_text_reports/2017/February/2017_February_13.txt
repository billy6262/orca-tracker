Orca Sightings for February 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Unidentified Orcas -
Two small groups - of 4 each - seen at 1600-1625 PST Feb 13 off Caulfeild Point, West Vancouver
. Feeding, hunting. One group swam out towards UBC and into middle of Salish Sea. Blows were seen for some distance and quite frequently. Second group - with one very large male - swam alongside an anchored ship at Stearman beach and proceeded towards Dundarave and Lions gate bridge. Have not seen their return as of 1720 PST. Wonder if they're off to Burrard Inlet or Indian Arm? -Jeffrey Franczak

Eastern Juan de Fuca -
I made it down to
NASWI (Naval Air Station Whidbey Island)
to check out the whales, it is an
adult and calf gray whale
. I attached a video of them feed sorry for the poor video quality it was on my phone. In the first few seconds you will see the adult pectoral fin or tail hard to tell and right after you see the calf spyhop a little. I watched them for little more then an hour... Yes that was today around
5pm
. I know it's hard to tell by the video. But there are two whales there, they were only 50 yards or so off the beach. And the calf is tiny. It took me awhile before I seen it. She was hiding in moms wake every time they surfaced. The second video has the calf right at the 15sec mark I can zoom in a little on my phone and she spy hops with her mouth open. (Facebook videos which we are unable to include are inconclusive to us anyhow. Follow up with Eric by phone, he says he is positive he observed a calf and that the adult had a large white dorsal ridge patch which presumably is a match for gray in same area reporte by S Jennings on the 12th ) -Eric Rosemore, Capt. & Naturalist Mystic Sea Charters
