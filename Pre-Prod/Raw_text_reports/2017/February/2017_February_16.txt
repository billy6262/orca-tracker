Bigg's killer whales (Transients)
I saw them 2/16 about 1 mile south of the
Fauntleroy Vashon run
, about half-mile off shore heading south...Didn't get any photos. One large male. Can't determine exact time. Definitely well before sunset. Reviewing the posts, I remember going outside to look in response to

4:45
comments RE Lincoln Park. I live just south of Brace Point. -Jim Nunn

Approx.

4:45 pm- 6 total
that I saw, all passed in between the ferries as they crossed continued southbound through the
Fauntleroy/Vashon ferry lanes
. With the 3 in lead more mid channel, followed by female with calf and adult male still east side of channel. Steady pace southbound in the glow of the setting sun. This family of orcas moved at a steady pace southbound through Puget Sound today making
West Seattle by late afternoon
. These clips are from Emma Schmitz Overlook Park and Lincoln Park a short time before the sun settled in behind the mountains. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

between the Lincoln Park pool and Blake Island
