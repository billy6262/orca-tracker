Orca Sightings for July 23, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Js and Ls - Haro Strait -
Early afternoon pass: Js & Ls made it to & just north of
Lime Kiln State Park
, San Juan Island, stalled then spent time foraging, feeding, & socializing. Approx. 90 seconds in a dozen+ individuals begin to circle around then gather into a stunning side by side formation. Near the end beautiful close-in passes & surface activity just feet from humans on the rocks observing Js & Ls in their home. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

They arrived on scene with the whales at

18:20 off of Henry Island. The L4s, L47s, L26s, L72s, L87, along with the J11s, most of the J17s, and some of the J14s
were in one large, fairly tight group moving north....As they left, the whales were still heading north, past Spieden Channel. -See photos & full encounter report at Center for Whale Research Encounter 55.

After hearing about
Southern Residents spread out and moving sporadically up and down the west side of San Juan Island
, we arrived at
Hannah Heights about
4:30
and were treated to small dorsals in ones and twos many hundreds of yards below us in the tidal rip. Then about
5:20 suddenly a tight group of
8-10 showed up moving south, followed 100 yards back by another group
. Less than five minutes later they had flipped a 180 and turned north past us, moving faster this time with the currents, still close to the rocky shoreline. So we hightailed it up to CWR north of Lime Kiln and they soon arrived, now more spread out but all moving decisively north up Haro Strait. Alisa joined us there shortly before Ken Balcomb mentioned there were a couple of spaces on his boat Shachi to document who's there. We launched from Snug Harbor and within a few minutes had
rounded Kellet Bluff and found the trailers of the bunch about
6:19
. We puttered along parallel at a good distance with the sun at our backs lighting up dorsals and blows and occasional spyhops with bright forested bluffsides for background. Over the next half hour we were witness to the slow travels of the
L47s, the L72s, the L26s, the L4s, the J17s, the J11s, and of course the adaptable L87
moving around the families. We heard the
J16s were a mile or so ahead of us
. All in all a peak experience in perfect conditions. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

And the fun wasn't over! ...we rushed back to the west side as the
Js and Ls came back past Lime Kiln
. In the evening they finally committed to going north and it was beautiful to see 35 of those present traveling in one group, pictured here with Spieden Island in the background. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

By

1:00 pm. Js and Ls
joined up and were now heading back north. Arrived at the north pullout at
Land Bank
met up with Connie, walked down to rocks and soon after watched single female in the lead and approx 4-6 others pass including young ones. A large group was coming up behind. They all looked pretty committed, so I decided to move to Lime Kiln since the leaders had passed the lighthouse. About when I arrived looking south I could see the the large group had stalled and was engaging in a lot of foraging and surface activity back off Land Bank. The
5-6 whales we had off Lime Kiln
foraged for about 45 minutes moving back and forth in the currents. We had 5-6 including 2 calves. This smaller group eventually turned south and joined up with the others off Land Bank and looked to be heading south. I waited around Lime Kiln and it paid off. Around

2:30pm they flipped back north
, I could hear and see them coming towards us. Shortly after most all of Js and some Ls reached LK park with some going beyond the lighthouse. Lots of social and foraging behavior, very surface active (breaches, spyhops, tail lobs, pec slaps, rolling, inverted tail slaps, vocalizing, socializing) Stunning back and forth passes the entire stretch of the park. At one point, off the south lookout
about 10 whales lined up in formation side by side as if in some greeting ceremony
, some logging and then a few started tail slapping. Later,
one whale, while moving towards the rocks, cartwheeled off the rocks, moved in closer and cartwheeled a 2nd time just feet from those standing at waters edge
then continued to swim underwater along the shoreline to the south. They all eventually turned back south while we all absorbed and appreciated these beings we just hung out with and what we were lucky enough to be a part of. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

The
L4s, L26s, L47s, and L72s
made it in overnight, and this morning
J-Pod came in to join them
. It was a pretty special several hours this afternoon on the west side, including this once in a lifetime moment for me - I can only imagine this mom and calf must have been eye to eye underwater as they stopped and bobbed at the surface just a few yards off the rocks right in front of us.

1:10 p.m - Leaders at Hannah Heights
northbound.

12:34 p.m - Js are about halfway across aiming for Ls at False Bay
.

11:59 a.m. -
2 boats still just south of Land Bank and seeing boats
south of Discovery with inbound Js
. -Monika Wieland Shields
*

12:15 p.m. - Dorsals! False Bay
southbound. Good to see bait balls though! Haven't noticed quite as many this year. -Cher Renke
*

9:30 a.m. - from South Beach spotted few dorsals off Eagle Point
. Moved over to Eagle Point and watched who turned out to be the
L4s
(per Center for Whale Research)
off Eagle Point
and to the north. Around 1

0:15am
they gathered into a couple of groups and slowly headed north. Overcast skies, slight wind and mildly rough water. They made it to about
Edwards Point then stalled and flipped direction
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Center for Whale Research: Stewart went on another early morning whale search by car down to the south end of SJI and saw
whales off South Beach
again. Phone calls were made and then Stewart, Astrid, and Candice met Dave down at the boat and left Snug Harbor at 0740. We found our first
whales right off Eagle Point at 0808
....By this time it was obvious that we only had the L4s on the west side of SJI. Jeff LaMarsh then found the
L26s, L47s, and L72s out near Race Rocks

We were excited to get an
6 am
report from Ron Mallon that
many orca were heading east past Sooke.
..Sure enough we had the pleasure to encounter some of L Pod of the Southern Resident Killer Whales just past Race Rocks Lighthouse. (see photo below of
Muncher L91, Marina L47 and Crewser L92
). -Paul Pudwell

Diane Kurzontkowski reportrd a
large whale with a dorsal fin and long body at 4 pm
