8:05 p.m. - approximately between Matia Island and the northern tip of Lummi Island, 5-7 orcas
. We are watching them very distantly from the north shore of Orcas Island and we can't tell if they are residents or transients, and we are also having a hard time pinpointing exactly where they are since we are so far, though with our good binoculars we can see them. We noticed about eight boats in a group watching them...-Rob Lodermeier

6:45 pm
headed northwest. -Shelly Greybeck

Another beautiful day on Friday - and exciting to hear we had
Biggs (transient) killer whales just outside Anacortes
. Several groups of
T's, T46s, 36s, 36Bs and 99s
, very spread out! Wow - a lot of whales. We traveled with them slowly southbound for a while, then took a side trip to check out the seals w/pups on Colville Island, and several bald eagles. With time to spare, we headed back to the group of T's as they frolicked and fed right off NAS Whidbey, traveling back and forth, still spread out. After some great viewing of these amazing whales, we reluctantly headed back to port - another great day aboard the Mystic Sea. 14-year-old male T46E, one of the many Bigg's/Transient orcas encountered traveling together today in Rosario and Eastern Juan de Fuca Straits. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

T34s, T37 & T37Bs
- A whole lot of beautiful travel mode during this part of their inland Puget Sound summer day. First southbound to the north end of
Elliot Bay
where they stalled briefly then flipped direction. A short time later we left them as they continued their now zig -zagging northward travels. Later, we relocated and watched the families off
Point Wells, Woodway/South Edmonds
still in northbound zig-zag travel mode until we left them yonder nearing the southend of Admiralty Inlet. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

5 year old,
T37B1
, as he surfaced nearby with a piece of his lunch, and yep, more teeth! ...we found the
T37Bs with T37 and T34s just south Possession Point
, Whidbey Island. When we arrived they appeared to be finishing up a kill and began prey sharing. After all the hard work was over we observed a lot of playtime. -Photo by Renee Beitzel,

Humpback whales around Sooke
. Here are a few pictures from our morning tour. -Photo by Paul Pudwell,

Entry 9:
south end of Fox Island in the Carr Inlet at about
4:30 pm
. We just got back in from jet skiing! This guy breached about 50 yards from us, really startling!! We moved away and had a great time watching this amazing animal! -Dawn Morris
*
Heard whale
breathing at 1 am
, located in the area of
Gertrude Is off McNeil
. Seemed to be in "sleeping" mode. What I am currently witnessing, and what I believe I am hearing,
appears to me to be a humpback whale
. It seems to always travel solo. It was close enough around the time of my first report that I could tell it was definitely not an orca and appeared to me to be a humpback. The whale breaching yesterday definitely looked like a humpback whale to me through binoculars. -Erin Dugger Reetz
*

Entry 10:
9:00 am a humpback passed very close to shore in Dilworth
. Inside the buoys and between the fishing boats! Slowly made it's way north and more toward the shipping lanes than shore.
9:40 I could see off in the distance headed past Glen Acres towards the ferry. -Aimee Demarest

8:45 p.m. -
Friday night,
July 14th, we were eating dinner on our sailboat
in the north cove of Jones island and we saw a group of whales
come by from the south
between Jones and Orcas
traveling north west towards Stewart and Spieden. At least three whale watching boats following and a couple private boats. -Allison Evans
