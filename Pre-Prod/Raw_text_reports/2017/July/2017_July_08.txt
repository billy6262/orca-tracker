9:00 p.m. - 2 or 3 adults just off Gabriola island.
Between Gabe and Decourcey, near Gabriola Narrows. 2100hr this evening. Heading for False Narrows. It's high tide so no problems for them. Just looked as though they were traveling. When I first saw them they were near me (Gabriola), then they moved across the channel nearer Decourcey and then Link Islands. We were able to hear them pretty well during this period, although sighting was problematic due to distance. Then they sort of disappeared. -Wanda Blok

Puget Sound -
8:30 p.m. - pod of approx 8 (no adult males)
has drifted north. Sightline
between Carkeek and Point Jefferson around mid channel
. Circling and surface active. Presumably they have been on a kill.

7:55 p.m. -
they've moved west to m
id channel between Carkeek and Port Madison
. Still directional changes too far to say for sure if in hunt but looking that way. And too far for ID.

have moved offshore a bit more. Circling and directional changes last surface. On a dive now.
