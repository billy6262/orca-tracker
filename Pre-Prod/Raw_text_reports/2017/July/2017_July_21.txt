Orca Sightings for July 21, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
I looked into information from Tasli Shaw who was also on the boat.
T37As, T34s with T37Bs and T46s
. The images I sent you were from the 5pm sunset sail which left Cowichan Bay (it's close to Duncan). We sailed for a short time to
north Pender Island area
. I hope this information helps. -Stephen Ellwood

Today we met up with the
T34s, T37, and T37Bs near Stuart Island
, following them
around Turn Point into Boundary Pass
on this beautiful Pacific Northwest drizzly summer afternoon. These transient killer whales are so different from the residents I've spent more time with. Groups and individuals just appear and disappear out of no where, and as I've gotten to observe them more this summer, the more mysterious they've become! -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,
