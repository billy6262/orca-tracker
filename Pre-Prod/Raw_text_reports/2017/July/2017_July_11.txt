Orca Sightings for July 11, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
T034s, T036, T036Bs, T037Bs , T046's, T037 and the T099s
. The two groups were split by a few miles but after a successful porpoise hunt, the two groups got together and the socialzing and vocals were insane. -Photo by Gary Sutton,

Entry 2:
T99s, T36, T36Bs, and T37A1 in President's Channel
and followed them over towards Sucia off the north end of Orcas Island. We were debating on what date the number of encounters we have this year with the Southern Residents might surpass the number of encounters we've had with transients, but it's starting to feel like that may not ever happen, as there continue to be multiple groups of Ts around the Salish Sea on a daily basis and the days continue to slip off the calendar with no word on the salmon-eating residents. -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI

Alaskan killer whales -

Entry 3:
Alaskan Residents AX27s and AP pod (20+, including at least 3 males)
. On
July 11th, we encountered part of
AP pod and most of the AX27s in Kachemak Bay, Alaska.
Initially they were foraging but soon they stoppped and began socializing with one another. -Emma Luck

Entry 4:
west of Chambers Bay
. The whale was
between Fox and McNeil islands
. It must be spending its time between Chambers Bay and the two islands. Lots of bait fish in the area. Bait fish must be feeding on plankton/krill. Quite a few porpoise as well. -Photo by Jon Tornquist,
