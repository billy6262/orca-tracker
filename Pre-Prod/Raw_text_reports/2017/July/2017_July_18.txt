Tuesday
July 18 - choices, choices, go find the Biggs (transient) killer whales, or welcome back our endangered Resident orcas - L-pod - to the Salish Sea! L-pod won! We traveled inter-island towards the
west side of San Juan Island, finding L-pod
very spread out as they foraged. A lot of whales in the distance, so good to see them back in our waters. We identified a few -
L-72, Racer (see photo below) and her son L105 Fluke, also L116 Finn
(t
hanks to Melisa Pinnow, CWR
). Homeward bound we checked out harbor seals with pups - and several bald eagles - the weather was outstanding - a great day to be aboard the Mystic Sea!! Welcome back L-pod! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
*
Sure was wonderful to see
L pod members
today! According to the Center for Whale Research,
everyone except the L12's and the L54's
were present. Here's to hoping their bellies are full of Chinook salmon! The best thing we can do for this critically Endangered group of Killer whales, is to bring back their food! Supporting dam removal projects, habitat restoration, pollution mitigation, and choosing sustainably harvested seafood and avoiding farmed salmon. "No fish, no Blackfish." -Traci Walter

Beautiful orca sightings on the west side of San Juan Island near
Lime Kiln State Park
!! Two different pods with at least 7-8 whales.. Breeching, hunting and swimming about. Stunning!! We saw them multiple times throughout the day.. the most activity we viewed was
10am, 12pm and 2pm.
Around 12 they passed though pretty quickly. 10am and later in the day they seemed to hang out much longer in one area. Unfortunately, I did not get any photos. I was on shore and had my binoculars to see them. -Guinevere Ilana
