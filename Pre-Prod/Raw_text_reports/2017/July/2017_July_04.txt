7:45 p.m. - Orca pod seen while on the Sidney-Anacortes ferry.
I saw one individual, but others onboard reported seeing several. traveling. Location: 48.5774, -122.879. Number:
Probably 3
. I saw one breach and simultaneously other passengers saw two breach some distance away. Direction: My orientation was a little messed up, but I'm fairly certain they were traveling northwest
between Shaw and Orcas
. If not, then they were traveling between Shaw and Lopez. -Erik Frederickson

Entry 5:

2:01 p.m. -
Just watched him a while from our sail boat between
Pt Defiance and Vashon ferry
. We drifted to watch him in the distance and then he surprised us all when came up right next to us after a deep dive! SO awesome! -Jennifer Greiner Clark
*

11:43 a.m. -
Just spotted it! It's on the
south side of Vashon
and still heading east. Lots of tail slaps! It was just west of the Vashon ferry dock when I saw it. -Josh Hollandsworth

12:15 p.m. - Humpback surfaced fairly far out near Browns Point.

11:12 a.m. -
Humpback BX1251 Orion still milling as seen from
Point Defiance Dalco Passage Viewpoint
. Deep dive pointed eastward still.

10:58 a.m. - Humpback
heading east as viewed from
Dalco Passage overlook at Point Defiance
. Been watching for about an hour now. Slow shallow dives (about 6-8) then the usual longer dives.

10:21 a.m. - surfaced just off Dalco Passage
viewpoint at Point Defiance. Five surfaces then a deep dive generally eastward. -Jill Clogston
*

10:45 a.m. - Dalco Pt. Humpback milling
about for about and hour. -Bill Clogston
*

8:18 a.m. -
Circling around. Big tail. Looks like Orion photos I've seen. Milling about...Possibly lunge feeding?

8:12 a.m. -
Wow. He just pec waved at the ferry! I hope somebody got a photo

8:07 a.m. -
He turned around and is headed back to the point.

8:02 a.m. -
Awesome start to the day.
0802 humpback headed towards Owens Beach
. Couple blows and a dive. Waved his tail. Talequah ferry is headed back to Point Defiance. Should have a good view. Close to yacht club. -Cathy & Mark Baker
*

7:16 p.m. -
I just saw a blow in the area I last saw it this morning, off
Green Point, Arletta in Carr Inlet
. It's still here!

2:35 p.m. -
I haven't heard it or seen it for quite some time. It started to drift to the northwest earlier, down the inlet in the direction of
Horsehead Bay
, when I lost track of it...I sure feel honored when these guys spend some time in our neighborhood! Thanks for all you do.

11:38 a.m. - There is a humpback
that has been floating along near the surface for at least the last few hours. It gently goes under water and we can hear it Blow, and eventually it comes back up. Sometimes we can see the tail fin come up as it goes under. We've watched this whale the past couple of days, and I hope the whale is now just in a rest mode but it seems unbothered by boats that inadvertently zoom right past it. I want to make sure there's no alarm over entanglement in a net that would prevent it from diving properly or whatever. I hope this makes sense. I have not been able to find my answer online so I really appreciate your help. -Erin Dugger Reetz

Entry 6:
9:30 AM a small gray(immature?)
was sighted in
Bellingham Bay
by the Bellingham Bay Outrigger Paddlers. They were just coming into shore as I was putting in my kayak at the Community Boating Center, near the Alaska ferry terminal. No one had a camera and they told me it seemed headed in toward us. I paddled out to mid-bay and didn't see it. Maybe they've reported it?? If it's mom was nearby I hope it is reunited! -Gillian Brightwater
