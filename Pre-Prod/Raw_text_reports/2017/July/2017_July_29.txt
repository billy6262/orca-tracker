Orca Sightings for July 29, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another spectacular day on the Salish Sea - no orca reports today, so it was a
'one' humpback
day - and he/she was on a mission traveling from point A (
Tumbo Island/East Point
) towards point B (Patos Island), lots of surfacing but no tail flukes, sometimes hitting 9 nm/hr! We had some great viewing of this whale before turning for home via several harbor seal haul-outs, bald eagle viewing, and some elusive harbor porpoise. A beautiful day on the water! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Entry 6:
1 unknown whale
8:00 pm between Ketron Island and Anderson Island

My husband saw possibly
3 whales around
6:40 this morning off the shore from downtown Steilacoom
. He didn't know what kind for certain but thinks
maybe orcas
. We've seen humpbacks and lots of common dolphins. He thought these were different. He didn't know what direction they were going. It
could've been humpback
though. We've never seen them as close as these were. -Suzy Johnson

June 27 into
June 28 -
Possible Orca sighting in Case inlet between Herron Island and Harstine

2:30am. (
Several humpbacks have been in south Puget Sound, with 2 showing up later on the 28th in Case Inlet- ALB
). -Max Peters
