Orca Sightings for July 27, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:30 pm -
5:00 pm - T37As.
When we first headed out they had been reported near Matia headed south but when we got there they were
hugging the shore along the north end of Orcas
. They stayed close to shore for about an hour, then come out into open water. They began chasing down a harbor porpoise shortly after that. Mom -
T37A did most of the work flipping the porpoise into the air
several times, then the younger whales came in and seemed to participate once there was less activity. The predation event lasted about 8 to 10 minutes total and they left the lungs and some of the internal organs behind when they were finished. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

Entry 2:
Georgia Strait -
7:00 a.m
. - Just sighted
a pod moving north from Dolphin Beach on Vancouver island
! It's from the houses on
Nanoose Bay
, around 20 mins drive from Parksville looking out onto the strait. They were quite far out but I'd say
6-8 orcas with approx 2 males.

Saratoga Passage, North Puget Sound - I live on the west side at
Camano Head. At
7:00 a.m.
this morning while sipping Java on my deck, I spotted this
whale
between Langley Marina and our house. It went slightly to the north, turned and came back south. -Photo by MJ Sawyer,

Entry 3:
*
Central Puget Sound - It passed by us on
Yeomalt (south of Skiff Point) Bainbridge very close to shore at 7.27
. Smooth dark skin with dorsal humpback. Headed south traveling quickly. -Kathleen Paulsson
*

7:20 p.m. - Whale
just breached in front of our waterfront house on the
east central shore of Bainbridge Island (Skiff Point)
. It did have a dorsal--relatively smooth skin but clearly not an Orca. Unusually close to shore, heading south! Thrilling!" -Katherine Kennedy

6:37 p.m. -
I just saw a large
humpback pass the Maury side of Vashon
just south of Point Robinson headed north at a steady pace on the west side of the channel. Gorgeous! -Janna Ignatow
*

Entry 4:
8:30 p.m. - There is a single humpback in Case Inlet
. Past McMicken Island. Going north now near Herron Island. Mid-channel. -Ron Hebron
*

6:00 p.m. - This same humpback ended up just north of Boston Harbor
very near the eastern shore. It was VERY active - with breaches, pec slaps, and circling in the area. It gave the people fishing quite a show. No photos. After about 30 minutes I lost sight of it as it headed north, presumably back into Dana Passage. -Kim Merriman
*

4:55 p.m. - Humpback in Peale Passage between Harstine and Squaxin
. Moving south too quickly for a picture, but WOW! -Mia Bosetti
*
Playing down at
Pt. Ruston around 3pm when this humpback
swam by. We watched him surface and dive a few time. -Lindsay Ekblad

10:45 a.m. -
There's one by the
channel marker at the mouth of Henderson now
. Headed towards Johnson point. -Nick Wenzel
