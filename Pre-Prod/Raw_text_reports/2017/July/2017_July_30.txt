Entry 3:
Notes on Humpback Calves by Tasli Shaw, Naturalist, who runs Humpbacks of the Salish Sea Facebook Page: "So the story so far as I can tell with the photos that have been posted there are three confirmed calves: Split Fluke's, Smiley' s, and now Hydra's confirmed today. There are two that I am not so sure of, one is Avalanche, based off the few photos from Alethea it looks too white to be a calf, and no one else has shared images to corroborate the sighting. The second question mark is Europa (a BCXuk listed in Keta Coastal.Conservation) that was photographed by Janine a few weeks ago with what appears to be a calf. But again, there are no other photos of these two on any other day, so it's not confirmed. Still, 3 babies is pretty awesome for around here!"

We observed the
single whale
travelling northbound, middle of the passage, from Jarrel's Cove past Dougal Point at the
north end of Pickering Passage
, breaching frequently. One of us estimated
30 breaches
. It may have started after a speedboat passed closely. Not sure of species, as I've only seen orca and humpback before. But the pectoral fins were long and bumpy. Breacing while traveling 47.293793, -122.879425. -Andrew Graham
