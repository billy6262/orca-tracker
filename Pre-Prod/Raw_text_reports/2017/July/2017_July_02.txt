Entry 4:

South Puget Sound - Olympia to Case Inlet -
10:08 p.m.
- Just saw at least one, maybe two whales in Case Inlet, near
Allyn
. It's getting dark and hard to track, they didn't stay more than 5 minutes. Guessing it's the wandering humpback. Didn't look like an orca. -Valerie Gan

I only saw it surface around four times before it disappeared. Most of those times I only saw the blow.

7:10 p.m. - Blow just spotted off Indian Cove
(It's a marina that is about a mile south of the north point of Harstine on the Pickering Passage side of Harstine Island.) -Connor O'Brien

It came through Pickering Passage about 7pm Sunday

YAY, ust saw it surface 5 times. It's still heading north, but it is heading
closer to the Eld Inlet side
and toward Hunter Point/Squaxin Island. That is the southeast side of Harstine Island in the background and Dana Passage on the right. -Kim Merriman,

Here is a photo taken just now
(
3:00)... That is Priest Point Park
on the far shore. She lives on the other shore very near (to the south) of the Olympia Country Club. Whale is still heading north with slow surfacing and long down times. This is a different whale than the one that has been in this area for weeks. -Kim Merriman,

2:40 p.m. -
Confirmed. It is now heading north in the
deep southern part of Budd Inlet
. It is about 1/2 mile from the channel marker just north of Anthony's Hearthfire Grill and KGY radio station. Mid channel."

2:19 p.m. -
There is a report (second hand) that there is
a humpback at Anthony's restaurant
at the very southern end of Budd Inlet. That's as far south as one can go and be near the Capitol. -Kim Merriman

My husband and I were stand up paddle boarding and heard the unmistakable sound. It (or they?) surfaced twice and then turned to give us a nice tail display. Less than 100 yards away! We were headed SW
between Zittles and Johnson Point around
10:40am
, 7/2/17. -Anna Larson Newton

9:45 a.m. - humpback heading Northwest toward Johnston Point road toward Zittle's Marina
. Several breaches!! (Zittles is on Nisqually Reach, east side of Johnson Point, Olympia). -Jami Rouse Nagel

You can see the whales (2?) from the
north end of Ruston Way

We are on the ferry arriving at
PT Defiance

We spotted whale/s at

1:50 pm in Dalco Passage between Vashon Island and Point Defiance Park
