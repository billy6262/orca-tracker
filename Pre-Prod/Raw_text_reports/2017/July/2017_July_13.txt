Orca Sightings for July 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
South Puget Sound -

8:18 p.m. - Single orca playfully spyhopping across Carr Inlet between Fox island and McNeil towards Chambers Bay
. I am 99% certain it was an orca. Very active spyhopping. Thought i saw an eye patch - I don't want to lead people astray - sure looked like an orca to me and friend.
It was there again this am (
July 14th)
(there was
also a humpback in this very area
reported by a few others). -Edward StOnge
*
July 13 - Eastern Juan de Fuca - They were headed that way (towards Admiralty) but made a kill then turned and
headed back towards Minor
when we left them~~ -Marcie Barney Goldberg
*
I watched from about

5:50-
6:45
. Could see whales [
orcas
] for a bit, then boats took a turn west and I left then. Very possible some continued south but they were far enough offshore you could barely see with binos. -Rachel Haight
*
We may have Ts entering Admiralty Inlet tonight!
T51, T37, 37Bs and possibly the 34's.
Big group that split right before we left them. Heading south angling toward the Sound. They were just passing Naval Air Station southbound at

5:30
, we turned and came home through Deception. They were last reported just
north of Minor Island at
6:00 pm
. They had longish down times. It's possible they eventually went west but it's also approaching being too far south for most boats out there. I'm hoping they kept going south! -Renee Beitzel
*
Mike from WA State Ferries called to relay a report from one of their ferries of
6 orcas in Thatcher Pass (between Blakely Island and Lopez/Decatur Islands in the San Juans) at
8:46 am
, no direction of travel given.

Those aboard Mystic Sea's Whale Watching cruise on Thursday got to see a bit of everything! We had lovely weather and wildlife sightings both in and out of the water. We began our journey traveling to the south side of Lopez Island where we spent 90 minutes with a group of transient orcas as they swam about. This group of
8 to 10 gigantic whales were later identified as the T37As and possibly the T77s
. We stayed with them as they demonstrated their beauty and grace before cruising on towards
Smith Island
. Once there, passengers saw a puffin (which typically happens less than a handful of times each season)! We then ventured on to Minor Island where we stopped to gaze at harbor seals with their pups and a golden eagle as it feasted...-Amy W., Mystic Sea

Hi there, just sitting here watching the sunset and a whale having a very active time breaching over and over again, across the way
between McNeil Island and the Key Peninsula in Carr Inlet
. -Erin Dugger Reetz

I went back out tonight and found the whale in the same area. (
between Fox and McNeil islands
) Two breaches and multiple surfacing views. -Jon Tornquist

can confirm it was a young
breaching humpback off pier 69

Just saw it. Could not tell the direction of travel or fin details. She was a couple hundred yards ahead off the bow of
the Bremerton ferry
. Clearly slapping her fins off the water. Very cool to see. -Jeremy Loether

WS Ferries reports
a gray whale (or possibly humpback) along the Seattle-Bainbridge route

We saw a young
humpback
breaching and tail slapping and generally just playing on the
Vashon water taxi route
tonight heading to the island... more than halfway there!! Little friend having a great time!! -Molly Jordan
