Orca Sightings for July 7, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan & Spieden Channels - While the Southern Residents continue to be absent (since
June 30), the
transient killer whales continue to astound, just by their shear numbers here in the Salish Sea.
Several times this year we've had a matriline of transients become temporary residents around the San Juan Islands, and recently that family has been the T49As. We got out for another encounter with the four of them this afternoon. This is male
T49A1
with beautiful
Spieden Island
as a back drop. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,
