Orca Sightings for July 1, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
I listened to whale blows
from about
11:30 pm last night to nearly 1 am
. One whale. It sounded like it
would go south the Dilworth Point and then slightly north
just past my house....north of the point. It was really cool that it seem to stay in this pretty tight circle. Generally they are just passing through. I am assuming it was a humpback. I think it traveled north when it left this area. -Aimee Demarest

Coastal killer whales - WA Coast - Between
8 to
8:30pm - 3 orcas spotted. Ocean shores.
They were just north of the north jetty in Ocean shores. I don't know a great deal about whales but they didn't seem to just be traveling. They stayed in the same general area for about 15 minutes or so. Spouting and even a little breaching.The were headed north. Distance out...well, we could see the spouting from our condo deck which is how we first spotted them. Then we grabbed binoculars. -Patricia Proctor Warnick
