Orca Sightings for June 22, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod was outside Tofino
today. Nearly 9 miles off shore. Happy to report they ate a lot of fish. They left a trail of scraps for miles. Looks like they're heading down to the coast back home. -Report & photo by Shaun Parniak,

Entry 3:
Depature Bay, BC -
8:00 p.m. -
There was a pod of
3 orcas in Departure Bay (Nanaimo)
. They did one quick loop and then returned to the channel. I'd say they were in the bay for 5-10 minutes. They appeared to be feeding. They did one small counter-clockwise loop of Departure Bay, then left. -Dan McIver
