Entry 3:
North Puget Sound -
6:45 pm. -
There has been a whale past 24 hrs (assuming it stayed after our moonlit watching it and now see it today
6:45pm outside off
186th & Sound View Place, Edmonds
. Maybe humpback. -Anaisa Gerbig
*

12:05 p.m. - for last hour humpback(s)
has been milling/foraging continuously, northbound southbound in same general area. Surface of 4-5 times for about a minute before sounding/fluking for a few. Healthy blows, all only visible with binoculars. From
Ocean Ave in Edmonds
sight line primarily mid Double Bluff, Whidbey. Probably 2 whales based on times but too far to confirm and have not seen them surface together. Seas choppy, sky clear with some incoming marine air resulting in some haze further west, mild wind.

11:03 a.m. -
spotted blows, then gorgeous all-white pec fin waving high in the air, then a pec slap, then deep dive showing fluke. At least
3 miles west of north Edmonds
and 3 miles south of Possession Point. Boat obscured view so not sure if diving whale was same as Pec waver or 2nd whale. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

I'm not on Chilkat just hiking at Ebeys Landing. -Renee Beitzel

Entry 4:
There were several sightings of
a whale between Glacier and Maury Marine Park
. A group of us watched it from

8:30 pm to a little after 9 p.m.
. It came astonishingly close to shore on the west side of that passage. Maybe 50 feet from the water's edge? We watched as it migrated slightly north and then east further toward to middle of the passage. It was surfacing, blowing, etc. It was stunningly huge and loud. So unexpected and utterly amazing! -Barbara Weber

Entry 5:
Meadow Point at approximately
7:30 pm
, we noticed a large whale surface about 150 ft from our boat. The whale was larger than whales I have seen in the area in the past. We were initially thinking it was a humpback, but the size of the whale, and the fact that in three separate dives it did not fluke, has me wondering if it was in fact a fin whale. Traveling, we saw three dives, ten spouts, no flukes or fin slaps. (confirmed humpback, see report below) -Jason Christensen

7:10 p.m. - Humpback whale
, mid channel between Meadow Point (
Golden Gardens, North Seattle
) and North tip of Bainbridge. -Photo by Gary Peterson,

Entry 6:
two humpback whales at the south end of Possession Bar
on Chilkat Express, the morning of
June 28. It was
BCX1251, Orion
, with another whale that I didn't see the flukes well enough to identify. The two whales breached multiple times in a row, and we even saw several cartwheels that appeared to be aggressive in nature between the whales, with one whale almost landing on top of the other!!
