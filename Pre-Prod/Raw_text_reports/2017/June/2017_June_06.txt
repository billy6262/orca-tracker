Tuesday 6/6. Special day. I was able to watch the
T65As
do a close pass by of
SJ County Park
. After they passed, I headed to the land bank where I was scheduled to volunteer as the naturalist for the 2-5pm shift. I assumed the family would've passed the land bank already by the time I got there, but as I stepped out of the car I saw them still slowly heading my way, just entering the northern land bank. Once they made it to
the middle land bank where I was, they stopped and stayed there with me. They stalled out there for 3.5 hours
, not leaving until I packed up my gear and started walking up the hill. This is my favorite T family, and it was so good to see all
five
of them looking healthy and vibrant. The kids have all done some growing, especially T65A2 who I refer to as Chaser. I always see him chasing something but have yet to see him catch something. It was magic.
Leader is T65A, the sprouter in T65A2 "Chaser" and in the back is T65A3
. I think the little one is T65A5 since he/she is always tucked in next to mom. T65A4 isn't pictured but was present. That one loves hanging by big bro A2. Taken from San Juan Island Land Bank. -Ariel Yseth

Case Inlet -
4:45 p.m. - Whale was here all day
feeding just north and west of Mcmicken and in the bay.

11:00 a.m. -
He, or she?, returned. I think it had an irregular dorsal fin.

8:00 a.m.- Whale (not orca) between Harstine and McMicken Islands in Case Inlet
. Whale heading north. Couldn't see clearly, but breathing caught my ear then I spotted it a few times as it surfaced.
Not sure what type of whale
. Traveling, feeding. I was looking for dolphins that were here 2 days ago when I heard the whale breathe right below the house in the bay. I looked down it was going under about 100' off shore. Definitely a big whale. I ran for my camera and it surfaced 3-4 times in front of the house but looking through my lens I had a hard time finding it each time. I've only seen whales in Hawaii and Deception pass, so this was a treat. (
See
humpback
photo below. Also blurry photos sent of whale lunge feeding - ALB

Central Puget Sound -
8:45 p.m. - Single humpback off of Alki Beach
, heading past Discovery Park now. We thought it
may be a humpback
, but have only seen orcas, so thought that was what it was. The movement seems consistent with a humpback, from what we know (very little) about whales. -Dana and Mark J. Mauzey

Commencement Bay -
7:30 p.m. -
It came into the cove at Jack Hyde Park near the rocks (less than 10 ft away from me). Thought it was a humpback but
could have been a gray whale?
it was Tuesday around
7:30pm. I was on the grass hill and spotted the spout so close to the dock, I couldn't believe my eyes. I believed there was a boat following much too close which is why I think it came into the shallow cove near the beach for a bit. Gray in color, lots of barnacles, no distinct dorsal (I'm a birder, not a whaler) and I remember seeing an orange spot on its fluke. Once it turned the corner, it picked up immense speed and followed the shoreline in the direction of Thea Foss and out of my view. Now that I've done a bit of research, I would say it looked much more like a Gray Whale. -Christina Felty

Unidentified whales - (
We have
several humpbacks and at least 2 grays inland Puget Sound
often times at the same time in the same general area. These reports could be either or a mix of both types in close proximity to one another - ALB
)
Commencement Bay -

Entry 7:
7:14 p.m. - Humpback
sighted from the deck at Katie Down's in Tacoma. I am by no means an expert, but it looked and moved like the other humpbacks I have seen in the past- saw the dorsal fin.
Could have also been a gray whale I suppose
. Seemed smaller than a typical adult. Surfaced twice and then dove, so didn't get any photos. -Amanda Jones Martin
*
Whale spouts in Commencement Bay this morning
. Not Orcas, too far away to identify. Last spouts seen
near the Port of Tacoma. Between 10am and 11am.
Baleen whales (my guess is 3). Not sure if humpbacks or other, not close enough. Have seen both humpbacks and grays before and could distinguish between those if I could have gotten a closer look. They were viewed from land on Tacoma side of bay, looked to be closer to Pt Brown side of bay. Could see spouts and backs, no view of fins or flukes. -Carol Styner
