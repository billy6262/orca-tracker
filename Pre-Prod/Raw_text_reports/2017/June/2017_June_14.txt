Orca Sightings for June 14, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was wondering if you could identify
a large pod of orcas
that put on a spectacular show just off the coast from
Shirley (Sooke)
There was about 30 orcas slowly moving through. It was Wednesday
June 14th at about 6-7Pm heading towards Victoria from Sooke down the Juan de Fuca. I was on land, they were only about 200 metres off shore. -Haley McLean

Photos by Haley below. Many more than used in this report were submitted and sent to the Center for Whale Research. Dave Ellifrit ID NOTES: " Interesting,
along with the L12s, J pod and L87
are there too....I see
J27, J38, J47, and L87
in the photos. Thanks for the pics. Dave"

Another special day
off Sooke finding some of L Pod (L12's)
of the Southern Resident Killer Whales minutes from our docks. They were slowly feeding and traveling west...In the Juan De Fuca Strait and had them all to ourselves for hours...WOW! -Paul Pudwell
*
Surprise! After a 2 week absence,
J pod & L87 met up with L12s somewhere around Sooke
and observed 200 meters from shore off Shirley, BC. They were all last seen heading eastbound but no one else reported seeing them and we don't know how far Js/L87 came in or when they split from Ls. -Photo by Haley McLean,

Entry 2:
*
Southern Residents - L Pod L12's at least were last seen off Jordan River heading West at 1 pm
today... -Paul Pudwell
*
Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - How cool is this? Camping at
Salt Creek campground (Olympic Peninsula) and 3 orca
just passed us, eastbound. One male, 2 females, too far for IDs, heard 'L pod', but only 3 whales seen. 2 WW boats with them. -Jill Hein

Case Inlet -
11:50 a.m. - Humpback was at Spencer Cove
(north Harstine Island) at
1150am
, then headed north. -Nick Wenzel.
*
Eastern Juan de Fuca - Humpback spotted off the south end of Lopez Island about 0940
today, 6/14, from our sailboat. It was heading north and east. -Virginia Anderson
*
North Puget Sound - "Orion" BCX1251 -
becoming a local Puget Sounder? Feeling fortunate to be able to watch this particular
Humpback Whale
in our local Puget Sound over what I believe is going on weeks now! From foraging, to deep dive hunting, and what appears to be just plain frolicking... Orion covers all the bases! From
North Edmonds
looking West across PNW's beauitful Puget Sound. (
Facebook video shows who looks to be BCX1251 but ID is unconfirmed - ALB
) -Stu Davidson

Entry 4:
6:00 p.m.
- my wife and I saw
2, maybe 3 whales in Henderson Bay
heading towards the Purdy Spit. We saw them blow and arch out of the water. We live up in Emerald Shores, so, from the distance we saw them (from our back deck), they appeared to not be Orcas, but
possibly Minkes or even Humpbacks
. Behaviors: moving, arching out of the water and spouting. -Dennis Arneson
*
Juan de Fuca -
Lunging humpbacks! Three of them
in the same area today lunge feeding, Strait of Juan de Fuca just
east of Dungeness Spit
. We got mugged by one of them but it was only a fleeting mugging. Never saw flukes because they were lateral lunge feeding. Turns out this is the 2014 calf of
BCY0324-Big Mama
