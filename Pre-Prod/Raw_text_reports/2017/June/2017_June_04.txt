Entry 1:
South Puget Sound -
11:05 a.m. - Single Humpback
cruising north past
Stretch Island at

. Got four good looks at the dorsal fin, definitely not a gray or minke. Traveling. -Rob Dickinson

9:05 a.m. -
Since my initial report, I have seen the
humpback
again heading north. Unfortunately I have to leave soon so I won't be able to see if "Dot" will come back later today. I will be able to share some of my photos later though.

8:15 a.m. - Humpback and common dolphins in Case Inlet
today! (south of Herron Island) I was zooming in on the dolphins and then I noticed something bigger behind them. They both seem to be heading south. -Connor O'Brien

Seeing a
humpback
breach repeatedly off the entrance to

moving north. Close to shore. Can see it all the way from Pier 69! -Jason Miwok

North Puget Sound -
9:11 a.m. -
just saw it again a few minutes ago myself.
Point Jefferson just south of Kingston
. Really been
hanging in this area the last few days
...looked to be about a third of the way across the channel from the west side. I caught it just as it was flukes up doing a deep dive...I just happen to be looking out the window at the right time!! I have noticed a pattern tho, usually 3 surfaces and then goes deep for a bit. And yes, food must be plentiful! -Chris Beamer Otterson
*
Gulf Islands -
We had a nice encounter with
2 humpback whales, BCY0160 Heather and BCX1057 Divot at approximately 3pm
. They cruised along the shoreline of the
Pender Islands
taking 4 minute dives on average with many breaths at the surface. We left them nearing Tilly Pt. Photos attached. We later heard on the radio that the 2 humpbacks headed back toward Mandarte where they had been spending time earlier in the day. -Captains Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing
*
Hood Canal -
1:20 p.m. - Gray Whale in Hood Canal
. This afternoon (4
June 2017; approx.
13:20 hr), a large (adult?)
gray whale swam past our house on Hood Canal
. It was swimming slowly, inside the line of boat mooring buoys, in water less than 25 ft deep, traveling in a NE direction, following the shoreline towards the mouth of the Union River near Belfair. Our house is located at 14xxx E State Route 106,
Belfair
, WA, approximately 5 miles SW of the mouth of the Union River, and approximately 2 miles NE of Twanoh State Park. -Toy Melchiors
*

1:15 p.m. - On Hood Canal
over the weekend we saw what we believe to be
a juvenile Gray Whale
. It was at least 30 feet in length and was dangerously close to the shoreline. It did surface further out later on, and no small dorsal was apparent as would be found in a minke and the tail was too large. Unfortunately we could not get our camera up quickly enough either time....It was heading back toward the mouth of the canal, about a mile from Twanoh State Park on Sunday around 2pm. It was a pretty good surfacing and tail slap. We were concerned that it was sick or lost because it was so close to the shore. Hope it gets out of the Canal OK. -George Means

this afternoon. -Photo by Lori Sparling,
