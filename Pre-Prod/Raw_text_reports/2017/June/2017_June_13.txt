Orca Sightings for June 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
L-Pod hadn't been seen in Haro Strait since
October 28th of last year (our last research encounter of 2016!), but we were hopeful all that would change yesterday with word of
inbound Ls off of Sooke. The majority of the pod turned and went back west, but the L12 sub-group did make it all the way "in" to San Juan Island
. This afternoon we had them in a resting line off Land Bank, part of a nearly 5 hour encounter with them! -Monika Wieland Shields

Some great
calls as some of L pod is passing by Lime Kiln Pt
. and the Lime Kiln hydrophone at

5:55 pm
. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

L22 and L89 came up to Edwards Points
and then turned south again while the
L12s continued north
. They seemed to be resting and milling off the Westside Preserve for the few hours I was there, then finally picked up a bit of speed and
passed Lime Kiln around
4:30.

3:39 p.m. - They're still at Land Bank
going very slowly. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

4:10 p.m. - They're at Lime Kiln
! Got to go to Lime Kiln and catch up as the L12's headed North. Day #2 They arrived yesterday, Monday the 12th, first time since October. -Photo by Cher Renke,

T65A's north of Patos
- We had a incredible encounter with the T65A's about 4 miles north of Patos. Shortly after we arrived, the orcas began hunting a harbor seal. The seal spent quite a bit of time lying at the surface while the orcas powerfully lunged in circles all around him. Lots of tail thrashing by T65A. The predation event lasted 25 minutes. We also recorded some vocalizations while they were eating. We were the only boat on scene. -Cheers, Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

San Juan Islands - Approx.
6:25 p.m. - Humpback
spotted off starboard side of the

North Puget Sound -
4:55 p.m.
- My wife and I were on the 13
June
4:40 pm
Kingston to Edmonds Ferry
and saw several splashes (
multiple whales, at least three
possibly more) at a distance to the north. Couldn't tell what type they were. No breaches, but several fluke slaps and humps. They seemed to be playing, but could possibly have been feeding, too far to tell. Likely gray or humpback? (
Humpback, see report below by Stu Davidson
). -Ross Holcomb
*
Believe this to be
Orion Humpback Whale BCX
1251 that was back-and-forthing for many hours today
between Point No Point and Eglon
east of the shipping lanes. Nothing cooler than a whale-tail waterfall! Update:

5:00pm he's west of North Edmonds
breaching / tail slapping. -Photo by Stu Davidson,

Haro Strait -
11:40 a.m. -
WA State Ferries just reported
a gray (possible humpback?)
whale heading south in Haro Strait in mid channel, across the Sidney route.

, towards Vashon. Could only see tail slaps from the ferry. I thought I saw at least 2. -Kim McCormick Osmond

9:06 a.m. -
I just had a friend text me that they are watching
whales breach off Alki Beach
right now. Asking for more details! He said it looks like more than one but can't tell what kind. -Aubree Mae Renfro
*

8:00 a.m. -
Mike at WS Ferries reports a
probable humpback whale heading south between the Vashon ferry dock and Fauntleroy dock

Pacific white-sided dolphins - We encountered a pod of
about 100 Pacific white-sided dolphins in Queen Charlotte Strait
. They were spread out over the span of a mile at first, actively hunting in the mixing currents. At one point I photographed the dolphins frantically chasing salmon right at the surface! I got a few photos of the salmon being knocked into the air but could not identify exactly which species of salmon they were. After a half hour of feeding they all grouped up and started traveling north together. -Bart Rulon
