Orca Sightings for June 17, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
...
29 members of L pod
present (the L54s, L84, and L88 were not here today) were in one tight group and appeared to be resting. The whales occasionally pointed different directions from southeast to southwest but overall were moving southwest. Dave ended the encounter at
1625 about halfway between Salmon and Hein Banks with L pod
still in one tight group heading slowly southwest. -Full encounter summary & photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 45

Entry 4:
Salmon Bank, the T65Bs and T36As
engaged in hunting a harbor porpoise or, at least, that's what it appeared to be at first. They very easily could have made the kill, but seemed to be either playing with it or having a training session (or both) with the young ones in the group. On several occasions, I observed one of the juveniles on the tail of the porpoise as it came up, while the adults followed slowly behind. Every now and then, the matriarchs and teenagers would engage but the porpoise always resurfaced and kept on going. We
arrived at 1517 and when we left at 1545
, they were still taunting it! -Renee Beitzel

We encountered
T65Bs and 36As
as a tight social group inside
Griffin Bay at 1pm
. Hard to leave, and they continued to follow us as we headed South to see
L pod of the long awaited resident
. Beautiful tight resting group of such significance. They were
heading south towards Hein Bank
when we left them at
4pm
. Then found
within 2.3 miles the Transients (65Bs and 36As)
were fully engaged in predation with a double synchronized breach on two harbor porpoise. (photos below) -Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*
A little video I got on
Saturday
evening while out with Island Adventures. The
T36As and T65Bswere teaching the calf hunting skills with a Harbor Porpoise for at least 40 minutes
. When the moms got tired of playing chase then I started recording! We were south
in Rosario Strait east of Salmon Bank
. -Video by Marcie Barney Goldberg,

We had a double header today! First the
T36As and T65Bs milling in Griffin Bay and off 4th of July Beach,
this morning, and then
L-Pod off the southwest part of San Juan Island this afternoon
. It's always special to see both ecotypes of orcas in the same day, especially from shore! -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Not as dramatic as the breaching whale last year, but this time a pod. There appeared to be
at least 8 visible.
. I believe 2 of them were babies due to their size. They came through the mouth of the river about

7:30 PM
. They went
approx. 1 mile upriver from the mouth (of the Siuslaw River on the central Oregon Coast).
They went back over the bar into the ocean about
8:15 PM and headed north. -Deborah Heldt Cordone

June 17th. Definitely NOT orca..very familiar with orca. We only saw one up close from our boat, other two were in distance off Maury Island. It was a relatively small dorsal fin with spout going up 10 ft or so, size of mid to large orca, kind of lumbered along. -Leah Craig
