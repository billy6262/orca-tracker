We had a great sail on
June 5th with the
T65A's in Boundary Pass
. We witnessed a predation event of a harbor porpoise approximately
2.5 miles SW of Java Islets near 6pm
. After their meal they breached several times, spy hopped, and tail lobbed before traveling towards the Saturna Island shoreline aiming at East Point. It was an epic encounter. -Captains Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

10:56 AM - a probable humpback whale
is tail-lobbing, slapping the water with flukes, repeatedly about 100 yards
off the Fauntleroy ferry
dock in West Seattle.

About
10 a.m. - An active humpback was seen off Pt. Robinson
, Vashon Island. -Jim Hodgson.

7:28 p.m. - Humpback whale sighting in Case Inlet
again along with a bald eagle! We are on Hartstene island. The humpbacks have been
hanging around here for the past 2-1/2 weeks or so
. Breaching some, tail slapping but mostly just cruising along eating fish I think. He makes several passes by sometimes all day back and forth. Doesn't seem to be headed anywhere. -Debbie Canny Wood

9:00 a.m. -
I believe
a Minke
was sighted by multiple viewers around the
3 Tree Point (Burien)
area this morning. Several big arches showing rear dorsal great tail slaps. Was first spotted to the south and was heading north. -Nick Miller
