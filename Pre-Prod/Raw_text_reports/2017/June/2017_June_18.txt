============================================================

Entry 1:
Protection/Gabriola Island, BC
- At approximately
1600 hours
we spotted
a pod of Killer Whales (6 possibly 7 w/Two large males, one baby)
circling off the North end of Protection Island, Nanaimo and then travelling SE along the western side of Gabriola Island along beside sandstone cliffs First they appeared to be feeding as they were circling. Then they travelled SE. -Trudy Chatwin

San Juan Islands - Tonight the T36As and T65Bs
were after harbor seals
near Flattop Island
. Pictured here, one of the juveniles
T36A3
breached as a wary harbor seal tried to get as far up onto the rocks as possible. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

Entry 2:

Today we saw the
T65A's and T73A's
traveling in a tight group west from
Salmon Bank near
3:30pm
. Photos attached. We heard the T65Bs and T36As (presumably) were about 11 miles to the north near Kellett Bluff. -Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

This morning...the T65As and T73As were traveling together in the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca
. In this photo
T65A4
swims with
T73A
and her youngest. The most recent catalogue has T73A2 born in 2010 (who was present but not pictured here) so I'm guessing this would be T73A3. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

Coastal killer whales - This email was sent to me from a
Hatfield
visitor. I wanted to pass it on to you: "Saw your sign requesting info on Orcas. Last Sunday (
June 18) at about

11:00 AM
we spotted
two Orcas
swimming side by side seemingly following a small pod of what I think were grey whales north bound from the casino area to the point at Roads End. The whales were stirring up the sand and rolling at the edge of the breakers very close to shore. The
Orca fins
were unmistakable." -Renee Fowler, Volunteer Coordinator, Visitor Center Assistant Manager, Oregon Sea Grant, OSU Hatfield Marine Science Center, Newport OR

5:30 p.m
. - On Sunday
June 18 my family and I were at
Kalaloch Beach
and witnessed what seemed to be a larger group of orca (
at least 6, possibly including 1 adult male
) At some points 6 to 10 water shoots were spotted coming out from various spots simultaneously. We watched them for about 3 hours. They were in the same location for over 3 hours we were thinking they were playing and eating. We could see side flippers as if they were rolling around. -Jessica Alwed
