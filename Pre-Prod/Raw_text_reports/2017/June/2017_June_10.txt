Entry 2:

The
T2Cs
are currently our resident
Transients
. We met them on our doorstep after leaving them at
East Point
. Reduced sail as their family waits for T2C2, dependent on them and moving very slowly with his condition of Scoliosis. With his slow progress they changed their minds in the flood of Cattle Pass to retrace track to the North. Looked like his family shared the catch of the hunt near Yellow Island. The sunset was amazing. The T2C's are still in our area. -Barbara & David

Synchronicity in the
Strait of Georgia.
We were initially with the
T124A's and T065A's
. Lots of vocalizing and socializing and then we spotted more whales in the distance and as they came together, they started porpoising at high speed!! Lots of interacting after they joined up with the
T101's, T123's, T036A's and T049C
. -Photo by Gary Sutton,

Orca sighting - Active Pass this morning at
9:00 AM
...taken from
Lighthouse Park on Mayne island
looking toward Galiano island. The orca group was going through Active Pass, hugging the coast of Galiano. They then disappeared, probably veering north along Galiano coast. -Photo by Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island, BC, Canada,
