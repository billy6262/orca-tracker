Orca Sightings for June 3, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed north with a report of
orcas near Pt. Roberts, BC
, heading southeast, in our direction. By the time we arrived, the group of
Transients (Biggs)
had split, with 3 or 4 heading west out of range, but one male, beautiful
T101A
, was there for us. He was doing large, erratic circles around the five whale watch boats, surfacing a few times in a line, then reappearing in a completely different area! It was a privilege to share some time with this young (mid-twenties) orca as he went about his daily life. Heading home, we stopped to see the last few big Steller Sea Lions at the east end of Sucia Island, growling and preening. They will leave our area very soon to return north to the Bering Sea. One big eagle was spotted, and an osprey with a large branch for nest building was seen just as we left the marina in the morning. Another lovely day on the Salish Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

10:00 a.m. - I'm seeing the humpback
milling around same general area as Justines report (below) but maybe a bit further to the SW. Saw it fluke then resurface a few minutes later. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

San Juan Clipper encountered
BCX 1251 "Orion" 1.5 miles south of Possession Point
moving slowly south and fluking often. -Justine Buckmaster
*

6:15 a.m. - Pt. Jefferson, Kingston
...standing outside just now taking in the total quiet of this still morning on the water I first heard the blows before I saw them...there are
two humpbacks, one big and one small
. Close to mid channel milling around. -Chris Beamer Otterson

Entry 2:
*

8:34 p.m. - Standing at Glendale Beach we've got a humpback
that just fluked. Feeding. I missed a fluke shot the one time we saw it deep dive but the downtime was short - like 3 minutes. This humpback was traveling the fastest I have ever seen a humpback travel. And just like that it was past us to the south. The water was calm enough to see the footprints and judge where it was going to come up. Sounds like I had a lead humpback and Danielle had a trailer (or two). Traveling closer to Whidbey than Mukilteo - just another Saturday night on Whidbey! -Debbie Stewart
*

5:29 p.m. - Whale spotted between Possession Point park and Mukilteo
, could not ID. It was out in the middle of the channel and seem to be heading North, but hard to tell. -Randy Koch
*

4:17 p.m. -
I see spouts out front again (
Humpback off Point Jefferson
). -Chris Beamer Otterson.

Entry 3:
*

12:00 p.m. - see at least 1 humpback from Sunset Ave in Edmonds
diving, no direction of travel. Literally just beyond the buoys of the dive park and going back and forth in that general area. -Michelle Goll
*
San Juans -
On
June 3rd we hung out with
a humpback whale known as MMY0009 or MMY0001 "Frankenstein" as it headed south from Jones Island mid strait down San Juan Channel
. We left him/her heading south towards Cattle Point at approximately
5pm
. The whale would surface with one or two breaths and go down for about 7 minutes before re-surfacing. -Captains Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Hood Canal -
8:45 a.m. - Dabob Bay
, Hood Canal Whale Sighting.
Gray Whale off Bolton Peninsula,
Dabob Bay, (Quilcene), WA. 500 feet East of Quilcene Bay channel marker. Hopefully trying to get the hell away from all the Saturday shrimp fishing small boat traffic! S/he was only a couple hundred feet off the South tip of Bolton Peninsula (separates Quilcene Bay and Dabob Bay) swimming West, towards the channel marker. No pics, but a forever memory. S/he was 20 ft off my port bow, heading the opposite direction. -Brian Simmons
*
We saw him [
gray whale
] again on Sunday, heading east towards
Belfair
again. He did not come completely out of the water, but significantly breached the surface and flipped his tail completely out of the water. -Janene Johnson (8800 block of East State Route 106, Union ,WA)
*

7:00 p.m. - The pod of Common dolphins remained in Case Inlet
into the evening.
