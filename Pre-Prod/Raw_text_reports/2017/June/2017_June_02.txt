Entry 3:

Sailing the extra nautical mile we met
Transient Orcas, T65A's, within sight of Vancouver
. As we approached
two humpback whales breached
about a mile ahead of the orcas. Returned by way of East Point and found 2 Peregrine Falcons. Evening light by Flattop began painting the picture of sunset. -Barbara and David
*
Coastal killer whales - Received a call at

1:40PM
from Ivy Reynolds, manager of the gift shop at
Cape Meares OR Lighthouse
at the same time
three orcas were about 1-2 miles offshore
from the lighthouse, heading north.
Two were adult males
. She also said that Travis Korb took a video of a predation event a few days ago from Cape Lookout in which orcas separated a gray whale mom from a calf, then chased the calf to the beach where it stranded, until the the adult gray whale chased the orcas away. The calf was not on the beach soon thereafter.

4:30 p.m. - It is a humpback.
Currently near the
entrance to Totten Inlet
. It was logging on the surface for some time until it was startled by a barge and started moving again. Traveling slightly north then turning and going south. Cascadia Research has been notified. (Kim ID'd this humpback as the same one, "DOT", who was in Hammersley and Case Inlets the past 5-6 weeks). -Kim Merriman

We saw a whale (
humpback
?) that hung around for hours (about
1 pm to evening
) near
Windy Point/Steamboat Island
and points south
in Totten Inlet
. The whale jumped out of the water about 4 times and smacked its tail several times, other times just seem to float. What a treat!
(
This was confirmed
humpback
included in our previous Whale Sighting Report -ALB
) -Knackstedt

12:30 p.m. - A whale, possibly juvenile humpback
is headed west towards
Carlyon Beach/ Steamboat Island
. I could only watch from afar - would love to hear for sure what it is. Honestly I had just come up from a dive minutes prior and heard a loud blow. I watched it with binoculars from afar and am certain of whale, but not species. Definitely solitary. -Nick Wenzel
