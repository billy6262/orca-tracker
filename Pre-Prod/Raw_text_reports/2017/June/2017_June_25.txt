2:20 p.m. -
Northbound... Really close at
Land Bank. Majority at Lime Kiln.
Social, resting behavior...dorsal slap? 5 off Deadman's Bay. -Cher Renke
*

2:23 p.m - All north of Land Bank now.

12:30 p.m. - 3 northbound at Land Bank
now, very spread and continuing north.

12:25 p.m. - Seeing some blows at Edwards Pt
but not north of there
as J-Pod and the K14s made their way north
. -Monika Wieland Shields
*
This is
L87 Onyx, J35 Tahlequah, and J47 Notch
. It was a bit rolly out there on the water yesterday, but
J pod and the K14's
were still here! Hopefully, that is a positive sign that there are salmon here for them. A few more Chinook being counted at the Fraser River, so that's also a better sign in the short term. Time will tell how long these guys stay in our inland waters and if other Southern Resident Killer Whale pods come into the area. -Report & photo by Traci Walter,

Been listening to calls on
OrcaSound hydrophone
for a while.

2:17 p.m. -
Looked like some real nice close passes at the light via webcam.

loud echolocation and some calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone. Boats coming into view on the webcam. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

The beloved
J46 Star passing Lime Kiln
southbound with the rest of her clan. Sadly this is her first summer without her mom J28 Polaris who died last year. Her younger brother J54 who was not old enough to eat on his own also died. J46 did her best to keep him alive in the days after their momma passed. It is good to see her. -Photo by Robyn Cartwright,

Gorgeous early morning with
Jpod and the K14's!
. An early start to the morning because
J pod and the K14's were coming past Lime Kiln State Park
! A gorgeous calm morning out there! These guys were going against a very strong ebb tide. I hope these guys continue to find Chinook Salmon. Counts at the Fraser River haven't been very good. So much work needs to be done to restore the salmon runs in the Salish Sea. Everyone needs to commit to major actions for the salmon or we will loose this precious community of Killer Whales, the Southern Residents. -Video by Traci Walter,

The
Js and K14s did a good old fashioned Westside Shuffle, passing the westside of San Juan Island 4 times throughout the day
. Here's a shot from their first trip north in the early morning as J26 Mike did a half breach in front of the Olympic Mountains. -Report & photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Great way to start the day, listening to them & seeing them on the web cam while drinking my morning cup of coffee. -Jacqueline Slaughter.

Entry 10:
Sunshine Coast, BC -
5:45 p.m. - Orcas off Wilson Creek, south of Davis Bay, Salish Sea, south of Sechelt. Saw two orcas
approx 250 yds. offshore at

Entry 11:
Neah Bay
, we had an encounter with
a small Orca pod
. There were
5 total
. They were heading out west, turned back around then headed back out west out of the straits. The encounter happened in the morning around
8 or 9 am
. We where excited to get the chance to see this beautiful pod of Transients...These photos were taken with my zoom lens and we were in the safe zone for most the encounter until they decided to change directions.. By the time we realized what they did, it was too late to start our motor and move away from them. -Sandra Watne

Finally caught up with the
orcas in Discovery Bay

Gardiner Beach

now. Heading out. It looked like west a bit. Around what ever island is that way. -Corinne Jones

playing and breeching. Two adults maybe more. Incredible sight to see here in
Discovery Bay

Worldmark Resort

My friend who lives at

Hi we were at
Beckett Point
in Discovery Bay today at about
10am
, very low tide, where we had the pleasure of watching five (we think) orca feeding for about half an hour. Four adults and a juvenile. Amazing because they were so close, sometimes not ten feet from where we were standing! (

Out in my boat by
Carkeek Park
just north of Shilshole Marina on Sunday 6/25/17. Sighted a young humpback feeding. Stuck around for about 60 minutes and continued to blow air and dive every few minutes exposing the tail. It was a wonderful experience. -Tom Donahue

Saw something from the
Bremerton ferry
around 1015. We saw a tail, so it may actually have been a
humpback
(reported as orca). It looked as though it was heading south. -Kristen Sanborn
