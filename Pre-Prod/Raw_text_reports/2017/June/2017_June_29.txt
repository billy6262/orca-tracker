7:44 p.m. -
tuned into
Lime Kiln hydrophone and was hearing echolocation
under boat noise. A few minutes later started
hearing calls
and watched few whales pass northbound on the webcam. By

8:15pm a few more on the webcam
. For the next hour listened in heard mostly
S1
calls, with some whistles, and a lot of echolocation. At

8:40pm I switched over to Orca Sound for a few minutes heard faint calls
, one of which was same descending call as first heard on Lime Kiln when I tuned in at
7:44pm. Back on Lime Kiln at

8:44pm there was a repeating S2 call
. Back on
OS at
8:55 heard quite a few calls from both Js & Ks.
Through out this time on both hydrophones heard
S1, S2, S6, and K calls
. At

9:22 pm there were still audible vocals on Lime Kiln
. Later on Orca Sound heard an array of calls: S1, S3, S10s, S16 and S17s and echolocation. At
10:05pm I made note of really nice loud
vocals on OS in mostly quiet seas and have phone recordings time stamped at
10:10pm
, I stopped listening just after that. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

June 29: On a gorgeous summer day, we caught up with the leaders of the
Southern Resident group around Salmon Bank
. They were actively fishing, with many turns and erratic surfacing. We had wonderful looks at big male
K26 Lobo, his mom K14 Lea
, as well as
some of J pod
, including one of the calves born in 2015. And the end of our time with them, a large group started surfacing together in the brilliant sunshine, which was absolutely beautiful! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

Had such a great day today on the water with an approach and close pass by the
