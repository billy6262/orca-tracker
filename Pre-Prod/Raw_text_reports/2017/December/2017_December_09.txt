1:32 p.m. -
Marilyn Armbruster and I took
1:15 ferry and got surrounded by orcas midchannel and west. Literally everywhere. Still NW bound, spread out, north of ferry lanes. I headed to
Bush Pt
to catch a glimpse of the residents as they headed north and met up with Marilyn. Since they were on the other side, we decided to hop the
ferry (Keystone to Port Townsend)
to try to catch them. Our timing couldn't have been better as the
ferry was surrounded by whales everywhere. L92 Crewser
cruising upper Admiralty Inlet w/ other members of L and K pods. This is why I live here, the whales, and people still think I'm kidding. I'm not. Thankful for other orca dorks who just get it. -Rachel Haight

At around
noon today orcas were nearing Bush Point
, we could see them from afar, they were on the side of Marrowstone Island, met up with my pals Ashley, Kate and Rachel... Rachel and I left to go to Fort Casey and on a whim and trying to time the orcas from where they were, we hopped a

1:15 Port Townsend Ferry
. WOW, lucky....so lucky. I have never had this happen before where we were surrounded by orcas on a ferry. Amazing...Rachel and I then turned back around and caught the next ferry back. incredible orca blessed day! -Marilyn Armbruster

I went up to
Marrowstone Point
and watched them pass through northbound heading out of
Admiralty Inlet between
12:30 and
1:40
ish...Observed foraging, traveling, porpoising, pec slapping, tail lobbing, breaching. Heard a couple of those pec slaps! This is a bit hazy but, still... a joy to see them! -Donna Van Renselaar
