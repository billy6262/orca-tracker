Bigg's/Transient killer whales -

Entry 2:
11:45 a.m. - Orcas seen at East Point Saturna Island
. This morning we had a treat to see a group of orcas swim by
East Point
. They swam south bound from the Georgia Strait and into Boundary Pass right along Boiling Reef and the shore line. There were at least three: two adults and a juvenile. Not sure if they were resident or Biggs. The seals and sea lions seemed to be behaving strangely while they were there. -Jason Garratt

7pm
they can now be heard faintly on
Orcasound
.

6:20 p.m. -
Hearing
calls on Lime Kiln Hydro
, can anyone verify please? Hard to tell who though, I've heard a couple blows, and some clicking and something that sounded
more like a humpback
than orca, but also squeals that sound like orca. -EJ Evans
