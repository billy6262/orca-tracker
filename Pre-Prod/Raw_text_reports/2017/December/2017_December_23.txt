2:13 p.m. - Out from Presidents Point, Kingston
still meandering southbound as they forage for food.

1:38 p.m. - Orcas are very spread out
. So far just seeing
K13s
engaging in a lot of fishing! Circling, zig zagging, lunging as they go after salmon.
K25 and few others, including K27 and son K44
were mostly more towards mid channel with K34 closer to Kitsap. K25 would cruise westward, then head back towards west of mid channel. K25 partaking in much lunging!
On one occasion one of the younger whales was after a fish and K25 came hauling from the east, and lunged after the salmon, then headed back off towards mid channel again. All this going on while trending very slowly southbound out off Edmonds/Kingston, all keeping to west side of the Sound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
Members of
K pod
trending southbound very spread out chasing salmon off
Kingston/Edmonds
area on this gorgeous frigid winter day. Matriarch K13 died earlier this year so it was especially meaningful to spend time with the K13s surrounded by the snow-capped Cascade and Olympic Mountains. Only individuals we could confirm were from the K13s:
K25 Scoter
was partaking in a lot of chasing and lunging today along with
K38 Comet and his mom K20 Spock
. Little
K44 Ripple
(born 2011, not so little anymore) and his mom
K27 Deadhead
swimming and foraging together. And a nice peek at
K34 Cali
every so often. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network,

12:43 p.m. -
The Chilkat Express and the Island Explorer are both off of
Eglon and Rose Point
. Some blows and splashes but hard to tell any definite direction, though probably south. They are 3/4 of the way across the channel from Edmonds (on the Kingston side). Hard to tell just what or how many because the water is so choppy with whitecaps... -Steve Marczewski
