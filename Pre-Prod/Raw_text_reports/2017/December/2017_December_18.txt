Entry 2:
December 18th of two families of Bigg's/Transients hunting a harbor seal in Mendocino, California. From multiple videos and still images, Alisa Schulman-Janiger, California Killer Whale Project, recognized the T137s & thought the T36Bs (T36B1 was later confirmed by Jared Towers, DFO ). These two matrilines are "exotics" to that area since they are usually seen through out the Salish Sea and WA & BC coasts! Alisa say they have no prior known documented sightings of them down there.
Video narrative: " What caught my attention was an orca leaping VERTICALLY over a complete body length completely out of the water. This was followed by a smaller flying object, which I soon discovered, was a harbor seal. The seal had probably been tossed around by the whales. I went closer to investigate and noticed the seal on the surface, apparently stunned. It swam over to my boat and tried several times to climb aboard while the group of orcas circled around it." -Mike Kitahara
