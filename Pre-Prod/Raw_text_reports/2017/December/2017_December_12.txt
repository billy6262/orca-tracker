Entry 2:

I saw your post about them
nearing Cultus Bay
. I ran down there a little before

4:00pm
. I knew they were out there as 2 PSE linemen and one linewoman were standing there looking straight out. There were
4 of them
. The mountains, the water, the orca, truly serene. Resident orcas at sunset backdropped by Kitsap Peninsula. I was standing at Scatchet Head beach at the end of Driftwood Lane looking over towards maybe Eglon, Kitsap. One of the PSE working at the end of that road was captured by the sunset and the 4orcas. Taken from Scatchet Head, Whidbey Island. -Marilyn Armbruster

3:25 p.m. -
The majority of the pods appeared to have headed NW while at least one family and one of the males headed due north directionally
towards Possession Point
. The others we could see for the past hour disappearing from sight. The only ones we see currently are south of Possession Point (sightline Sunset Ave, Edmonds to Cultus Bay, Whidbey) A
t least one adult male northbound
with several others closer to shore milling off Whidbey. I think the pods are just spread out between South Whidbey and Admiralty. Viewed from Sunset Ave, north of Edmonds Ferry. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

About
2:45 p.m. - I saw 3 or 4 Orcas pass the Edmonds Marina heading north

I just got home, but wanted to add that yes,
2 bottlenose dolphins were seen off Constellation Park around
11:20
, then they turned and were parallel from shore of Alki beach, h
eading towards Elliott Bay around
11:35
, then proceeded to head towards Magnolia. I drove to Jack Block, but they did not come that way - must have continued towards Magnolia. Sorry no photos, but saw them close enough to see that these are the 2 bottlenose we've been seeing lately. -Annika Bowden
