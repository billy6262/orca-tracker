Orca Sightings for December 28, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
approaching Victoria this evening, after an amazing encounter with the T49As
- who were predating on a harbor seal - when we stumbled upon
15 or more killer whales (T36As, T36Bs, T137s and likely another group)
! Interestingly,
two of these matrilines were sighted in Mendocino last week
. On this day, they were in pursuit of a large male Steller sea lion seeking refuge near the boat. The hunt continued for close to half an hour, before we slowly motored away and watched as the killer whales closed in on the exposed sea lion. A fascinating display of power! In compliance with whale watching guidelines. -Brendon Bissonette, Eagle Wing Naturalist

Spotted a group of
orcas
from the bow of the M V Coho while traveling towards Port Angeles around

4:45 pm
. They were moving northwest and I would guess there were at least 6 in the group, though I am not a trained observer. I had binoculars and could see them quite clearly. We were much closer to Vancouver Island than Port Angeles. There was a whale watching boat in the vicinity. One leaped vertically out of the water, others were rolling, slapping tails onto the water. No camera available. Many other people saw them. -Ruth Brede
