============================================================

Entry 1:
Ks & Ls
- Finally spotted them
1 mile south of Bush Pt.
on the deep dusk, heading south, closer to the Whidbey side, could hear their blows thrpugh the crisp air! Watched/listened from about

4:55 to
5:10
, then too dark and cold but they are likely still streaming by....They were heading SE in Admiralty Inlet, at dark they were about at the Hood Canal entrance - so they likely kept going then either went south toward Seattle or north up Possession Sound and Saratoga Passage. Hopefully we'll get reports tomorrow morning! -Susan Berta

I took a drive up to Ft Flager and finally spotted the orcas travelling

1:55 pm. - About 2 miles east of Protection Island
& 2 miles west of Port Townsend. 10-12 whales. They were moving west towards the entrance of Discovery Bay. At least 3 big ones & one calf included in the above numbers. Also, they weren't moving fast. Lots of playing. Also hunting formations noted. Prolonged periods of 4-5 whales abreast only 1-2 meters apart moving 2-4 knots on the surface and then stopping yet remaining unsubmerged. Over a 45 minute period, they only moved about 1-2 miles. Most amazing encounter I have ever had by far. -William Westrem
