4:33 p.m. -
I've counted at least 15 headed back east. From Tahlequah... At first it looked like they were foraging in the rip, but not one of them that I saw turned back
towards the Narrows or Colvos
. -Holly Bailey

4:29 p.m. -
Seeing foraging behavior in the
Pt. Defiance Channel
.

3:45 p.m. -
still spread out crossing/Milling Quartermaster Harbor towards
Pt. Defiance

3:27 p.m. -
Some breaching their way across entrance to Quartermaster Harbor heading for
Pt. Defiance
, they are spread out all along southern end of Maury Island. -Melissa Burke

A breaching orca and a WS ferry. I headed to Dash Point around
2:30 then over to Browns Point...from high bank at
Browns Point
could see many orcas pretty much spread out across the sound. I couldn't get any closer but it was nice to see them from afar.

1:52 p.m. -
I am seeing whales heading south. Some are right off of.
Robinson
And they stretch all the way across the channel towards what I would guess would be Dash point or saltwater state park? There is a research boat out there. They seem to be meandering in an easterly direction.

1:48 p.m. -
I am seeing another group right off
Point Robinson
. Maybe half a dozen?

1:41 p.m. -
I also just spotted a male heading south, but farther behind the first group so it looks to me as if there are two groups? I am viewing this from Normandy Park 219th St., on the bluff at the end of the road.

1:39 p.m. -
So, I think I'm seeing maybe around five? It's hard to tell maybe one male? It appears that there might be a research boat out there with him right in the midst of it all they are spread out between the Point Robinson marker and the yellow channel marker off of Des Moines's area. They are kind of just milling around, but maybe with a more easterly direction.

1:26 p.m. -
I am watching them from
Des Moines
. It looks to me as if they have turned around and are heading in a north direction, but maybe more towards the Des Moines's marina area. -Tanya Esparza
