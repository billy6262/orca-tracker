Orca Sightings for December 31, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
T75s (including two new calves)
wasn't our last orca sighting of 2017 after all! This afternoon the
T18s turned up in Haro Strait. Here's T19B Galiano
, a huge male impressive from any distance, as seen from San Juan County Park. Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, OBI,

Final trip of the season was a blast! It was freezing, but the sun was out and we had a lot of enthusiastic passengers aboard!! We traveled up to San Juan Island where we caught up with the
T18's and 19's
, a transient matriline that I have not seen since earlier this season! Always a pleasure spending time with this family that we so rarely ever see. Was nice to close the season out with them.
T19B
has a fresh/new notch and rake marks. These are some of my faves from today! Renee Beitzel
