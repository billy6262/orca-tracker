7:20 p.m. -
Just prior to dusk I saw a large whale off
Arroyo Beach in West Seattle
. It was traveling north, fast. Close to shore, maybe 100-150 yards off shore. I could clearly see it surface and hear it exhale several times before it showed its fluke and then went under water and out of view. I don't know if it was a grey or humpback, it had a small dorsal fin. (The small dorsal fin along with the rest of the description sounds like a humpback.) -Jennifer Barwick
*

2:00 p.m. -
Hi Orca Network, Two friends and I were sailing through
Colvos passage
and encountered a whale coming into the pass around two pm. It surfaced right next to us, and we sailed behind it for a while as it headed south. We initially thought it was a gray, but then it began lob-tailing repeatedly in a few different spots which I have heard
is a common humpback behavior
. Now were confused. Unfortunately none of us got a great look at it's back; it surfaced too close it shocked all of us! Any thoughts? Thanks! Additional: Thank you so much!
I thought I saw a dorsal fin
but was honestly too excited to say for sure. We first encountered the whale
between Ollala and Fragraria
. Our friends on another boat saw it from a distance at the south end of the pass, so it was definitely traveling south. Also I was thinking humpback because it came up and went down with a very curved motion -Kelly Greenwood
*
Unidentified whales - I believe there is
a small whale in Rich Passage across from South Beach in front of the Manchester Fuel tanks at 9 a.m.
-Deborah Schenk
(
Possibly the
humpback whale
who showed up southbound in Colvos later in the day -ALB
)
