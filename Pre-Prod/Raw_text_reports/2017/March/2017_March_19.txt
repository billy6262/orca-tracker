Sighted
5 Orcas at Cypress Head
- Today,
March 19, at approximately

1:00pm I sighted a pod of 5 Orcas, including one young Orca, but no Males, off Cypress Head
which is on the east side of Cypress Island. I was in my boat and I deployed my hydrophone so I was able to listen and observe the Orcas for almost 2 hours. Two noteworthy observations were: 1) They remained stationary at the surface in a tight group for several minutes prior to diving for an extended period of time; 2) One or more of the whales lifted the young Orca, which was belly up, almost completely out of the water.... I don't think it was a newborn due to it's larger size and coordinated movements. I also believe that the Orcas were being playful when it was lifted. The action was so dramatic however that it caught the attention of crab fisherman that were picking up crab pots just south of Cypress Head. ... I had listened to the signature calls of the local pods during Scott Veirs "Friends of Skagit Beaches" lecture this past Friday, these whales sounded different. Observed for nearly 2 hours, they appeared to be feeding at Cypress Head for an hour. In addition they played, spy hopped, and tail slapped while they appeared to be resting. There was an approximate -2.2 knot current at that time. I have frequently observed Harbor Porpoise in this same area however I did not observe any porpoise today. I have multiple photos. (
ID notes from Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "Looks like the
T36s and T99s
again."

What a glorious day to be on the water with a couple of our visiting gray whales
#53 (Little Patch) and #56,
traveling in tandem southwards in Saratoga Passage,
passing Langley and the Whale Bell
(hope somebody rang it) on their way. Warm sunshine and calm sea conditions enhanced a wonderful wildlife experience as we watched these magnificent creatures glide with grace and ease in their natural environment. A truly unforgettable trip in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
