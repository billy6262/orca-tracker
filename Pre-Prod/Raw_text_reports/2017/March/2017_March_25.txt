Entry 2:

Transients frolicking after a seal kill in San Juan Channel
on
March 25th. -Mark Malleson
*
I understand in addition to the
T46s, the T36s and T99s
were present. T36B1 gave me an ID challenge as her notch appears to be quite large compared to the slit it looks like in the ID guide. I wasn't on scene yet but when the T99s arrived there was a
greeting ceremony observed by CWR
so I'll be keeping an eye out for their encounter report! I believe it was T36D with the sea snake but will be looking for pics from others to confirm and get an idea who was the object of his affection.

2:30 p.m. - peeled off from them still heading south in San Juan Channel
. Very social behaviors, backlit blows, vitamin D, incredible.

1:50 p.m. - In San Juan Channel heading towards Friday Harbor with the T46s

Saratoga Passage - Approx.

4:00 pm we started seeing blows across Saratoga out from Cama Beach
. The gray steadily made it's way directionally towards Hidden Beach, (Greenback, Whidbey). We watched him continue towards Hidden Beach then make a turn
just after
5:00pm
where as he started heading towards southeasterly towards us on the bluffs just south of Baby Island. Around
5:50pm we went back over to the bluffs and could see the blows of now 2 grays heading right for us. They steadily made their way a few hundred yards apart from one another with
#49 reaching the shores below us first around
6:30
. We had about an hour of watching
#49 and #56 rolling around to feed
just under and a little to the south of us, making a lot of disturbance in the water as they rolled around digging up shrimp in the mud during high tide. Very cool to watch the relationships between these animals as the scoters and other birds move in and take advantage of the food stirred up by the whales. -Marilyn Armbruster, Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
