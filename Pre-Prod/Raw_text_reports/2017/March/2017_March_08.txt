... Since it looked like more whales were on the Canadian side, "Orcinus" worked its way west.
J35 and J47
were photographed together about mid-strait. To the northwest of them,
J41, J51, and J46
were together in a group. The J36s were to the west of this group and more single animals could be seen spread out to the west of Kelp Reef. The J41s and J46 headed southwest toward
Sea Bird Point and passed the Kelp Reef marker
by less than a hundred yards... -Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 22
(As always amazing photos in CWR's report, including a beauty of J46 whose on everyone's mind since losing both her mom J28 and brother J54 this past Fall)

Beautiful film of
J pod in Haro Strait
; and other animals of the Salish Sea. -Traci Walter

Our excitement was through the roof today! We had our first trip of the year on the Western Prince II. It was a pretty chilly day but nice conditions on the water. Just before we boarded we got word that some orcas were sighted from shore. It turned out there were more and it was
J pod
! What an incredible treat to see these guys at this time of year. We were also lucky to see many Bald Eagles, Steller Sea lions, a host of different birds, and exotic hoofed animals on
Speiden Island
. -Traci Walter)

Anyone who knows me well knows I absolutely adore
L87 Onyx
. So I was very happy to have spent a little time with him today along with the rest of J Pod (Onyx spent the entirety of our encounter in the company of J27 Blackberry). I know I share a lot of pictures of this gorgeous guy...AND here's one more! (see below) Awesome first trip of the season aboard the Western Prince southbound Haro Strait along with the rest of J pod! -Katie Jones, Naturalist

Magic happens when
J-pod
is in the area and Captain Spencer gets a chance to hand over the helm and pick up his camera. Check out these amazing shots taken just a couple hours ago! (around noon) The report is that the whales were actively foraging but obviously they were feeling a little social today as well! -Maya's Legacy WW

Kiki (J53) is her mom's (Princess Angeline (J17)

6:30 p.m. - Gray whale
. I live near
Kayak Point Park
and saw a gray whale feeding. Moving slowly back and forth not far off shore. 1/2 mile north of park. -Bill Vingelen
