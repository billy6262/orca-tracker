Orca Sightings for March 21, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:25 p.m. -
A special treat to have
J Pod, including J41 Eclipse, two-year-old J52 Sonic, and J52's uncle J26 Mike heading west past Sooke
today! Had reports of killer whales near Race Rocks from a friend fishing so I headed out for a look and as I passed Secretary Island I seen a few blows in the distance and another Whale Watching vessel headed my way. I was able to document a few of the many whales in the area. They were well spread out from shore to traffic lanes feeding heavily. Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal

Biggs killer whales (Transients) - About
3:20 pm
- while tracking the pod (who last surfaced nearing Jefferson Head a few minutes ago) I Got pleasantly distracted by
a humpack surfacing a few hundred yards from shore at Richmond Beach
Saltwater Park & lost track of the orcas. Could not find them again, nor anyone else...

3:08 p.m. the pods have passed yellow mid channel buoy that sits between Kingston and Jefferson Head, Indianola
. Orcas are still well on Kitsap side, medium steady pace southbound. They've been nicely grouped together this whole time. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Stunning VIDEO by Kiro News 7 crew who took to the skies and found the
orcas just south of Kingston around
2:30pm
.

2:30 p.m. -
They were still heading
southbound about 15 minutes ago from Kingston
. One male, probably 6-8 females and some babies. They paused briefly several times on the way down from Eglon. There was one very nice breach by the male. Down times of 3-5 minutes at times. Handsome big guy T11A towers over his travel companions anywhere he goes. Today he was in Puget Sound, surfacing near Kingston, close to Kitsap Peninsula side. -Sara Frey

Definitely on west side and believe still southbound.

1:15 p.m. - see them just about at Eglon

Coastal killer whales -
March 21 - Brookings Harbor/Chetco River, Oregon: Orca Sighting: My partner Terry and I were treated to an observation of
multiple Killer Whales (6-8, including 1 or 2 adult males) in what appeared to be a feeding frenzy just off the beach at Brookings/Harbor at the mouth of the Chetco River about noon on 3-21-17
. We went back the next day and found that they had left the area. We sat in our truck and watched as this activity continued for about one hour. During this time we observed what appeared to be some kind of herding activity as the Orcas were in a circle about fifty yards across and at one point closing in on whatever prey they had targeted. There appeared to be a number of different sizes of Orca from very small to large with some dorsal fins as much as three to four feet out of the water with some white showing at the base of the fins. Due to rain there were few humans around to enjoy this awesome site. They appeared to be feeding in groups of three or more working together. -James Cone
*
Humpback whales -
3:20 p.m. -
while watching the Bigg's across Puget Sound
a humpback surfaced a few hundred yards off shore from my location at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
. Surfaced a few times trending southbound, last time just north of the weather buoy off the beach, then dissappeared. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
Suzanne Gordon reports seeing the
humpback surfacing while steady southbound starting about
3:00 p.m. off Richmond Beach
.
*
More from Toby: I can definitely confirm the
Humpback
Scott saw! We were working nearby:) at the time the very south end of possession bar and whale (and Scott) were west of us... We moved northeast of where Scott was to
east side of Possession
(20-30 minutes later) and then saw spouts in by shore several hundred yards
east of Cultus Bay
and between green can and shore. I cannot confirm it was a grey but seemed too soon to be the same Humpback we had seen earlier. The spouts looked like a possible grey but again we were a little too far away for me to be certain. Unless there are two humpbacks near south whidbey? I will keep a lookout this next week! Thanks for all you do love the site!

1:50 p.m. - Grey whale close to shore just southwest of Possession point!
I am a ways away but it is inside green can and just west
almost to Cultus Bay. We saw the Humpback first at south west possession bar
(west of bar a bit) headed south and the second whale 20-30 minutes after a couple miles away inside the green can on north east possession. I do know Humpback are fast tho! -Toby Black
*

1:44 p.m. - Humpback off of Possession Point and 10 or so orcas transients
. Id'd T11s so far. Almost to Apple cove Point. -Scott Jacobson
