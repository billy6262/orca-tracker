Orca Sightings for May 1, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
What a lovely evening...in between some of the most glorious hours of stormy weather, to hear and see this super pod. I saw a seal very close to shore once the thunder and lightning and rain had moved north. Wondered why. It wasn't 3 minutes later when the calm turned to a chorus of blows punctuated with rows of whales moving with a purpose into
Eld Inlet
....It was the most FABULOUS storm. EVER. I loved all 6+ hours of it. After the orca left during the break in such wildness, the storm started all over again. It seemed totally magical that they showed up in this carved off hour of magic...Here are a few other images as they were heading north out of Eld. There were so many of them it was hard to tell where to shoot. These are all from my beach. The only sounds were of a few way off squeals and the 'Oh My God" from others. Then the beginning sounds of water and breath breaking the surface before it blasted through the silence with such force and stuttered fashion. Each whale bursting forth. So incredible. After the swam off into the misty fog bank, we were greeted by failing light and another round of fireworks in the sky. But they were off traveling somewhere into northern water. -Kim Merriman (see photos below)

11:00-Noon - Orca sighting in Hammersley today! 5 Orcas
in Hammersley! We were about 2 miles up the Inlet from Arcadia Point. They cruised past us going west, up inlet against tide, 11am. An hour later, we saw them coming back toward us, headed east with tide back out toward Squaxin. Not sure if they hung a left north up Pickering or a right south toward Dana Passage. Definitely one large male, maybe two smaller males, then perhaps two females..? Travelling, on a mission. Moving fast up inlet against tide, then cruised past us on way out with tide. Breaching (surfacing) only to breathe, no playfulness at all. -Adam Stocks

, they headed down Totten (Inlet). -Susan Morgan

8:52 a.m. -
They came quickly through the inlet
into Shelton...stayed a short time
- did some "celebrating" (breeching / tail slapping) and slowly headed back out the inlet. (Looked like 2 females, each with a baby alongside.) I'm near Walker Park...-Becky Wilson

Looks like they're just hanging out at the north tip of the island. Must be having a good dinner.

(
Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research looked through all of Chris Hamilton's photos (some included below) here are her ID notes: "I am thinking it was at least the
T100s, T124Ds, T86As, and the T101s. Maybe some T124As
are in there too but I am not sure yet."
)

Approx
11:45 a.m. - I was out on a boat there were about 30 heading south on the east side of Anderson island
... they were everywhere it was amazing. It looked they split into a couple groups right after Anderson island (pin drop shows split at south end Harstine) I was shocked to see how many there were it was beautiful. They had at least 2 babies in their pod...I'm pretty positive I saw jigsaw super long jagged dorsal fin (probably T86A3) ... When they split the group that went left had a baby, two HUGE males, and a couple females all close together. The other group also had a baby maybe two, and more females than males. They started gravitating closer to shore by Anderson island. I didn't see which way the one that looked like jigsaw went. They were moving pretty quickly. -Jami Cantrell

Entry 6:
Juan de Fuca
- It was a long haul but in the end it paid off with
a humpback whale and the T46Bs south of Sheringham
