I was at
Lime Kiln Park today around 1pm. A pod of about 6-8 transients passed
by heading north moving rather swiftly, deep dives, prolonged underwater time. They were be followed closely (perspective from shore) by a large number of whale watching boats. Appeared to be 1 or 2 males and a baby in the group. -Martha Carlstead

12:45 p.m. - A pod of 7/8 orcas just passed close to shore on Ruston way in Tacoma
@ dukes Chowder House heading Southwest. They were heading out of the bay towards the Narrows Vashon Island. (
reported as orcas but we had no other reports on this clear, calm day.
Most likely this was been porpoise or dolphins
and Katie was uncertain about species- ALB
) -Katiedawn Vine

Case Inlet - S/he was off Jarrelys cove. Inside passage of Stretch island
...on the west side of Harstien Island. We spent all afternoon watching this humpback? Feeding and playing. He was hugging the shore for most of the time. When we left, he headed to the North Point Park and was heading east. -Lisa Wiksten

Admiralty Inlet -
1:43 p.m. - Minke whales near Port Townsend
, heading North near lighthouse. And
2 other minkes by Partridge Bank
. Also, encountered
T087 and possibly T124A's by Salmon Bank
. -Janine Harles

Case Inlet -
4:00 p.m. - Minke Whale sighting North Pickering Passage, off Harstine Island
. It was a lone Minke, surfacing frequently, traveling in a meandering route first south through Pickering, then turning north and passing close to Dougall Point before heading east to Case Inlet. Once in Case Inlet, it took a series of much longer dives, apparently feeding. I'm pretty confident this was a Minke. I was in my kayak and had a pretty close look at it. It was not a terribly large whale (a bit bigger than on Orca), black or dark grey. When it surfaced, it exposed just the arc of its back, showing a small dorsal fin about 2/3 towards its rear. It never breached entirely or exposed its tail.when it dove. The whale tended to surface several times in fairly rapid succession, then would dive for longer periods. We've seen this whale (or another one like it) around here off and on since late April. I hope that helps. -Paul Murphy

This morning. No whales....YET! But there have to be
at least 2 dozen harbor porpoise
in various areas of the bay. Some are feeding. Some are simply traveling from place to place. All of that on glassy water so they look so much larger than the are. And it's so silent, you can hear them not only breathe, but some make a sort of 'squeak' when they surface. -Photo by Kim Merriman
