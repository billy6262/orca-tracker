Sometimes, rarely - the curiosity is mutual. After paralleling the
T123s
for half an hour, they surfaced after an 8 minute dive right behind us. We cut our engines and five year-old
T123C Lucky
came over to check us out, never breaking the surface of the water. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

T123 "Sidney"
(pictured) and her kids,
T123A "Stanley" and T123C "Lucky"
, were showing us humans just how powerful they were as they harassed a Steller sea lion. What a sight it was to behold! -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu

This is a family group known as the
T123's
which consists of a
32-Year-old Mother (Sidney) and her two kids, T123A a 17-year-old male (Stanley), and T123C her 5-year-old daughter(Lucky)
. They were traveling along when suddenly everything changed when they pursued a large Steller Sea lion. This is the video from that scene. Lots of aerial action today. In the video, you can sometimes see the sea lion. It did not appear that they finished or ate the sea lion and after the attack, they quickly moved out of the area. All three family members got involved in the hunt, but you will notice the 5-year-old gets in there quite a bit at the end. It's always amazing to see how young these animals in to learn the skills to survive. Please note this video was taken with a 600mm lens while abiding by whale watching regulations that can be found at bewhalewise.org. -Traci Walter, Western Prince WW

After receiving reports of the
T123 family of transient killer whales heading down President's Channel
, we departed Friday Harbor to meet up with them. When we arrived they were milling for a brief moment before changing course directly towards
Green Pt, Spieden Island
, where the steller sea lions hang out. Suddenly exploding through the water was T123 charging after a sea lion. The hunt was on as she and her 2 offspring lunged and leapt after it. We think he was one lucky sea lion who escaped close to shore after a dramatic encounter. -Barbar Bender Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
