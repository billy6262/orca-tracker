Orca Sightings for May 8, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was so happy to see
L87 Onyx off of Lummi Island. He was swimming with Alki J36
at the time. I was on the IE4 from La Conner with Island Adventures. The research boat from the Vancouver Aquarium was also there and flew their drone above the
J16 pod
. I hope they've got good news about the health of J-pod. -Kristina Trowbridge

A predation event with a CA sea lion began just several hundred yards offshore by 15+ orcas

beach. Seeing lots of thrashing. -Ariel Yseth

By

1:00 p.m. -
it was clear they were on to something as several were
porpoising at high speed directly towards Richmond Beach
Saltwater Park. I got down to the Beach and at approximately

1:15pm
, rounded the overpass to see flying bodies and churning water 100 yards or so off shore! The tired and injured Sea lion swam along the shore...At some point the
T101s
joined from the west and at
1:55 the earlier most northern pod joined as well. (see video below) -Alisa Lemire Brooks
Here is a 8.5 minute video starting just after the first contact and ending with them taking the Sea Lion. WARNING: there is no blood or gore but there is closeup footage of the sea lion getting taken under just feet from shore around the 7 minute mark which might be upsetting to some. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network,

Entry 4:
*
At

12:45 p.m
. I moved to Richmond Beach Saltwater park and watched them move south.
Seem to have no interest in the gray whale. T101s are on the west side channel
and trailing a bit north behind the others.
Approx
12:35 p.m. - The
two lead groups joined up are are just resting
, convening? mid channel now east of the yellow mid channel buoy between Richmond Beach and President Point. I am in contact with Puget Sound Express/Chilkat who has come upon a small emaciated gray whale who is just 1/4 mile ahead. They are taking photos and keeping track of the whale so that the stranding networks can be alerted. We all of course are wondering if there will be a predation on this whale. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
The predation event took place in-shore off Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline by several pods. Reports and documentation of the encounter were included in our
May 8th Whale Sighting Report Part Two: Bigg's, including a sequence of Tom's photos of
T68B
who has the sea lion in her mouth. ID notes from these photos and other sent to Dave Ellifrit at Center for Whale Research: "In addition to the
T101s
, the only whale I can confirm (I'm still waiting for my first T68Bs encounter) is that
T124A1
is also in there."

I spotted
three Gray whales 100 yards out from the beach in Birch Bay
which is near the Canadian Border. One of their tails was visible when they dove further off shore heading toward Point Roberts. Other folks have reported seeing them for a few days. Apparently, it's been over ten years since we've had such a treat! -Connie Jones

Around noon today - Gray whale in Birch Bay.
