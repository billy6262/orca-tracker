Entry 2:
(
ID notes by Dave Ellifrit , CWR: "yes, that is T87. The others are too far away and backlit to say anything with any certainty."
)

They are literally circling in the same spot for 30 minutes.

4:35 p.m. - At least 10 orcas off Possession beach
on Whidbey right now. Milling around with lots of spyhops and tail slaps. There are two groups. One right near NOAA and one mid-channel. -Nicole Woltersdorf

More for you - we also saw
Transients hunting a sea lion
(can you view my photos on FB?). There were
a group of 5 - I've ID'ed 2 in this group as T124A1 and T124A4
the others might be too young for the 2012 catalog I have. An hour or so later, 2 others swim past east of the
group of 5.
One of the two, a big male
T087
, swam close enough for a picture, but we never saw the other one he was with. ID photos (below) Location 47'55N, 122'21W. -Amy Willoughby

Lots of breaching and activity just

Southern Gulf Islands -
6:00 p.m. - Humpback whale close to Portland Island, BC:
I saw a humpback whale heading SW, alone, between Portland Island and Salt Spring Island, parrallel with Portland Island. I first saw the whale when he was breathing, directly across from my kayak. It then dove and I saw a little bit of the tail. There was a small BC ferry some way behind it, and it stopped, I assumed to let the whale alone. I saw the whale 4 more times, breathing with the doral fin clearly visible. It was heading towards Cobble Hill, North of Piers Island. Behaviors: He appeared to be traveling. There was no Whale watching boats around until after he was gone. -Nathanael Lisimaque

There's a whale surfacing now in
Commencement Bay
. Been hanging out 30 min or so. Can't tell if it's a grey or humpback. Was heading towards the grain elevator at

Entry 4:
*
Admiralty Inlet -
12:30 p.m. - Lone Grey Whale in Admiralty Inlet near Bush Point
. Nice big fluke out of the water. A sail boat went right in its path and we didn't see it resurface so no direction of travel noted. -Sonja Thompson Sackett
*
Puget Sound - Noon - A lone Gray just off Point Jefferson, Kingston
meandering it's way north, 12 noon, Saturday. I am pretty sure grey, flukes were smaller and shaped a bit different than a humpback there was a definite difference with it's back. -Chris Beamer Otterson
*
North Puget Sound -
5:30 p.m. - There are two whales mid channel between Eglon and Edmonds
. I can't tell what they are. Not seeing a good dorsal view. Saw tall blows and couldn't ever get a good look at their bodies they were barely coming out of the water. My guess would be between a humpback or gray. I'm used to seeing humpbacks but couldn't confirm a dorsal fine or none. There would be two blows right after each other from one whale then the second whale would follow and sometimes both whales would blow at the same time. -Erin Steinman
*
Dalco Pass -
1:48 p.m. - Appears to be orcas foraging in Dalco Passage between Pt. defiance and Gig Harbor
. No photos but a couple groups are out there. I'm not definiite on anything. They didn't breach so couldn't truly tell. Maybe wishful thinking. -Larissa Nipper (
Reported as orcas but RP unsure and we had no other reports, other possibilities are Harbor porpoise or Common dolphins - ALB
)
*
Coastal dolphins - WA -
I went out on a Pelagic birding trip...About 30 miles west and a bit
north of Westport
, we encountered a large group of
Pacific White Sided Dolphins estimated at 350+ individuals, 150+ Risso's Dolphins and 75+ Northern Right Whale Dolphins
. The Northern Right Whale Dolphins decided to bow ride and I got a bit of video. This was the first time the boat operater had ever had this species bow ride. Part one video includes a young one swimming in it's Mom's slipstream. -Connie Bickerton
