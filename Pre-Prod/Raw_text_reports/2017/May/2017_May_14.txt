4:30 p.m. - Humpback whale and calf
- Whilst birding from the beach at
Little Qualicum estuary (in Georgia Strait
about 25 miles NW of Nanaimo BC) I watched
an adult and calf humpback
cruising down the channel across to Lasquiti Island. They were surfacing and diving together then deep dove, to feed?, and came back up in same general area before fluking and diving again. Traveling when first spotted and pausing to feed. Deep dive then back up in same area twice. -Peter Boon

Mothering Sunday with
humpback whale Big Mama
! Not only was Big Mama (
BCY0324) present off East Point, Saturna Island
, B.C., but also one of her calves,
Split Fin (BCZ0298)
born in 2006, together with companion Divot (BCX1057). All three whales were in a steady traveling pattern, undisturbed by the growling and groaning of the many Steller sea-lions swimming or hauled out on the rocks nearby. Calm conditions enabled passengers to view local marine life at its best, and witness first-hand Big Mama's explosive exhalations. As the saying goes, "Thar she blows." -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
