Orca Sightings for May 5, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's/Transients - Orcas were seen coming out of Hammersly inlet and playing out in front of Squaxin Island at around
4:20pm.
Stayed in sight for approximately 1/2 an hour. Appeared to be playing. 2 small Orcas kept flipping out of the water and splashing with their tales. 2 large males, 2-4 females, and 2 small infant whales noted.
Headed up towards Harstine Island
after playing. My husband and I saw them this morning
in front of Steamboat Island and counted 9 in the pod. This was around
10:15 am. They then headed down into Totten Inlet. The pod came back around
11:15 and headed to Arcadia Point and then into Hamersley Inlet.

Beautiful! Large group in the lead with adult male and calves. Smaller group in the middle and another with 2-3 adult males (probably T101s) trailing about a minute from leaders. All Powering northbound in mild chop.

5:00 p.m. -
They went on a long dive just south of the bridge and surfaced well north of it, pods now a bit more spread but in general together. Now a little more east of mid channel, steady northbound in travel mode.

4:50 p.m. - Made it just in time to see them in Pickering Passage
approaching Hartsine Bridge from the south, loosley group in pods, mid channel. steady northbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

The
T86As, T100s, T101s, T124As & T124Ds
have been traveling together in
South Puget Sound
for the past week. I'm not sure who all was in this group as they came north through
Pickering Passage
, went on a long dive just south of the
Harstine Bridge
and surfaced pretty far north of the fridge, by-passing all of us on shore at the boat launch. Still breathtaking. 2nd part is from shore further north in the Passage, even more breathtaking. Little babes in their backdropped by gorgeous Harstine Island. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network,
