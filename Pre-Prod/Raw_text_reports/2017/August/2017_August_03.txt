2:13 p.m.
- My brothers, mom and aunt all saw
3 orca whales. They were in village bay Mayne island,
right beside where the ferry terminal is located. From what I could see there were 2 young ones and an adult. -Madison

They were actually already
past Race Rocks and heading easterly
when we encountered the trailing group at
1222
. This group consisted of
L90, L91 and her son L122, L92, L72 and her son L105, L83 and her son L110, L47 and her son L115
. After a quick inventory of whales, we left the whales and headed toward the leaders that were then off Trial Island. This group was the L4s in a group, but they soon spread apart off Seabird Discovery Island and headed toward False Bay San Juan Island... Full encounter report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 60.

We saw the pod from the
West Beach at Deception Pass State Park
thanks to this post. Thanks! They were headed North towards Allan Island. -Michael L Stolfi

At
1330
they were still headed north. From
NAS to Deception pass
. We stationed on the bridge to see if they would enter but the tide would have been fighting them. We left before we saw we're they ended up.

Entry 7:
8:25 p.m. -
Hung out in front of our house (at the
Dalco
wall), for a while and has since headed
up Colvos
.

7:38 p.m. -
What looks like a small
humpback
in the ferry lanes between pt Defiance and Tallequah. Closer to Vashon. Was on the
7:25 ferry. -Sarah Bradford Honeywell

2:42 p.m. -
Someone brought us in phone pictures of
a humpback whale
about 20 minutes ago and said they saw it at the end of
Redondo Beach
going toward Dash Point. -Highline MAST Aquarium at Redondo staff
*

10:55 a.m. -
I saw it again about 10 minutes ago. It went down for a deep dive. This time I saw it slightly farther north, closer to Salt Water. It appears to be hanging out in this area with no definite direction at this point. The whale's head was facing away from me so I didn't get a good look at the dorsal fin, only the fluke on the deep dive. What I can confidently say is that this was a much bigger whale than the juvenile humpbacks that have been near Tacoma. ...It was amazingly close to Redondo when I saw it this morning. I've never seen a humpback there. It certainly
looked like a humpback
to me.

10:24 a.m. -
I am at
Saltwater state park
right now and I just saw a large whale (humpback?) surface twice farther south towards Poverty Bay. Visibility is poor but there are also numerous porpoises or common dolphins close to the salt water shore. -Heidi Vincent
