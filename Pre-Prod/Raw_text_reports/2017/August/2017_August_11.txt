Dolphins -

Entry 3:
a Pacific white-sided dolphin just north of us on the
2:30 Kingston to Edmonds ferry crossing.
I didn't get pictures, but I've seen common dolphins before. This dolphin jumped up, so I saw it clearly and it wasn't a common dolphin. I looked up pictures when I got home, and the markings and size were consistent with the
Pacific white-sided dolphins
. It was pretty cool to see! -SJ Siff (email)
