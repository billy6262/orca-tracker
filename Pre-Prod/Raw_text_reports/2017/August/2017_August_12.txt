Orca Sightings for August 12, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait -

7:45 p.m. - Killer whales in Haro Strait around Smuggler's Cove:
On Saturday
August 12th we went sunset kayaking out of Snug Harbor with Crystal Seas Kayaking, and paddled south hugging the coast. When we reached the Smugglers Cove we saw a Bold Eagle hunting about 200 yards from the coast, we also saw birds circling the area. A few minutes after few spouts were seen and sure enough a group of about
4-5 Killer Whales
(probably Transients were moving slowly north, probably through Mosquito Bay when we lost sight of them. A few people also saw them from homes around Smugglers Cove. We were the only ones out there. It was so awesome! traveling slowly northbound. -Patricia Villamill
(
T60s were ID'd in our last report dated
August 14th. This group may have included the T10s who have been traveling with them earlier in the day and days prior. - ALB

Orca Network Staff, On
August 12th at about
6 PM, about 4-800 yards into Ludlow Bay, just off Tala Point
, in as little as 12 feet of water (by sonar readout),
we were surprised by some Orcas while pulling our crab pots
. There was
a small group of four Orcas
, including what appeared to be a Mother, an adolescent, a younger adolescent/older calf and a calf. When I was younger, I worked with Dr. John Lilly for 1 week in Palo Alto; a full summer in Florida and a bit of time at UC Santa Cruz with Dr. Randy S. Wells; and 1 month with Dr. Lewis Herman in Hawaii on their projects. My family has had a condo on the water in Port Ludlow for more than 18 years, and we have never once seen Orcas in the bay. I have seen Gray whales once for about 4 days, porpoises fairly frequently, seals fairly frequently, a sea lion once in a while, and sea otters often. I believe I have correctly IDed the Mother, due to her larger size, but small dorsal fin. We were stopped pulling our pots when we heard the blows and saw them coming at us.
They stayed around us anywhere from a couple of hundred yards to as close as 8-10 feet away.
They swam around us, and headed away and then back at us several times. The younger adolescent seemed to enjoy approaching us, and did so several times near the end of their time in the bay. Initially, within about 1 - 2 minutes of first seeing them,
either the mother or the larger adolescent came abruptly out of the water throwing a seal 10-15 feet into the air
, to our great surprise. There was then some roiling of the water in a bit of a frenzy and we never see the seal again.
All three of the younger Orca appeared to be playing and tail slapping the water relatively gently, with one breaching with it's body fully out of the water, but not jumping way up and out, essentially it skimmed across the surface fully out of the water. At one point either the Mother or the adolescent stuck it's head far out of the water, nearly to it's pectoral fins, and seemed to be taking a look at us. The younger adolescent seemed to enjoy swimming near us, and did so, including a small, 1/2 submerged breach behind us. At least three times we thought they were headed back out of the bay, then, we would see them come back our way. We were not sure if they were chasing fish, or just having a good time, or something else entirely. When the Mother, the adolescent and smallest calf finally headed out of the bay permanently the younger adolescent continued to stay and swim around us for several more minutes, and then finally disappeared, and apparently headed out to join the rest on their way out of the bay. When they were a good 1/2 mile away from us and did not seem to be turning around again to come back our way, we finished dealing with our crab pots and headed back to the marina to go home.
This entire event lasted between 35 - 60 minutes, but we were not keeping track of time because we were so amazed they were there at all! I am waiting to receive the videos and photos of them, as sadly, I did not even have my cell phone with me in order to take photos of the mugs, saddle patches nor dorsal fins, which I would have been happy to have done. But, if there are good images when I get them from the others, I will send them along for your database and identification. Of course, I would love to know who we saw if you have them ID, and I suspect you do.
Sincerely, Greg C. Brown, M.S., ISA AM.

Entry 8:
Spieden Channel
- We headed west via the San Juan Islands to escape the fog, and what a treat to find sunshine! Pretty quiet "out there" today but we found
a humpback whale
- zig-zagging his/her way close to Spieden Island. We had some good views of this whale before circumventing Spieden Island, where we found many harbor seals hauled out, several bald eagles, ravens and turkey vultures arguing over a carcass. We returned to port under sunny and clear skies, great to have our good weather back! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
