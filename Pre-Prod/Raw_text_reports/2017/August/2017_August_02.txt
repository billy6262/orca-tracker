Orca Sightings for August 2, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hallo, As a tourist I was traveling the
SE coast of Galiano Island and I encountered orcas
at

7:50PM
. SE coast of Galiano slowly traveling towards SE. They were calm, maybe playing and slowly moving towards SE. -Marco Venturi
*
San Juans - Small group of
orcas passing eastern shore of Waldron Island 8 pm
. Larger matriarch leading but not captured in video. Northern shore of Orcas Island in background...at dusk headed east around SE corner of island turning north around the bend. -David Rhine
*
Puget Sound - Son T46E and mom T46 -
4:45 pm
Chilkat Express left them on a kill at Double Bluff trending north while feeding. We left to view a bald eagle and have been unable to resight them in the haze. -Photo by Justine Buckmaster,

Entry 2:
(
T46, now a great-grandmother, was among the last orcas captured during the 10-year capture era, in Budd Inlet in 1976. She was released after a few days of headlines about the captures and a lot of legal wrangling that resulted in freeing all the captives and ending all orca captures in Washington. - HG
)
*

12:35 p.m. - passing Glendale
. When we left at

12:45 pm
they were still mid-channel heading
towards Possession
at a steady pace. Then, who knows?
12.10 p.m. - whales close to ferry lanes (Clinton/Muliteo)
southbound mid channel. -Sandy Pollard

Same orcas,
T46s
, that were in Saratoga Passage yesterday 8/1/2017 heading south today out of the passage and into
Possession Sound
this morning. Watched with a new orca friend Phee, it was great! A few of us so excited and screaming LOL. loved it...orca's can sure bring people together. Watched, first from the bluff at Sandy Point looking east towards northern tip of
Hat Island
and Everett in the background behind the smoky haze, very washed out, so washed out and hazy, when I had first seen the orcas this morning (thanks Alisa and Orca Network) high above Sandy Point looking westerly, cannot see Everett at all. When Phee and I first saw them from the Brighton Beach area, they were west of Hat Island and east of Whidbey Island. Orcas continued traveling south towards Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes..orcas were more near us or no further mid channel vs closer to Hat Island. Then watched from Glendale across towards Mukilteo, as orcas continued mid channel southbound. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

11:05 a.m. - from Cascade Ave on the bluff above Langley Marina
, I first saw one male surfacing mid channel steady southbound between the marina and Camano Head. I then spotted at least one female and younger one up ahead to the south a short distance. The pod was loosely spread as they all continued heading towards Sandy Point, Whidbey at steady pace southbound. Blues skies enveloped by smokey haze from Canada's wildfires. Seas flat calm. Nice to catch a glimpse before our staff meeting at Langely Whale Center. What timing! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

10:50 a.m. -
We're straight out from
Langley
right now! We're coming up on Langley now with the
T46s
! I'm on the Chilkat. -Justine Buckmaster

10:12 a.m. -
Stephanie Raymond aboard the Victoria Clipper just saw the
T46 matriline in Saratoga Passage
, just south of Holmes Harbor, heading south and highly active, with tail slaps and breaches.

Yes! I am guessing these are the guys [
dolphins
] we saw in the same area around 7/2. So fun, they were very playful and curious around our boat as well. -Brenna Sowder

1:00 p.m. -
More
gray whale activity here around the corner from Neah Bay
- I live on Bullman Beach. After a relatively slow three weeks or so, they seem to be back more consistently in the past two weeks or so. A number of them, as the attached photo attests to, coming in really close. Where this whale was photographed, I was walking earlier in the morning at low tide. It stayed in front of Room #5 at our Inn for over two hours. -Scott Hartman
