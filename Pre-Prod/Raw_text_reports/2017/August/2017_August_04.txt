WOW...What a GREAT DAY! We had a feeling we would sea the Southern Resident Killer Whales around

today after hearing some of our local fisherman catching many 30-40+ pound Chinook Salmon yesterday...Sure enough
L Pod - L72 Racer and others
spent most of the day in Sooke waters on a feeding frenzy! -Paul Pudwell

We listened to blows of
L pod moving north and then south on the westside of San Juan Island

Currently watching a
humpback in Port Madison
about 1/2 mile off shore from the NE corner of Bainbridge Island. They were doing a lot of out of water lunges and fin slapping! They are trending northwards toward Kingston. This is a pic taken of the
humpback whale
that cruised north just off shore of
Bainbridge Island
at midday. Taken just north of Fay Bainbridge Island looking toward the ferry lane between Kingston and Edmonds in Port Madison bay. We saw lots of lunges, fin/tail slapping and tail bobbing. What a whale show off! -Tim Cuddy

Secondhand report from neighbor that
Humpback again heading north at northwest end of Colvos at 830
