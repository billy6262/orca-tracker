A beautiful morning on the water headed towards a report of whales, when we find another group, the
T65As
! These guys grabbed a seal at
Smith Island
and then rocketed to go hang out with another group of
Bigg's Killer whales, the T137s
. Then yet another group in the distance joined up! Socializing and playing ensued! Breaching, tail lobs. What an awesome time on the water! -Western Prince WW (Video below by Traci Walter)
*
What an amazing day we had with Transient/Bigg's orcas,
T137s and T65As
!! We caught up with them on the
west side of Whidbey Island
, after stopping at
Smith and Minor Islands
to see wonderful tufted puffins, which is always a treat. The whales were in full active mode, leaping out of the water, sideways breaching, massive tail slaps and cartwheels, and alternating between fast porpoising and slow resting mode. They were obviously on the hunt, though we didn't actually see the prey. One Steller Sea Lion on a buoy was probably relieved that they passed him by! We followed them south almost to Ft. Casey, and then turned north to see harbor seals on the spit between Smith and Minor Islands, and then headed home. A truly fantastic day with these beautiful whales! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.
