Orca Sightings for August 26, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
South side of Blakely Island. 5 orcas
. Looked like 3-4 females and one male. Traveling east.

8:10pm
8/26/2017. They were
Orcas
. And 100% sure of what we saw. It was from the Washington state Ferry from Victoria to Anacortes, the Ferry crew even announced it on the intercom. Location of south Blakely Island verified on the GPS. -Jeffery Johansen

A picture perfect windless day, we headed to Canada to see Transient/Biggs killer whales,
the T34s, some T36s and T37s
. A long trip but so worth it, we found the whales
west of Tumbo Island
, and were fortunate to watch them slowly
trending NE towards Point Roberts
. So many beautiful islands including Patos with the lighthouse, and we stopped to watch harbor seals by Sucia Island. Harbor porpoise were easy to spot in such calm conditions. A magnificent day, thank you Mystic Sea for going those extra miles. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

California transients male CA20, and females CA54 and CA177, found off Jordan River around noon
on Aug 26 by Sooke Whale Watching and identified by Eagle Wing Tours (also on scene) via Jared Towers (DFO) and Alisa Schulman-Janiger (California Killer Whale project.
The CA Ts were with the T60s before the two groups abruptly parted company
, with the CAs heading west toward Cape Flattery and the T60s heading east toward Victoria. The three CA transients are usually seen travelling together. -Photo by Val Shore,

Entry 2:
(
California killer whales visit BC Saturday! Eagle Wing Whale Watching Tours encountered a trio of "exotic" outer coastal Bigg's transient killer whales on 26 August - including three of our California killer whales: male CA20 and females CA54 and CA177, with inner coastal Bigg's transients T60s. They were in the Juan de Fuca Strait, several miles off Jordan River, Vancouver Island. Sooke Coastal Explorations first encountered them, and then Eagle Wing came on scene - including Captain Chris Bane and Naturalist Val Shore. They were likely feeding when Eagle Wing arrived, but the trio soon split off and quickly headed west toward Cape Flattery. Eagle Wing followed them for about 20 minutes before turning back to the T60s, who had headed east. This trio has been seen previously off BC. What an exciting update for our California Killer Whale Project: we have studied these whales for 30 years! -- Alisa Schulman- Janiger
