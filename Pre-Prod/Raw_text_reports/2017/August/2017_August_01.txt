Orca Sightings for August 1, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
An orca came and swam with me on the first day of my 86km history making
swim around Saltspring Island
. The encounter happened around
3:ooPM
on
August 1st. There were
4 or 5 orcas, and one came and swam with me for a while
, while I sang it a First Nations Whale Song. It came within a mere inches and approached from different directions hanging out with me for a couple of minutes. Never touched me but came so close as if inviting my touch. The song was as much connection as I could muster. But it was a very beautiful experience. Here is a LINK to a video of what we caught of the encounter. -Rama DelaRosa

Around

8:50 p.m.
- Look how close they were from shore. really not that far out. they were under for at least a mile when we last saw they out from
Bells Beach from Fox Spit
. Very long down times! First seeing them around

5:30 pm across from Hidden Beach towards Onimac Pt (Camano Island)
followed them as they came south mid channel
Fox Spit
and watched them from Langley where they milled for about an hr
2 miles north of Langley
on the Whidbey side (guessing near Saratoga Woods area) and this is where they decided to turn back north again and watched them from Fox Spit around 9 pm until it became too dark. Last we saw them they were over near Camano State Park and heading north westerly towards Hidden Beach, Greenbank. -Marilyn Armbruster

Bells Beach
but out 1/4 channel or so and heading northerly.

they have been milling in one area south of
Bells Beach
now for quite awhile. Still 2 miles or so from Langley. Must have found good food!

(Whidbey Island) and Elger Bay (Camano Island) heading south towards Langley, mid channel

August is here and our trip today took us on a totally different route - via Deception Pass to Saratoga Passage and south to
Crescent Harbor
- by the Navy's old Seaplane base in Oak Harbor. We found a family of
transient/Biggs killer whales, 5 of them - Matriarch T46 (est. born 1964), T46D (born 2000), T46E (born 2003)...
, checking out the harbor. We had great views of this family (T46s) before turning for home, via another fun route, the Swinomish Channel through LaConner! Great sightseeing, with an osprey, bald eagles, herons, seals, and much more before reaching home port. You never quite know which direction the Mystic Sea will take - but it's always a fun day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

16:20 - Polnell Heights
- Three
possibly four orca between Whidbey and Camano
