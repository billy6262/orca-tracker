Orca Sightings for August 10, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
After hearing reports of the
T10s and T60s near the Chain Islets
, Dave and Michael headed down to the boat and left Snug Harbor around 1020. We finally arrived on scene about
four miles south of Discovery Island at about 1100
. The whales were in a fairly tight group pointed east at first but soon turned south. The whales zig-zagged quite a bit but generally headed south or southeast.
T10C and T60C
often dropped behind the others to socialize with one another...
T10B was not present during this encounter
. We only know of a few T10 encounters in 2017 but T10B has not been seen since 2016...Also, T60C appears to have had someone or something bite him near the top of his dorsal fin... -Full encounter report & photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 61.

Another lovely day with
Transients! Caught up with the T10 and T60 group south of Hein Bank
.
T10
matriarch (center w/notch, 1963 est. birth year) travels with her family & the T60s. The two big males, T60, who apparently has a new scar and back slanted tip of his dorsal fin, and I believe T10C were mostly staying close together.
The matriarch, T60
was there as well as a fairly young calf. -Bonnie Gretz

I was fortunate to spend time with a beautiful group of
transient/Biggs killer whales, the T10s and T60s, T60C sporting a fairly fresh injury on the back top edge of his dorsal fin. Sea lion bite maybe?
, they look so plump and healthy! T10C and T60C spent a lot of time together, with T60C sporting a fairly fresh injury on the back top edge of his dorsal fin. Sea lion bite maybe? -Jill Hein

Entry 2:
Salmon Bank, HB south of Beaumont Shoal
, and caught up with the
T10's and T60's at Smith Island
- and saw 4 tufted puffins (the seas were very big, rolley and difficult to take photos). Never seen Smith Island up close and it was as cool as I thought it would be.
T60D with T60F doing a spy hop at Smith Island.
Lots of seals on a long sandy spit with crashing waves and Ts beside them. Some dilapidated light house on top. Lots of birds nestled in this huge Kelp forest along the island. Puffins flying here or there. Dreamland! -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

We went the extra mile today catching up with
Transient / Biggs Killer Whales T10's and (T60s) South East of Victoria
...Fog and some Nautical Seas didn't stop us... it was a real adventure and smiles all around! What will tomorrow bring? - Paul Pudwell

Entry 5:
a whale passing by Lincoln Park northbound
. Another commenter on WSB had the whale
passing Alki at
5:00pm
, thought to look like a gray whale and by the photo that looks possible.
