Orca Sightings for August 17, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sighting on
West side of Cypress Island
(8/17 at

3:00pm
). I was on a boat cruise and we sighted these
3-4 Orcas
(Transients, I presume) on the West side of Cypress Island, close to shore. Looked like they were hunting. -Photo by Joe Little,

Entry 2:
(
ID notes by Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research based on this and other photos: " I see T36B in there"
)
*
Great to SEA the
Transient Killer Whales (T11 & T11a) "Rainy" and "Wakana"
east of Sooke hunting close to shore at Williams Head, Pedder Bay & Albert Head on our nautical afternoon tour...Mother and son team. T11 is a 54 year old female and her son, T11A is 39 years old. Although this pair looks almost identical to a Southern Resident Killer Whale, there are many differences. Residents are fish eaters (feeding mainly on Salmon in our waters), Transients are mammal eaters feeding on seals, porpoise, birds, sea lions and young baleen whales. -Paul Pudwell

5:30 PM -
WS Ferries reports the ferry Yakima delayed leaving
the Orcas Island ferry terminal due to a pod of orcas surrounding the ferry landing
. No numbers or direction of travel given. (That was the T36Bs! - Traci Walter)
*
While there continue to be lots of transient orcas around the Salish Sea, it has been pretty slim pickings for those of us trying to watch whales from the shores of San Juan Island over the last couple weeks. Today I did manage to catch the
T30s as they headed south through Cattle Pass
. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Entry 3:

Yes this was the
T30's
- we were on scene and stayed with them
as they explored Griffin Bay and exited Cattle Pass approx 6pm. 6 animals.
-Barbara Howitt

Saw pod of
5-6 go by Spencer Spit about
3:30 pm
. Came in through Thatcher Pass and were headed toward north end of Upright Channel. -Sheila Guard
*
Another lovely day with Ts/Biggs orcas...this time the
T30 group
, who I hadn't seen before. Caught up with them at
MacArthur Bank a little before noon
, and they slowly
moved east into Rosario Strait
, then turned
north up Thatcher Pass
where we left them at around

2:30
. (stopped for a sightseeing tour in-between watching this group)Lots of close swimming, surfacing together, and the new baby (7-8 months old or so) is adorable, little T30B2, hanging out with her/his uncles and sibling. -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 4:
west of Sooke
always hoping to find our SRKW returning to the Salish Sea...Not yet...But as always were excited to encounter
over 20 Humpback whales feeding
in some nice calm water with a smooth swell. -Photo by Paul Pudwell,

Unidentified whales

Entry 6:
11:13 a.m.
- surfaced again. (in Cattle Pass, between Cattle Point and Goose Island last surface directionally NNE bound San Juan Channel)

10:38 a.m. -
About three spaced out breaths of a single moving blow hole, with a peak of (smelly!) baleen cetacean (tail fin) and then nothing. From Cattle Point Beach shore! If anyone in the area sees anything let us know. Minke? Humpback? -Mana Rahl
