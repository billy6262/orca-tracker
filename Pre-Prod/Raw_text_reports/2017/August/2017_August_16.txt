Orca Sightings for August 16, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
3-4 orcas (transients) in Buck Bay near Olga on Orcas Island about 6 pm
on Wednesday 8/16/17, traveling south toward Obstruction Pass. I have never seen them here before! -Photo by Jackie Derksen Chester,

Entry 3:
(
reported as T11&11a w/tT36b's, but T11s were wi/T46Bs earlier. We are working on confirming who was w/T11s in afternoon - ALB
)
*
Spent the morning with
T11A and T46Bs 2 miles east of race rocks
. They were heading west. Here are some photos of the encounter. More photos in the comments. There were more orcas in the distance so I can only assume one was her (T11). It looked like T11A was trying to mate. -Danielle Pennington

The
T137's
are back in town! We just love this incredible
family group of 4 orcas
. We haven't seen them for quite a while, so who knows where they have been! They ventured all the way into Eastsound on Orcas island too! These images were taken on the Western Explorer PM trip on
August 16th. We got to see so much wonderful behavior in a short time. We caught up with them as they were traveling, then they took a turn and a stop at Olga for a family seal snack and some socializing! A beautiful evening on the water here for sure! -Western Prince WW

August 16th reports from
Liberty Bay and Suquamish MAY include 2 different whales of which one is a probable gray
. The only documentation received is video from later in the afternoon that we shared with staff at Cascadia Research, John Calambokids replied: "I think gray whale from lack of dorsal fin but hard to confirm without seeing coloration."

- Central Puget Sound - I just spotted in Miller Bay - quick up for air and down! Its staying down for long. long stretches. I only saw a brief blow between

7:45-

- Whale at Suquamish dock
6:30
. -Jen Matchem
Friends JUST got here about

4:30pm
They thought I was just joking when I pointed and screamed "whale". I ran and grabbed the kayaks and we jumped in the water.. Paddled out
Manzanita Bay
and this is who we found (see video) In all of the excitement, I
thought it was a humpback
as I paddled with one there last year. But this whale took quick short breaths and 2-3 minute dives. NEVER saw a fluke. Sorry the video isn't better but we were respectfully a good distance away and this is from my cell phone all zoomed in to the max. We paddled with it from along shore as it traveled north to the
Agate Pass Bridge (
6:00pm)
What an amazing experience. Hearing it was a Minke? Feel free to share this video with those who can help us id this guy. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

(John Nesby was the first to report this whale, here are his comments after viewing Kim's video: "The motion of this breach looks exactly like what we saw. I'm pretty convinced now that I did not see a dorsal fin, but rather just a raised back followed by the tail (I think in the excitement I assumed all whales have dorsal fins). This sighting was a first for me, in front of my house. But this video very much looks like what we saw. It's hard to compare size from the video but it is certainly similar. I feel like this animal in the video "could" be larger than what I saw. Lastly the one thing we are both certain of are the white spots. We saw them clearly on the second sighting that was so close to shore. I can't tell from the video if there are spots. That rolling motion from the video is definitely what we saw yesterday though")

1:24 p.m. -
I'm watching it. It pops just its back up for a moment then takes long dive times. Can't confirm species. No direction of travel. It's been in the same place roughly for the last 20 mins. He/she was too quick. So far no surface behaviors. -Melinda Barajas

12:31 p.m. -
they were heading into the bay and I haven't seen them leave yet. A research boat just came in a few minutes ago

11:48 a.m. - Heads up! Whales swimming into Liberty Bay (Poulsbo)
right now! Not Orcas, more of a grey looking whale. I'm not an expert at all on whales. I was fishing on Lemolo Point and my son saw them. I thought he was mistaken and saw a seal. Then BOOM! Big show about 75 yards off shore across from Keyport. It was really special to see. We saw an exhale but it wasn't big like I see on TV, it was subtle. They were close enough to the shore (Poulsbo side across from keyport) that we could hear it. They sort of rolled like a wave and yes I think they had a dorsal fin. We saw the backs of them not really the head. My super untrained eye would guess an animal of around 20 feet or so. Also it appeared to have a few white spots on the otherwise grey skin. Almost like big barnacles. We think we saw 2 animals. They went from Lemolo then went out into the wide part of the channel at the mouth of Liberty Bay under the Big Power Lines that cross the bay. (see John's comments above under Kim Malzhan's video). -John Nesby
