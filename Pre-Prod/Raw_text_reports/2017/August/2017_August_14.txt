============================================================

Entry 1:
many Grays, morning, noon and night off Kalaloch Aug 14, 15, & 16
(Heaven!). Rolling very close to shore, etc. We didn't see many Weds afternoon after the youngster stranded. I saw no Orcas. -Susan Oseth

Juan de Fuca - T55 and her son T55A -
Another amazing day with the Transient / Biggs Killer Whales
T055's & T37's around Sooke
today. In the morning we encountered them from Race Rocks Lighthouse to Sooke than in the afternoon we visited them from Sooke Harbour to Otter Point...Always Great to sea! -Photo by Paul Pudwell,

Entry 3:
6:07 p.m. - they've split. Some are heading north along whidbey shore while the others continue to mill in the same spot.

5:43 p.m. - The encounter at Ebeys Landing
even more amazing. They made a kill close to shore. Some breaches and cartwheels and tail lobs. Still milling just off Ebeys Landing.

5:15 p.m. - viewing from Ebeys Landing northbound
, further offshore than ft Casey but still easy to see without binos.

4:40 p.m. - Omg they just passed ft Casey insanely close to shore
. You could see them under the water swimming. I was shrieking so loud, wow.
4:50 they are pushing NW offshore.
Members of the T65As and T99s spend time close to shore off Fort Casey as they were exiting Admiralty Inlet.
With the report of whales headed past Lagoon Pt, I rushed over to Ft Casey and made my way to the bluff. You could see the whales headed straight our way. But when
they surfaced RIGHT there just offshore
, I was freaking out! They were so close to shore, you could see them swimming underwater, their breaths shockingly loud. Then, I headed to Ebey's Landing. The whales weren't far off shore, but not as close as they had been. They went down, when suddenly some went porpoising back south, a few more porpoising from another direction, and yet more from another - the hunt was on! Whatever they went after appeared to dash for shore, as the whales started rapidly heading in towards shore. The water appeared to turn red and the gulls gathered above - the hunt over as quickly as it began. -Rachel Haight

On our last day in Vancouver we took a Sunset BC Whale Tour out of Victoria, and encountered the
T65As around

7:30-
7:45p.m. off of Whidbey Island
on the Strait of Juan de Fuca close to the Naval Station. It appeared they were eating, their behavior was active. -Patricia Villamill
*

6:17 p.m. - Orcas of off Ebey. 3~5 of them
. Most likely transients. It looks like the are just milling or some possible feeding. -Mac Kelly
*
We saw
2 pods near fort Casey around 5pm
. It was a dream come true to spend time with these clans! -Photo by Amanda Hughes,

south of Ebeys Landing
. -Renee Beitzel

4:25 p.m. -
James Davis called from Seacrest Lane, which is way inside the bay east of the Keystone ferry landing.
About 4-5 orcas were about 1/2 mile from the beach for about an hour
. Then they went west and have probably rounded Ft. Casey by now heading north.
*
At about

2:50, 3 Orcas passed Lagoon Point very close to Whidbey Island
. Appeared to be two adults and one juvenile. Heading quickly north. -Margaret Marshall
*
T65As and T99s passed Point No Point headed North around
12:45pm
. They were moving fairly quickly, but when they got due north of the north side of the point they appeared to stop and hunt. There were a series of breaches, followed by several whales heading back south briefly. I couldn't determine if the hunt was successful or not. I never saw any gulls gathering, and there were many in the area. After this brief break, the matrilines continued their northward travel. -Connie Bickerton

After making their way up Puget Sound (and killing a couple of smaller cetaceans) they spent time hunting again about
1/2 mile off Point No Point
, Hansville, Kitsap. Some breaching, tail lobbing, headstand, and directional changes. When we left about

northbound travels up Admiralty Inlet
, loosely grouped just north of Hanseville still very much on Kitsap side of channel.

we just go back to
just south if Point No Point
cut engines and they hauled really fast right past us northbound towards Point No Point about 1/2-1 mile offshore. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

spread drifting while prey sharing. They are still
south of the boat launch at Eglon

Entry 9:

7:30 a.m. -
watching them in
Rolling Bay from Skiff Point
. They were in some pretty shallow water there for awhile--right where stuff gets exposed at low tide. Saw a few good breaches and tail slaps. They moved into deeper water now but are still milling about. Slowing trending northwards. -Lynn Batson

7:15 a.m. -
They are currently milling just
South of Fay State Park

WA State Ferries called to relay a report from the ferry Wenatchee, of
five orcas northbound near their WSF maintenance facility at Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island at
5:50 am
.
*

Entry 10:
5:54 p.m. - sailing off Shilshole
. Just saw
a whale
(not orca) crossing the shipping lanes headed from
West Point to Port Madison
in direction. We definitely saw
a small dorsal
. It was swimming at a good pace but surfaced and spouted multiple times as it crossed our bow path. We got a great view of its tail also as it dove. We all thought it
looked like a humpback
tail (and dorsal), but I wasn't certain as I hadn't heard any recent reports of humpbacks in Puget Sound. -Jan Lewis-Newby

Entry 11:
4:35 p.m. -
We just saw a whale about 5 minutes ago-we both saw blows and Harley saw its back-he thinks it was a gray but we aren't sure. It was pretty close to shore just
north of Mukilteo ferry dock
and right after ferry left. Wow-totally unexpected-it has been a most interesting day on the water, for sure! -Harley Clark
