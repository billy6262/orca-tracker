Orca Sightings for February 2, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Judy Dicksion called in another report that the
Transients
in Hood Canal had gone south past Hoodsport at

4:45 pm
, & were continuing south toward Potlatch.
*
Followed the
transient
pod of 6 (2 large, 3 medium and one baby) orcas that has been frequenting Hood Canal lately, from

3:30 pm
, when I located them north of Lilliwaup (thanks to the very visible orange-vested NOAA/NWFSC folks who were accompanying them down the Canal on their southward journey today), until about
6pm
, when I watched them (from my vantage point at Potlatch State Park) vanish into the very calm waters on their way toward Union. The sun was setting behind me, the pale purple and pink so typical of Canal evenings was reflected on the still waters, and Mt. Rainier loomed snowy white in front of the black fins of the whales as they sliced gracefully through the water. Incredibly beautiful. As I walked my dog in the dark, at about
7:15 pm tonight, 200' above the Canal just north of Potlatch, I heard their blows in the water below me, very close to shore. They must have circled round and were on their way north again. I won't forget this day for a long time.

1:10 pm
. Researchers were able to photo ID all the orcas today, & confirmed they are SE Alaska Transients, & confirmed the tentative ID's made by Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research of T124A and T71 (& offspring?).
