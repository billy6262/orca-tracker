Orca Sightings for February 19, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received another report of orcas off Fort Bragg, CA. The reporter saw 10 - 12
orcas
heading north, just north of the Noyio (sp?) River off Ft. Bragg, in ~250-300' of water while he was trolling for salmon.
*
5-7
whales
hunting and killing a Harbor Seal just prior to sunset. They then formed a organized group and proceeded north again in the direction of Twanoh State Park.

2-3 whales (
transients
)? going east, seen from the Coho enroute to Victoria at about
0940
today, that would be a few miles south.

Kurt on the Rumblefish reported a pod of 25 - 30
orcas
off
Fort Bragg, CA
at
11 am
. The pod included several large males.
*
Larry Morgan reported orcas (
Transients
) offshore of Sister's Pt, 8 - 10 miles from the lower end of Hood Canal. He heard the whales at
7 pm
.
*
Finally at
2.05pm
eagle eye Don spotted them (Hood Canal
Transients
), with the boat in tow, just north of Holly in mid-channel. They were moving fairly fast. The Six seemed to be on a very important and focused mission and "flew" by Jorsted Creek. As usual, they hugged the east shoreline pretty well.... even passed Hoodsport at
3.30 pm
. But eagle eye came through again and saw a couple of blows near the Union Boat Ramp at 3.40pm.

Elaine Wiley of Hood Canal saw the
orcas
going south off Ayok Pt., mid-canal, at

2:10 pm
.
*
I saw the
Orcas
pass by Hood Canal Marina in Union. The time was

4:05
. I only saw two for sure. They were headed towards Alderbrook. They didn't surface as much as they did when they were here Feb. 5th. They were moving at a constant pace.
