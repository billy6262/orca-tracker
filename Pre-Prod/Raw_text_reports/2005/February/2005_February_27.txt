John Herman called at

11:15 am
with a report of the
Transients
in Hood Canal - they were at Great Bend/Musqeti Pt. heading south - actively breaching as he was calling in the report, & they had made a kill. By noon they were heading south to Anna's Bay.

Carol from Glen Ayr called to say the
transients
were in calm water near the Kitsap Peninsula opposite them (north of Hoodsport) at

12:24 pm
. Did not state any particular direction they were moving but at 12.41 pm they were doing some breaching! Cindy from 1 mile north of Hoodsport called to say at 1.00 pm she was watching the six transients about 2 miles north along the east shoreline. They appeared to be "milling about" (probably foraging), with some "acrobatics" ....yet generally heading in a northerly direction.

Watching Humpback whales In Bandaras Bay, Puerto Vallarta. Watch a goup of three for about an hour. One of them breached 8 or 9 times. Before that they were rolling and showing pectoral fins. Also dives with tails showing several times. Spectacular!!! Next trip out just followed two for a half hour. Just swimming. Saw dolphins and turtles also.
