Orca Sightings for February 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Judy Dicksion called with her daily Hood Canal
Transient
reports - she found the orcas in 2 groups, just south of the Hamma Hamma River, heading south closer to the Kitsap Peninsula side of the canal at approx.

1:30 pm
. At

3:10 pm
she had all 6 orcas going along the east side of Hood Canal, passing Lilliwaup going south toward Hoodsport.

My husband saw the
whales
below our house, in Hood Canal today (1 mile south of Hoodsport. It was around

2:20pm
. The whales swam mostly underwater. He ran an errand and came back later, when everyone else had gone, and saw them in the same area, leaping out of the water.

I just got back from Union where we, (Judy and a couple from Bremerton), watched the 6
Orcas
feeding. (

3:30ish
),I drove down to Hoodsport just as the Orcas were just passing the Pier. The 6 were in the center of the Canal swimming South. Too far out to see any identifiable markings. When I finally sighted the Orcas, they were doing a lot of splashing, short dives, slapping their tails on the water and breaching. All in one general area. I assumed feeding activity. Judy confirmed it when she showed up. They were off the tip of the Kitsap Peninsula near Tahuya. The feeding activity went on for awhile. Then it ended and they disappeared. Judy informed us that they probably had made a kill and now were submerged eating it. Apparently they go under water to feed.
