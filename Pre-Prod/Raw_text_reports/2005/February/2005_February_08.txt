Orca Sightings for February 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
From the North Shore of Hood Canal near Tahuya, WA, we were lucky enough to see 5 female
Orcas
. It was about
2 in the afternoon
. The whales were heading north, and surfaced probably a dozen times, but never breached and didn't seem to be playing necessarily. They did surface quite close to a fishing boat, but we saw them from the shore and were close enough to hear their spouting. We were at the Great Bend of Hood Canal, near Bald Point.

Today my granddaughter and I traveled to Hoods Port. (Hood Canal) There were two pods. At

12:00
this afternoon they were by Lilliwaup, hugging the shore opposite of 101. At

12:30
we drove South on 101 and took some photos of them just about 2 miles north of Hoodsport. It looked as if they were just out for a leisurely stroll. Nice blow and face photos. Still on opposite side of 101 across the bay.

transients

10.00am
. heard that the whales had gone north from Hoodsport at approx 2.30pm.

Today at approx

4:45pm
I saw a pod of
killer whales
traveling towards Trial Island, approx 2 miles off shore of Dallas Road in Victoria. (I was sitting at Ross Bay). I counted two large dorsals and a bunch of smaller fins. I would say I thought I counted approx 7 - 8 animals. I watched them until

5:30
when i lost them around Trial Island due to low light. I would say they were getting a bit closer by that time. They seemed to be travelling at a good speed, and were sometimes spread out a bit.

We are at Cougar Spit. West side of Hood Canal across from Hoodsport. We spotted 4
Orca
whales off of our beach at

2:15pm
today. There were two orcas out in the middle of the canal and two others about 40 feet offshore. The two orcas that were close to the beach appeared to be a large orca and a small orca (mom and baby?). They were traveling South.
