Orca Sightings for February 10, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Had a terrific day out with the
transients
until leaving them at Hoodsport at
5.30pm
. When I returned to Pt. Whitney in the a.m. the whales were doing some breaching and tail slaps, particularly the youngest. After about 10-15 mins they moved south after appearing to make a kill, lots of birds getting apparent left-overs! They traveled slow past Zelatched Pt. with some tail slaps and low breaches as if chasing something but kept moving. Just north of the Dosewallips Delta they all became very active... huge breaches, appeared to be some rolling over with pec slaps and a spy hop. One of the large females seemed to roll over on her back and slap her pec fins together... that was really unique for me! Their travel was mixed with the "milling around" and various slapping activities until they reached the Duckabush. When passing the delta there at 12.45pm they were in a transit mode with beautiful backlit blows. Missed them at Triton Cove but picked them up again at the bluffs south of the Hamma Hamma River about 2.45pm. They skirted the shallow water at the west side, then some "milling" and hit mid-channel traveling again. Passed Jorsted Creek at 2.55pm and around Ayock Pt at 3.00pm with sunlight showing the blows well. Wandered across the channel when arrived at Eagle Creek about 3.15pm and stayed till 3.55pm with a terrific two kills, lots of seabirds, even a mature Bald Eagle, plenty of splashing and couple of breaches and/or half-breaches. One small seal was by the road trying to get up the shallow creek... but was safe! I went to the Lilliwaup bluffs where they were traveling south fairly fast. Connie and Nick, Jefferson Road Dept, were rounding a small cove and crossing one of the smaller creeks earlier they said, when all six animals got in a line and swam straight towards the bridge, managing to presumably get the seal they were chasing. Lots of splashing and underwater activity but neither got to actually see the animal "caught". The transients then seemed to slow down as they headed past Lilliwaup to Hoodsport where they were closer to the Kitsap Peninsula side. Those of us on the Marina pier got to see some great activity as they passed. Two spyhops, one really looked like a huge animal and one smaller, also lots of tail slapping. Then they reached the center channel off Musqueti Pt, when they definitely made another kill with sea gulls, probably imm. bald eagles and an adult one getting in on the scraps. We even saw a couple of "head stands" (one by the youngest) where about a third of the body with the tail was perpendicular to the water. I did not count the seconds but they stayed that way long enough most people saw them... I have never seen that I don't believe. Left them at 5.30pm with the water and sky both delicate shades of pink.

Then with full bellies came all the playfulness/spyhops breaches etc.seemed to wait for tide change then caught the ebb tide up Discovery Passage for Seymour Narrows

Dave Satterly called to report the 5 - 7

9 and
9:30 am
.

The
Transients
were out in front of Hoodsport from around

4:30 to
5:15
feeding. There was a lot of activity - breaching, tails raised out of the water for more than just a dive, tail slaps and raising the upper body out of the water looking. They appeared to have made two kills by the way the birds were acting. One out in front of the pier and one a little further South. An adult Bald Eagle and two immature joined the sea gulls looking for scrapes. Now the Orcas are traveling South and should be off Potlatch State Park. Still enough light at

5:30
to see them. There seems to be a pattern to their movement. Usually from
2:00 to
5:00 p.m. they pass through Hoodsport. If they come in early you can find them over by Alderbrook or off Tahuya. They come in with the raising tide and start working their way out after the tide changes.

We live above Sandy Beach in Potlatch, on a tree farm that fronts the Canal along Hwy.101 between Potlatch and the old ITT Rayonier Lab just south of Hoodsport. The whales have been along that stretch of the Canal for the last 20-30 minutes (
6 -
6:25 pm
), heading very slowly north towards Hoodsport. Their blows were clearly audible, as well as one loud, plaintive wail that I've never heard before except when they passed below us in the dark over a week ago. Could it be from them, or an unhappy seal? Did not sound bird-like. Heard a bit of splashing and whacking of the water below me, so they might have made a kill. It's high tide,and they must've been very close to the shoreline, along Hwy. 101.
