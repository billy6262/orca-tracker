10 am

We had whales this afternoon. After a very promising start of me spotting them at
10.10 am
from the boat launch in Quilcene Bay within the time it takes to raise your binocs and start scanning....there they were... probably less than a 100 yds away, right in the little cove on the west side south of the pilings...After my call to you they meandered down the west side very leisurely until almost the lagoon of the Shellfish Lab. Then they decided to all get into "traveling formation" and blowing together for a couple of surface porpoising moves then dove down when next to the old pier and came out beyond Point Whitney. They were closer to Pt. Whitney than the Bolton Penin. so I had to assume they went south at about 10.40 am. By
4.30pm
Don had the Slippery Six in sight. About 1/2 mile offshore from Seal Rock as Don said, just milling around. By 4.45pm we started the show! Several kills... Don believed he witnessed two because of the milling, then underwater, then sea gulls, then some play time... couple of breaches.... before he left. We saw a double breach, tail slaps galore.... one of the larger females did about 6 in a row, then some reverse tail slaps, the "headstand" tail straight up out of the water several times and some magnificent leaps clean out of the water with three doing it at the same time. One time it looked like four did a sort of "star burst" all jumping out of the water and falling backwards. Almost everyone stayed till 6.00pm with the transients heading slowly towards the shore at Seal Rock.
