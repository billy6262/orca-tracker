Orca Sightings for February 5, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called at

1:48 pm
to report he'd sighted the Hood Canal
transients
at the Sund Marine Reserve, just north of Hoodsport, on the west side of the canal. They were circling & feeding, then dove out of sight.

Judy Dicksion called with several reports of the Hood Canal
Transients
today:

3:45 pm
. they came around the corner of S. Hood Canal opposite the Union Boat Ramp, coming south from Hoodsport. A possible kill.

4:45 pm
they had gone past Musqueti Pt going east past Union & Alderbrook, then all 6 of them into a small cove (Calm Cove) where there was lots of breaching activity, tail slaps & lots of gulls & evidence of a kill (& someone observed a seal being tossed through the air!). Another kill was made at Union. They then went on to Tahuya, closer to the Kitsap side to the south end of the Canal & were rounding the point as she left them just before 5 pm.

Just got back from watching the whales (Hood Canal
transients
). First found them at Octopus Hole heading South at

12:50
. Went ahead to Rest-A-While where I and about 20 other cars watched them make two kills in about 25 minutes. They didn't do the tail smacking, but were doing a lot of circling and dive all in one area. Seagulls came in and started feeding. A Bald Eagle joined them. It looked like it was looking for seal scraps rather than seagulls. About ten minutes after the first kill they started doing the same thing - circling and diving. Two seals were observed right next to the bulkhead looking very nervous. The pod then went back into it's traveling mode, (surface dives for about three minutes then under for about 5 minutes), heading South.
