Orca Sightings for February 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out yesterday with Steve Jeffries from WA Fish and Wildlife, and Josh London from UW. We were with the whales (Hood Canal
Transients
) from
1130 to 1715
. They made two kills (probably harbor seals). They look fat and healthy!

Observed several
Orcas
make a kill off Pleasant Harbor on Hood canal at around

4:10pm
. The usual circular technique of the hunt. At the time of the kill the seagulls all decended and shared in the feast. The orcas fed then made a leisurely push toward the southern end of the canal, I lost sight of them at about Hood Point. Total time spent in the area to my observation was almost 6 hours.
