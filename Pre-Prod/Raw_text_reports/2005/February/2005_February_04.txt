Judy Dicksion called at

1:30 pm
- she was out with Fish & Wildlife Researchers Steve Jeffries & Josh London & they had received Harry's report that the Hood Canal Transients were at Hoodsport. She called later to say they were with them for several hours, from the SW corner of the Kitsap Peninsula at

2:30 pm
, between Potlatch & Union & observed them feeding. They continued to head east toward Alderbrook, & made a run toward the shore. They left them at

4:25 pm
, as the transients continued NE rounding the SW corner of the Peninsula. At one point they observed a whale grab one of four Mergansers that had landed to feed on the scraps from a kill - the whale let the bird go, but it had one foot over its back & wasn't in too good of shape.....but was healthy enough to dive whenever the researchers attempted to retrieve it!
