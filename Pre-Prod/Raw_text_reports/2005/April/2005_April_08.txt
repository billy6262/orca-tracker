Orca Sightings for April 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received a call from Claude Corbeille, who reports seeing 5
orcas
off Pacific Beach, WA about 3/4 mile offshore from the Navy Recreational facility there at

12:55 pm
. He said he watched them for 15 minutes as they headed north - no large, male fins were observed.

Two
Grays
feeding. Location, three miles north of Langley on Saratoga Passage.

Update on
J pod
. We found J pod at about
1000
this morning heading north in Swanson Channel and followed them through Active Pass. We left them at about
1230
as they fanned out into the Strait of Georgia. Everybody was present and documented.

We saw 2 or 3
gray
whales at about

6:30-
7:00 pm
. They were surfacing and spouting, and rolling about. They were in front of the Inn at Langley then moving slowing while feeding until they were below the Dog House Restaurant where we and other excited patrons watched.

The
gray
whales did return about

6:30 pm
in the shallow waters below upper First St in Langley. Two large adults fed for a good 20 minutes. Both Veronica and my husband Simon took pics.

It is about

7:40 pm
and we are watching the blows from what looks like 2
grays
just a little east of double bluff. Looks like they are moving back and forth, maybe feeding.

We just saw at least two (
gray
) whales spouting just southwest of the Scatchet Head buoy,

7:15 pm
. Looked like they were just milling around, but could now be headed north. Could not see fins or backs, but the spray is shining in the sun.

This evening around

6:00pm
, two (maybe three)
grays
happily fed first 50 feet, then 100 feet from our deck. The closest we've ever seen them here. The other amazing thing was that there were about 20 seagulls fluttering wildly above and around them taking advantage of the ghost shrimp frenzy. The whales moved on leisurely to Langley.

3:45 to
4:30PM:
Two
Grays
off Whidbey Island north of Langley. They were traveling south going out to deep water and then back near shore. They were rolling and feeding. Watched them for 45 minutes as they slowly passed by Saratoga Woods Parking Lot.
*
think we saw the
greys
that Marie saw as they headed south. I'm working high up on Possesion Ridge. We actually saw what I took to be two different pairs. One was about a third of the way out in the channel, and one closer. Later in the day we saw greys(2) headed north. That was closer to
2 PM.
*
I saw the HCT
Orcas
heading North in front of Hoodsport at

12:30
today. They were in their normal swimming mode - no interruptions.

I was at the beach today
1230
and heard what sounded like a whale exhale. Sure enough feeding along the shoreline of Discovery Bay was one lone small
Gray
. From the top of the sand bluff it was clearly visible thru the clear water. Location: 48 03' x 122 50' the East side of the bay where it turns about half way up the shoreline. At
1530
I checked again and it was still there cruising slowly up and down the shore about 200' out.

Judy Dicksion relayed a report from Harry Louch of the Hood Canal
Transients
at Hoodsport at

12:12 pm
. Judy was doing a Duckabush seal count - no seals around, then she saw splashing & fins down by Canal Tracts, they were making a kill, then moved south around

5:30 pm
.
*

11:30 AM:
Two
grays
, about one mile off shore--due south of the Scatchet Head Community Center--very active, surfacing often--too far out to get much detail.

Clinton

Debbie called to report 2
gray
whales feeding near Langley, mid-Saratoga Passage at

10:30 am
, heading slowly NW.
*
My neighbor, Harry Louch, called me with a heads-up about the slippery six
orcas
being north of Hoodsport, heading south,at about

1:30
.

I finally caught up with the
transients
at the south end of the Duckabush Delta mid-channel about
4.45pm
. They were doing lots of various in/out of water activity which appeared to be serious foraging! They went under at one point for about 10 mins and a few birds gathered. The gulls kept diving down so I think a possible kill occurred. They either were playing with another seal or purposely chasing it with another flurry of activity and gradually moved south out of my view at Canal Tracts. I returned to Canal Tracts about
6.30pm
. Though getting darker we all could see plenty of breaches, tail slaps, lunging etc. and sea birds around so possibly another kill around
7.10pm
very close to the Kitsap Penin opposite the South end of the Duckabush Delta. It was about 8.00 pm when I finally left.

1100
Jpod
in Swanson Channel going north towards Active Pass. First reported off Turn Pt. just after
0800
.

Two
grays
off Gedney Island's (also known as Hat Isl.) west side at

9:45am
today. They milled across to Whidbey heading south. Left them just north of Clinton ferry dock at
10:30am.
Marie Piper
Whidbey Island

At

11:00 AM
they appeared, a dozen or so black and white behemoths (
J pod
), spread out broadly at the southwest entrance to Active Pass. Soon they coalesced at Helen Point, and began their journey through Georgeson Bay, hugging the Maine Island shoreline. As they entered Active Pass proper, the Queen of Nanaimo came through (politely moving to the center of the channel to give the Orcas a wide berth), and it seemed that everyone on board moved to the port side to catch a glimpse of the whales as they breached, rolled, and, well, just behaved like whales.

Galiano Island

We met up with
J pod
1 mile east of Active Pass and east bound at

12:15pm
.
Cedric
Vancouver Whale Watch
Dodie Markey of Camano Island called around

11:30 am
to report a
gray
whale close in to Mabana on S. Camano, during low tide.
*
One
gray
whale was seen around

7:45 am
about 200 yards off the Langley waterfront park moving slowly to the south while feeding. Two or more were seen later further north of Langley probably moving south.
