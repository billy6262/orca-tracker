============================================================

Entry 1:
Judy Dicksion called in to relay several reports of the Hood Canal
Transients
- they were reported by Hannah near Union at
4 pm
, going north around Bald Pt. At
4:30 pm they were off the Holiday Beach area still going north.
*
Gail Fleming of Langley called to report 2
grays
off Langley between
7 &
7:30 am
, and a 3rd further south by Sandy Pt. They were traveling slowly south, first feeding, then traveling mid-channel. The white fin waver was one of them.
*
It was an early morning wake-up call from a pair of large
gray
whales.

7:00-
7:25am
we were visited by two of them feeding in the shallow waters below the west end of First Street in Langley. They seemed to be drifting toward the west in no particular hurry.

There were at least two
gray
whales feeding on the beach at

2:30 AM and
4:30 AM
both times for over 30 minutes. At

6:10 AM
two whales (maybe the same two whales?) fed on the beach for over an hour.... one is definately "Patch".

I met a couple that were on the
1100
ferry from Tswassen on Wednesday morning and saw a pod of
orca
north bound 10 minutes from departing (south of the coal docks). They showed me some pictures they took from the side of the ferry and I can confirm that it was Jpod.
