Orca Sightings for April 25, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Was sitting in my living room (above HWY 101, south of the old Rayonier Lab, on the west side of Hood Canal across from Mesquiti Point), when I heard VERY distinct blows, large and small, from right below us. The popping noise turned out to be tail slapping. The Slippery Six (Hood Canal
Transients
) were back! Grabbed my husband and dog and we went out on the lawn, where we heard a great amount of activity between

10:10 and 1020 pm
- INCLUDING DISTINCT ORCA CALLS (no mistaking gulls for them this time -- no gulls at all anywhere near). We listened till about
10:35 pm, when we had to get back, regretfully leaving them within earshot, but traveling north toward Lilliwaup.

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters reported
J pod
spread out 1/2 - 3 miles offshore the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, west San Juan Island, heading south toward False Bay at
6 pm
.

Gail Fleming reported 1
gray
whale (the white finned-waver) just north of Sandy Pt, south Saratoga Passage, feeding close to shore at
5 pm.
*
We were on Maple Beach (south of Scenic Beach State Park) and saw the
Transients
, just North of Pleasant Harbor, about mid channel at about

4:30 P.M
. They were heading north. We saw 3 come up and then two. They headed toward Toandos peninsula and then turned East and appeared to continue north towards Bangor.

We had a good day with the Hood Canal
transients
. Found them before
9 AM
mid-channel north of Dewatto Bay, heading south. They proceeded south along the east shoreline and around the great bend. One probable kill (presumably a harbor seal) just at the bend, then a chase of a harbor seal that got away by moving quickly into shallow water just to the east. At that point the whales turned and re-traced their path northbound. Just north of Lilliwaup Bay they encountered a male California sea lion, and began an extended period trying to kill it. While being battered, the sea lion slowly made its way towards the western shoreline, and made it to a shallow water refuge right offshore. At that stage the whales turned south and we left them southbound around
3 PM
about half a mile north of Musqueti Point.

Finally got a chance to see the
J pod
this year. They were moving slowly, spread out, and offshore between Pile Point and Lime Kiln around
1400
today. Had a nice spyhop from J34!
