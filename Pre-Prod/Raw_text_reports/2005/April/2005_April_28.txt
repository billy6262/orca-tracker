Orca Sightings for April 28, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod
was cruising leisurely westbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca at about
1500
hrs. J2 & J1 were in the lead, then the rest of the pod paraded by singly or in mother/calf pairs. J14 (Samish) came right over to our parked boat with J40 right beside her. The calf rolled on its back and gave several of our passengers an excellent view of "her" belly. From photos of male/female belly patches, they picked the female form. We'll see if the Centre for Marine Mammal Research can confirm this in the future. In any case, it appears to be a spunky, healthy little calf.

About

7:20 pm
, 1.5 miles South of Hoodsport, about 100' above the Milepost 333 on Hwy. 101, west side of the Canal, when I caught the gilmmer of the fading sun bouncing off the fins of our 6 Hood Canal
Transients
slippery gals as they transited in tight formation along the east side of the Canal, heading south. They disappeared, then reappeared, still in formation, just off Bald Point. Looked like they were making a beeline for the Skok River flats where all the seals hang out.

At

8:30 AM
I was treated to another sighting of the
grey
that has been hanging around South Sound. This morning he seems to be staying between Stretch and Reach Islands (47. 20. 072 N 122.49.385 W) which is fairly shallow, running at about 8 - 9 fathoms. He blows every few minutes and seems to be circling within the area. He has also (I have been told) passed behind Reach Island, through the shallows of Fair Harbor. When the grays do visit here, they seem to always spend time in Fair Harbor during the upper end of the incoming tide.
