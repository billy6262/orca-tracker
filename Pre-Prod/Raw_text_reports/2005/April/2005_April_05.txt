We live on Lower Hood Canal WA at Sisters Point. Althought we have had several sightings of
Orcas
in the past few weeks & haven't reported them, we did see six at approximately
two PM
heading North toward Belfair, approximately 150 yards offshore. There were none with large dorsal fins and it appeared that three of the six we spotted were smaller.

I happened to look out our window & catch a bit of
gray
whale fluke over near Camano Island at

4:10 this afternoon
. We watched for 20 minutes at least one, possibly two grays feeding & traveling in Elger Bay. I first saw one traveling south, then it disappeared behind trees, but soon either the same whale or another appeared traveling north. It fed & dove in Elger bay, then seemed to be traveling north toward the State Park. At 5 pm we saw another in the same area, heading north.
