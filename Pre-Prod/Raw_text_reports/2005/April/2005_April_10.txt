Orca Sightings for April 10, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:15p
. Just came back from watching large
gray
feeding from just north of Inn at Langley to the Langley Boat Harbor. Probably the same one Susan saw at
6:30p at Camano Island State Park. Very close to shore -- no more than 100 meters, with two harbor seals and lots of birds following to clean up.

The
orca
pod in Hood Canal was off of Sister's Point headed toward Union, WA at
1740
hrs. They were about 1 1/4 miles away so I didn't get a good look at what they were doing.

The
Grays
are regular visitors of late. This evening @

5:00
, one Gray gracing our shoreline. At about the same time my neighbors reported whales (don't know the count).
