While enjoying a perfectly still evening (

10:55 PM
) and enjoying the twinkling lights across the water, we were treated to the sound of a lone
whale
surfacing every 4-6 minutes, slowly heading North past Low Island (west side San Juan Island). My first whale report of the year! Yippee!!!

Today we encountered two
gray
whales in Haro Strait west of Battleship Island traveling north towards Turn Point. Both whales were traveling closely together making about 5 knots.

Two
gray
whales very close to shore off Seawall park in Langley, 5
:00 p.m
. Heading east.
Brian Lowey
Langley
*
I heard a couple of
grays
at
7a.m
. this morning down at the bottom of Park Ave in Langley (see report below). Just now, 10 hours later at

5:00
, I saw the pair (perhaps a return visit?) feeding near the shoreline at the bottom of my property on upper First St, Langley. One large, one smaller. The large one is the critter with the white-speckled fluke fin that is blunted at the end. We've seen a lot of it this year.

Mary Jo Oxrider called to report 4
gray
whales going south just off Fox Spit, so. Saratoga Passage at
3 pm.
*
Capt. Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called to report 2
grays
between Stuart Island & Gooch Island (San juans) heading north from

2:30 - 3 pm
.
*
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at
1 pm
to report 2
grays
off Possession Pt, 1/4 mile offshore at the Possession buoy, going south. One of the whales was "Patch".
*
7a.m.
and a coupla
grays
at the bottom of Park Avenue, close to shore in Langley. I can hear them, but can't see them yet. This seems to be a favorite feeding spot, as they have returned repeatedly.

With Judy's help we found the
transients
in Hood Canal today, just after
1 PM
north of Whitney Point headed south along the west side of the channel, leaving them about
4:30 PM southbound off Duckabush. One positive and two probable kills, presumably all harbor seals.

With some obviously well honed motoring skills (like doing a 360 deg turn on a dime!) Robin was able to pretty well stick with the
Six
from about
1.00 pm to 6.00 pm
. They found the
transients
on their "last chance" search... almost up to Pt. Whitney towards Quilcene Bay. Their milling around; going off in all directions and then turning to pile on with some "head stands", a few leaps and tail slaps would indicate several possible kills.
