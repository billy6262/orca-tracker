Harry got the word out early on the
Slippery Six
trying to sneak by his place almost at
dawn
traveling slowly north. At Dabob Bay there they were! Sort of nosing about Tskutsko Pt. the SW corner of the Toanados Penin at approx
1.40pm
. The Six moved slowly in all directions with occasional tail slaps from the younger ones along with two huge spy-hops from one or one from each of the adult females! When the whales were under for some time the birds started diving down... presumably a kill had been made and there was free food! They were heading up towards Pt. Whitney.

Transients

At
8am
two
grays
were feeding at the bottom of our yard on the West end of First St, Langley. They traveled east toward Langley at a leisurely pace, circling and feeding as they went along. Very still waters today. When the tide's out, the mudflats are pocked with dozens of divit holes left by this season's gray whale visits. And more than a few folks have seen a seal following along... perhaps oportunistically munching loose ghost shrimp stirred up by the whales!

Looked out my window at

6:00 a.m.
to see the HCT
Orcas
on the West side (Hwy. 101 side), of the canal just below my house (Hoodsport). They were spread out moving fairly slow. At
7:00 a.m. found them again on the East side of the canal across from the Octopus Hole moving North. They are moving North at about 3.5 road mile per hour. Up on surface breathing for about 2 mins. Then under for at least 10 minutes. The canal surface is like a mirror.
