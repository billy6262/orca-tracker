I followed 2
gray
whales along the beach south of Mabana, heading NW. The 2 grays fed on the flats about 100 ft off shore on an incoming tide. A third
Gray
could be seen further out in the Passage.

At

8:20 pm
I was on my deck on Cougar Spit (East side of Hood Canal, across from Hoodsport). I could hear the
Orcas
breathing. I spotted one big black fin. I can't say what direction they were headed as our visuals were brief.

Just saw what we believe to be a
grey
whale traveling past our home on Zangle cove,
~
5:30 pm
. It continued North on Dana passage (heading toward) Tacoma. We heard it before we saw it. Loud sound of blow hole then watched it surface and go back under. Surfaced four times over a period of about 15-20 minutes. We could still hear it long after we could see it. It was too far away to catch any marked characteristics.

The Hood Canal
transients
were across Dabob Bay from the Point Whitney Shellfish Lab today @
1210
. There was lots of breaching, spy hopping, and tail slapping. Many gulls were present. They were over there for about 45 minutes. Then they moved to the center of the bay where I saw them toss a harbor seal into the air twice. Then they continued south and out of sight around the point.

Two
grays
at

6:30 am until
7:45
feeding at Mabana on Camano (W. side) They remained close together the entire time. One slightly larger than the other. One heavily barnacled. They do find these tide flats a great place for food.
