Orca Sightings for April 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod
today! We caught them southeast of Discovery island where they hung out for a little bit and and then moved southwest with them a little ways. They played around a little for us. There was quite a bit of tail lobbing and spyhopping and the babies even did a little breaching!

The
gray
whales were out there again... and again! At about

8:00pm
, two, including "Patch," fed close to shore along the west end of First Street. Now it's
9:20pm and we can hear, but cannot see, another one, perhaps two, feeding off the end of nearby Park Avenue.

At about

2:30
my wife and I saw a
minke or gray
whale southbound at Lagoon Point canal outlet. We first observed bubble pools at 2 locations in the current off the point. A moment later the whale blew. We saw the whale 2 more times as it headed south. A couple of days ago we saw 5 or 6 orcas go by southbound during midday. The bull was close to shore and others scattered out as far as mid channel.

Carol Fassett reported the Hood Canal
Transients
in Dewatto Bay, Milepost 323, at

2:30 pm
for 45 minutes. She observed swirling water & sea gulls, a likely kill.
*
Union Marina @

10:00 AM
and she said we had missed them (HC
transients
) by about 10-20 minutes and that they appeared to be heading north up the west side of the Kitsap peninsula towards Dewatto. We had our first sighting of probably 3 of them, 1 large female and 2 younger ones heading north up the Kitsap shore of the canal. We continued following them as they worked their way north up the shore until they were just about opposite the Cushman Generators. We lost them just north of Dose mouth. They had turned back south and we spotted them across from Hoodsport Marina. Continued south with them until they stopped traveling and spent about a half hour just off Dewatto. At that point we are fairly sure we counted 6 of them together, 2 large females with young. They then started traveling south again (about

2:00 PM
) and appeared to be heading toward Bald Point when they went under and we did not see them again.
