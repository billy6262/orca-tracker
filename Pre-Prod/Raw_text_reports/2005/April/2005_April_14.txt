It's

8:45 pm
, dark, and there's heavy breathing on the water. We know the
Grays
are out there -- such a sound. 3 miles north of Langley on Saratoga Passage.

Windwalker Taibi called in a wonderful report of 3
gray
whales right off East Pt, very close in, feeding actively from around

7:30 - 8 pm.
One of the whales was Patch.

Phil Litrenta called in a report of a
gray
whale 100 yards off Blowers Bluff, near the entrance to Oak Harbor, N. Whidbey Island at

6:40 pm
.
*
Reporting three
Greys
moving south down Saratoga Passage off East Point at

4:30pm
. This huge grey back surfaced out of the water not 20ft off shore, next to the seal! YIKES!! Whale backs and the seal head. Double yikes!! Just as I began to wonder if I'd imagined the whole thing, the whales popped up, mid-channel, heading South down Saratoga Passage.

2
grays
in
morning
traveling near shore on west side of Camano. They fed near and in Elger Bay. Then we observed grays in the middle of the passage, and again at evening. All these sightings may be the same whales.

A single
