Langley
*
We saw our first
gray
whale feeding this evening about

8:00 pm
off Langley under The Dog House. Several people were watching and enjoying the whale and the sunset, two kayakers and a sailboat....all kept a respectful distance. It was feeding and stayed around for a long time showing a side flipper (?) and perhaps the smaller dorsal fin.

for a long and liesurely feeding. The whale was still out there as night fell. There will be lots of feeding pits at low tide!!

7:40 PM -
8:30 PM
there was a single
gray
whale feeding off of Langley. This one has the real noticeable "notch" off the left tip of it's fluke. It was heading southeast. It's now
9:40 and we can hear a whale feeding close to shore- not sure if it's the same one or not.

We left
J-Pod
at around
7.30pm
, they were all spread out along Eagle Point of San Juan Island heading east. J1 was way ahead of the group. Saw active feeding behaviour, one individual flung a fish backwards in the air! We had a female swim directly under the zodiac flashing her white flanks, very cool.

Watched
Jpod
pass Victoria's waterfront - Watched them from King George Terrace. Saw multiple breaches. Watched them for approximately 45 mins as they passed Trial Island and then on to Oak Bay. I am assuming it was Jpod, as there were quite a few of them and saw a large male (possibly ruffles).
