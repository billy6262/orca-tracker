or so, & again at

gray
whales in Saratoga Passage between East Pt. & Camano Island State Park, closer to the Camano side.

We saw two

whales traveling together just North of Holmes Harbor again. One of them gave us an exciting show by breaching. There was much fluking going on also. We also saw two other grays just off Strawberry point. Then a lone Stellar sealion fishing around Lawson Reef.
