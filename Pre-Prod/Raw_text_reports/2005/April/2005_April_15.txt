Orca Sightings for April 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had an early morning call from my friend Trixanne Greenlow about the
transients
probably being in the Upper Dabob Bay last night. Trixie lives on the east side of Upper Dabob Bay and had been awakened in the night by a lot of noise. Apparently there were quite a number of seals making a big racket..... growling and trying to get close in shore or on boat docks etc.
