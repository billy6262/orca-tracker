The
gray
whale, that I had just emailed, was headed north mid channel between Langley and Camano, changed direction and headed for Langley. It's now very close to shore NW Langley starting to feed and still moving northward.

Just spent an hour with our slippery friends (Hood Canal
Transients
). My husband called me from Potlatch State Park at about

1:15pm
- they were in very close to shore (lots of yummy seals in the Great Bend and at Enetai). By the time I got there at
1:30, they had moved towards the middle of the Canal opposite Bald Point, but still very visible -- lots of gulls to pin them down. Lots of tail slaps(especially the young one(s); headstands,and, is there such a thing as a tailstand (or maybe it was a half-completed backflip)? After eating, they came together and moved toward the Tahuya side, where they milled around as if trying to decide where to go next -- then another kill, I believe, because the gulls went nuts and there was lots of diving and surfacing in circles. Play time ensued -- one happy camper did FOUR backflips in a row.

On Friday about

10:30
we observed a lone
gray
whale around Camano head. We first encountered it one mile north of Camano Head in Port Susan close to shore. The whale traveled south to the Camano Head bouy then milled about south of the bouy. Lots of tail fluke - almost every dive.

Shane, Island Adventures called with a report of the same four
gray
whales north of Greenbank quite a ways and rapidly moving south. We got with two of them just north of Langley and they were still rapidly moving south at
3pm
Friday. The other two were north of us by Baby Island and appeared to be going to stay up that way. The Gray Whales are very interesting to watch and they seem to be hanging out together rather than solitary this year. I hope this means there is plenty of food and they are able to stay together more and forage.
