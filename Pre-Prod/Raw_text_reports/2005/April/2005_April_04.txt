Orca Sightings for April 4, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
The first sighting report I got was that The Six (Hood Canal
Transients
) were traveling west from Alderbrook Resort to Union at about

11:00 a.m
. The transients had been in the Skoke delta area then moved nearer to Potlatch State Park, eventually starting traveling towards Hoodsport at around 1.09 a.m I understand. Nancy, of Beacon Point Oyster Farm had received a call from her friend that the whales had just passed Jorsted Creek going north at
4.45pm
. I settled in at Triton Tides, scope, binocs and even camcorder! Everything all set ready for their Grand Entrance!....as soon as they appeared..... which they DID almost 30 minutes later at 6.00 p.m. just southeast of the rock formation on the south side of Triton Cove...but fortunately stayed in the same area but very close to the Kitsap shoreline.

Found the Hood Canal
Transients
Orcas today at Potlatch State Park thanks to a tip from Judy. She had called to let me know that they were seen between Alderbrook and the Blue Heron Golf Course this morning between

10:30 -
11:00
. I was heading to Seattle on business so stopped at the park around
12:30. The ranger was out watching them. He pointed out where to look. I was surprised to see them in front of the Skokomish River delta. This is pretty shallow water. They seemed to be hunting. The river water entering the canal made it pretty murky. The ranger said that he thought that they had made a kill prior to my arrival. They didn't come in near the park as they had in at least two previous tours. Instead they headed out into the center of the canal in their slow travel mode heading North. At

7:00 p.m
. found Judy just South of the Duckabush River delta. Although her complexion was blue she was in good spirits. When the HCTs came around the point, Judy came back to her normal animation.

Susie Williams called at

6:55 pm
to report watching
gray
whales going south, approx. 1 mile north of Langley. She reported two pleasure boats circling the whales, 1 boat left after awhile, the other stayed close to the whales.

Capt. Hollywood reported 2
gray
whales off Langley heading north at

6:40 pm.

About
6 PM
, at least 5
gray
whales in Saratoga Passage on a beautiful glassy calm evening: at least 2 north of Langley, at least 1 by Bell's Beach, and at least 2 in the middle of Saratoga Passage closer to Camano. And we finally have whale "divits" all along the beach south of Mabana(Camano); we didn't get to see them, but they must have come through in the dark or during a stormy period.

3
gray
whales at Mabana on S. Camano at

5:30 pm
, feeding moved off as the tide was going out. There are now (finally) whale feeding pits to observe. One long string has 2l pits, from one whale.

2:15 pm
- a
gray
whale at Oak Harbor Marina.... A gray whale came into Oak Harbor Marina Monday afternoon. When we saw the whale, it was between marina proper and Maylor Point on the east end. Saw spout three times. We watched it from D slip. Then saw spout closer out toward E. Watched there and whale was headed out of Oak Harbor. People at Marina said whale had come in actually in Marina between slips and near boats. One man estimated it at 30 feet. We only saw its back briefly and from distance. Couldn't spot any marks. Was in close for about an hour but looked as if it would be rounding Maylor Point soon.

At
1230 pm
a large
Gray
was INSIDE the Oak Harbor marina. Tide was high and about 20' deep where it was feeding between F dock and E dock. Surfaced several times in the fairway between the docks. Often was within 8' of the docks and moored boats.

At

today an adult
gray

At about
noon
today I was on the beach in front of the Point Whitney Shellfish Lab (Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife), near the mouth of Quilcene Bay (a part of Dabob Bay). I heard a distinctive whale-blow sound and looked up to see an adult gray beginning a terminal dive, not more than 70-100 feet off shore. The tide was high and the whale was just beyond the limits of the public shellfish beds in maybe 30 or 40 feet of water. It surfaced shortly and lolled at the surface, breathing. It appeared to be an adult animal, head well-covered with barnacles and lots of white scarring on the part of the back that was exposed. I could clearly differentiate the head from the rest of the body as it sort of rose and sank while lolling at the surface. It dove shallowly two more times and then disappeared for about 20 minutes. It then re-appeared quite a ways off shore, heading toward the top of Quilcene Bay. I got a good peek at the underside of the fluke during the first terminal dive and it was very light colored and outlined with black. The fluke edge was also quite frilled.
