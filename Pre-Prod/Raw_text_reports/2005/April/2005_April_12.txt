Gray
Whales off of Whidbey shores about half way between baby island and east point. They were feeding within 20ft of the shoreline as they traveled toward east point in a easterly direction. Once they got to near eastpoint they headed across the channel towards Camano Island.

Gray
feeding right below, very close to the beach! I could hear the blows, then someone on the beach had a spotlight on the whale and I could see the blows, the bubbles! He/she was feeding in one area for a good 15 min.

Saw 1
Grey
Whale just off the south end of the lower parking area at Camano Island State Park at

2:45
this afternoon. The whale moved west and out toward the center of the strait. Shortly after I lost sight of this one I spotted 2 spouts a little farther north of the boat ramp at the park. Don't know if this was the first one that I saw with a companion or two completely different whales. Lost sight of their spouts in the wind and rain about
3:10 still headed north about 100 yards off the west side of Camano.
