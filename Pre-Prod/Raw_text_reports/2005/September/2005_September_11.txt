Orca Sightings for September 11, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
whales
were in the Strait of Georgia today. We encountered them just across from Ladner - heading towards the Roberts Bank Coal Terminal. The whales were really spread out and were foraging lots, so it was at first hard to get a handle on who we had out there. Decided they were
Ks and Js
- cause positively id'd K21 Cappucino, K40 Raggedy and of course J1 Ruffles himself. We left the whales as they were heading towards Point Roberts, us just being south of the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal.
