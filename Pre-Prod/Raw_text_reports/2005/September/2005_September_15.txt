Orca Sightings for September 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had the whales up North today.
J & K pods, and L57
(possibly more L whales, but he is the only one we saw cose enough to ID) were spread out over several miles between Canoe Pass and the Coal Docks,and offshore. They were heading mostly south and southwest. There was lots of foraging going on, so also alot of changes in direction and pathway. The echolocations were coming in strong and steady, and it appeared that the whales were fishing the salmon that were being pushed towards shore by the incoming tides.

Our son-in-law called last night from a Salt Lake Bay, AK. and said there were quite a few
killer whales
swimming all around them, jumping out of the water. He was on the bow of the barge they were towing and almost got sprayed.
