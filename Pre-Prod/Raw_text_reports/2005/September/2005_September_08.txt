Orca Sightings for September 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We recorded 40 - 45 minutes approx. of
orcas
callings, echocolocation and clicks during the evening. Their sounds started at

8:45 pm
and their location was somewhere between Sunset Bay (west San juan Island). We tried to find them using binoculars but was imposible.

At around

5:15 p.m
the
whales
exploded up the west side of San Juan Island. They looked like at least eight walls of moving water as they porpoised, breached and tail-lobbed their way north. They began foraging off Pile Point as they moved more slowly north. There were several groups of juveniles practicing their tail-lobbing and breaching, as well as one of the new calves repeatedly breaching on top of its mother as she attempted to feed. Many of the big boys passed both Hannah Heights and Land Bank together. L57, J1, J26, and J27, as well as the matriarchs J8 and J2 foraged together off Hannah Heights. As they passed Land Bank, L41 and two sprouters joined the group. At one point they all plunged seemingly into the same spot, apparently after fish. Then J2 did an amazing dive into the same spot immediately after. They all came up about 200 yards away, with L57 tail-lobbing and breaching. Further off Land Bank, two of the new calves were breaching and tail-lobbing. There are rumors that L54 has a new calf. One of them may have been the new calf, since it was orange and could barely breach or tail-lob, although it kept trying. It looked more like a salmon jumping--but was definitely a calf. The only whale in its group that I could tentatively identify was L78.

As we headed out to Hein Bank to see J's & K's, we heard a report of L's also in the area, and a sighting of not one, but two humpbacks. But everyone had lost sight of the humpbacks, so we focused on the orcas. As we approached Hein Bank, we noticed two blows way to the south of the orcas---turns out it was the humpbacks. Figuring we'd see them on the trip home, we continued on. But serendipity happens when you least expect it as J-Pod popped up about 500 yards in front of us. So we diverted to avoid being in their path, only to have them make a circle right towards the humpbacks. And wouldn't you know it, all these whales seemed to congregate in the same area! Depending on where you looked, you saw Orcas in one direction, or Humpbacks in the other! At one point, we had both humpbacks right off our bow and L-Pod whales less than 150 yards away! The orcas then veered off and began to actively feed on salmon while the humpbacks continued on in their Easterly path (maybe headed towards you guys Susan?)
