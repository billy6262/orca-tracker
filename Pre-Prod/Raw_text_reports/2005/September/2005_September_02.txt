Orca Sightings for September 2, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
All three
pods early this morning
near False Bay. By the time we got out on the water, J's & K's had headed North in several boisterous mobs into Canadian waters, and had taken part of L's with them. So we headed out towards Middle Bank to see the remainder of L's.

We received a call reporting a
gray
whale circling in the kelp off Slip Pt, Clallam Bay, Strait of Juan de Fuca at approximately

10:30 am
. The whale was about 20' offshore, near the lighthouse, then turned out toward the ocean.

We live about one and a half miles south of the Hood Canal bridge, on the west side. For the last 15 minutes, starting at about

9:45AM
, we've seen something we haven't seen here before, don't really know what they are. They move like orcas, breaching in just the same way, and there are 8 to 10 of them. However, they're noticeably smaller, especially the fins. I've seen pictures of Dall's porpoises, and these seem about the right size, and right fin shape, but I don't see any white on the flanks.....I went and looked some pictures and stats about the harbor porpoise and that may be what they were.
