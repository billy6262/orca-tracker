Clinton, Whidbey IslandWe had a long trip to the Hein Bank area, but calm water and September sunshine helped us out. A visit with a small group of playful Dall's Porpoise at Turn Point provided a bonus along the way. We arrived to find
J & K pods
spread out over some distance, milling in small groups, or singly. The water was so calm we could see them for a mile or more. As were watching a small group approaching, we became quite concerned about one of the calves as it appeared to be limp and unreponsive while being pushed/carried at the surface for a minute or so. Then the calf swam away on its own, showing no signs of distress. A little later, we encountered this same group, and once again the calf appeared limp. It was first pushed along, then lifted onto the backs of the whales, and slowly rolled over to its back, then its side. By this time, both Captain John and I were sufficiently concerned to call the research boat over, just in case they could provide any assistance. No sooner had we called than the calf once again swam off strongly on its own. Looking back, it feels like we witnessed a very intimate event with this little family group. During the entire time we were with the whales, the vocals were amazing and sometimes so loud that we had to turn down the volume!! One of the other boats also spotted a small
minke
whale on their return trip, while travelling Eastbound in Presidents Channel. The minke was travelling in the same direction, so they saw it several times.

J & K's
were at Hein Bank. The whales were spread out over a few miles, but here and there small groups were in a slow relaxed mood. There were a few breaches in the distance, which is what we first saw when we approached. We then just sat there with the hydrophone, picking up some neat calls. A group that had been way off in the distance was slowly moving toward us - and it was just amazing, what we were witnessing. Judging by my photos (wrong side for id's and I am still learning) it was Ruffles with J22 Oreo & J38 Cookie as well as J11 Blossom and J39 Mako. They passed us very closely, with the babies playing, sliding over mum's and Ruffles backs, slapping their small pectoral flippers and tailflukes, it was the most beautiful scene I have ever seen. It seemed to be happening in slow motion, that is how slow the whales moved along.
