============================================================

Entry 1:
Suzanne of Langley called in a report at

8:25 pm
of a couple of
gray
whales off Edgecliff, just SE of Langley, spouting a lot close to the shore they traveled to the Sandy Pt. pier, & met up with 2 or 3 other gray whales.
*
We left
J Pod
17 miles south of Mitchell Pt., west side, San Juan Island, headed south toward Pt. Angles, at
1900
hrs this evening. I would guess about 7-8 miles south of Discovery Is.

grey
whales breakfasted leisurely in front of our neighbor's house (Saratoga Strait just west of Langley). Then they had dessert just in front of our house about 100 feet from shore.

Once again
J-Pod
was on the West side of San Juan Island, very spread out several miles between Eagle Point and Kanaka Bay. J-14 & new baby (J40) were slowly moving on their own, and J-1 Ruffles. Blackberry (J-27) was doing his best to imitate a submarine as he cruised by with only his dorsal fin showing for long periods of time. Sporadic vocalizations were faintly heard over the hydrophone.

We received a call from Carter Lake reporting a pod of 11
orcas
. They were observed from a plane, 1200' above the whales, & said the whales were traveling in a tight, football-shaped pod, off the Sea Ranch Coast, Northern Sonoma County, CA, ~30 miles south of Pt. Arena heading north. They didn't see any other orcas in the area, but had seen some grays during the day as well. He commented that the dorsal fins looked straighter, less curved than resident fins.
*

8:20 a.m
. Hood Canal
Transients
were sighted across the Canal from Mike's Resort in front of Holly. They were moving quite fast. It was a calm morning and I could hear them blow all the way across the Canal. They were headed North.

Sam Cole of Island Adventures relayed a call they received today about a
gray
whale with something "squarish" on top of it, which could be a possible entanglement of some kind. The whale was sighted off Dallas Bank, north of Protection Island (north of Discovery Bay), SW bound. If anyone sees this whale, please let us know & call Cascadia Research at 1-800-747-7329.
