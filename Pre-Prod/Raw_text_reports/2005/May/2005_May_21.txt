Orca Sightings for May 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
transient
orcas were sighted by us and the neighbors at

5:00pm
. They were located along the east side of the canal about 1 mile north of Little Anderson Creek. Or straight east of Hazel Point on Toandos Peninsula. They maintained the same location for over a half-hour, but in the rain we had to give up watching them. There were at least four - seen at the same time - but there may have been more. We were thrilled since they had not been this far north all these months.

.

15.30-17.30hrs
. Four
Orca
. One adult. One sub adult and two juvenile. Judging by size. I saw the largest throw a seal into the air and the other three converge on the spot where the seal landed. Appeared to be having fun playing with the carcass but did not toss it in the air any time thereafter. Continued to stay in the area alternately diving for periods of up to 7 minutes then returned to same area and just playing. Unable to see the final direction of travel due to rain. It was also hard to find marking. They did not stay surfaced or would all surface in some sort of gaggle. Prior to seeing the whales a lot of the seals in the area between Anderson Landing and Seabeck left the area or stayed close to shore in shallow areas between the deep water and themselves. One seal surfaces directly in front or my boat, came completely out of the water before diving. Going a little faster I would have had company. Seen at 47.41.03N, 122.45.18W, .8 Mi SE of Hazel Pt. light, .7 Mi SW of range light at Olympic View, S of Bangor Spit. I was 1.2 miles SW at Anderson Landing. I have seen Orca in Hood Canal before. Some time between 1956-58 Summer in the Hazel Pt. area and around Oak Head.
