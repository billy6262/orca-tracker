At

3:10pm
we sighted five [HC
transients
] swimming north in mid-channel directly off of Hoodsport. There were two boats nearby. The five turned and went went south and the boats followed. But they again changed direction underwater (they got away from the boats) and headed north mid channel on the surface in a tight group. The five occasionally shifted to swimming together side by side in a parallel line. A sixth large Orca was much further away from the five and much closer to shore, directly in front of the Finch Creek hatchery. They (at least 5 of them) traveled casually towards Cougar Spit then north to Red Bluff on the east side of the canal. The Orcas and boat disappeared from view to the north at approx
3:45pm.
