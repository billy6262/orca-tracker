Orca Sightings for May 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two
orcas
were spotted off near Seal Rock, south of Newport, Oregon. They were milling and less than 3 miles off shore.

A dozen (or so)
orcas
came through Active Pass today around

4:00 PM
. Twice a day we see standing waves for ~30 min just east of Helen Point, but it is rare to see the orcas and the standing waves at the same time. Today there was a rare conjunction of the two, and as the orcas approached, they put on quite a show. Remaining at the surface, there was a fair bit of tail-lobbing, an occasional spy-hop, and a magnificent breach as they traversed the standing waves. Once they made it past this hazard, the current was with them and they floated on the surface, seemingly getting a free ride through the remainder of Active Pass.

10:30 am
this morning the "
Slippery Six
" were at the mouth of Dabob Bay making their way over to Oak Head, the tip of the Toanados Peninsula. The whales turned into shore towards Misery Point and the Skiers made their way over to the beach at Oak Head. They passed the marker at Misery Point headed north. They were very close to shore. Judy picked them up at Big Beef Creek and said that they were headed up to Bangor.

J-Pod
is passing my house right now (

10:43 am
, west San Juan Island) and what a beautiful sight--all the pod is grouped very tightly, moving North past Sunset Point towards Open Bay. They are hugging the shore very closely, in almost a resting pattern.
