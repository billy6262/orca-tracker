Orca Sightings for May 31, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I would like to report sighting the
transients
in Hood Canal around
2pm
. We were returning from conducting seabird surveys in Hood Canal near Bangor when we observed two female adults, what appeared to be three sub-adults, and one juvenile. The two adults were breaching and moving back and forth approximately 300 meters offshore from the younger orcas that were very near shore off of Tskutsko Pt. The younger orcas were very active, doing flips, rolls, and tail slaps. At first we thought they were just playing but discovered fresh mammal lungs floating on the surface soon after the pod moved north into Dabob Bay and concluded that they had been feeding. This was our first sighting of these whales and much to our dismay no one had a camera on board that day.
