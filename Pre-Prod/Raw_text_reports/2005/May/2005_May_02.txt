Spotted the Slippery Six, Hood Canal
Transients
, up at Oak Head, the tip of the Toanados Peninsula today at 3pm heading south. They passed by Maple Beach and Scenic Beach State Park mid channel and made a possible kill at Quatsap point. The six were mostly in travel mode but we did observe them having some fun with a couple of breaches by the adults and headstands by the younger whales. Great fun. Lost sight of them around
4pm
. making their way south.

Heading out of Victoria we heard that Victor (
T61
) had been picked up a little to the west of Chatham Island and was heading north. When we arrived at about
1130hrs
he was working on a seal that he had just killed, giving us a great view. He made his way north towards 10 Mile Point but doubled back in the middle of Baines Channel. On our return route to Victoria we managed to get a look at T61 again as he headed SW off Trial Island. On our next trip we picked him (T61) up again some 3 - 4 miles NE of Race Rocks (1400hrs) in the heavy mist and rain and followed him for a few miles as he approached Race. Having gone on to check out Whirl Bay we had a good look at him as he rounded the south tip of Race Rocks and headed West past Church Island at around
1600hrs
.
Perfect west coast whale watching.

We saw
T61
today! He was between Trial and Discovery Islands when we met up with him and was traveling southwest at a good clip while we were with him. Just as we were leaving the scene, a minke surfaced near us! We also saw two, maybe three minkes off Salmon Bank earlier in the day where we caught a few whiffs of them.
