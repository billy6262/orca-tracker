Vicki Doyle called at
8 pm
to report a single male
orca
off Deadman's Bay, west San Juan Island. Behind him she saw a Pacific White-sided dolphin flip upside down in the air, so she was wondering if it might be transients out there. She called back at
8:30 pm to report they were now seeing more orcas, but VERY spread out, only 1 or 2 here & there, traveling 1/2 hour apart, heading south. There have been earlier reports of J's spreading out like this recently, so it's likely them?
