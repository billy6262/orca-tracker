Around
noon
there was a pod of
orcas
in Neah Bay. There were at least two bulls, 4-6 cows and/or juveniles. They were at a distance, so I could not see much in the way of distinguishing marks, but one bull looked like he had a raggedly-notched trailing edge of his dorsal. At the same time, there was at least a half-dozen California sea lions in the marina feeding on halibut carcasses that the recreational fishermen were throwing into the water (in great quantity). The sea lions were really vocalizing. I guess if orcas were transients, they might have come in the harbor to investigate the sea lion activity. Or they were just curious residents.

My wife saw at least 3 of the Slippery Six Hood Canal
Transient
Orca pod at

8:50am
. This visual observation occurred approximately 300 feet south of Cougar Spit (across from Hoodsport) on the East side of the canal and about 300 feet offshore. She observed three Orcas swimming in a line, they submerged then she saw three Orcas surface again all were heading north.
