*
At the Coal Docks (near Pt. Roberts), just when we were going to give up and go home, who comes to greet us but
J-1
RUFFLES! Leading the group, he came by the boat to give us a long, slow pass, and as he got to the front of the boat gave us a nice tail lob to say goodbye. A young juvenile member (couldn't see the patch from the sunlight) did a double breach too! Granny was closer into shore so we just watched her from a distance.
