Orca Sightings for May 18, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was almost

12:30 PM
, on Possession Ridge. looking east as usual at south Mukilteo, the train line, and the southern end of Saratoga Passage. A large white circle remained on the surface of the water, directly in the wake of the white boat. It had been a breach, and for several minutes we watched as two whales breached several times, sometimes headed north, sometimes aimed right at us. We knew there were two whales because between the breaches we could make out two distinct blows. I wonder if I witnessed a humpback

Great day today. We went west of Trial Island off Victoria to find a
transient
. It may have been T61, headed west. Then we caught
JPod
on the way home around South Lopez. We had just enough time to watch them all go bye and even see a couple cartwheels.

I received a call from George Peterson from the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab who was at the Saltwater Park boat launch area. At
11.06 am
he saw one
orca
surfacing in the middle of Annas Bay that appeared to be heading north. At 11.10 am George saw 3 orcas a little more north at the fresh water stream outlet.

We had a single
Gray
feeding just off Spee-Bi-Dah last night, at

7:10 pm
. Too rainy to tell which Gray it was. It continued to feed working slowly north for about 35 Minutes.

Jamie in Port Townsend called in a report of a
gray
whale north of Pt. Wilson, but then wasn't sure if it might be a humpback.
*
Carol Fassett called in a report of the
Slippery Six
heading past Toanados Peninsula in the middle of the Canal, through 10-12 stationary shrimp boats
*
Hood Canal
Transients
passed by Maple Beach again heading north at

5:30pm
in a slow travel mode. They wandered over to Oak Head where I lost them in the mist heading north.

We have seen the Hood Canal
orcas
5 days in a row off of Cougar Spit now. I didn't report yesterdays or today's sightings as I have been so busy and they were brief sightings. Today's sighting was in the midst of shrimp season and the boats were running right on top of them probably without realizing they were there.
