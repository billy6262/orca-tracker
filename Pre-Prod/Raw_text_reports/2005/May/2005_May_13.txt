4 miles out of Active Pass, at

Hood Canal
Transients
passed by Maple Beach in travel mode this evening at

6:15pm

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report 1
gray
whale (#723) by Camano Head at

2:30 pm
, heading toward Hat Island.

All six (Hood Canal)
transients
put on quite a show today around
1pm
, near Lilliwaup. We saw over 20 breaches, spy-hopping, porpoising, you name it. Around 2, the hydrophone went silent and the whales gave us the slip, presumably in hunting mode.
*
The
slippery six
were heading north at a leisurely pace just south of Ayok Beach at
1PM
.
Jeni Gray
Hood Canal
*
On the Ebey's Landing bluff (west Whidbey) this
am
saw what he thinks was an
orca
, a dorsal out toward Fort Worden.
Rowena Williamson
Coupeville

Word from Hannah at Kayak Rentals, Union, that at
10.00 am
she saw
the six
heading towards Potlatch. They were on the surface quite a while doing both pec and tail slaps and appeared to just be in a relaxing mode of travel basically moving to the north. Hannah also said a neighbor had them right in front of his house where they got a seal under his dock! Did not give any more specifics like time/location etc.

Around

8:30
, with calm waters, those sneaky
J's
tried to hug the shoreline past the house again. Well, except for Ruffles, who was tooling along by himself heading North past Low Island (west side San Juan Island).
John Boyd (JB)
Marine Naturalist

Saw a
grey
whale feeding about 50 yards from the Clinton dock while waiting for the
730am
sailing. The cars were still being loaded and it surfaced on the northeast side. Then about 5 minutes later it surfaced on the south side of boat while it was underway.
