For the third day in a row we watched the Hood Canal
Slippery Six
from our place on the eastern shore across from Hoodsport on Hood Canal. At
5pm
at Cougar Spit at least five of the Slippery Six were observed swimming south about 100 yards offshore. They disappeared from view, but twenty minutes later they returned were very close to shore, only about 50 feet off the beach directly in front of Cougar Spit. The larger Orcas spy hopped a couple times and the smaller ones were rolling and tail slapping. Lots of other activity too, swimming quickly back and forth in a tight group and staying up high on the surface. They eased their way north until they passed Red Bluff and disappeared from view around
5:35pm.
