Orca Sightings for May 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approx
2pm
we saw the
Slippery Six
directly off of Cougar Spit about 50 yards from the eastern shore. They were traveling north. The water was choppy and windy with many whitecaps. The Orcas were surfacing at a steep angle, breathing with very visible blows and submerging for about 5 minutes before re-surfacing. They all disappeared from view towards the north at about
2:20pm
