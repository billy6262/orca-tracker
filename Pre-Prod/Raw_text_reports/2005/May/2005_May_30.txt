My family and I saw a pod of 7 or 8 whales that were black or very dark gray. We don't know what type of whales they were but they looked very similar to a porpoise except they were larger. They appeared to be feeding on fish. We saw them from our back yard in West Seattle looking across to Vashon Island. They had triangular fins on their backs, but not as tall as that of the Orcas. It was small and very triangular. We never could see any white on them. We got out the binoculars but still didn't see white. They seemed like they were "fishing" in the channel, sorta "hovering" in the same place for awhile. We could see fish jumping out of the water in front of them. I'm going to guess that it was either a False Killer Whale or a Pilot Whale sighting? Is that possible? We watched them for about an hour on two separate days - the last being on Monday (
May 29) morning about 9 a.m. We saw a school of porpoise on Monday,
May 30 as well. They were tiny in comparison.

I wonder if this might be the pod of transient orcas seen in this area recently? although no white was seen by this reporter.....sb
