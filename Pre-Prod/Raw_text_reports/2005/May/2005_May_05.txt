4:20 p.m. Hood Canal Slippery Six
are headed North about 1 mile North of Hama Hama on the Holly side of the Canal. For awhile they seemed to be going in circles--must have been feeding or playing. I believe I saw the baby. I was using my spotting scope and it brought them up close.

passed right through the reflection of the
