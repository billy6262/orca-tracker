Orca Sightings for December 16, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was waiting to take the ferry from Talequah to Point Defiance around

3:30 p.m
. I observed approximately 10-12 [
orcas
] traveling east to west in about mid-channel. They were approximately 1/2 mile off shore. I believe there were at least two from the larger size of their fins. The pod continued around the south end of Vashon and as they rounded the point turned to the north going into Colvos Passage. They appeared to be heading somewhere as they did not stray from that route. A second pod of between 4 and 6 followed the same path, approximately 2 miles behind (10 minutes or so). I could not tell whether this had any males as the sun was now very low and sightings were difficult.
