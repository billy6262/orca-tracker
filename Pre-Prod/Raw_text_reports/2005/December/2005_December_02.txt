Orca Sightings for December 2, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

10:45 AM
on the Vashon to Fauntleroy ferry we sighted a pod of 6 or more
Orca
. There were two babies swimming with larger whales. The pod was spread accross the ferry lane and we got some close looks at one another.
