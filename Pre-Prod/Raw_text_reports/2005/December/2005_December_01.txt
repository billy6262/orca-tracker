Orca Sightings for December 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Elsa Leavitt called at

10:30 am
to report a pod of ~20
orcas
, just south of Bush Pt, heading south close to the Whidbey side. She said there were several adult males (J pod now has several "sprouter" males whose fins are pretty big, so it could be J's or ???).
*
Virgina Lindsey called to report whales at Bush Pt. at

10:25 am
, & also sent in this report: A pod of
orcas
is heading south-about 15 or so. I have never seen so many of them so close to shore. Going around the point it seemed as though they would hit bottom.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to relay a report of a pod of
orcas
observed from the air, off Ft. Flagler around

9:15 am
or so.

It was another wonderful crossing on the Port Townsend to Keystone Washington State Ferry. At least 20
orcas
were encountered about mid strait at

8:15 am
. Lots of tail and fin slapping, spy hopping and some breaching. They were heading east-southeast. The ferry almost came to a complete stop as the whales surrounded us. Some came up right beside the boat and provided everyone with a great view.
