Orca Sightings for December 22, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Beautiful treat to encounter a pod of
orcas
on today's Keystone noon sailing (Thursday) to Port Townsend. Pod was mid channel at

12:15 pm
heading south. Two prominent males visible. Merry Christmas to all.
