Orca Sightings for January 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a pod of about 12
orcas
(including 2 young ones) swim down Tumbo Channel from North to South. It was around
noon
. They appeared to be feeding.

Watched a very small group of
orcas
heading NW from Hanna Heights this afternoon,

1:45pm
. They were milling approx. 1 mile from shore when I first spotted them. Five minutes later they began moving rapidly NW. I ran to Limekiln, but did not pick up anything on the hydrophones as they went by, but they were getting to be quite far off shore. I was unable to get even a remote id and did not see any distinct adult male whales.

Just enjoyed watching a pod of
orcas
pass by here in the north end of Colvos passage at

2:25 PM
. They are heading north without pause, now just beyond Vashon Island. Counted at least a dozen in the pod, spread out nearly a mile from front to back.
