Orca Sightings for January 28, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found the orcas about
11.20 am
just off Hoodsport in the middle of the channel. We followed them along Hwy 101 and at about 12.15pm the whales were at the bluffs north of Lilliwaup. All six were really traveling; low in the water and with only 3 - 5 blows before doing some long deep underwater speed-racing (it seemed) to the north. They were closer to the west shore originally and then moved out more to the center near Eagle Creek. Behavior was about the same most of the time with little change except an occasional split of a couple of the older ones from the other four for just a few surface runs.

4 whales headed south moving fast. Still to far out to identify any markings or get pictures.
