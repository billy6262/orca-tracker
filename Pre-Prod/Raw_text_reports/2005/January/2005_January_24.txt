I received a report that three
orcas
stayed in the same area for about 2 hrs off Holiday Beach Resort (north of Hoodsport) on west side of Hood canal. This info came from people who own a resort south of Hoodsport who were great "informers" for Chris and me last time. The whales' location was about 1 mile north of them they said. Just a few minutes ago Chris called to say a guy from the WDFW Fishery (also Hoodsport) reported seeing whales near Dewatto (east side of canal) about
3.00pm
or thereabouts which would indicate it possibly was the same whales. He also said he noticed there were many gulls around so believed they made a kill... the first real indication they could be transients.

Group of killer whales spotted in Hood Canal
By Christopher Dunagan, Sun Staff
A group of at least six killer whales was observed in Hood Canal today, and excited residents were hoping they would stay for a long visit.
Two of the orcas had tall dorsal fins, she said, suggesting they were adult males.
