At
1 pm
we were able to see some breaches, lunges, tail lobs, & a spout or two in the distance through our spotting scope. These were the
orcas
as they exited Holmes Harbor, & were heading toward Camano Island then SE down Saratoga Passage. They are likely the same pod reported later in the day off S Whidbey.

Orcas
in the middle of Saratoga Passage Off of Mabana at
l:39pm
. The glare off of the water made it difficult to follow them looking directly into the sun from Camano Island.

Orcas
whales swimming around the Clinton ferry Dock. Heading south what towards the south but they are real close to the dock.

1/2 mile south of Glendale, S. Whidbey Island, heading south.
*

3:40 pm
Jay Freeze called & reported
orcas
heading south from Possession Pt, SW Whidbey Island, close to shore.
*
We spotted 6-8
Orca
moving south into Holmes Harbor at about
10 a.m
. this morning. We've been watching since and haven't seen them come back out yet. We are located just north of Honeymoon Bay and south of Dines Point. There appeared to be at least one male, they were traveling fast into the Harbor on the water surface. Just south of us, they stopped and milled around, then stayed submerged except for coming up for air for a duration of about 20 minutes. Then they came back up again as a group and moved quickly towards Freeland. This sighting made our day! We didn't think that Orca came this deep into Holmes Harbor.

Just watched the
pod
move north out of Holmes Harbor at

11:30
. They were travelling quickly. We saw one large male, another with what appeared to be a grayish "saddle" marking across the back, and what was definitely a very young whale. There may have been two youngsters, it was hard to tell, they were traveling fast and not on the surface much.
