Orca Sightings for January 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just wanted to report a sighting of
Orca
whales near Seattle WA. We first saw them around
2pm
. The pod seemed to be just milling about very close to the Elliot Bay Marina. We counted at least 8, but there could have easily been more. They were slapping their tails, and did quite a bit of jumping when they were near the marina. After about an hour, they all started heading north, along the Magnolia Bluff. There was at least 1 very large whale (much larger fin) with a chip out of the top.

This definitely sounds like the pod of Transient orcas with male T87 - SB

At approx.

2:55 PM
I saw a group of about 3-6
orcas
from the cliff/hill above the Kingston Ferry Terminal. The orcas were in between the point nearest Kingston (Brigadine) and Presidents point. They were not much more than a 1/4 mile off the shore (maybe even 1/8), but I was watching from well over a mile away. Not much activity mostly just the normal blowing, but therewas one majestic breach that was amazing! They were heading south towards Point Jefferson.

Just saw a group of ~8
orcas
while making coffee this morning. They were close enough to spot them without the binoculars! About

8:30 am
~ 3/4 mile north of the Edmonds ferry dock, heading south at a fast pace. Probably 150-200 yards off shore.

LuAnn Fortin called to report a pod of 6 or 7
orcas
, including one male, between Bush Pt. & Double Bluff on W. Whidbey this morning at

10:40 am
, heading south.
Then she sent us this update:
The pod I reported early via phone was larger than the pod we saw yesterday. There were at least 2 males and one calf. They were spread out over a greater distance and there were probably 10 -15 whales. They were not in a hurry and we got to enjoy spy-hopping, tail slapping and some mulling around.
