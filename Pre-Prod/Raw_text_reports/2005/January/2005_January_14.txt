Orca Sightings for January 14, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the afternoon from about

2:30 to 4 pm
, a pod of
orcas
hung out off the N.W. corner of Camano Island (Rocky Point) across from Coupeville. They were off shore enough that I could see them with just eyes, but binoculars made them much easier to see. They were spread out and not in a hurry to go any where. I saw 5 breaches. Slowly they headed south and farther away from shore. I couldn't see any identifying details about who they were. Maybe 7-9 whales? At least one male.

Connie Barrett of Camano Island reported a pod of 13 - 15
orcas
in Saratoga Passage heading past the State Park going north, splashing & swimming.

We followed
K pod
up Saragota Passage, & found them at the very northern end of the passage, near the entrance to Penn Cove at

3:45 pm
. They were off in the distance & we had to catch the ferry, so we couldn't tell where they were going to head from there.

We finally caught up with the whales in Saratoga Passage! Just missed them at East Pt, as they had already passed & were heading north at

12:30 pm

Howie 3 saw or 4 whales & was able to get a closer look at one with a very clear wide open saddle like Jan. 14 We finally caught up with the whales in Saratoga Passage! Just missed them at East Pt, as they had already passed & were heading north at

Elsa Leavitt called at

to report a sighting of 2+
orcas
from the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry, closer to the Clinton side. She saw two smaller females swimming north fairly rapidly, and more splashes further north, but didn't have binocs to see how many others may have been around.
