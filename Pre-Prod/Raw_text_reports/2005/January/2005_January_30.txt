Orca Sightings for January 30, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
A group of 7-9
orcas
(one with a really large dorsal fin) appeared to be foraging/fishing? in Swanson Channel off Mouat Point, North Pender Island, between

1:30 and
3:30pm
. They were quite far out so I couldn't get any other identifiers. They swam in the same area for all of that time, just going back and forth, sometimes at great speed. A neighbour reported what she thought was a pursuit of a sea lion.

Transient
T87 with a group of 6 - 8 Transients heading north past the Center, west San Juan Island, at

8:20 am
.

Mallard and Ian on Natural Salty reported that T20,T21, T109, T109A, 109B and T109C (
Transient orcas
) made a kill at
1408
near Constance Bank South of Victoria. The amount of flesh and stuff in the water would indicate a Steller. They were last seen at
1545
heading in the direction of Race Rocks.
