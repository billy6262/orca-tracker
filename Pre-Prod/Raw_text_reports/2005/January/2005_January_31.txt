Orca Sightings for January 31, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I forgot to mention to you that on my sighting at

4:30
Ayock Point has a very nice gravel beach and the whales were rolling around in the gravel. I could see them from my cabin deck and by the time that I got there to see if I could get some pictures they were headed off north.

*
At least 2
Orcas
headed north off of Ayock point at

3:45
. They were in the middle of the canal fairly far apart of each other. Spouting about 4 or 5 times and then looks like the are taking a long dive.

North from Hoodsport at about

3:45
. Saw our first sighting of "cars" at Jorsted Creek.
Orcas
were working their way North and they were currently just South of the creek's delta. Within about ten minutes we saw our first blow and two of the smaller Orcas surface. By around
4:30 they were half way up that small delta area. They were, East of center, in the Canal. I saw at least two, but there could have been three.

(Hood Canal
Transients
). The
2.30pm
... they rounded Musqueti Pt (SW Kitsap Peninsular)... I did however see more blows perhaps as far as Red Bluff (east side). Several of us later were at the bluffs north of Lilliwaup and we determined the transients possibly moved closer to the west (Hwy 101) side and more into the sun which we were facing. Just beyond Eagle Creek I caught up with a couple who had been watching with me earlier and they said three were more in mid-channel and three closer to the western shoreline at about
3.15pm
(these folk said that they have had great viewing from the Hoodsport Marina and the whales seem to put on a show if people are there to watch!!!! Spy-hops, lots of breaching and just playful... in their words.... I moved up to Jorstad Creek. I managed to catch sight of two blows as they came parallel with Ayock Pt. another fan beside me saw a separate blow so we figured it was one of the two three-somes. Then we got more company and orca fans who eventually helped us find the blows which were nearer to the east side. Harry Louch, from Hoodsport, another Orca Network volunteer, also picked up some of these faint and infrequent sightings which we remarked appeared to be the smaller animals of the group at about
4.00pm +
.
