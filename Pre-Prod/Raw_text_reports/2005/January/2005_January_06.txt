Orca Sightings for January 6, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just as I passed the Edmonds ferry landing I came across several
Orcas
, stretched out about a mile or so. Starting about the refinery holding tanks by Edmonds stretching northwest up the waterway. I got glimpses of at least one male off in the distance and several females, one in which did have a very small youngster. They were heading north/northwest. The time was around

11:00 am
.
