Orca Sightings for January 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

10:15 pm
as we were going to bed, we heard LARGE whales - one or two sounded like they were directly below your home, and another one below Chuck's home... they seemed to be close to shore, and sounded just like the gray whales we see in Spring. Or were they orcas? Did you hear or see them?

A spread-out group of around 8
orcas
are going by the house as we speak. We're on the north end of Edmonds, and the whales are in between us and Point-No-Point, heading north.

We just watched 2-3
orcas
travelling north along Maury Island at about

12:10 pm
. Saw them through our telescope from our house Brown's Point. They were west of the mid-channel marker. Very exciting because this are our first solid siting of orcas since we moved here four years ago!
