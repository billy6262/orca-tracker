Orca Sightings for January 10, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
While on the ferry from Friday Harbor to Anacortes, there was an announcement that
Orcas
were on the right side of the ferry about 15 min. around

1:30 PM
before we reached Anacortes. I never saw them, and haven't seen a report here of any there that day, but would assume the ferry captain would not have made the announcement if they weren't there.

Amy Carey called to report the
orcas
off Vashon Island had passed close by Pt. Robinson & were heading south at
1 pm
. She called at
3:30 pm to say they had been ID'd as K pod, & were continuing to travel south.

At

9:55am
I spotted a pod of
Orcas
playing with an infant Orca in front of my house. I counted 9 dorsal fins circling the north end of Strawberry Island on their way out Deception Pass. The pod seemed to be resting and feeding while the baby nursed. The neighbors reported an Orca sighting last year.

We just saw at least 8
orcas
heading south along the east side of Vashon between Dolphin Point and Dilworth, at about

10:35
.
