Spotted what appeared to be part of the
L-12's early this morning
off of Balcomb Reef (Sunset Point). We heard a rumor of whales in Rosario Channel, so off we went to find them, and find them we did! All three pods (J's, K's, & L's less L-12's) were south of Bird Rocks by the time we managed to get on scene. The whales were in groups of 6-8, traveling fairly slowly at first. When we dropped the hydrophone, we were treated to a non-stop 30 minute whale "orca-stra" serenade.
