Orca Sightings for October 10, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am reporting an
orca
sighting off Yeomalt Point, Bainbridge Island. There were about 15 to 20 orcas. They were travelling south at about

5:00pm or
6:00pm
. The little orcas were playing and the larger orcas were probably feeding on salmon. I think we saw a male feeding.

About
5 PM
we saw what must have been 10 - 20
orcas
between Bainbridge Island and Seattle. They stayed for about an hour. There were also many very big net fishing boats in the vicinity at the time as have been for the last several days.
Sincerely, Ems
