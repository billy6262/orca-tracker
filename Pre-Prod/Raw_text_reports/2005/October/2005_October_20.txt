Orca Sightings for October 20, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out on Cutty Sark with Mrs. Foss' 6th grade Life Skills class and we saw a
Gray Whale
just off Harrington Lagoon (Penn Cove, Whidbey Isl) about

12:30
. It was a great thrill for the students as the whale went right under the ship and turned on it's side to wave!
