Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to relay a report from Chris Sly of Bainbridge Island - Chris had sighted approx. 6
orcas
, including 2 males, near West Pt. north of Seattle at

4:45 pm
. They were traveling south at a fast pace.
*
I spotted a pod of
Orcas
about a mile off of Golden Gardens around

3:30pm
. They were very active, it looked like they might have been fishing. I saw a lot of breaching, sometimes two or more at a time. The pod worked the area for about 10-minutes then headed south towards Bainbridge. I think there was about 5 or 6 in the pod.
