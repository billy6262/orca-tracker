at the north end of Poverty Bay, south of Des Moines (so. Seattle), heading south at
8 am
. They saw at least 8, heading south (with one of the trailing animals heading north). He reported the fins all appeared to be the same size, but he thought they were too large to be porpoise, though he could not see their blows. He reported seeing a similar pod on Thursday as well.
