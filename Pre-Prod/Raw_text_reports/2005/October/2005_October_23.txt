between

12:25 &
12:35 pm
, heading west toward Bainbridge Island

A pod of
orcas
was sighted from the Bainbridge ferry run around

11:45
. Apparently the whales were ahead of and to the north of the ferry when the crew spotted them. Whales were inside the outer edge of Elliott Bay, initially travelling west (counter direction to the ferry, maybe 200-400 yds north of it), then south (400 yds+ behind it). There seemed to be at least 4 females and young, ahead of an adult male by several hundred yards. They didn't seem to be feeding or playing, just traveling.
