Orca Sightings for October 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
L pod
at Turn Point heading north - rambunctiously making their way towards the Canadian Gulf Islands. Report was that J's and K's had gone up ahead of them into Boundary Pass. A nice surprise close pass by L57 thrilled everyone, and L78 and L79 were close by. They generally put on a great show: lots of cartwheels, spyhops, rolling around, upside down, mini-breaches, porpoising, tail lobs, calves playing. Whales that looked fat and happy, playful, content and vigorous.
