Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reports sighting a
gray
whale around the Dugualla Bay area (no. of Saratoga Passage) the past few days.
*
Gray
whale (possibly Freddy?) sighted off of Pile Point just north of False Bay today. The whale was about 1/4 mile from shore.

Today we were taking the Edmonds to Kingston ferry run (western bound,

3:50
pm run), one male foraging out about 500 yards of the stern of the boat. At first it appeared as if there was one, then later we noticed two, and then towards the end another two surfaced (definitly different from the first two) and all four began heading south towards Shoreline along the Edmonds water front. Oh and there was one magnificant breach were everyone kind of held their breath (boy they seem to be in the air for about 2 minutes) it was pretty cool.

Fred Felleman called to report the
orcas
had begun to reach his neighborhood, near Ballard, & were spread out from there to Pt. Wells, still heading south on the mainland side.

We jumped in the car with binocs & camera after receiving John Herman's report (see below) of
orcas
heading east down the west side of Whidbey Island. We got to Scatchet Head at approx.

1:30
, & found the whales very spread out, heading SE. By
2:30 they were closer to the Edmonds side, though still very far from view & impossible to ID or count, but there were dozens of whales, likely J &/or K pods (Ken Balcomb reported L's had been seen off Sooke, S. Vancouver Island, heading west earlier in the day). At first we weren't sure if they were going to head south or north up Possession Sound, but by
2:45 they were off Pt. Wells, still heading south & still closer to the Edmonds side.

John Herman called at

12:30
to report a pod of
orcas
mid-strait near Useless Bay (SW Whidbey Island) heading east. He was following them from the Peninsula side - we headed out immediately to see if we could find & possibly ID them. John called again at about 1 pm to say the whales had nearly reached Pt. No Pt.
