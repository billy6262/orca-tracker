rounding Pt. No Pt. at a little after

, & said they were headed across Useless Bay closer to the Whidbey side. They passed close to Double Bluff, but it was dark by the time they got to Bush Pt.
*
I found the whales (
J pod
) from Scatchet Head, S. Whidbey Island - they were WAY over by the Peninsula, coming around Apple Cove Pt. north of Kingston with what looked like a research zodiac with them.. They were heading toward Pt. No Pt. at about

4:20 pm
, VERY spread out.
