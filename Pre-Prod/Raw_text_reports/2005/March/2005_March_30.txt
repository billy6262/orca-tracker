Orca Sightings for March 30, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

5:45 PM
two
grays
(one adult, one youngster) passed by my Langley office, travelling through Saratoga Passage at a liesurely pace toward Sandy Point. They were being followed by more than two dozen ducks that seemed to be quite interested in what they were stirring up in the water. Later that evening, at

8:45PM
I heard spouts outside my window--it was too dark to see how many whales were passing by. The sounds seemed to procede in the same direction (west to east).
*
Derrick Whitmarsh of Camano Island called to report a
gray
whale going north in Saratoga Passage near Pebble Beach just before
4 pm
, across from Langley.
*
Connie Barrett of Camano Island called to report a couple of
gray
whales north of Camano Isl. State Park, actively feeding in circles on the surface about 300 yards offshore at

10:30 am
. A small boat was approaching the whales.

Whales in our bay most of the this week. Past by this morning going North about

8:00am
