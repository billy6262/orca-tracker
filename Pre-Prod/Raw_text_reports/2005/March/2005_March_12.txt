Orca Sightings for March 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tracy Diller reported seeing what looked to them like a
Minke
whale, E. of the Keystone ferry, Whidbey Island, traveling west. They watched it surface every few minutes, & said it had a small dorsal fin. They saw it at

1:30 &
4:30
pm, 150' offshore.
*
Judy and her husband found the HC
transients
about

2:40 PM
just East of Potlatch State Park and Tacoma City Lights boat launch area. About center of the Bend, off Tahuya, feeding. I saw at least three from my deck. However with the white caps and the distance it is hard to tell. There is a white boat, respecting their space, watching. Hopefully they will send in a report as they have a ring side seat. There is a lot of slashing going on with tail slaps.

gray
whale traveling off the west side of Whidbey Island today. They first found it SW of Admiralty Head, & left it 1 mile north of Bush Pt at

2:10
pm, heading south at a pretty good rate.
