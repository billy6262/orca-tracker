Orca Sightings for March 24, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Carol from Glen Ayr Resort had called to say the
transients
were traveling north from opposite Glen Ayr at approx
9.20 am
. Sometime later they were seen milling about with lots of rolling over each other, various types of breaching which continued for about 30 min. and drew quite a crowd! Carol thought they had possibly made a kill but saw no seabirds.

On the east side of Whidbey, just north the Possesion Point "marina". We spotted the plumes, and saw flukes indicating deeper dives, they were in the same place, only earlier, perhaps

10:00 AM
. Cruisin' along, plumes and humps visible, and then up come the flukes and down they go. Then they are out of our line of sight.

8:55 pm
to report at least 2
gray
whales blowing & splashing at East Pt, very close to shore.

We had the chance to observe an adult
Minke
whale at Hein Bank this afternoon. The animal was behaving in the usual Minke pattern of zig zagging around a rather large area. Possible second Minke though not confirmed.

I followed Hood Canal
Transients
today. I spotted the HCT Orcas, all 6, in front of the Hoodsport Winery at about

10:45 a.m
. They appeared to be hunting, but no seagulls feeding. Jumping, splashing, rolling, tail stands and tail slaps. They were in a very playful mood for the three hours I followed them. They were moving North against the incoming tide. They stayed mainly in the center of the canal. However, around

1:20 p.m
. they came over to West side or HWY 101 side of the canal. They were jumping straight out of the water, falling back, normal diving jumps, rolling, tail slaps and stands. One was even floating on it's back! Just being happy, playful Orcas. Once the show was over they started their power swim. Last seen at the Hamma Hamma Oyster Farm heading North.

We received a call from Celeste at the Depoe Bay Whale Ctr. in OR, relaying a report from the Lewis & Clark Interp. Ctr. at Ilwaco, reporting 4 - 5

between the jetties, traveling east up toward the Columbia River at

11:30 am

We watched the 3
orca
whales moving north on Hood Canal from just north of Hoodsport, WA and followed them to the area south of Lilliwap where the Tides resturant is and they were still going North. It was a delight to see them playing and breaching and rolling in the water. The water was very calm, and they were being viewed by many along hiway 101. The time was about

10:45 am
.

At
0900 until 0945
observed 5 or 6
Orcas
about mid-channel of Hood Canal. I was on Highway 106 about 1/4 mile west of Alderbrook Resort. I followed the Highway to the Union Marina and observed the Orcas until they turned North at Bald Point. During the initial observation I saw many birds milling around the water and what appeared to be a small head of a seal. The orca's were Spyhoping and rolling on their sides. I observed this thru a 50 power set of binoculars. After they finished with the seal they cruised away and made the big turn at the Great Bend in the Hood Canal.

I first saw the (
Transient
orca) group near Hoodsport about
11:3o AM
, closer to the opposite side of the canal. I went home to get my camera and found them heading north very slowly, eating, playing and taking advantage of the sunny day, pretty much oblivious to the human entourage of vehicles following them along highway 101!! I met one of your loyal posters, Harry Louch, at Eagle Creek about noonish where we discovered they had actually turned south again! We headed south on 101 about two or more miles to find them very close to shore! We then followed the Orca north again, and stopped at Jorstad Creek pulloff and watched them pass by in "travel' mode.
