Paul Shaumborg of Great Bend Charters in Union, Hood Canal, reported seeing the Hood Canal
Transients
at

7:52 pm
, all 6 of them spread out 3 miles north of Hamma Hamma, heading south, then crossed over to the Kitsap Penin. side still heading south at a good clip.
*
I have been gone all day and did not see them leave (
orcas
in Tacoma Narrows). The last time I saw them they were pointed south and moving very slowly about noon. I did not take any pictures. The young one seemed to us to be swimming on its side and rolling. The others never really came out of the water much.... just the one fin and then the breathing sounds.

gray
whales feeding and breathing close to shore off of Langley. They were headed south.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reported seeing two
Minke

I received a message from Kathy Cole of Seabeck (Kitsap Penin) that the
Slippery Six
were in sight traveling north in the Jackson Cove area (Dabob Bay) about
9.27 am
. At
4.30pm
the Slippery Six were still up north!!! and could be seen at the south end of the Toanados Penin. Kathy thought it was the same area she saw them in last Wed afternoon (Mar 23) with the NOAA team observing them.

We have been watching a pod of
orcas
all morning in the Tacoma Narrows. They seem to have a baby which they are tending. Keeping it at the surface every few minutes. There are about 10 of them although there could be more or less because they are hard to count. The baby shows lots of white and is obviously quite small. They have been in the same area since

8:00am until at least
11:15am
. Coming apparently from the south (I was asleep until
8:00... stupid me!) they are swimming right in front of my house just south of the Narrows bridge.
Mari in the south Sound

Wendy of Langley called to report 2
gray
whales at Sandy Pt, south of Langley at

12:10 pm
. They had come down from Saratoga Passage about 15 minutes earlier, & appeared to be hanging around feeding off Sandy Pt.
*

11:00 AM
, two
gray
whales are traveling south, mid channel between Langley and Camano.
