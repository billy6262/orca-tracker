feeding 100 to 150 yds off shore near the beach community of Spee-bi-dah. One whale was the one we named "TrimTail" 2 years ago. This the 3rd year we clearly ID this whale. Did not get a good look at the other.

So the
Humpbacks
have made it up to Nootka sound and beyond now. Three Humpback whales passed by only 100 meters from shore. There were two adult whales and one not fully matured travelling close together, investigating a bit, circling the bays, on their slow journey south. No flukes shown, shallow dives. I also heard from a couple of people who have been out flying that they saw quite a few whales offshore travelling to the NW.
