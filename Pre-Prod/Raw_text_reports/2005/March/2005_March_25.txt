Orca Sightings for March 25, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Twanoh State Park...the whales were surfacing just near the boat launch about
noon
. It looked like the two adult females were in front and the others sort of mingled together all moving east. About 5 or 10 mins later it seemed they then changed directions and did some lunging and arching dives and definitely appeared to be doing some serious chasing... almost towards the boat.... from all different directions. For almost 3 hrs the guys stuck with the whales when they could. Finally I got started back to the car about
3.30pm
and saw the boat coming west at a clip and then saw whales crossing the channel south to north behind them so set up my scope again and waved at the crew. They waited and I believe witnessed another possible kill mid-channel north of the park. The last time I saw them again maybe
4.30pm
patiently waiting for the Slippery Six to emerge between Union and Tahuya and sure enough The Six came by in traveling mode nearer the north shore.

Not one blow, but two in close succession, so most likely two whales--probably

9.20am
... Dick of Glen Ayr Resort (N. Hoodsport) called to say the
whales
were near the Kitsap Penin opposite them milling about. I told him Steve J., WDFW, Josh L. UW and Volker Deeke were lauching at Potlatch. 9.36am Dick reported they had traveled north slowly and were in the area of Holiday Resort. At 9.40am Kathy, of MAKINPICZ, called to say they were across the canal from of her house above the Tides Restaurant.....Holiday Beach area...and were passed Union heading towards Alderbrook Resort! ...they all quickly disappeared into the cove at Tahuya (I think) at approx.
11.00am
. At 11.35am the boat came out of the cove behind the
transients
heading steadily towards Twanoh State Park.

(not sure specific number) off Holiday Beach near Hoodsport. They were playing, mainly near the east side of the canal, and visible from our home for nearly 45 minutes at about

9:30 AM
. The orcas were headed south.

whales in Port Susan Sound at

8:45 am

This morning,

8:40 am
, one
gray
was spotted heading south between Tulalip Shores and the south end of Camano. At
9:00, two grays were spotted heading north in Port Susan, around the Spee-bi-dah area. Both sightings found the grays in the middle of Port Susan and too far away to identify. They were all moving along as with a purpose in mind, not feeding along the shores.
