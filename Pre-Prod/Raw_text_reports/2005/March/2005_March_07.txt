Orca Sightings for March 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just heard from a friend of a friend that there were a bunch of
Orcas
off of South Beach, south side of San Juan Island.

Nancy (a new orca fan contact) from the Oyster Farm at Beacon Point, said some
whales
were in the cove by them (to the south I believe) about
8.30 am
and then there were four others seen near Mike's Beach Resort at about 8.45 am. Another orca fan called in later to say the whales were near the bluffs north of Lilliwaup at
10.30 am
heading south towards Hoodsport. The last report had three of them passing 2 miles north of Hoodsport and still heading south at
11.30 am
.
