Well tonight, about
5 p.m.
, the Hood Canal
Orcas
were right in front of my house just South of Hoodsport. About mid-canal across from the Hoodsport Winery. It is very apparent after watching them for about an hour that in the "Orca World" it is O.K. to play with your food. There was a lot of diving activity, rolls, tail flashes, splashing, surfacing together, whales going to the right as whales went to the left. However in all the mealay I would occasionally see a small head surface with no sense of which way to go. It was to small for the baby Orca so I am sure it was a seal. Then an Orca would either surface from under it or dive onto it. Only to see the seal bob up again in a few minutes. They were still active at 6, but working their way North.
