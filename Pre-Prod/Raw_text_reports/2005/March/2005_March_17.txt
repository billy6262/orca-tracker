Orca Sightings for March 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
1pm
11-12
orcas
near Copalis N47deg15min and W124deg15min were seen traveling north. The group contained 2-3 calves. One whale which stayed at least a mile from the 50ft charter boat we were on appeared to be a mature male, but it was too far off to tell for sure. One whale breached twice, bringing cheers from the crowd, but mostly the pod was just traveling, some porpoising. One whale with a calf did some rolling at the surface. One whale approached our boat to within 30ft early during the encounter. Orcas have been seen before in the area, but only rarely.
