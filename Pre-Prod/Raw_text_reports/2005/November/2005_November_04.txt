Orca Sightings for November 4, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Debbie of Mutiny Bay, west Whidbey Island called to report sighting
orcas
at

3:15 pm
heading south, closer to the Peninsula/Hansville side. She could see at least 6 blows at a time, but they were too far away to get a good count.
*
Between

7:15 and
7:40 am
, saw fins (
orcas
) and activity close to the western shore of Blake Island (just north of Vashon Isl) but too far away to identify sex or identity. Thought I spotted a male fin but could not be sure. It seemed like it was only a couple of animals. Feeding very close to the shore, near the southwestern end of the island opposite Point Southworth. Seemed to be feeding on salmon. Were not clearly traveling in any direction, up and down the shore.
