Orca Sightings for November 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Only two boats out both had
humpbacks
off Victoria, one each. "Mallard" had
T103 and T104
off Beechey Head, after the humpbacks. "Natural Salty" on his way to the T's got a humpback further off shore and a second in Race Passage. While all this is going on at sea I had 4
humpbacks
off the Victoria waterfront from shore. So assuming 2 of my four were seen by the boats on their way out and 2 more by the boats west of Race as well as two transients, my other two were east of Race. Total 6 humpbacks and 2 transients this afternoon.

Bush Pt. at

10:45 am
from the hilltop I spotted the tip of what looked like
J1's
big fin really close to the Whidbey side, heading north (though the other whales had been seen going south - I think J1 was just chasing a fish in close to shore). I found one group of whales nearing Point No Point at
11:10 am, with another group following them, including at least 2 males. The whales were closer to the peninsula side, very spread out, traveling south-east. I went further south & found the whales again from Scatchet Head at
12:15 pm, south Whidbey as they traveled between Pt. No Point & Apple Cove Pt. By
1:30 pm, the leaders were heading south, between Apple Cove Pt. & Edmonds, with more coming in, traveling close to the Peninsula side. At around 2 pm, Fred Felleman & Center for Whale Research Staff who were out with the whales, reported they had sighted some of the whales heading over toward Possession Bank & Possession Sound. They also confirmed seeing whales from all three pods - J, K & L. I went over to the SE tip of the island to see if I could find them, but found no whales in Possession Sound, so went back over to Scatchet Head, to find the whales in the same place I had seen them an hour before! At
2:45 pm the whales were just north of the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes, between Apple Cove Pt. & Edmonds, heading east, some coming from the south headed north. By
3:30 pm when I left them, they were between Possession Pt. & Edmonds, milling & fishing, no real direction of travel.

Awoke this morning to a
grey
whale spouting and feeding at

7:15 AM
very close to the green buoy at the entrance to Penn Cove, visible from my bedroom on Snakelum Point. He spent a good 15 minutes there but then submerged with no further sighings.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at

9:30 am
to report watching a pod of
orcas
heading south from the Port Townsend/Keystone ferry. He wasn't sure yet which pod it is - I'm heading out to see if I can find them & get some photos & ID's.

Spotted a dozen or so
orcas
heading south (

8:40am
) out from Lagoon Pt. in front of Marrowstone Island.
