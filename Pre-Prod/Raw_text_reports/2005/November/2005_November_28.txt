Orca Sightings for November 28, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about
1pm
while motoring north 3/4 mile south of Point No Point I suddenly found my boat surrounded by
Orcas
. I shut down the engine and depth sounder and drifted as there was only a slight breeze from the southeast. I counted 8-ten on the surface at a time. They were very active so it was hard to say how many were really there but I would guess many more than that. They were spread across about a half square mile and seemed to be playing and feeding. I saw two babies one very small 6-8 ft and one 10ft or so and many 12ft or so and probably 4 that were very large one with a dorsal that leaned over while on the surface. Some whales had a gray marking just aft of the dorsal.
