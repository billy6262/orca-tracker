Orca Sightings for November 6, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
0830
I heard lots of southern resident
orca
calls on Val's hydrophone system, and soon after a large group of whales with many adult males came porpoising south in mid-Haro Strait. Dave and Kelley went out to identify them, and as of 1300 they have seen members of J, K, and L12-s spread out in mid Strait of Juan de Fuca south of Trial Island, heading west. We do not know yet if all individuals of all three pods are present.
