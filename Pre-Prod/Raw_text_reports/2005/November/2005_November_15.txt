The Center for Whale Research caught up with the [
orcas
] in the glare of the afternoon sun, & identified J pod as they headed north at

4:30 pm
between Double Bluff (west Whidbey) & Point No Point (Kitsap Peninsula).
*
John Herman called to report that 4
orcas
came into view near Useless Bay, west Whidbey Island at

4:20 pm
, heading north.
*
Jack Rawls of Maple Pt, Clinton (SW Whidbey) called to report a pod of
orcas
heading west at

3:20 pm
. He saw at least 8 orcas, including 1 adult male & 1 calf. They were swimming rapidly, with some playing & feeding behaviors observed.
*
I was finally able to get out to the SW side of Whidbey to look for the
orcas
that were reported heading north. I found them just NE of Apple Cove Pt. & Kintston, heading NW at

2:15 pm
. They were very spread out (more details from Kurt who saw them earlier in the day included they were spread out over several miles while heading north past Bainbridge Island as well), closer to the Kitsap Peninsula side. I observed one male that looked like J1, & was able to take a few photos when the whales weren't directly in the glare of the afternoon sun. I watched until
3:30 pm as they continued NW toward Point No Point & Admiralty Inlet.

orcas
] between Bainbridge and Shilshole, heading north at 3-6 kts.
