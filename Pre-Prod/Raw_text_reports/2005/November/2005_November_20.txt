Minke
whale & an Elephant Seal off Point No Point (Kitsap Peninsula, WA) this
afternoon

The
gray
whales have continued to feed between Shipwreck Point and the mouth of the Sekiu River. We are close to seven miles west of Sekiu. Over the last several days, anywhere from two - six gray whales have been sighted during daylight. One of the sprays is quite small, and one is very large and powerful.
