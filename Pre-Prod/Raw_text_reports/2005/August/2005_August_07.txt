Orca Sightings for August 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
About 14 whales came by Thieves Bay on Pender Island. Apparently there was a superpod coming up from the south but they split at Moresby Island and half of them went down to south Pender Island. The whales came very close to the shore, about 15 or 20 feet away. One large one had kelp hanging off his dorsal fin.
