Orca Sightings for August 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jan Nicholson called in a report of a small
gray
whale off Onamac Pt, NW Camano Island, at

12:30 pm
. They watched it for about 20 minutes, as it headed NW toward Coupeville, Whidbey Island.
*
In False Bay
orcas
were foraging, and there were many family groups spread out. A few more breaches and the whales began to spread out with some whales near shore, and others over 1 mile off-shore. It appeared to be J's & K's.
