south of Grays Harbor, 10 miles offshore 46 48N 124 26W heading south.

We headed down San Juan Channel, and about halfway down spotted a young
minke
whale foraging! A few times he appeared to actually follow us as he made a steady course towards Goose Island. At Cattle Pass---
Orcas
! It appeared to be part of
L-Pod
, and they were actively fishing near the Salmon Bank marker.
