Orca Sightings for August 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's & K's
up North,
part of L's
at Lime Kiln, and part of L's at Boundary Pass. Well, during the night the Northern L's came down San Juan Channel and joined up with their family for a moonlit frolic around Eagle Point.

J pod
passed by Beddes rocks on the north west side of North Pender Island at

12:30 pm
. It may be that J pod is swimming with another pod as there seemed to be more whales than normal for J pod. A few whales were breaching and tail slapping.

All three pods
passing by Low Island (San Juan County Park). Later the fog lifted and whales scattered in both directions--J's & K's going to Active Pass, while L's were in Boundary Pass and at Lime Kiln. The whales were facing South-bound, but the strong tide was pushing them North. It appeared at times as if they were swimming backwards.
