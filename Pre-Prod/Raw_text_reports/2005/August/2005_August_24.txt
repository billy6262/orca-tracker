Orca Sightings for August 24, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mich-mash of
transients
inbound from Sooke at
2pm
in 3 distinct groups, T44 and T21 amongst the ones I am qualified to ID, the others I'll leave to the experts to send ID's in. Incredible that they were all within half a mile from 2 humpbacks, 2 miles off Beechey Head. Our evening trip found T44, 2 females and a calf close to shore at William Head, NE bound along the shore. We picked them up at the end of the trip (
20:00) slightly NW of Macaulay Point, Victoria, hugging the shore giving waterside residents a great show. We watched amazed as they rounded the point and wandered into Victoria Harbour. They frolicked in the same place for 40mins, parellel with the Navy fuel docks and behind the Crystal Harmony Cruise ship in the middle of the harbour. The calf spun round playfully in a pile of kelp, and treated us to 2 spyhops and what can only be described as a head stand. The calfs tail and entire tail stock to its body came out of the water, and stood there for 5 seconds!
