We were out at Hein Bank around

11:00 am
with at least
K's and L's
, I think it was a superpod but the whales were extremely spread out over a few miles. They seemed to be foraging and were very active at the surface, lots of breaches, spy hops and tail slaps.

Can anyone say
SUPERPOD
? J's & K's came down Rosario in the fog this morning, and joined up around

11:00 AM
several miles off-shore. The vocalizations were incredible! Then later in the day, we caught up to the whales about 10-11 miles South of Cattle Point (towards Port Townsend/Admiralty Inlet area). And let me say now--Superpods are awesome! You'd see one large group off snoozing, while another group would be actively fishing or playing, and the vocalizations were so astounding! We saw several "sea snakes", and some interesting interactions between L41 (Mega) and J27 Blackberry.
