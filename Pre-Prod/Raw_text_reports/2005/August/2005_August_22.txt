Orca Sightings for August 22, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient
orcas T44, two female T46's and a calf close in to the beach north west of Cadboro Point (on Chart 3462 where the cable ends). Expecting their usual silent discreet behaviour, we saw a porpoise (not sure which) spinning through the air, and they all went down, had a feast for a minute, and then the calf and a female started 4 breaches each!

½ mile off Mud Bay, we heard the familiar sound of whales grabbing air. We eased the sails and soon found ourselves surrounded by 10-20, some playing in the kelp.
