Orca Sightings for August 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our morning trip located
J & K pods
between the Fraser River and the coal docks. The whales were very spread out, with some in close to the sand bars and others way off shore. Our afternoon trip caught up to J & K pods slowly making their way south past Tumbo Island, then around East Point. When the Orcas entered Boundary Pass, they spread out alot, and brought on the vocals.
