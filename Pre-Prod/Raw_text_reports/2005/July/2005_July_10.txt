============================================================

Entry 1:
Bob Anderson called to report 2
orcas
- 1 extremely large male & one female - off Westport.

Kathy Cole called Judy Dicksion about
10.30 am
saying the
orcas
were off the Dosewallips delta and then moved north she believed but they were at some distance so could not provide details on behavior.
*
Spotted the Hood Canal
transients
Near the Duckabush delta heading north, there was a kill with the usual gull attendants, then the celebratory playing, then they set off again past Pleasant Harbor toward Quilcene. The sighting started around

7:40 pm
and continued for about 45 minutes. They then disappeared and left the observation boat going back and forth trying to locate them.

, we watched a pod of
Orcas
moving toward west side San Juan Island from the direction of Discovery Island. There were several spy hops and we saw at least two large males and one young'un. Around

4:30 - we saw a similar group milling around Pile Point, with lots of splashing.

Out of Westport WA, there is a green marker # "3" out in the ocean at the entrance of the harbor (the marker "GH" is the other marker that indicates the entrance to Grays Harbor), at
1015
hours, I was heading exactly due west from "3" in 150' of water (about 2 to 3 kmiles into the ocean away from "3" but use the depth for locating where i was just go due west from "3" until you are 150' of water), we saw heading due south an entire pod of orcas. The best count we could confirm (3 guys counting EXPOSED fins to themselves) was 14 orcas (meaning 3 guys saw 14 exposed fins at the same instant in time) in the main body of orcas but, there was more under the water. Also, we were pretty sure there were 3 orcas trailing the main group. At the front right of the pack there was what we thought were 3 males with largest of them in front & to the right of all of them. He was BIG. We called him the leader of the pack. There were 2 (we think males) because they were big but slightly smaller than what we called the leader of the pack. They were obviously running right with the leader and just behind & echelon left of the leader. Farther over to the left and farther back behind the males (say several hundred yards) there were at least 5 and as much as 7 female orcas running along in their own little group and as best we could tell each one of females had a baby running with her, the babies were anywhere from 12' or so to 15, 16, 17 feet or so, (hard to tell but, definitely babies as they stayed right by their moms).... so, you had 3 males leading the way due south with the biggest (and he was BIG) in front with his 2 buddies, with the school of 5-7 moms & 5-7 babies running together just back & behind the males, so the main pod had between 14 & 18 orcas in it for sure.

We spent the day with
J Pod
again. Right now they are at False Bay, milling in the flood tide.

J-Pod
was near Trial Island, just resting. As we rounded Cattle Point, they began moving towards False Bay, arriving just minutes after we did. Finally got to see little J-41 about 200 yards from the boat. On the drive home along the west side, the J's were still south of Pile Point, just north of False Bay.
