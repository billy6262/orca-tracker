Orca Sightings for July 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brian McLaughlin, Fish Biologist at the Pt. Whitney Lab called Judy Dicksion that his boss was certain he saw the
transients
in Quilcene Bay about
4.30 pm
.

Forwarded from Chris Dunagan, Environmental Reporter, Kitsap Sun - At Guillemot Cove, Hood Canal at about

1:00pm
, 4
orcas
swam past us heading North, very close to shore. Very exciting for our campers, this sighting was surely the highlight of our day.

A large group of
transients
were headed north from Campbell River, BC. T20/21 were identified but they were travelling separately from the other 12-14. By the way, there are two new "A" babies; one born to A62 and the other to A50 (Northern Resident orcas).

Once again we headed out towards False Bay where we hoped to see
J-Pod
. The whales were spread out over an area of probably close to 4 miles, some inshore, some over a mile off shore. Just as we thought the whales were gone from our area, up pop 3 orcas. J-17 (Princess Angeline), J-28 (Polaris), and J-35 (Tahlequah) were going back and forth in a foraging mode, and as they neared the boat let out several very loud vocalizations! One passenger thought they saw a fish in the mouth of J-17, but I was looking elsewhere and missed it. We also got a brief, distant view of J-19 and her new calf J-41.
