Orca Sightings for July 11, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
Slippery Six
were just northeast of Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab hanging around the bouy in center channel for the Torpedo Range at approx
1.00 pm
. Mark Millard from the Lab said they were breaching and porpoising over the waves making discernible "bow waves".

About 1 mile south of Lime Kiln and about 3/4 mile off shore, we saw a small group of
orcas
approaching our boat. The whales stayed on the west side again all day.

Yesterday we were out with
J-pod
off the west side of San Juan when the NOAA R/V Noctiluca (Dawn Noren, Jennifer Marsh and co.) spotted several whales chasing another harbor porpoise. We went over and found the three whales (J11, J27 and J39), but they had finished that interaction, with an unknown outcome. A few minutes after we started following them they began chasing another harbor porpoise, which appeared to be trying to evade them at high speed. This time we were able to confirm that the porpoise was killed; after a long dive they came up with the dead porpoise and nudged it around for a while, then the three whales left the porpoise floating at the surface. We picked up the porpoise (a ~1-year old female) and Joe Gaydos performed a necropsy on it yesterday afternoon. No tooth rakes, broken bones or obvious contusions. Exact cause of death will have to await the results from the histopathology, but the porpoise appeared to have drowned. We may have some good photos of the interaction that we'll try to put on the web site in a couple of days.

J pod
was in its west side shuffle mode again today. Saw great stuff off Hannah Heights. At around

1:30 p.m
. J14 and offspring engaged in what looked like teaching J40 how to push a fish around. First J14 dove into an eddy with J37 and J40 circling above. J14 came up with a fish which she pushed towards J40 several times. J40 then began pushing the fish. J37 then appeared to start helping mom teach J40. Soon J30 also joined in pushing the fish towards J40. Very interesting! This evening J pod headed south, spread far and wide.

We spent some time with
J's
off of Lime Kiln. They were milling about, fishing and drifting with the tide. According to the Glacier, they had been up north of Spieden earlier in the day.
