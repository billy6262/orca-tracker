Orca Sightings for July 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Josh London called to report they had reports of the Hood Canal
Transients
in the late morning between the bridge & Lofall. At

12:30
he called back to say they had found them just south of South Pt, on the west side headed south.
*
J pod.
The morning trip found the whales travelling very slowly Northbound approaching Stuart Island, split into two main groups. We sighted the new calf amongst the group of adult females. On the afternoon trip, we met up with
J pod
again in Strait of Georgia, just east of Active Pass. Quiet travel time was apparently over, and it was time for the show. Lots of breaches, lobtailling, pec slaps, cartwheels, backstroke and general rowdy behavior. And the vocals! Sounded like the pod was celebrating their new arrival. As in the morning, J1, J2 and J28 were travelling a little to the outside of the rest of the group, with several females clustered around the new calf. When we left the J's around 4 pm, they appeared to be travelling south towards the Roberts Bank Coal terminal, on the eastern side of the Strait of Georgia. They did not have this calf yet on Wednesday afternoon at 5 pm when we left J pd going south past Lummi Island.
