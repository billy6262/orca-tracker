Orca Sightings for July 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were just east of Neah Bay at

7:30 pm
when a pod of either 4 or 5 [orcas] swam past us toward the ocean. They went straight past fast with none of them stopping. We have one picture that shows the tail fins of two of them if you are interested.

At
0855
Shanti (Nordic Tug 26) was eastbound across Rosario Straight. When about 1 mile south of Reef Point (Cypress Island) we observed
orcas
on a reciprocal course at about 1/4 mile dead ahead, so stopped the boat and shut down the engine. Unfortunately I had the telephoto lens on and the westbound pod passed too close for good results, some passing under the boat. I estimate number at >1 dozen, perhaps as many as 2 dozen. Speed estimated at 10 - 15 knots.

we've had several reports/rumors of a new calf, but it has yet to be observed or confirmed by the Center for Whale Research - will let you know when/if that happens! If anyone gets any good photos of calf & Mom, please let us know
) Js last seen off of South Beach, at
1900
