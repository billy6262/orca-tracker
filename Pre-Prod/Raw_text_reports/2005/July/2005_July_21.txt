Orca Sightings for July 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
10.50
today we encountered a small group of
L pod
whales, which Osprey had already been with since 10.35,
interacting with a harbor porpoise neonate
. The female porpoise still had fetal folds and a flopped dorsal fin and was probably only a day or so old. The interactions included carrying the porpoise in the mouth, on the rostrum, on the belly and on the back. The porpoise made several attempts to move away from the whales, but was rounded up each time. The last whale (L5) left the porpoise at 12.30, who was in pretty bad shape by then. She had several tooth rakes and appeared to be exhausted and eventually died about an 1 1/2 hour later.

A day of mixed pods of whales,
J's & L's
. As we came from Salmon Bank, we could see whale blows spread out over 4-6 miles, with small groups of 2-5 whales traveling in various directions. Several groups had boats around them, while others milled about boat-less. The small group near us seemed to be a nursery group with one adult female tending to 2-3 youngsters. And like human youngsters, these guys were in the mood to play! They would breach, roll over on top of each other, and do tons of spy hops! And for the first time, I saw these guys do a new thing (which to me is always exciting)--when they spy-hopped, they tended to have their mouths wide open! They even took a couple of turns riding on each others backs. It was, in the words of our female passengers "soooo cuuute".
