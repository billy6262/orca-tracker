Orca Sightings for July 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Judy & Don Dicksion reported 6
orcas
off False Bay,

5:30 - 6 pm
, seemed to be heading generally west. 1 adult male was with the group, no other whales or any boats around. They were in Don's plane scouting the area for the Slippery Six, but even though this was a pod of 6 she was pretty sure it wasn't her gals~
