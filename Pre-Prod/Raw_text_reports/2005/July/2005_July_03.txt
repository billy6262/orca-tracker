Orca Sightings for July 3, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out with family on Hood Canal this weekend staying . We saw the following from shore: A pod of 4 (?) swimming north around late morning. They porpoised/breached a few times but mostly just made a beeline north. In the same hour I saw spouts directly east of the Ayock Beach point about 2/3rds of the way across the Canal.

HJ Murray Marine Park, around

5:15-
5:45 PM
, middle of Dabob Bay. Whales moving north into Dabob Bay very quickly, barely surfacing, then going down for the longest I've ever seen.

We saw the
Slippery Six
today about
4 p.m
. We first spotted them near the entrance to Pleasant Harbor and watched them move north into Dabob Bay. They were surfacing and breathing - no other behaviors were noted.

It was about

12:15 pm
today
July 3rd that I spotted the
Slippery Six
in the middle of the canal. They were just about to the mouth of Dewatto Bay in the middle. One was ahead of the other 5 heading north. In just a few minutes though all six were together in a straight line from east to west going north. They looked like they were in just a travel mode.
