Orca Sightings for July 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Paul at the Lab said the
Six
were seen at about
1.00 pm
again but were just east of the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab, maybe 3/4 of the way across the channel to the east along the Toandos Peninsula shoreline, and traveling south. I heard from several people the orcas had been very active for the last few days around the Duckabush, Dose and up in northwest Dabob Bay area.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at

4:43 pm
to report
J pod
off Lime Kiln Lighthouse, west San Juan Island, & a
humpback
whale off Kellett Bluff heading north. Ctr. for Whale Research Staff were onboard, so they were heading up to get ID shots of the humbpack.
*
We saw the
Gray
over off South East Lopez where it has been feeding for the past several weeks. Then at about

4:00
we met up with
J pod
in that sleepy traveling mode with Ruffles acting as lead in Mid channel Haro Strait off East Victoria. At the bouy two-three miles north of Protection Island we sighted a
Minke
who surfaced about three times before we lost it.

There is a
Grey
Whale hanging around Cape Saint Mary and the Lopez Pass Area off Lopez Island. We think it is a mother and calf. She's been there for about 3 weeks. We hope she is alright. She seems very active.
Thanks, Alice Campbell
