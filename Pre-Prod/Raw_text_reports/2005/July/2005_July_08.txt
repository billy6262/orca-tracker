Orca Sightings for July 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod
has apparently taken up temporary residence on the West side of San Juan near False Bay, and as has been their pattern of late, they were very spread out and slowly milling in a Northerly direction. J26 & friends worked the tide rips quite actively, one time slowly perusing the boat as they swam by. We observed J19 and J41 off in the distance near Balcomb Reef.
