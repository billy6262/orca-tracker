L12's
spending the entire
morning and afternoon
between Pile Point and Eagle Point. Later that evening I received a call that
J Pod and the rest of L-Pod
were inbound for Pile Point. Alas, once the two pods joined up, they then headed back west and were traveling past Discovery when we were at Lime Kiln.
