Orca Sightings for July 30, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas
were finally sighted out in the Strait of Georgia, southbound towards East Point, Saturna Island. They were located because we could see entire whales out of the water on the horizon ... repeatedly. This was probably my best day on the water this year. As the whales approached East Point and Boiling Reef, they slowed a bit to play in the kelp beds, do a little foraging, and alot of splashing around. L73 (Flash) was doing his best to attract the attention of some J Pod ladies. By afternoon the whales were spread out over miles in Haro Strait off San Juan Island, shuffling North and South and very relaxed. We had a great view of J1 and L57 (Ruffles and Faith) swimming along side by side until L57 porpoised off ahead.
