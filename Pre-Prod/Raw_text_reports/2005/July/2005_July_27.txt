Orca Sightings for July 27, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on the Sound Watch boat following
K-31 all day
. As we traveled south from false bay off shore a few miles we started the video camera. I stayed focused on K-31 for about 45 minutes. The K pod was getting closer and closer and finally K-31 made a sharp turn toward them and a few Ks broke away from the group and "B-lined" towards him. They submerged together and 7 minutes later re-surfaced with a lot of breaths and close mingling. Then there was a classic "greeting ceremony" 2 lines approx 20 whales each, facing each other (Ks facing Ls?), approach, submerge, resurface and high energy "mingling". The surface vocalizations were quite loud. some were even caught by the video camera even though we were some distance away. Kari has the camera with SW. It was a very sweet few minutes, we got a little choked up. Sigh..... :-)

The mystery whale photographed by Darcie's husband off Turn Island on 24 July appears on close examination of the saddle and spine pattern to be the same whale seen on 26 July by Island Explorer II, and subsequently identified by us as
K31
(a six year old male). It is very odd that this whale was wandering on its own, and even more odd that it did not associate with other southern residents, even though I saw it swim right past L12's off False Bay. Usually it was quiet, but off Bellevue Point, San Juan Island, it made several loud and distinct K pod calls in late afternoon. By the evening of 26 July it headed back south in Haro Strait, by itself. This morning, 27 July,
K pod
did show up, and K31 reunited with them. All is well.

J & most of L pod
were up North again this morning. They were located just south of the bluffs at Point Roberts, heading North & very spread out. There was lots of action from the whales, with porpoising, breaching and spyhops. Ruffles and Faith were offshore quite a ways on their own - as if they were having a guys meeting.
