Orca Sightings for July 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
An extremely interesting observation today while out collecting fecal samples and prey remains from J-pod. We were watching J16, J26 and J36 heading towards Turn Point in Boundary Pass, when Adam U spotted two harbour porpoise a couple hundred meters in front of the whales. Shortly after we saw a high-speed surfacing typically associated with a fish-chase, and the three whales were chasing a single harbour porpoise (not sure what happened to the second one). The porpoise was obviously trying to evade the whales but with no luck. J16 surfaced underneath the porpoise at high speed and lifted it into the air, and one of the whales lifted it into the air at high speed on a second occasion a couple seconds later. The high speed chase lasted for a couple minutes and all animals disappeared on a long dive. When the three whales surfaced a few minutes later there were no signs of the porpoise. As part of our predation study we do try to watch the mouthlines of the whales to see if they are carrying anything, and follow in fluke prints to pick up discarded bits of food, but neither suggested that the whales had anything in their mouths. Unfortunately there were no further signs of the porpoise, so we could not confirm if it was killed, though from watching a large number of transient kills of marine mammals over the years it sure looked the same. Greg Schorr did obtain some very good photos, which we will put on the Cascadia web site in a couple of days when we get back to Olympia.

...as we crossed Boundary Pass -
J Pod
was extremely spread out, with J-19 and new calf J-41 sighted by our other naturalist near the shoreline of Saturna Island. But as we floated in the nice, calm waters we had a nice sighting of J-27 Blackberry and a few others (couldn't see their saddlepatches). Later in the day as we prepared to leave, we were lucky enough to get a visit from J-22 (Oreo), J34 (Doublestuff), J38 (Cookie) and another youngster that we thought was most likely J39 (Mako). Then as we neared Skipjack, we crossed paths with none other than J-1 (Ruffles), who again demonstrated the dimorphic traits of adult males versus females.
