Orca Sightings for June 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hood Canal
Transients @
7:15 PM
, very close on the west side (could hear them breathing), just off Duryea Point, just north of Dewato Bay. They then moved slightly northeast, breeched a couple of times due west of Liliwaup, then circled and tossed a seal, and another unidentified animal. Everything happened within 20 minutes. They headed north toward Ayock Point.
