Orca Sightings for June 28, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We caught the
gray
whale still feeding just south of Lopez Pass around
1030
. Then we saw
L Pod
on the south end of Hein Bank just milling around. At
1230
we spotted the
humpback
that was hanging out, presumably feeding at the north end of Hein Bank. It was taking very long dives, but we did see it do a cartwheel. Then on the way home we spotted a
minke
on McArthur Bank at
1330
.

L-pod
, two
humpbacks
and one
grey
on Hein Bank. I did't see the Humpbacks but the captain and one visitor saw one spy hop and it was a pretty good id. Transiting several harbor porpoises.

J's & L12's
were spotted several miles offshore of San Juan Island. Whales were spread out over several miles, with small groups here and there. J26 Mike did a wonderful tailslap display by doing almost a dozen in a row! Shortly after that we saw another whale pop up from under him, so we weren't sure what was going on there. Here's the latest from The RUMOR MILL: We heard from a boat, who heard from a boat that heard from another boat (you get the idea) that there is yet ANOTHER L-POD baby!
