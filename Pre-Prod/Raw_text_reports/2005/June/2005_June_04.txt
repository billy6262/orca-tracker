Orca Sightings for June 4, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
K7
found and photo id taken. Today L57 was missing but all of
Lpod
did not appear to be there. Another young one L88 "Wave walker" is a real growing boy.

All 6 HC
Transients
spotted just West of Misery Point traveling NE at about

7:45 PM
.
Bill Juneau
Seabeck

HCT
passed by Maple Beach in travel mode at

7:30 pm
headed North. They did make one stop and were milling around for a few minutes but decided that whatever it was, was not worth sticking around for and continued at a fast pace heading north towards Oak Head, Toanados Peninsula.

After crossing over Salmon Bank headed west, we approached the distant blows cautiously about

6:30 pm
, slowing to near idle speed and moving away from shore. About a mile outside of False Bay there were
orcas
all around us, but all of them too distant to make any IDs. Suddenly a whale breached 200 yards away, followed by a taillob, then one pivoted on its rostrum in a full cartwheel, then a juvenile rose in a high spyhop, belly side towards us, where the its best stereoscopic vision faced directly at us. A few came toward us, one flying by the boat a few feet under the surface, upside down, as if to inspect us. They were spread a mile or two apart without much consistent direction except that gradually the whole disorganized blob of whales moved due south toward Dungeness Spit. There seemed to be a lot of foraging, with occasional breaches and lobtails raising white splashes further and further away.

I know there has been talk of K7 not returning this year. She has a pretty distinctive dorsal fin, though, and I'm pretty sure I saw K7 in front of Lime Kiln today at about

3:30
when
K-Pod
and the
L12s
were here.

We caught up to mostly
Lpod
at Hein Bank with help from the Victoria whale watch boats at

11:00 am
. About a dozen animals traveled north to San Juan island in tight groups and stayed down for extended periods; one calf consistently gave away their location by surfacing to breathe often! Saw
K40
and
L22
(ID via digital photo) and several males. Later we paused enroute to Everett to watch
Jpod
going north in a hurry past Iceberg Point at 4 pm.

Howard just called in a report from the Passport to Puget Sound Cruise taking place tonight - they are way out off False Bay in Haro Strait,

7:30 pm
and are seeing
orcas
spread out all around them, breaching, tail-waving.

Approx

12:45 pm -
1:00 pm
I spotted the
Slippery Six
just North of Potlatch, about 1/4 of the way in the canal off the east bank. Then again at
1:30 pm -
1:40 pm they were just north Dewatto, breaching, spy hopping, rolling and just having a good old time. Again about 1/4 of the way in the canal off the east bank. Then starting moving closer and closer to the shore line, making diving movements in a circle formation. If I didn't know better I would swear they were on the beach. This continued for about 10 minutes. They then started heading north again in a single file with their dorsal fin just breaking the surface.

We observed the Hood Canal
Transients
around

8:45 am
. They were traveling south. We initially noticed them splashing a lot off of Lilliwaup then they began traveling south past the Glen Ayre resort. Our final observation was them off of the Finch Creek Hatchery at Hoodsport. We observed the orcas again at around Noon, this time heading north, closer to the eastern Shoreline. Lots of surface play in one area for about 30 minutes just south of Cougar Spit, then they continued with regular travel north.

Kathy Danworth of MAKINPICZ called me and said the
Slippery Six
were passing the front of the Holiday Beach area at
8.30 am
. They were pretty playful Kathy said, with some breaching etc. yet moving towards Hoodsport.
