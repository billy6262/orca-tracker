Orca Sightings for June 22, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
10 am
we observed a pod of
orcas
heading past False Bay headed south. These were later ID'd by the Center for Whale Research as the L12's, with K21 & K40.

L pod
on their way to Victoria in the
am
trip and then on the
afternoon
trip we caught up with them again nearing Race Rocks and booking for the Pacific. The morning trip was also a treat as we had a
minke
whale near Hein, Dalls and the day started with a nice visit from a very friendly
grey
whale around Shoal Bight (sp?) off of Lopez.

Elaine Wiley of Ayok Pt. reported the Hood Canal
Transients
mid-channel at Ayok Pt at

8:20 pm
, headed north in a tight pod.
*
Paul Shaumberg of Great Bend Charters in Union reported seeing 2 of the adult female Hood Canal
Transients
at
3 pm
off Potlatch, on the Kitsap side, while two of the calves were off by themselves further south, near a lone seal......maybe learning to hunt on their own? The HC Transients had also been seen at
10 am
at Hamma Hamma heading south.
