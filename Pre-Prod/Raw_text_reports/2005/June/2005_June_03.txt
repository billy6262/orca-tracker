Brian McLaughlin, and his crew from the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab called to say they had seen a few blows of the
transients
in the area. About 10 mins later George called again and said the orcas were interested in a geoduck harvester boat (which was stationary) and the Six in fact had surrounded it! The crew could see blows on each side and then a good-sized harbor seal had jumped up on the dive steps and actually got behind it. Apparently the boat crew tried to dislodge the seal but couldn't. They said the orcas appeared to be traveling north after the boat.

Well, with the return of
K-Pod
yesterday, we thought now if only L's would show up. We heard that the
L12's
did indeed come back in and were between False Bay and Open Bay (San Juan Island) most of the day. We were coming down the back of Henry when J-Pod decided to go back North, so we were happy to wait for them. And Ruffles, that 54 year-old rascal did a beautiful spy hop, followed by not one but TWO breaches! We also noticed that J-8 Speiden appears to have a new nick at the base of her dorsal fin. The whales were very active until they passed Kellett Bluff, then they settled back down into travel mode.

. A boat out harvesting Goeduck had been surrounded by the whales, & a seal jumped on the swim step of the boat & they were trying to get the seal off, to no avail......
