We caught up with
J pod
off the northern end of Alden Bank around 1830 and followed along with them headed south.
K Pod
became mixed in around the south end of the bank. We spotted Cappucino and Raggedy for sure. Cappucino breached twice nearby. They were all also fairly vocal which was a nice treat.

There were
Orcas
out front my house in the
afternoon
. I live on French Beach, (which is just past Sheringham Point, 20 minutes outside of Sooke BC) and noticed five zodiacs and a covered boat or two observing a group heading out toward Port Renfrew. I'm not sure who the group was, I was hoping to find out if it was J, K, L's or maybe even some Transients using the report at the end of the day but it seems no one commented on them in this area.....

sounds like it was likely L pod - see report below - sb)

2
Humpbacks
, 3 miles south of Beechey Bay at

11:50
. Non directional behaviour from what we saw.
L's
all day off the south end of Vancouver Island, west bound, fighting the flood tide! Saw Mega (L41) up close and personal. Huge push for all the boats to head out that direction, L's very spread out all day, and offshore. last call was from Point No Point, west bound,
5pm
.

I usually don't write in a redundant and late sighting report, but the behavior I watched
J pod
perform was awesome yesterday. We had J pod just southeast of Point Roberts, traveling south in their family groups at about 3 knots. Then all of the pod grouped up and slowed to a crawl. All of a sudden at least 15 whales breached, multiple times, at the same time for about five minutes! They were breaching and tail slapping but no spyhops. Then they spread out in a line and started moving south at a quicker pace with an occasional breach. Looked to me that they were organizing to begin foraging. This had to be the best I have ever seen in 15 years. It's always really nice to see J-1 (Ruffles) and J-2 (Granny) put on an aerial display. I heard K pod was a couple of miles behind the J's but couldn't confirm that.
