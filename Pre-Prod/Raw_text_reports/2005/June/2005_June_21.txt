Orca Sightings for June 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
9 am
we observed a pod of orcas (
K pod
) heading south past False Bay. From

9:30 - 10 am we watched the pod from American Camp - they turned & were headed north. At
12:30 pm they again passed False Bay heading north. From
4 - 6 pm
we were out with Tom McMillen with
K pod
between Lime Kiln & Hannah Heights, west side of San Juan Island. At around
5:15 pm, about a mile off Hannah Heights, 19-year-old male K21 (Cappucino) came toward us and breached twice within a hundred yards. He's nearly fully sprouted now and is a very big boy. Soon he came up from behind us to about 30 feet away. At that point, his sister and only sibling, K40 (Raggedy) just over 40 years old, suddenly turned and bee-lined directly at K21's head, as if they were going to butt heads. The water frothed and it was impossible to see what happened, but immediately K40 turned around and streaked away from K21 with a large salmon between her teeth. It's only speculation to assume that K21 gave K40 the fish. Their mother, K18 (Kiska) died about a year and a half ago.

What I think was
K pod
going south off the west side (San Juan Island) at
7 am
. Caught them again going south off the west side in the middle of a storm and rough seas at about
5 pm
. Many breaches, tail lobs, cartwheels and porpoising leaps. At around
6 pm
as the water was calming, I was watching who I think was K21 Cappucino and K40 Raggedy forage with a mom and calf about 1/2 mile off the Pile Point/Hannah Heights area. Suddenly a huge
minke
whale did 7 full breaches within several hundred yards of the orcas. Each time it went straight up with its full body out of the water, turned, and then slammed down. It was definitely a minke, since I could see the white stripes on its pecs, the white belly, and even the throat pleats. I did not notice any change in the orcas' behavior--even the calf kept leaping and porpoising without any noticeable change. When the minke was done breaching it swam rapidly towards K21. The last I saw it, it dove within what, from my perspective, looked like about 50 yards from K21. I saw K21 again, but was not able to see the minke. As I was leaving, I saw several other orcas change direction and head towards the area where K21 was foraging.

Watched the Hood Canal
Transients
mosey around Maple Beach at a slow pace heading north today. They were milling around a bit but for the most part were underwater for long periods of time. I spotted them around

4:30pm
south of Scenic Beach Park in mid channel heading north. Lost sight of them heading around oak head towards Bangor around
5:15pm.
