Orca Sightings for June 10, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nancy at the Old Oyster Farm at Beacon Point said that the Slippery Six (HC
Transients
) gave a terrific "performance" right in their area around the
7.00 pm
. Nancy said they stayed quite a while and were very playful with breaches, tail slaps and spy-hops for about on hour before moving south.

We saw large numbers of
orcas
in the
evening
, as many as 10-12 from our viewing site at the Westside Preserve overlooking Haro Strait. The group was traveling north and came into view about

7:00 pm
. They swam around in the area immediately in front of us doing lots of tail slapping and pectoral fin flapping, a couple of spyhops and one spectacular full breach over the course of about 30 minutes in the area. There were so many spread out over the vista that it was difficult to know which way to look. They were close enough to shore that we easily could hear their blowing. They left heading south again. The group included a range of sizes including what appeared to be large males.

We watched a single
transient
in the morning (

10:30
) off 10-mile point until it reached Trial Island. Then a
humpback
whale appeared off the northwest end of Discovery Island and we followed it into the middle of Haro Strait (
12:00). A report of 6 transients showed up about 3 miles off the northeast side of Discovery Island and we monitored the few boats with the whales (T20 and T21 group) until the end of the day. We watched them hunting and acquired a lung sample from one of their kills.

A report of the Hood canal
Transients
from Tom Berry at
7 pm
- all six were off Beacon Pt, 3 miles north of Eldon, heading south toward Hama Hama real slowly.

K's & J's
heading from Blundeon Island towards Turn Point! As the whales crossed Boundary Pass, they began to vocalize loudly! Cappucino (K-21) even did a big breach behind the boat, sending a big splash into the air! Later at Turn Point, the K's went down Haro Strait while J's decided to head back north. We heard reports of
transients
heading up Haro Strait and even a
humpback
at Kellett Bluff.
