The HC
transients
between

3:30 and
4:00
, in the far southeastern area of hood canal (approximately between Sunset Beach and Forest Beach). They were moving slowly, first northward but slowly turning and eventually heading south again, toward Union. Caught sight of them again headed south toward Union (at about
4:00). By that time they were moving quickly, silently, and in a much more obvious direction.

orcas
in the distance from Washington Park, SW of Anacortes, from

2:10 pm
. They were first heading SW, then turned & headed NW.
*

1:15 p.m.
I just sighted the
HC Orcas
between Potlatch State Park and the Point across the canal from the park. They were last seem mid-channel between Potlatch St. Park and Tahuya. It appears they made a kill here as they were doing there after kill play routine. Also there were several seagulls overhead. By the time I got around to Union they had switched from their feeding routine to their travel mood. They were staying under for up to fifteen minutes. I followed them to Twanoh St. Park. Here they went into their hunting activity from
2:30 to
3:05. They didn't kill anything as there were no seagulls or after kill play. Then they continued toward Belfair.

Recvd these msgs on the Hood Canal
Transients
the Slippery Six: Hannah from Kayak Rental, Union, had a report of the "girls" on the W. Shore of the Kitsap Penin at Dewatto heading south towards Hoodsport at
10.45 am
. Later Hannah reported she could see the Six make a possible kill in Annas Bay (south of the Great Bend) about 12.50 pm, and then some possible "after kill" behavior of tail slaps and breaching etc. Cindy Sund, with her Hood Canal Charters boat on the water at
1:10 pm, watched the transients hunting in Annas Bay for about 15-20 min then slowly moving east towards Twanoh State Park, Hwy 106.
