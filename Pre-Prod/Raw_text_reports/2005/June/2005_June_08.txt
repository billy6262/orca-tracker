Orca Sightings for June 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spent some time with
J's and K's
at the south end of Rosario between

10:30 and
1:00
today. K's were somewhat vocally active, but the J's kept pretty quiet. When we left them they had circled around Lopez past Cattle Pass, presumably to meet up with L pod in Haro (we left before then). We saw some great fishing action, which in one case may have been a lesson for a younger orca.
