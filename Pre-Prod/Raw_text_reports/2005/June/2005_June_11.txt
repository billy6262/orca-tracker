Orca Sightings for June 11, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from someone at Ray's Grocery in Seiku, reporting 4 orcas, including 1 large (male), 2 smaller whales & a calf, heading west at
9:20 am Saturday.
*
We saw large numbers of
orcas
in the
afternoon
, at least 20 orca from Cattle Point. They were there when we arrived around

12:15
and we observed them heading north. We watched them arrive and pass the Westside Preserve area starting about 3 pm. There appeared to be two "waves" with a large number in each group. Again they were fairly active with some spyhopping and showmanship. We caught up with them at the San Juan County Park where some circled the little offshore island. By this time it was probably 4 pm and we continued to observe them move north.

decided to come back and do an early morning "west side shuffle" while they waited for J's & K's to arrive. As we were going down Cattle Pass, another boat thought they saw a humpback in San Juan Channel, but after searching for about 20 minutes, none of the boats could find it---perhaps it was a big minke? Anyway, we had
J's & L's
at False Bay, lots of foraging, tail slaps, spy hops, and quite a few half-breaches and one full belly-flop breach.

At

4:00pm
we saw four of the Hood Canal
transients
at the south side of the Hood Canal bridge. They were there for a short time and then turned around and went back south. They appeared to be in transit. There was no tail slaps or breeching, just movement to the bridge and then back south.
The Lowery's
(East bank 1/4 mile south of bridge)
*
Located
orcas
milling close to shore with lots of surface activity just below the American Camp flagpole at

10:30 am
. Seemed to go in circles; out to Haro Strait and back for 1.5 hours broken up into subgroups of 5-12 animals.
