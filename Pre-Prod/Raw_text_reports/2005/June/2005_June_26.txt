The slippery six (Hood Canal
Transients
) were sighted in front of Holly at about

8:50 pm
. They were quite active. I had about 25 seals close to the bank also aware that the "6" were in the area.

J's & K's
near False Bay, heading out towards Hein Bank. Once out there they milled about for awhile before deciding to head back into shore. Once at False Bay, they got very active for a brief time, then back to the slow milling towards Eagle Cove. Keeping to tradition of the West Side Shuffle, they changed direction several more times as they slowly milled North towards Lime Kiln. K-7 Lummi showing a couple of young'uns how to fish. Back and forth in bursts of speed within 20 yards of the Soundwatch boat! As the whales passed Lime Kiln near shore, they put on quite a show of breaches and other percussive behaviors for those waiting on shore. Then it was onwards towards Kellett Bluff.

HJ Carroll (WSPR) Marine Park, Dabob Bay, Hood Canal,
noon to one
in the afternoon, halfway between Pulali and Whitney Point, the six transients. The whales spent about forty-five minutes within in a small area of about 200 feet, moving in close formation. They travel a hundred feet south, then north, sometimes side by side, and sometimes closely passing each other. The babies appear to stay very closely beside the mothers. At least two spyhops from one of the large (fe)males, and much tail-slapping. Appears to be a "kill" given small debris and attention of gulls. Group then moves slowly south towards mouth of Dabob Bay near Pulali Point. A larger transient group appeared in this spot frequently during the eight-week 2003 transient incursion to Hood Canal.
