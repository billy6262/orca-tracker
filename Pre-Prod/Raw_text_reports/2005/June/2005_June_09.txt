We encountered
J's
off the south side of San Juan Island today, working the salmon. They were heading west when we caught up with them around

10:45
, and had reversed direction by the time we left (around noon). Ruffles was quite friendly, and came up very close to the boat!

Reports of
J Pod
at Hein Bank and
K Pod
at Open Bay made for a roll of the dice and we went North to see the K's. Found them near Moat Point (Pender Island) where they were traveling in two groups. They were very active near the point with lots of breaches, tail slabs, tail lobs, and spyhops. Several times we observed the younger whales pushing and shoving under each other as if they were trying to flip each other over. No vocalizations, just some "rowdy" play behavior.
