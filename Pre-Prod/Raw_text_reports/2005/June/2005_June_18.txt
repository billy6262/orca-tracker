Orca Sightings for June 18, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We caught up with a very spread-out
J-Pod
near Moat Point, and they were fairly active with tail slaps, tail lobs, and breaches. We saw J-27 Blackberry off by himself, and just as we were leaving, it appeared that J-1 Ruffles may have been fishing as he changed direction several times quite quickly.
