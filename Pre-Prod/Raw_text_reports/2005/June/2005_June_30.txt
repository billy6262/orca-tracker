Orca Sightings for June 30, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I spotted
orca
activity while crossing the Hood Canal bridge (east to west) to day. At about

3:50 pm
I looked toward the south while on the bridge and saw several splashes and black fins. There was another person watching and said he had seen five orca, including a small one. We watched this small group for at least 45 minutes. They were ranging north and south and appeared to be hunting. They spent several long periods underwater. A couple times one of the larger animals jumped almost completely out (horizontally). One appeared to be much smaller and there did not appear to be any bulls with the group. At least three of them had dorsals about the same size (medium). They ranged back and forth over the same area while we watched and appeared to be no more than halfway between the county park and Lofall on the east side.
