In Haro Strait we were able to confirm that L47 has a new calf.

Rob Hollingshead, with WDFW, reported 2 groups of four
orcas
in each, each group with one adult male, passed by the Westport harbor at
1400
, at 46N 55.228 x 124W 10.4.

I watched the Hood Canal
Orcas
from afar during sunset between
9pm and
9:30pm
. I didnt get a count. They were closer to the western shore and just north of Hoodsport. Lots of jumping, rolling, splashing, etc in one location. They very gradually headed north until out of view.

We caught up with
K's and L's
in Haro strait. It was pretty rough, but got a good look at k40 & K21. It was great as they were all grouped up together. Just behind them came a good portion of L's. This was my first encounter with them this year and it was fabulous to see L57 and lots of sprouters. On our way back in we were honored with another orca encounter. At Eagle Point, there were the L12's. L41 did two breaches, followed by a smaller whale.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at

6:30 pm
to report
J, K & L pods
heading up Swanson Channel. They also observed what looked like a new calf with L47.

In the
afternoon
we had a SUPERPOD (
J, K, & L Pod
) coming towards False Bay from BC. The whales were spread out over a large area for most of the day, until they got near Open Bay (San Juan Island). Waves were 3-4 feet at times, making observation tricky at times. There they began grouping up and we saw a lot of percussives--multiple breaches, tail slaps, tail lobs, cartwheels, and several "sea snakes". We even had 4 double breaches (2 whales breaching at the same time!) Good to see J-1 (Ruffles) wasn't the only big male around as the L Pod males were struttin' their stuff as well. Towards the end of the day we heard a rumor of a baby orca in possible distress and swimming a bit listlessly, but it turns out that it appears that L-47 has a new baby! The baby was observed by Robin & Candy with Cascadia Research to be swimming in close attendance of L-47 and an auntie. We ended the day with whales swimming between Henry Island and Stuart Island, slowly moving North.

North of Salmon Bank we had
J's, K's and L's
. We had all the guys together, J1, L41, L57 and some of the sprouters including K21.
