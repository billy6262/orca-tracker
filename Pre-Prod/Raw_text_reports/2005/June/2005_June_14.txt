Orca Sightings for June 14, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I watched the
HCTransients
for about an hour. They were first spotted south of Pleasant Harbor at
6pm
in travel mode. They were heading north very close to the west side. The Orcas passed by the Dosewallips and kept going, trying to make headway against the current in very choppy water. Then the group stopped near Seal Rock to make a kill with seagulls picking up what was left. Lost sight of them heading north up into the mouth of Dabob Bay around 7ish.

Don and I were at Big Beef Creek (on the Kitsap side) and got to see a little of the
Slippery Six
heading north just south of Ayock Pt at
1.45pm
. The Six possibly made several kills just south of Seal Rock and north of the Dosewallips delta between about
6.20 to 7.00+ pm
. These actions seemed to be between the two kills.

Today we were coming over to Orcas Island on the

2:30 pm
ferry from Anacortes and we saw a pod of
Orcas
coming down Bellingham Channel. There must have been 10-15 - we were not very close.

Whales
were heading north towards Lighthouse (

I just spotted my first sighting this year out of Freshwater Bay, West of Port Angeles. Five
Orcas
heading West at

6:10 Am
. There was 1 male with a very large dorsal fin, 3 females all about the same size and 1 smaller Orca in the group. I heard them flapping their tails on the water as they swam past.
