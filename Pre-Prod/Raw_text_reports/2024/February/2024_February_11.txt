But there were more than four, videos incoming! They’ve continued south in Rosario close to Lummi side [video in FB comments]! -screengrabs from video by Rose Caitlin, February 10, 2024*Sat, Feb 10 - Puget Sound (T87, T100Bs + new calf designated T100B3, T100E) - T100B Freya & T100E Tharaya - T100B1 & T100B3 -IDs by Rachel Haight, Orca Network*Just when you think a beautiful winter day couldn't get any better weather wise, some beautiful transient orcas came for a little visit and just brighten the whole day. Today T87 (Harbeson the oldest known male transient estimated to be born around 1962) along with T100E (Tharaya a female born in 2009) and the T100B Freya is a female born in 1997 and T100B1 (not sexed, born in 2010) and a tiny little surprise. Yes, that is an adorable new baby in the group. Presumed to be T100B3 but I won’t say for sure until officially released. Freya did have one more calf born in 2016 that didn't survive and was taken off the census in 2017. Fun fact - they are related to the T101s which makes Freya, Reef’s granddaughter. I can't get enough of learning and sharing about these beauties. Just want to say that citizen science contributes to the bigger picture for these whales we all love. Link to more photos. -photos by April Basham, February 10, 2024*The experience was shared and captured by many. Enjoy. Link to more photos. -photos by Craig Killer, February 10, 2024*T100B Freya & T100B3 - Little calf cruising by Southworth earlier. -photos by Mollie Segall, February 10, 2024*T100B3 & T100B Freya - T87 Harbeson - On Saturday, with no recent reports of orcas inland, it was a sweet surprise to hear a report of orcas down in Dalco Passage. Had just enough time to grab my gear and sprint down to the beach and try and meet whoever this was as they moved northbound in Colvos Passage. Sun on the west side of the island made for some intense glare looking south, but soon, a flash of light caught my eye, mid channel just north of Point Richmond, which turned out to be sunlight bouncing off an impressive giant shiny dorsal. As he got close enough to snap a picture of, I could see immediately that it was none other than the most dapper Silver Fox there is, Harbeson/T087. Harbeson is thought to be the oldest living male in the west coast transient orca population, estimated to be in his early to mid sixties. He is an incredibly impressive male, and sports a small hooked top of his dorsal and a nice sized chunk missing on the trailing edge near the tip, a pretty significant identifiable feature. It’s a sigh of relief to see him still cruising the Salish, and so grateful for each year we get to see him traveling through these waters. As they approached, I could see three others with him, plus a tiny, itty bitty dorsal. Soon, a blunt little rostrum broke the surface with that light peachy pink glow, and could see what appeared to be a very young, possibly new-ish baby. Besides Harbeson, the rest of the group did not look familiar and were fins I didn’t recognize right away, new-to-me whales. After some conversations with our team and other eyes on the pictures, Monika Wieland Shields over at Orca Behavior Institute determined them to be T100E and T100Bs with a previously undocumented baby in tow. A newbie! Being able to see one of, if not the oldest orca in this population, as well as possibly one of the youngest, traveling together, was incredibly special. Wishing this new little babe, which is looking likely to be T100B3, a robust year of health. Welcome, little one! -photos by Marla Smith, February 10, 2024*T100B Freya & T100B3 -T100B Freya, T100B1, T100B3, T100E Tharaya -IDs by Rachel Haight, Orca Network*Transient orcas visited central Puget Sound.

South of Vashon, toward east of Vashon.Behaviors observed: Seemed to be traveling. We had two brief surfaces, then nothing.If orcas, any males?: Probably males, longer, thinner dorsal fins.Any unusual markings?: Too far away to tell. When I looked with binoculars, no more sightings.Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: My wife and I both made the above observation (the second right after first) just before noon Saturday. We are staying at Airbnb next to Sunrise Beach Drive, had small fire pit fire. From 10:20pm until about midnight, we could hear what sounded to us to be whale breaths (sleeping whales?) with an occasional splash. The sounds were intermittent, mostly singles, sometimes two or three close together, sometimes farther off, sometimes pretty close. Orcas? We had seen a number of harbor seals earlier in day. Do they make that blowing exhale sound?Photos available?: No*1154 - From Dune, looking towards Gig Harbor, closer to Gig Harbor side, facing north at the moment.

Taken at Camano State Park. Link to more photos. -photos by Charvet Drucker, February 10, 2024*Evening with CRC53 Little Patch in Saratoga Passage - I’ve been resting the last few days and finally got out yesterday to look for this gray whale. He was reported passing Camano Island State Park close to shore and rounding the point into Elger Bay in the afternoon, just before high tide. I was hoping he would feed in the same spot as the day before, so I headed down to a beach just south of Elger Bay. He started off feeding where I was expecting before continuing south until he was directly in front of me, where he stayed for the rest of the evening. The water was incredibly calm the whole time and I listened to his blows until it got dark. All photos and video taken from shore on Camano. Link to more photos & videos. -photos by Serena Tierra, February 10, 2024*18:15 - He's somewhere to the southwest of me. Has stopped feeding, longer downtimes between surface intervals.
