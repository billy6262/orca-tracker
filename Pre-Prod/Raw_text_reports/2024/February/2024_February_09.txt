February 8BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Thu, Feb 8 - Strait of Juan de Fuca (T2B, T41s, & T109Bs minus T109B3) - Excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter #14: “A tight group of exhalations caught their attention at 1114 slightly south of their position abeam of Albert Head, marking the commencement of the encounter. Brendon identified the whales as the T041s, T109Bs and T002B. This provided a total count of eight whales in light of T109B3's absence. The whales maintained a steady pace of 4 knots while in a resting formation. By 1127, the pod veered southwestward, setting a course for William Head. Over the course of the next several surfacings, their movements became more dynamic and the group began to weave between inshore and offshore waters, with dive times averaging six minutes. Prior to one of these dives, the team noticed new rake marks on T041A’s left side and T041A3’s dorsal fin…” Read more here at Center for Whale Research Encounter #14.UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Thu, Feb 8 - Strait of GeorgiaSent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Olivia GrahamDate of Sighting: February 08, 2024Time: 4:37 PMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 3Where seen: 48.77 N 123.04 WDirection of travel : NE, relaxed paceBehaviors observed: Traveling at a relaxed pace south of Saturna Island, seen off the Coastal Inspiration heading towards VancouverIf orcas, any males?: NoAny unusual markings?:Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: Could only see 2-3 mature female dorsal fins at a time.

February 7BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Wed, Feb 7 - San Juans - Working on Orcas Island this past Wednesday [02/07], I spotted these orca off the west side of the island. I heard them first! They appeared to be hunting. My first wild orca encounter. I got to pet Tillikum’s tongue when I was a kid. I'm from Appalachia where we have no whales. Made my work day all the better! -photos by Michael Thomas, February 7, 2024*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Michael ThomasDate of Sighting: February 07, 2024Time: 10:49 AM Species seen: Orca podNumber of animals seen: 5Where seen: South West side of Orcas islandDirection of travel : North slowBehaviors observed: HuntingIf orcas, any males?: 2Any unusual markings?:Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?:Photos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org*Wed, Feb 7 - San Juans (T99s) - As promised, here's is Jason's video of our encounter with the T99s last week! We caught up with them in San Juan Channel on the afternoon of February 7th and saw a little bit of everything: resting, traveling, socializing, and a short but epic harbor porpoise hunt. (Please note that while the video does not contain blood and gore it does contain footage of the porpoise being rammed by the whales.) -Orca Behavior Institute -video by Jason Shields, February 7, 2024*It was not a good day to be a harbor porpoise in San Juan Channel! The T99s went from 0-60 in a matter of seconds as they broke from resting formation and went straight into a high speed hunt. The pursuit only lasted a couple of minutes before T99C Barakat punted the porpoise a good 15-20 feet into the air. -Orca Behavior Institute -photo by Monika Wieland Shields, February 7, 2024*15:40 - T99s still moving northwest close to San Juan shoreline between Point Caution and Mineral Point. Good time to run to Reuben Tarte! -Barbara Howitt [WSSJI]*14:40 - Approaching Friday Harbor northbound on San Juan side of channel.14:20 - Still northbound off Turn Island heading towards Friday Harbor.13:45 - T99s now northbound off Pear Point on San Juan shoreline after having porpoise for lunch.13:03 - Direction change west towards Pear Point. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute [WSSJI]*12:27 - John Miller, WSF Marine Ops, emailed at 12:43 to report: 1227hrs: Vessel [SEALTH] reports 4 orca moving in a southbound direction in San Juan Channel, south of Shaw Island. *12:25 - Now more mid channel southbound towards Griffin Bay.12:15 - Now southbound again, I think San Juan Channel but not 100% committed yet.12:05 - Just south of Friday Harbor, T99s milling on a possible kill. Still on Shaw side.11:00 - Orcas seen from the inter-island ferry along the Shaw Island shoreline in San Juan Channel; no direction of travel given. -Orca Behavior Institute [WSSJI]*GRAY WHALES - Wed, Feb 7 - North Saratoga Passage (CRC56 Stardust & CRC2441)14:18 - 2441 is trending south, just fluked.14:14 - Just saw a blow west of Maple Grove, in the same area as earlier sighting of 2441.13:48 - Was walking back to my car after looking for CRC56 at Utsalady Vista Point and spotted 2441 at the location of Bart's map (just north of his boat for anyone else out looking). I'm heading over to Maple Grove to get a closer look. -Serena Tierra, Orca Network*13:45 - CRC-2441 is still circling at my map spot [approx. 48.261619, -122.563963].13:00 - Gray whale CRC-2441 is circling at my map spot [approx. 48.248521, -122.544451]!12:05 - Gray whale CRC-56 “Stardust” is eastbound at my blue map spot [approx. 48.266914, -122.510426]. -Bart Rulon Wildlife*11:57 - Don’t know if it is same whale but seeing one mid channel west of orange channel marker between Utsalady Point and Strawberry Point heading east.10:50 - Spouting midchannel between Strawberry Point [Whidbey] and Utsalady Point [Camano] heading east - think it’s a gray. -Pat Sebelsky [CWW]*Wed, Feb 7 - Saratoga Passage (CRC53 Little Patch) - CRC53 Little Patch. Link to more photos. -photos by Cindi Crowder Rausch, February 7, 2024*As I headed home this morning I stopped along the Saratoga shores looking for the greys. As I was getting near home, I see a blow quarter mid channel out. I saw from Orca Network it was Bart who initially posted Little Patch’s sighting. Thank you Bart. I watched for a bit then relocated across the street from my place and watched Little Patch head a little north and westbound… I kept my eye on him until he was about halfway to three quarters way towards Greenbank and looking like maybe Hidden Beach. I think by other reports he was on path a bit south of Hidden Beach. I messaged Christy that I was heading to Hidden.... she was on her way to do errands and such in Freeland. We met up and she drove us to Hidden Beach. We pulled in to the parking lot and not too long after, Little Patch found us… he was heading from the south of Hidden. It's like WOW. Yes - my heart was full. Christy had thrown on her grey whale necklace before leaving home. I think that is what did it! She and Little Patch were channeling each other. Link to more photos.  -photos by Marilyn Armbruster, February 7, 2024*Fun to catch up with Gray Whale #53 "Little Patch" as he fed just off Hidden Beach this afternoon.

February 6BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Tue, Feb 6 - Haro Strait (T60D & T60E) - Excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter #13: “Dave and Michael headed towards the whales, but they went down on another long dive. Next time the team saw them, they were 2/3 mile off shore of the team. Finally, on the next sequence, the whales surfaced just a few hundred yards to their south. The team was able to approach the whales and begin their encounter. The team quickly IDed the two males as T60D and T60E, whales that had been well documented in previous encounters. The whales briefly milled, and then continued swimming quickly to the north. As the whales approached Zero Rock, they split up, with T60D going further east while T60E passed near Zero Rock. The team stayed with the whales until the research vessel Skana was able to get on scene, and then ended their encounter at 10:40…” Read more here at Center for Whale Research Encounter #13.*10:05 - T60D and T60E are now closer to the Vancouver Island side but still northbound, currently near Gordon Head.09:35 - Two orcas mid-Haro off Lime Kiln heading north. -Orca Behavior Institute [WSSJI]*HUMPBACK WHALES - Tue, Feb 6 - Hawaii (BCY1218 Kata) - Per Happywhale, our lovely humpback friend Kata, who spends time inland Salish Sea, is in Hawaii!

February 5SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) - Mon, Feb 5 - North Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet (J Pod) - J47 Notch on right - A few days ago, a friend and I watched a large group of whales approach from the north skirting down Whidbey Island! When I pulled up my first picture - it was clear that we had our endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales coming for a visit. A few more pictures clarified that it was J pod. Well, they went between central and north Puget Sound for a couple of days, then, they decided they had had enough of us, and they headed back up Admiralty to exit the sound. I caught them from Shore Meadows, then followed to Bush Point, Lagoon Point, and finally Fort Casey. I normally don't bother going to Casey in the winter. That bluff is COLD and WINDY. You can watch from the warmth of your cozy car if you park by the lighthouse. Guess what I did? We observed a common, but interesting behavior during this encounter - logging, AKA, napping! Orca never fully go to sleep. They are voluntary breathers, meaning they must make the decision to breathe. Because of this… half their brain stays active when they nap. Now, we had a group of four take a siesta about 75 yards off shore from us. The logging itself was fairly uneventful… I mean, it is napping, but they startled awake, flipped and sped off in a blink of an eye. Now that was interesting! In my pictures, when the whales are facing left, they are sleeping… right, they are awake. Link to more photos. -photos by Cindi Crowder Rausch, February 5, 2024*From Bush Point earlier! -back of camera photos by Jami Cantrell, February 5, 2024*16:54 - Mid channel viewing from Fort Ebey. Quite a few breaches, still headed north. -Bethani White*16:31 - Jpod has cleared Casey and continued north! Fair and following! -Cindi Crowder Rausch*16:25 - Continued north/northwest past Fort Casey Lighthouse. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*16:16 - Audible J pod calls on Port Townsend hydrophone.  -Orca Network*16:15 - From Fort Casey, watching about 15 whales northbound - most on the east side of the tug boat, spread out but still distant. -Jill Hein*16:14 - First clear SRKW call, an S01, on Port Townsend hydrophone via Orcasound - Listen for Whales app.  -Scott Veirs, Orcasound*16:09 - Spread, passing or past ferry lanes now.16:04 - Groups spread from just south of Fort Casey to more midchannel nearing ferry lanes, northbound. We saw two whales spyhop in sync, soo pretty! -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*16:04 - Sighted mid channel straight out from Coupeville ferry terminal moving northbound. -Debi Smith Stapel*15:50 - Possible faint calls on Port Townsend hydrophone. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*Mon, Feb 5 - Puget Sound (J Pod) - J Pod in Admiralty Inlet. Link to more photos. -photos by April Janice Basham, February 5, 2024*15:28 - Paula Ratcliff called to report watching at least some of pod pass by off Lagoon Point, and at least one group with large male have turned more towards Admiralty Bay after passing by. They’ve been down a few minutes so unsure which direction they are going at this point.*15:25 - They've passed Lagoon Point. Spread east to west. Northbound. This group logged facing south close to Lagoon Point, then suddenly woke up & continued north.15:05 - Approaching Lagoon Point Whidbey side of midchannel northbound.14:40 - Believe that was trailing group, all passed Bush Point now. Last group east of mid. Still northbound.14:35 - J47 Notch in group passing Bush Point now. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*15:09 - I must have been catching them on the way away. One more faint call noted and now quiet for about fifteen minutes. I’ll take what I can get! -Marie Wils*14:25 - Approaching Bush Point. Mid to other. Still northbound and now spread out.13:56 - Seeing fins from Shore Meadow. Still south of Foulweather, west of mid. They seem to be grouping up. Still northbound. -Cindi Crowder Rausch*12:44 - Seeing fins midchannel between Point No Point and Double Bluff, multidirectional, looking like foraging. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network*12:42 - Some now in view from Sunlight Beach neighborhood. Some surface activity. Headed north. Approx. here [48.944886, -122.513967]? Hard to tell from where I'm at, weird perspective. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*12:05 - Passing Point No Point northbound. -David Michael*11:34 - They were close by the barge. Thank you! And thanks again to the woman that lent me her binoculars. -Jen Holt*11:00 - Have slowed a bit but still west side of channel moving towards Point No Point. Maybe a bit north of Eglon now and maybe a bit further east. Only able to see breaches now from Apple Tree Point.10:35 - Continued steady northbound travel with surface activity. Well past the ferry now. West side of channel. -Sara Frey*10:23 - Sara Frey called and updates a nice large group is more on the west side passing through Kingston/Edmonds ferry traffic lanes, with others still south of. While on the phone someone was porpoising/lunging, and someone else breached.*10:25 - Seeing a couple of large splashes on the west side of the channel near Kingston northbound approaching the sailboat. -Brooke Thompson*10:24 - Seeing at least one north of Edmonds ferry lanes, about midchannel, northbound. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*10:18 - And seeing some just north of the ferry… adult male.10:15 - Saw a breach around the ferry lane, west side of mid channel.09:10 - Hearing many orca are northbound off President Point [Kingston]. -Sara Frey *09:00 - Thank you to all who posted. I was on my sailboat off President Point this morning when we spotted them heading north. It was a great show, lots of breaching. Very impressive. One of the orca was noticeably smaller so I was curious how young it was? I only saw four orca and they seemed to be traveling in pairs. The larger pair were closer to us on the west side of shipping channel. The smaller pair were closer to mid-channel. -Sharons Husband*GRAY WHALES - Mon, Feb 5 - Saratoga Passage14:55 - Still roughly the same area. Has pushed west a bit more but still generally midchannel.14:23 - It’s still hanging out in the same place, maybe more in line with Summerland. Hard to tell exact location from where I am viewing.14:04 - Found it again from the state park, mid channel, at or a little north of Mabana. Appears to be going northbound.  -Charvet Drucker*10:12 - Spotted a gray whale blow south of the Summerland neighborhood a little while ago from the state park.  -Charvet Drucker [CWW]*08:49 - Seeing a blow south of Mabana on the Camano side. Presumed gray whale. Viewing from Camano Island State Park. Unable to tell direction of travel. Might be northbound. -Linda Aitkins

No sense of numbers but not a lot as of yet anyhow. Southbound. Same general location, see map [approx. 47.700491 -122.473911].10:25 - Would be too far for the Kingston whale and visibility is hazy across the Sound but spotted disturbance and what looked like possible blows transect Richmond Beach Saltwater Park and Fay Bainbridge closer west side of channel. Will keep trying to confirm. No boats in or near vicinity so would not be wake or vessel generated. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*09:50 - Donna Sanders, WSF Marine Ops, emailed at 09:51 to report: Captain [of KALEETAN] reports one orca SB near KING.*BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Sun, Feb 4 - Strait of Juan de Fuca (T60D & T60E) - Excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter #12: “They crossed the Victoria waterfront before coming to a stop ~ 2 nm south west of Seabird Point to conduct a scan of the area where the whales had last been seen. With no visual of the reported whales, the two continued ahead along a southeast course with a moderate north wind and two foot chop on their port quarter; at 1125 Mark detected an exhalation in his peripheral vision approximately a quarter mile south of the vessel’s position, signalling the beginning of the encounter ~ 3 nm south of Discovery Island. It wasn’t until several minutes later that the whales reappeared, this time slightly north of Mike 1. Mark turned the boat into the short, now increasing waves and gradually navigated towards their position. The first animal to be photographed was T060D, a 20-year-old bull who is most frequently accompanied by his younger brother, T060E. A few seconds later, the latter also surfaced, his tell-tale notches unmistakable...” -Read more here at Center for Whale Research Encounter #12.*UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Sun, Feb 4 - Strait of Juan de Fuca 09:49 - Was able to see them from a couple different locations and elevations seem to be moving fairly quickly based on that.09:46 - Possible group of orcas spread out heading north/northwest north of Smith and Minor heading towards Lopez or San Juan?

February 3SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) - Sat, Feb 3 - Puget Sound (J Pod) - We spent the weekend looking for J-Pod in Puget Sound, and they did not make it very easy! Our best look came from the Edmonds-Kingston ferry crossing on Saturday when we caught up with our buddy J47 Notch, who seems to have grown a bit since we last got a good look at him three months ago. At 14 years old, he looks promising to fill out into a male with a pretty tall dorsal fin. Even though most of the whales were further away, the conditions and lighting were sublime to see them in. It originally looked like they might exit Puget Sound after just 24 hours, but we were glad they decided to stay, hopefully indicating they found something prey-wise worth sticking around for. -Orca Behavior Institute -photo by Monika Wieland Shields, February 3, 2024*From Edmonds on Saturday with J pod. -photos by Janine Harles, February 3, 2024*The Southern Resident Orcas visited central Puget Sound today. Here's a few pictures of these endangered orcas. Link to more photos. -photos by Mike Maddox, February 3, 2024*Happy to see the residents today! Not a super close pass at the marina in Edmonds but still amazing to see them! -photos by Charvet Drucker, February 3, 2024*J59 Sxwyeqόlh & J37 Hy'shqa - J56 Tofino - J56 Tofino -photos & IDs by K.

Frolicking north at a good pace but with lots of tail slapping & breaches, but then a cargo ship came behind them. I left there around 15:30. -Missy Main*15:43 - Four to six more traveling northwest on Whidbey side.15:24 - Two males were in the lead, two groups closer together: first group about four, second group about three. Really distant views, even with my binoculars, so difficult to tell exact numbers. Still northwest.15:20 - Surface activity noted.15:17 - Definitely appear more grouped up and still headed northwestbound. Approaching Cultus Bay.15:14 - At least five or six, including two males, loosely grouped trending northwest closer to Whidbey side of channel and mid viewing from Point No Point.

Pretty close to shore here. -Jaime McBroom*Sat, Feb 3 - Saratoga Passage (CRC53 Little Patch) - An amazing wonderful morning with Little Patch CRC53 in the hood. I love this boy. First saw him around 10:30 between Fox Spit and Bells Beach/Whidbey Island. He stayed in that general area feeding at high tide for about three hours. He was a joy to watch… it was a serene and calm morning. Even with my hearing disability, I could hear his soothing exhalations. Most photos zoomed and many cropped. Link to more photos. -photos by Marilyn Armbruster, February 3, 2024*13:15 - He is done feeding and has head out from shore about mid channel aimed south but moving slow (full belly). Line of sight would be north end of Bells Beach and heart of Elger Bay. I hope you'll see his blows out there on this beautiful calm day.12:40 - Still in same general area, in between Fox and Bells. It is Little Patch. Hoping he is getting lots of eats. Tide is starting to go out.11:30 - Still in same area but has gone out from shore lunging, I say burping, which Little Patch does. I can't say for sure it is Little Patch as I have not been able to view left side or tail/pec fins.10:30 - Grey whale in between Fox Spit and Bells Beach feeding. -Marilyn Armbruster
