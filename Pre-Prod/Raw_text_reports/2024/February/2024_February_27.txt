============================================================

Entry 1:
February 26BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Mon, Feb 26 - Puget Sound (T46s & T124Ds) - Male is T46E Thor - From Southworth this morning. It was quick! And the light was wrong as usual from this side in the morning. I got there just as they reached the ferry terminal. They stopped for a brief hunt, harbor porpoise I think that didn't appear to be successful. The only one I'm familiar with here is Thor. Wake is gone and Strider is off on his own. Link to more photos. -photos by Jim Pasola, February 26, 2024*T46E Thor - Today was an incredible day as I witnessed the T46s, excluding T46D and 124Ds transient orca families, traveling northbound through Seattle. I put my new camera to the test and I’m still learning but pretty happy with the pictures so far. I hope you all enjoy them too. Link to more photos. -photos by April Janice Basham, February 26, 2024*16:32 - Kim P called to report the pod is now between Eglon and Pilot Point heading northbound toward Point No Point, very close in to shore. They saw four, including male and little one.*16:30 - I counted five. About a mile offshore. -Ryan Campbell*T46E Thor 15:15 - Much closer to Kitsap side now. Others may have caught up.15:05 - Passing Apple Tree Point west edge of shipping lanes. Male, female and juvenile. Saw a few further behind and trending northeast, maybe at the ferry line. -photos by Sara Frey, February 26, 2024*14:45 - Thor northbound in Apple Tree Cove/ferry lanes. -photo by Ariel Yseth, February 26, 2024*T46E Thor - 14:41 - This must be Thor as well! Ferries gave wide berth - I was at the top of Saltair Beach by the ferry. -photos by Deanna Deery-Schmitt, February 26, 2024*14:30 - Definitely fits the moody weather of the day. T46E Thor passing Kingston northbound. -April Janice Basham*14:40 - Thor group trailing back closer to Kingston terminal. All steady northbound.14:38 - One group Ts basically threading the ferries, they are in between the two. Eastbound ferry has slowed some. Orcas continue northbound travels.14:29 - Update with General location. In two groups steady northbound. Thor in trailing group from my vantage across the Sound at Kayu Kayu.14:20 - Steady northbound in groups. Just caught a spy hop by a bigger someone in the T124D group (little one in there). They are north of President Point, west side of channel. Should be nice pass at Kingston. 14:12 - They are moving at medium fast pace now north of buoy about quarter mile.14:09 - Ts are about at mid channel buoy that is between Kayu Kayu Ac and President Point, Kingston west side of channel. Steady northbound together with some spread [approx. 47.755858, -122.458764]. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*14:10 - They are approaching the Kingston ferry closer to Kitsap side northbound still. -April Janice Basham*13:47 - Now north/northeast bound heading out of Port Madison toward main channel/Jefferson Head. Viewing from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. -Ariel Yseth, Whale Scout*13:45 - Definitely moved northeast. I’m seeing Ts grouped up out from southeast Jefferson Head (see map) [approx. 47.741512, -122.472410]. Appear northbound-ish but angle makes it unclear if committed or another hunt? -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*13:38 - I actually do see them now! They just finished their lingering (maybe a kill) and are now northbound again. Just passing the bluffs north of Indianola. -Joe Olson*13:28 - Ts are still in that same general area just inside Port Madison midway between north end Bainbridge and Jefferson Head probably hunting/feeding. See map from earlier update. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*13:29 - Same spot as Alisa’s post. -Ariel Yseth, Whale Scout*13:15 - Now barely visible (with binos). -Jane Christopherson*13:10 - They do appear to be circling around. Lots of harbor porpoise inhabit that area so maybe they are up to hunting.13:00 - T46E and others generally just inside Port Madison about midway up. Maybe trend northbound or stalled [approx. 47.725296, -122.482777]. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*12:50 - They have passed Fay Bainbridge Park and are currently westbound towards Port Madison. -Candace Gavin*12:24 - Reports that they are viewable from Sunset Hill with binoculars. -Wendy Willis Miller*12:23 - They are across from Golden Gardens on the [Bainbridge] side. -Rachael Green*12:22 - Across from Golden Gardens by Fay Bainbridge Park. -Bobby Kania*12:06 - Saw two from Rolling Bay on Bainbridge.

Followed by small (research?) boat. -Jim Reitz*11:06 - Seen headed northbound from Eagle Harbor. Quick clip. Water distortion is making it hard. Viewing from Myrtle Edwards Park. -Taylor Seyl*11:04 - Past Eagle Harbor line of sight. Moving fast north.10:55 - Passing Blakely Rocks. Close together. This was viewed from 64th Alki. -Steve Rice*10:53 - Saw them way across southern tip of Bainbridge. Took a long dive and lost them but they’re northbound. -Alexander Simenstad*10:40 - Spotted from Constellation Park. Just south of the southern tip of Bainbridge. Headed north. -Steve Rice*10:32 - Back to northbound closer to Seattle shore coming up on those big condos over the water, then Alki lighthouse next. Viewed from Manchester.10:26 - Headed due east towards West Seattle, north of the anchored ship.10:18 - Passing by the two anchored ships going northbound headed toward Bainbridge more north east direction - view from Manchester fuel dock. -Noelle Morris*10:15 - From Manchester between the near and middle ships. Looks like they're hunting, they were moving north but last seen circling; they're behind the ship now. -Jim Pasola*10:06 - Right off Manchester fuel dock. -Noelle Morris*09:56 - They are here between two ships headed west about to pass Blake Island. -Jordan Preston*09:55 - After moving to Manchester lost them for a bit; just relocated them about in the same area between the green and the red ships that are inside of Blake Island, also a group of harbor porpoises in the same area. They're now moving north east towards Blake.09:37 - Heading up the west side of Blake Island towards Manchester.09:20 - They're right off the Southwest ferry dock hunting something, Thor confirmed. -Jim Pasola*08:55 - Mid channel viewing from Driftwood Cove, just off Peter Point. -Roxane Jackson Johnson*08:15 - In Colvos Passage about approx. four orcas passed by Andersen County Park heading north towards Southworth.

February 24BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Sat, Feb 24 - Holmes Harbor/Saratoga Passage (T36, T36Bs, & T137s) - T137A Jack & T137 Loon - T36B4, T36B Tattertip, T36 Flapjack - It was cold and gray but seeing wee T36B4 and many of her extended family warmed my heart. T137 (Loon) is T36B4’s Auntie, and T137A, T137B & T137D are the little’s cousins. Lovely pass at Sandy Point. Link to more photos. -photos & IDs by Cindi Crowder Rausch, February 24, 2024*T137 Loon - T137A Jack, T137 Loon, T137D Wright - Third consecutive days trying to keep up with orcas, starting with the T36s and T137s giving it large with lots of percussive activity, breaching, tail-slapping and high-energy action as they pursued a harbor porpoise in Holmes Harbor, Freeland. After heading north into Saratoga Passage the whales turned south, delighting spectators as they made a close pass rounding Sandy Point before the T36s shaved the shore at Brighton Beach. All whales broke through the Clinton/Mukilteo lanes then continued on past Glendale and Possession boat ramp until disappearing from view.  -photos by Sandy Pollard, February 24, 2024*T137A Jack, T36B1 Bhotia, T36B4 -photo by RJ Snowberger, February 24, 2024*T137D Wright in middle & T36B4 leading - Spyhop from when they passed Langley. -photos by Ryan Eatinger, February 24, 2024*T137B Tempest, T36B1 Bhotia, T36B4 - Fin tip of T137B Tempest, T36B Tattertip, T137A Jack, T36B1 Bhotia -photos & IDs by Rachel Haight, February 24, 2024*It has been exciting to see T36B4, the new calf of Tattertip (T36B) lately here in Puget Sound! Here are some video clips from trips with Puget Sound Express on Feb 23 and 24 that show the new calf. The first two clips show the calf surfacing right next to mom in the “typical” mom/calf formation. In the last clip the calf comes up for a breath right next to T137B (Tempest) while both pods were traveling together that day. The slow-motion video does not have any sound. Link to video. -Bart Rulon Wildlife*15:41 - Watched them pass Possession Point State Park about 20 minutes ago then lost them, southbound closer to Mukilteo side. -Ryan Eatinger*14:42 - They just passed Glendale.14:14 - Spread again. Some through the ferry lanes. Some still behind. Some Whidbey side, some mid channel. -Cindi Crowder Rausch*14.10 - Surprise, surprise!

T36Bs & T137s! -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*10:25 - Friend reports they are viewing from Honeymoon Bay and whales are moving north out of Holmes Harbor. -Emily Wandres*10:30 - The orcas may be trending north. Difficult to tell from this distance. They seem to have settled down a bit, less activity but still seeing at least five blows.10:20 - Lots of action! Huge splashes and tail slapping. At least four whales still in same area. -Sandy Pollard*10:14 - Viewing from Freeland Park. They are mid channel and I believe they are north of the golf course. My binos are busted, so not much help. I think one male, milling. Just saw a breach. -Cindi Crowder Rausch*10:12 - We saw them too! Two miles up on east side seen from west side home. -Jennifer Garber Abermanis*10:00 - Can confirm Catherine's sighting, mid harbor and milling around. -Cindi Bowen*09:42 - Pod of about five orcas, including male, hunting harbor porpoise deep in Holmes Harbor down by the park, mid channel out from the Golf Course pier.  -Catherine Drews*Sent via form submission from Orca Network Name: Catherine DrewsDate of Sighting: February 24, 2024Time: 9:20 AMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 7Where seen: South end Holmes HarborDirection of travel : StationaryBehaviors observed: Hunting harbor porpoisesIf orcas, any males?: One large north of group near Honeymoon Bay that was traveling with second orca. This pair was moving moving primarily east-west until hunting group joined.Any unusual markings?: One smaller male has a notch about 1/2 way on the dorsal.Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: No evidence of a kill. We did see the porpoise with the orcas several times.Photos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org -photo by Catherine Drews, February 24, 2024*T36 Flapjack - T137 Loon -IDs by Rachel Haight, Orca Network -photos by Harold Drews, February 24, 2024*Sat, Feb 24 - Puget Sound (T46s & T124Ds) - T46E Thor - T124D3 - T46s and T124Ds traveling together south today. High elevation shots from Sunset Hill Park. Low angle shots from Pier 62. The T46s are kids of T46 Wake, who was captured in 1976 to be sold to marine parks but due to public outcry was released and now has these kids. I always choose Sunset Hill (high hill) over Golden Gardens (sea level) since usually whales are so far out that elevation helps. Today I wish I chose Golden Gardens though because they were so close to shore that these breaching photos were taken between whichever gaps in the trees I could find! Link to more photos. -photos by Hongming Zheng, February 24, 2024*Myself and at least 100 other people were treated to an incredible show from Golden Gardens by the T46s and T124Ds when they hunted down a seal snack and then celebrated their catch! They were SO close to shore, it was amazing to witness!! Don’t turn on your sound unless you want to hear me shrieking in excitement. This was around 12:40, and then they continued down south. Link to more photos. -photos by Abrianna Bell-Towne, February 24, 2024*Male is T46E Thor - Link to more photos. -photos by Douglas V Mercado, February 24, 2024*Our friend Thor and the T46s at Golden Gardens celebrating their kill about 30 yards from shore. They gave about 300 bystanders a great show. Link to more photos. -photos by Josh Nutter, February 24, 2024*On a personal note, in almost 30 years of watching orcas off Golden Gardens I've never seen any this close to shore. Clearly these are transients - it certainly seems there's at least one substantial adult male and other young whales in this grouping. What's amazing about this is that we swim here (off Meadow Point) most days year-round and this water is no deeper than 20 fathoms at its deepest point - but where the whales were on Saturday is perhaps 20 feet tops. I'm not sure what time this video was taken, but the tide midmorning/midafternoon Saturday was somewhere between about five and eight feet at that particular patch of eelgrass. I'm guessing we'll be seeing more of this activity as our harbor seal and sea lion populations increase (we have a good number of male California sea lions hanging out year-round near Ray's Boathouse and the Ballard Locks) but this was still an extraordinary event for the location. Link to video. -Leslie*[It] was pretty amazing seeing Thor (T046E) and his family in Elliott Bay, Seattle. They spent a couple hours along the waterfront and had a meal directly in front of the Space Needle. I felt lucky to see some breaches and spyhops. This video is long but gives you an idea of what the day was like. Link to video. -AirWaterLand Photography*17:40 - Clocked them still southbound, parallel with Three Tree Point but on the Vashon side. -Save the North Pacific Right Whale*17:10 - Viewing from Lincoln Park near ferry dock they’re pretty far out, I’d guess mid channel. Still southbound. Past the ferry lane. -Kendall Spiek*17:04 - They are moving southbound at a very quick clip. We were cruising along side them at about six to seven knots (from plenty of distance away, of course!). Looks like a pod of five with a very large one and four smaller [video in comments]. So cool!16:48 - Here right now [approx. 47.543231, -122.445895]! -Katie Rogers*16:41 - Past south tip of Blake Island, directly across from Emma Schmitz Park. Mid-channel. Moving quickly southbound. -Russ Mann*16:36 - Quick southbound almost to Vashon ferry dock east of mid channel. View from Constellation Park in West Seattle.16:33 - Between Constellation Park and Blake Island southbound east of mid channel.16:32 - From Constellation Park in West Seattle [photo]. -Mary Hartmann*16:29 - By Constellation Park now!! -Brittany Weaver*16:35 - Rounded the point headed south. 16:24 - Moving fast past Alki Beach. -Dan Slagle*16:20 - Possible fins between Duwamish Head and Alki Point, direction uncertain (from Pier 70 via binoculars).15:55 - Seemed like end of foraging to me and Conner from Pier 70 (& there were no calls heard through vessel noise during or after). -Scott Veirs, Orcasound*T46E Thor - 16:04 - Moving southwest off Duwamish Head about 300 yards out. -photos by Mary Hartmann, February 24, 2024*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Briellen CrowleyDate of Sighting: February 24, 2024Time: 4:00 PMSpecies seen: OrcasNumber of animals seen: 3Where seen: Off coast of west SeattleDirection of travel : Towards Queen Anne, slow paceBehaviors observed: TravelingIf orcas, any males?: YesAny unusual markings?: N/AIs there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?:Photos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org*15:50 - Ts have made some progress west, gulls still swirling around above and scooping in. Trend is west still. Now south of east end Elliott Bay Marina just north of ferry traffic lanes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*15:39 - Moving westbound now. -Rose Alita*15:28 - Looking like they made a stop for a quick meal in the middle of the bay.

Still more in north side of bay, north of ferry traffic lanes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network*15:28 - Lots of seabirds and stalling. -Taylor Seyl*15:24 - Just saw them from the Bainbridge ferry!

Have been surface active there.15:20 - Breach under TV towers. -Mary Hartmann*46F Loki - 15:19 - Elliot Bay. -photo by Pilar Hernandez, February 24, 2024*T46F Loki -I’m pretty sure this is that same breach as viewed from West Seattle. It looks like they were definitely a bit closer to you [Pilar] than me at that point. -photo by Steve Rice, February 24, 2024*15:19 - Breach. -photo by AirWaterLand Photography, February 24, 2024*15:19 - By Climate Pledge Arena heading towards grain terminals. -Mary Hartmann*15:12 - All Biggs individuals steady westbound, but one big breach, still tightly grouped, no calls on hydrophone from Pier 70 during last fifteen minutes. -Scott Veirs, Orcasound*15:10 - 15:15 - Ts are still middle Elliott Bay, but have come back west. Loosely grouped with some directional changes but generally westbound now north of ferry traffic lanes.

February 23BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Fri, Feb 23 - Saratoga Passage/Possession Sound (T36, T36Bs & T137s - met with the T46s & T124Ds in late afternoon) - T36B4 & T46E Thor - So grateful to get to see the T36/36Bs, T137s, T46s, T124Ds gathered in front of us on Whidbey Island. They got quite active hunting, and the (presumedly T36B’s) baby was so cute and lively. I have many videos in one of which it looks like the baby joining in the hunt, but these photos for now - I think my favorite is the first photo with T46E Thor’s enormous fin with the baby’s itty bitty fin. From shore with telephoto lens. Link to more photos. -photos by Fusako Nozaka, February 23, 2024BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype)*Fri, Feb 23 - Possession Sound (T36, T36Bs, T46s, T124Ds, T137s) - Link to FB reel. -Fusako Nozaka  *T46E Thor - T36B4 & T137 Loon - Just a few distant shots of the whales as they headed south, out of Possession Sound. These were taken from Whidbey Island at Glendale Beach. Lots of surface action as all five matrilines met up. For a bit, we had a Tparty! Link to more photos. -photos by Cindi Crowder Rausch, February 23, 2024*Although they were super far away from me, but there were super active! -photo by Leo Leo, February 23, 2024*T36B4, T36B Tattertip, T36B2 Greenfelder - T36B1 Bhotia - Between last night and this morning, I didn’t have to go far to find Bigg’s orcas - right in my backyard! Although mostly distant looks, I did see T137 Jack and his family at the north end of Saratoga Passage yesterday (Thurs), still northbound, and this morning the T36s (and possibly others) heading southbound, with the T137s across by Camano Island, and the T36s were closer to Whidbey. Score! Am happy to say I saw the new calf, Tattertip (mom T36B) and her latest - T36B4 - what a treat. -photos by Jill Hein, February 23, 2024*T137A Jack - T137A Jack & T137D Wright - All the whales seemed to be in a hurry that day, so I was mostly focused on keeping up with them rather than taking pictures. I started watching the T137s at Cama Beach and followed them to Camano Island State Park (T36/36Bs were also present much closer to Whidbey). After they passed the state park, I was sitting in my car trying to decide if I should go look for grays and suddenly heard a loud blow. I looked up and CRC56 Stardust was directly in front of me! This was also a short encounter since he moved offshore a few minutes after my first sighting, but it was such a lovely surprise for me to see him a second day in a row. Link to more photos. -photos by Serena Tierra, February 23, 2024*T36B4 in foreground swimming alongside mom T36B Tattertip -photo by Cara Dana, February 23, 2024*17:45 - They’re heading northwest now up Admiralty side of Whidbey.

February 22BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Thu, Feb 22 - Port Susan/Saratoga Passage (T36, T36Bs & T137s) - T137B Tempest & T137D Wright - Fin tip of T36B Tattertip alongside calf T36B4 - Such a beautiful and busy day around Camano Island! I started off watching T36/36Bs and the T137s at Tillicum Beach before heading over to the other side of the island hoping to see a different group of orcas. That group ended up flipping and going south (one of many directional changes), but the 36Bs and 137s looped around Camano Head into Saratoga Passage. As I was watching them, a gray whale approached the beach and started feeding, so I decided to stay with him for a few hours before catching up to the orcas again on the north end of the island in the evening. Big thanks to everyone who contributed sightings and helped keep track of all these whales yesterday, it is greatly appreciated! All pictures taken from shore on Camano. Link to more photos. -photos by Serena Tierra, February 22, 2024*T137 Loon - Fin tip of T36B Tattertip alongside calf T36B4 - Today was just wow! Wasn’t planning on going out today but glad I did. It was magical! Taken in Port Susan off of Camano. T137s and the T36Bs. Link to more photos. -photos by Charvet Drucker, February 22, 2024*T36B Tattertip & T36B4 - T36 Flapjack & T137 Loon - Beautiful day spent with the T124Ds, T137s, T46s and T36 and T36Bs with a new baby born this year. It was SO BRIGHT and sunny made focusing a little harder but what a great PNW day. Link to more photos. -photos by April Janice Basham, February 22, 2024*Calf T36B4 surfacing alongside mom T36B Tattertip - T137A Jack - I got a call yesterday morning asking if I wanted to go see some orca. I enthusiastically answered, "YES!" before they could get the entire invite out of their mouth! There may even have been an expressive expletive in front of that 'yes'. So yesterday was spent with dear friends, 15 orca, and a gray whale. The weather was absolutely spectacular, cool but not too cold, sunny but not blazing, and calm almost no wind. We saw two groups of orca. The first photos were of the T46s (T122, T46E and T46F), T46D was not present. The T124Ds were hanging out with the T46s (T124, T124D1 and '21 baby T124D3). We watched them hunt and consume a harbor porpoise then admired them as they glided along digesting their lunch and exhaling stunning backlit blows. As the T46s and T124Ds turned to travel south, the 137s, T36 and the T36Bs sans T36B3 emerged from Port Susan. As a refresher, T36 (Flapjack) is T137s' (Loon) mom. The T137s are the matriline I researched and got to know quite well. Honestly, you become attached to the whales, but I digress; T36B (Tattertip), Loon's sister (still with me?) had a wee tot about a month ago. I had not had the chance to really see it until yesterday. Y'all, I squealed like a Swiftie at a Taylor Swift concert! That little nugget just blooped along next to their momma as cute as a button! The family was initially together, but split fairly quickly, so lots of spotting at long distances as they traversed Saratoga Passage spread in small pairs and groups. What a fantastic day! I'm so grateful for good friends! Link to more photos. -photos by Cindi Crowder Rausch, February 22, 2024*17:45 - They've continued south, near Race Lagoon.17:14 - Friend reports 137s at least flipped south. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*16:55 - Distant glimpse of two a bit south of Long Point... can't tell direction - long down time, but my first black fins since early December! -Bonnie Gretz*16:28 - The T36s at least are continuing northbound, in line with Crescent Harbor from my perspective.16:10 - Northbound Camano side of midchannel off Camano Island Yacht Club.

February 21SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) - Wed, Feb 21 - Puget Sound (J Pod) - I’ve never captured a spyhop. Let alone two in synchrony. Yesterday [02/21] was beautiful. Congratulations to everyone who got amazing photos yesterday, and to all those who got to see them for the first time. -photo by CT Thompson, February 21, 2024*Wednesday was full of little adventures and the sweetest surprise visit from Jpod. Their visits down to the Island have been predictably unpredictable as of late, and what once was certain months I could count on seeing them, seems to be changing as the years progress. This Island pass was a little different than most, they were very, very spread out and traveled in singles, doubles and small groups all the way down East Passage and beyond. They were mostly offshore a bit, only a few came close-ish in, most of them staying mid channel to each side of. I didn't see too much if any foraging, mainly leisurely but purposeful travel as they spent most of the day circumnavigating the Island. They didn't group up until well into Colvos Passage, where their pass was met with a heavy rain squall and whispy mist that hugged the surface of the sea and snaked through the trees above. About as PNW as it could get! This visit was brief, a one and done. They arrived under the cloak of darkness and left the same way. Regardless of their short stay, it was beautiful as always, and humbled to be in their presence. Hoping their travels brings them plenty of food, and safe spaces to be the wild lovely whales that they are. They are so deserving of our advocacy, every ounce of care, and every action we can give, big or small. More than grateful for every second spent with the wonderful whales of Jpod. They are so cherished and deeply loved. Link to more photos. -photos by Marla Smith, February 21, 2024*J38 Cookie - With only 74 Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales left it's important that we always remember the importance of education and citizen science. The more people that want to be a part of the bigger picture the better. My personal love for these amazing animal is as big as the waters they are swimming in. These beautiful whales travel through Canadian and American waters in search of salmon. We must use our human voices to help protect our Whales and our Salmon. There are many ways to get involved so don't be afraid to ask how, so many of us are willing and ready to point you in the right direction. My hope is the people I'm lucky enough to meet on these adventures gets a spark of interest or inspiration from a picture or story I share and come along beside me for each one that follows. I do believe we can still make a change. March 11th at 11:00 there is a rally in Olympia at the Capitol building for your voice to be heard about breaching the Lower Snake River dams. One BIG change that must happen! Link to more photos. -photos by April Janice Basham, February 21, 2024*A surprise visit from JPod. Viewing from Dune Peninsula. Link to more photos. -photos by Cherie StOurs, February 21, 2024*Here are a few of J Pod. I was at Owen Beach - they were just off Vashon. The photos aren't great as the orcas were far from me, visibility was falling with the rain moving in, and these are cropped, but they are still pretty spectacular to see. Link to more photos. -photos by Alisa Miller, February 21, 2024*J41 Eclipse - ID by Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute - Today with J Pod, from the Tahlequah Ferry to the Southworth ferry... I count every moment I get to spend with these whales as an absolute blessing. If you are able, consider going to the rally on March 11th at 11am at the Olympia capitol building, support the breaching of the Lower Snake River dams! Link to more photos. -photos by Jolena Tagg, February 21, 2024*My second time ever seeing the Southern Residents! Not a close pass, I watched from Dune Peninsula as they passed along Vashon heading west then turned north up Colvos Passage, but was still able to see several spyhops, breaches and tail slapping at the tip of Vashon before they turned northbound! Definitely worth standing in the rain for. Link to more photos. -photos by Jennifer Swenson, February 21, 2024*Viewing J-pod from Dune Peninsula this morning. They were far away, near Quartermaster, but it was so special to be able to see them! -/photos by Lori Cason, February 21, 2024*JPod today entering Commencement Bay in Tacoma. Link to FB video.  -Ryan Dicks*19:09 - 22:58 - Human detections via Orcasound - Listen for Whales app; 23:17 sole detection by OrcaHello AI. Bravo to all the folks who listened last night to the Sunset Bay location. You did a great job annotating the live audio stream and detecting SRKW signals. It's amazing to me that humans are so capable of detecting faint familiar sounds (like calls you've learned) even in lots of noise from the Washington State Ferries and passing trains! Last night your hearing feats are even more impressive since you listened right through the lowest tidal period (21:30) and kept hearing the SRKWs = Southern Resident Killer Whales! Collectively y'all are doing way better than the OrcaHello AI - though it did stay up later listening than most and picked up these clear calls (confirmed by David Bain (after midnight!). -Scott Veirs, Orcasound*21:56 - They’re still audible on the hydrophone. -Jami Cantrell*20:51 - I hear them! -Kristine Stevens*20:36 - Calls on Sunset. -Breanne Denise Ward*17:56 - Straight east from Fay Bainbridge Park.

Really cool as I was just out walking the dog and got a surprise performance! -Stephanie Celt*17:50 - Just after updating J pod loosened up a bit and at least several (all sizes, even little one) woke up and embarked on a wonderful breach fest! They are east of mid channel out from north end Golden Gardens continuing northbound travels.17:44 - Having cell coverage issues. J pod continues northbound travels tightly grouped in resting mode. Shallow surfaces. So beautiful. Due north of my 17:23 update transect Golden Gardens and just south of Fay Bainbridge.

There were more like six or seven and I'm sure one was a big male judging by the size of the dorsal. Also there was a bunch of sea lions I'm the area. There were no eagles or seagulls circling the area which made me think they were Biggs rather than the local fish eating orcas. They were probably after the sea lions. I don't believe there were any herring in the area because of the lack of birds. - JohnTue, Feb 20 - Discovery Bay Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Stephanie MillerDate of Sighting: February 20, 2024Time: 10:39 AMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 5Where seen: Top of Discovery Bay off Cape George across from Diamond PointDirection of travel : S-SWBehaviors observed: millingIf orcas, any males?: noAny unusual markings?:Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: Two small calves with three femalesPhotos available?: No*Tue, Feb 20 - Port Susan/Possession Sound (T36, T36Bs, T137s) - T36B4 in the middle - T137A  - Jack - So exciting to see the baby today - kept missing the close passes but so glad to see orcas back in Port Susan.

The whales were doing a great job at sneaking right under our noses and popping up where we least expected them. Around 15:30, the T36Bs, after not being spotted all day, showed up in front of Tillicum Beach. We got a quick glimpse of the new little baby!

February 19SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) - Mon, Feb 19 - Strait of Georgia (J Pod) - Pleasure to see J19 “Shachi” this afternoon. We spotted a male orca way out in the distance from Galiano Island’s shoreline. We suspected it could be J’s as Comox Valley Wildlife Sightings saw them up their way yesterday. As we scanned we could see several more orcas spread across the Strait of Georgia making their way southeast towards the San Juan Islands. Thank you @brendonbissonnette for ID’ing.  -Salish Sea Orca Squad*BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Mon, Feb 19 - Puget Sound (T36, T36Bs, & T137s) - Absolutely a treat to get to see them all tonight with Kimberly Sylvester! -Leann Mullender*17:50 - Watching from Old Creosote on Bainbridge. The orca have changed direction and are now traveling northeast. -Kimberly Sylvester*17:38 - At least four orcas moving south past entrance of Eagle Harbor, close to Bainbridge side maybe one mile offshore.

February 18BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Sun, Feb 18 - Gulf Islands, BC (T18s, T30Bs, T117Bs) - T30B2 Capella leaping next to T30B1 Vega - T19 Nootka - T30B Lyra with her new calf T30B3 - Not many orca encounters leave us speechless, but today was one of those days! We left the dock with our friends at Maya's Legacy Whale Watching without any whale reports in the area, but you never know what you'll find unless you go out and look. After a couple hours of searching, we found the T18s heading north in the the southern Gulf Islands. Suddenly, they made an abrupt course change and started traveling at speed. Shortly after saying, "They're acting like they're going to meet up with somebody" we spotted more dorsal fins ahead. The T18s came in to join the T30Bs and T117Bs who were in active pursuit of a Steller sea lion. It was incredible to watch the tactics on both sides, with the whales circling wide and taking turns coming in to lunge at and ram the sea lion, and the sea lion spending a lot of time upside down to look for the next attack. Before we left, the sea lion attempted to take refuge behind the boat. The whales fell back, and as we tried to depart the area, the sea lion was keeping pace right alongside us; what was perhaps most amazing was that he showed no apparent injuries at that point despite the beating he had been taking! The action was incredible and the emotions were running high all the way around. Jason will have an epic video of this encounter to share in the week ahead, but for now here are a few still images of one of our most memorable Bigg's encounters of all time.  -Orca Behavior Institute -photos & IDs by Monika Wieland Shields, February 18, 2024*One thing that constantly amazes me about Bigg's killer whales is that calves are always right in the thick of the hunt, regardless of their age. A newborn orca calf weighs about 400 lbs - only 16% of the weight of an adult male Steller sea lion! One wrong move during a hunt and a calf could be seriously injured, but that didn't stop T30B Lyra from having her ~1 month old T30B3 participate in the sea lion pursuit we saw last weekend. One thing I noticed upon going through my photos in detail is that the calf always seemed to be on the outside of mom relative to the sea lion, as you can see in the photo (the sea lion is partially visible in the foreground). Imagine the awareness it takes from the mother to maintain that position during the chaos of the hunt, and the discipline in takes from the calf to stay where it belongs! To my human self, it would seem that the risk of having the calf partake at such a young age would outweigh the benefit of having it participate. It's too small to help in any significant way, and too young to be eating solid food. But clearly killer whales think differently: teach 'em young! -Orca Behavior Institute -photos by Monika Wieland Shields, February 18, 2024*Sea lion hunt with the T18s, T30Bs, and T117Bs. -video by Jason Shields, February 18, 2024*15:33 - Currently docking at Pender Island, BC from Long Harbour, Salt Spring Island. Small pod of orcas viewed from the ferry just off the east coast of Salt Spring, somewhat near Ruckle Park. Two small crafts and one sailboat enjoying the show. Too far away for pictures, but definitely a good male dorsal fin that keeps popping up! Lots of splashing and tail slaps, etc! -Ashley Meadows*Cascadia Region Whale SightingOrca Sighting:Sighting Time: Sun Feb 18 14:47 PSTSighting User Reported Location (Lat/Lon): 48.80908,-123.34160Number Sighted: 3Submitted Comments: Off of Salt Spring Island, Beaver PointSubmitter Name: BrigitteWhale Alert App*Sun, Feb 18 - Victoria, B.C.

They were with a group of twelve to fifteen sea lions. Sea lions were flopping around on the surface and the dolphins were leaping way out of the water.

Young juveniles out front breaching and tall slapping.Photos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org*Cascadia Region Whale SightingUnspecified Sighting: [orcas per Orca Network follow up]Sighting Time: Thu Feb 15 13:05 PSTSighting User Reported Location (Lat/Lon): 48.00870,-122.86172 (Discovery Bay)Number Sighted: 5Submitter Name: PamelaWhale Alert App AND Orca Network follow up: Hi there, thanks for the email. Yes, they did look like orcas with the black fins and tails. They were spraying water in the air. There were two whales ahead, and then it looked like the other three were behind a bit of the rest. The front (two) looked like a juvenile or a bit larger whale. The back three whales had a larger one in it. Hope this helps! I was in shock and awe. -Pamela Allain*GRAY WHALES - Thu, Feb 15 - North Saratoga Passage (CRC56 Stardust) - 21:00 - A quick report now? It's night-time, but I just came in from being outside spending some quality time in the dark with one of our gray pals - 21:00, Mariner’s Cove, southbound. I first heard the puff from inside, so hustled out there to check it out. There is something so magical about a calm, quiet night and hearing a gray just barely off the beach feeding. You can hear the blow followed by the inhale, and gentle (and not-so-gentle) splashing - just so cool! Anyway, I'm going to guess that it's Stardust because of the power of the blow - to me, it seems louder and more forceful than the other grays I've seen, and it's the first thing I've noticed about that particular whale in these last few sightings. Just a guess though since it's dark and I can't see anything. -Marianne Parry*15:00 - Grey whale close to shore going eastbound very close to Utsalady Point Park. -Scot Sebelsky [CWW]*CRC56 Stardust - We had this beautiful visitor today in Oak Harbor, WA (Polnell Point). - photos by Greg & Terra Parham, February 15, 2024*09:51 - [gray] Back here in Polnell Shores.09:40 - [North Saratoga gray] Whale headed southeast from Mariner’s Cove [Whidbey]. -Terra Parham*CRC56 Stardust - 08:45 - This gray seems to like hanging out here for breakfast the past few days. Feeding very leisurely at south end of Mariner’s Cove/Oak Harbor, and slowly heading south toward Polnell. -photo by Marianne Parry, February 15, 2024*08:15 - Good morning!

February 13BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Tue, Feb 13 - Strait of Juan de Fuca (T123s) - Excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter #15: “The animal appeared to be milling so Mark trolled Mike 1 slowly in the direction of it it with hopes of another sighting before all light was lost. With another binocular scan he saw a cow and bull appear within 1/4 nm that appeared to be hunting or prey sharing a likely seal. Mark was able to confirm it was the T123s and watched them finish up their prey before the four of them grouped up and picked up the pace on an eastward track. The brief encounter was ended 11 minutes later at 1811 as they made a line for Enterprise Channel at 8.5 knots with the building flood current behind them.” Read more here at Center for Whale Research Encounter #15.*GRAY WHALES - Tue, Feb 13 - Skagit Bay (CRC2441)15:10 - Last update from me! Upper Skagit gray (we think 2441) has pushed further east, deeper into Skagit Bay. Seems very casual without a care in the world, definitely not on a deadline (basically… a gray whale).14:20 - Upper Skagit gray has flipped back north, Camano side of midchannel, just north of the Maple Grove boat launch.13:37 - This upper Skagit gray is pretty steadily west now, midchannel between Mariner’s Cove and the Maple Grove Boat Launch.1:20 - I think this upper Skagit Bay gray is just one. Still milling in the same general area in between Utsalady & Strawberry Point.12:49 - Another surfacing a little further south, but still pointing north. Not sure if that was a second whale or the original one doing a big loop.12:40 - One gray [CRC2441] in between the red channel marker and Strawberry Point, heading north  -[approx. 48.285720, -122.509964]. -Sara Montour Lewis, Our Wild Puget Sound - CRC2441 -ID by Serena Tierra, Orca Network -back of camera photos by Sara Montour Lewis, February 13, 2024*10:27 - Definitely two whales [CRC56 by Mariner’s Cove].

Appeared mid-channel or further away.  -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*Tue, Feb 13 - North Saratoga Passage (CRC56 Stardust)10:32 - CRC56 has made a direction change. Now headed west/southwest. West of Mariner’s Cove. Last update from me!10:25 - CRC56 is continuing eastbound. Maybe midchannel or slightly Whidbey side. Nearly to out from Mariner’s Cove area.10:15 - CRC56 Stardust spent time feeding halfway between Polnell Point & Mariner’s Cove, but is now pushing south offshore, slightly trend east. Not in a hurry.09:40 - Too far for me for photos, appears to be facing east. Last surfacing still had him eastbound towards Mariner’s Cove. 09:35 - [CRC56] gray close to shore approximately one mile east of Polnell Point. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network - CRC56 Stardust -photos by Rachel Haight, February 13, 2024*Tue, Feb 13 - Saratoga Passage - (CRC53 Little Patch) - I finally caught up with my boy, CRC53 Little Patch, feeding at Hidden Beach at sunset.

The pec was quite distinctive (but no photo) - it has a thick white stripe down the middle area from tip to body, and another on the edge, so it was easy to spot just under the surface as the whale  as feeding. -photo by Marianne Parry, February 12, 2024*Mon, Feb 12 - Saratoga Passage - 15:58 - Gray whale across from Camano Island State Park, closer to Whidbey, headed northbound. -Charvet Drucker*Mon, Feb 12 - Port Susan - 16:05 - Got a gray whale heading south at Tulalip Shores per Port Susan Whale Watch messages. -Sam Wallace
