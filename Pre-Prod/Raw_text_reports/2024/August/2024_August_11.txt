August 9BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) -Fri, Aug 9 - Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage (T65As minus T65A5) - T65A Artemis - T65A Artemis and T65A4 Ellifrit tail slapping with T65A2 Ooxjaa in the middle - We saw the T65As in Saratoga Passage in both the morning and the afternoon. -photos & IDs by Kyla Bivens, August 9, 2024*T65A6 Callisto, T65A Artemis, T65A4 Ellifrit - T65A3 Amir - T65As in Saratoga Passage. -photos by Bonnie Gretz, August 9, 2024*T65A3 Amir - I took off to see if I could catch the T65As pass Sandy Point. T65A, T65A4, and T65A6 were mid channel, and T65A2 was closer to Camano, but T65A3, Amir decided to hang out on the Whidbey side. I thought these two pictures might give you an idea of what shooting with a 600 mm long lens can do. The shot with the pier in the picture was shot at 180mm. The close up is the next time he surfaced zoomed in to 600 mm then cropped. My point in this is to help people understand distances. You can't tell how close we are to whales, and with the compression our lenses create, you can't tell how close boats are. Thank you for the visit, Amir. -photos & ID by Cindi Crowder Rausch, August 9, 2024﻿*Serena Tierra thanks for pointing these out to me today on the bluff. Made my weekend and was so magical.
