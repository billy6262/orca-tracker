July 21BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) -Sun, Jul 21 - Haro Strait (T46s) - T46D Strider - Check out the water surging over the leading edge of the dorsal fin of T46D Strider in Plumper Sound! The T46s made their first confirmed visit to the Salish Sea since March. They were photographed in Chatham Strait in southeast Alaska on July 3rd, over 700 miles north of the central Salish Sea, so they've covered a lot of water in the last 2 weeks! After losing their iconic matriarch T46 Wake last spring, it's been awesome to see these four siblings continue to stick together. Sometimes the loss of a mother prompts a family split or dispersal, but it seems that T122 Centeki, without any offspring of her own, has perhaps taken on the maternal role for her three younger brothers. -Orca Behavior Institute -photo & ID by Monika Wieland Shields, July 21, 2024*16:48 - They are past Stuart Island still going northbound.
