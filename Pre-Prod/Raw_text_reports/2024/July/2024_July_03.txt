At first they were very spread and doing long dives, and no sooner had I explained to our intern Kelsey that this often precedes a hunt than the action erupted at the surface. Due to the activity level of the whales we at first thought they were on a harbor porpoise, but it turned out to be a harbor seal that had caught their attention. Adult orcas can often grab a seal with ease, but this appeared to be training time for the youngsters. The adults kept the seal corralled while the littler whales took their shots at it. It was not a good night to be a harbor seal but it was spectacular to watch. We aren't sure who struck the killing blow, but the whales started prey sharing just as it was time for us to depart.

July 16BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) -Tue, Jul 16 - Deception Pass - For the record: these whales did go east under the bridge in Deception Pass; they didn't stay too long and flipped back west, exited the pass, then headed north in Rosario Strait.*We saw two small-ish orca whales sneak through Deception Pass completely unnoticed by the whale watch boats. It was like watching a jailbreak. -Cape Grayson [ONCG]*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: David AndersonDate of Sighting: July 16, 2024Time: 1:25 PMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 2Where seen: 48.39370° N, 122.66446° W (Rosario Beach)Direction of travel : WBehaviors observed: Milling, spyhopIf orcas, any males?: UnknownAny unusual markings?: NoIs there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: One juvenile based on apparent size of dorsal finPhotos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org -photo by David Anderson, July 16, 2024*Tue, Jul 16 - San Juans20:12 - A group of three to four are headed to Reuben Tarte right now. -Ross Jackson [WSSJI]*18:55 - Pod of four just left Echo Bay… Swam through the harbor! -Ricarda Burnett*Tue, Jul 16 - South Puget Sound (T35As & T38As) - Link to more photos. -photos by T.J.

I am viewing from land, Grapeview side of Pickering Passage. -Cammy Malm LaRiviere*08:30 - Same area [Pickering Passage]. -Steven Venetta*07:45 - 08:00 - I work for DOH, sampling oysters for Vibro and while sampling at a site I encountered four orcas in Pickering Passage!

He was actually decently close at that point - like maybe 30 feet from me. -Jami Cantrell

More fun than seeing the whales was the excitement from passengers. An older gentleman asked what I was looking at as I stood on bow of boat and I said orcas. He said he’s lived here all his life and never seen a whale. I told him where to look and we saw a double breach. It never gets old watching people watch whales doing their wild thing. -Debbie Stewart*11:32 - Talking to staff member Rachel who is seeing who looks to be T46Bs, T75/T75A approaching Clinton ferry dock, just north of it, close in to the Whidbey side.

Neighbor just shared her friend was in Fish Trap Loop and saw them. They have passed through Dana Passage and were off of Harstine Island. I got her message at 15:55. -Joan Ahre*16:09 - I can confirm (from someone else's video) that they went up through Dana Passage. No telling if they went back into Case Inlet or hung a right and headed toward Nisqually Reach and those parts.15:00 - They exited Eld Inlet and swung over to the entrance to Budd. Stuck around there for a brief stint and are now heading north - passing Boston Harbor very close to shore. They were really close to shore (across from me) when they passed by Boston Harbor heading north out of Budd Inlet. DEEP DIVES. But from that trajectory, they were more likely to go up Dana Passage with Harstine Island on their left. But I totally missed them going by me this morning as they headed south into Eld. First sighting for me of them was at 14:15 as they turned around and were heading north. As they exited north out of Eld and before they crossed over to sniff the entrance to Budd Inlet. They are passing the spit of Cooper Point. Budd Inlet is behind that sand bar. I have no idea who these are and how many. I think five. At least one male [video in FB comments]. -Kim Merriman*14:18 - This was today in Eld Inlet. -photo by Elizabeth Wittgow-Styles, July 15, 2024﻿*13:44 - Geoduck divers in Eld Inlet reporting a group that appear to be hunting.

I could see them milling by the point but view obstructed by neighbor's landscaping. Not sure if they headed to Case Inlet or Olympia. -Joan Ahre*07:15 - Four to five orcas seen off southern tip Anderson Island this morning. -Erik Willis*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Erik WillisDate of Sighting: July 15, 2024Time: 7:10 AMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 5Where seen: Southern tip of Anderson IslandDirection of travel : SE then turned around and headed NWBehaviors observed: HuntingIf orcas, any males?: YesAny unusual markings?:Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?:Photos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org*HUMPBACK WHALES -Mon, Jul 15 - Puget Sound - 17:00 - I saw him [humpback] off of Saltwater Park in Richmond Beach. -Barb White

July 14BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Sun, Jul 14 - Haro Strait (T109A2s) - T109A2s. They’ve been in that area all day. -John Boyd [WSSJI]*21:00 - I believe this group was last seen crossing the border eastbound towards Henry Island.

Link to clip. -Fred Horn [WSSJI]*Sun, Jul 14 - San Juans19:10 - Looks like they are now headed down channel.19:02 - Milling - no direction.

They were super far away in Port Susan, but we had a good time watching them anyway. As they traveled north, they covered a lot of ground. They were practically sprinting through the water. We dashed to the next beach and just like that, gone. We waited for over an hour to see them again and they just vanished. After leaving and making it back home, we heard the whales had turned south and exited Port Susan. We were surprised that 13 whales snuck out right under our noses!

So warning for a few pictures... beautiful, crazy active, tail slaps, breaches... incredible lighting... total of about 21 orcas today!   -photos by Bonnie Gretz, July 13, 2024*20:00 - At Bird Rocks with Island Adventures Whale Watching.

We watched as a huge pod of Bigg’s killer whales made their way south in Admiralty Inlet. We spent a good deal of time with these whales. Around the end of our encounter, we decided it was time to leave. We departed from the whales and made our way back to the harbor. However, in the corner of my eye, I spotted the whales again. They were right in front of us! As if to say goodbye in the best way possible, these whales popped up right underneath the boat! All engines were shut off. There will be a video that follows soon. What made it special was the fact that it was just our boat that experienced this unexpected treat! Everyone else was so much further away! This encounter left me with lifelong memories. Link to more photos. This video captures one of the most spectacular moments of my entire life. We were departing the scene, leaving all the whale watch boats behind, when I suddenly spotted the whales right off our bow! All engines were shut off right away. We drifted in the current as the huge group went right under our boat! I was ready to cry. This moment is so special to me, as no one else really saw what happened. We were far from everyone else. It was such a crazy turn of events and it’ll live with me forever. Link to FB video. -photos by Kat Martin, July 13, 2024*Beginning out in Juan de Fuca and moving into Admiralty. There are two videos at the end as well. Link to more photos. A little video from [the] super pod before they entered Admiralty and split into multiple groups. Link to video. -photos by Charvet Drucker, July 13, 2024*T75A Stone - Sort of speechless about what a wonderful day this turned out to be! At the VERY last minute I decided to get on Island Adventures whale watching… made it to the dock with 15 minutes to spare… reports of 30-40 Bigg's incoming. The morning grouping had split apart a bit, and headed south toward Port Townsend. We caught up with some at Point Wilson and got a lovely pass across our bow. Overall we had the T49As (minus A1 and A2)...matriarch is Nan (b.1986) and kids Nat, Neptune, Nebula, and Charlie II; T75 Kidney (b. 1971) and her big son, T75A Stone (b. 1991) - rare sightings of these two in the Salish Sea; and the T46Bs with matriarch T46B Raksha (b. 1988), daughter T46B2 Akela and her calf T46B2B (b.11/23), plus 46B3 Sedna, 46B4 Quiver, 46B6 Sol (these are sister and cousins to the T46B1s I saw last week), and T75C Bam Bam (b. 1998) and her kids 75C3 and 75C4 (b. 2021 and 2023). This group is also new to me. We stayed with them as far south as Lagoon Point but on the Kitsap side to mid-channel of Admiralty Strait, then reluctantly had to head back to Anacortes.  -photos by Bonnie Gretz, July 13, 2024*Saturday was beyond amazing and truly a day I will never forget. We were out with The Salish Sea School in the Salmon Banks area I believe. There were 40 killer whales - T034s, T035s, T036As, T037s, T038s, T046Bs, T049As, T049C, T075 and T075A matrilines we were told!

This will be my last report as we leave the scene. They appear to be aimed towards the south end of Marrowstone Island (Admiralty side) rather than the Hadlock cut [approx. 47.961908, -122.675073]. -Bart Rulon Art & Photography*16:32 - They’re headed north at Basalt Point. -Rebecca Carpenter*16:24 - Update.

Fowler*15:39 - In Port Ludlow Bay. No direction yet. Eating a meal [approx. 47.941571, -122.675175]. -Bart Rulon Art & Photography*13:00 - Orcas are definitely over by Basalt Point where the San Juan Clipper is on the map below. Still holding a southbound travel. Slowly. May even be heading into the Hood Canal simply because of how west they are [approx. 47.964473, -122.673454]. -Kevin Phillips*11:28 - Viewing from Bush Point lighthouse now… heading south very close to Marrowstone shore. Saratoga on-site. -Nikki Clarke*11:14 - T46Bs are southbound closer to the Marrowstone side [approx. 48.043614, -122.660402]. -Bart Rulon Art & Photography*11:10 - About midchannel headed south just north of Bush Point. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*10:54 - Still southbound [approx. 48.070629, -122.625759].10:22 - 46Bs southbound here [approx. 48.100329, -122.643658]. -Kyla Bivens, PSE*10:24 - T46Bs inbound southbound from north Marrowstone. -Bart Rulon, PSE*Fri, Jul 12 - Hood Canal (Probable T37A1 & T65As minus T65A5)21:26 - Taken just south of Lofall (near Aldo Road) and still milling around until a few minutes ago. -photo by Benjamin Sy, July 12, 2024﻿*21:28 - North of Bangor base. Right in between Bangor and Lofall.21:12 - There are three just playing south of Lofall. They don't appear to be heading in any particular direction. They are circling heading north just really really slowly. -Jan-John West*20:11 - We see at least three mid channel just north of Bangor heading north.

Two females, a large male, and a baby. -Kaitlyn Milliken*13:15 - I just saw four or possibly five traveling north just north of Eagle Creek! -Laura Straight*11:12 - Southbound, mid channel just passing rest a while (Sund Rock).10:19 - Approximately quarter mile north of Dewatto, east side, circling.09:48 - I can see three? (Edit: three large and one small spout) spouting on the east side, probably across from Eagle Creek. It [is] a bit choppy, with whitecaps, hard to see, about three miles from me. Still southbound. -Steve Illman*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Debbie BatesDate of Sighting: July 12, 2024Time: 9:28 AMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 3Where seen: 400 yards south of Ayock pointDirection of travel : S cruisingBehaviors observed: TravelingIf orcas, any males?: NoAny unusual markings?: NoIs there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?:Photos available?: No*HUMPBACK WHALES -Fri, Jul 12 - Puget Sound (BCX1251 Orion) - 19:00 - Humpback whale Orion is circling around at my map spot [approx. 47.838917, -122.444609 (off Eglon)]. -Bart Rulon Art & Photography*18:55 - Humpback whale ‘Orion’ near this pin [approx. 47.831468, -122.462968]. -Kyla Bivens, PSE*18:49 - Blows still visible just north of the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes, Kingston side of mid-channel. -Megan Stuart Chapin*14:50 - Just saw a couple blows north of the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes, closer to Kitsap side. They were fairly far [north of the ferry lanes] but I swear I could see a dorsal from the ferry. I lost them as I raced toward the bow to get outside with my camera. As we were approaching Kingston I saw a couple blows look up toward Possession Triangle area [between Edmonds/Kingston/south Whidbey], didn’t see any dorsals and the blows seemed tall for killer whales? -Amy K. Fowler*GRAY WHALES -Fri, Jul 12 - Central Puget Sound - 16:30 - Literally were five feet from me at one point. At Owen Beach/Point Defiance [video shows gray whale]. -Carrie Lanphear*08:40 - I think this is what we saw [July 12] just off of Devil's Head! The two points [fluke] we saw as it went down had us stumped! It's making more sense now. -Shannon Boldt
