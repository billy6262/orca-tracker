Jpod in Active Pass filmed from Bellhouse Provincial Park, Galiano Island BC. -video by Salish Sea Orca Squad, July 23, 2024*BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) -Tue, Jul 23 - Deception Pass (T109A2s) - T109A2A Seekah on left - Today we saw one of my favorite orca pods from shore. The T109A2s made a bit of an impromptu appearance in my day. With no report to go off of, only marine traffic, I headed out in my search for whales. I caught up with them as they passed under the Deception Pass bridge and watched while they massaged themselves and played in the kelp around Strawberry Island for nearly 45 minutes to an hour. They slowly made their way east where they played and hunted some more before finally making their way to Ala Spit around 19:30 - 20:00. Link to more photos. -photos by Kat Martin, July 23, 2024*19:20 - Showing hunting behaviors, back and forth from mid channel Ala Spit to Skagit Island. -Kevin Phillips*18:40 - They look like they may be hunting east of Skagit Island [approx. 48.415662, -122.574283]. I’m viewing from Dewey Beach. -Brandy Jackson Ritchie*17:51 - Still seeing distant blows off Yokeko Point, they’re slowly heading east.

Whale watching boats with them, no IDs. -Amy Smith Norris *14:30 - Sounds like they're still milling and killing outside Aleck Bay.11:30 - Group of Bigg's killer whales heading west from Aleck Bay, Lopez Island. Assuming they continue, they could be visible from Cattle Point sometime early afternoon. -Orca Behavior Institute [WSSJI]*Tue, Jul 23 - Saratoga Passage/Possession Sound (T34s, T37, T37Bs) 19:22 - Passed by Summerland [previously had been northbound] mid channel. -Stephanie Griffee [CWW]*16:15 - They were heading southbound, and crossed past Sandy Point across towards Hat Island. One male, one female, and a tight group of three to four and one looked small: we were 800 yds away and slowed to idle to let them decide which way they were going then slipped past. No good pics, too far away.  -Steve Marczewski*16:13 - Just passed Sandy Point heading east. They are in Possession Sound now. -Luanne Seymour*15:59 - Watching in Langley. About three.

My GF sighted and thinking orca but sounds like it’s probably this guy [referring to BCX1251 Orion who was seen in the vicinity hours prior]. -Josh Nutter*UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES -Tue, Jul 23 - Central Puget Sound 20:00 - My wife and I live at Point Ruston. We happened to look out and saw a single large [orca?] only about 50-70 feet off shore right in front of the Ruston apartments/condominiums. Moving slowly, heading north toward Dunes Point, we only saw it surface twice, then disappear! We scanned the water for the next fifteen minutes or more looking from the Port of Tacoma all the way to Dunes Point, Vashon to Browns Point, and never saw it surface again. [Follow up:] I am actually not confident at all! I do know it didn’t have the big dorsal fin like the transient orcas have… we saw two of them heading north a couple of months ago and the dorsal fins were so prominent. Also now that I think about it, this mammal seemed lighter in color than an orrca would. It only partially surfaced twice while we were watching. My guess would be that it was 12’ to 15’ long, kind of the size of a large orca. It was a mystery to us how it just disappeared too, because both my wife and I were scanning the water for 15 minutes from our balcony on our fifth floor apartment. -Art Nicklaus
