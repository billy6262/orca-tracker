July 8BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) -Mon, Jul 8 - San Juan Islands (T46B1s) - T46B1 Tread - Out on Island Adventures Whale Watching with Jill Hein… we went all the way up to Patos Island to catch up with the T46B1s, consisting of T46B1 Tread (b. 2003 and the grand-daughter of the beloved and prolific matriarch T46 Wake… she escaped capture and has at least 20 descendants… we lost her in 2023), her daughter T46B1A Tsakani (b. 2015) and son T46B1C (b. 2022). Tread is the mother of T46B1B Tl'uk, the grayish calf who was born in 2018 but only lived until 2021. The sun was shining, the water was mostly glass after our initial sightings in some bumpy tides where they were feeding. As we watched from a distance, with the engines completely off, they suddenly popped up right next to us! Tread had remnants of dinner in her mouth! They crossed our bow and circled around again, then headed north into Canada. Beautiful sparkling light, gorgeous whales… a sweet summer evening on our magnificent Salish Sea! -photos by Bonnie Gretz, July 8, 2024*T46B1 Tread - Aboard IE5 with Bonnie Gretz, we headed northwest by Sucia and Patos Islands and found the T046B1s (46B1, 46B1A and 46B1C) foraging in the turbulent currents. They surprised us by surfacing a few feet from the boat - wow - too close for most photo lens pointing in their direction, but what a nice dilemma! Tread, the matriarch, had evidence of their shared meal. -photos by Jill Hein, July 8, 2024*Mon, Jul 8 - Admiralty Inlet (T75 & T75A) - T75A Stone - Spent the day whale watching with Puget Sound Express, we came across T75 and her son. Located near Smith Island. The crew mentioned these two are rarely in this area, so we were blessed. Link to more photos. -photos by Tamra Brennan, July 8, 2024*09:20 - Two orcas, a male and female pair, were spotted headed north just south of the Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry lanes. They continued quickly north/northwest, ending up by Victoria in the afternoon. They were identified as T75 & T75A. It's very possible the initial report was this pair, since it was reported as two with one larger than the other and reported as traveling north. -Rachel Haight, Orca Network*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Lynn Smith-WilcoxDate of Sighting: July 08, 2024Time: 6:30 AMSpecies seen: Black with large fin on the backNumber of animals seen: 2Where seen: The mouth of Hood Canal right before it goes into Admiralty Inlet.

The whale sightings network in Washington State is really quite impressive and I’m thankful everyone shares their sightings in real time so we knew exactly where to go to wait for the whales. Link to more photos. -photos by Emma Luck, July 7, 2024*A long hot day of following the T99s and T36's up Saratoga Passage from Hidden Beach, up to Long Point, where, but porpoised out to share in the meal by the green marker. Then they all eventually went back into Penn Cove, and I made the right decision to go down to the mussel rafts at the west end of the Cove. Three or four were right at the base of the bluff, and were hunting a seal. They then slowly made their way back out… what a treat! Those T99s really seem to like Whidbey and Camano Islands! Nice to see lots of fellow orca-holics!   -photos by Bonnie Gretz, July 7, 2024*The T99s and T36/36Bs made their way north in Saratoga Passage, by my house and on into Penn Cove. Spectacular weather, and fun to see some of these good looking and very healthy whales feasting their way to the smorgasbord - the Penn Cove mussel rafts. Harbor seals tend to haul out on the rafts at times, uh oh, not always a good choice. -photo by Jill Hein, July 7, 2024*T36 Flapjack - T99C Barakat - A few shots of the T36, T36B & T99 friends as they made their way north in Saratoga Passage this afternoon.

I think all were grouped earlier, eight to ten, but only seeing five now. It looked like 99, 99D, 99E together hugging shore, T99C more mid, and then what looked like T36 but can't confirm, in-between those. I'm fairly certain I saw the really little earlier and more whales before the split just before Pebble Beach. So unsure where others are.10:25 - Now continuing northbound along Whidbey shore maybe 200-400 yards out, likely near Langley. So funny how quickly & suddenly they crossed over!10:19 - They are now Whidbey side headed straight towards Langley, directionally west/southwest of where they had been.10:14 - Direction change - now pushing straight off Camano, just south of Pebble Beach.10:05 - Approx. location [48.057143, -122.377814] northbound, loosely grouped.

I've asked him to send you more videos. He thinks there may have been eight to ten individuals present. I drove down there and saw them from shore, about half a mile out, just south of the buoy at Van Damme: 39°15'49"N 123°48'01"W. When I saw them they were just milling around, rolling, lunging and occasionally jumping - we saw several full breaches. Then the fog rolled in and we lost sight of them. They were too far away from us for photos. I'll be really interested to know if the pod can be identified. Hoping the videos have enough information for that. This is only the second time in 25 years I have seen orca off Mendocino. -Tim Bray -Mendocino Coast Audubon SocietySun, Jul 7 - California Coast (CA201s AKA T355s)[Update with IDs:] Very cool encounter! These look like the Bigg's killer whale matriline, CA201s (aka T355s), Liney's matriline; there are likely seven whales in that group.
