Entry 5:
the group included a days-old calf!

Entry 6:
J16s and a wandering J53

Entry 7:
The calf was travelling particularly close to J16, but as J16 is now over 50 years old and did not appear pregnant during aerial encounters in October, we are skeptical that she is the mother.

it did not leave J16’s side throughout CWR’s observation today

On December 26, NOAA researchers photographed a days-old calf traveling with J-Pod in Puget Sound.

J60 was traveling with J16 Slick, a 51 year-old post-reproductive female. J40 was present in a different group

Entry 13:
The calf with J16 was confirmed to be J60

Entry 14:
So who is J60's mom?

Entry 15:
it seems unlikely J40 or J16 is J60's mother
