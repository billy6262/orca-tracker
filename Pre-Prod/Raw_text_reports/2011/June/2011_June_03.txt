Orca Sightings for June 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30 am: 5 Orca
in Whale Pass by Sutil Channel from a boat, possibly commercial, over the radio. The tours tried to locate these whales, but only found Dalls Porpoises.

On the

2:30 Kingston to Edmonds
Ferry I observed 3 breaches of what appeared to be a juvenile
Humpback
. It was traveling east to west toward Kingston. I thought Minke for a while, but when it breached, the flippers looked too big. Any confirmations?

The clear, sunny day brought out the normally elusive harbor porpoise...and Mt. Rainier! The massive volcano, which is over a hundred miles away, was in the backdrop of as we headed through
Cattle Pass
. There we saw a
minke
whale, harbor seals, steller sea lions and many harbor porpoises. Once in the Strait of Juan de Fuca we sighted at least
two other minke whales
alongside many birds. Near Spieden Island a juvenile bald eagle ate a decaying seal while many others were in the top of trees or soaring above.
