Orca Sightings for June 14, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
heading from
Whidbey Island
toward the south end of
Lopez
, about

1:15pm
. We watched J-Pod with L-53 Lulu and L-87 Onyx, spread out in 4 groups, with J-2 Granny in the lead again! Looked like newest calf J-47 in the next group. Interesting that J-26 Mike and J-27 Blackberry were in the last group again, with L-53, and the NOAA vessel following, trying to deploy the suction attached short term D-tags. Again, this last group of Orcas dipped into Cattle Pass slowed down, showing how strong they are against the huge currents, with tail fluke slaps, a few breaches, and spy hops. A male also showed "pink floyd", so mating with L-53 going on? As we headed up Cattle Pass at about 3pm, the whales increased their speed around Goose Island and Cattle Point to catch up with the rest of the clan off South Beach.

12:50 pm
: a large
Humpback Whale
was seen between
Quadra and Vancouver Islands
by Race Point. It was doing longer dives as it headed Northward against the current. It's always a great surprise when they breach, and this one did a couple of times. By

4:30 pm
it was only by Maude Island, so not very far, and still doing long dives.

off of Gibson Point heading North towards the Tacoma Narrows bridge.

Newport OR
.

J pod
swam past

today for a whole hour starting at

8:15 pm
, heading north.

At

3:30 PM
, part of
J-Pod
was passing
Lime Kiln Point State Park
heading north. About 15 minutes later, they turned around and headed back south. Several whales, including
J19 Shachi, J41 Eclipse, J40 Suttles, and L53 Lulu
thrilled visitors by coming right into the cove next to the lighthouse. I also was able to identify J8 Spieden and L87 Onyx well offshore. The whales continued south, where they foraged in the currents off of Land Bank until about
5:30. Word was that the rest of J-Pod was still further south in Haro Strait.

We headed south toward
S. Rosario
in search of
J-pod
. We saw lots of Harbor Porpoise in SJ Channel on the way. By the time we arrived on scene the whales had turned West and were traveling along the south end of Lopez. They were spread out but in nice tight groups of 3 to 6 whales. We spotted L53, J19 & J41 traveling together at first. Then L53 hooked up with J8 (Spieden est. 78 yrs) and J2 (Granny est. 100 yrs )for some Speed Swimming (see JB's photo below). Pretty amazing to see the powerful energy of these 2 senior ladies! We paralleled different groups of whales at 200+ yards to Cattle Pass. We had nice encounters with J17, J35 and their calves J44 & J47. Watched L87 for awhile, and then saw a group of approximately 8 whales including J27 and J26 get pushed into Cattle Pass by the huge flood tide. By the time they crossed from Lopez to San Juan they were north of Goose Island. At one point the whales were swimming south, but moving north. Eventually they got in the lee of Goose Island and made their way back out and around Cattle Point.

4 to
4:30 pm: 6 Pacific White Sided Dolphins and a few Dall's Porpoises
around the Stuart Island area. Aaron,

Whale Watching from Susan MacKay, Whales & Dolphins of BC:
*
2 pm: 4 Dall's Porpoises
including one all greyish in colour that may be a Hybrid Dall's/Harbour Porpoise cross were seen zipping about by Churchhouse in Calm Channel.

12:30 pm
: One or two
Dall's Porpoises
close to Quadra Island in
Discovery Pass
. Radio reception was broken, but I believe it was reported by Aaron and Jen of Campbell River Whale Watching from Susan MacKay,
Powell River
Whales & Dolphins of BC
*
Jpod
met us just north of
Deception Pass
. They were widely spread out, several close to shore and some way out in the strait, heading toward the North Whidbey shoreline. After our stop in Friday Harbor, we found them again a little ways north of Minor Island, heading north. J2 Granny and J8 Speiden were together at the head of the pack; the whole group was very spread out until someone did a bunch of tail lobbing (Granny? But I couldn't tell for sure) and then they grouped up. In addition to Granny and Speiden, from passenger photos I was able to identify
J14 Samish, J16 Slick, J19 Shachi, J 26 Mike, J27 Blackberry, J36 Alki, J40 Suttles, and L87 Onyx
.

J pod
go past

We met the first of
J-pod
at South Beach and watched as they hauled north toward
Eagle Point
, with some porpoising at the fast pace. On our way back toward Friday Harbor the rest of the pod came into view as we approached Cattle Point. This lagging group was full of youngsters and moving in a tighter formation, but slower pace. There were two mature males present that I believe were Blackberry (J-27) and Mike (J-26). The newest additions to the pod appeared to be practicing their lob tails, repeating the action shortly after their elders would do so. Afterwards they took turns breaching, with one member coming completely out of the water three consecutive times!

A
J pod

1:30pm
: We had a very spread-out group of
orcas
stream past us this afternoon heading west past Flint Beach, headed toward Iceberg Point (
Lopez Island
, WA). They were traveling well off shore. It took about a half hour for the whole group to pass by.

Erick Pierson called at

11:53 am
with
J's
and possibly some
L's
, in Rosario Strait headed south, some only 1/4 mile from shore but spread out over about 5 miles, almost to
Partridge Pt., Whidbey Island
. At

12:12 pm
Granny made a hard turn NW toward Haro Strait, did a few tail lobs, and the rest of the pod followed and turned as well, so looks like they may be heading back up to San Juan Island (unless they change directions again soon).
*
We had
at least five Orcas
from about
11-12 AM
this morning traveling South along the West side of
Whidbey Island
by the Naval Air Station, Ault Field; complete with Whale Watching boats from Friday Harbor and Anacortes. There was also a mother and child pair straggling about a mile or two behind the main group as well. Lots of breeching and blowing and merriment for us watching!
