Orca

Holly, Pebble Beach

4 killer whales
(probably transients) from
Ozette
area, N 48 09.85 W 124 45.23. They were just off the shore from Cape Alava, swimming very close into the beach and circled a couple times towards Ozette Island and towards Cannonball (and around our boat!). There were at least 19 harbor seals in the area, half hauled out and half in the water. We did not see any attacks or feeding activity but did catch a couple of good taillobs!

Our adventures today started off a little cool, cloudy and choppy as we traveled south towards Cattle Pass. Around the bend, headed northwest into the
Haro Strait
, we began seeing intermittent identifiable black dorsal fins: looks like
J-pod
was in the neighborhood. The pod was spread out over a half mile with about ten individuals in pairs and singles. Some of the animals were even breaching! Another whale watching vessel identified one of the leaders as
J2, "Granny,"
leading the whales south but potentially changing the pod's direction to go north again.
