At

9:15 pm
a
gray whale
swam in from the northwest and started feeding NW of
Langley
on Whidbey. I've been watching it in the dusk and listening to it rigorously feed in the shallow water with lots of splashing. It is now

10:20
and I can still hear the whale feeding!

Tonight Simon and I have been listening to what sounds like a large, single
GRAY WHALE
feeding in the shallow waters along Langley's shoreline parallel to First St, specifically at the bottom of Park Avenue. It sounds exactly like Veronica von Allworden's description from last night. Tonight's visit began about

9:30pm
and lasted about 20-30 minutes. The whale's breathing sounded vigorous and healthy, and exactly as it does when we've heard them feed in previous years.
