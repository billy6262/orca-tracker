Orca Sightings for June 28, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Way out at
South Pender Island
, we found
J27 and J34, with J34
doing lots of tail lobbing. Closer to the shore we spotted
J28 with J46
, with several other whales, too far distant to make ID's. It appeared they were heading towards Active Pass. 'twas a beautiful calm day out there, the sun even came out for a while. Interestingly, although the tide was fairly low, we didn't see any harbor seals hauled out at any of the usual places, that's a first for me.

3 pm:
It took the whale watching tours quite a while to find them, but they did. Around
15 Transient Orca
that looked like they were in two distinct groups, one group of around 7 whales joined together by Sentry Shoal,
mid Georgia Strait
below Savary Island. They were on a kill when spotted. There were at least a couple of calves in the mix. The orca apparently didn't move much and were milling about with no direction he left them in between S. End of Hernando and Mitlenatch. Also, did you hear about the dolphins that were found stranded on the mud flats in Oyster Bay also rumouur has it that there were Orca South Bound in front of CR at about 6am?

I was out there at the same time again today (

3:30 p.m.
) and the (
Humpback
) whale was also there, though kind of far out. Saw it surface perhaps three times. I have not had any whale spottings before yesterday, but am surprised by how I can hear the sound of the blowing, even though there is quite a lot of other sound from waves, and it is quite far away. several times I heard it but did not see the whale, it is a most distinctive sound.

8 am:
report of
4 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
stranded on the muddy shores of Oyster Bay, South of
Campbell River
.
Garry, Aboriginal Journeys Stranded Pacific White Sided Dolphins, Oyster Bay, BC
Early this morning four Pacific White Sided Dolphins were very close in to shore by Oyster Bay, South of
Campbell River
, feeding on some small fish. When the tide went out, they became stranded on the muddy beaches. This is very unusual for these highly intelligent mammals to find themselves in this sort of predicament without good reason. Once the call went out, there were around 50 people that responded to help get these Dolphins back to deeper water. Putting them on tarps, one by one, they were carried across the mud flats and released into deeper water. They swam away apparently OK. There is talk that the possible reason for this Dolphin stranding is due to their being chased by Transient Orca. Over the past number of weeks, there have been marauding groups of Transient Orca in this area.

We had another great day today with
J's and K's
in
Swanson Channel
, through Active Pass and into the Strait of Georgia. Active Pass lived up to it's name as the whales were breaching, tail slapping and pec slapping through it.

The gigantic dorsal fins of
Blackberry (J-27) and Double Stuf (J-34)
sliced through the water as we rounded Mouat Point of
North Pender Island
. The two males appeared to be feeding when they would pause from their northward travel pattern to circle one another as they powerfully taillob the surface. Double Stuf, in his early stages of maturity at the age of 13, still bears a curved and skinnier dorsal from youth. A group of four orcas, which consisted of a very small individual, hugged the coastline as they surfaced in unison while heading towards Port Washington.

OrcaSound
Neah Bay hydrophone
reports: -

3:17 pm
: I'm not sure, but I think I've been hearing extremely faint whistles at Neah Bay for the past 5 minutes or so.
Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA
The auto-detector also picked them up (whistles on Neah Bay hydrophone). Sounds like they could be killer whales to me.
Scott Veirs, OrcaSound/Beam Reach, Seattle, WA
It sounded like killer whales to me. I am probably a little late on this. Possibly L pod.

We were on aerial surveys today and saw
killer whales
off of Point of the Arches. Pat Gearin was on the water and also saw killer whales off of
Ozette Island
heading north earlier in the day. Likely he saw the same whales we saw from the air. Pat reported seeing a group of 5-7. We will have to look at photos to determine which group these whales belong to.
