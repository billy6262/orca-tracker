Orca Sightings for June 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went south to
Salmon Bank
at about 1pm, and really enjoyed watching
2 to 4 Minke Whales
, until about
2pm
, in calm, slack water. Steller Sea Lions, California Sea Lions, and Harbor Seals sun-warming on Whale Rocks.
Harbor Porpoise
in San Juan Channel, and a variety of marine birds and Bald Eagles on Long Island and Whale Rocks! I say 2 to 4 Minkes, as they were "slinky", diving and surfacing in their typical, unpredictable pattern, so not sure if we saw the same whale!

Perfectly calm waters and a crescent moon, then that thrilling WOOOSH about 30 yards from our deck- closer than ever- about
midnight
tonight upon returning from Krishna Das in Seattle. A single
gray whale
. What better chant than this! Judyth Reichenberg,
Langley
, Whidbey Island, WA

We have not had many
gray whales
feeding in front of
Langley
this "gray whale" season. But from

10:30 Pm to
11:45 PM
I listened to a whale breathing and splashing as it fed for over an hour NW of Langley on Whidbey Island. Today there were lines of feeding pits quite close to the bluff.

Humpback whale
(ID BCY0324 aka "Mama) feeding south of
Victoria
. She has been seen feeding in the area since Friday
June 3. She was the first humpback whale that I catalogued in 1999 near Race Rocks. She has since brought at least 2 calves to the area, last year her most recent.

Dan Ducic called from Salt Point, near Stewards Point, in
Sonoma County CA
, to report seeing three whales he believed to be
orcas
, at
10 AM
this morning. He said they were 20-30 feet long, with tall dorsal fins, but he thought he saw white tips on the dorsals. He said they were about 100 yards from shore, "playing" and moving gradually northward.

5:30am gray
south bound past
Langley
.

Nicole Abeln posted on our Facebook page the photo below of two
Minkes
, taken at
Salmon Bank
.

Once through the pass we cruised straight out toward
salmon bank
. A
minke whale
surfaced next to an aggregation of birds, undoubtedly stealing away a portion of their hard earned fish. We watched as the sleek, stealthy animal surfaced a few more times and then slid below the surface. We observed a second minke surface about a half a mile further out. They changed direction with every dive and were constantly on the move.
