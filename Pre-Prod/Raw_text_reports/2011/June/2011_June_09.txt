Amazing night out on the water with the
J's
!!! We had them all to ourselves, and they surrounded us on all sides of the boat, just continuous breaches, cartwheels, tail-lobs, everything! the calves breaching too, it was amazing! breaches right next to the boat!! oh wow, what a night!

Noticing some sailboats clustering in
Shilshole Bay
(N of Seattle, WA) about

6:30 tonight
, our daughter spotted a dorsal fin using our spotting scope. My wife and I also watched the orca, appearing to be a small female or youngster, for a period of time. Definitely too big for Dall's porpoise, and had the shape of a female dorsal fin. Since there was only one orca fin visible, we wonder whether this may not have been a
transient
, which might have been attracted by our considerable colony of sea lions. Another craft in the immediate area appeared to be a monitoring vessel. More orcas to come, we hope!

We headed out on our 10am tour and made our way towards
Constance Bank
after receiving a report of
a lone Male Orca
being seen in that area at
8.30am
by one of the local fishing charters. Then we received a report that
T20 & T21
had been sighted north of Beaumont Shoals, so off we headed in that direction. As we arrived on scene just off Lime Kiln we witnessed the two Transient Orcas make a kill, their prey this time being a Harbor Porpoise. We sat for several minutes as the T20 & T21 devoured the Porpoise between them and then headed off towards Kelp Reef!

My matie Mike reported seeing a
humpback
twice off of
Useless Bay
this afternoon (around

16:30
).

Just south of
Constance Bank
our Captain (Trev) stopped the boat and used his binoculars to scour the area and spotted a
Humpback Whale
5 miles South East of Constance Bank heading west. We followed the Humpback for a while as it continued to travel west.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to say he was on the NOAA Research boat today, and they were with
J pod
part of the day. J pod was up off Pt. Roberts in the morning, then at Monarch Head around 1 or 2, then off San Juan Island again this evening. He had identified
J14, 16, 22, and 27
.
*
We had
J pod
a couple miles north of East Point in the
Strait of Georgia
. They were a big spread, but tons of breaching everywhere you looked.

Another great day with
J pod
in the same area we had them yesterday (~7 miles from
Deer Harbor
, Orcas Island). I also just heard there are "many whales inbound at Otter Point". Translation: the return of maybe K and L pod. Exciting trip coming up tomorrow to see who's back.
Deer Harbor Charters, Orcas Island, WA
*
J pod
was present and playful today! We first saw the orcas at Saturna Island's
East Point
as both juveniles and adults took turns breaching, lob tailing and spy hopping as they slowly made their way east. Two mature males were in the lead for some time, which we believe to be the pod-mates Blackberry (J-27) and Mike (J-26).

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales had heard reports of a few
Transients
around the Salish Sea today, but no further details so far.

I just went out to look for the reported Northern Lights show and was, instead, gifted with the unmistakable sound of a feeding
Gray
just below the bluff (
Saratoga Passage
, near East Pt/Baby Island)!!
