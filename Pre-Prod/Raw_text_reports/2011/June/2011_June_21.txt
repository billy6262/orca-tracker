I just heard that
J pod
was heading west at
Beaumont Shoals
at
2057
, so the calls you heard (at

8:54 pm
, Lime Kiln) were probably them. They did not come as far north as Bellevue Point tonight.

Came across
6-10 Orcas
at about two this afternoon near Iceberg point (
SW Lopez Island, WA
). They were heading west. There was one adult male with the rest being females and juveniles.

When heard about whales back at the mouth of the Fraser river! We turned around and eventually found part of K pod near the river mouth (
K34, K27, K25, K20
and a few others). I mostly took ID shots today but here are a couple of them and one spyhop.

J11's, J17's and J22s
is who we had for 32 minutes off
Whidbey
. Also had reports of
J2, J8, L53
off iceberg later in the day too.

Slick J16
and her daughter
Echo J42
simultaneously did an inverted tail slap today at
Salmon Bank
around
4 this afternoon
as they headed north.
Melisa Pinnow

Out visiting
J-Pod
yesterday near
Lopez Island
. Samish, Riptide and Tse-Yi'-Chn swam together for a time but then became pretty active (breaching, porpoising and some tail lobs).

J-Pod Orcas
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
, heading northwest from Whidbey and Smith Island toward Lopez and Salmon Bank with calm, flooding tide. At

2:50pm
, I noticed J-34 DoubleStuf by himself, and many small groups really spread out. One whale breached closer to South Beach, then many whales breached all over the place! I lost count of how many breached! A calf stuck its little head up as though trying to spy hop! Some tail lobs and whales rolling around showed active behaviors! The groups came closer together as they reached Salmon Bank, slowed down swimming toward Eagle Cove, as they often do. The sun reflected off their backs, and we give them lots of room when they are spread out like that, so hard to identify. We enjoyed watching all the active behaviors until about

4:15pm
and were able to ID that last group; J-16 Slick with her daughters J-36 Alki & J-42 cute little Echo, and my personal favorite- her son J-26 Mike.

6 pm
: During a quick scan of the waters in front of
Powell River
, the distinctive dorsals and splashes of around
60 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
foraging back and forth in front of the Mill got me to grab gear and head down to the skiff. The sun shining and calm waters was an extra bonus. The Dolphins were only interested in feeding, chasing fish close in to the Willingdon Beach shore. I stayed with them till around
9:20 pm when they suddenly exploded out of the water and made a B-line back towards the Mill then continued towards Lund. It was interesting to also see some terns picking off some of the excess feed.

Orca Network received a call today from Phyllis Sines, reporting
3 groups of orcas off the WA Coast
:
1) 47 24, 124 31 - 2 + orcas at
10:29 am
2) 47 30, 124 34 - 1 orca
3) 47 58, 124 47 - 3 - 4 orcas
They also saw 1 baleen whale with throat pleats - didn't see large pec fins, said the throat was a lighter color & pinkish, and it had a "blunt" nose.
*
A few
calls
were heard on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
at

8:54 pm
by myself & several others, then they stopped - but it would be a good time to tune into both Lime Kiln & OrcaSound hydrophones!

2:45 pm
: South end of
Lopez
, going east to west
4 or 5 orcas
close to shore, then 4-6 more including a large male. Whale boats out in the distance in the Straits.

It was over 25 miles this morning to see
Orcas
today, almost to
Partridge Point
, the NW side of
Whidbey
, but we made it. A group of
Js
. Later on we left most of J Pod at South Beach headed up island toward Lime Kiln.
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island, WA
*
Heading south out of Friday Harbor we headed further south towards
Smith Island
we encountered a pod of fast traveling
orcas
. This pod of killer whales (believed to be a mix of J and K pod) had everyone's attention as they displayed an array of exciting behaviors! A rambunctious younger member of the group was the first to breach! As the pod spread further apart they became even more active with several members of the group breaching, spyhopping, and kicking. At one point we even had a simultaneous breach from two of the pod members!

Barbara Bennett of the Island Co./WSU Beach Watchers reporting seeing whale spouts & several boats with the
orcas
, near Ebey's Landing,
West Whidbey Island
, at around

12:40 pm
. It appeared the whales were moving closer to the Pt. Townsend side of the inlet a bit later.
*

11:00 a.m
.-ish: saw about
8-10 whales
due west of Libbey Beach on
Whidbey Island
in Puget Sound feeding near three small fishing boats. Two had very long fins. Using the binoculars, my neighbor said she also saw a baby whale in the group, pinkish in color, but I myself did not see it. They were traveling more-or-less southwest.

On this first day of summer, about

9:15 AM
we just spotted multiple
orca
whales 200 yards or so from shore heading South down the Straits. We are in the Nor'wester building at
NAS Whidbey Island
. At least 15-20 whales from the count we tried to do. One was breeching and "dancing" for us; to our delight! Is it perhaps J pod again as it was last week?

Orcas
heading south at Sandy Point,
Ferndale, near Bellingham

I live on
West Beach
near
oak harbor, Whidbey Island
- a whole pod of
orca whales
passed in front of the house at

10:48 AM
and there was about 8-10 and 2 were very actively jumping completely out of the water.
Vance Jorgenson, Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island, WA

Orca Network received a report from Joe Williams of Olympia, WA, just in off a fishing boat off the WA Coast:
6 - 10 orcas N. of Wesport, near Ocean Shores
, ~4 miles off the coast, heading SW around
noon
today. The pod included at least 1 adult male, and 1 female with what appeared to be several calves/juveniles.
*
6 transient orcas
( 1 adult bull, 1 calf and 4 females/juveniles) off Cow Bay, Flores Island just NW of
Tofino
at

16:00
. No one manged any ID's as we gave them a very respectful distance. Our evening trip was spent in their company off Whaler Island (!!) closer towards Tofino. We left them at
20:00 as they formed a resting line with their direction set up Miller Channel.

Our trip back to
Tofino
on the offshore discovered a feeding
gray whale
in Ahous Bay and then a traveling
humpback
1 mile offshore Lennard Lighthouse. Hat-trick of whales!
