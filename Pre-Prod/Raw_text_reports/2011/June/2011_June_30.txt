Orca Sightings for June 30, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a report from a fisherman at
9am [orcas]
at St. Vincents Bight eastbound. I spoke with a fishing vessel at 1130am when I got to Kelsey bay and he said they were at St. Vincent. Around 10 am: 3+ Orca were spotted at St. Vincent's Bight close to Kelsey Bay, lower Johnstone Strait by the same unknown commercial vessel.

I then came across a group of about
50 white sides
(Dolphins - SM) very spread out foraging in
Johnstone Strait
mid passage across from Yorke Island by the time I left they were turned to the west following a sailboat.

Riptide J30 doing a back dive in
Rosario Strait
around
3
, he later did tail waves, pec slaps, a cartwheel and a belly flop, photo taken aboard the Odyssey. A female from J pod was swimming on her side today in Rosario Strait around 3, all of J pod was VERY active with atleast 5 cartwheels, 6 breaches, 2 spy hops, 2 lunges and countless tail waves, tail slaps, rolling, pec slaps and back dives!

Today we left the harbor and went up over Lopez and out into
Rosario Strait
. We were nearly to Anacortes, just outside of Burrows Bay, when we saw a massive dorsal fin slice through the water. There were a couple of smaller fins in the vicinity and as we drew closer there was a huge explosion of water as an orca breached clear and landed on its side. Another breach followed shortly after and we noticed that there were whales very close to the rock. They were moving fast, changing direction a lot and finally our suspicions were confirmed when one of the whales surfaced, on its back, with a salmon in its mouth. We were able to identify Blackberry of J pod and Onyx (L-87). The whales gradually moved around the corner, deeper into the bay. We followed L-87 all by himself to the south and then rounded the corner to meet up with the whales in the bay. There were spyhops and then more spyhops, a few breaches, and lots of tail slapping. One younger individual swam on its back and tail slapped for a good 5 minutes straight. We prepared to leave 3 or 4 times but couldn't tear ourselves away from the activity. It was the largest display of surface behavior I have seen all season.

Bottom end of
Rosario
near Davidson rock. Mostly
J's
but we did see
K20
in the mix as well. We had breaches and spyhops, it was a great show and we got to go back home through the bottom end of Orcas Island, which was gorgeous! Took us 7 hours round trip but we all enjoyed every minute of it.

12:35pm:
We have an
orca
parade, with tour boat escorts, headed west-to-east off of Flint Beach on the south end of
Lopez Island

Between

7:30 and
8:00 AM
we saw
orcas
from Land Bank's Westside Preserve on the west side of
San Juan Island
. There were easily 30+ whales, so presumably it was J-Pod with the few K and L Pod whales that have been traveling with them. The whales were in a large resting group that was impressive to watch even though they were well offshore in the middle of Haro Strait. They were facing north, but making little progress against the flood tide.

Noon: Thanks to the tip a few minutes ago, I'm hearing some faint
Killer Whale calls at Neah Bay
(on OrcaSound hydrophones).
Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA

6:58 am
: Group of about
4 transients
(with no large male dorsals) were observed inside the
Neah Bay
breakwater. No kills were observed and no auto-detections of killer whale sounds were recorded.
Jon Scordino, Biologist, Makah Tribe, Neah Bay, WA

At

7:00am
, there was a report of
4 killer whales
inside the Neah Bay jetty! We were unable to get any pictures or resight them but hopefully they will stick around in the area.
