Orca Sightings for June 13, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb and Gale Richard met up with members of
J Pod, L87, and L53
in front of the Center for Whale Research (48 37.48 N, 123 12.46 W) on Shachi. Shortly after Erin Heydenreich, Candice Calloway-Whiting, and Candice Smith had a follow up encounter on Orca. The second encounter began at

12:48 PM
and followed
J Pod, and L53
. The whales were spread out and traveling at a medium speed. The encounter ended at

4:56 PM
off the west coast of Stuart Island (48 40.15 N, 123 13.78 W).

Off of Deadman Bay, in
Haro Strait
, a school group of kids, (and all the grown ups!) were thrilled to see
J-Pod Orcas
. Another strong flooding tide and the whales spread out in 4 active groups, with J-2 Granny in the lead. From about

1:45 to 3 pm
, as they headed north, the Orcas also breached, spy hopped, tail fluke slapped the surface, and some made direction changes as though fishing. J-27 Blackberry and J-26 Mike were together. They are now the eldest males in J-Pod, at 20 years old.

9:45 am:
A lone
Humpback Whale
was Southbound at
Race Point
. It was first thought to be a Gray Whale, but later confirmed it was a large Humpback. At
11:30 am it was around Duncan Bay, Discovery Passage.

Word was whales were headed north... no, wait... south... no, wait... north! A pod of indecisive
orcas
! Yes, northbound for sure along the west side of
San Juan Island
. As we rounded the northernmost point of San Juan Island, one by one, we saw large black dorsal fins belonging to none other than, you guessed it,
J-pod
! They were still in the neighborhood and we were able to catch up with them as they traveled towards Canadian waters. We found the rear ten to fifteen individuals of the 27-animal pod and observed them as they tail slapped, pectoral fin slapped and upside down tail slapped. One of the pod members even spy-hopped four times, each time nearly revealing pectoral fins. When a whale of any species does this maneuver--bringing its head and often even eyes up out of the water as it remains vertically positioned--it is considered a curious behavior. This leads scientists and whale watchers alike to consider: are the whales curiously watching us?

I was out with Island Adventures today. We caught up with
J Pod
at about
Lime Kiln
, heading north. We left them at Kellett Bluff. They were resting in three groups - with Granny in the lead. Hurray! The conditions were amazing - warm sun, flat water. So, the sight of the whales surfacing and breathing together was extra spectacular. We saw an occasional breach, spy hop and tail lob. But, mostly, they appeared to be resting. Ken B (Center for Whale Research) was in the middle of things and I expect he got some really great photos. Can't wait to see them. We also saw lots and lots of harbor porpoise in Guemes Channel and a few Dall's Porpoise as we approached the whales at Lime Kiln. Beautiful day on the water!

Over the weekend we were able to get some photos of a
common dolphin
that has been sighted off
Boston Harbor lighthouse
, near Olympia since 5 June. Upon comparing these photos to photos sent to us a week ago, we found that they were different animals. This is consistent with one early report of 2 dolphins, and the more recent reports of 1. It is possible that the missing dolphin did not make it, so please be on the alert for reports of unusual stranded animal in the south sound.
