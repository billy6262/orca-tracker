Orca Sightings for June 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:37am
: Board Chair Mike Dougherty just reported
a lone killer whale
that came no less than 10m from the dock in Rolfe Cove on
Matia Island
. It was so quiet they could hear it vocalizing underwater!

~11am
, we saw
8 Orca
heading west at a steady pace between Protection Island and Diamond Point. The group included one Male and one small calf.
Sue Thomas, Wildlife Biologist, Washington Maritime NWRC
We are pretty sure this is the same pod photographed off Sequim by Jay Cline that was in the Sequim Gazette. Dave Ellifrit of the
Center for Whale Research believes the male orca is Transient orca
T75A
.
*
Possible Entangled
Humpback
in
Puget Sound
- We have had no further word or sightings of this whale - if you see it, call Cascadia Research at 1-800-747-7329 immediately. Boaters, please keep your distance and notify Cascadia if you see the whale. If you live in the Dalco passage area, you can assist in looking for this whale from shore as well.

We observed what we believe to be a
humpback whale
at the tip of
Kitsap Peninsula
, close to shore, right off the tip of
Hansville
, between Skunk bay and Norwegian Point, Hansville from

9:30 pm to
10:15 pm
. It was loudly spouting and we were inside our house and could hear him so we went outside to the water's edge and watched it for 20 min. It had a small dorsal fin. There may have been two but no more than that.

Brian Owen of Tacoma shared a 2nd hand report of a large whale (likely the
Humpback
) several hundred yards off Owen Beach,
Pt. Defiance
at
8 am
.

Jay Cline of the Sequim Gazette posted some photos of
Orcas
near Port Williams near
Sequim Bay
, WA on Facebook.

~
7:30 pm
: I am at south beach (
SW San Juan Island
, WA) right now and am seeing a few whale watching boats with more then 10
orcas
, they are heading north slowly, doing lots of tail slaps, a few breaches and direction changes.

We headed southeast over the top of
Lopez Island
and down the east side, we moved out from under the cloud and into the sunshine. Guess who was waiting for us in the sunshine?
Orcas
. Resident orcas. Lots of them. We found them in Rosario Strait. They were spread from the near side of the channel all the way across toward Whidbey Island. It was tricky to get a good ID as they weren't coming up too far out of the water, but our best guess from the partial saddles that we got was at least some of J pod with a possible few K's and maybe even an L or two mixed in. Shortly after our arrival there was a bit of splashing and we did get to see a little guy breach a couple of times off in the distance. There was one tight group that stuck together the whole time we were there that included one big male and a couple of ladies as well as a juvenile and a calf.

We saw a group of
Orcas
today from the beach about

3:40 pm
west off
Deception island
moving into the straits in the direction of South Lopez Island. They were moving at a fairly fast pace and spread out in open water. At least one whale watching boat was following them at a respectable distance. After looking out over the water so many times over the years we finally saw a pod of orcas here.

We had a pod of
eight orcas
in the
Santa Barbara Channel
on our Island Trip today. Got excellent ID photos, which will be sent to Alisa.

We came across the same pod of
4 killer whales
that we saw yesterday, in relatively the same area just outside
Moss Landing (Monterey Bay, CA)
. First they were heading west towards the harbor and were being a little elusive so we hung back. Then, they turned east and became extremely playful (see photo below). The young whale in the group breached dozens of times and it looked like the adults were getting frisky-- and our suspicions were confirmed when we saw Tony Thomas' photo! This pod was so interesting because of how active and playful they were-- usually the transients we see will be social for such a short period of time after they kill something then continue foraging, but these guys didn't quit the entire time we were with them-- same as yesterday. They seemed truly happy.

10 am
: The same (although I didn't receive the photos to confirm IDs - SM) two
Humpack Whales
from yesterday were spotted again in Discovery Passage close to Brown's Bay, B.C.

10:20 am
: Around
20 to 30 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
slowly and steadily cruised past Westview,
Powell River
headed towards Grief Point. I was disappointed not to see them leaping, but the water was so calm, they're always a pleasure to see.

10 am
: Around
20 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
just above Discovery Passage closer to Okisollo Channel,
Powell River
.
