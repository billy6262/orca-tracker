Orca Sightings for June 15, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we encountered
5 Transient Killer Whales
. I have rarely seen both residents and transients in the same area, ignoring each other, but I wonder if they do have a cosmic agreement in sharing the range? Ironic that so often, when the residents are out of range, then here come the transients! The transients are much less frequent, so harder to identify individuals. T-65A with a calf, juvenile, and 2 others off of
Wasp Passage
at about

12:30pm
. I noticed at least 1, maybe 2, had what appeared to me to be an open saddle patch; dark pigment going into the lighter patch. I wonder if anyone else saw and/or photographed that. I mention this, as a distinction of Transients was a closed saddle patch- no dark pigment, solid light patch on all of them. The whales headed west into
San Juan Channel
, staying closer to Orcas Island, although erratic surfacings after long dives in the pass, then they seemed to be hunting in the channel with circling, arching dives, and youngster tail flukes in the air! At 3pm they were still in San Juan Channel closer to Spieden Island.

Saw ladies - 3 adults and 1 calf - about 30 minutes outside of
Friday Harbor
this
morning
. We were so excited! We were told they were transients (due to the small grouping of only 4) and heard rumors later that they were the T-65's I think.

Caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye at

10:35 am
so quickly grabbed the binoculars just in time to see another blow and the half body porpoising move that's quite typical of a
Minke Whale
on the move. And then it was gone. Minke's are quite notorious for a few quick breaths then disappear for long periods to pop up quite a distance off. This one seemed to be on the move Northward just off Westview,
Powell River
.

Heading north in
Rosario Strait
we saw a
dolphin
by
Burrows Island, south Puget Sound
, heading west. I only saw it surface once but it came almost all the way out of the water and was definitely a dolphin, not a porpoise; not sure what kind but it looked kind of brownish. Maybe the lone common dolphin that was in Olympia a while back?

Mark from the fishing vessel "Greater Pacific" called this
afternoon
to report he saw
5 orcas
, 1 male, 2 females, 1 calf & 1 juvenile, in
Monterey Bay
. At first they were .5 mile out heading toward the Monterey Bay Harbor breakwall. Then turned to the shallow water and kelp line, headed past the Monterey Bay Aquarium, then toward the outer Bay red buoy at Pt. Pinos.

MONTEREY, Calif. - Keith Stemler, 47, of Monterey, was on a boat in
Monterey Harbor
, Wednesday, when
three gorgeous killer whales
swam by. Stemler was returning to the harbor after going on a salmon fishing trip with Chris' Fishing and Whale Watching. Suddenly, the pod of Orca whales surfaced just 15 feet away from the boat. Stemler grabbed his camera and caught the action. "When I first spotted the Orcas I thought, 'Holy smokes, I scuba dive there,'" Stemler said. "I have seen Orcas many times in their natural environment. I have never seen them so close to the wharf area and San Carlos Beach."

We had
four transient orca
(categorized as the T-65A's) come through
Deer Harbor, Orcas Island
right when we were pulling out of the marina. They came through a narrow passage called Pole Pass at low tide slack water. Today's low tide was one of the lowest tides of the year. Not only that but timing their transit of the pass when there was not any current running is a marvel of navigation. The current runs up to three to five knots through there on a normal tide. On today's tide it would be considerably stronger.

It's not great news when you hear that there are
Orcas
way west of
Victoria
going west. Could it have been J Pod, who were heard the evening before going North past SJI?
Transient Orcas
near
Yellow Island
, by Friday Harbor. And then another phone call!
Another group of five Transient Orcas
, the T75s, over near Sidney, BC, coming our way. We chose the pod near Sidney, and then with only one other boat, watched them glide lazily down Sidney Ch. toward D'Arcy Island. It was an incredibly beautiful evening.

Flat, calm, no wind, beautiful lighting, and thanks to the hockey game we were the only boat sitting off of
Sidney Island
with a pod of
5 transient orcas
.`There was one big male, one calf, one other juvenile and a couple of larger adults (at least one was a mom). They were swimming south, taking five minute dives, with long surface intervals when their behavior changed drastically. They dove and then surfaced inshore of where they were, disrupting a noisy, congregating group of birds. They milled at the surface for a few minutes and then turned and went back past us to where they originally were and proceeded to spend the next 40 minutes or so just milling. There was lots of rolling around at the surface, diving sideways, and at one point one of the adult females lifted the calf out of the water on her nose. We watched, stunned, with the engines off as the pod swam in circles, brushing up against one another, porpoising and rolling. Then two of the whales split away from the circle and things got a little bit strange. It was as if someone had just sped up the merry-go-round. The circling behavior continued, but more aggressively, with splashing, and speedy dives. Finally I figured out what was going on. A little harbor seal surfaced in the midst of the chaos. I was expecting a quick kill followed by a pool of blood, but instead the whales continued to circle the poor little seal for the next 10 minutes. He frantically looked up, then down, then back up as the whales continued to toy with him. The calf was apparently getting a little hunting lesson as he mimicked the adults behaviors to the tee. Finally we had to break away and head for home. It was tough to leave and we continued to watch for as long as we could as we pulled away. We saw the little guy breach and then they were out of sight. It was a beautiful evening with amazing whales.

8:22 am
: We've been watching what appears to be an adult and a juvenile
gray whale
about a mile NorthEast of
Point No Point
(N. Kitsap Peninsula, WA). They are headed North. Long deep dives followed by the younger whale doing a half breach/half tail slap several times.

I believe I saw a whale of some sort around the coasts of University Place, WA (SE of Tacoma, on the
Tacoma Narrows
) at around

21:34
. Really cool, and just wanted to tell you guys. (very likely the Humpback reported below - ON)

8:50 am
: A ferry worker told a friend of mine that a
humpback
whale is being seen on the Tahlequah/Point Defiance ferry run at the south end of
Vashon Island
.

Latest sighting of the
south Puget Sound Common Dolphin
comes from Jennifer Rodriguez of
Olympia
, she observed the long-beaked common dolphin @

11:30 AM
off Burfoot State Park Beach. The dolphin moved back and forth, and could have been feeding.
