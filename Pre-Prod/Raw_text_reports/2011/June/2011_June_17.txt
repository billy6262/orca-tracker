Orca Sightings for June 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit and Astrid van Ginneken of the Center for Whale Research began an encounter with Transient orcas at

12:35 p.m.
3/4 of a mile west of
Blunden Island
(48 45.19 N, 123 10.80 W).
T123, T123A, and T123B
were traveling south at a medium speed. At

3:00 p.m
. the T123's were tight and traveling southwest at a medium speed. The encounter ended at
3:13 p.m. at 48 43.74 N,123 12.42 W.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research went out on Shachi and found the
T10's and T26's
. There was a follow up encounter that began at

12:27 p.m.
in Cordova Channel off the south tip of James Island (48 34.11 N, 123 21.10 W). Dave Ellifrit and Astrid van Ginneken followed
T10, T10B, T10C, T26, and T26A
up to the north end of
James Island
. The whales were tight and traveling slow. The encounter ended off Sydney BC (48 39.33 , 123 22.92 W) at

1:55pm
.

Russ xxx reported lots of whales coming east through
Race Passage
at
1630
, traveling fast (7 knots) with the incoming tide in rough seas. Ken Balcomb and Mark Malleson responded in r/v "Shachi" at 1730 and encountered
J, K, and L pod subgroups
spread from about
Trial Island
to Seabird Point on Discovery Island (48 24.51N, 123 12.28W). The lead group included mostly K pod members, and subgroups of L pod followed, with J pod bringing up the rear and traveling most northward as the armada of whales swam toward the west side of
San Juan Island
and False Bay. By the time they reached SJI, the whales were spread from about Eagle Point to Lime Kiln lighthouse, and some were catching salmon that were visible in their mouth, though regrettably the seas were too rough and dark to find scales for species identification. The fish in the mouth of Lxx was large enough to only be a Chinook, and we presume that was the species being hunted by the others. Before the light faded, Mark was able to get a photograph of the
new baby in L pod, L118
with its mother that Ken had barely photographed in February in Monterey Bay, California. The whales apparently spent the night foraging off the west side of San Juan Island, and on the morning ebb tide the J and L subgroups headed west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Ferry workers report a
humpback
whale blowing and splashing sporadically to the west of the ferry lane to over by
Pt Defiance
(the point). Spotted
every day this week

Along with
transient killer whales
, we also had the chance to see a
humpback
whale at
Constance Bank

Today we got spoiled: we had a choice between two
transient killer whale pods
! The first group was called in as located off
Sidney Island
on the Canadian side of the Haro straight; a second pod was seen between
Saturna and South Pender Islands
. Once we caught up with this second group, we found that there were three animals in the pod: one male, one female and one calf. Even with lots of helpful eyes on the water, references to our transient catalog and chats with other vessels, we were not able to positively identify this pod. They showed some splashing and direction changes and then began heading west along South Pender Island.

Canadian Salish Sea waters today, by
Sydney and the D'Arcy Islands
! Another group of
4 Transient Killer Whales
using the strong flooding tide, heading north, at about

1:45pm
. They were swimming slowly in a fairly tight group, taking long dives, and like the ones yesterday, I wonder if they were resting a bit, letting that tide move them along? We indentified
T-10
with her son T-10A, and youngster T-10C. We also identified T-26, but I did not see her 21 year old T-26A, who was sighted the day before with this group.

We found
two Transient orcas
less than a mile outside
Moss Landing CA
today. They were porpoising out of the water probably chasing after something-- there were
bottlenose dolphins
just off the beach as well as some sea lions in the area. On our way in from our trip, I spotted them again, this time about 2.5 miles from the harbor entrance. These are the same two killer whales we had on
May 6th who had hunted together and killed a harbor porpoise-- both days it was just these two with no others in sight. They surfaced just a few feet from our boat.

6:38 p.m
. Echolocation too now.
7:13 p.m. The calls are getting clearer now. J pod is there!
7:22 p.m. I'm not sure, because I've never heard them before, but (from the Salish Sea sound tutor) it sounds like K pod is there too.
7:37 p.m. They seem to be swimming north. Some calls on Orcasound now.
8:09 p.m.

Just got back from the west side of San Juan Island - we caught a few of the whales as they passed by but missed others that had already passed the light. The whales were in classic CWR "Groups Spread Out" formation spread from a few hundred meters offshore to mid-Haro Strait. Whales and (groups) seen included (
K20, K38, K25, K27
), ...(
J17, J28, presumably J46 and J47
), (J27 plus presumed J31 and J39), and what was probably the J22s and J32. All of these whales headed north past
Lime Kiln
. Approximately 15 minutes later the K12s stalled out in front of the lighthouse. K22 and K33 milled and spyhopped around some kelp mats and K33 did a few tail lobs and pec slaps. K12, K37 and presumably K43 did similar social family stuff in their own little group and eventually they all joined up and headed south. We waited for the rest to cruise back south but by 2135 we didn't see anyone coming back from Bellevue.
