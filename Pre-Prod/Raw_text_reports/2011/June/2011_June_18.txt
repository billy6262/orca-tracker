Orca Sightings for June 18, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
They were a mile or so south of
Race Rocks
by
1000AM
, and out by
Port Renfrew
by
mid-afternoon
.
J pod and a few stragglers from K and L pods
remained spread out in interior waters.
Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, WA

While traveling up the coast in a 40 ft sailing vessel we spotted a pod of
Orcas
apparently feeding. It was rough choppy waters, so we could not see what exactly they were eating. But their behavior was a darting back and forth through the water in one area as we went by - they were not migrating. There were
at least 6
, maybe more, and one orca that had a very prominent dorsal which was much larger than the others, I presume to be a male. Approximate location was about
200 yards off Cape Mendocino
.

A lone
humpback
whale was observed mid
Colvos Passage
off of Point Richmond Beach today at approximately

5:15pm.
The whale was headed south then turned and went north. I did see a tail fluke during a dive. I did observe spouting.

headed Southward at a no nonsense pace past Westview,
Powell River
.

Hearing some
whistles
on the
Pt. Townsend hydrophones
at

9:45 pm
. Meg McDonald also reported faint whistles on the PT hps at

9:26 pm
. They sounded a bit more like dolphin calls than orcas, but never heard enough to confirm this.

As we rounded
Cattle Point
and came up along the west side (
San Juan Isl
) in some choppy waves, we were rewarded for our perseverance:
J-pod
was back from their few-day stint at sea. Spread out in a long line along the west coast, we watched the orcas travel in their smaller groups past Lime Kiln State Park. One orca out on its own (Blackberry?) ceased hugging the coast and traveled out among the various whale watching vessels, breaching twice before continuing his meanderings.

I live just east of
Eagle Point
, and around

12:30pm
today as these
orcas
were heading up the coast. I wasn't sure whether one of them was a juvenile, and thus might be of interest!
