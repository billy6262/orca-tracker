Orca Sightings for June 12, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
While hiking on a beautiful sunny day, around
Cattle Point
Lighthouse around
1 pm
, surprise! Three tight groups of
Orcas
are heading past Lopez toward South Beach. The first 2 groups swam past pretty fast, but the 3rd group dipped into Cattle Pass. The NOAA research vessel, trying to deploy D-tags was right with them. We were able to identify J-27 Blackberry, J-34 DoubleStuf, J-16 Slick with youngster J-42 Echo. I thought they would probably head up
Haro Strait
with the flooding tide, and sure enough we saw them on the west side and traveling north past Lime Kiln Point State Park! Two hours of great views from San Juan Island!

I got a report of
2 dolphins
, sighted between Woodard Bay and
Harstine Island, south Puget Sound
from Linda Almadino. Sounds like we may have a few dolphins in our waters.

Today on both of our trips, we encountered
J-pod
. First off of the west side of
San Juan Island
where they were headed northeast and then off of East point, the most northwestern point of the United States, and headed into Canadian waters. Our whales went international today, visiting a few countries along the way. Within the pod, we were able to identify Mike (J26). With Mike, we found his mother J16 (Slick); she has a little stripe of white coming off her saddle patch towards her dorsal fin making her somewhat recognizable. Two other animals were with this sub-group, possibly Slick's children Echo and Alki. Bringing up the rear of J-pod was Blackberry (J27). And with him were about five to six other orcas, potentially his family. And following behind Blackberry and crew were... humans A research group with NOAA was out tagging whales again, trying to understand what the whale hear and the sounds in their environment.

Group of kayakers paddling from James Island to Washington Park
Rosario Strait; orca pod
seen approximately Â½ mile west of Green Point, by Washington Park. GPS coordinates for where we rafted up were: N48.29.957 W122.43.235. We were watching one male(?) traveling close to the shore. After he moved out of sight we started again for Washington Park. Another whale surprised us be surfacing close to the kayaks. We rafted together and watched as several small groups of orcas passed by us heading south around Burrows and Allen Islands We counted approximately 10-12 orcas and there seemed to be a small one. They were traveling quite spread out across the strait (ie. a large wide group, not following single file). This was approximately

10:15am
. They seemed to be traveling. One breeched but the others only surfaced to breathe as they were swimming. Other than the first orca close to shore, we saw one other rather large fin in the group. We encountered orcas in Rosario Strait once before, approx 2 years ago, on the south side of James Island. They were quite far away that time. Unfortunately all efforts to get a picture were unsuccessful. Also wanted to mention that there didn't seem to be any boats following this group or any boats in the area, in fact only one motor boat even noticed the first orca, and he stopped his engine to let him swim through.

Just observed a
humpback
off Pt. Defiance in
Commencement Bay
at about
noon
. It appeared to be feeding. It surfaced several times then disappeared for about 15 minutes. Next time it surfaced it was at the north end of the Narrows and looked to be heading South towards the bridges. Nice!

About
30 Harbor Porpoise
in
Port Madison Bay
(between Indianola and Suquamish) this
morning
. I've seen them several times recently but with the very calm waters this morning it is easy to spot them and see how many there are. Seem to be calmly feeding.

unknown large number of
Pacific White Sided Dolphins

Numerous
Dall's Porpoise
playfully bow and wake riding by Hole in the Wall, just below the Yuculta Rapids. (Probably happy the Transient Orca were gone - SM).
