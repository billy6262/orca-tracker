Orca Sightings for June 22, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dana Costello sighted a dark whale dive and lift its flukes off Toy Point,
Fox Island
@

17:00
. Physical, behavioral, and location description fits the
humpback
that has been swimming around near Pt Defiance and the Narrows.

Can't believe it is only June as it seems like mid July out on the west end of the
Santa Barbara Channel
. We got close encounters with at least
30 Blue Whales and 15 Humpbacks
, but there were a lot more spouts EVERYWHERE in the near and far distance. Incredible for June. Sightings were just north of the Santa Rosa/Santa Cruz Islands gap. We don't see many cow/calf pairs, so it was pretty cool. We also encountered about
a dozen Pacific White Sided dolphins
and 800-1000 (total of about 3 group sightings) Common Dolphins (see photo under "dolphins" below). Lots of Sea Lions and quite a few MolaMola's including babies. :)

We have had
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
feeding between The Mission Bay channel jetty/
San Diego River
(Dog Beach) and the Ocean Beach pier for the past few days. Monday (6/20) I observed some going into Mission Bay (most likely to get a snack from the bait barge). Today they were in close to the surf line and the ocean was very flat so I was able to observe multiple
dolphins
herding the bait fish with pressure wave together.

2 pm
: The same t
hree Transient Orca
including
T002C
were found in Whale Pass by Rendezvous Island headed in a North-Easterly direction. A short time later they did a bit of zig zag and started Southward. Garry left them around

3:30 pm
close to Hill Island in Sutil Channel with some other whale watching boats. These are the same whales that have been in and around the same general area over a number of weeks now. They appear and disappear every day or so probably into one of the many channels and inlets around and just above Desolation Sound.

A wonderful parade of whales passed our Orca Rock on
Galiano
today around

2:20 pm
. About 10 [
orcas
], fishing as they progressed through
Active Pass
. A resting line for a short period of time, then many tail slaps as they went by us.

The Center for Whale Research were with
Js and Ks
from
NW San Juan Island
at

6:30 am
, up to S. Pender Island at

10:12 am
. At
11:23 they were off the south end of Saturna Island, appearing to be continuing travel to the NE.
*
Resident killer whales
were reported at nearly the farthest point we can travel on our trips and they weren't coming our way south either. We crossed the border into Canada at the Haro Strait, went into Plumper Sound and between Mayne and Saturna Islands to pop out on the other side in the
Strait of Georgia
: we could see the city of VANCOUVER! A little farther north along Mayne Island and BAM: whales! They were all over the place and being a little sassy too. It looked like J30 "Riptide" and friends/family from
J-pod
were together, with several cow-calf pairs. Even further, many of the calves--and some of the adults--were incredibly active, with tail slapping, pec slapping, upside down tail slapping, SPY-HOPPING, and breaching! And not just the lazy kinda-sorta breaches; we're talking full on clear-the-water breaching!

Lots of
whistles and calls (S1, S16)
were detected by the WhoListener program this morning, first at
Lime Kiln
from

6:08-
6:19
, then at
Orcasound
(5 km north) from

7:47-
7:52
. Seems like some of the southern residents (
J and K pod
) are working the west side of San Juan Island, as members of both pods were observed and/or heard heading north towards and/or up through Haro Strait last night (5/21). Did they double back and then go north again this morning or were they really (~9 hours?) spread out?

Early this morning,
orcas
trickled by, slowly headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
. I saw the first ones at about

6:20 am
, but I suspect the true leaders came by earlier than that. Orcas continued to trickle past for about 2 hours. I believe I saw all six of the J17 family group, J16 and some of her group, along with other Js. The K13s and J27 were bringing up the rear. Yes, there was romance in the air, if you know what I mean. Maybe one of the K13s will have a little one about a year and a half from now.

It was a beautiful
orca
pass at
Lime Kiln
between
6 and
7:15 am
, some groups resting, close to the shore. Not a soul at the park either.
Sandy Buckley, San Juan Island, WA

I heard a bunch of tailslaps about

4:30
this morning (
west San Juan Island
). We had
Js
slowly make their way to Active Pass and then jet through. We had the Js in mid-Georgia Strait heading East towards Point Roberts. Heard later they were headed back south!
John Boyd, San Juan Island, WA

I got up at

4:30
and we were out with the whales by

5:45-
6:00
. There were almost if not all of
J-Pod and the K13's
. It was an awesome encounter.
