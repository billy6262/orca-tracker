Orca Sightings for June 2, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a text from Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries, relaying a report from Jeff saying a
Humpback
whale was sighted off
Pt. No Point
, WA (N Kitsap Peninsula) sometime in the
afternoon
.

We motored out to Salmon Bank and then
Hein Bank
, areas known for schools of herring and, subsequently, birds and marine mammals feeding on the abundant food source. A female and calf
Minke
whale were seen by other vessels in the area. At Hein Bank, we spotted
several more Minkes
nearby. One curious creature passed within 120 yards of our vessel, bringing its rostrum--the top of its head--out of the water a few times. It's rare that we glimpse more than the dorsal fin of a Minke whale! Despite an absence of sea birds, it is possible that these Minkes were foraging. In total, there were
four animals
spread out over several hundred yards.
Harbor porpoises
made themselves known on our trip as well, though for just a quick glimpse of a gray dorsal fin or two.
