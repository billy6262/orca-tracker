============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Meredith Gafill, reporting a sighting of
6 orcas
off
Big Sur, CA
this
morning
. She and her husband were walking along the highway, and spotted 1 adult male with another orca traveling nearby, and 4 other orcas, spread out ~100 ft. apart from each other, traveling south. When they first saw them they were about 300 yards offshore, by the time they reached Wild Bird, where there is a steep drop off to a deep water area, the whales were ~100 yards offshore.
