Orca Sightings for January 11, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from fisherman Richard Ogg, reporting
5 orcas
, including 2 males, hunting a Steller sea lion at around
8 am
this morning in
Bodega Bay, CA

31N 123

18W. The sea lion was using his boat as a shelter to try to escape the orcas, so it sounds like things got pretty exciting for him!
