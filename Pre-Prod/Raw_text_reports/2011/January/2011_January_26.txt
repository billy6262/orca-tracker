Orca Sightings for January 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a pod of
9 Orcas
on
San Juan Islands
west side at approx
6pm
. The pod was about 75 yards off the coast and appeared to be feeding as they were all lined up side by side. We spotted them about 1 1/2 miles south of Lime Kiln State park right off West Side Rd located on the SW side of San Juan Island looking out towards the Straight.

I received a call from Ivan Reiff, of the Western Prince, that [orcas] had been spotted in
San Juan Channel
. Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research, Ivan, Chris and I went on the Western Prince out of Friday Harbor. At

10:35
we saw blows off to the north. As the whales approached we could see it was the
J-11s, the J-17s, the J-22s and four K Pod
whales, Cappuccino
K-21, Raggedy K-40, Opus K-16 and Sonata K-35
as they leisurely headed down San Juan Channel, passing by the entrance to Friday Harbor. We left the whales a few miles north of Cattle Pass. A short while later they exited the south end of San Juan Channel and began heading up island, approaching
Salmon Bank
at

1:00
. When they reached False Bay they changed their course and headed offshore, toward Discovery Island. I last saw them 2 to 3 miles offshore, at

3:20
, heading west.

We just (

11:06 am
) had whales in
San Juan Channel
! I was watching from the museum (thanks to JB's call!) so I couldn't identify anyone but Western Prince is with them now.

John Boyd reported via Facebook at
~11 am
that
orcas
were sighted in
San Juan Channel
. Update from John Boyd at

12:30
: members of
J Pod and some Ks
(same group as Sunday) heading south. Sounds like we have the
J17s, J22s, J35s, and K40
.

My husband believes he saw
4 orcas
today, between
Smith Island and Sunset Beach on Whidbey Island
. Couldn't be positive as we're new at this, but saw them about
2:00 headed south.
