Orca Sightings for January 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico Orcas
Below is a report of
orcas
off
Puerto Vallarta
, forwarded to us by David Geist: We were told by the plane that there was a group of 5 Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) by the Marietas Islands with some large dolphins swimming ahead of the group. On arrival (N20°38.935', W105°34.880'. 09.29 17/01/2011) the unidentified dolphins were feeding on schools of small rays, possibly bat rays (Myliobatis californica). We originally thought they might be False Killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens),due to the size, colour and dorsal fins. When they came closer, we could see the small white patch above the eye. They were indentified as 4 female Orcas (Orcinus orca), they were of a relatively small size, under 22 ft, and had small falcate dorsal fins. It appeared there was no male in the pod. At one point they started to play around the boat (33ft rigid inflatable), moving around and underneath us. There was a surface-active group of humpback whales in close proximity (less than 1000ft) engaging in intra-specific competitive behavior, including tail slashes and breaches. Although the two whale species were very close on several occasions (under 10 ft) we saw no real signs of aggressive behavior between them.
