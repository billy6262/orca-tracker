Orca Sightings for January 29, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went to Lime Kiln to check out the lighthouse and to gaze out at the sound. A
minke whale
spouted and then dived 3 or 4 times before he was out of our sight.It was about
4pm
. It was misting and not many people were around. I'd say 4 or 5 others witnessed the sighting.

Here is a link to an article in the Easy Reader that came out today about the
4 transient killer whales
that were sighted off
Manhattan Beach CA
by the whalewatch vessel Voyager (and others). These killer whales were CA49 and her offspring:
CA49B, CA49C
, and new calf
CA49D
. They chased down, killed, and ate a common dolphin.This matriline was also seen off Long Beach in
May 2010.
