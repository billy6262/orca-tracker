Orca Sightings for January 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on the phone with my mother, who lives in
Olympia
, about an hour and a half ago (11 am), when she spotted a
"baby" orca
. I've suggested that she provide her own posting to provide more detailed information.

(email from Mona's mother Margaret, after receiving our email suggesting it might be the
Bottlenose dolphin
that has been sighted in south Puget Sound recently): You are right. I was seeing the bottle nose dolphin. The skin condition led me to think I was seeing white markings. The poor little dolphin swam around for several hours, enough time for me to call Cascadia Research. Lisa and an intern and a volunteer came out. My neighbor has forwarded his photos to them. It was all very exciting for our little cove (and our resident seals). I am quite concerned about this warm water mammal in this water, but after two hours he/she headed north.
