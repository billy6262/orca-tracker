Orca Sightings for January 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am reporting a possible
orca
sighting at

3:00PM
from the bluffs above
Glass Beach at Fort Bragg, CA
. It is estimated that they were approximately 1/3 mile offshore and were heading south at a speed that appeared to be faster than gray whales travel. They also were blowing very frequently (every few seconds) compared to what I have seen before. There were at least six in a tight pod (as seen in photo to follow), but I suspect more. There were also two spouting, one to the right and one to the left of the main pod, about 100 yards behind the main pod and separated from each other by maybe 200 yards.
