Orca Sightings for March 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Maria Mason and others saw
four orcas
off
Pt. Robinson on Vashon Island
at

9:30 am
, headed toward Tacoma. This matches the 2nd hand report Amy Carey called in on Thursday as well, so it's great to have this sighting confirmed! Likely Transients due to the number of orcas and the fact they were so sneaky that not many folks saw them.

Here are a few pictures from yesterday 24-Mar-11. We saw
6-10 killer whales
(best guess 8 total) at

15:00
near
Umatilla Reef
W 48 11.90 N 124 44.89. The group was pretty spread out and we attempted photo ID of individuals (possibly K-pod group?) We would really appreciate getting back the ID of these whales for our records!
Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician,
Makah Fisheries Management
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research confirmed the ID's of these as
K pod
whales, positively ID'd from the photos are
K12, K22, K26, and K33
. Ks usually aren't around this time of year, but we have records of K and J pods off San Juan Island
April 20-21, 2001; and in 2006 K and L pods were in south Puget Sound
March 3rd, Possession Sound
March 5th and off the WA coast
March 31st.

We heard a rumor that maybe some Transients were off the Victoria waterfront "somewhere". By the time we were on-scene, we were in sight of the
Race Rocks Lighthouse
, but it was cool to see
T103 and the T30s
on the prowl. As we slowly approached, we got a very strong whiff of harbor seal, which T103 had just dispatched prior to our arrival. There was still a sheen on the water, and it was a reminder of the power of these animals. The whales then began doing as Transients are known to do--lots of long, erratic dives, being totally unpredictable, and yet it was great watching our passengers get into trying to figure out where they'd surface next. We left the whales slowly trending back towards Victoria.

I spotted
T103 and the T30's
south of
Constance Bank
. They spent the day foraging throughout the area. T103 was last seen heading south west near Race Rocks and the T30's were tracking back to the north east towards Victoria
late afternoon
.
