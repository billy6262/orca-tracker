Orca Sightings for March 31, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
4-5 pm
, a neighbor alerted us that there was a whale off
Snakelum Point
, so Bill and I walked down to the shore. It was
a single gray whale
and was actively feeding east of the point, in
Saratoga Passage
. We watched for 30-45 minutes. Another neighbor that was there at first told us there were two whales, but it was definitely just one, very likely the same one Dan Dalmeida reported. I suspect the person on the beach near Lovejoy was mistaking the "twin fins" of fin and flukes of the side-feeding whale for two whales, as happens a lot (as you know!). It was missing the tip off at least one point of the tail, and looked like it might have had a fairly new surface wound (pinkish color) along spine between dorsal fin and tail.

Around

3:15pm
there was an adult
gray whale
moving rapidly eastward along the southern shoreline of
Penn Cove
. My friend Eric Rogers and I were kayaking westward toward the Coupeville Wharf and we first spotted the whale(s) off Lovejoy at
3:15pm. We were paddling that direction and within 5 minutes and three more surfacings along the shore, it suddenly rose about 40 yards to our left (we had moved offshore when we saw it moving along the shore) and had changed directions to move offshore, directly toward us! We saw about 20 ft. of it's back and then it's fluke as it was going for a deeper dive. We paused about a minute then continued westward and never saw it again. At it's rate, it probably would have been to Snakelum Pt. by 345pm or so. Further on, we saw someone on the beach near Lovejoy who said there were actually two whales involved.

There is currently a whale between
Point No Point
and Norwegian Point. Our neighbor thinks it'a a
Humpback. Either that or a Grey
(
most likely a Gray
, especially given the report below from the same area).
