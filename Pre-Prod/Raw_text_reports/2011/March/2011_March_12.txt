Captain John Stone called from the Capt. Whidbey Inn with a report of a

6 pm
. There was a big splash.

"Spouting News" - SPOUTS IN HIGH WINDS/CHOPPY SEAS CREATE HOUSE EXCITEMENT. A delight to share first of the season sighting, of one
gray whale
off Mariners Cove. On a 10.3 high tidal change, at

3:10 PM
, today, just happened to glance out window and see a spout, amidst whitecaps. Gray was couple hundred yards from shore and after a couple of more spouts, it went further out to mid channel. And continued its travels; northeast, towards
Whidbey Island's Strawberry Point on Skagit Bay
. No feeding activity, even though it was high tide. Appeared not to be in any hurry. Possibly challenged a bit, with tidal resistance/rough seas; as it headed on its way.
