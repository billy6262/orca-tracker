Orca Sightings for March 5, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Confirmation of
Gray whale #53
and report from Cascadia Research: Amber Klimek was able to confirm (the Gray whale photographed by Howard Garrett
March 3) was CRC ID 53, so that is great news and good timing for the initial confirmed return. 53 had been seen at 13 different years going back to 1991. Last year 53 was not one of the initial whales confirmed in the area and a positive ID not obtained until 24 March, so 53 appears to have arrived a little earlier this year.

I want to report an
orca
attack observed off Cypress Point,
Monterey, CA
.
Three orcas
(two large females and a calf) attacked a pair of northbound (I presume)
gray whales
. We observed them around noon for approx. 40 minutes. The orcas left the grays and the grays continued on, heading towards shore. We have nominal video and some stills. I am gathering the photo assets from passengers today and will send along the clearest images. It was very exciting!
