============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a
whale
just off the shore of the North end of
Lincoln Park
around

5:30 - 6ish
. Single, very large. I only saw large, dark back surface after a spray caught my attention. Only 20 or 30ft from shore.

These beautiful
Orcas
were in the
Port Angeles
harbor around
6 pm
this evening. They played by the Coho ferry then jaunted across the harbor, coming within 50 feet of the city pier. What an amazing experience!

Mark Mallseon of Victoria, B.C. had
Transient orcas T87, T88, T90's, T30's and T124's
, about 12 in all, from
Trial Island
about
11 am
, traveling east to Middle Bank, still headed toward Salmon Bank. He left them at

3:15 pm
.

While walking the coastal trail I observed
two orcas
traveling west into
Port Angeles
harbor at

2:30 p.m
. One distinct bull and one female or immature. I presumed they were transients but made no attempt at ID, since restricted to observing from shore at a distance. By the time I returned to our waterfront office, they were milling between the commercial pier and a floating log boom. Our local paper caught some good images, on-line version here.

6:53 pm
-
One gray whale
, spotted about 50-75 yards from shore, about 1/2 mile north of
Langley, Whidbey Island
. S/he was swimming slowly down Saratoga Passage and surfaced six times over about 5-10 minutes, releasing air from a blow hole - the noise drew my attention. Then s/he did a small tail flip and disappeared from sight. Beautiful!

5:30-
6:30 p.m.
- our first
orca
sighting off
Lummi Island
this year! -
group of 12-15
off Village Pt. - VERY spread out and milling, back and forth - some lunging, tail lobs -mostly way out in the channel, between Lummi and Orcas/Matia islands - a couple of good sized males - no clear direction of travel at this time. Beautiful spring evening, calm water, no wind- could hear their breaths across the water - hopefully will see more of them soon!

I've been hoping sometime I'd have an
orca
sighting to report, and today is the day! A few passengers on the

6:00 pm
sailing from Anacortes to Friday Harbor this evening had an unexpected and nice surprise. I was sitting close to the front on the starboard side of the Kaleetan just as she was leaving
Rosario Strait
and entering Thatcher pass (in the vicinity of the navigational marker on Lawson Rock,) I was looking over towards Blakely and thought I saw a fin in the distance Sure enough, it surfaced again. I had binoculars with me and while I was trying to get them out of my bag, I looked up again, and
two different orcas
surfaced just forward of where I was sitting, heading east, and no more than 20 -30 yards from the ferry. I expected the ferry to slow down, but whoever was on the bridge must not have seen them, as they kept going. The whales only surfaced that one time and we didn't see them again.
