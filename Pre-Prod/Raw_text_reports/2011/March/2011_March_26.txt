Orca Sightings for March 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
two types of Orca / Killer Whales
in the
upper Johnstone Strait
area.
Transient (meat eating) Orca
were seen around
Lagoon Cove
, close to
Minstrel Island
. There was a report of around 5 whales.

I have a secondhand report of
a gray whale
feeding on the west side of
Vashon
at about
8 pm
, just south of
Fern Cove
. This is probably the same gray that was feeding near Southworth earlier in the day.

7:12 pm
: Ann Casey of Whidbey Island called to say she was riding the ferry from Edmonds to Clinton when she saw
two gray whales
close to
Possession Point
.
*

7:10 pm:
We are watching whale spouts from our house looking west over
Useless Bay
! We are pretty sure they are
Grays
because we have not seen any dorsal fins, but they have not come very far out of the water. They are heading south but very slowly. We have seen two spouts in different locations but I'm not sure how many there are. I think they must have been feeding because they stayed in the same general area for at least 20 minutes. The lighting was just perfect which is why we could see the spouts.

On our way back from Coupeville today we saw another
gray whale
off
Clinton
, heading south. It seemed to be on a mission to get somewhere, surfacing frequently and even porpoising once. Our captain clocked him going 8 kts. I was able to ID it as
#531
from several passenger photos of flukes.

When I called you at

3:00pm
from Mukilteo, we first spotted a blow and surfacing of a
Gray whale
on the south side of the
Clinton
ferry terminal (thanks to the slowing of the Clipper). The whale moved steadily at a swift pace southward hugging Whidbey. It held a distinctive pattern of surfacing 7 times, then the dive. Each w/healthy blows, followed by his body, and finale's of full fluke before diving 4-5 minutes. Multiple times we were rewarded with it's head breaking surface prior to the blow. We watched the whale continue south in this pattern down Possession channel in calm waters. The whale reached
Possession Point
at

4:00pm
. We then drove to Picnic Point, Lynnwood, where we were met by a bit of a storm and now choppy waters. It took us until

5:00
to find the whale again, it was mid channel Puget Sound due west from Picnic Point (a bit west of the southbound temporary Clinton/Edmonds ferry lane). We watched this whale move/circle around in the same general area for an hour and a half until

6:30
feeding in fairly shallow water between Scatchet head and Possession pt. At
6:00 we spotted
2 other gray whales
closer to Whidbey, south of the green buoy off
Satchet head
, moving east towards Cultus Bay. We then saw (at least) a
fourth
off in the distance into
Admiralty/Useless Bay
area heading down into the sound. When we left at
7:00pm the first whale was making it's way towards towards Whidbey and the green buoys, the 2nd two were passing Possession Point heading northeast up Possession channel hugging Whidbey and the fourth was heading in, direction southeasterly. Quite a beautiful event having, at times, 3 different blows in our binoculars in multiple places of the sound simultaneously. Sweet to think we were witnessing perhaps a mini migration down from Admiralty.

Gray whale
spouting and showing flukes, one-half mile south of
Clinton
Ferry dock, 100 yards off Columbia Beach at

3:15 pm
.
Charlotte Carpenter and Mary Powers, Clinton.

Bob at the Greenbank Post Office reported seeing
a Gray whale
off NW Whidbey Island,
between NAS Whidbey and Rocky Pt
, first headed north, then heading south, at
3 pm
.
*

Entry 2:
Offshore Orca
, which are seldom seen in the inside waters below Cape Scott were confirmed to be in the
Robson Bight Area
on the 26th and 27th. These whales spend most of their time farther afield, and as their name implies, offshore and closer to open waters. Their vocalizations are haunting sounds that are very different to those of Resident and even Transient Orca.

~

12:45 -
1:30 pm
: Amy Carey and Meg McDonald saw the
gray whale
from
Vashon Island
, about a half mile south of the Southworth ferry dock, still going through feeding motions.
*
Stephanie Raymond on the Clipper 3 just called in a report at

11:00 and
11:25
of at
at least four grays
in total, two or three on the south side of
Gedney (Hat) Island
and two more on the north side of the island, heading south, a few miles west of Everett.
*

11:45 am: Grey's
at SE end of
Gedney island
.

A
gray whale
has been going back and forth in shallow water near the
Southworth
ferry dock, just west of
Vashon Island
, all morning, called in by Erik Ferrel at

9:38 am
.
*
March 26/27 - Automated detections of calls and clicks (below) at the
Orcasound
hydrophone suggest they have have been north of Lime Kiln (
W San Juan Island
) when you heard them faintly.
S1 and S4 calls
with many clicks auto-recorded on OrcaSound hydrophones from

19:04 through
20:07
. No auto-detections at Lime Kiln.

Offshores
in the Broughton Archipelago,
Johnstone Strait
, again TODAY!!!!

Entry 3:
7:50 pm:
I hear the
orcas
(on
OrcaSound
hydrophone).
Jane Cogan, San Juan Island
*
Heard two faint
calls
just now

7:48pm
on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
.

Maria Mason, Jeff Mason, Linda Carnegie, and Marian Webster watched
a gray whale
feeding, sometimes 30' from shore, off Broomgerrie Rd. across from Skiff Point, not far from Yeomalt Pt. and Murden Cove (
Bainbridge Island
), from

5:30 to 8 pm
(see photo above). The whale was on its side often, moving slowly in circles, blowing every few minutes, in 10' deep water over a mudflat (sounds like feeding behavior).
*
They're back (
Gray whales
). We had one this morning around

9:30
. He hung out for awhile and scratched on some old dock piers so he was close to shore but the tide was up. Now we have
two
rolling around out there at

3:00 pm
. My husband says they have been going back and forth in the bay all afternoon. Tide is lower so they aren't as close. We have had whales almost everyday for a week.

We saw these
gray whales
about
10 - 11 am
, at the Southeast end of
Whidbey Island
. We were on the Victoria Clipper Whale watching trip. Hope you can identify them. There were
3 whales
, and we watched them for about an hour. It looks like the whales were #53, and possibly #356.

Report received

8:58 am:
We saw at least two
Pacific White-sided dolphins
from the point by the pool at Lincoln Park in
West Seattle
. They were north of Blake Island & we saw them surface two or three times before we lost track. No pics, alas. They had black below and smudgy grey above, and we can't be sure how large, as we have lousy binocs (this'll cause us to get better ones!), but they appeared to be 6-7 feet long. In other words, at first we thought they might be orcas, but we quickly realized that the size and coloration were all wrong. They may have been Dall's, but when we looked at the American Cetacean Society website, we both thought that what we saw looked just like a Pacific white-sided dolphin. So, we're not certain, but we think....No jumping that we saw. Quick arcing surfacing. I saw no large splashes. Wish I could tell you more, but they were quite distant. Pacific White-sided dolphins are quite unusual to see in the inland waters, but it has happened before. It is also possible these may have been Dall's or Harbor porpoise - ON

A little after midnight on
March 25/26, we saw a post on Facebook by EJ Christiano, alerting us to
Offshore orca
calls being heard on OrcaLab's Orca Live hydrophones off Hanson Island,
N. Vancouver Island, B.C.
We tuned in at about

12:20 am
, and listened for several hours - mesmerized by the strange calls of this not-often heard or seen from Orca ecotype. Unfortunately, our recording software was not cooperating on ANY of our computers, thankfully Jan Twillert in Holland managed to record the offshores picked up live
March 26 in Johnstone Strait. It's highly unusual for offshores to come inshore and hang around hydrophones for several hours.
*

2:10 am:
They're still singing!
Nancy Nolan, Langley, WA

Listened to the
offshores
in last evening from ~
1 to 2 a.m.
, and I definitely have not heard a collection of calls like that before. Was a very cool way to end a very long week!

1 am:
still going! Awesome!
Tim Green (via Facebook)

12:47 am
: It's wonderful to wake up in Austria with their calls...here it's
08.47 a.m
.....so great to hear something like that :)
Alexandra Py (via Facebook)
*
Heard
offshores
about
9am
here in the uk, sounds were unlike any orca sounds i've ever heard. Very interesting though :)
Kerry Webb (via Facebook)

Entry 4:
00:43: The Offshores are still quite vocal in the Bight!! They are making some very neat calls :) It doesn't seem like they are in a hurry as they've been in Johnstone strait for 6 hours now!!! The last calls where around
4am
and unfortunately it was hard to decipher which way they went as there was very loud boat noise.

11:35 am:
There has been a
lone gray whale
at (
Elger Bay SW Camano Island
) for probably an hour and a half, just feeding.
Bill Guns
*
We had a single large adult
Gray
feeding in
Elger Bay, off Camano Island
around

8:30 this morning
. Based on feeding pits I saw at low tide a day earlier, I would say this is our second visit this season.
