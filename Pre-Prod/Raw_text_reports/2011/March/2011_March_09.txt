Orca Sightings for March 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

5:45 pm
I began hearing sounds but could not confirm calls until well after
6pm
. They first became clear on Orca Sound hydrophones and then faint calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones. The calls were definitely
J Pod calls.
From the volume of the calls and the locations, OS then LK hydrophones, I believe the whales were far off shore heading south in Haro Strait. Some calls that could be heard clearly were still at a good distance from shore. The last calls I heard were at about

9:20 pm
.
