Orca Sightings for March 21, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
returning to the area! Although it was a second hand report and received only last evening, Some (I didn't get any numbers) Pacific White Sided Dolphins joined up with the Comox ferry on one of it's afternoon runs to
Powell River
to wake ride for a short time on either Monday the 21st or Tuesday the 22nd of March. They never made it as far as Powell River and there was no direction passed on to me. With sightings of the dolphins in the Howe Sound area around Vancouver, I can assume that these ones were headed towards one of their favorite spots around Cortez and Marina Islands below Campbell River.
