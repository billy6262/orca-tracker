Orca Sightings for March 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Connie Barrett of Camano Island called at

10:10 am
with one
Gray whale
north of
Cama Beach, Camano Isl.
heading south, mid-channel but closer to the Camano side.
*
After a call from Connie Barrett just after 10 AM to say she saw a gray whale heading south in
Saratoga Passage
, the first
gray whale
reported this year swam slowly south at about
11 AM
. I watched from a 200' bluff over Hidden Beach, just north of Greenbank as the whale surfaced within a hundred feet of shore, then turned back southward toward the middle of the Passage. I was able to get a shot of the fluke, which appears to be #53, one of the ten or so Saratoga Grays who feed here during spring.
