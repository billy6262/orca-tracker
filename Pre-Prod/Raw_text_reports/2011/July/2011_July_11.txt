Orca Sightings for July 11, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

7:08
this evening I was traveling from
Edmonds to Kingston
on the ferry and sighted a single baleen whale heading north. It was too far away for me to say for sure what the species was (no binoculars :-( ). It was either gray or humpback, but if I had to say I'd say it was a
humpback
based on the blow and movement.

This fits previous reports of one or two
humpbacks
south and west of Whidbey Island for over a week - ON

This
afternoon
, members of
J and K pods
slowly headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
. I saw
J2 Granny, the J17s, J27
, and a number of other J pod orcas which I have not yet attempted to identify. In the middle of the parade, I also saw
K20, K38, K27, and newborn K44
. I would surmise that all the Js and the K13s headed north. I could not determine any L pod orcas were in the mix.

Heading south out of Friday Harbor we turned on the speed and booked it
towards Cattle Pass
! We first arrived on scene to a nice spread out pod of
Orcas
, looking to both our left and right there were orcas near and far! They seemed to be traveling in a "zig-zag" pattern, which is notorious to feeding habits, so we dropped our hydrophone in to take a listen! Sure enough they were "clicking" and vocalizing! We sat in silence and awe as we listened to the clicks get louder and louder, we couldn't see them as they were on a longer dive, but we could hear them! Soon enough a mother and calf came to the surface and let us have a really good look.Â­ It was
K-27
and her brand new (less than a week old) calf
K-44
! The new calf seemed to be exploring his new abilities with his tiny 6-7ft body as he porpoised and splashed through the surface of the water. We sat in silence for a while as the mother and calf made their way off and just when we thought we got our last look at them they reappeared with over 16 other members of K Pod!! We watched in awe as the pod grouped all together and headed straight for the boat! We were stuck where we were and surrounded by orcas! Gracefully as ever, they skimmed the surface headed straight for the boat, they sank right under the water calmly passing underneath and resurfacing on the other side! It was so amazing to see how aware of us they were as we were to them! I don't think they had as much fun watching us as we did watching them as they slowly moved away from our boat, all in unison and synchronized perfectly. At this point we were all stunned and amazed!

...clicks now at 1510...Only hearing calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones again at this time (1535)....sounded like a mix of K and L Pod calls at
Lime Kiln
, but
Orca Sound
hydrophone calls sounded more like Js with S4s and S7s.
