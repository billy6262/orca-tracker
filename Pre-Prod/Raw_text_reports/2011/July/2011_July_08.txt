Orca Sightings for July 8, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
J and K Pods
passed by
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
heading south between

4:30 and
5:15 PM
. Most whales were quite a ways offshore, and there was a lot of breaching going on. The whales were pretty backlit, but from my photos I was able to ID
K20, K38, K25, J2, J14, J30, J37, J26, and J17
.

Late this
afternoon
, resident
orcas
headed south along the west side of
San Juan Island
. Most were about a mile off shore as they rounded Kellett Bluff and headed down Haro Strait, porpoising their way south. Update at

10:06 pm
: Orcas northbound, or so it seems. It is almost getting to dark to see them.
Jane Cogan, San Juan Island, WA
*
Jenny Wilson of Friday Harbor reported lots of
orcas
foraging and lunging in the waves north of
Eagle Pt
., west
San Juan Island
, at

7:30 pm
. Some of the whales were in close, others further out.
*
~ 6 pm: Orcas
going past
False Bay
, heading south pretty fast.

We met up with southbound [
orcas
] in
Haro Strait
at about

3:00pm
between Spieden and San Juan Island. Radio reports told us that the group closest to us included
K44
. Members of this tight, somewhat synchronized group included
K25, K20, K38, K13 and K27 with K44
tucked along either the outside or in between mom and K20. Each time J44 surfaced he was underneath a huge stream of bubbles from his exhalation (see photo below) - still getting his breathing timing down? A whale spyhopped close by. Checking out what all the ruckus was about? Group continued south - one adult whale rolled over and did a mouth-open inverted tail lob. Tail lobbing by K20 and K38. A few members broke off for a bit of foraging. A couple other members were further offshore, porpoising south, Another couple groups went by,
J2, J8, and J47
included. There were some cartwheels and breaches, one of which was by L87 - and he got total air - 100% out of the water. Awesome. We departed around

3:50
, the trailing group just having passed south through Spieden Channel.

'The little fella',
K44
, was sticking close to Mum (Deadhead - K27) and shore off
Saturna Island
at
2.00 pm
today. The weather was calm, and with the engines cut back on 'Mystic Sea' we could hear the blows as K pod traveled and foraged, some in small tight groups, others on their own. Breaches were in fashion today - let's show 'the little fella' how it's done.
Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island, Washington St

[
Orcas
] spread out all over
Boundary Pass
today, looked like more than one pod but we only spent time with
K's
. Lots of activity and they were moving south pretty fast. We saw
K26, K33
and then a group of 4 juveniles porpoising down the pass together. Here's a picture of a K pod member kelping (see photo below).

There's a theory among whale watch captains that whales breach more when the waves are choppier. Last night's trip was definite proof for that theory! As we traveled northwest (up west
San Juan Isl
), sea spray was blowing over the bow and the port side of the boat; everyone took shelter. But then finally, our efforts paid off and we began to see dorsal fins and whale breath about 400 yards off our starboard bow:
L-pod
. We came about to travel behind the southbound killer whales. The chop and wind continued but the whales seemed to love it because just then, the breaching began! And I don't just mean one or two breaches, I mean forty to fifty over the course of thirty minutes! We had baby orcas breaching, whales breaching in call-and-response style, three whales breaching in a row, two whales breaching simultaneously, three baby whales breaching side by side, on and on. And then, the ultimate: a large mature adult male fully cleared the water in a breach! Was he showing the whale calves how it's done? Were we witnessing a teaching seminar on the how-tos of impressive breaching? We were surely impressed as humans watching!

On the ferry back to Anacortes I was in the midst of my Orca Network/Whale Museum killer whale ferry talk when a passenger informed me of orcas off our starboard, just east of the
Lopez ferry dock
. The ferry slowed, and a worker announced "two baby orcas" had been sighted. In reality, mom and a youngster. I saw one surfacing, then they dove deeper, eluding the ferry and we moved on. Transients from the look of the mom's dorsal/earlier reports?
Heather Hill, San Juan Excursions
(
yes, Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research identified the whales in the photo as: "T49A1 maybe with his younger sibling" - ON
)

Out with the whales on PS Express -
6 transients
including 2 babies by
Smith Island
(off NW Whidbey Island, WA) - the seals were very alert and out of the water.

Reports came in that there were up to
12 Transient Orca
around Deep Water Bay - the tours were looking. Most radio reception broke off since the tours wound up in the inlets and traveled as far as Kelsey Bay in
Johnstone Strait
.

5:30 pm:
8 Transient Orca including a calf were between Savary Island and Lund heading towards
Powell River
.
Dulcie Macdonald, Savary Island

6:30 pm
:
4 Adult Transient Orca
and one calf had been splashing about on a possible kill between the East side of Harwood Island and the Mainland. They were headed southward towards the
Powell River
Mill and Ferry Terminal but took a long dive.
Terry Brown & Jude Abrams (spelling?) aboard the SV Blue Parrot

7:20 pm
: The perfectly lit blows from the
10 to 12 Orca
as they cruised past Westview towards Grief Point. Dinner guests and I enjoyed the show.

Judith Alophsen called Orca Network to report seeing a
Humpback
1 mile north of the
Edmonds ferry dock
in the
morning
. She watched it breach 2 - 5 times, as it headed toward the Victoria Clipper that stopped to view the whale.
*

8:47 am
: Large Humpback Whale blow spotted just West of Mitlenatch Island heading Southward. By
9:15 am: the Humpback Whale was down by Sentry Shoal still Southbound. There were a few tours out there including AJ from Painter's Lodge,
Powell River
