Orca Sightings for July 13, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
They were first picked up east bound off of
Sooke
in the morning and met up with the
T185's
briefly near William Head. Here the
T099's and T036A's
took out a harbor porpoise and eventually continued east for Discovery Island after parting ways with the T185's. They were last seen heading north up the west side of Haro on a line for Darcy Island. The
T123's
went south east for Dungeness.

We received a call at

5:38 pm
from JR Zamore (sp?), reporting sighting
1 orca whale
while bottom fishing off
Westport
.
*
J pod
porpoised north along the west coast of
San Juan Island
, as each breath exposed most of their flanks. Traveling at great speeds, the orcas manipulated the drag of water to propel their colossal bodies forward and out into the frictionless air. The pod was separated into smaller groups which were in tight formations. We identified Riptide (J-30) in the first trio and later saw a group of four which included Mike (J-26). The excitement continued as we entered the narrow chutes of Cattle Pass on our return to Friday Harbor. Within the strong currents our boat strained through, there were over thirty harbor seals enjoying the food it transports. Once back in calm waters, we were suddenly surrounded by numerous harbor porpoises which are normally elusive and seen individually or in small groups. We turned off the engine and listened to their exhales as they passed in front and behind our boat.

Heard reports of Orca Whales by
Anacortes at 9am
, then in
Rosario around 1pm
, then heading west, south of
Lopez at 2pm
, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where we watched groups of
J-Pod
going by
Cattle Pass
at about

2:45pm
! They slowed down as they hit Salmon Bank, as they typically do, spreading out, milling about, tail fluke slapping, rolling, and foraging in the strong 10+ flooding tide. Young whales breached passing Cattle Point Lighthouse! Mom-calf pairs stayed closer to shore, as they often do. I ID'd J-27 Blackberry, J-31 Tsuchi, J-22 Oreo and her kids J-38 Cookie and J-34 DoubleStuf, J-28 Polaris with 2 year old daughter J-46 Star. We thought we spotted J-26 Mike, by his left leaning dorsal fin, up with a group off of Granny's Cove. The sun came in and out, the water was like a pond. Now

4:15pm
, a juvenile
Minke whale
(Christy Hynde-Bank's calf?? Minke calves spend about 6 months with mom) foraging by Salmon Bank! I wonder if the Minke socialized with J-Pod, like the one did last season? Marine birds, Bald Eagles on Long Island, Harbor Seals and Harbor Porpoise in San Juan Channel, showed all the 'stars' of the Salish Sea!

Between
noon and 1pm
several
orcas
made the trek past the
south end of Lopez
. They were traveling very slowly and reversed directions several times out from Flint Beach. There were about 10 orcas, not traveling together. Well, I just looked out to see another orca going past now at
2pm
. I almost missed this one as the whale watch boats had all left. Correction, the whale watch boats are first coming into view now. The marbled murrelet study boat is getting a good orca trip too. So far I have seen 6 in this orca group, traveling east to west.

Multiple
orcas, at least 5 -7
whales sighed west of the
Whidbey Naval Air Station
today at about
1130
. There was at least one cluster of younger whales and nurse whale and some splashing and breeching. Multiple whale boats as well as another group of whales and whale boats closer to Lopez Island. J Pod once more or other residents?
