Orca Sightings for July 31, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just wanted to share....I had the incredible good fortune to be on a small tour boat
west of San Juan Island
with my childhood friend, Melody, when the resident
Orcas
had their gathering of the clans.
J, K, and L pods
were all coming in from north, south and east to form a superpod. 65 whales in all directions around us...It was a spectacular party time, with spy-hopping, tail-lobbing, cartwheels, breaching, blowing, porpoising, you name it, they displayed it. It was a joyful family reunion of the highest order.
"Granny," the matriarch of J pod is 100 years old, and there were two new calves. There are no words to describe the thrill of watching a ten ton beauty thrust out of the water, become airborn, twist and flip back into the water with a dramatic splash! We had front row seats to the most amazing demonstration of wild freedom imaginable. I am stunned and humbled and will never forget this truly awesome gift. Keep our waters clean, protect our salmon runs, (the survival of the Orcas depends upon the health of the salmon) and bring Lolita home (the last surviving Orca stolen from Penn Cove off Whidbey Island, living in a 35' tank at Seaquarium in Florida).

As we went around
Cattle Point
we spotted our first
killer whale
. Then, a little further ahead, there were many killer whales, at least ten of them, traveling close together. We were able to identify the new calf
(K-44) and Cappuccino
. We also believe there were some
J-pod
members in the mix. The juveniles were being particularly playful, spy hopping and tail slapping. One little guy also breached! In the midst of all the excitement, some salmon jumped out of the water in front of our boat. The whales then started heading close to shore, and right before they reached Lime Kiln they changed direction and headed back towards False Bay.
