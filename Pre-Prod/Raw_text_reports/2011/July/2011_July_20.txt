Orca Sightings for July 20, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
The time the
Orcas
are spending off the south end of
San Juan Island, by False Bay,
showing classic foraging, fishing behavior, makes me hope they are feasting on the Chinook Salmon! Today, with the tides settling down, the beginning of a flood tide,
L-Pod and K-Pod whales
were going back and forth, in 3 large groups, in different directions, then joining up. Rumor was J-Podders too, although I wasn't able to ID or photograph the group over by Eagle Point. From about

2:55pm to
4:20pm
, we watched the
L-12's
, which includes L-25 Ocean Sun and L-41 Mega!, and K-20 Spock with her 7 year old son K-38 Comet and others. Again they did a lot of tail-fluke slapping the water. I have noticed this prevailing behavior this season, is it helping to stun the fish? A few spy hops, then some resting groups, with a male by himself offshore. Then they all went on very long dives, hopefully with full stomachs!

The [
orcas
] were milling between
False Bay and South Beach
. Boats were spread out across the channel in every direction and we assumed the whales would be too. We saw a massive dorsal surface inshore of us, followed by a couple of mid size and then baby K! He was active. Super active. Rolling, tail slapping, porpoising high out of the water. The rest of the whales seemed to be indulging him and there were bouts of activity here and there between the little guy and the others. I couldn't take my eyes off them. It was the most active I have seen the whales in a week or two. There were 5 or so whales in the little group. The best part was that they just milled; spinning, rolling, spy-hopping, and pec-slapping.
