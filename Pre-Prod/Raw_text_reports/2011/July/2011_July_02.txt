5-
5:45ish

A picture of J2 "Granny" taken this evening north of False Bay during the celebration of her 100th birthday (see below). We were with
J8, J2, L87, J26

False Bay
. We heard some great vocalizations and echolocation over our hydrophone.

We came on scene at the bottom end of
Rosario Strait
with
J16, J26 and J2
on the day of her birthday celebration! We stayed with those whales for most of our trip as they cruised up towards San Juan Island and we got one big bellyflop from J26 but unfortunately couldn't catch it on camera.

We found the big guys;
killer whales
were off in the distance! We watched some younger juveniles lob-tailing and a group of four swim eloquently by. Then, in another direction a single large male dorsal fin sliced through the water attracting everyone's attention. A few moments later, out of nowhere he was joined by another male, and they made their way across the sea. On the way back in, we caught up with the two male killer whales again and stalled to watch them for a while longer.

On board the Island Explorer where we saw some of the
J's and 1 K, K-25
Scoter. As we headed up the west side of
San Juan Isl
. we saw the crowds gathered at Lime Kiln to celebrate J-2 Granny's birthday. What a rare opportunity to see her on this special day. We also encountered the J-16's & the J-22's. J-30, Riptide led the group southbound toward Lime Kiln. The whales were very spread out and I suspect more were making the trip southbound. We saw some awesome breaches, spyhops and happy tailslaps. Riptide and Mike are growing up to be big boys.

Between

3:00 and
3:30
we had a spread out group of
10-12 orcas
headed very slowly east-to-west past Flint Beach on South
Lopez Island
.

. [
Orcas
] east of
James Island
seen from the
Anacortes
to Friday Harbor ferry. One big breach - was that Granny celebrating her birthday as we sailed off towards San Juan to celebrate it too? It was a memorable event in a glorious setting. Perfect timing as members of J pod passed by including Blackberry (J27) and Princess Angeline (J17), with a couple of high energy breaches to pay tribute and salute the matriarch on her special day.

Orcas
passing
Lummi
this morning going south into
Rosario Strait
(

9:30 a.m.
) - 3 big males out there - very spread out - flat calm gorgeous morning - no boats - just the sounds of whale breath! looks like a good day for whale watching on the west side.

Orca Network received a call from Captain RJ, reporting
two humpbacks
, what looked like an adult and a two year old, at
1800
hours off Eglon, north of
Kingston, Kitsap County, WA
. They were breaching off Eglon, and were traveling north toward Pt. No Point.
*
The Scott's at
Bush Pt, SW Whidbey Island
, called to report seeing what appeared to be a Gray whale (though more likely one of the
humpbacks
reported in that area recently - see above report) off Bush Pt. at

6:45 am
and again at

10:30 am
, heading south toward Mutiny Bay.
*
After watching the killer whales for a while we went in search of
minke
whales that were reported nearby. We could see flocks of sea birds on and over the water up a head and as we neared closer the small dorsal of a minke whale came out of the water. It was an amazing site.
~Kristen, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris

Saw what appeared to be
two or three white sided dolphins
while boating near
Double Bluff on Whidbey Island
at

7:45 this evening
. They were fast moving. We kept our eyes pinned in their direction to see if they were dolphins or porpoise. They looked smaller and moved together like dolphins. It was choppy out there so we were happy that we spotted them. Beautiful.
Sarah Schmidt Berger
Without photos, it is difficult to know, but it is more likely they were
Dall's or Harbor porpoise
, though we have also had several Common dolphins in Puget Sound recently, and on rare occasions have had Pacific White-sided dolphins in the Salish Sea - ON
*
A group of about
6-8 Lags
(short for the latin name of Pacific White Sided Dolphins - SM) they were traveling/foraging/playful dolphins mid passage at Eagles Cove.
