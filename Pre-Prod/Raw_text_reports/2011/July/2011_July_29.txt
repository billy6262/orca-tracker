Orca Sightings for July 29, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Little
K44
was having a good look around at
1.30 pm
with several spyhops as he frolicked in choppy water off the west side of
San Juan Island
. Members of all three pods were present with a couple of small, tight groups (including K44) exhibiting a gradual change to more tactile and high velocity behavior, breaching, cartwheeling and lobtailing, after a fairly stately procession.

We found [
orcas
] right around
false bay
and they were milling, hunting, and doing other things that whales like to do. It looked like
K's and a few J's
here and there. Blackberry was making amorous advances toward one of the K ladies, who had a little one with her. Salmon were jumping, whales were pec slapping. The wildlife was all around rowdy.

Orca
sighting off coast of
san juan county park
! OMG! The orcas came to visit again last night, right in front of the county park! This time at

3:00am
! And maybe with a baby! Lots of vocalization and fin slapping! Can't believe how lucky we were to see them two nights in a row!
