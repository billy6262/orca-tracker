Orca Sightings for July 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
T010's and T026's
came south through
Oak Bay
, Victoria in the
morning
and dragged a couple of seals out of the Chain Islands. I left them south west of Trial Island at 0955 headed for Race Rocks.

I was off
Salmon Bank
today with a group of
transients
. It was a calm day on the water, and with engines off it was great to watch the t`s.

Out for the day in our little skiff on the west side of
Lummi Island
, were surprised by
J pod
on our way back in the early evening (
6-7pm
) heading south (from Sandy Pt. to Village Pt. into Rosario)- gorgeous evening with only one or two boats around - whales pretty much in travel mode spread out, with some circling and lunging action...nice look at one of the big guys, J26, who doubled back on us to our surprise...

Orcas
headed south along the west side of
San Juan Island
this
afternoon
. Like yesterday, most were quite some distance from shore as they rounded
Kellett Bluff
, and headed south. There were
K pod
members in the mix, but I do not know what other pods were represented.

Around
2:30pm from shore at
Lime Kiln
-Whale Watch Park. I assume they are the mixture of
J and K pods
that have been referred to earlier. Noted that there were two young whales in this group, not necessarily in the pictures. I saw a very young one, and the young one in the pictures.

(
orcas & minke
) Up the west side of
San Juan Island
it didn't take long to see a blow, and then another, and another. Stretching from shore to about a mile or so out were groups of fours and fives traveling mostly south. Just the M/V Sea Lion, about
20 Orcas
, and 40 very happy passengers. We shut down the engines and watched the animals slowly moving down island. We even had a chance to drop the hydrophone and pick up some incredible vocalizations. Its hard to describe the overall feeling on the water. But with no wind, no waves, no other boat noise, the backdrop of the olympics, clear views of Mt. Rainer as well as Mt. Baker, good Orca vocals on the hydrophone, and the sound of whales breathing, the first word that comes to mind is peaceful. We even saw some breaches, some porpoising, and some tail slapping. Then, on the way home, we saw a single Minke feeding around whale rocks, as well as a dozen harbor seals hauled out and lazing in the water.

3:30 pm: Southern Residents
are at
False Bay
right now heading south.

As we rounded
Henry Island
along the northern end of
San Juan Island
, we headed south along the Haro Strait and began to see boats in the distance spread out over several miles. Upon closer viewing, those boats happened to have numerous southern
resident killer whales
around them! We saw some orcas tail slapping or tail lobbing and one even tail slapping on its back! At one point, we had a large male swimming straight for us! We pulled forward to give him some space and eventually he turned towards another boat; was this a curious whale investigating his surroundings? Over the radio we heard that we were seeing a mixture of
J and K pods
.
