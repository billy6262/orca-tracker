Lots of [

going (south) by west side
Lummi Island
- looks like possibly a superpod! Lots of breaching, tail lobs, spyhops, lunging, circling - very active, very spread out - at least 40-50 whales going by for about and hour and a half! beautiful show!

At about

1:20pm
at
Eagle Point
... looks like
J17
, but I'm not certain. Caught it on the way down-- it was a horizontal, low breach. The orcas have been enjoying Eagle Point a lot these days, and have been around here a few times today already!
