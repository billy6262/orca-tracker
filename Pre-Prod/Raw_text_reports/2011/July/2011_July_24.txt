Orca Sightings for July 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we had a wonderful encounter with my old friend, the
Minke whale
toward Salmon bank. There were birds fishing everywhere. Just a couple minutes of patience rewarded us with a Minke sighting a couple hundred yards away. We watched the whale surface a couple more times and then noticed another a little farther away. We watched as the little Minke repeatedly stole the fish out from under the feisty aggregation of sea birds. It is always amusing to watch the sneaky little Minkes in action. When we finally pulled away from the scene we were surprised as one last Minke surfaced just off our port side. It was a great way to wrap up the trip.

I believe I sighted the
Long Beaked Common Dolphin
that has been frequenting
south Puget Sound
between

8:10 pm and
8:35 pm
. just south of Boston Harbor Light and out in front of Burfoot Park ¼ to perhaps ½ mile offshore. The dolphin put on quite an aerial show and made at least a couple dozen high jumps and splashes sometime very near passing boats. I was not particularly close to the animal and the light was starting to fade so even with a 300 mm lens on my older Nikon 100 digital camera I could not catch a lot of detail, but I did get some images which I have attached.

Today we encountered a group of
four killer whales off Kauai
. This is only the 2nd time we've seen killer whales in 12 years of field work in Hawaii (with over 1,500 odontocete sightings). When first found they were chasing a rough-toothed dolphin, although we were too far away to see the outcome of the chase.
We did manage to photo-identify all four
. More photos and information on the sighting on Cascadia Research project web page.
