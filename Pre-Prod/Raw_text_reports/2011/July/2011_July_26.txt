Today was an awesome
afternoon
on the
west side of San Juan Island
. The whales were visible from Lime Kiln Point State Park from

12:30-
6:00 PM
.
J- and K-Pods
started by coming slowly south, very spread out, against the flood tide. Then they all went north with the L12s, before turning and coming back south again. At times whales were right off the kelp, and other times they were well out in the middle of Haro Strait. Throughout the afternoon we saw a wide range of behaviors including tail slaps, breaches, spyhops, porpoising, and logging. The last group that went south around
5:45 PM was a big one, and included males J30, J34, J27, and L41 who were all rolling around together with several "sea snakes" visible. Between whales I saw and/or photographed, I identified members of every matriline in J- and K-Pods plus the L12s, so there were probably about 60 whales out there. It sure looked like they were having a good time out there, and all of us on shore were as well.

- So many
calls
this
afternoon
that I'm getting confused. Who's making the repeated descending calls, sort of S36-like? I've heard K (kitten) calls and L whistles, S4s, and many others, along with lots of nice echolocation.

J's and K's
visited
Saturna's East Point
from

7:45 am until about
8:45
riding the tail end of an ebb tide, heading towards Haro Strait. Extremely active and playful non-stop for as long as I could see them -- multiple double and triple breaches observed, and just about every other acrobatic maneuver -- cartwheels, headstands, you name it. In the range of about 30+ whales, led by J2 -- almost all visiting the kelp beds at the lighthouse passing as close to shore as possible. I can't say that there was too much obvious foraging, but J2 and two others, well ahead of the rest, doubled back after coming around Boiling Reef and headed into the channel that runs in the middle of the reef where the current is strongest, and seem to busy themselves there for three or four minutes before continuing on their way. I continued to watch them until around
9:30 when they disappeared behind Monarch Head. Not a single boat of any kind the whole time that I can recall.

Around the west side of
San Juan Island
, we started to see the tell-tale dorsal fins of the
orca whales
! We saw a cow-calf pair, two females and then a lone male traveling south along the island. Eventually, we saw three females/juveniles playing pass-the-bull-kelp! One animal had the kelp crossed over its dorsal fin while the others swam around in random directions to potentially catch it as the first orca dropped its "toy". Among some of the vessels offshore, we saw another eight whales in a closer group. Based on the vocalizations we heard on the hydrophone, we were seeing a very spread out resident pod of orcas. As we continued around the northern part of San Juan Island and then Henry Island we saw more bald eagles on Henry and Battleship islands, both perched at the tops of their respective trees scanning the sea. At O'Neal Island, we saw one more bald eagle and then headed for home.

There were many, many [
orcas
] out off
San Juan Island
last evening. A guest took a photo and Serena ID'd the orca as Cappucino. The orcas were doing lots of fishing. The movements they were making near the surface - back and forth, back and forth - then there were some spy hops and some well, was it "love" in the water? The seabirds were partying on an outcrop. Sea Lions and Harbor Seal were all having a snooze - lazin' about.

At

7:30 this morning
I saw a blow when I was almost to the
Bremerton Shipyard
parking lot. I parked and looked out over the water and saw another blow between the parking lot and the floating mothballed ships. The body with a very small dorsal fin came up and it looked smooth and black. I believe it was a Minke. It was about 8 minutes between blows and did not see it again. Looking at google images, it did look like a
humpback
... the small fin looked like a ridge but was pointed in the back. Very slow, but strong and graceful movement. I could not see any white and the blow was very visible, about 3' diameter and maybe 8' tall.
Andrew Doerr
With a visible blow and a pointed dorsal fin this sounds like a humpback, but a small gray whale died on a beach in Bremerton this morning, so it's possible that's what it was
.
