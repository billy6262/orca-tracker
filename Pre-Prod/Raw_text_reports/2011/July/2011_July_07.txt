Orca Sightings for July 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:45 am: 5 Orca
(assumed to be the group of
Transients
that from yesterday that didn't go through
Seymour Narrows
- SM). They were doing a number of large spy hops close in on the South West side of Savary Island. They headed West towards Vancouver Island between Sentry Shoal and Mitlenatch Island where they were lost in between the white caps.

OrcaSound Hydrophone reports:
~10 pm: Sounds like faint calls at Pt Townsend.
Kathy Stevens Hitzemann
I heard faint
calls
on
Pt. Townsend hydrophone
starting at the time of Kathy's original post (

9:30 ish
?). Then starting at
9:45 hearing them more distinctly. At
10:00 pm started hearing some S4 like honks and various whistles and calls that were consistently getting louder. Faint again by

10:20
or so with some whistle until
10:30, quiet by
10:40.

10:30 pm:
All I've heard for the last 12 minutes or so are little squeaks...sort of like Pacific white-sided dolphins perhaps.
Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA
We too heard the last 15 or so minutes of these
whistles and clicks
, what we heard sounded more dolphin-like, but we missed the earlier calls, and can't confirm what exactly we were listening to - could also have been orcas.

5:30 pm: Lone Humpback Whale
was left still in the same general area. Garry left it close to Turn Back Point by Arran Rapids.

About

7:20
this evening,
20+ orcas
went east through
Active Pass
. As they entered the Pass, their poofs were nicely backlit. The tide was running so fast that they just zoomed by us. It was the fastest whale show ever!

OrcaSound/Lime Kiln Hydrophone reports
:

9:59 am
PDT: Calls and echolocation at Lime Kiln. The first group seen by Lodie was K pod, with many clear calls at Lime Kiln. The second group seems to be arriving now - and it sounds like J pod.

10:37 am
: K pod has reached the Orcasound hydrophone.

10:48 am
: Lots of sweet K calls on OrcaSound now, and I also heard a single J call a minute ago.

1:36 pm
: Distant calls are continuing at Orcasound.

3:11 pm
: There are very faint calls audible on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. It sounds like the orcas are far away.
Meg McDonald, Vashon Island, WA
~
1:40 pm
: sweet calls & whistles on OrcaSound (just tuned at work, love technology that I can hang out listening to Orca most anywhere I am)
Alisa Lemire Brooks, Shoreline, WA

1:26 pm
: Just got word that calls are heard on OrcaSound hydrophones again - they must be heading back south down west San Juan Island.
Orca Network, Whidbey Island, WA
~
11:45 am
: Still some calls at Orcasound.
Vickie Doyle, Kent, WA
10:4
8 - calls at OrcaSound;
11:31 Orca calls at Lime Kiln;

11:34 - orca calls at Orcasound.
Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia, WA
S16 and other So Resident orca calls and echolocation clicks starting at
9:54 at Lime Kiln. No earlier detections at Orcasound, so this may be K pod heading north. There are fewer and fainter calls now on Lime Kiln (at

10:15
).

The rumors of a
superpod
have been confirmed. For about 45 minutes this morning, orcas paraded by, headed north While some were porpoising their way north either single file or in small groups, others were headed north at slower speeds but in larger groups. In the middle of all the porpoising action, there was a small resting group. Meanwhile, some orcas were lying on their backs, slapping their tails. I believe I saw some Js, some Ks, and some Ls -- too many to count. Some were closer to shore, but others were probably nearly a mile off shore. Later this afternoon I started hearing vocalizations on the OrcaSound hydrophone. It appeared that there were orcas lingering west of Kellett Bluff. A few other orcas were porpoising from the south.

As we journeyed up and over to the west side of
San Juan Island
we discovered a large pod of
15+ killer whales
in
Haro Strait
; all surfacing and traveling in perfect synchronization. We believe this pod was made up of several members from both J and K pods. We were excited at the opportunity of spotting the very NEW (2 day old!) calf from K pod, it was hard to try and get a look as there were so many in the group traveling all together! Very exciting to see! We left the orcas as they continued to travel northbound and made our way to Gooch Island, just over the Canadian border, to find some harbor porpoise!

~10 am
: Forecasting a Super Pod day!!! Another huge group of whales just visited
Eagle Cove
also heading north! (probably 20 mins behind the first group). We viewed at least
30+ whales
(I believe part L's) very playful and exhibiting what I would call sensual behavior! Again, same pattern of multiple breaches off of Granny's Cove, so interesting to view this exact same behavior with each group the last several days. They paused off Eagle Cove, gathered into a tight group, lots of surface time, then started rolling around, doing the whirly-twirly, lots of tail slapping and spy hopping! Finished off with a few cartwheels and partial breaches! They have just passed Eagle Point heading north and are out of view, yet I can still hear them partying...loud blows and slaps on the water! Still not a boat in sight! At one point, a large group of the whales stopped traveling and gathered close together, all fins at the surface like a line up! They went down very briefly, followed by what I perceived to be sensual, tactile behavior, rubbing against each other, almost like caressing one another at the surface, then lots rolling and twirling close together (I call that "whirly twirly") and lots of tail slapping! I could not view a sea snake from my vantage point, but I would imagine that was present based on the behaviors! (
this is a perfect description of a Greeting Ceremony and Superpod - sounds like an amazing morning off San Juan Island! ON
)

Saw them (
J, K & L pods
) at
San Juan county park
(NW San Juan Island). Amazing site this morning. Some of them moved through swiftly despite the annoying boaters getting too close. Some stuck around the kelp beds for awhile. Breaches and tail slaps aplenty. Amazing. Really amazing.

Eagle Pt
, heading very slowly north toward Pile Pt, in resting lines and groups.
*
~
7 am
: [
Orcas
] passing
Eagle Cove (SW San Juan Island
) right now! Large, frisky pod of at least 20+ whales close in to shore heading north. Lots of breaching as they passed Granny's Cove (same pattern as last night), tail-slapping and some rolling at the surface. Happy whales and no boats in sight!
