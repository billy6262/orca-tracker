Orca Sightings for July 27, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We left for our
2pm trip
with news that a group of
transients had been spotted in the morning on the South side of Active Pass
. By the time we reached them they were cruising up the east shore of Valdes Island, spread out in a search for seals! We got there just in time to witness 2 kills of Harbor seals and some celebratory activity. In total we witnessed at least 3 kills, 4 spyhops and 4 breaches. We later identified the 4 whales as
T101, T101A, T101B and T102
, which we were excited to discover, as the last time these whale were in the area was for their famous visit to Stanley Park. Great to see the transients again and a beautiful summer day on the water!

4:30
- I'm on
Protection Island
(west of Port Townsend) doing some volunteer work with NOAA and WDFW, and
5 transients
just showed up on the west side of the island to charge the harbor seals hauled out on the beach. They hung out for 15-20 minutes, lobtailed a bit, then took off south. I think there may have been a little guy with them, couldn't quite tell for sure.

4:45
- They're back, and there's definitely a baby. Looks like they just chomped a harbor seal, lots of seabirds circling.

4 pm
- We just watched
6 Orca
hunting harbor seals on Kanem & Violet points (
Protection Is
). There were 3 lunges for shore and one seal corralled by at least 5 Orca! The group had one large male and two small Orca of about 1/3rd of the size of the large male. They were heading east when last seen.
