Orca Sightings for July 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
The glassy conditions of the water allowed us to easily spot over half of the resident
Minke
population, which had gathered in
Salmon Bank
. It was incredible to view so many of the rorquals in one area. We could hear the exhales of the whales between the squawks of the birds which had also congregated in the area. Both the Minkes and the birds were there to feed on the same morsel, the herring.

We rounded Cattle Point and headed up the west coast (
San Juan Isl
). We quickly encountered
orcas
which appeared to be feeding with thrashing and direction changes along with a few breaches and tail lobs. After being lucky enough to watch the unique behavior, we headed back south. Trip 2: We headed south with word that there were killer whales heading towards
False Bay
. Shortly after, there were spouts in the distance. It was
J-pod
! After seeing the first spouts, dorsal fins came up from all directions. One male was identified as Blackberry. The pod was changing direction, coming together, and then splitting apart again. A few of them were lob tailing and spy hopping as well!

This afternoon from
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
we watched two groups of whales come across
Haro Strait
from Discovery Island. They were very spread out by the time they reached
San Juan Island
, and they slowly moved north past Lime Kiln from about

1:45 -
5:15 PM
. The back-lighting made it hard to get IDs, but J8, J16, and J34 were all in this group. The whales never disappeared from view to the north, and their blows were visible for a long time before they passed the lighthouse again heading south at
8:00 PM. This time the closest group to shore included the J17s (J17, J28, J35, J44, J46, J47).
