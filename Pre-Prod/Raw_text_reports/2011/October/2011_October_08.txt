Orca Sightings for October 8, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Resident Orcas just north of Lime Kiln!
We also encountered
a Mother & Calf Humpback Whale in Haro Strait
as well as a large number of Dall's Porpoise, all within 2 miles of each other:) What a wonderful day to be on the water!

We were on the west side of San Juan Island south of
Lime Kiln, north of False Bay
, about a mile from shore.
A single male resident orca
surfaced. Solo. We could not see any other whales for quite some time. The boat moved further north, then we began to see what looked like two females. While sitting with the engine off, after about 20 minutes, a female off our bow started slapping her pectoral fin. Over and over she slapped. Almost as if waving to us. She kept this up for several minutes. I am not sure just how many orcas there were. They were all very s p r e a d out. None were breaching. It seemed like heavy duty prey finding. There was a reports of
Humpback whales
3 miles from us - closer to Canada. Off we went. There were a few other boats already on scene.
Two humpbacks were swimming side by side
in sync with each others movements.
Another whale was solo
. I kept expecting a fluke. Sure enough, when I was not looking, Shelly saw the tail. We stayed with these whales about 20 minutes. Then we turned and started homeward - southish. The orcas were still in the same area.

The weather was better than expected, the water was calm, and the
resident orcas
surprised us late this afternoon when they slowly headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
. There was more foraging activity today than I have seen in a while - the orcas lingered near
Mitchell Bay
for more than an hour. Foraging for the grown-ups means playtime for the wee ones, especially little J47. He was busy splashing, rolling, checking out the kelp beds, and spyhopping.

We had
4 transients around

in
Monterey Bay
. They were first milling about and there were birds hovering around the area. They then traveled a bit north and stopped and nabbed a sea lion. We left at
