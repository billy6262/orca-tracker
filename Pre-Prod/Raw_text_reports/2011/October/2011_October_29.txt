Orca Sightings for October 29, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We followed
J-pod past Discover Isl
all the way west of Trial Isl and they were still moving west. K-pod was even further west. There were some L's out there I think plus at least
2 Humpback Whales
.

We knew the orcas (
J pod plus others perhaps
) had been heard on the
Port Townsend hydrophones
this
morning
. We headed off the dock from Friday Harbor at noon on the Western Prince. We were hoping to find the whales somewhere in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We motored out to Hein Bank and still hadn't seen anything, so we figured we would shut down and throw in the hydrophone. AND then BOOM! Orca vocals as clear as bell right we we turned on the hydrophone! But WHERE WERE THEY??? We looked and looked and then Chris finally spotted them about
2 1/2 miles west of Hein Bank going west
. AMAZING! We spend a good chunk of time with
J34, J22, J38, and J32
. And then, just by luck, I looked over my other shoulder and we had
two humpbacks
off the OTHER side of our boat about 300 yards away! It was the humpback known as "Split Fin" and another adult. Orcas on one side and humpbacks off the other! What an incredible "last trip of the season"!

I have a late second hand report of [probable]
transients near Chambers Bay in the south sound
from saturday about 11-12. A coworker thought she saw 2 whales harrasing sealions on the big buoy near the Chambers Golf Course.

This sketchy report backs up another sketchy but very similar report from about the same time just a few miles away:
*
2-3 Orcas
travelling north in the Tacoma Narrows by Point Defiance Park at approximately

11:30 am
.

Orcas
were heard on
PT hydrophone heading north at 9am
