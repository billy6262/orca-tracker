Orca Sightings for October 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We left the dock with no sightings reported then ended up with
a Super pod and 2 humpbacks
! We arrived on scene approximately

12:45
. The whales, members of all three pod spread out across Haro Strait as they came south around
Turn Point
. I managed to ID the following whales from my pictures:
K26 Lobo, K14 Lea, K42 Kelp, K20 Spock, K38 Comet, L84 Nyssa, L5 Tanya, J28 Polaris, J46 Star, J17 Princess Angeline and possibly J30, J14, & J45
. I am quite sure that we also saw K44. We had great vocals as well. Lots of foraging going on. Just as we were about to leave Captain Ivan spotted huge splashes to the North; possibly breaching Humpbacks!! We headed up to Pender Bluffs and watched two humpbacks surfacing with nice fluke up dives, one cartwheel and a few pec slaps. My favorite was an extended fluke up or headstand, whatever you want to call it. We watched these two amazing animals from

2:15 to
2:40
before heading back to Friday Harbor. Looking at the pictures of the "Head Stand series" still amazes me! Super Tuesday!
