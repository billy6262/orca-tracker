Orca Sightings for October 2, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Soon it was time to go visit the
orcas
, and we were lucky enough to see
L2 Grace, L5 Tanya, L78 Gaia, L54 Ino, L100 Indigo, L108 Coho, L117
(un-named until next year), and of course my favorite
L88 Wavewalker
! L88 set about doing some serious fishing near
Kellett Bluff
while another whale spyhopped nearby. The water was flat calm, and the blows as whales foraged echoed over the water. Meanwhile, under water the orca symphony was in full swing as the whales talked amongst themselves.

Just before
6pm
, sitting in my house at
Eagle Point
I heard the beautiful whoosh sound of their breathing, loud enough through the closed double-pane windows that I knew they had to be very close to shore. As I was getting up to get my camera, I heard a thunderous splash. And just as I opened my door to begin taking photos, one of the [
orcas
], which I lovingly call our "floating pandas," bolted up into the air completely out of the water, in a full sideways-oriented second breach right in front of me, as if to say hello (it's fun to artificially personalize these things!). The whole pod spent about 15 minutes foraging at Eagle Point before heading northwest. There was at least one youngster with them. Whales were here at Eagle Point several times on Thursday and Friday (9/29 and 30), and were also at Lime Kiln at sunset on Friday evening, between
6:30 and
7:30pm. It's always a joy to be close to these creatures, and as the season wanes, I feel a particular good fortune to have what is one of the last encounters for many months

From

10:29 am until
11:30
the same 9 whales (as on
October 1, see below) came north past Lime Kiln lighthouse. They continued north, spread out, but not as spread as yesterday. They made it to
Kellett Bluff
and foraged for quite a while. Then they turned and came back south at about

3:00pm
, the last ones passing
Lime Kiln lighthouse
at about

4:00pm
. Again there were two distinct calls on the Orca Sound hydrophones that clearly sounded like K pod calls. However, there were only the 9 L pod whales present.

Yes, we saw
orca whales
today on the 2nd of October - late in the whale watching season. We took off from Friday Harbor, San Juan Island heading north toward Spieden Island. We pushed on to Haro Strait and started south down Henry Island to the west side of San Juan Island. We were a bit south of
Kellett Bluff
and north of Lime Kiln Point when orca whales came into view. It was
part of L pod
that we were viewing. We sat for about 40 minutes watching the orca pursuing fish. Surfacing for air, switching directions back and forth the whales did this the entire time we sat there. Capt. Mike put down the hydrophone and there was some whale calls that could be heard. Light calling - not a lot. As we headed further south on the west side, some Dall's porpoise started riding our bow. Brief, but what a treat. What made this trip so enjoyable for me was that every guest on the boat seemed interested in anything Shelly or I could tell them about the area, birds, trees and wildlife. This is the last daily tour of the season for us and what a trip it was.

Went to
Lagoon Pt
. looking for the Southern Residents exiting Admiralty Inlet, finally saw a few distant orcas in the fog, spread out between Admiralty Head & Pt Townsend, heading N at
1230
. From

12:45 to
1:15 J pod and some K's and L's
travelled out of
Admiralty Inlet
, mostly spread out and moving steadily northward. Some J pod and K's, about 20+ orcas, took the unusual route into Admiralty Bay south of the Keystone ferry terminal, and came out in a frisky mood and at a rapid clip within 100 yards of shore at Admiralty Head. Some breaches, spyhops, taillobs, etc. By 1 pm, the leaders were nearing Pt. Partridge, coming closer in.

1:30 pm
