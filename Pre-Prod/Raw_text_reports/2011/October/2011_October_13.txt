Orca Sightings for October 13, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went down the east side of
San Juan Island
stopping a few times to view birds and harbor seals. We started up again heading north. Further north up the west side we saw
a male orca solo
. We encountered
a few more orca whales
. I remember a group of 3, either all females or females with a young male. The whales were not coming out of the water - just enough to breath. There were
many small groups
of whales and seemed to be spread out over a large area. With the engines off and the hydrophone down (50') we were treated to the
whale calls/song/clicks
. I can never grow tired of this. At one point, there was a whale that looked as though it was on a direct path toward our boat. We moved a bit more north where different whales were seemingly on a northern journey. Again, with engines off, we sat just staring to the coast of San Juan Island where whales were popping up and sliding back down. We even saw 2 tail slaps that looked like a juvenile. While we were all watching the starboard side whales, a small group of whales went past our port side. The legal viewing limit for whales is 200 yards. Our captains tend to err on the side of caution, but one can always be caught off guard.

3:00 pm:
Still hearing vocalizations on the
OrcaSound
hydrophone. I believe there are orcas foraging in the general vicinity of
Kellett Bluff
. They remained in that area for a while, then headed north. Possible IDs:
J2, J17 and J44, J35 and J47, K13, K20
, at least four of the five J14 family group (J14, J30, J37, J40, J45). I believe these are members of the J14 family group, but my ID skills are limited.

2:06 pm:
Another group of
orcas
northbound, a mile or more off shore.

1:22 pm:
Orcas
continuing to trickle north toward
Kellett Bluff
, most more than 0.5 mile off shore, but others closer to shore. I see K20 in the mix. Some lingering to forage. Have been hearing vocalizations on the nearby
OrcaSound
hydrophone.

12:57 pm
:
One orca
northbound. Looks like J2 Granny. She lingered for a while to forage near
Mitchell Bay
. Nearby OrcaSound hydrophone is quiet.

12:20 pm:
Resident calls
on the OrcaSound hydrophone. Maybe all three pods.
