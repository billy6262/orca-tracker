Amy Carey of Vashon Island called with an update - the
So. Resident orcas turned around and made another close pass by Pt. Robinson
, SE Vashon Island at about

3:50 pm
heading north. She said the whole day has been a breach & tail slap fest, and she has seen salmon leaping out of the water as well, so it sounds like they're getting some good food down there!
*

2:20 pm - Just passing gold beach still southbound
. Oodles of whales...makes me very happy.

Amy Carey called around

2:30 pm
to report MANY whales - at least 2 pods (we're pretty sure we saw J27 on KOMO's video last night), breaching like crazy
as they pass Vashon Isl
. southbound. She said
a group of 4 or 5 swam 20' off the beach at Pt. Robinson, speed-swimming and creating a wave as they went by
, to the delight of a dozen young kids and many adults ~
*
A huge pod of Orcas passed down the east side of Vashon, (around 25 whales), rounding Pt Robinson around
1:30 or 2 pm
. I was able to see very clearly an unusual saddle patch, like a lightening bolt through it, but cannot find an ID page of saddle patches so I might identify it. I saw spy hopping and breaching, as well as
"speed swimming" in tandem with 4 whales at the surface.
This was so close in and a spectacular display! My thanks to Amy Carey for alerting me- it was certainly the most incredible display I have ever witnessed!

Ann Cordova Wilson posted a great phone video of the
incredible romp of orcas past Pt. Robinson
on Vashon Island.

Many Orca off of Pt Robinson on Vashon Island
right now

1:30 heading South
. My girlfriend is over there and said a mother pushed her very young baby out of the water to show the people on shore..LOL. They have been
back and forth between Vashon and Alki all morning..and around Bainbridge, then between Blake Island and Southworth
...Love this time of year ...

We saw
a couple orcas from the Bremerton-Seattle ferry
this morning! Around

9:15 off Alki Beach

8:37 am - Several orcas northbound between Alki Point and Blake Island
, close to the south end of Bainbridge. I only saw 4-5, though; from earlier reports, sounds like they could be pretty spread out in the area.

Lots of
orcas on the
7:55 crossing from Bainbridge Island
. Very spread out, but lots of breaching. Looks like they're heading South closer to the Bainbridge side. Awesome start to the morning.
