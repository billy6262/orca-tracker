Orca Sightings for October 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
~15-20 orcas
right off the
Tsawwassen ferry terminal
(south of Vancouver BC) this morning as the Spirit of Vancouver Island came into dock at

9:30 a.m.
Very spread out but one male (with two others -- female and juvenile?) was very close in between the ferry dock and the DeltaPort container shipping terminal. Seemed mostly to be females / juveniles.

Our Desolation Sound guided flotilla spotted 6
-7 Orcas in Malaspina Strait
(northeast Georgia Strait) at approximately
1145
. The whales were never close enough for us to get a good ID photo, but there appeared to be at least one large male in the group. They were first sighted near McRae Islet off of Stillwater Bay (49 44.235 N, 124 18.638 W). Somewhere between there and Cockburn Point, the Orcas dove. We lost sight of them and the next time we could account for them they had crossed the strait and were closer over to the Texada Island side.

A bit cooler with sun trying to break through clouds, fairly calm water with a less than 2' ebbing tide made for a pleasant sighting of
a Humpback Whale
! First spotted off of
San Juan Island Hannah Heights
at about

1:15pm
, heading across
Haro Strait at
2:05pm
. The whale seemed to be foraging, zigzagging back and forth, near shore then more toward Hein Bank and Canada. Also saw Dall's Porpoise, perhaps socializing with the Humpback? Nice to see more Humpbacks visiting the Salish Sea!

We were out on Sunday the 2nd looking for whales and we came upon
one, maybe two humpbacks
, 1.8nm east of Seabird Point on
Discovery Island
(east of Victoria) traveling slowly southwest. Wonderful experience out in the fog.
