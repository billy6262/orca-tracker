Orca Sightings for October 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
From

4:45pm until sunset
there were
9 L pod whales
along the west side of
San Juan Island
. Two had gone a good distance north past Lime Kiln lighthouse. Gaia L-78 and Grace L-2. Wave Walker L-88, Ino L-54 and 10 month old L-117 didn't quite make it to the light when they turned back sown island. Tanya L-5 and Coho L-108 were spotted as L-54 and L-117 were coming back south. About a mile to the south were Nyssa L-84 and Indigo L-100. During my listening time, one call I heard sounded like a K pod call, but no K pod whales were present.

Ranger Tess and family report that they watched a large pod of Orcas pass by
Possession Point State Park
traveling north at
2100
. Since it was so dark we don't have many details to share but we could hear them for about a half and hour. It appeared to be two groupings that seemed to be about 20 or so whales. The first group went by and as we were trying to determine their exact location another group rounded the point as close as 20 foot off shore. One male was visible traveling in the middle of the group. We heard a few tail slaps, an occasional breach, and it seemed like one call. Very impressive!

- Now appears they are headed east towards
everett
. Can barely spot them from
Pt. No Point
now. Last sighting almost looked like they were heading up around the east end of Whidbey island.

5:30 pm
- Watching them just south from Pt. No Point :)

I watched them for an hour and a half in a boat from Bush Point to
Double Bluff
, Whidbey Island. They continued south and will probably spend the night off Seattle. Could head north tomorrow. It was
J and K pods and part of L pod
. About 80 whales according to the whale watch naturalist that was with me.

We got down to the preserve about

4:50
and saw
one male, a female and young one
hugging close to the female. They kept foraging north, then south, then north, then south with the male off on his own further out. At one point they all came together, a couple more in the mix and there was a lot of under water lunging activity. I was thinking it was a seal kill, when I was thinking these were T's...just after that behavior, the big Male broke off again and headed west (which we last saw him mid channel
Haro at
6:45
when we left), the others moved steadily south. And out from the activity heading north, a pod of 6-8 Dall's porpoise!

Sighting off of
Bush Point
on Whidbey Island at approximately

15:10
, it seemed like two separate pods as they were not right together. I captured pictures and it seems that the 1st Pod had about 6-7 Orca's The second Pod had 6.

At

a
single male orca
was at
Beachy Head

From

11:45 to
16:40
, at least
4 humpbacks
were hanging out about 2 miles south of
Race Rocks
. I did not see any humpbacks breach in this time period. At about
16:30 one of them was occasionally putting its pectoral fin into the air but not slapping it down.
