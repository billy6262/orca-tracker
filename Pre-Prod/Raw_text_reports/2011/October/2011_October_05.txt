Orca Sightings for October 5, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pretty sure what I saw this afternoon, was a pod of
humpback whales
southbound in
Swanson Channel
. There was several boats with them, not the usual whale watching boats though, but definitely watching them. Let me know if anyone else did.

maybe humpbacks?
) just went by beddis rock,
Pender island
, heading towards Trincomali. Just wondering if anybody else saw them?
