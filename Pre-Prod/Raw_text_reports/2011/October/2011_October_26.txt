Orca Sightings for October 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
At around
4pm a group of about 10 or more Orcas
were in the main channel off of
Shilshole
. There was at least one male but they were too far off for photos. They came south about as far as discovery park from what I could tell before turning back north. A couple of small commercial fishing boats pursued and were way to close, within 100 yards.

16+ orcas heading south from Possession Sound

Just wanted to share..... around

3:45
, I, and dozens of other folks, witnessed an entire
Pod of Orcas swimming north bound between Whidbey and Mukilteo Lighthouse Park
. Both adult and young wales were seen. I've lived here 46 years and this is the first time I've seen Orcas off Mukilteo. An amazing sight!!

- Jim called Orca Network to report
2-3 orcas heading north off North Edmonds
.
I saw them, it was incredible from the ferry boat, they were heading south
along the whidbey side in front of clinton going towards Possession Pt.
as the ferry was coming into Clinton, came in front and then alongside the ferry. It was awesome! I was on the 4
:30 boat from Mukilteo to Clinton
...and at that time they came across the front of the ferry going south as we were approaching the dock. There were another pod spread out somewhat that had already were on their way south.
