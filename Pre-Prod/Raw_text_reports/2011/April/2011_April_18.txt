Orca Sightings for April 18, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Possibly heard what sounds like some distant [
orca
] whistles on the
Port Townsend hydrophones
at around

9:55 pm
, but ship noise making it difficult to really hear them. By 10 pm it was definite - we were hearing LOUD and boisterous Transient orca calls! They continued for at least half an hour.

Howard Shippey "saw
two orcas
last
night
off Moolack Beach! They were fairly far off the beach, and moving north with some speed, but with 10X binocs I could see them clearly ... spouts, dorsal fins, color ... one large and one smaller ... how cool!!!" Mooloch Beach is just north of Yaquina Head (near
Newport, OR
). Orcas have been seen in this general area in past years around Tax Day (
April 15) also.

~4-5 orcas
at

6:50 pm
heading south in
Admiralty Inlet
between Ebey's Landing, west/central Whidbey Island, and Protection Island. hmm - possibly one of the Transient pods from the past few days?

We finally found
Transients
hanging out southeast of
Hein Bank
. And it was so amazing. Two family groups, the
T49As
and the
T49Bs
were traveling together, and they seemed to be almost out for a "casual swim". Normally with Transients we'll see 3-4 quick surfacings and then down for a long interval up to 6 minutes. Well, these guys would come to the surface very leisurely about 8-9 times, then go down for 4 minutes, and repeat. They were highly non-directional, one minute popping up 400 yards away and moving away from us, and then they'd turn underwater and show up passing our stern. For a lot of the trip, we were shut down so we could listen to their blows and discuss Transients vs. Residents, life histories, and more. It was such an amazing encounter that we were sad to have to end the trip.

I found the
T049A's and B's with T075B and T075B1
southeast of
Hein Bank
early this
afternoon
after following up Jeanne Hyde's shore sighting in the morning. They tracked to
Eastern Bank
where they then split up into two groups and each group killed a harbor seal.

7:45 a.m. transient calls
began coming over the
OrcaSound
hydrophones (NW San Juan Island) and then later over the Lime Kiln Hydrophones. I spotted whales on the far side of
Haro Strait
, closer to Vancouver Island side at about

8:30a.m.
They continued south and then turned east toward San Juan Island, turning south again at about mid-strait. They continued in a down island manner until they again moved over closer to San Juan Island. I last saw them at

10:30a.m.
, some close to shore, less than 1/2 mile south of Pile Pt. and another group off shore, heading away from the island. On Maya's Westside Charters in the
afternoon
, we found, who I believe were the
same transients
that I saw in the morning. This time we encountered them in the area of Eastern Bank. There were a total of 9 whales:
T49As, T49Bs, T75Bs, and T75C.
We left them in the same area spread out and they appeared to be socializing. During our time there we did not see any clear signs of any kills being made.

I'm hearing some interesting
calls
on the
OrcaSound
hydrophone. I heard the first calls at about
8 am
. I'm guessing these are transient calls, but I don't believe I've heard these particular calla before.

(report received at

6:30 pm
) We had just got down to the boat when it was reported to us that a
gray whale
had just headed out of our bay (
Port Ludlow
) and was heading out into Admiralty Inlet. Apparently it had been swimming around the coast guard buoy for a while.

You have
gray whales
in your back yard (
Saratoga Passage
, North Bluff, N. of Greenbank). Peg and I saw one roll and two spouts today between
0640 and 0700
.

I, along, with a curious seal observed a small group/pod? of
harbor porpoises
[best guess] Just outside the green bouy; off
Penn Cove's Snakelum Point
.
*
Orca Network received a call from Jim Hodgeson, WA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife pilot, who reported seeing a huge group of
California sea lions
in
Penn cove
at

11:15 am
. He stopped counting individuals when he got to 50, and estimated there were
70 - 80
total, all swimming and diving in one big group.
