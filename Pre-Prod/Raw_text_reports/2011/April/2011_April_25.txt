Orca Sightings for April 25, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
10am - 2.30pm
we had approx. 10 orcas off Cleland Island, NW of
Tofino, Vancouver Island, B.C.
We left them in a resting line, 3 miles offshore heading south east. No ID's.

A Pod - Northern Residents
. Bill T. was walking his dog down close to the water around
10 pm
south of
Powell River
close to Myrtle Rocks when there were a number of blows. Since it was so dark and his dog was afraid of this unrecognized sound, he could not get closer for a count on the exact number of whales, but based on the reports, we can only assume it was the same pod known as the A5s. They were very slowly moving southward, almost drifting with the tide.

We had reports of J-pod out towards Victoria and heading West into the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
. Pretty soon the whales were up ahead. Somewhere between 10 and 14 members of
J-pod
was consistently swimming southwest with short down times. We watched for a few minutes when a few of them suddenly switched direction and became more active. A juvenile breached a few times, followed by others tail slapping and rolling on their sides. We watched the activity for about 30 minutes before we headed towards home.

Nice to see the familiar fins of
J pod
again! We found them near
beaumont shoal
close to the
Victoria
waterfront. We spent time with J27 and a youngster, maybe J45, playing. There were a few others around the area too but couldn't get any ID's, water was a bit choppy.

I can identify what I believe is T075C and T075B1 in these photos.
