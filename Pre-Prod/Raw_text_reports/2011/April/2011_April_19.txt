Orca Sightings for April 19, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was flying up to Oak Harbor and spotted
a gray whale
feeding in front of
Fox Spit
on
Whidbey Island
, at

5:25 PM
. When I was flying back down the Island the gray whale was still there at
6:10 PM! I headed down to Everett and found another
gray whale
feeding near the marine marker northeast of
Hat Island
and west of Everett.

I was at
Camano
Island State Park today around
noon
(For a Salmon TAG site visit!) when I caught a
Gray whale
spout just west of
East Point, Whidbey Island
. I watched for about half an hour while it gradually moved around the point and south along the shore. The timing sounds like it was probably the Gray you saw.

Report of 6 [
orcas
] near the beach at Point White on
Bainbridge Island
is VERY interesting. When I was a kid we lived just north of Point White. There were rubbing rocks at Point White [about 300 yards north of the point] where orcas came in to rub. My dad saw them doing this as early as 1907 and I saw them as a kid in the 1950's.

4:19
Broomgerrie Beach on
Bainbridge Island
. Alerted by neighbors Ben & Nadine Benson that there was a pod of
Orcas
near our house. There seemed to be 6. They were breaching, lob-tailing, changing directions and enjoying swimming towards Elliot Bay.

Powell River/Sunshine Coast, BC reports from Whales & Dolphins of BC:
4 Orca
spotted by Grief Point,
Powell River
. They appeared to be in stealth mode, disappearing for long periods of time. They were close in to shore heading towards Beach Gardens Marina. One larger male and one juvenile in the mix. I watched to see if they'd come closer to Westview, but nothing till too dark. Since we've had around the same number for the past few days in the area, they may be Transient (meat eating) Killer Whales that have found a food source too good to leave.
A FB friend, Laila, gave me this site after seeing a couple photo's I took of
3 Orca's
while at the Beachgarden's in
Powell River
today. They were heading south. I think I may have seen the big male you mentioned. He is huge. From Wendy P.

On the Western Prince at about

1:30 pm
we encountered many transient orcas attacking a Steller sea lion just south of
Patos Island lighthouse
.
T36
and a couple juveniles were off, while others were in the fray just a few hundred yards to west. The whales identified were members of the
T36s, T99s, T65As, and T123s
. The largest male, among all of these whales, was a sprouter T123A. It appeared to be a training session with groups taking turns attacking the sea lion. When we left the scene the Steller sea lion was still alive. About two miles away and approaching the general area of the whales and the sea lion, were more whales. Identified in this group were
T101, T101A, T101B and T102
.

We had managed to discover approximately
15+ Transients
1.5 miles SW of the
Patos lighthouse
and they were in definite hunting mode. The focus of all this attention was a Steller Sea Lion. He spent much of his time vertical with his head down to help him see the attacks coming, but with so many orcas, he wasn't winning the battle. The whales would act like they were leaving, only to suddenly turn back and take turns hitting the Steller. Even the younger calves got in on the action. Lots of lunges, a few breach-like aerial assaults. It was like an episode of Wild Kingdom. After an hour, we began to leave, only to discover yet
another group of Transients
! They weren't part of the hunting group, and instead were about 3/4 of a mile west of the group, kind of hanging out. As if they could hear all the amazing vocalizations and knew what was going on, but weren't invited to the "party."

Orcas
yesterday from South Beach,
Bainbridge Island
; looking toward Manchester. Whales swimming north at about

18:10
. Looked like 5, one looked very young.
nplus1, Bainbridge Island, WA
*
Appears to be about five to six
orcas
,

5:15 pm
- current (

6:15
) pm, Yeomalt Point,
Bainbridge Island
, about 500 yards from shore. Seem to be playing. No large fins, however, one baby in this group! Baby surfaces with adult, baby does some tail splashing, baby does tail splashing with body in backwards position (belly up). Adults doing some rolling to the sides. Small metal fishing boat (not sure, but think # was WN1289NY) approached slowly and took photos with cell phone. Orcas remained in area after boat went by.

5:15 pm: 6 orca
at point white on
Bainbridge island
. Close to the beach circling and looks like they are hunting seals. Probably transients.

6:05 pm: 6 orca are frolicking off Yeomalt Point on Bainbridge island. There are 2 young ones and 4 adults but no obvious mature males in this group. They are swimming and circling and have been at it over an hour now. close to the beach and seems like they are feeding...cannot tell on what but there are seals and sea lions around lately.

Ivan on Western Prince just found ~

WA State ferries reports at least
1/2 dozen orca
s off
Kingston
, near Appletree Cove, at

1:03 pm
.
*
I saw the pictured
Orcas
off of
Point No Point
Lighthouse near Hansville at

10:00am
, then again at
11:03am in Eglon (between Pt. No Point and Kingston, Kitsap Peninsula, WA).

WA State Ferries called at

10:32 am
to relay a report from a ferry captain of a pod of
orcas
near the
Southworth/Vashon
ferry lane, just milling non-directional. Probably the same ones that were at Hansville at
7:30.
*

7:50 am
: I saw pod of
4 or 5 Orcas
off the entrance to Hood Canal on Skunk Bay headed towards
Point No Point
Lighthouse area and following the Kitsap Peninsula shoreline. It could be the Transients. I didn't notice any large males but did notice smaller smaller fins, maybe an older baby . They stayed close to each other with lots of tail slapping and general messing around. They kept heading east without any milling back and forth.

We are seeing
4-5 orcas
right outside our house located off the tip of
Hansville, WA
, since

7:15 am
. They are playing and having a great time. Coming clear out of the water completely, I believe they are stunning the bait fish. spanking their tails. They are located between Skunk Bay and Point no Point but more towards Skunk Bay about 300 yards from shore - definitely not in the shipping lanes!

4:30 p.m.
,
3 gray whales
traveling in a tight group east along the bluff from
Baby Island
area and rounded the bend heading toward Langley. They were very close too shore but weren't feeding.

Tom spotted
two gray whales
in
Holmes Harbor
at the north end of
Beverly Beach
about

2:30
this afternoon. They spouted and rolled, heading north. Heather, who lives just south of us, said she saw 3--she thinks two adults and a youngster.

At

12:05 pm
I looked out our office/sunroom window to see a [
gray whale
] spout in
Saratoga Passage
, between Elger Bay and East Pt. At
1 pm
, the whale was just off East Pt, continuing south mid-channel. At around

5:10 pm
I saw three spouts in Saratoga Passage, mid-channel between Camano Island and the entrance to Holmes Harbor, moving closer to Camano. By
5:30 pm, one of the whales had headed N toward Elger Bay, and the other two appeared to be continuing south. Though we typically have only adult Grays in Saratoga Passage, one of the spouts did appear much smaller than the other two.

We saw
Patch and Little Patch
off the south end of Hat from

11:30-
1:30
or so today.

We observed a lone
gray whale
at

11:35
in the north west part of
Port Ludlow Bay
about 100 yards offshore just adjacent the Admiralty Condominiums. It was hard to judge its size but probably 30 - 35 foot. This was right at a -2.0' low tide and we estimate it was swimming in 40-50 foot of water. Begining location estimated to be 47°-55'-28.0"N & 122°-40'-46"W traveling slowly to the NW. It surfaced every 4 - 6 minutes, blowing 3 - 4 times before diving. It appeared to be probably feeding. Unable to get good visuals on markings except for one more prominent light patch (not nearly as large as Patch's [#49] and further forward) on its upper left side below the dorsal hump and a white/light marking on the tip of the right fluke. It was exhibiting very leisurely feeding/surfacing activity and only on the final dive of each sequence were the knuckles and flukes even partially visible. In a little over an hour we observed the whale travel NW for about 0.75 - 1.0 miles and then return about 0.5 miles slightly further offshore, apparently milling around.

Connie Barrett on
Camano Island
just called at

10:52 am
to say she's watching at least
two gray whales
in
Saratoga Passage
out in the middle of the 4-mile wide expanse between Camano and Whidbey Islands, off Cama Beach, not traveling, just milling (or possibly feeding in deep water if there are large patches of krill).
