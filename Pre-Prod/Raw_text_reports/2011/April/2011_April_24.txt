Orca Sightings for April 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca off Annabon Island, Equatorial Guinea - off the coast of West Africa (-1.4050, 5.6131 - Gulf of Guinea, off the NW coast of Annabon Island, Equatorial Guinea). I was taking a boat tour around Annabon Island, when we spotted
three Orcas
north of our boat at
11 am
local time. We moved closer and followed them for 10 minutes. There appeared to be two adults and a juvenile. We turned back toward the island and saw
another large Orca
also swimming north. It was a real treat to see these whales on the Equator!

We spotted a pod of
orcas
about

10:00 a.m.
that swam north to south just off the west shore (about 60 yards) of Sinclair Island in the
San Juans
. There were at least six, but difficult to count. They then circled for a long time off the north side of Cypress Island east of Towhead Island. In 30 years on Sinclair Island, we have never seen the whales come to that side of Rosario Strait.

Kim Allen called to report seeing four groups of
orcas
off Tide Pt,
Cypress Island
at

11:40 am
. They were heading south down Rosario Strait, close to Cypress Island.

Around

1:15pm
, my husband and I spotted an
Orca pod
between Lyle Point (Anderson Island) and the Green Marker at the mouth of the Nisqually River,
South Puget Sound
. We witnessed at least three adults and one calf. They were surrounding and herding a harbor seal I would assume in an attempt to teach the calf hunting skills. At times they would surface and appear to roll over onto the seal and submerge it as well as rolling to create a wake that would wash the seal around into the path of another pod member. In one instance three adult Orca surfaced simultaneously, forming a perfect triangle shaped corral around the seal then went back down again. We watched them toy with the seal for at least an hour and a half. By the time we left the pod had moved closer to the mouth of Orro Bay (Anderson Island), in their pursuit of the seal, and had begun to breach the water and splash down near or on top of the seal, we couldn't tell which for sure. There did appear to be one Orca with a longer dorsal fin than the rest, a male I assume, and one calf about twice the size of a large porpoise. I also saw three large scar-like marks on the left side of the calf.

My wife and I observed a group of
3 orcas
in
south Puget Sound
at approx

1:45 p.m.
They appeared to be a transient group consisting of one adult female, one juvenile, and one other whale that was either a second adult female or possibly an older juvenile. The whales were ~ 1 mile SE of Johnson Point roughly mid-way between Johnson Point and Devil's Head. We were motoring in our 32 ft sailboat at the time. We stopped and the whales first swam towards us, then passed us and continued to the SE until out of sight.

Some members of
J pod
were located in
Georgia Strait
, heading East, at about
noon
. At first, only 3 whales were seen, and ID'ing them was difficult due to waves, and long dives. Eventually, more whales were sighted near the Pt Roberts lightstation, and we could finally confirm that it was J Pod. J34, Doublestuff, was observed lunging, presumably after a salmon. Then J28, Polaris, was seen milling, with little J46, Star, at her side. The whales were very spread out, from Pt Roberts, to north of the coal docks. They were working the tide lines, doing long dives, and apparently foraging. Some vocals were heard on our hydrophones - such a sweet sound. Approximately 8-9 whales were seen, most too far away to ID.

Pod sighting with approx.
3 orcas
, east side of gibson point fox island (
S. Puget Sound
) heading North around
7pm
.
Lisa and Jay Gray,
*
We found the
orcas
reported earlier, at

3:15 pm
off
West Beach, NW Whidbey Isl
. NE of Smith Island heading south. Looked like a small pod, but so distant we couldn't confirm numbers or get any photos or IDs, so possibly Transients.
*
5-7 orcas
were seen off
West Beach, Whidbey Island
, at
2 PM
, heading south about 2 miles out. The report was called in by Philip Donlay.
*
About
3 orcas
were reported in
Case Inlet, South Puget Sound
, heading SW, at

10:44
this morning
