Ironically I was fishing between
Pt. No Pt. and Pilot
today and saw the
Minke
(solo) circling in about 150 feet of water. There are 1 or 2 virtually everytime I fish Eastern and Hein Bank, they are so common I don't think about reporting them. They are usually in the areas holding large concentrations of shrimp and sandlance which shows on my sonar.
