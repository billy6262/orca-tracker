Orca Sightings for April 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
While flying from Port Hardy to Campbell River at

1:20pm
, I spotting a pod of approximately
half dozen Orca
transiting northwestbound along
Johnson Strait
, 5 miles east of
Robson Bight
, along the south shoreline. At least 4-5 were swimming 'line-abreast', and the remainder was/were approx 100metres off to their right and slightly behind. Also, abeam Chatham Lightstation, approx
1:45pm, we spotted 3 Orca transiting westbound. It appeared to be two larger and one smaller, but I can't confirm that..
