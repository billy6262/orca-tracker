Orca Sightings for April 10, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw at least
9 killer whales
zig-zagging their way east at 44/00 in
Monterey bay
. I believe there were at least 3 males present. Once, the whales popped up about half a mile from us and it looked like they had been harassing
a single gray whale
since the whale was in defense-mode belly-up. The gray didn't appear full grown, possibly a juvenile. The orcas seemed to lose interest and continued east. The gray whale was left looking dazed and confused-- swimming slowly at the surface and taking shallow breaths.

A pod of
orcas
was spotted. It was a great sighting and we were with them about an hour - lots of good views. They were
12 miles NW of Moss Landing CA
on the edge of
Monterey Bay
. We were with them almost an hour. At least two females/one calf and two males. There was a lone gray whale that appeared and went "belly up" for the duration. The orcas buzzed it but then took off eastward towards Moss Landing. The females and males swam in two separate groups the entire time we were with them.
