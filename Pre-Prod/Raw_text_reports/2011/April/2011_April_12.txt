Orca Sightings for April 12, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched two whales below our deck off
Polnell Rd, Oak Harbor
all day. They were here for a while on Tuesday afternoon and night.

We watched many seals and some type of whale out at
Pt No Point (N. Kitsap Peninsula, WA)
east of the light house. Thought a gray but had more of a distinct dorsal fin. Read that there were gray's recently in area. Would like to know what it was. Orca Network sent the link to the photo of the
Humpback whale
reported in Puget Sound from the KING 5 TV website, and Katrina replied: That looks like what we were seeing. Awesome!

After a call from Jerry Mercer on North Bluff Rd., Whidbey Island, at

5:05pm
that a
gray whale
was making its way north in
Saratoga Passage
, I went to the bluff and after a half hour saw a blow about a mile northward. I got a shot of the fluke at about

5:35
and it turned out to be
Patch, #49
.

Two
[gray] whale
spouts were seen from the beach at Crescent Harbor (closest to Crescent Harbor Navy Housing). I spotted them the first time at about

2:40 p.m
. I had the opportunity to watch them again at about

3:50 p.m.
for about 30 minutes. The whales were quite a distance from shore, but there were two distinct spouts that could be seen off and on. They seemed to be gradually making their way north during the time that I was able to watch them.

Between
6:25 and
7:15 pm (while looking for Patch, who I never did see!) I observed
several dozen porpoise
(appeared to be Harbor porpoise) in Saratoga Passage off Hidden Beach north of
Greenbank
. They were traveling in small groups of 3 - 6, mostly heading north, but some heading south. There were also about six California sea lions swimming south mid-passage, rolling around each other, then another one further south, rafting with its head and flipper up, drifting north.

Andrew Beckett called Orca Network at

with a report of at least
2 orcas
, both females (not adult males), off Skiff Pt.,
Bainbridge Island
, headed south toward Yeomalt Pt. and the middle of Puget Sound.
*
4 to 6 Killer Whales
, probably from the same group of
Transients
the other day, were spotted between Rebecca Rocks closer to Harwood Island and heading out towards Vivian Island around

5:30pm.
Their breaching and splashing gave their position away. From John and Joan.
