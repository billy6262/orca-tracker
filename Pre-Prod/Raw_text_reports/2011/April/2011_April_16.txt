We got word that Transient Orcas were over near Salt Spring Island going north. Too far and too chancy, but then we got a call from Simon Pidcock, owner of Ocean Ecoventures, out of Duncan. They had turned south and Mallard was headed that way. We followed and were treated to about
20 Orcas
headed into
Cowichan Bay, BC
.
