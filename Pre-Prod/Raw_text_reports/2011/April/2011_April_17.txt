Orca Sightings for April 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research arrived on scene just north of East Point (48째 47.08 N; 123째 02.51 W) at

12:15 p.m
. The
transients
, who had been traveling north into the southern
Strait of Georgia
, had just turned around and came charging back out of the tide rip and began some intense milling around Rosenfeld Rock which had 30-40 Steller sea lions on it. There were thousands of Bonaparte's gulls working the tide rips. The whales briefly harassed one sea lion but apparently let it go. A couple whales continued to cruise around the rock while the rest of the whales on the calm side of the tide rip milled around the area in a social kind of way. There was another group of about 10 T's in the area but were on the rough side of the tide rip so we did not make it to them. We ended the encounter at 48째 47.23Np; 123째 02.37 W, around

1:30 p.m.
as the whales turned north again into the sloppy waters of Georgia Strait. The whales photographed by CWR:
T36, T36A, T36A1, T36B, T36B1, T37, T99, T99A, T99B, T99C, T124, T124D, T124E, T137, T137A, and T137B
. Sixteen whales total.
