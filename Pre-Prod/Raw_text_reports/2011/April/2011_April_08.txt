Orca Sightings for April 8, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit and Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research encountered the
T99's,T36's and T37
milling and socializing in Swanson Channel about a mile off Mouat Point,
North Pender Island B.C
.(48째 45.74 N;123째 19.83 W) at
2:30 pm. We had 8 transients
T99,T99A,T99B,T99C,T36,T36B,T36B1 and T37
. After about 45 minutes of milling, tactile behavior the whales spread out in a loose group and headed down Swanson Channel moving inshore toward North Pender. The encounter ended 2 miles west of Bedwell Harbor (48째 44.25 N;123째 15.37 W) at

3:48 pm
.

I came across Transient orcas
T020 and T021 with the T049A's and B's late morning
offshore off
Gordon Head
. They headed south around
Discovery Island
. In the
afternoon T020 and T021
split off and headed south-west out the Juan de Fuca and the others cruised the shoreline of Victoria's waterfront and were last seen off the mouth of Victoria harbour at
1700hrs
.

There were a total of
6 Orca
seen as two groups of 4 and two, by Vivian Island just off of
Powell River
travelling towards the Vancouver Island side of Savary around
5pm
. There was at least one large dorsal and one had an "L" shaped notch on the trailing edge of its dorsal about 5 inches down. We spotted a pod of whales harassing a sea lion, just off the government dock on Savary (Island, BC). We stayed with them from 7 pm until dark, and they spent the whole time circling, bumping and smacking a single sea lion. The sea lion was still alive when we left. There were four orcas - two appeared to be smaller.

4 to 5 Killer Whales
(Orca) milling about by Baker Passage between Hernando and Cortez Islands around 1pm. The report came from a tug boater who passed it on to one of the Campbell River Whale Watching guides who gave me a call on the marine radio - thanks!

We located a group of
transient orcas
in
Swanson Channel, south of Active Pass
at approximately

12:30
, in flat calm water. The group had killed a seal or two just prior to our arrival. They were busily guarding the entrails of their prey from swooping seagulls as we came on scene. The group consisted of females, juveniles and calves that we later ID'ed as the
T36's, T37 and the T99's
. After their meal, the whales were very social, and we were able to listen to some amazing vocals that continued for most of our encounter. The adults T36, T36B, T37 and T99 were observed logging at the surface several times, while the calves and juveniles were extremely social with one another, and about 100 metres from the dozing adults. Between these episodes, the calves would temporarily rejoin with the adults before once again forming into a play group. We were fortunate to observe spyhops, lunges, tail slaps, and tail stands. So much for serious, quiet transients. I love it when the whales have me re-thinking all those generalizations.

Turns out we had a report of
orcas
in
Haro Strait
, so we motored over towards Discovery Island (near Victoria, BC) and we were very lucky to have a chance to see the
T20s, T49As and T49Bs
. They were being a bit "un-transient like" in their behavior today. Lots of surface time, logging, and generally just "hanging out". Then down for 5-7 minutes, only to reappear in a random location (very transient like!) Even from 300 yards away, the whales were impressive, especially T20 and his massive notched fin. The whales appeared content to just "mosey" at a leisurely pace. John Boyd (JB), SSAMN Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor, WA

John Boyd called about two groups of
transients
near
Discovery Island
, east of Victoria, at
1 pm
.

4 orcas
reported from
Port Townsend/Keystone ferry at
11:35 am
, closer to PT side, but heading NE toward Whidbey, reported by David Gluckman - likely the Transients that have been in Puget Sound.
*
Here at
Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Island)
. We observed short snack of
2 grays
, right out front at

1:30PM
today. 4 sailboats were on their line from a distance, so they headed out a ways and meandered southwest, towards Polnell Pt. Put my beach pedestrian shoes on to follow. About 1/4 mile down they stopped and hung out in same place, [300 to 500 feet off sand shoreline] for close to an hour. It was low tide with sand out a ways. Am persuaded they were feeding in deeper water/not shallow; at a drop off where sand ends and ledge to deep water begins. More like a baleen whale would do, coming straight up after being down for 5 minutes or more. Both side by side when surfacing. Witnessed, this about 5 years ago when two gray whales near Polnell Pt. were doing the same. Was out in the boat, at that time and could see tons of stick or kneedle fish in the water, as the whales were feeding. Their spouts today, seemed to be louder than the norm. Really, blasting away in the calm waters. Left them, but at
3:30PM they both came back out front the house, to finish their snack, they had started at
1:30. When sailboats were around. Grays visit ended with them steaming their way towards Polnell Pt. Was treated to lots of diving, rolls, with tails/flukes throughout the afternoon. Great Stuff!!

About
1 PM
spotted one, possibly 2,
Gray whales
feeding in front of our house south of
Mabana
. They were out quite a ways and diving deep in about the same place for about half and hour, presumably feeding. I lost them, but then spotted a single Gray in closer just off Mabana about
2 PM
.

We visited with (
Gray whales) #56 and #723
off of
Camano Island
as two bald eagles soared overhead! They surfaced several times giving us some amazing looks with the island in the background. We spent a lot of time with them and as they got into deeper water, they showed us their flukes a number of times!

Paula Rounds reported
1 Gray whale
off
Polnell Pt, NE Whidbey Island
, traveling east at
noon
today.
*
We spotted
one gray whale
feeding near
Spee-bi-dah
. We first spotted the gray at

8:25am
and watched it travel slowly along the shore, leisurely feeding and churning the water. It went out towards the point, then came back in towards Spee-bi-dah. Around
10:00am we lost sight of him. While watching for blows about then, we spotted a group of porpoises, traveling swiftly north about 1/4 to 1/2 mile off shore in front of Tulalip Shores. They swam along in twos or fours, and then many of them came together at once - perhaps as many as 2 dozen. They separated again and swam further north, again in groups of twos or fours. The porpoises were gray with a dark blunt dorsal fin (harbor porpoise.)

7:45am
.
Another gray whale
joined around

8:00am
and have been feeding. They've been in the same spot for 30mins- it's currently
8:31am. (location: in between Tulalip Shores and Spee-bi-dah.

I looked out the window at

4:50 pm
hoping to see a Gray whale (still), and instead saw 3 - 4 Harbor porpoise off Hidden Beach, N. Greenbank, swimming north in Saratoga Passage (again). But somehow missed seeing the Grays that I KNOW were out there somewhere!

4:00 pm:
A huge dark
gray whale
was lazily feeding at
Point No Point
Lighthouse for over an hour before heading out toward Whidbey. Initially, we were watching more than a dozen sea lions rafting not far from shore. Then further down the beach another 8-10 sea lions feeeding.
