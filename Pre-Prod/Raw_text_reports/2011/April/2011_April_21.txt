I've been enjoying the herd of sea lions in Penn Cove over the last month. In 22 years living on Penn Cove I can't recall ever seeing a pack of sea lions.

This morning somewhere around

7:30 am
, 6 for sure maybe as much as 10
orcas
going east to west between
Eagle island and Anderson island
(47.11'12 N; 122 4.58 W) in Balch Passage, last seen closer to Longbranch. One good size male, could have been as many as 3 juveniles, another 3- 4 mid sized ones. Rather a leisurely swim, rolling - sometimes upside down - actually 3 were just stationary for a few minutes, just floating - took them about 15-20 minutes to swim through the area when first spotted at Eagle island to Otso point, then didn't see them for a long time until they surfaced closer to Longbranch.

I live just south of Hat Island in
Everett
on a bluff. At about

gray
from recent reports.

since last fall here in Case Inlet (
