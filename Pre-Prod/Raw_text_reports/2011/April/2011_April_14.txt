Orca Sightings for April 14, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Island Adventures reports they saw
gray whales #53, and possibly #1105
, one of the "newer" North Puget Sound Grays that has just visited the area the past 3 years.
*
Jim Maya called Orca Network to report
~15ish? Transients
heading north in
San Juan Channel
1 mile north of Turn Island at
1 pm
, then sent this: We were calling last year the Year of the Transient Orca...Now this year is turning out to be it's equal or even better. Transients Orca numbers are INCREASING! Why? Lots of food! It's simple. Once again we had about ten of them. They were first sighted near
Cattle Pass
, then moved up past
Friday Harbor
and then on up to Jones Island.

On Maya's Westside Charters we encountered
transient orcas
as they were traveling north up
San Juan Channel
. They were just outside of
Friday Harbor
and quite close to the entrance. It was the
T49As, T49Bs, T75Bs and T75C
. We left them at the north of Yellow Island, still heading north.

It was about five miles w of
Moss Landing CA
. We were with the
orcas
for several hours - observed a rather speedy sea lion kill by the males. After that the female group came in and they circled about and approached our boat repeatedly. One grabbed a free floating buoy in his mouth. They did several bubble bursts on our boat from directly below us. It looks like the same group we saw this past Sunday.
