Orca Sightings for April 29, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just received third hand information that at approximately

11:30 AM
today there was a brief sighting of
4 orcas
close to Yaquina Head, just north of
Newport OR
. The observers said they were heading south and were out of sight within a short period of time.

At

13:45
paddling from Rat Island toward town we encountered a
gray whale
heading northeast, it fluked and resurfaced West of us. Continued to see it until about

14:30
, it was swimming all around the bay, South to Kala Point, then popped up just a few feet off the NW Maritime Center Pier very near shore as we loaded our boats. Last sighting was headed East around Pt Hudson.

I got really lucky and witnessed 4 or 5 pairs of mother / calf Gray whale combos making their way north very close to shore from above (a pullout on Highway 1 about 400 feet above the ocean just south of
Grimes Point CA
- where there's a sea lion colony on the rocky beach at the base of the cliffs). The whales were in close enough to be able to see them underwater, so thought you might like to see the photos (see above photo of the day, and photo below), which were taken over the course of roughly one hour -

10:30am through
11:30am
or so. One interesting aspect to this is that at one stage, a Risso's dolphin (there was a small pod of them further offshore) came and swam between two whales (that looked to be about the same size - so not sure they were mother /calf), and both whales rolled on to their backs (see photo below), then rolled back on to their fronts again and carried on. Most (if not all) of the combos turned around a couple of times and seemed to hang out in the kelp - rather than just constantly head north - I wondered if that meant they were hiding from predators or something, but I only saw the Risso's in the area, nothing more sinister. Is that normal behavior for the grays?

Connie Barrett of Camano Island called to report two
Gray whales
at

1:30 pm
, mid-channel in
Saratoga Passage
, feeding 300 - 500 feet offshore of Cama Beach State Park. A group of people were on the point, watching from shore.
