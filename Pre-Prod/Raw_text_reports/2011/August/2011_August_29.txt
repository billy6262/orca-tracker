Was fishing for pink salmon when I saw a slower than usual Clipper Ship pass by going south
between LaConnor & Whidbey Island's Strawberry Point
. Decided to follow and was surprised when Clipper came to a stop at
around
5:30PM
. It was a beautiful evening with puffy clouds above Cascades, so I thought the stop was to view the scenery. I noticed a crowd of people, all at the bow and then I saw ORCAS. Clipper let the
6 or 7 orcas
pass by and they were on the move/heading north. Clipper turned around and at slow speed keeping its distance, along with a yacht, a neighbor friend, and myself following Clipper's lead. At bouy entrance to LaConnor, transient orcas stopped to feed. All boats came to a halt and I was next to Clipper Ship watching orcas, with no little excitement when we saw couple of tail splashes. After the short feed on presumed pinks (note: these were likely transients, who eat only marine mammals), they went on their way north. As Clipper and other boats left, I decided to stay and was rewarded when
Orcas did an about face and headed back towards me/going south
. More, feeding as orcas circled, just south of LaConnor entrance, again. Then, off they went northbound towards Hope Island and possibly Deception Pass. Great stuff. When I returned to Strawberry Point where boats were fishing for pinks, another friend told me when orcas passed by to feed, he observed two of the smaller orcas surface at the same time/heads straight up with their mouths wide open. Does it get any better than that?

Nona Hill called at

11:28 am
to report a pod of at least
7 orcas off Sandy Pt, Whidbey Island
, close to the point breaching, tail slapping, and spy-hopping for quite some time, then heading north. Two of the orcas were smaller, one of them very small.
*

12:15 pm: 4 orcas
, including 1 large and 1 small one, were crusing inside
Elger Bay, Camano Island

7:30
- Clipper II just passed another
small group of northbound Ts in Saratoga Passage
, just north of Camano Head.

6:30
- Victoria Clipper III just found
4 transients northbound
at Strawberry Pt in Skagit Bay and followed them to just south of Swinomish Channel. They're moving pretty fast but seem to be hunting as they go.

Orcas heading north in Saratoga Passage
, just north of
Langley
about
noon
. Oh, what a time for a longer lens. At least the whale bell in Langley worked well. Crowds were able to see the parade of fins.

Today we traveled all the way to
Victoria
to see
one lone transient
. He was magnificent. It was a long haul but when we arrived he appeared to be patrolling up and down the rocks. He has one of the broadest dorsal fins I have ever seen. The word on the street was that he had been harassing a sea lion prior to our arrival. When we got there he was just cruising, back and forth along the rocks, occasionally rolling slightly on his side as if he was looking up toward the rocks to see what was on the lunch menu.
