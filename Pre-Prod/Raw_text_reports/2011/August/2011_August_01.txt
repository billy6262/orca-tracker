Orca Sightings for August 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi all-

2:15 pm
from
South Beach
we saw the
L12's
(ID from LK Int. Center) foraging out a couple hundred yards or more. They then headed north, last around False bay at
4:00. Yay! More to come we hope.

L-pod, minke
. Out into the waters off
Salmon bank
, where the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Haro strait meet, we found exactly what we were still holding our breaths for:
L-pod
of the Southern Resident Killer Whales! The pod was spread out near and off shore and
from Cattle Pass up towards False Bay
. It was every whale for itself, with a few being social and in pairs and trios. Some seemed to be traveling, others hunting and one frisky pair may have been mating (was he an outsider from J or K pod?). They were heading south but after thirty minutes of viewing, they all of a sudden went offshore and started traveling north. The visibility was excellent (we could see Mount Rainier and Mount Baker!). We found "bird balls" (high densities of birds sitting on the water, potentially on a ball of bait fish like herring). One bird ball took off all at once and minutes later, we found out why: a
minke whale
had come in to eat their herring!

Courtney Smith called Orca Network to say
J pod
is heading west out the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
this morning from
7 to
7:45 am
. She saw J27, J19 and J41 from Port Angeles with a spotting scope, about ten kilometers from shore.
