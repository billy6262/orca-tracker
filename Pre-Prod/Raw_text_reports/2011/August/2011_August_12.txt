Orca Sightings for August 12, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
"Do whales come up in the fog?" someone asked as passengers on board 'Mystic Sea' enjoyed a thoroughly 'mystic' experience off
Middle Bank, west of San Juan Island
.
Cappucino (K21) and sister Raggedy (K40)
with feisty little
K44 and Mom, Deadhead (K27
) appeared and disappeared through waves of fog.
Mega (L41)
made a fleeting appearance before being enveloped, once again, in the mist.

Looks like K21 is healing nicely? CWR was out there following him and K40 for a while today, hopefully they agree!

We made our way along the
west side of San Juan Island
. Suddenly, someone shouted, "There!" The boat slowed, we turned, we looked, we waited and then: ORCA! One dorsal and then two appeared. They were traveling north so we meandered along with them; they led us to more whales and less fog, perfect! We started seeing more and more; we were able to identify many from
K-pod including K-27 "Deadhead"
(referring more to a dangerous vertically-bobbing log than a music groupie) and her baby, K44 (yet to be named). Lots of whales in the common hunting formation of trios, pairs and loners. The whales dropped us off at Mosquito Pass, at least that's where the end--the trailers--of the pod was. This allowed us to cut through between Henry Island and San Juan, pass Roche Harbor and ultimately circumnavigate San Juan Island (no more fog on this side!).
