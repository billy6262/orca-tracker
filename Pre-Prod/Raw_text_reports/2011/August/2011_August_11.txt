We headed towards Victoria to try and find the elusive
Humpback Whale
. The last reports we heard were of two animals that had just 'fluked up' and gone for a deeper dive. So we slowly moved into the area, turned off the engines, and waited. After only a few short minutes we had
two mature Humpbacks
surface not far from the boat side by side. We watched as they each took a few breaths, spouting about 15 feet in the air, and then getting great shots of a double fluke as the dove again. We repositioned the boat and waited for the next surfacing. As we scanned all the around, I heard passengers from another boat gasp in excitement and I turned just in time to see both Humpbacks completely breach out of the water!! Our other boat, the Sea Lion, was between us and the whales, but one of the Humpbacks got so much air that I could see it over the top of the other boat. It was Incredible! Humpbacks are some of my favorite whales in the world.
