Orca Sightings for August 10, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Huge groups moving together like ballet. At one point we had probably
30 [orcas]
making simultaneous direction changes. Sunset trip was equally awesome with smaller groups of whales, but much more active!

It was
J's & K's Wed morning at Eagle, L's came in from the west in the morning and met up with J's & K's in the afternoon
.

The first trip we had
all three pods
meandering up and down the
west side of San Juan
. Fortunately for us, when we got out on the west side (after finding a very young
minke whale
), the whales had decided to move offshore. We watched one group of approximately
30 whales
surfacing in close proximity to each other. They would surface heading one direction, and then gracefully turn in one large group and head another direction. It was like water ballet--I've not witnessed such large group direction changes simultaneously before. For our evening trip, the whales were still meandering
off of False Bay
, but in "smaller" groups of about 15 whales.

We found them today, out by
False Bay
, very spread out and difficult to ID - am guessing around
35-40 [orcas]
. We did spot
K21 Capuccino, K27 with K44
streaking alongside mom. Some
J's too - J27 and J47
but the water was somewhat choppy and difficult to get clear photos. They were still heading south when we left them, around

2:30 pm
, and heard the L's were heading into town also.

As we came around the west side of
San Juan Islan
d, we spotted a cacophony of sea birds and right among them,
two minke whales
surfaced!
