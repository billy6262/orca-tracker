Orca Sightings for August 14, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon at

2:45 PM
a big group of
Southern Residents
passed by close to shore at
Land Bank's Westside Preserve
heading north. Included were at least the
J11s, J17s, J22s, and the L12s
. I was also surprised to see
L82 and L116
pop up! They didn't seem to be in much of a hurry and were very playful.

J, K and L Pods
today off the west side of San Juan - a total surprise! No sign of J and K pods until they appeared off the
west side of San Juan Island at 2 p.m
. The first group of whales passing by the lighthouse had
Granny J-2 and Spieden J-8
and several others. Then more came up and as they passed the lighthouse
Fluke L-105 and Racer L-72 surfaced. Nyssa L-84, Ballena L-90, Marina L-47 and baby L-115 and more
.
L Pod had returned!
And they kept coming. Even the L-12s were present along with J and K pods. The only family groups that I did not see at least one member of were the L2s and the L54s. What a surprise it was! They continued to travel up island. I'll post more about the encounter with pictures to my blog Whale of a Purpose.
