Orca Sightings for August 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched the
L's (at least 20-25)
from land, a little bit north at
Hannah Heights
area from

7:00-
7:30 am
. Exuberant socializing, foraging, tail lobs (many in succession of 3-4), spyhops, lunging, rolls, love, breaches. The sound of their blows heard from way up on the bend at Bailer HIll/West Side Road. Was an amazing 1/2 hour. When we left, they were heading south again at about Pile Point.

5:35pm
update: We stayed at Lime Kiln all day, none of the Orca that way. Last reports from Bob Otis at the lighthouse: was L's came through the Juan de Fuca Strait and hooked up with the L12's near
Salmon bank
, (South Beach) earlier and were still there, possibly heading north.
J's & K's last reported off of Lummi Island
late this afternoon, heading south.

The
killer whales
were close today so we had plenty of observation time and were able to see a smorgasbord of species. We first encountered L pod and successfully identify the 34-year-old male Mega (L-41) who was traveling alongside the 22-year-old male Gaia (L-78). What was really exciting was the amount of calves that were traveling and playing together. There were at least three youngsters who were taking turns lob tailing, propoising, spy hopping and breaching next to each other. After spending our fair share of time with the killer whales,
minke whales
were next out by
Salmon Bank
. There were two whales which surfaced more frequently than normal and surprised us by coming up right next to the boat, close enough to hear them breathe.

I heard
echolocation
at
Lime Kiln
for a while this
morning
, and a lot of loud boats came and lingered, screeching into the hydrophone, so I'm assuming the orcas were there even though I didn't hear any vocalizations.
