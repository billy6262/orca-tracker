Orca Sightings for August 23, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
two humpbacks off of Guemes island
while we were out with Deer Harbor Charters. They were swimming in sync, and in fairly shadow water, often swimming close to the island. One had a large notch in his dorsal fin, and our naturalist suspected it may have been a prop injury. Underneath side of the tail was primarily white.

I was out at
Washington Park (Anacortes)
today doing my weekly Harbor Porpoise survey. We survey Burrows Pass, the water between Washington Park and Burrows Island. I not only saw two groups of Harbor Porpoise but just as I was ready to leave I heard a blow that could not have come from a harbor porpoise. When I looked there were
two Humpback Whales
entering the pass. I could clearly see their dorsal fin and as they made their turn around Borrows Island they were kind enough to wave with their Flukes. One appeared to be smaller then the other. Of course I did not have my camera with me. The larger one's fluke was mostly white on the underside and the smaller one had a little white on the underside of each tip of its fluke. Pass is deep but could not believe Humpbacks would come so close to land.
PS: The other thing I noticed, their blowhole and dorsal fin appeared to have a white coating on them. Normal?

Headed out
between Shaw and Lopez Islands
, past Orcas and out towards Lummi Island, we were in search of the ever-popular but very elusive (in the Pacific Northwest)
humpback whale
. We saw boats out by Lummi. And then, we saw a blow! And then another. But wait, there was another set of blows! We had not one but
two humpback whales
! As we continued to view the humpbacks, we noticed that one appeared a little smaller than the other; did we have a mother and almost-yearling calf? The larger whale would breathe for about 4-5 cycles and then fluke-up dive and then the smaller one would follow suite. Perhaps two juveniles, teens hanging out. Before we could get too far, though, we saw lots of small gray bodies porpoising (bringing part of their bodies up) out of the water.
