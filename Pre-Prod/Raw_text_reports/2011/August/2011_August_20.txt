Orca Sightings for August 20, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here in
Clayoquot
we had
4 bulls
heading up the coast with a couple of Xs (females or juvenile males) and we don't know who they were. We've never seen this sex ratio in the past.
Rod Palm, Principal Investigator, Strawberry Isle Marine Research Society
Note: These we identified as members of the R Clan of Northern Residents.

We were with
all 3 pods until 8.20pm
and they were moving slowly west!

Just north of
False Bay
on the west side of San Juan Island, we caught up with some zig-zagging orcas!
L-pod
was cruising around and we were able to identify
L-85
"Mystery" with his shorter but wide dorsal fin and comet-shaped saddle patch of white. At one point, we were surrounded by whales on all sides and we just shut down, dropped our hydrophone into the sea and listened to them. We heard lots of orca sounds, from high-pitched squeaks and squawks to whistles and clicks. We discovered that animals from
J and K-pods
were headed south towards our spot and we eventually saw
K-21
"Cappuccino," a 25-year old mature male.

While sitting at
Lime Kiln
waiting for whales to come down from the north, I was surprised at

1:15 PM
when whales suddenly came up from the south! It was the
L2s and L54s
, presumably going north to meet the other whales. These seven whales just passed the point north of Lime Kiln, then just milled back and forth around until the other whales approached. Around
2:00 PM, whales started coming back south.
K20 and K38
passed close to shore, with
K27 and K44
a little further off. Some whales were out at least a mile or two offshore, but before

3:00 PM
another big group passed about 200 yards offshore. IDs were difficult due to the backlighting, but I saw members of the following matrilines in this group:
J14s, L55s, L47s, and L26s
. If all members of those family groups were there, that's 23 whales, which seems about right for how many were traveling together.

I was fishing off
Sandy Point (Whidbey Island)
at dawn on Saturday morning and heard a large blow. I was able to catch sight of what looked like a lone
humpback
making its way north up
Saratoga Passage closer to Camano Island
. It was dead still and quiet and I was able to hear the whale making its whale sounds (not sure what you call that), but it was very cool. A couple of hours later I saw it again coming back south and this time got a clear look and was able to confirm it was a humpback by the small dorsal.

We had a pod of of
orcas
a whopping 18 miles west out of
Moss Landing, Monterey Bay CA
. Nancy Black confirmed the pod as
CA39s
. There was only CA39 and her offspring-- no adult male in the pod. When we got there there were mini-rafts of sea lions grouped together sticking their flippers out of the water. We would see the pod swim toward the rafts and dive under. A few seconds later, the sea lions panicked and took off porpoising east. We saw them charge at a sea lion but then continued west. Nancy said they had killed a sea lion about a half hour earlier.

Northern BC whale sightings sent in by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC
Northern Resident Orca
At least 8 Orca were around Arrow Passage and slowly heading towards Fife Sound. Some dolphins decide to harass them for a short time. They were very spread out from the Holford Islets and worked their way towards Wells Passage/Polkinghorne Island area. I dropped the hydrophone and immediately recognized some G-Clan calls. I left them around Polkinghorne Island 11 am headed West towards Numas Islands, Queen Charlotte Strait. Some Resident Orca by Naka Creek, other Resident Orca at the Broken Group as far as Forward Bay.
Northern BC transient Orca
Transient Orca by McMillan Point, Cortez Island, headed North by Marina Island into Hoskyn Channel, by Cortez Island. They were the T101's and T102. Some Transients were headed North by Cape Mudge towards Campbell River.
