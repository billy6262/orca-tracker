Orca Sightings for August 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Off the
west side of San Juan
we watched a group of juveniles splashing and playing for about 10 minutes before we realized what the focus of their attention was. It became clear when this youngster appeared with the latest in orca hat fashion? a salmon!

Members of
J, K & L pods
passed by
Lime Kiln from 8-11am
, first heading north and then back south again. J8 put on a bit of a show with several breaches. Many cartwheels and a few tail lobs from some of the others. Members present included J2 & K12.

Two killer whales
came up real close to our boat! Then a few more surfaced all around us and one even breached! They slowly started moving away from us, but Mike stayed close for a little while longer. The group was in no hurry though, taking the time to tail slap and turn over, slapping the water with their pectoral fins. I was able to identify J26 (Mike) as well as L72 (Racer) from this group. We found more killer whales, lots of them! We slowed and watched a group of about four whales tail slapping, rolling around, and spy hopping. Then to the other side of the boat there were juveniles porpoising and breaching. The groups started coming together and there were now maybe twenty whales, one of which was obviously
L41
(Mega).

This morning just after
8 AM
I arrived at
Lime Kiln State Park
and whales were already going by heading north. The first whale I saw was
L2, and L88
was offshore of her. The whales were very spread out and going on long dives which made them hard to track. Between 8 and 9 o'clock I also saw
L22 and L79, K22 and K37, and the L54s
. While these whales continued north, at 9 I could see a large group of whales heading south past Land Bank, as well.
