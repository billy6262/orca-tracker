We saw some whales I haven't seen for over two months...
transients
! There were four of them, traveling very quickly, their dorsal fins waving in front of us. It was the
T-19 group
, and I love seeing the transients because they are really the coolest, top predator of the sea!

Northern Resident Orca:
The A4, A5 and I15 Matrilines of Orca were Eastbound by Eve River, Johnstone Strait, the trailing group of I15's were still headed East by the Broken Islands.
