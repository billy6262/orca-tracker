I bet that some others will report the beautiful scene today watching
J Pod swimming north up Haro Strait
as they passed Turn Pt./Stuart I. light and went as far as South Pender I.'s SW shore then turned to go south. We watched them from
1345 to 1515
hours. There was a
humpback
in the vicinity, as well, that was entangled in some fishing gear. As we left, the orcas were spread out in arc of about 120 degrees around the humpback; distance of various individual orcas to HB = 100 yards to approximately 1/3 mile. Verrrry interesting! Sound Watch was doing their normal great service with the private boaters nearby. Strait Watch was tracking the humpback and Fisheries staff arrived on scene about 1500. We heard they were all going to attempt to cut the gear loose from the whale.

A fisherman reports that at about

8:45pm
, at 44 40 x 125 08 (off
Oregon
), while pulling in tuna lines, a
single juvenile orca
surfaced 8-9' from his boat, and "scared the living daylight out of him."

Here is the
Humpback whale
I saw from
Lime Kiln
as he followed the resident orcas up island. (
This is the humpback called Canuck that is tangled in fishing gear.

We had a group of approximately
10-12 Pacific Whitesided dolphins
feeding and frolicking off
Point Roberts
today. They remained in the area just off the marina entrance
from
4:30 until around 9 pm
when we could hear them slowly moving North. They were very active - leaping, charging, tail slapping, and breaching. Very exciting!

30+ Transient Orcas
were sighted off
Victoria
this afternoon moving mostly East. Ron Bates said that there had been two Orcas i.d. as California Transient:)
Andrew Lees
Dave Ellifrit sent me some great ID pics from the big transient sighting on 25 August. The
three CA T's are the large male CA20 (T132), and females CA54 (T134) and CA177
. CA20 and CA54 visited Glacier Bay in 1989. CA54 was likely the third whale in Doug Miller's sighting on 26 August.

After two whole days without
orcas
around (but with
Humpbacks and Minkes
!) our
residents returned to the sound
in full force. There were groups representing all 3 pods up in the area
between Stuart and Pender Islands
. When we came on scene the whales we were with appeared to be resting. After about 20 minutes they suddenly turned around and sped up. There were whales everywhere. We were surrounded! As we prepared to leave the area a
Humpback
appeared, heading north. We had heard about the animal earlier in the day. We kept our distance and didn't stop to watch the single whale, as it was entangled in fishing gear and there were boats around with the hopes of untangling it from the line.
