Orca Sightings for August 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Early reports of
"lots" of whales
in
San Juan Channel
. Turns out it was
J Pod, K Pod, AND L Pod
. The whales cruised by
Friday Harbor and headed towards Cattle Point
, where they decided to split apart. L Pod continued out to the west side of San Juan while Js and Ks (and apparently the L2s) turned and headed back north. We caught up with the whales during our afternoon trip in one of my favorite areas in
Boundary Pass--Monarch Head
. The whales had been breaching for quite awhile before we arrived, so they were in a bit of resting mode. That is until a huge container ship threw a huge wake across the front of about 20 orcas and they decided to play in the wake and began breaching over and over. Tons of tail lobs, cartwheels, a few spyhops. All with Mt. Baker in the background. More Js and Ks were swimming along the shoreline and doing a lot of foraging. We watched J27 Blackberry do multiple tail lobs as he chased after a female (who was swimming upside down so I couldn't get an ID). We also spotted K21 Cappucino and also little K44 (so peachy colored you couldn't miss the little guy!) It was nice seeing all the boats giving the whales space (except for one private sailboat who Soundwatch had to intercept as they passed between our boat and a nice group of whales). All the surface activity of the last few weeks had us pondering if the whales are so active because they are getting enough salmon to eat? As we prepared to leave, one female gave us a beautiful parting gift of a perfectly lit breach.

The
Js and Ks
turned and headed north from
Friday Harbor
sometime around
10am
and kept truckin' north until 5. Thats where I last saw them, just around the corner from
East Point
in the Straight of Georgia, going north.

It was bright and sunny as we headed north out of
Friday Harbor
. We spotted a few killer whale dorsal fins off in the distance. As the boat turned there was a
large pod of orcas
, over twenty whales close to each other surfacing and breathing. Then, all of a sudden one breached, then another next to the first one, then a third after the second one, then two whales breached at the same time! It looked like it was coordinated. The whales continued to be super active and playful throughout the time we watched them; spy hopping, tail slapping, lob tailing, and occasionally more breaching!

J+K+L pod
members came by
Friday Harbor
today, you could see them from the
9 a.m.
ferry this morning. After that L pod broke off from the group and was seen on the South side of San Juan Island this afternoon and I'm not sure what the J's and K's were up to by then. :)

At least
eight Orcas
passed through the
San Juan Channel
, near Pt. Caution and the University of Washington property, at

8:45am
this morning ... moving east toward Friday Harbor at a fast speed, just forty or fifty yards off of the north shore of San Juan Island.

Northern Resident Orca
Northern Resident Orca were spread out in Johnstone Strait from the Robson Bight Ecological Reserve along the Hanson Island shoreline.Vessel Kermode. Orca were closer to the Pearse Islands, across from Beaver Cove, by Chatham Point Lightstation, where Johnstone Strait starts, just above Campbell River, and more headed into Nodales Channel.
The A30 Matriline made their way up along Johnstone Strait and were actively foraging in Beaver Cove. Northern Residents including some of the I15's and I 16's were Westbound slowly by Lizard Point, Malcolm Island.
A12 and the two A36 brothers were headed West up Johnstone Strait by Eve River. Around 20 Northern Resident Orca including the A11's and others were Westing quickly just above Campbell River by Ripple Point.
A12 and the 'boys' have made it up to the Robson Bight Ecological Reserve.
