Orca Sightings for August 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
From: Nick Templeman (To Rod Palm, SIMRS):
These two males were travelling thru past Campbell river today with 7 other animals. I don't think I have seen either of these 2 before and cannot really find them in the books. Any ideas my friend??
Cheers, Nick!
Orca Network sent the above photos on to Alisa Schulman-Janiger, who replied:
Yes, these ARE
California transients
!
Male 1 is N25, and Male 2 is CA24
. They are nearly always seen together. Some recent sightings of these boys were in April and May in Monterey, CA. Images posted by Nick Templeman on the Eagle Eye Adventure Facebook page show that
CA180 was also with CA24 and N25 on

Entry 2:
Another
NE Florida orca
report from
August 9: My family stayed
at the beach in St Augustine FL
. We were out a little further than normal so the kids could use floats. I saw a huge amount of fish jumping out of the water so i started looking to see what was making them move. When my daughter started screaming shark. I looked to the left where she was trying to get out of the water. I knew it wasn't a shark because of its fin it look like an orca (juvenile), but
I was looking at it and it was looking at me
. I was shocked because my mind was saying you don't belong here. Have you had any sightings in St Augustine Fl? (
Yes, on
August 1 from New Smyrna FL and on
August 6 in St. Augustine FL
). We did hear of other people saying they saw whales. My daughter was right next too it and I was close enough to look into its face. I'll never forget the eyes.

Boats from Victoria reported the [
orcas
] were returning and had reached the
Jordan River coming east to San Juan Island
. For our
1:30 tour the large group of whales had not come far east enough for us to reach. When departing for the

5:30
trip, Captain Craig had learned that the whales had progressed
5 miles east of Race Rocks
, which is apprx in front of Victoria break water. While reaching Vancouver Island it was learned that the orca whales had stalled out. But after coming this far, it was decided to continue on. The whales were socializing in a tight group. We could see about 30 of them at a time from the boat.

J's, K's, and L's
returned to the interior waters in the
morning
. We first picked them up off of
Jordan River at
10:30
. They socialized and sauntered in towards Sooke no quicker than the incoming flood current and passed up the fishing hot spots to the delight of the local salmon fishing guides.
