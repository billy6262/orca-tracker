Orca Sightings for November 19, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:45 pm
- Dick and I just saw a
pod of Orcas
(no idea what grouping) pass by heading south. They were just south of the
Bush Pt. lighthouse
when we first spotted them traveling fairly close to the Whidbey shoreline. There was at least one very large male and a number of females and/or juveniles.

We had a fairly good sized
pod of Orca
headed south about a mile off shore from
Lagoon Point
. I got a few shots but the Orca were far out and they were partially past our house by the time I saw them. They seemed to be foraging, hope they found a good lunch.

2:30 pm
- We saw what we assume to be and
Orca Pod
, but don't know enough to identify it.
6-8 individuals
, including a couple males. We spotted them from
Lagoon Point
, Whidbey Island; they were traveling toward Bush Point (southbound through Admiralty Inlet) and were just south of Lagoon Point traveling on the east side of Admiralty Inlet.
