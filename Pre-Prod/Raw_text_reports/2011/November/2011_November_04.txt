Orca Sightings for November 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
A
mother and calf humpback pair
were encountered in the morning by Ivan Reiff, of the Western Prince, traveling south
in San Juan Channel
. The calf was very playful and was making a lot of noise. On Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon the same pair were crossing
toward Hein Bank
. The calf continued to be very playful, a spyhop, pec waving, rolling around and breaching. There were four branded Steller sea lions between
November 3 and 4 that were at Whales Rocks. More about the encounter including more pictures of that spunky calf breaching, along with pictures of the branded Stellers are posted on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.
