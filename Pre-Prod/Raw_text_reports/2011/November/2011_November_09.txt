Orca Sightings for November 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just spotted a
minke whale
out in the middle of
Saratoga Passage
, headed west/northwest. Pretty certain that is the id, even though it was far out in the channel. Our first minke! Please let me know if there is another sighting...the timing was about

2:45 pm
