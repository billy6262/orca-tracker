Orca Sightings for November 13, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw
two orcas
heading west at about

10:30 a.m
. this morning. I was on
Ediz Hook (Port Angeles)
very near the coast guard base, looking north watching a pilot boat delivering a pilot to a big ship, and I suddenly saw a fin which appeared very large and nearby in my binoculars. What a thrill!! I saw two of them surfacing and diving as they swam by and I saw them come up about 4 times before they disappeared. One had a bigger greyish fin, and the other had an oval white patch on its side. I didn't get to see their tails or much of their bodies, just their backs and the left side of one of them.
