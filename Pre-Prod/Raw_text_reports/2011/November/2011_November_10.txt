At about

10:30 a.m. echolocation clicks on the Lime Kiln hydrophones
. From Lime Kiln,
Raggedy K-40 and Cappuccino K-21 were seen
traveling down island. There were a few vocalizations on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. From Hannah Heights at
11:20 K-21, K-40 and Opus K-16 and Sonata K-35 were seen. On Maya's Westside Charters at about

1:45
along with the Western Explorer we encountered these same whales again heading west, south of Discovery Island. No other SRKWs were spotted. We left them at
3:00 heading west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. More on the encounter with pictures posted on my blog Whale of a Purpose.

A surprising whale report for you today. At approximately

9:30am, we watched 7-9 orcas pass by the west side of SJI at Hannah Heights
headed south. I believe they could have been residents but was not able to get a positive ID on any of them. Still, nice to see orcas in November!
Sandy Buckley

At fort Casey. Saw
multiple blows
from two individuals. Too far offshore to get an Id. Time is

2:42
. (probably humpbacks.)
Cathy Bacon

Flying kenmore air from lake union to Lopez, spotted
3 humpbacks about
8:20am
. Appox. location just a little north of the line between Keystone and Port Townsend. 2 were close to each other and one was a little north. From their blow, looked like they were heading east.
