I wanted to report

Entry 2:
, at approx.
1pm
, there was
5-6 Orcas
, with at least one male. It looked like they were feeding, all circling a lot in the same area, but nothing was visible on the surface. When we left the area, they appeared to be heading on a southerly course. This is the first time I have seen Orcas in the San Diego, CA area. We did take some pictures, mostly of the male, since he was the only one really moving around away from the group, if you would like to have them. Dont know if this has anything to do with the dead fin whale that was found beached off of Pt. Loma CA today?
