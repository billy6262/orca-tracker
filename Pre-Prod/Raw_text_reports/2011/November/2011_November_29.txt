Kingston

between Bainbridge and Blake Islands
, closer to Bainbridge, and some north of the south tip of Bainbridge.

12:13 pm -
Trileigh Tucker called again to say the orcas she's watching are headed north now, almost up to
Eagle Harbor
, which is where they were at
10:30 this morning. She says she is only seeing 3 or 4.

KOMO news took some footage of the
orcas

Seattle
from a chopper.

1:15 pm -
Saw a small group of
orcas
northbound mid-channel in shipping lanes; they joined with some another southbound group and are now all southbound about halfway down
Blake Island
. So nice to have them in the neighborhood again!

I've got a telescope in Alki, just spotted them, hanging around just off the point of

Chris Kennedy of WA State Ferries called at

10:38
to relay a report of
orcas
in the shipping lane, east of
Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island
, heading south.
*
Between

08:20 and
08:40
today I saw at least
12 Orcas traveling south past Meadow Pt. in Golden Gardens Park
, Seattle. I was able to watch them from the Kingston/Edmonds area as they headed south. 2 or 3 went into
Port Madison Bay
and then came back out and continued to head south along the E side of
Bainbridge
. Others came closer to the buoy off Meadow Point, including a baby. There were some larger males, but they stayed closer to the Bainbridge side of the sound. I did not notice any unusual markings or scars. Most were just headed south. One spy-hopped. There may have been some feeding, as they disrupted a large group of gulls who were actively feeding.
