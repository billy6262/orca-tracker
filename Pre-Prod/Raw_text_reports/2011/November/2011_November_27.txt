Orca Sightings for November 27, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
While driving home from Whistler on the Sea to Sky highway at around noon, we spotted
4-5 orcas swimming not far offshore (north of Vancouver BC)
. We were past Brittania Beach but well before Horseshoe Bay. This sighting was especially exciting, since we've watched for Orca from this road for over 20 years and this is the first time we've ever seen them there!

7:20 a.m
. - faint sounds
on Lime Kiln Hydrophones
. At

7:32a.m
. I checked OS Hydrophones and heard
clearer Resident call
s. At
8am
I saw a group of whales, about eight, apx 1/2 mile from shore going up island, taking long dives. In that group was a big male with a wide, leaning to the left, dorsal fin. There were also two females with young offspring, at least one sprouter, and possibly two others. After several minutes I spotted whales at about 1 mile from shore heading down island. Assuming they were all Residents and had changed direction I went to Lime Kiln Pt. State Park where I saw members of th
e J14s and Onyx L-87 heading down island
at at about 1/2 mile from shore. Other whales could be seen far offshore also heading down and their calls indicated J and K pod whales. Looking at my images it was revealed that
the group of whales heading north were Transients
and not Residents!! I'll post pictures and the story to show the Transients on my blog Whale of A Purpose.

Same
4 transients
today in roughly the same area (
Moss Landing CA
). In fact, they killed another sea lion in almost the exact same spot! Didn't play with their food too much, seemed like a quick bite to eat.
