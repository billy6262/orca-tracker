Orca Sightings for November 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
At least
two orcas came past the south end of Lopez
on Thanksgiving morning around 10am heading from east to west. With the whitecaps, swells and strong winds the orcas were hard to spot, so perhaps there were more we didn't see.
