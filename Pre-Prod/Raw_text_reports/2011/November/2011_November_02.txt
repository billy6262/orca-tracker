Orca Sightings for November 2, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted
J's, K's and L's
south of
Race Rocks
in the
morning
very spread out foraging. They were heading west, but in the afternoon they turned around offshore of East Sooke and were socializing as they headed back east.

Jeff Lamarche of Eagle Wing Tours called at

3:45pm
to say they're all coming in,
heading east now, 2.5 miles SW of Race Rocks
at a steady pace for the past hour, with great vocalizations. Mark Malleson is also out with them, and together they've seen
all the matrilines except the L12's and the L22s,
but they could also be out there and just haven't been seen yet. Jeff first called at
2:20pm to say he was with all three pods, possibly all 88 So. Resident orcas, in the St. of Juan de Fuca, five miles west of Race Rocks and two miles south of Beechy Head. They were headed west, but with some milling, so they, or some of them, could still turn around any time (and they did).

5:00 pm - They are SE of race Rocks heading East
