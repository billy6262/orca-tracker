Orca Sightings for February 8, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Candace Calloway Whiting for forwarding this report on to us: I happened on a facebook comment from the
Fort Bragg
area about a pod of orcas, so I wrote the person to see if they had photos, no luck though, but I thought I would pass it on anyway. Here is what she said: "We watched an entire pod of
Orca
whales! It was about
noon
. My husband & I saw them. first they were moving south and then they seemed to be going in a circle and staying in the same place. We watched them for about 10-15 min. We couldn't tell exactly what kind of Orca - it was very choppy seas.

The person who sent this [below] is Mike Petherick. He is a volunteer at
Point Cabrillo CA
Light Station State Historic Park. Mike lived in Puget Sound at one time and is familiar with orcas so you can trust this report.

From Mike Petherick: At the Light it was quiet but at about
1 PM
I looked out the window to see a pod of about
20 Orcas
(black fish to me) just off-shore moving slowly south. High swells and they were almost surfing. Difficult to get an accurate count but a very large group.At least two bulls, probably more, cows, juveniles and I thought I saw a couple of calves. I'm guessing they may have been hunting as they were close in. To make it even better they all appeared to be in good health with completely upright dorsals. I didn't have a telephoto on my camera, which I usually do and will from now on, so can't try to ID the group.
