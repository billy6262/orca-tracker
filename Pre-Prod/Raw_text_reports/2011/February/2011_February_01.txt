Orca Sightings for February 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to the sightings reported this morning in Puget Sound, I scanned for detections and found that WhoListener triggered on many calls from

21:40-
23:29
. After hearing that
SRKWs
had been sighted this morning in Puget Sound near Vashon Island, I checked through the Port Townsend automated detections. Although no live listeners caught the many calls between about 9pm and midnight, they were relatively loud compared to past detections, suggesting that some of the pod members were passing through
Admiralty Inlet
on the Port Townsend side.
This was a good example of how the southern residents can sneak up on the proposed Snohomish County tidal power site. Jeanne heard J and K pod calls as late as
19:16 and
19:27 on 1/30/11 at Orcasound and Lime Kiln, respectively. The latest Orca Network report mentioned others hearing them slightly later and Sandy Buckley getting hints they were headed north, though Jeanne had heard they were heading south in Active Pass earlier that day (at
14:45). So, where were they yesterday - up north or out west? I heard S1, 2, 4, and a handful of S16s, so suspect we'll get photo ID confirmation today that the visiting pods are Js and maybe a few Ks. I didn't notice any whistles or clicks.

Orca Network received a call this morning from Debbie Williams reporting at least
7-8 orcas

Iceberg Pt
., Lopez Isl. on Feb. 1 at
3 PM.

Sightings report given to me by The Park Rangers at Lime Kiln Pt. State Park. They were on their boat, having left Roche Harbor, gone to Stuart Island and were heading for Jones Island. As they passed through Spieden Island and the Cactus Islands they saw
two orca
heading west toward
Spieden Channel
. Then they saw several other whales to the south between San Juan Island and Yellow Island, they were closer to the SJI side. It was

10:00 a.m
. They went on to Jones Island, and at
10:45a.m. they left and headed towards Turn Island (just south of Friday Harbor). They were able to determine these were
residents
by their fin shapes and there were more than 15. At least two males, several females and they did see at least one little one. They left Turn Island headed for Upright Channel. They could see the whales still to the north in San Juan Channel, looking as if they were foraging. (Just a guess but now we may know where they had been between confirmed hearing of them on Sunday night and confirmed hearing of them on Tuesday night-with an ever so brief hearing of them at mid day on Monday.)
