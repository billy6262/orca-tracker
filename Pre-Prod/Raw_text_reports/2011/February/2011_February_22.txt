point traveling south they looked to be juveniles and seemed to be just messing around, about 1310 5 more were sighted heading in the same direction, one large orca possibly male large dorsal fin, with 3 smaller whales one of which must have been a female due to the fact that a much smaller whale, young calf? was swimming right beside her I saw the young one breach twice and it was much smaller than any of the others. All seven whales were headed south towards ollalla through colvos.
