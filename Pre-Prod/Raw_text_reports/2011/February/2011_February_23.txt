Orca Sightings for February 23, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
A pod of
orcas
traveling north at Scatchet Head Bouy (
SW Whidbey Island
) at
~
12:45
. I noticed a big splash from my house, about two miles away, then saw at most four fins at a time moving quickly north. I guessed at a much larger pod spread out over a half mile. Occasionally there was another big splash, but I couldn't see if it was feeding activity. I saw them heading up the west side of Scatchet Head between the shipping lanes and the buoy, basically heading towards Maxwelton. Like you said, maybe there's more than one pod. I wonder if I saw the passing of two groups: one feeding and one moving. Can't say for sure.

At least eight
Orcas
were observed from the
8AM Bainbridge
Ferry about 1/2 mile NW of Blakes Island. They were moving slowly N in two groups. I suspect they were hunting salmon since they were spread out and there was a lot of tap slapping and exuberant activity, including one spectacular breech not far from the ferry. Wonderful way to start the day.

Saw 4
orcas
while riding the
Bainbridge Island
to Seattle ferry this morning. They appeared to be playing, eating, sky hopping. They were on the south side of boat.
