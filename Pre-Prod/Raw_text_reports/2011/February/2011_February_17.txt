Orca Sightings for February 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went out today on our boat, High Spirits, for sea trials with the Coast Guard (in horrible weather!) and saw a pod of
3 [orcas
] about 1/2 mile outside the jetty. I saw them surface twice, porpoising out of the water and then they disappeared in the swells. There was a lone sea-lion swimming by. One large male in the group. Unfortunately I didn't have my camera as I didn't think I'd need it for man overboard drills! Now I know better.

Thought you might be interested in
orca
sightings this morning. We're out on
Dungeness Spit
, 'keeping' the New Dungeness Light Station for the week. This morning we made the following observations of orcas just off the end of the Spit (48-11-10N, 123-06-03W) at

08:15
PST: 3; one large male, smaller (female?) immediately adjacent; another (juvenile?) with saber thin dorsal traveling somewhat separately. Appeared to be cruising and perhaps feeding but not evident on what; moving very slowly in tide rips off end of spit; observed four tail slaps in relatively rapid succession for one individual. one large male with very folded top 20% of dorsal; doesn't seem to match any of the photos of resident pod males, but maybe just a floppy dorsal day?
