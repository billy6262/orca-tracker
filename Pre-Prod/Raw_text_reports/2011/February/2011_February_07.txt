Orca Sightings for February 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
4 PM
- Alisa Brooks just called from
Everett
after seeing some [
orca
] fins across
Saratoga Passage
, heading south toward Clinton, closer to the Whidbey side.

4:30:
From mukilteo spotted a few heading east fast towards everett, going by hat island. We never saw them come south of Clinton so perhaps they turned back north towards you. Was nice to see a few breaches out there off Whidbey at
4:00. My friend Cindy is the one with the good eyes, she spotted them both times.

It's very windy and hard to see much, but at least 2 females and one male
orca
were in the area between the western point of Elger Bay (
Camano Island
) and Fox Point (
Whidbey Island
) about halfway out at

12:30 pm
. They moved over closer to Elger Bay and then headed south as far as I could tell.

After just a glimpse of a fin at
noon
, (off Hidden Beach/N. Bluff, Saratoga Passage/
Greenbank
) they disappeared heading south. Looked for another 1.5 hours but never could find them again amongst the white-caps.
