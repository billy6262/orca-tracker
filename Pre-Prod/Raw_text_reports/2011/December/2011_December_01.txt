Orca Sightings for December 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw
4 Orcas
- 2 and 2 together, just north of
Picnic Point, near Edmonds, WA
. They were traveling north about

9:30 A.
Looked like they were playing or just traveling through. There were no very large fins. Assumed females and babies. No markings - Too far out.

I understand that
both J and K pods were in Saratoga Passage
yesterday, Dec. 1 about 4 PM? Whoever they were, it was QUITE a show. I was part of the lucky group down on the beach at Camano Island State Park. A number of the orcas were feeding close to the beach, along a tide line. Obviously good fishing! While watching those close to shore, we would also sight a number of orcas over toward Baby Island, and across Saratoga Passage toward Greenbank, including a few tall fins.

We saw the
orcas from
1:45 to
3:30
, and more were coming after that, mostly across Saratoga Passage, but with the leaders 8 to ten miles ahead of the last ones. There was very little play or splashing, but several direction changes.

Jill Hein of Coupeville called to report she watched the
orcas pass between Camano Island & Harrington Lagoon
, Whidbey Isl. until

4:30 pm
, still heading NW
*
At Cama Beach State Park, we watched
10-15 orcas heading North up Saratoga Passage
. Sightings occurred over at least a two hour period. They were very spread out in small unidentified groups of three to five with at least two males. The males were seen perhaps an hour apart. Orcas also seen here in the past. I saw several traveling North in August of this year as well.

whales are a few hundred feet from the Mukilteo ferry landing
