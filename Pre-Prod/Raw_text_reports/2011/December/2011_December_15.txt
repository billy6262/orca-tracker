Orca Sightings for December 15, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We live on the west side of Mill Bay
(Saanich Inlet, north of Victoria BC)
, and although not frequent, we have sighted Orcas in the Bay. There was a pod back in August, and we have also seen them in May. Thursday 15 December we spotted what
at first seemed to be a lone male
. He was swimming slowly in a circle, and not quartering the area as they seem to do when searching for food. After a while we, got glimpses of
a smaller (female?) inside the male's circle
. They were closer to the Saanich side of the Bay, so even with good binoculars, it was not easy to see detail. But then, as they were leaving the area, a third smaller orca showed itself.

Victoria at

a pod of orcas coming into Victoria Harbor
- no other details as to number of whales, etc.
