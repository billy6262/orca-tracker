Out with Capt. Spencer, Legacy Charters. We encountered
several transients at
1:55 pm
, heading west. When first spotted they were approximately a mile south and
a mile east of Race Rocks
. There were
at least 4, possibly 5
, animals, no adult males in the group. At the same time, behind this group by a couple miles and a bit farther to the south, heading west, were what appeared to be,
4 more
, including one large male. We stayed with the first group for a while, leaving them moving rapidly west. We did not find the second group (hence no proof of who it actually was). Then, on the way back, at four and a half miles south of Victoria, we saw
more transient whales
. There were
5 or 6 and no adult males
. We stayed just long enough to get some photos and left them heading east at
3:15 pm. I will post more of the story with pictures on my blog Whale of A Purpose.
