Orca Sightings for December 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Went back out for one last try at seeing the whales. At

4:10 pm
I saw some just south of
Lagoon Pt
, others further south, nearly to Bush Pt. So I headed down to Bush Pt, and at about

4:30
saw a pod over closer to the Marrowstone Island side, a breach/splash, then a freighter went past & blocked the view for awhile. Then, just as I was about to pack it in, here comes a pod passing much
closer to the Bush Pt. side
- yay!! They were moving fast, & I tried to get photos but since it was so dark & I didn't have time to set up the tripod they are blurry, but it was nice to have a close pass by just before dark! There were more spouts down toward Pt. No Point, so they seem to be
continuing south
- let us know if you hear any blows out there tonight! Who knows where they will show up tomorrow~

Just got home to Everett from Whidbey...THANKS for the
Bush Point
suggestion Orca Network-- I finally got to see them! Sounds like I should have hung around a bit longer to see them closer, but it was still very cool. There was
one big male
with a really tall dorsal. And several
smaller groups of 3 or 4
. They were pretty spread out, but lots of action.

4:10 pm -
Susan just called from
Lagoon Pt
. to say there are still more
orcas in mid-channel heading south
, including at least one male.

Cold, hungry, thirsty but VERY happy (it doesn't take much) after spending four hours observing some of our endangered southern residents in
Admiralty Inlet
. My last sighting was at
4.00 pm
at
Bush Point
when I watched one male, a Mum and calf and a couple of other females/juveniles pass by before they disappeared into the fading light - and who knows where? Note that Susan, a little further up at Lagoon Point, was still seeing whales approaching.

a pod of orcas
moving slowly south in the
Keystone to Port Townsend ferry lane
. He also reported that a group of 5 or 6 juveniles were off to themselves, accompanied by an adult male. Babysitting maybe?
