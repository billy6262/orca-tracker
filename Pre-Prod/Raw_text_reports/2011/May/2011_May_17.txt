Orca Sightings for May 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Steve McGee called Orca Network to report seeing
20+ orcas 7 miles south of Klamath River, northern California
, in 21 fathoms deep water, 5 miles offshore, heading north. Hmm - possibly some of L or K pods heading north?!
*
5 pm:
The
Orca
had spread out a bit withing a triangle from Savary Island, Hernando and Mittlenatch Islands. 4 pm the Whales had made it about two miles South of Sentry Shoal where they let a lone Dalls porpoise get out of their way. They had been zig zagging towards
Powell River
then towards Miracle Beach on Vancouver Island. The Orca then grouped up with lots of vocalization. Ahh, calm weather, sunshine, whales and listening to them talking too! They slowly started to work their way back towards Mittlenatch.

the
Orca
were spread out in smaller groups from the South end of
Quadra Island
to Vancouver Island slowly working their way South. By

2:45 pm
they had made their way to Mittlenatch Island. The count was back up to the 30 + whales.

We got to go out on Maya's charters with Spencer and Jeanne Hyde, and found
J pod
up north by the
coal docks
spread out over a wide area at around

2:40 pm
. They had been going north, then turned west, then east, then south. We saw several breaches (Jeanne said one of the breaching whales was Granny!), tail lobs, and spread out traveling and foraging behaviors.

It's been a long drought for whale sightings for us which finally ended today. From our deck in
Tsawwassen
around

12:45
we saw a small pod of
orcas
slowly heading north. They were very spread out.

We ended up slightly north of the
Coal Docks
and found ourselves amid
Orcas
. There were two whales cruising west, then three, then a whole bunch more. They were spread out to the east and west of us and we realized they weren't transients. One male with a huge dorsal cruised by and I suspect it was Mike of
J pod
. At one point there was a large direction change and suddenly the whales were headed east. The best part about the encounter was three moms with calves, cruising close together. The females would surface and then the little guys would pop up for a quick, mini breath.
