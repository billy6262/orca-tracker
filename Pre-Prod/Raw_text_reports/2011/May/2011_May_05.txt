Orca Sightings for May 5, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Radio call came in from a commercial boat at
9 am
about
10 or more Killer Whales
by Copper Bluffs near
Campbell River BC
. The whales were moving quite quickly heading for Seymour Narrows in a north-west direction.
*
One of the Campbell River Whale Watching boats was out and managed to find the 12 Orca by Chatham Point, just at the lower start of
Johnstone Strait
around
12 pm
, where they stayed and foraged for about an hour. These orcas were later confirmed as
Transients
from Aaron ofCampbell River Whale Watching. Aaron was with these
12 Transients
which he believed included T21 and T22 for around 2 1/2 hours as they played with a seal.
*
Thanks to Elizabeth, who gave me a call around

2:30 pm
about a
pod of Orca
by Beach Gardens, just below Grief Point, Powell River heading North. I quickly managed to get out in the skiff with my daughter and found the
Transient
(meat eating) Orca close by the mill. This is a favorite spot for Transients to find Sea Lions and Seals. There were between 9 and 12 Whales split into two groups. A group of four headed towards Harwood Island while the rest had a late lunch closer to the mill. They stayed in the area till around

5:00 pm
and we left them by Atrevida Reef, heading towards Savary Island and Lund.

at San de Fuca (Penn Cove,
