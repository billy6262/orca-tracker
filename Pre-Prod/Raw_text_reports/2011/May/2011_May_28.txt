Orca Sightings for May 28, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
A group of
5 transient orca
were located at approximately
noon
on the east side of
Galiano Island
, heading northwest. The group was later ID'ed as the
T124A group and T124C
. There appeared to be a calf that was approximately 1- 2 years of age. They were in a steady travel mode during our encounter, with some social interaction observed between the two youngest as they travelled.

1:30 pm
: 12 Orca including 2 very new looking calves were slowly working their way South by Elk Bay just around Seymour Narrows. Although they were quiet, with open saddle patches they were identified as Southern Resident Orca possibly from
L Pod
- but who? They stayed nicely grouped, with a lovely spy hop or two as they very slowly got down by Painters Lodge around 5 pm.

We wanted to let you know we had
L-pod
pass through here late last night! They went South in
Blackney Pass BC
around
0130
and vocalized as they headed into Johnstone Strait. They vocalized for a few hours in Robson Bight before they headed east in
Johnstone Strait
around
0345
. Their vocals were very interesting to listen to! We sent a few clips to John Ford and he confirmed that it was L-pod. So they might be heading down your way!! (you can listen in to OrcaLab's hydrophones at Orca Live). Then at

5:13 pm:
They were amazing to listen to this morning...what a wonderful way to wake-up!!! Sounds like they might be going past
Campbell River
right about now. Have a wonderful day!

Aboard the Mystic Sea we viewed
5 Transients
just Northwest of
Patos Island
in International waters, killing several Stellers. In a heavy tide rip they cartwheeled, tail-slapped and lunged over and over, to down two large Stellers. The action lasted over an hour and they were after yet another when we had to return to Anacortes. Powerfully exciting.

Awesome day along the
Galiano
shoreline today!
5 Transients
rolling and playing for the whole hour we were there. I wasn't able to ID them yet, I don't think I have seen that group before so if anyone knows who they are, let me know. The large female in the first picture has an interesting saddle patch for a T, seems to have a faint black stripe in it.

Jeanne Hyde ID'd the Transient in Gary Sutton's photo, taken along the Galiano shoreline, as T124A

After an hour of solid travel, we edged up to
East point off Saturna Island BC
. And there they were: a pod of
transient orcas
! As we approached the area, we heard through the vessel radio grapevine that the pod may have made a recent Steller sea lion kill. When we got to the scene, the whales were zig-zagging and milling about; no obvious foraging activity was seen. While observing the pod, we noticed a very large adult male dorsal fin that had significant lean to the left and was very curved for a male. The other individuals in the pod appeared to be females and juveniles. Later, another vessel identified one of the orcas as
T18
. After ten minutes or so, the pod started traveling faster towards the south, moving more erratically and then thrashing about. The hunt was on! And it looked like another Steller sea lion was the target. We saw the pod of four orcas thrashing about, throwing their bloody red tasty morsel in the air. At one point, it looked like the sea lion had gotten away and it made some headway with about forty feet of distance from the whales. But then the transients caught up to their meal and continued thrashing and tossing it around. Eventually, the male and a second orca split off from the other two, leaving the latter to contend with the sea lion.
