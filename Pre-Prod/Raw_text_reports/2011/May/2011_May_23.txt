Orca Sightings for May 23, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were out with the
transients
heading west just south of
Victoria
. At one point we clocked them swimming at almost 9kts. I didn't have transient ID photos with me but heard one of the other boats say it was the
T10s
.

10 am
: The
8 to 10 Transient Orca
were slowly working their way between
Powell River and Texada Island BC
- still on a slow roll Southward. So, headed out with neighbour Steve G. to locate them. They did a number of long dives and continued their slow travel Southward in a zig zag pattern. We stayed with them until we were almost across from Smuggler Cove, just above Secret Cove - a long way down from Powell River, and even longer for Jen from Campbell River Whale Watching who arrived on scene with a tour around
2:30 pm. Jen left them around

3:45 pm
spread out and still working their way towards the Southern end of Texada.

Around

10:00am
, a single
gray whale
was heading north, leisurely feeding just off
Tulalip Shores
. Then about

5:00 pm
the whale seemed to return, heading south, again leisurely feeding along the shore. Picnic at Spee-be-dah?
