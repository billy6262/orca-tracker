Orca Sightings for May 15, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Debbie Sharpe, Kira Kranzler, Mercedes Powell of the Center for Whale Research observed
J pod
passing the Center (NW San Juan Island) around

2:00 p.m.
heading north. At
4:25 p.m. we encountered J pod approximately a half mile east of the eastern tip of
Mandarte Island
(48째 38.17 N; 123째 16.10 W). The whales were very spread out, traveling in small groups of threes and fours. The first whales we encountered were a small group containing
J2, J8, L87, J19 and J41
heading north west toward Salt Spring Island, B.C. As we moved north west with the whales we encountered other members traveling slowly, foraging and socializing. There were several moments in which we were given fantastic displays, including spyhops, breaches, tail-lobs, and inverted swimming. We left the whales at
6:47 p.m. about a half mile north of Coal Island (48째 41.35 N; 123째 21.13 W), and returned to Snug Harbor at
7:20 p.m.

Cory Johnson called at

2:20
to say he just saw
2 orcas
, a female and a calf, on
Swiftsure Bank
. He said the female's dorsal fin had a bend in it near the top. He said they were headed north in the freighter lane. He also said his partner saw
8 orcas
on
Swiftsure Bank
this morning, milling.

I was driving the Pile Buck northbound up the coast and happened upon a group of possible
4-6 Transient Orcas
. I was bucking the flood tide in Current Passage making 7kts when a fair sized Orca fin sliced through the water off my starboard bow!, several more to follow. It was an amazing experience as they zipped by with the flood. I believe there was 3 or 4 females; a young calf or year old orca. Also I think there was a young male in the mix that, amongst handling the boat and my camera i didnt get a good look at for sure. Current Passage is in
Johnstone strait
, near Kelsey Bay. Current passage (northbound traffic) sits on the north side of Helmcken island, and on the south side of helmcken island is Race Passage (southbound traffic). On the north side of Current Passage is Hardwicke island. I encountered the T`s at
1112
and I was with them for only minutes.n

When we got closer to
Lime Kiln
we saw blows way in by the rocks. Then we saw a few more farther north. Then a couple surfaced about half way between us and shore. We soon realized that just about all of
J Pod
was spread out over a distance of close to 5 miles. It was hard to focus on just one group of whales. I think at that point every passenger was watching a different whale. We picked Blackberry and Mike out of the lineup as well as Looker, the 2010 calf. There wasn't a lot of surface behavior. The whales in close to shore were cruising north at a steady pace and the few different groups farther out looked like they were just slowly milling. We shut down the engine and sat for a long time, observing the whales about their business. None of them were particularly close to us, but Capt Mike dropped the hydrophone and I couldn't believe what I heard. They were, hands down, the best vocalizations I have heard this season. There was even a point when we could hear the whales at the surface, without the hydrophone. A couple of other boats in the area said the same thing. We sat still and silent while we watched and listened in the rain. There wasn't a single noise aside from the whales. It was the type of day that makes you appreciate just how incredible these animals are and how lucky we are to share these islands with them.
