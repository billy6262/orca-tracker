Orca Sightings for May 25, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
During our May survey of OR/WA waters for juvenile salmon, I observed a pod of
6-10 killer whales
near our trawling station 19 miles off the
Queets River, WA
(QR19). The location was N 47.532, W -124.806. There were definitely two adult males with very tall dorsals, a few large females/subadults and some smaller animals.

As we left the dock, we had a report of
5-6 orcas
up near
Gabriola Island BC
. We got another 2nd hand report of whales "somewhere between Active Pass and Pt. Roberts." Still a lot of area, but smaller than before. So we headed towards
Eastpoint
to view the Steller Sea Lions, and had just made the corner when we stumbled upon
T18 and T19, T19B, and T19C
. As they passed offshore of Boiling Reef,
T19B
went into overdrive and started rooster-tailing a huge spray off his dorsal fin. Hunting!!!! 5-6 high speed zig zags and it was over, and the group had a nice little snack on a small harbor porpoise. After lunch, the whales seemed to be a bit more sedate and continued around the point and headed for Skipjack. We heard on the VHF that a large group of approximately
20 Transients
(I think the T100s and T102s were a part of that group) were quite aways behind us heading for Alden Bank. AND another group were up near the Bellchain Islands. At last count, this meant we had about
28 Transients
in the Strait of Georgia!

On Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon we headed up
Boundary Pass toward East Pt
. where transients had been spotted. The 1st group we encountered were
4 whales
, which included
T19B
(I could see three other whales with him & am assuming his constant companions T18, T19 and T19C, but I didn't get pictures of them for proof of presence.) We left them and headed toward Alden Bank. Just north of Sucia Island we encountered a 2nd group:
T124C, T124A, T124A2, T124A3 and T124A4
. We continued on and encountered a 3rd group:
T100, T100B, T100B1, T100C, T100E, T101, T101A, T101B, T102, T124, T124D, T124E, T124A1, T36, T36B,and T36B1
. They changed direction and the 2nd group and the 3rd group joined up heading back in the direction of Pt. Roberts. On our way home, traveling through Boundary Pass we encountered a 4th group:
T137, T137A and T137B.
A grand total of
28 killer whales
.

We saw
27 Transient Orcas
, an amazing number, on our
afternoon
trip into
Boundary Pass and the Strait of Georgia
.

We motored up President's channel and out into
Boundary Pass. East Point
came into view along with a giant dorsal fin. We waited in the mist and
3 more whales
came into view. It was looking as though we had encountered a pod of
Transient Orcas
. They were heading south so we turned around and headed south as well. They were moving in a fairly straight line when suddenly they stopped, turned and started rolling and diving. It looked as though a hunt had begun. We couldn't see much from the surface but a minute later the gulls moved in and swept the surface in search of scraps.

On Maya's Westside Charters in the morning we encountered a
gray whale
north or
Pollier Pass
, close to shore along
Gabriola Island
, heading northwest.

The Ocean Magic 12.15 trip settled for an elusive
Minke
off
Hein Bank
accompanied by a couple of harbour seals in tow. It was behaving just like a Minke with long dives and two to three breaths at the surface. Pic (see photo below) is heavily cropped to show the seals.

The
Minke
we saw at Hein Bank were very, very special. They are a
Cow and calf
(small enough to still appear to be dependent) on its mom. I understand the Adult has been a regular at Hein Bank formally called "Johnny Rotten. BUT She has been re-named Christy Hynde-Bank and her calf. First photographed on
May 20th by Prince of Whales and renamed by Jon Stern of the NE Pacific Minke Whale Project. I'm sure we will be able to view this pair all season. They are hard to spot. The female is shy with the calf and has erratic feeding patterns. She is all over the place every time she dives. She dives long and deep and she blows light, hard to spot. The (blow) is almost invisible in a gray sea.
