Orca Sightings for May 22, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We met up with
7 northbound transient orcas
in
Trincomali Channel
, at the south end of Wallace Island. Every orca encounter is magical, but the beautiful natural setting made this one even more memorable. Positive ID's were determined for
T101, T101A, T102, T23, T23C and T23D
. A very spunky calf that appeared to be about 1 year of age was swimming mostly with T23C, however, was also seen with T23 and with T102. The calf was showing off it's breaching, spyhopping and rolling skills. We even saw some spyhops from T102 or T101A - can't tell them apart from their headshots. As the group approached Porlier Pass, they hunted and ate at least two seals that they trapped along the steep walls of
Galiano Island
. The entire group then moved through Porlier Pass into Georgia Strait, and were last seen northbound along Valdez Island at approximately

1:45 pm
.

I confirmed that it was
T20 and T21
we saw in
Swanson Channel
between Village Bay and Navy Channel. We left them before we could see if they were continuing down Swanson or turning into Navy.

Photo taken from more or less the same place as the grays were taken a couple of weeks or so ago (few miles south of
Big Sur CA
from Highway 1), one
mother and calf humpback
swam by - further out to sea, so not as good "into the water" shots, but forwarded on regardless.

9 pm: 2 Orca
were seen in the Surge Narrows area (Beazely Pass). No direction. Passed on from Jack,
Campbell River BC

A group of
4 Transients
that were just moving past
Eagle Point, San Juan Island
! No one knew they were there. Soon though they were heading out southwest towards the ODAS buoy. We were moving up the Canadian side of Haro and were almost to Gooch Island when Captain Ivan (aka Whale Whisperer) saw a large dorsal fin about 3 miles ahead of us. A glance about 1/2 mile towards
Moresby Island
and another small dorsal fin. Soon it was joined by another and another and another--another group of
Transients
and before long we were able to positively ID the whales as the
T10s
, along with 2 additional Transients (again, my ID powers on Transients is a bit limited so I'll send it to CWR or Jeanne Hyde for confirmation on the "extra" whales). But this group, unlike the earlier group, was in no hurry to go anywhere...and we soon discovered why. This group kept making slow, lazy direction changes, and as the sun glare cleared the water for a moment, we saw a Harbor Seal amidst the orcas. Soon however, he was dragged underwater and we didn't see him for the rest of the encounter, so we assumed lunch had been had.

On the late
afternoon
trip on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered
T10, T10B, T10C, T26 and T26A
as they traveled south in
Haro Strait
. We left them west of Kelp Reef traveling southwest.

Heading south from Friday Harbor, we had word that a potential transient pod was seen off
Middle Bank
and was headed further out towards the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
. A pod of
four to five unidentified transients
were on the move, surfacing for several breaths and then diving as a group for two to three minutes at a time. A small calf was seen with the pod, with 1-2 males and 2-3 females and/or juveniles.

Straight of Georgia

All day long, the same group of Transient Orca which included
T019B T018 and T023
were almost down to
Powell River
. The closest they got was around Grant's Reef, just South of Sentry Shoal. This morning the Whale Watching boats caught up with them just inside Discovery Channel by Cape Mudge. So they didn't go very far. They did take a couple of Sea Lions close to Mittlenatch Island.

7 am
: first report of around
10 Orca
by Sentry Shoal thought to be headed Southward. 9 am: Discovery Channel by Duncan Bay
5 Orca
were reported. 7 Orca reported Southbound close to Cape Mudge around the same time. These reports from Jack, Campbell River Whale Watching, Jeff "FogHorn" (I believe he's in one of the Oak Bay Hurricane boats), and Garry, Aboriginal Journeys. Jeff picked 5 of them up by the can buoy off Mudge at
9:30 am slowly heading towards Mittlenatch Island down the Strait. By the time Aaron got out, they were closer to Hernando Island at
11:30 am where they were splashing and being quite active. They continued their very slow movement Southward.

2:20 pm
the count was
6 Transients
between Mittlenatch and Sentry Shoal slowly aiming towards Rebecca Rocks, just off
Powell River
. They seemed to stay in that general area with tail lobs, breaches and general splashes after another kill. Garry's was the last whale watching boat to leave them there.
