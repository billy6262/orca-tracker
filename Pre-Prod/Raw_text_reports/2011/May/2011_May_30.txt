Orca Sightings for May 30, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered
T20 and T21
off
Discovery Island B.C
. The whales were traveling slowly and heading south west. The encounter ended a mile east of Discovery Island.
Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, WA
*
Transient orcas T20 and T21
spotted at
Discovery Island
at about

1:30pm
. There were two groups of porpoises milling around within 300 yards of the two transients, but no interest in an afternoon snack was displayed.

We found our whales right where they were supposed to be: still off
Discovery Island
. These
orcas
were in a pod of two and with the help of another whale watching vessel, they were identified at the transients
T20 and T21
. T20 is a large male and T21 is a fairly large female, both estimated to be in their forties and known to travel together. After twenty minutes of watching them zigzag with long down times, we got word of another species of whale in the area: a gray whale.

: The
5 Transient Orca

Raza Island, B.C
.

11:15 am: 5 Orca
spotted by Subtle Islands near Whaletown, Cortez Island heading North towards Channel Islands - back and forth changing directions. First reported by Jeff, Fog Horn, running a tour out of Painter's Lodge. It wasn't long after that Garry, Aboriginal Journeys picked the Transients up heading towards Coulter Bay. Garry was with them for quite a while with his tour as they tail slapped, breached and took a seal or Sea Lion. The Orca slowly worked their way up to Raza Island and were still heading in a Northerly direction at 4 pm when Garry left them. See the rest of the evening report above.

On Maya's Westside Charters at

2:00 p.m.
we observed
T20 and T21
less than a mile off
Discovery Island
. T20 and T21 had been in the same area since being spotted at about noon. I learned late in the day that a few visitors to Lime Kiln Pt. State Park had seen two whales passing by Lime Kiln at about
10:00 a.m. That could not be confirmed, however, the locations and the time would make it possible that they may have seen T20 and T21. After leaving T20 and T21 we traveled toward Zero Rock to see a
gray whale
that another boat had come across. The gray whale was heading south toward Discovery Island.

Glassy calm, south
Haro Strait
at
1400-1500hours
, 1 mile SE of Seabird/Discovery Island,
Transient orcas T87 and T88
meandering at 4knots. He has a new scar line on his right side near top of fin where the cut out is ; still pink and ragged.

About
6 PM
this evening, with the tide way in, a single
gray whale
was feeding close along the
Mabana
shore (SW Camano Island), heading south.
Barbara Brock, Camano Island, WA

After leaving T20 and T21 (see above report) we traveled toward Zero Rock to see a
gray whale
that another boat had come across. The gray whale was heading south toward
Discovery Island
.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island, WA
*
Just north of the Transients (Discovery Island) 5 miles (see above report), a small juvie
gray whale
coming south at 3 knots
1550
hours/HaroStrait/ D'Arcy Island heading southward.
Deb Martyn,naturalist for Orcas Eclipse Charter/Orcas Express
*
Five miles to the north (of
Discovery Island
), we saw a larger bushier blow (whale breath!) and eventually we saw the
gray whale
that belonged to that blow.

6 pm
received a call from Steve G., my eagle eye neighbour, that he spotted some
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
between Texada and
Powell River
. There were between 20 to 30 of them performing some of their noteworthy leaps as they zig zagged in a foraging / feeding pattern slowly working their way North-West. Around
7:30 pm I lost them as they changed direction, yet again, and blended into the shadows close to Harwood Island shoreline. I picked them up again, as noted above, slowly heading into Georgia Strait between Rebecca Rock and Harwood Island. It's now
8:30 pm and can no longer spot them.

5 pm

Dalls Porpoises
were putting on quite a show at the top of Raza Island.

We were on the
Edmonds/Kingston ferry
around
5 p.m.
and saw a large group of what I am assuming were
Dalls Porpoises
to the North (or possibly Harbor porpoise? - see last report below). Could only see their dorsal fins (short and dark in color). Seemed to be moving fairly quickly and like I said, there seemed to be quite a few of them. Yay!

10 am
: Around 10 playful
Dalls Porpoises
were bow and wake riding with Jeff, Painter's Lodge by Chatham Point at the entrance to
Johnstone Strait
.

We saw
Transient orcas T20 and T21
off Discovery Island on Monday. As noted by an earlier report, there were a lot of porpoises in the Ts' immediate vicinity, but they didn't show any interest the porpoises that we could see. They were moving at a much more leisurely pace than when we saw them in Swanson Channel on
May 24.
