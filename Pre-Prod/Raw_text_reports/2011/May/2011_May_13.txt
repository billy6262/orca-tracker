============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Debbie Sharpe, Kira Kranzler, and Mercedes Powell of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor at
10:50 a.m. with a report of transients just off of Discovery Island, B.C. Approximately seven miles east of Seabird Point (48째 20.83 N,123째 05.77 W) at

11:35 a.m
. we found the group of seven transients traveling slowly in a tight group, heading south west. The group included
T75, T75A, T73B and the T77s
. We were with the group for several hours as they zigzagged their way south west into the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Our encounter ended at

2:01 p.m.
with the whales still headed south (48째 16.93 N, 123째 08.21 W).

Tonight around
7 p.m
. as we watched cruise ships head to Alaska we spotted a pod of
Orcas
. It looked like a male, two females and two calfs. As they headed nouth toward
Marrowstone Point
, we thought that was it but then spotted a lone Orca possible transient and then to our surprise another pod of 4 or 5 although my husband thought maybe 6. They were swimming north coming up out of the water quickly and at one point there was some play going on but mostly moving north at a pretty good clip. Not sure if they were eating because they didn't seem to dive long. They were about a mile out from our shore line on Marrowstone Island just south of East Beach. The cruise ships were also in the shipping lanes so they were closer to Marrowstone then Whidbey.

Orca pod
at
Pt. No Point lighthouse
right now (
~5 pm
)! It seemed like a large group, but difficult to tell how many exactly - maybe about 12 or so, a couple large males in the group and a couple calves as well. They were about 100 yards off shore from the lighthouse and put on a great show for about 15-20 minutes before moving north towards Port Townsend. Lot's of breaching!!!

4-5 orcas
headed south at

8:04
this morning.

The Ocean Magic vessel out of Victoria met up with a number of
Transients
(looked like 7-8) who appeared to be in a traveling group much of the time, Friday afternoon. We located them south west of
Hein Bank
close to

1:15pm
. They did zigzag in different directions at times but didn't appear to be hunting. The research vessel out of the Centre for Whale Research kept company with these magnificent Orca. A pair of Tufted Puffins floating on the calm water helped make this a very special day.

Transients

Leaving Friday harbor we had reports of
transients
around
Hein Bank
moving southwest. We cruised in to the area of Hein Bank about an hour and a half later and realized that the whales had made some distance towards
Port Angeles
. We got a few good looks at the group of about 6 whales. There was a very identifiable male with a tall dorsal that kind of curved at the top. There was also a very recognizable calf in the mix.
