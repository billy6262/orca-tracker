Orca Sightings for May 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Mercedes Powell, and Kira Kranzler from the Center for Whale Research observed a group of
transients
heading north from
Bellevue point, San Juan Island
. We departed Snug Harbor at
12:17pm and encountered the group of transients, containing
T87, T90, T90B and T90C
, just outside of Mitchell Bay at

12:27 p.m.
(48째 32.60 N, 123째 10.53 W), still moving slowly north. At
1:21pm we observed a harbor seal in the whales path. Shortly thereafter the whales were milling where the seal had been, presumably having made a kill, although we were unable to see any physical evidence. The transients continued to move slowly north until

2:19pm
, when they turned and headed south west. At
2:50pm our encounter ended approximately three quarters of a mile south east of Kelp Reef, with the whales moving south west down the middle of the Straight (48째 31.85 N, 123째 12.81 W).

As you may know from the Hydrophone recordings last night we ran into about
6-10 killer whales
around

17:10
just off the
Neah Bay
jetty and around Wa'adah Island! They were traveling East and appeared to be feeding, lots of surface activity and slow movements and dives. At least two males with large dorsals with the group.

7 Transient

Seymour Narrows
around
12 pm
. No direction given.

I am at Bliss Landing. We have been watching a pod of
five Orcas
for the last few weeks. They showed up the Saturday before Easter and have been around every few days since then. The seals in the area are very afraid and come into our docks when they are near. We shot some video of the pod a few days ago which I will try to send today.

Heard about 8 faint
calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones at
11:03 am
-- over a minute or so. Wasn't quick enough on record button to get them all, but WhoListener recorded two calls - listen here.

11:00 a.m.
Lime Kiln Pt. State Park
, whales apx 1/4 mile from shore, 4 transient orcas were traveling up island. They made a kill in
front of the lighthouse. They continued to move very slowly north. T87, T90, T90B and a calf - I'm assuming T90C (but I'm not sure). In the afternoon on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered the same whales continuing their slow travel up island. They made a 90 degree turn offshore along Henry Island and then changed direction several times. We last saw them on the west side of Haro Strait heading down. I'll post pictures on my blog.

For the second day in a row we found ourselves in
Haro Strait
. It was another beautiful, glassy day on the water and as we rounded the northwestern corner of San Juan Island we could see blows to the south. There were
4 Orca whales
. There was one big male with a huge, notched dorsal that was bent over slightly to the left at the very top. There were also two smaller whales (one presumably a female/mother) and a calf in the pod. We watched them dive and maneuvered out alongside of what seemed to be the direction the whales were taking. About 5 minutes later we found out we were wrong. The whales popped up almost a mile southwest of where they dove. A few surface breaths and they dove again. We sat in the same spot; reluctant to advance because of the previous direction change. The next time the whales surfaced to the east, back toward San Juan. We sat for about 15 minutes and watched them mill. Through the binoculars we could see Dall's Porpoise right next to the whales! We waited in anticipation for what would surely be lunch. The whales did a 180 and headed back toward Canada. Apparently they were not interested. Lucky Dall's. With the lighting at a better angle we got a good look at the adult dorsal fins and at the little calf.

A nice quiet morning. We had a handful of
orcas
, including at least one adult male and one calf slowly traveling east-to-west off Flint Beach, headed toward Iceberg Point,
~
6:30 am
. Thanks for including the picture of T87's dorsal in this mornings email. That was definitely the male that I saw.
