Orca Sightings for May 27, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
A good looking
Minke whale
was observed at
Hein Bank
. I forwarded it to the Minke guru in San Francisco, and apparently it has a name ' Nick Jagger ' according to Jonathan Stern. It appears to be a familiar whale for this area.

We started to see vessels off the east side of
Saturna Island
. Not far from those vessels were five black dorsal fins belonging to
five transient orca
whales! As we observed this pod, we noticed that all of the dorsal fins were crescent-moon shaped, each belonging either a female or a juvenile (male or female) and one of these dorsal fins belonged to a very small orca: a baby. Upon our first approach, we noticed several gulls circling overhead. Had the pod just taken a harbor seal or Steller sea lion with the gulls scavenging for scraps? We were still not certain. The transient group began heading south and then north and then random circles, moving rapidly at first and then slowly. The calf began acting up somewhat with fluke up dives, head stands and a semi-spy hop with its head clearing the water. As we ran out of time, the pod was still milling about and Bald Eagles were circling overhead. The pod was identified by another vessel as the
T100s
.
