Orca Sightings for May 12, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
20+ Transient Orcas
right off
Tumbo Island, BC
. Left them at

6:30
headed West back up the island. Many breeches and above the surface vocalizations.

On Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon, after receiving a call, we headed north and west to the north side of
Galiano Island
, B.C. where we encountered
T20 and T21
heading east at

3:00
. Farther east another boat came across
T137, T137A and T137B
. T137C was not present. Another boat was about 3 miles northwest of our location, returning to Vancouver, and came across
several other whales
. We did not see those whales and left the scene at
3:40. We made a return trip and at
5:35 encountered the same whales. However, this time many more whales approached from the west and joined the others. There was quite a lot of above water vocalizing and extraordinary surface action. The whales present included some of the same whales that were photographed at Lions Gate Bridge, Vancouver, B.C. Wednesday. The whales ID'd on the late encounter were:
T20, T21, T137, T137A, T137B, T100, T100B, T100B1, T100C, T100E, T101, T101A, T101B, T102, T18, T19, T19B, T19C, T23, T23D, T26 and T26A
. There was a total of
22 whales
identified and possibly one or two more.

We soon got word of a
humpback
near Porlier Pass, and located it in
Trincomali Channel
, just south of the pass. This humpback was not exhibiting usual behaviour though. It was surfacing fast, and milling erratically, with just 1 breath per surface sequence and no long, lazy blow. Perhaps it knew what we were about to find out - transient orcas were in the Georgia Strait, and some were near. We headed out of the pass, and slightly south in
Georgia Strait
for an encounter with
T20 and T21
. These two individuals are sighted frequently in the area, and just continued on their way south, in typical transient fashion, during our encounter with them. Heading home across the strait, we encountered another 4 individuals - the T101's and T102. This group was also headed south in Georgia Strait. Watching them, we noted how tall T101A's fin is becoming, although still juvenile compared to T102. As we left them to head for dock at approximately
15:20, we heard that there were yet more transients in Active Pass. Seals, watch out! In answer to an individuals' question about seals and transients in Active Pass (asked in a previous report), I have seen them taking seals in the pass, and I've seen some very nervous seals when they pass through, so I doubt there is any agreement in place. Probably has more to do with whether the whales had already eaten, or perhaps this person is more often watching resident orcas pass through. The seals know the difference and don't budge when the residents pass by.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries reports they were able to get out with the
orcas
as they came out of
Admiralty Inlet
heading around Point No. Point this
afternoon
. They confirmed the pod as members of
J pod
, very spread out, doing a slow loop first toward Meadowdale, then they headed north, then west, then southwest and finally were heading south as they left them in the early evening. At one point they found J26 about three miles in front of the rest of the whales! The orcas were doing a lot of foraging, which is encouraging, and Brad was able to collect 6+ fecal samples, which will provide important information on what the whales were foraging on, among other things.

~
4:30 pm
: Spotted an
orca or two
off in the distance through binoculars. Its definitely them -- just saw the first confirmed spout and a small breach. They are somewhere just north of the
Kingston-Edmonds ferry
now. Still making their way south - Looking like they are slightly favoring the Kingston / President's Point side so far. Also, doesn't seem like a very large pod - maybe 5-6 from what I can see here in Richmond Beach. If it is J, most of them haven't shown up yet.
~
5:45 pm
: Here comes another group, further north, again up towards Kingston-Edmonds ferry lane, heading south. Looks like they might be J after all! I was able to make out a breach near the "SF" mid-channel buoy about 5 minutes ago.
~
6:45 pm
: I think they are milling a bit north of mid-channel now. I keep seeing shiny whale bodies in the water, but no evident direction.
~
6:50 pm
: Still milling about 0.5-1 mile north of mid-channel. And suddenly back on the move, heading south! Making their way
slowly south again.

5:45 pm
: I am above
Shilshole
and spotted a few
orcas
mid channel. One looked to be in northward movement.
~
6:45 pm
: I saw a few breaches, blows and the one dorsal when I was up above the marina.

orca
!

Patty Michak called at
1 pm
to report the
orcas
were passing
Pt. No Point
, heading south close in to the Lighthouse.
*
After receiving the report below, we headed over to the west side of Whidbey Island and found the
orcas
in
Admiralty Inlet
off
Lagoon Pt
at

10:05 am
, heading south - looks like J pod but too far off to confirm. We watched the orcas pass Bush Pt heading south from

10:50-
11:10 am, traveling spread out closer to the other side - no IDs yet.

John Rogstad at WA State Ferries called with a report of
3 groups of orcas
, at least 12, heading south in Admiralty Inlet from the
Pt. Townsend/Keystone Ferry
lanes at

9:06 am
this morning.

We got a call about [
orcas
] north west of Active Pass. A few minutes later we saw two whales surface a quarter mile behind us. It looked like a mom and calf. They were cruising. We turned around and tried to catch up parallel to the whales but they were moving fast. We noticed a single whale in closer to shore and then saw it turn toward the two whales we were watching. The duo did a 180 and became very surface active. Lots of twisting and turning with tails in the air. Eventually the single caught up and then we noticed blood in the water. Not sure what exactly it was but it looked to have been something large and delicious. Once again the whales continued on their eastern course. We watched for a while and then headed home, happy and slightly sunburned.
