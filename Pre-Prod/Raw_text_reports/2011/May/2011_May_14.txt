Orca Sightings for May 14, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J pod
a few miles north of Pile Point on the west side of
San Juan Island
at

4:52 p.m
. The whales were spread out in groups heading north. Ken followed the whales just past Lime Kiln State Park and then turned back south. The encounter ended just north of where it started.

I saw Granny and Spieden off of Lime Kiln at
5 pm
today along with Samish, Princess Angeline, Tsuchi and the rest of
J pod
! They were mostly just heading north, a little bit of direction change and milling but off
Hannah Heights
there was breaching, tail slaps and cartwheeling.

Just south of
Discovery Island
. We were with
J Pod
today near Victoria this
afternoon
. This evening they were near
Lime Kiln
. That's a US Navy ship in the background. No sonar problem today.

J Pod
slow travel east toward
San Juans
. We followed along across the Victoria waterfront

2:30 - 4 pm
, four or five groups swimming east 4-5 knots , kids rolling over each other, a few breaches and spyhops, J2, and J8 together.

Left Friday Harbor around
1:30 with reports of Southern Residents in the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
heading our way.
J-pod
was cruising steadily east. Our passengers were very excited to see multiple breaches, spyhops, tail slaps and some swimming on their backs. We were able to positively identify 'Mike' and 'Blackberry' out of the group. We had a lot of first time whale watchers on board so they got very spoiled with a great first encounter! On our way home we even encountered a
Minke Whale
!

11 am
a tug boat Captain spotted some
Orca
off in the distance when one breached and made a large splash. By
11:15 am the call was out one the radio that there were around 20 Whales by Marina Island, just off Cortez Island. It didn't take too long and then, by
2pm
the reports were that the Orca, including T10 T10B and T20 (based on reports from farther South it's doubtful that T20 is in two places at once - wonder who's right or did they move that far so quickly?) were zig zagging in three to four distinct groups within a triangle from Marina, Quadra and Read Islands. There were some on a kill by Viner point at the tip of Read Island. They stayed, spread out in that area until around 4 pm when they headed towards Whale Channel. At this point there was a count of around
25 Orca
! By the end of the day, the Campbell River Whale Watching crew left them at 5 pm entering Calm Channel by Rendezvous Islands. What a day - breaching, tail slapping and just lots of whale activity!.

We saw several nice
pods of Orca
with calfs(3+) off
Monterey Bay
on a whale watching tour. One group came within 5 feet of the boat.

We sighted the (
Transient orcas
) CA51s again in
Monterey Bay
today.
Nancy Black, Monterey Bay Whale Watch

I've got these two (re: photos from Peggy, below) in my notes as
CA51C
and the large male as
CA51B
. Looks like the same whales that got the gray whale calf on mother's day.
Kate Cummings, Blue Ocean Whale Watch, Monterey Bay, CA
*
There were
Orcas
in
Monterey Bay
today. There were
6 or 7 total animals
. Don't have a lot of information other than Kate Cummings said one of the whale watch boats saw the penis of one of the Orca.

I would like to report
2 Beautiful Humpbacks
my son and I witnessed at
0945
. They were in Stuart Channel (near
Crofton, BC
) Chart 3442. We joined them at Erskine Point (
Salt Spring Island
) and watched them cross to Grave pt and follow the shore to Sherard pt. They continued towards the direction of Porlier Pass. They were calm and serene each time taking 2 -3 breaths then a deep dive with tail fluke rising gracefully before descending. They appeared to be approximately the same size (adult). There is no mistake these were Humpback whales. I've seen thousands of different whales including whale watching guide. I didn't take pictures as I was video taping them.
