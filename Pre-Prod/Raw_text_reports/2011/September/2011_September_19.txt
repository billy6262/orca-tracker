Orca Sightings for September 19, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another sunny, beautiful September summer day, with a minimal ebbing tide and slack water, I think the whales enjoy it too!
J-Pod and L-Podders
spread out in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
from Salmon Bank to Middle Bank, all the way out to
Hein Bank
, a favored fish hunting region. From about

3:25pm until
4:30pm
, the Orcas were slowly milling about, making direction changes, chatting-vocalizing! Young, 16 year old J-30 Riptide and 21 year old L-84 Nyssa seemed to be goofing off, playing, and frisky, as they swam close together and we saw J-30 going on his back, flashing his 'pink floyd'! Maybe he was showing off, competing with L-84?!

We came across
L41
swimming by himself near
Hein Bank around 2pm
. Shortly after that we encountered more of L pod a little farther north, but a few miles offshore from South Beach, San Juan Island. Breaches, tail slaps, and spy hops. On the way in we stopped for Stellers at Whale Rocks, and a nice group of Harbor Porpoise in San Juan Channell!
