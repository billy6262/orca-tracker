Orca Sightings for September 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
The most exciting thing was seeing
4 [orcas] porpoising
. They were coming up behind the boat so we were able to see them for awhile as they came towards us and quickly passed by.
Blackberry
came by for awhile too and we had one orca breach right next to the boat at the back.

We rounded
Cattle Point
and started to see blows around Eagle Point. There were definitely
K's and maybe some J's
heading up the coast. Minutes later they were heading down the coast. They were spread from us in toward the rocks and on the other side, miles out toward the Olympics. Salmon were leaping everywhere and although there may have been some hunting taking place, one group with baby K and several other juveniles seemed to be enjoying a mid-afternoon play session. One juvenile breached about 10 times in a row!

Likely is a record of this already but for the just in case - looks like, at 32,
T002B has her first known calf
. Images over several surfacings over
1:13 show them surfacing together.
