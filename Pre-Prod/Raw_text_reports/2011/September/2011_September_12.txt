Over the years I have noticed something about the Orcas, porpoise, migrating marine birds, Steller Sea Lions, Harbor Seals and pups, all the life of the Salish Sea, that September is special. We see more gatherings of the pods, more active above surface behaviors, in some of the warmest, nicest conditions. Are the whales well fed from the spring and summer salmon? Are they planning their expanded travels to find enough salmon to sustain them in the fall and winter? Are they socializing, saying their goodbyes, like we are to them? Off of
Hein Bank
in a fairly strong 7' flooding tide at about

4:00pm to
4:30pm
, we were awed by
J-Pod, K-Pod, and some L-Pod
families energetically spyhopping, breaching, cartwheeling, headstands-tail flukes held in the air!, tail fluke lobbing and slapping the water, pectoral fin slaps on the surface, and some whales moving upside down on their backs!! Wonderful to see
J-2
, 100 year old Granny just as active, and hear their chatter on the hydrophone. The kitten like K vocalizations are distinct and J's S-1 call! We saw salmon jumping out of the water on our way back in, so hope the whales found the kings- Chinook Salmon, and are feasting well!

On our way home from fishing Saturday night we suddenly found ourselves surrounded by
5 (or so) gorgeous orcas
. We took this at

7:10 pm, 200 yards south of Bush Point lighthouse
in Admiralty Inlet. They fished for a while, slowly making their way southeast across the channel, until the sun set and we had to skedaddle home.
