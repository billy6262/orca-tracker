Orca Sightings for September 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was late in the day, or at least felt like it. Everyone had left but one boat well to the south with a humpback. We shut down and did our
1700
count. Jaeda noticed a female trailing the last group we had watched pass by. The group with young ones was very active. There were other whales to the north and south of us
all heading west
, except for moments of surface activity and fishing. Since we had seen L-92 pass along that line a mile or so ahead, we thought she was the most likely candidate. We moved in to check on her, and yes, it was
L-90 swimming alone steadily
.

Superpod
super spread out, we were hanging with some L's - positive id on
L92, L54 and L117
. Then! on our way back to victoria we were lucky enough to run into
some T's
not far from Trial Island!! No id on them but some of our guests said they'd email us their photos. Great day! We were very lucky :)

Concerning my moms Wendy Pinnow post earlier, I talked to her and we have come to a conclusion that
the whale she saw with the orcas was indeed a humpback
, 15 foot long pecs with bumps on the edges and a small lump of a dorsal fin fits the description. She was concerned of odd behavior as it looked like it was behaving like it was stressed. When she last saw it, it was heading south
following the resident orcas
. Could it be Canuck struggling to still get free from the fishing gear? Did any of the whale watching boats see the humpback with the orcas today?

Hydrophone reports

9:22am
- still hearing intermittent calls & echolocation on LimeKiln hydrophone, calls been streaming for past hour. Have heard what sounds like calls from all 3 pods during that time (hoping Wendy's possible humpback sighting is accurate, would be nice to hear a humpback too).

At

6:20 pm
yesterday I encountered
7 transient killer whales - the CA51s
- about 3 miles off the
Los Angeles Harbor
. This matriline, including 2 small calves, is often VERY boat friendly. A sea lion was taking refuge under the whalewatching boat Christopher, and then switched to our boat, pressing against the hull. Several whales repeatedly spyhopped - especially the calves. They rested and rolled nearby, making long dives as the sea lion peered downward. When the sea lion drifted from our boat a few times, the killer whales immediately approached it. One juvenile breached on it and tail-slashed; the sea lion immediately returned to the safety of our boat. The transients ignored a fast-moving group of common dolphin that passed nearby. When we left them due to darkness, the killer whales and sea lion were still there.
