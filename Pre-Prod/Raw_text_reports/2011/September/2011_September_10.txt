Orca Sightings for September 10, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
L pod in all of its glory. Our whale encounter began with
Mega
. We were just south of eagle point with no other whale watching boats in sight and out of no where a huge dorsal fin came to the surface. We stopped and waited to see where he was headed. He was moving south toward us so we shut down and waited. It was glassy flat, calm and quiet until his exhalation cut the silence like a jet engine. He meandered in our direction and then slowly swooped around and took a 90 degree turn out away from us. He milled back and forth for a while until he was several hundred yards away from us. We started up again and continued north. Up toward the north end of
San Juan
we encountered the rest of the pod. They were very spread out. They looked to be fishing. There was some surface activity here and there but with long dive times. We got a few looks at a couple of females and juveniles and one other large male.

Lime Kiln hydrophones -

1:45 - Southern Residents
, S16 (K pod) and other calls and lots of loud clicks now at Lime Kiln hydrophones. No detections earlier at Orcasound, so they are likely northbound.

Arlene Solomon called from Mayne Island to say there were
six orcas headed north into Active Pass
.
*
We spotted a small pod of about
5 or 6 orcas
all females and young ones. One calf was so small and appreared grey in colour. I can't find any info on grey infant orcas. Is this common for newborns? The time was

5:30
. The orcas were heading east towards
Race Rocks
and sticking within feet from shore. We noticed the large female would stop moving for a minute or so and just float. Is this possibly nursing the calf?
