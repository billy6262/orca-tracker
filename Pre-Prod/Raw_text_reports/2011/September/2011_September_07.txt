Orca Sightings for September 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
The whales were about 1.5 miles south of
False Bay
, basically making a giant circle as they milled about. There were two distinct groups, and
Js and Ks
were interspersed between the groups. We saw J28 Polaris and her calf J46 Star swimming alongside J30 Riptide J22 and her clan, J34 Doublestuff and J38 Cookie were also in this same group. The other group had
L87
Onyx (honorary J Pod member) hanging out with
K21, K25
and lots of K females. We also saw
J26 Mike and J27
Blackberry swimming about. The whale groups would coalesce and separate and then come back together again. The water was flat calm, so you could hear the blows from a long distance away. We saw 3-4 spyhops, but what was intriguing was the whales would make almost choreographed turns but we never heard them make a call, so we wondered what the non-verbal signal (or out of range of our hydrophone?) they were using. The whales pretty much held this pattern for about an hour before deciding to head towards shore. Since we limit our time with whales to no more than 1/3 of our trip time (so about an hour and 10 minutes max), it was perfect timing for us to head back. There were also reports of the T30s about 4-5 miles further south of the SRKWs but we didn't have time to head over to see them this trip. Lots of Stellar Sea Lions on Whale Rocks now as would be expected (more than 20), and they were fun to watch as they growled and snarled at one Stellar who had had enough swimming and was ready for some sun bathing.

We had an amazing encounter with
resident whales
today that started with them spread out all over the south west side of the island, merging into small groups, and ended with them meeting up, West Side Story style (without the violence), and then all swimming off into the sunset together. There were somewhere between 20 and 30 whales out there. We identified K's (baby in tow) and J's (Blackberry and L87 were hanging together with a bunch of juveniles and females).
