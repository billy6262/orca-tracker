Orca Sightings for September 21, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of all the pods, J-K-L
, out in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
, off of San Juan Island, between

3:10pm to
4:25pm
. We identified the big guy sighted first; L-41 Mega with sister L-77 Matia, heading toward Salmon Bank. They turned back and we noticed L-25 Ocean Sun. Well, 83 year old L-25 Ocean Sun jumped out of the water, she breached 2 times!! A magical moment... We see a group closer to shore porpoising, speed swimming, had they all decided to travel northwest? Then some L-Podders closer to shore, lunging, hoping they caught a Chinook Salmon! We are also listening to J-K-L vocalizations, with the lighting and wildlife an extraordinary encounter!

We just got back from a 5 day kayak trip in the
Southern Gulf Islands
today. I wanted to report an Orca sighting. On Wednesday morning the 21st we were paddling around Taylor Pt on Saturna Island when we spotted a couple distant Orcas to the east. After watching for about a minute, we proceeded on in and landed at the beach inside the point. We then climbed up the stone stairs and followed the path out to Taylor Point hoping to spot more whales. It was around 11AM. Once we got out into full view numerous Orcas were feeding in the vacinity of Java Islets. For the next 15 minutes we watched what must have been a pod of about 20 whales feed...probably on salmon. They gradually moved in a westerly direction heading into Plumper Sound and out of sight. I would be curious which pod we might have seen?

We had a report of
J pod
heading south in Haro Strait a little later that day, so that's probably who you saw.

We encountered
4 transients off Hein Bank around
12:30 pm
, one male and 3 females, heading south-east, perhaps another visit to Puget Sound? Then we headed north-west and were accosted by
Dall's porpoise
, then found the
L12's coming south along SJI, very spread out, with L41, L79, L89, L94 and L113
easy enough to identify. They were still heading south when we left them around
3:30 or so. The weather was picture perfect, mill-pond like seas and beautiful clouds. Magic!

.

I went out with Island Adventures again today. We saw the
T30s west of Whidbey/south of Lopez
and then
L25 Ocean Sun, Skanna and Alexis off San Juan Island
. All of these photos are the T30s except the sideview spyhop, which is L25.

We left the harbor today and headed north. Half way up the San Juan Channel we encountered Dall's Porpoise. As we were leaving the Dall's we saw a large male ELEPHANT SEAL. The large, protruding nose was a dead giveaway. Out in Haro Strait we shut down and watched a small group composed of
J16, J26, and J42 and 36
. They looked to be just traveling. There were no long dives and their pace was slow and steady. We could hear each and every breath from whales near and far away from us. A single female surfaced off our other side and we watched her glide gracefully past us. There were so many whales in all directions that we dropped our hydrophone to take a listen. It was as if we had stepped into the middle of a crowded party. It was so calm that we could even hear echolocation clicks. While we were sitting, watching, and listening to the orcas something big exploded to the surface about a quarter of a mile away from us. It was like watching a submarine shooting to the surface. It happened two more times. In that time I was able to gather my wits and identify the large, torpedo-like object as
a breaching Minke Whale
! I have never seen a Minke breach before. It was awesome!

Saw a large group
(25 or so) of Harbor porpoises
about 200m off of Suquamish Monday morning. They had been milling about there for about an hour according to others who were watching them. They were gone later that afternoon when I passed through there.

We received a report from Colleen Bennett of
3 - 4, possibly more, orcas on the south side of Mendocino, CA
heading south on Sept. 21st.
