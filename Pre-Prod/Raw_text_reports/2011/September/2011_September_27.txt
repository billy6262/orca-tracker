After 2 days of howling wind and sporadic downpours it seemed as though mother nature decided to give us a break. It was a beautiful day. There was sun and there were whales. We even saw
a Minke
surface as we were watching Steller's Sea Lions at the south end of Cattle Pass. The
residents
were spread out on the south/ west side of the island. They looked to be moving a little bit offshore but were generally milling when we arrived. The first whale we encountered was
L21
traveling (or hunting) with a female and juvenile male. There were whales everywhere but toward the end of the trip we ended up with a group that included K20.

Note: The Center for Whale Research was with K pod on
September 28 and did not see a new calf.
