My my what a day! Dense fog, heading West on a hunch, finding
Transient Orcas, Resident Orcas, and two Humpbacks
. I've never seen such fog, lasting all day long. I had heard from my buddies from Victoria that the skies were clear out West, and that if we got there we might be able to see a Humpback. So, after delaying our departure for an hour, and proceeding with great care through the pea soup fog, we headed for Victoria. Finally the fog lifted and out near Race Rocks we got our reward. First we saw two Transients, the mammal eating Orcas. Then we went to see two Humpbacks. Then we spent the rest of our time with the Super Pod, Js, Ks and Ls as they headed toward San Juan Island. And we were the only boat from the San Juans. An amazing day!
