Orca Sightings for September 13, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Awesome day with both
humpys and Orca's
. Morning spent with
J's and K's
by
point no point BC
(west of Sooke in Strait of Juan de Fuca), we had breaches, cartwheels and even a baby breach!... and spent the afternoon with several different groups of humpy's south of Race Rocks, who were doing great flukeing and a great breach from one of them too :)
