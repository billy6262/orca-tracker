Orca Sightings for June 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had a bus-full of folks hoping to see whales. Much to our delight, as we rounded the "million dollar" corner, at

11:25 am
, the
orcas
were there, spread out to Lime Kiln Point State Park, slowly heading north! Then at

3:30 pm
, we saw another group of
orcas
heading south down Haro Strait, part of L pod?

So special to see the
orcas
cruising past the south end of Lopez. Pod of at least 20 orcas came past this morning about
8am
, pod was dispersed, many breaches, traveling the standard east to west route.

A-24's spotted in Nodales Channel heading west into Johnstone Strait by Darren "Tide" . Springer very playful, full of life and doing well.

(In response to a report we relayed in our last email of the A-24's with Springer heading into Johnstone Strait, we received this correction: - your source misidentified the whales. The A8s were the 4 whales that travelled from the Johnstone Strait area down east. No A73 with them.
