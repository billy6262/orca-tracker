Orca Sightings for June 28, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's
and about half the
L's
came across Haro from the west and turned up island at about

9:30 am
. The first group passed about an eighth to a quarter mile off shore, foraging as they went. Just as I started to leave because I had work that really needed to get done, I saw the second group close against the rocks--hence, I had to stay at least another half hour . The second group was mostly L's, with some J's in for good measure. They put on a spectacular show. J16 came thru inside of the the kelp with her little one, J42. Then they both started playing. J42 kept laying across mom's rostrum, then mom would tumble her around and throw her. As soon as J42 regained her balance, she would swim back onto mom's head. J16 would tumble her and throw her again. This kept up for several minutes. After J16 and J42 passed by, about 15 whales, including L41 and L57 came thru about 5 yards offshore, kelping, tail slapping, spyhopping, pec slapping, and generally carrying on. They continued along the rocks from Edwards Point to Lime Kiln Point, doing lots of tricks along the way. Great fun!
