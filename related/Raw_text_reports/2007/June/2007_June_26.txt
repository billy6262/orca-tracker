Orca Sightings for June 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched a very dispersed pod of about two dozen
orcas
travel east to west by Flint Beach (South Lopez Island) between

7:00 and
7:45 am
. They clearly had places to go and didn't linger, though I did see one nice breach.
