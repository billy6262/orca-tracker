Orca Sightings for June 8, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jessie Huggins and I conducted our monthly outer coast survey from Westport last Friday, 8
June 2007. It was one of the nicest days I have spent out there, and a good day for baleen whales. We sighted 9
humpbacks
in scattered groups of 1-3 whales 10-20 miles off shore, and one just inside the jetties at Grays Harbor. We saw 10-15
gray whales
in an aggregation 13 miles off the coast near Moclips. As part of this survey we do an offshore transect parallel to the coast about 40nm offshore, following the edge of the continental shelf. There were lots of resting Northern Fur Seals out there in the deep water, including one that approached our boat quite closely. Evidently the boat looked like a more comfortable place to sleep than the kelp it was wrapped up in! We also saw a few small groups of Dall's porpoise, which we hadn't been seeing on our recent early spring/late winter outer coast surveys.

At

7:00 this evening
, in wonderfully calm waters, we left
J Pod
headed east from the shore of South Beach, SJI, to a mile off shore. The all seemed in great spirits, with a lot of breaching and other social activities.

It's about

4:30pm
and the
J's
just headed North past Hannah Heights (approx 1 mile from Lime Kiln on the west side of SJI). We had been at the light earlier during a northbound pass when I was amazed to see Granny and Spieden riding the wake of a large boat ahead of them. Great porpoising going on along with a some breaching and lots of pec slapping by some of the little ones. Eventually they turned after a double breach, headed south and I caught back up with them at Hannah Heights as they were headed back up north in one big shuffle. And the much beloved matriarch was still porpoising. It's the most activity I've seen from these guys during an afternoon in a while!

Inside of Iceberg Point, Lopez Islands, a
HUMPBACK WHALE
was in the quiet bay. We were able to see it blow several time and see its massive tail flukes. The humpback even treated the guests with a FULL BREACH.

I just returned from a two day trip to Neah Bay. Over the past two days we saw 5 gray whales feeding close to shore, probably on the Mysid shrimp. There were at least three whales just outside of the breakwater of Neah Bay. Another couple of whales (one was calf) were south of Neah bay, feeding near Seal Rock.
