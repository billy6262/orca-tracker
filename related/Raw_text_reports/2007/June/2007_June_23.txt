Center for Whale Research staff observed
transient
male T14 traveling slowly northbound and occassionally milling near D'Arcy island in Sidney Channel at

3:42 pm
. During the encounter several Harbor porpoises were observed in the vicinity of T14, and at one point birds were seen diving at the surface after the transient male passed, leading staff to believe T14 made a kill beneath the surface and birds were presumably diving on scraps. Following nearly two hours of detailed observations staff then witnessed T14 engage in circling and lunging several times after prey. Staff observed T14 successfully catch a Harbor porpoise and subsequently return to travelling northbound with the animal carried in his mouth. T14 made another circling lunge effort just 15 minutes later, though no prey was observed. Staff ended the encounter at
6 pm
in Sidney Channel as T14 continued traveling slowly northbound.

We had just arrived at Pt No Pt west of Sooke on the southern portion of Vancouver Island Saturday when we spotted a pod of
orcas
travelling east a few hundred yards off shore, about
4pm
ish, several breaching.

A CG helicopter out of Astoria observed a
humpback
whale in position 46-50.52N 124-33.46W on Saturday afternoon. Pictures were not taken as the whale surfaced and immediately went back under water. Also, a CG helicopter out of
North Bend, OR
spotted a pod of
Orcas
Saturday morning. There were at least 5 of them and at least one juvenile among them. They were moving north just offshore in position 45-07.3/124-00.5.

As it starts getting dark (

9:34 PM
), I'm listening to the hydrophones at Lime Kiln. What a great racket going on!
J's & L's
were inbound a few hours ago, and it sounds like quite the party going on at the lighthouse! I think I even heard a breach near the array (huge splashing sound).

Ron Bates of the Marine Mammal Research Group called to report most of
L pod
inbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, heading toward San Juan Island at

7:30 pm
.
*
The 4
L12's
went west this morning according to reports.
J's
came up island from the south starting at about noon and then did the west side shuffle for hours. They ended up around Salmon Bank at about
6pm
as reports of all of
L pod
coming east from Beechey Head started coming in. The J's and L's are probably having a wonderful party right now somewhere in the straits, when it's too dark to see them.
