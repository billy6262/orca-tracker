Orca Sightings for June 10, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm sure you"ll get plenty of cool reports about
J pod
this
morning
- they were definitely full of action today. Caught up with them over at Lime Kiln after a painful wait and see on the west side of the island...smiles. But it was worth the wait. While they were not horribly close to shore--- a large group of 12-17(maybe more) lined up just around Deadman's Bay and stayed traveling together past the light. Lots of tail slaps, rolls and synchronized swimming- until they passed the light. That's when the show began. We counted 10 full breaches within the next minute that followed- all while they were still in a line swimming together! And it did not stop there- they broke up and headed a bit further off shore- tail slapping, rolling, breaching!

At
0730
this morning, Mark spotted some whales just southwest of Trial Island heading west so we mobilized and after a few false starts made it to some whales off Albert Head at about
1000
. We were a bit surprised to encounter the whales so close to the initial sighting as they were spread out in groups and heading quickly towards Race Rocks. We were able to get a few photos in between rain squalls. Here's the list of photo ID'd (and not photo- ID'd but visually confirmed) animals:
L21, L47, L83
L55, L82, L103, L109, L86, L106
L26, L92 (L90)
L95 (L72, L105)
L57 (L53, L7)
We left the whales heading west at Race Passage at around
1145
. Other reports indicate another group farther west that we did not encounter that may have contained L41, L73, and L74. This may have been the group that Mallard saw at 0730. That's about it!

J-Pod
swam up the west side of San Juan Island. J-1 Ruffles was leading the group, with the remainder of J-Pod spread out over 2-3 miles in small groups. We saw several foraging activities with lots of speed swimming and quick turn-arounds. Towards the end of the trip, we observed Robin Baird and the fecal follow research group with a small group of whales. Turns out it was J-26 Mike and J-16 Slick with J-36 and J-42. They were zig zagging around and were slowly passing by.
