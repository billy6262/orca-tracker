Orca Sightings for June 27, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
spent much of the day coming south from Bellingham Channel, down Rosario, around Lopez Island, past Cattle Pass to Salmon Bank, and finally at about
3 pm
, up the westside of San Juan Island. At

7:30pm
the J's were spread out from Eagle Point to Bellevue. I saw lots of foraging, direction changes, and generally doing what orcas do. J1 spent lots of time off Hannah and Land Bank feeding. When I left, whales were headed slowly in all directions-- north, south, inshore, offshore.
