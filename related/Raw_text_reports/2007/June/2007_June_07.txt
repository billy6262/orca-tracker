Orca Sightings for June 7, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
In Neah Bay in two days we saw 5 gray whales feeding close to shore, probably on the Mysid shrimp. There were at least three whales just outside of the breakwater of Neah Bay. Another couple of whales (one was calf) were south of Neah bay, feeding near Seal Rock.

Js
headed north this evening. We left them at the mouth of the Fraser River, near Vancouver, BC, at

7:00 PM
. I would think they will be back down tomorrow. The Fraser River is the home River to many Chinook Salmon.

J-Pod
came by San Juan County Park around

8:15 am
. I was listening in to the hydrophone array and boy are they talking up a storm! Lots of distinctive J-Pod calls, and a bunch of calls that to me sound like giggling... hmmm. At
9:45 AM, the trailers are at Open Bay and the whole gang is heading slowly north-very spread out, but still vocalizing like crazy.

A quick note from Campbell River, B.C. We have had T-14 (Pender) in our area for the past couple of days that we know of. He was in Sutil channel
June 6 between Quadra and Cortes islands. Today we were lucky enough to see him in Discovery Passage, right in front of Campbell River i am enclosing a nice photo of him cruising thru Discovery Passage bucking about 6knots of ebb tide, heading for Cape Mudge I think he gets bigger every year i see him!!

9:37 pm

orcas
(including 1 calf) at 46 54.45 124 06.37, beside the Pt. Chehalis Light # 4, heading east toward Aberdeen, WA.

We started our field work with
southern residents
yesterday. We had a productive few hours with
J-pod
as they headed north in Haro Strait in the late morning/early afternoon. We primarily followed the J16 sub-group and collected samples (fish scales and bits) from at least four predation events on salmon, in about three hours of following the whales. Hoping that all days in the next couple of weeks will be as productive.
