Orca Sightings for June 30, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call today from someone who saw a pod of 5
orcas
off
Langara Island, B.C.
, including a small calf. They will be sending photos and more info. soon, which we will pass along when we receive it.
*
We so enjoyed seeing a group of
Orcas
going south in Rosario Strait close to Sinclair and Cypress this evening from

6:30pm to
7:30pm
. Being on Orcas Island we were too far to see who and get a count. However we did see lots of direction changes, spy hopping, pec and tail slapping while they slowly headed south.
