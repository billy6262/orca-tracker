Orca Sightings for June 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
T-20 & T-21
Southbound from Campbell River, at

12:00p.m.
Eagle Eye Adventures Campbell River B.C.
*
At about

8:30 am
the
J's and L's
showed up off Hannah Heights foraging actively. Lots of walls of water as some of the males rapidly changed direction on the surface. Also some breaching, tail- slapping, and spyhops, which continued as the whales traveled north. At about
8:45 am J2 and J8 lead J pod northward past LandBank. There was lots of traveling in families, with the larger males taking the offshore route. L pod followed a couple of minutes behind. Sprouters were offshore, while L41 and L57 made close passes. I saw both J42 and L109 traveling between their moms and siblings and looking healthy. I'm not sure if all L pod came in, since a lot of whales were traveling about a mile offshore.

We had the pleasure of seeing
J-Pod
swimming up near Battleship Island in the
morning
in the company of
L41 & L57
. Whales were traveling in tight groups, and it was so great and inspiring to see 8-10 whales surfacing simultaneously. A very relaxed group in no hurry as it took them an hour to get from Battleship to Stuart Island. After we left, they must have hit the gas because - When we left for our afternoon trip, J's & part of L's were already passing Mouat and making a quick beeline for Active Pass. So we got to the East entrance of Active Pass, up pops the L-11's (L41, L25, L77, and L94) heading...you guessed it-- South.

After watching
J-pod
and a number of
L-pod
members pass the Center for Whale Research very spread out, the staff headed to Snug Harbor to attempt to encounter the whales. After spotting J's and L's at Tiptop Hill heading north at

11:25 am
, the staff followed the whales into Swanson Channel. There the staff had a nice encounter with J1, J2, J14 and her kids. Halfway through the encounter the staff located L41, L77, L25 and L94 (the L11's) in a tight group at Otter Bay. Near the end of the encounter the staff observed the J's and L's in tight groups along the shoreline heading towards the West entrance of Active Pass. The staff then left the whales at

2:25 pm
and returned to Snug Harbor.
