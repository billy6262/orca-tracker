Orca Sightings for June 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Michael Carver of NOAA Fisheries, CA relayed a report from their June survey: 3 female/male pairs of
orca
off Cortel Bank, 20 miles due west of
Pt. Reyes, CA
heading south.

We found
J-Pod
at the south end of San Juan Island at

11:00 a.m
. traveling, foraging, generally going south. J-1 was in the lead, and J-16, J-42, and J-26 came along behind. The water was fairly calm and we could spend a good deal of the time sitting silently, watching the whales, or slowly paralleling them. Several boats away a
Minke
whale was spotted and we could see the fin disappear behind the boat. After several minutes we were very surprised to see the Minke whale surface in front of us! Everyone went forward in hopes of a good look and about 5 minutes later we heard a blow, and the whale surfaced at our stern quarter! Our afternoon trip (2 p.m.) took us back to the same area and we found J-Pod again, this time spread out as before, but eventually many whales headed out to Hein Bank bouy. J-1 was still cruising off to the edge of the group. We once again saw the Minke whale and then an interesting sight. We noticed a group of four whales, females and juveniles, with a very quick small form in the midst of them. It turned out we were witnessing a Dall's Porpoise zipping ahead of the J-22 and J-38. This porpoise stayed with this little group for the better part of an hour. At the end of the trip we had a nice pass by of J-30 and noticed what a tall dorsal he's growing!

Orcas
were spotted very early in the morning traveling south past the Center for Whale Research. Staff responded to the report by

7:00 a.m
. and found
J pod
spread out at the southern end of San Juan Island. The whales were moving north and were slowly gathering up into their immediate family groups. The whales were quite playful and were displaying many breaches, spyhops, and tail lobs. Staff followed the whales to Andrew's Bay where they turned around and moved south at a medium speed. The encounter ended just north of Lime Kiln Lighthouse at about

9:35 am.

Js
off the west side of San Juan Island. We collected samples from two regurgitations (from J-11) and three predation events, as well as two fecal samples. The regurgitation samples are the first we've collected from an adult killer whale (we had several from calves earlier this trip and last year), and contained a number of fish vertebrae. Quite surprising for all of us to see an adult killer whale regurgitating (actually we only saw the aftermath, not the event). Always good to get regurgitation and fecal samples, as they should give us an unbiased picture of what the whales are feeding on. Western Prince reported a Dall's porpoise traveling with several J-pod whales (J22 and J38, plus a couple others) this afternoon. We checked it out, and it appeared to be an adult male Dall's surfacing around (in front of and to the side) of these two whales - unlike some of the harbor porpoise/southern resident interactions observed in the last two years, this porpoise appeared to be interacting with the killer whales without being forced into it! We also saw a
minke
whale north of Hein Bank this afternoon.
