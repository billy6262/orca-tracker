Orca Sightings for June 1, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
was heard (loud and clear) on the Lime Kiln hydrophone from

19:45-
20:23
. Excerpts include three firsts for me: the gurgling sound of an orca surfacing; an airplane flying by; and a clattering ship sounding a
*
lot
*
like an orca echolocating.

Jim Maya called to report
J pod
, spread out and headed south between San Juan County Park and Battleship at

6:35 pm
, with J1 and two other males, likely J26 and 27 traveling together. Earlier in the day they were headed north up near the bottom of Swanson Channel, but at about
4:30 pm they turned and came back south.

Just saw the
J's
off of Whale Watch Park this afternoon.

At

10:15
this morning we found ourselves among
J Pod
, on the west side of San Juan Island. J Pod was traveling south at that time, and Ruffles was in the lead today. We were able to watch the whales from South Beach up to Eagle Point on San Juan Island. Then there was a turn around, and the whales started to move north. There were many vocalizations today! That was really fun to hear. The pod was traveling mostly in sub pod family groups. We were treated to a few breaches, some tail slaps, a spy hop, and a wonderful tail "stand." We had a nice look at J-27 while they were traveling south. The turn to the north was quite abrupt and energetic.
