Orca Sightings for June 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
As I came around the corner from Lime Kiln this morning at

8:40 am
I saw two huge breaches in front of LandBank. It was the beginning of beautiful pass by
J Pod
, swimming mostly in families and well spread out. Lots of tail-slapping and more than a few breaches. The whales were fighting an ebb tide on a glass-like surface. I could hear both the exhales and the inhales- -it was magical. Granny did a playful spyhop right in front of me. Something I hadn't seen before was a seal swimming right beside J16 and her family. It kept this up for a couple hundred yards. J26 was swimming offshore about a quarter mile from J16 and brood. Ruffles was about a quarter mile farther offshore and trailing J26. The little one (J42) was quite exuberant and orange. J pod took about 45 minutes to pass as it headed north. When the whale watch boats caught up with J pod about a half hour later, I heard the operators say that the L12's had joined J pod. I didn't see the L12's.
