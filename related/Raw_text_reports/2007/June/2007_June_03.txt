Both the Lummi and Whidbey reports were
J pod
. They were very spread out and charging south for a good part of the day.

J-pod orcas
from North of Thacher Pass south to South Lopez really aerial when first on scene, then lunch in Friday Harbor and return to Port Townsend, south of Cattle Pass, J-pod again tail slapping, fishing activity, and whales moving very fast some porpoising.

We heard reports of
J-Pod
very spread out all the way towards Smith Island. So we proceeded down that direction, but found a few whales foraging in a non-directional pattern near Minor Island. And then out of nowhere, whales began showing up in the current and were passing back and forth. The whales were pretty vocal as they began gathering from what seemed to be the four corners and began heading purposefully towards San Juan Island. Lots of surface percussives, and several breaches, including one by J30. J-1, J-2 and the J14's were traveling in a very nice tight grouping, and it was very nice to see them pass between us and Mt. Baker. On the drive home, J-Pod was still continuing up island, and one whale breached several times as a tanker passed by.

I was hiking north on West Shore Drive on Lummi Island about

7:20 am
and watched about 4-5
orcas
swimming south several hundred feet offshore (west of Lummi). They were just cruising along, surfacing and then going under for 10-15 seconds, but occasionally one would create a splash with white water showing their location.

I looked up from my kitchen table today at

1:30 pm
to see a blow about 1-2 miles offshore on the west side of Whidbey Island, near Joseph Whidbey park. From my deck I watched through binoculars as 6-7
orcas
in two different groups made their way southwest across the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the general direction of Smith Island. This is a very rare sighting--in six years of living here (and doing a lot of looking), I've seen a few grays but never any orcas. Cool!
