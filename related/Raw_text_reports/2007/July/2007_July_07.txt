I want to pass on another sighting from Annie Douglas on the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary cruise. They had
killer whales
, and forwarded some photos last night. Dave Ellifrit confirmed that they are
"offshore" killer whales
(IDs of O8 and O5). Annie's report follows. "We sighted killer whales about 3nm ahead of the ship. The animals were in about three small clusters. Initially the animals seemed to be traveling, then as we closed in they were milling under sootey shearwaters and gulls. Tail-slapping and high arch diving. A large container ship was in the immediate area, and we were towing the hydrophone array, so our first pass through the group was done at half speed, with little alteration from base course. Two subadults passed within 200m of the bow, traveling less than a body length apart.Saddle patches were distinct on all individuals, but only 1-2 had distinctly open saddle patches. The apex of the adult animals dorsal fins was rounded. There were at least 9 animals sighted, including two adult males, two yearling size animals and a number of females and juveniles.About 1 hour of acoustic recording was made from both the towed array on the MACII and from a dropped array on the RHIB. Erin Oleson reported hearing buzzes and whistles. The whales were seen in the northern end of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary at
48 19.49N and 125 08.92W.
