Orca Sightings for July 5, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a report from a boat captain off the California coast, reporting a pod of 8
orcas
just north of
Pt. Arena, CA
at about 39N 23.5W in the morning. He didn't see them, his crew did - the boat was traveling north, the whales were heading south, but then turned & swam parallel to the boat (north) for about 20 minutes, before turning again away from the boat. Didn't see any smaller whales with them, didn't know whether or not any were mature males. The whales were traveling very close to shore, tight in to the beach.

11:45 am. They also saw 2 brown pelicans off Hannah Heights from

Whales of
J, K and L pods
passed-by Lime Kiln Lighthouse at
5 a.m.
. A few of us only caught the last of the whales as they went north but we saw whales from all three pods. It was great to see Cappuccino and Raggedy as they traveled north with many others. The last to pass-by was one wide line of whales in a resting pattern. Awesome! A few hours later there were vocalizations heard over the hydrophones and after many eyes searched, whales were spotted coming in from the area of Discovery Island. Many came straight across and moved south while others traveled north past the lighthouse and then turned around and went south. Then...later Mega (L-41), Ocean Sun (L-25), Matia (L-77), Calypso (L-94), Skana (L-79), Alexis (L-12) and about 5 more came back south from the group that had passed by at 5 a.m. The rest of that group had continued north.
