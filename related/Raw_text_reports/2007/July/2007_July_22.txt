Following a sighting of
orca
on shore at Otter Point (Canadian side Juan de Fuca) in the fog,
L pod
was finally picked up 1.5-4 nm off Jordan River SW bound (
1240
) pointed for Neah Bay. Later that evening (
1815
) Westbound L pod led an eager fleet of Canadian Scarabs 4 nm off Neah Bay/Cape Flattery revealing J and K pods westbound as well.

We rceived a call from Donna at Olson's Resort in Seiku - she relayed this report from a Seiku fisherman (who later got on the phone & filled in some details): from
9 -
11:30 am
, 2 pods of
orcas
were in the Strait of Juan de Fuca off Seiku - 1 group of 9, with some calves, the other group had 11. there were about 7 males or tall fins. The whales were first heading west, then started following a salmon trawler back & forth, so kept changing directions to keep following it. There was breaching, tail slaps, the moms were pushing the calves toward the trawler. The fisherman who was out there in his boat said at one point they just shut down the motor to watch the whales for about 35 minutes, & the whales came up & started using the boat to hide under to sneak up on the fish. They could see the moms push the calves toward the fish, & the calves would attempt to take a fish but were mainly just bumping the fish - sounds like a practice session!
