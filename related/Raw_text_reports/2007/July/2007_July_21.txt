Orca Sightings for July 21, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just writing to let you know about another sighting of a porpoise calf interaction with
L pod
. We had a good number of L pod just off the Victoria waterfront on our evening trip that day. Apparently they were milling around with a porpoise for about 45 minutes before we arrived and the entire time we were watching them they were pushing the porpoise around and moving in a large circle milling. I didn't get the best Ids on the animals as I was trying to get some good video footage of them and haven't had a chance to look at it yet. It was definitely a juvenile involved in most of the activity. Although I'm pretty sure it's usually the L21s that do this behavior I think it might have been L106...not positive though until I get a good look at the video. I did get to identify L41, L57, L82, L86, L95, L77 and L94 and there were many more animals. I'm pretty sure the L9s and L2s were not accounted for. After we left we were told the whales continued this behaviour for quite a while so I can't say what the final outcome for the porpoise was.Cheers

SRKW
were speed porpoising across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, we were 2 or so miles south of Trial Island. One female orca pec slapped several times while laying on her side. Faith / L57 breached twice at two different times, maybe 400 meters away. Animals speed porpoised in groups of 2's & 3's towards Race Rocks. Flash L73, Gaia L74, Faith L57 all sighted and with others including mothers and calfs. Saw the SRKW on our way back to Victoria, a mother and calf passed us and a Tufted Puffin flew past our vessel. Another Tufted Puffin showed up by fluke in one of the orcas photos. What a day it was!

I am listening to Orcasound while typing up this whale report, and at about

3:50 pm
on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone I began hearing a few calls & clicks. Now, at

4:20 pm
they are really getting chatty!

It's a very foggy morning with no visibility, but that doesn't mean we aren't enjoying the presence of whales! Listening to the Orcasound hydrophone, I picked up faint whistles of
K-Pod
this morning around

10:00
. They got louder and louder with lots of echolocation clicks.
