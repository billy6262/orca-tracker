Orca Sightings for July 28, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were camped at Sand Point on the Olympic Park Coastal Strip on
July 27, 28 and 29. We spent a lot of time up on the "hill" at the end of the point with binoculars and a scope. We saw a Gray Whale feeding just off the kelp line southwest of the point all three days. I think it was the same individual, possibly the same individual we saw in June in the same place. On
July 28, we saw a single male
Orca
resting in the water northwest of the point. We didn't see any other Orcas in the area and we didn't see which direction he headed.

While we were out fishing in Admiralty Inlet, a
Minke
whale was traveling south, then north, mid-passage, between Point Wilson and Marrowstone Point and Whidbey Island. Cruise ships bearing down, steady as she goes. This was around

6:00
.

Received a call this morning from Jonathan Scordino, Makah Fisheries Biologist. He was out doing a humpback survey this weekend, and on Saturday they saw approx. 40
orcas
NW of Tatoosh, at 48 26.396 124 47.772, spread out over 2 miles. There were 3 - 4 males, 5 - 7 juves, & 2 calves. They were milling in about 300 - 500' of water, there were coho present, & some Chinook, but they didn't seem to be doing deep dives.

This large Grey whale with the white patch is back. His body is almost tan brown in color. He was feeding back and forth between Chito Point and the mouth of the Sekiu river, from Saturday evening (
8 pm
), through all day 7/29, with sightings from
8 am - 9 pm
. This is the same whale that was sighted here June, July '06, April '07 and this summer.
