Orca Sightings for July 10, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
L-79
just south of the lighthouse at Lime Kiln SP at night. Had a cool seat on shore, a nice break from the heat of the day, as
all 3 pods went by
. L-79 is the only one who really came close to the beach, head first into the eddy.

18, or so,
L's
just off of Washington Park's Green Point, near Anacortes. A few others demonstrated spy hops and tail slaps as they did a "drive-by" my small boat at close range. I was drifting in close to the lighthouse on Burrows Island. Soon after, I watched 5 others surface and blow simultaneously, in formation side-by-side in front of 3 tour boats in the distance. There was sporadic breaching as well. It was an "L" of a show.

10:00 PM
and
L-Pod
is singing away on the hydrophones. Lots of very loud and long vocalizations and plenty of echolocation click trains. J's and K's passed by the Center about an hour ago, 9 pm, and I'm still hearing a vocal or two from them, but nothing like the joyful noise at Lime Kiln!

(Flint Beach, South Lopez) At about

5:00
we had a great show from somewhere over 30
orcas
travelling east to west in small widely dispersed groups. We had quite a few nice breaches and plenty of tail slapping. Still, the orcas weren't lingering and moved rapidly west toward Iceberg Point. I'm fairly confident that Ruffles was one of the large males in the group.
