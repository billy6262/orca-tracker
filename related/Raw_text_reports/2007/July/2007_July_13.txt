The Lime Kiln Lighthouse hydrophone at
11.30am
had the sounds of amazing calls and clicks. It sounded like J pod to me, foraging big time! But then, I'm still learning so I'm not entirely sure. They might've been at it even before 11.30am.. but oh wow! What an awesome way to wake up!
Ly, The Netherlands, though currently living in Victoria.

We had about 10
orcas
travelling quietly east to west past Flint Beach (South Lopez) this morning. There were more spouts visible off to the west, near Iceberg Point.
