Orca Sightings for July 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
J, K and L pods
make fast trek up Swanson Channel, through Active Pass on way to Fraser River. Center for Whale Research observed them from

1:15 p.m. -
2:27 pm
.

We were headed to meet the
superpod
today, heading out of Cattle Pass. The seas were calm and glassy and we saw a few Harbor Porpoises. Suddenly, a lone one looked like it went balistic!!! We saw it leap and then jump up and do a nose dive! We couldn't believe it was a Harbor and it wasn't, it was a
Pacific White- sided Dolphin
! The little guy was not very big, closer to the size of a Dall Porpoise and without a prominent fin like other Pacifics that I've seen. We headed over for a closer look and he came to check us out. He saw alongside the boat, into the bow wake, then dropped off into the wake and flipped around in it. That was the first time in ten years that Natalie, my naturalist, had seen a Pacific and she nearly wounded a few people running around the boat.

We received a call on the Orca Network whale hotline of a pod of ~12+
orcas
passing Mayne Island at

3:45 pm
on
July 26, heading into Active Pass. They had sighted 2 orcas the day before,
July 25, as well.

At

3:40
four whales from
L Pod
were playing with what appeared to be a porpoise off of Land Bank on the west side of San Juan Island. Included are two photographs of the incident - one shows the tail of the porpoise as an orca lunges at the surface (see photo above) and the other shows the very tiny dorsal fin in front of two orcas. This is the first time this summer I had seen or heard of this behavior among the Southern Residents!

Most of the
residents
made a wonderfully close pass by the (Lime Kiln) lighthouse approx

10:00am
, headed north. Anyone in the area was treated to tail slaps, great family groupings and whales so close to shore it took your breath away. A good number then turned and headed south.

At
4 pm
, [
orcas
] went through Active Pass, heading eastward. A small group of 4 led the way; a larger group followed about 10 minutes later. Lots of activity, breaching, spy hops, tail slaps, lower body slaps.

A 20 - 30' long
gray whale
became entangled in fishing nets in the early hours of Thursday morning in Elliott Bay. At about

3:30 or 4 am
, a Muckleshoot Fisheries Chief and biologist were monitoring fishing nets when the whale was discovered. They called the Fire Dept, Fish & Wildlife & the Coast Guard but no one was available to come out to assist them. They worked for 30 minutes to cut the whale free, and it swam off, with some of the fishing gear still attached. It is unknown whether or not the whale was able to free itself from the remaining gear.
