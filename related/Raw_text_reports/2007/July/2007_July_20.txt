Orca Sightings for July 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
After recieving a report of a Superpod gathering (
J, K and L pods
) offshore of the Victoria waterfront Center for Whale Research staff headed out in R/V Orca. Upon arrival on scene at

12:22 p.m
, staff observed numerous groups of whales socializing. First a large group of males were encountered, later the older females were seen traveling together. They socialized off the Victoria waterfront ­ in the fog ­ for some time, before returning to the west side of San Juan Island. Encounter ended at
3:20 p.m.

[
Latest total count of Southern Resident pods from the Center for Whale Research is 86
], animals had reached San Juan Island and were northbound at Pile Point from Salmon Bank. As we stayed pretty much in one spot, the animals traveled fairly close to the shoreline. Various groups of animals passed, along the way exhibiting a variety of behaviors such as; finning (speed hunting below the surface) 2 distant breaches, some aerial scanning (animals laying on their side looking above the surface), tail flukes, and upside down orcas, and even some mating behavior. If you look closely at the photos, you will see some interesting orca positions. Including one male who I think is Mike / J26 exposed out of the water (see photo above) . He was engaging with other individuals who are also in interesting positions. There seemed to be some playful behavior also between Ruffles / J1 and another orca. Some rubbing and investigative behaviors were sighted through the lens. All the animals seemed to be fairly social with one another on their travels. There was a large group passing through spread apart in smaller groups and were probably about 200 meters off of our stern the whole time.
