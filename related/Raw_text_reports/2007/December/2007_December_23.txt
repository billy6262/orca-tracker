Orca Sightings for December 23, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson of NOAA FIsheries & other researchers were out with the orcas in Puget Sound, & confirmed that it is
K pod
that has been swimming around the last few days. They caught up with them off West Pt, near Seattle at

11:55 am
, still heading north, & left them off the Edmonds Ferry dock at
3 pm
. They were able to collect several fecal & fish scale samples.

Matt Purcell called to report seeing a pod of
orcas
(K pod) from Discovery Park in West Seattle at

12:30 pm
. They were about 400 meters out, heading N/NE. He saw a group of 5 orcas, including a female with a calf and a larger male.
*
We just spotted some
orca
off Arroyo Beach at

9:45 am
, moving north toward Brace point and Fauntleroy at a quick pace. There seemed to be two different small groups. They were too far away to tell how many or to see clear markings. Thanks
Jennifer, Arroyo Beach
