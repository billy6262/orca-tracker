Orca Sightings for December 2, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call today from John Pomerenk reporting a
gray
whale near Bremerton this afternoon. He watched it for 2 hrs. from about
noon - 2 pm
. It was 20' from shore in 10 - 15' deep water, south of the Manette Bridge, between the bridge & ferry terminal. It was just foraging with no particular direction of travel.
