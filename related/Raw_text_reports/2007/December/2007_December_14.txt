Orca Sightings for December 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
10am-11am
saw as many as 4
orca
breaching at the same time, one more barely visible under the water. This was my first sighting so I don't know who they were. Just off Browns Point, they swam west toward Point Defiance, then 15-20 minutes later swam back and circled. Then saw what I think was one sea lion and two harbor seals cruise by the shore looking for refuge. The orca were last seen heading north between Dash Point and Maury Island.

The Orca Network hotline received a report of ~20
orcas
in Colvos Passage, near the Shingle Mill Creek area of Vashon Isalnd, heading north toward Southworth at

2:05 pm
.

Catherine Rice called the Orca Network hotline at

12:50 pm
, reporting 8+
orcas
off the west side of Vashon Island. They were watching from Prospect Pt, near Olalla on the Kitsap Peninsula.
*
At least 12
Orcas
, spread throughout about a 1 mile diameter from the following coords: 47.44.27.80N, 122.24.57.64W (between N. Bainbridge Island & Meadow Pt N. of Seattle), very slowly northbound. I watched them from about
1245-1330
. Just seemed to be hanging out. Some tail- slapping and fin-waving. Definitely 1 very large male to the far east side of the group. Possibly other smaller ones, not sure.

From our beach house on Vashon's west side, about 1/2 mile south of Point Vashon: We saw two
orcas
at about

2:15 pm
. At first, they were staying in the same spot, in the middle of Colvos passage, going under and coming back up in roughly the same location. This continued for maybe five minutes. Then they began to move north fairly quickly, moving towards Blake Island. We last saw them surface just astern of the Tillikum ferry, on its crossing towards Southworth. It looked like the orcas were heading towards the east, out into the main part of the Sound, but we couldn't be sure of that. One whale had a very thin pointed fin, and seemed smaller than the other.
