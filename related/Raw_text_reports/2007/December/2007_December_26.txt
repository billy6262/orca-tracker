Orca Sightings for December 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries NWSC reported they found the pod of
orcas
off Dolphin Pt, NE Vashon Island and followed them south, leaving them spread out NW of Brown's Pt, heading into Dalco Passage. They confirmed it was
K pod
, & were able to get several fecal & scale samples. There were a lot of pec & tail slaps, & K21 & K40 were speed-swimming way ahead of the pod in the
afternoon
.

Amy Carey found the pod of
orcas
(K's) between Vashon Island & Alki Pt. at

11:05 am
, spread out & milling mid-channel. By
11:30 they were just north of the Vashon ferry lanes, coming down the east side of Vashon. At
12:55 pm they made a nice pass by Dilworth, still heading south, close to shore - 1 was within 20' of the shoreline! They were still spread out, with a few breaches. At
2:10 pm the whales headed around Pt. Robinson, with LOTS of breaching, swimming on their backs & showing their bellies, & giving a great show to a crowd of nearly 100 people on the shoreline. By

3:20 pm
they were off Gold Beach, still heading south & spread out.

I rushed out at
10:30 am and managed to see one
orca
heading south off Alki Point at

10:40
, closer to the Bremerton side.

My husband and I saw just one
Orca
(could not tell if it was traveling with its pod) from our home in Rolling Bay, on Bainbridge Island. The Orca was heading South. We only saw the dorsal fin 3 times in a matter of 5 mintues. This was at

9:00am
