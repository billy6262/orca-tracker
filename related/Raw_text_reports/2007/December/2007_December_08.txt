Orca Sightings for December 8, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pam Gray called the Orca Network hotline to report seeing one, maybe two, orcas under the Hood Canal bridge, at 3 pm. She said they scattered a flock of ducks, like they might have caught one.
