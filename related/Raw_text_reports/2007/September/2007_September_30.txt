Orca Sightings for September 30, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jason of the Victoria Clipper called to report a pod of
orcas
off Pt. No Point, Kitsap Peninsula, heading south at
7 pm
- at least a dozen orcas, several breaches observed.
*
We had just arrived at a rental house on west Whidbey, at N. Bush Pt, & were preparing for a party, when Bob Sines looked out the window & saw
orcas
at about

4:45 pm
! We were all excited, grabbed binoculars & the scope, & watched as they passed by, fairly close to the Whidbey side, heading south. Howie saw J1 & ID'd a few other J pod whales - how cool they came to join our party - and even more fun that they returned this morning - see above report!

The Orca Network hotline received a call this morning at

11:09 am
, from Wayne Blicha reporting a pod of 4
orcas
, no males, 14 nautical miles NW of
Morro Bay, CA
, between Santa Barbara & Monterey, at 35 26.55 N 121 8.75 W. They were seeing bits of whatever the whales were feeding on come to the surface, & the orcas were throwing them around - looked like marine mammal bits not fish....sounds like a pod of
Transients
.
