I am a novice at this, but this
afternoon
, west of Salt Creek Park and very close to shore, I spotted an
Orca
spouting and playing in the shallow water. It only "rolled" once, but I could see a pretty tall dorsal fin and a long black back. It was very exciting. I only saw the one animal, and it didn't stay up long at all. If there was any specific movement that the whale was making, it would seem to have been toward the east.Hope this is helpful!
