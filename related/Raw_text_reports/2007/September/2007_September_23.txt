Orca Sightings for September 23, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today I went out at
10am
. Same
K's and L's
were seen off Hanna Heights travelling north. Then we got word of
J's and L2's
coming back down and all pods met up north of Kellet Bluff off Henry Island forming Superpod!! There were a whole bunch of tail slapping, some breaches, spyhops. Then on the
1.30pm
trip we met up with the same whales again at Andrews Bay. Still a few breaches but mostly just slowly moving south. They were very spread out in small groups. L41, Mega passed by several times and also L pod's newest member L110 came over and took a peek at us alongside it's mom. And just before leaving.. K21, Cappuchino cruised by.

Capt. Jim Maya tells us that
J's and the L2's
(see
CWR ID Guide
, bottom page, for the L2's) came down Boundary Pass and Haro Strait and met up with K's and the rest of L's just off the west side of Henry Island (west of San Juan Is.) just after noon. They played for about an hour in roughly the same place under beautiful September skies. Then they all turned south along San Juan Island and by 4 PM they were spread out foraging off Lime Kiln Lighthouse.

Turn on your hydrophone to OrcaSound!
K's
are singing up a storm as they go by heading North. Heard
J's
were up near Boundary coming down---sounds like we may have a super pod in the making! Will let you know more later today. I LOVE September whales!
