Two
humpbacks
feeding outside the kelp bed - going back and forth, from west to east to west to east, out of my range of vision, continually
during the last four days - 8/28- 9/1
. At one point Friday afternoon (8/31) , there were two
Grays
on the west of Chito Point, and two Humpbacks in the feeding spot on the east, for hours at a time. When I've been gone, or working, guests have continued to report seeing whales, with sightings at all times of the day, during the last two weeks, however, could not identify if they were Grays or Humpbacks.

I was trolling for salmon at the southwest corner of the "Rock Pile" about 8 miles off shore (out of Lapush due west) at about

9:40 a.m.
we noticed some small fins comming out of the water, about 20 yards to starboard of our boat. We idled down to about 1 knot to maintain steering. We counted the fins and we counted 4 or 5, then they started came out of the water (sometimes 2 or 3 at a time. whole body flops) and they were
young orca whales
(seemed real young to me). We pulled up the fishing gear and stopped the boat. They got within about 10 yards of my boat still jumping and disappearing and more jumping. What we didn't see was the adults coming from Port until
one "gigantic Male"
came out of the water about 15 yards from the boat. That got our attention! We counted 9 to 11 fins in the adult pod, however, we could have counted some twice or missed some too. The adults were about 50 yards from their kid's, both the adults and kid's were comming out of the water and then diving back down, at one time the kid's were lined up in formation chasing something towards our boat, then they dove down under the boat and came up about 50 yards to port. An adult whale (fin had to be over 6 plus feet in height, I'm 6' 1" and it was taller than me) came right up the port side of our boat (within spitting distance) cut in front of it and seemed to have moved us a little bit. It was like he/she was scratching their back. They ate and played for about 40 minutes. The adult group headed west and got a couple hundred yards from the kid's. The kid's were still close to us, and the adults must have made a call becuse the kid's took off in a hurry to catch up with them. It was all over by
10:30 a.m. and they were out of sight in a hurry. Needless to say, that salmon fishing got real slow in that spot. I don't know what pod it was. They all looked healthy, no scars or dings. The kids were different sizes, one was the runt (considerably smaller then the others). I can't say how many males, except one for sure (we got a close up of him). I didn't get any pictures. This was my first time fishing this area. It was a once in a lifetime experience, that I will never forget. [update] We did not see any seals, porpoises, or sea lions out on the "Rock Pile" off LaPush, WA. I am positive the young whales were orca's and not porpoises. They were swimming in front of the adult pod. I did not see any of them eating, but we were fishing for salmon and "marking" them on the sonar about 20 to 35 feet deep. When the orcas showed up the sonar went crazy marking fish. The fish showed up as big ball on the sonar screen. The adult group was circling as if they were rounding up salmon, and while you could see 3 big fins circling, one would come out of the water (whole body and smiling) in the middle of the circle, the 3 fins you could see would disappear for just a few minutes and then reappear circling. I don't know if it was the same three fins or different ones. The younger group was doing the same thing about 20 yards to the north, except there was only four of them.

Members of
J-Pod
hanging out at Eagle Point. As we came towards Eagle Point, J27 Blackberry made his way over to us, and every time we tried to back out of his way, he would adjust his course like a homing pigeon and slowly passed our stern. We were also able to ID J26 Mike, J28 Polaris, J16 Slick, J1 Ruffles, and what appeared to be the J22 clan (Oreo, Doublestuff, and Cookie).

Orcas
here on the west side of San Juan Island late
afternoon
. I heard blowing and smacking the water sounds and then watched for about 30 min. and they cruised by spread out. There were lots of whale watch boats and private boats keeping a respectful distance off shore with motors shut down drifting. The whales were headed north towards the Lighthouse. Big fins and smaller ones, but I don't know what pod. They must have gone by Limekiln Lighthouse about 5 PM.
