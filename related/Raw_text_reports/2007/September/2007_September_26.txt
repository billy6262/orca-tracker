Orca Sightings for September 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We live in Port Angeles and have been watching a small
gray
about 23' in the Salt Creek area here... he or she is beautiful and feeding well as much as we can see. We saw him about 4 days ago and before that about a week as well as the day after the killing in Neah Bay. Thanks

J's, K's and L's
come in from the ocean actively catching salmon. Staff of the Center for Whale Research and the University of Washington continued fecal sampling, with members of K and L- pod. The whales were first reported heading east near Race Rocks, British Columbia. The whales were encountered as they crossed Haro Strait approaching the west side of San Juan Island at

2:36 p.m
. Several hours were spent with the whales as they slowly foraged north through Haro Strait. Several salmon kills were observed, numerous scales were sampled, and two poops were collected during the encounter. The encounter ended at
6:34 p.m. as members of J, K and some members of L-pod continued northward towards the Fraser River.

Tracy from Beam Reach called this
morning
to report a
superpod
(J, K & L pods) off Lime Kiln, San Juan Island.

The [
orcas
] came in from the west and hit the west side of the island at about

2:30 pm
. Initially, some went north and some went south.
Js and Ks
went north first, although J27 went north with some L pod whales. At this point the whales were spread from Eagle to above Andrews Bay, mostly traveling and foraging in small groups. Then lots of L pod whales decided to go north also. There were some surface vocals (my favorite) from L pod whales at Land Bank. At around

4:45 pm
, the last group that I saw to go north was a great L pod nursery group It had lots of calves and juveniles. As I watched, the nursery group kept changing in size from what appeared to be about 5 to 6 whales up to more than 15 at some surfacings, and then smaller groups again. The two youngest calves, L109 and L110 appeared to be joined by a calf from last year. The calves were quite energetic, with lots of tail slapping, porpoising and some breaching, and lots of rolling over each other. As the group approached Lime Kiln going north, the whales turned in unison on the surface, headed south still on the surface, and broke into smaller groups of about 5 or more whales. Then at least seven to eight of the whales appeared to be logging on the surface headed south, in two separate groups. Suddenly two juveniles began porpoising south. The rest of the whales continued to log on the surface for about a minute or two, still pointed south. Then they turned north and continued north. I thought this was unusual, to leave the juveniles by themselves, but later learned that a group of L pod whales had remained south. There must have been some strong communication going on between the whales at Eagle and those at Lime Kiln. Great September whales.
