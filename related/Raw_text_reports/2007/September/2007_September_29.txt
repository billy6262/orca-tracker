Orca Sightings for September 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
The pod of
orcas
reported between Port Townsend & Whidbey Island on Saturday have been confirmed Transients by the Center for Whale Reserach, based on photos taken by Orca Network.

While I can't say anything with any certainty, the last picture of the bull has a very T44 look about him. That eyepatch makes me "all but positive" that they are transients.

I had a call that
residents
were spotted up north at the coal docks coming down at
4 pm
. Maybe only part of them went west earlier today????

The Orca Network hotline received a call from Brad West at

10:30 am
, reporting a pod of
orcas
off North Beach, just N of the Port Townsend Fairgrounds. They were in the kelp beds, heading into Admiralty Inlet. He saw 1 male, and a female with a calf, a total of at least 6 orcas.

At

10:43 am
, the Orca Network hotline received a call from Bernard Pranger of Port Townsend, reporting the pod of
orcas
, off North Beach, NW of Pt. Townsend - he also saw 1 male, and estimated possibly 9 whales total, heading into Admiralty Inlet.
*
We went to Ft. Casey State Park to find the
orcas
, and at about

11:45 am
saw them, still NW of Pt. Wilson. They remained in that general area until
12:20 pm, sometimes in two groups, then grouping into 1 group, with a total of 7 orcas (1 male, 5 females & 1 calf). At
12:20 pm, they headed SE past the Port Townsend Marine Science Center, mid-channel, at a pretty fast pace. At
12:55 pm they were between Keystone & Ft. Flagler State Park, still heading SE.
