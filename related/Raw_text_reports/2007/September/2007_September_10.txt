============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern residents

Robin Baird and Brad Hanson
*
Jim Maya called at

6:35 pm
to report
J, K & most of L pods
7 miles due north of Patos Island, possibly getting ready to head down toward Lummi Island & Rosario Strait. He reported lots of socializing and recreational sexual activity amongst a beautiful sunset.
*
At approximately

12:15
there were numerous
orcas
passing Point Roberts heading towards East Point. Probably Js and Ks and maybe Ls. They were moving slowly and doing some foraging. Very spread out for complete IDs.

We had
J's, K's, and most of the L's
coming down from the Fraser River Buffet, and we caught up with them just east of Point Roberts. For nearly an hour, we were shut down and just drifting as whales came by in groups of 3-4. As they passed by, the whales vocalized loudly and often. It was not quiet underwater the entire time we were on scene. First by was K7 Lummi, followed by K38 and K21 Cappucino and K40 Raggedy. We could get an idea of who was coming by just by listening to the hydrophone---first were kitten calls of K's, then the bird-like calls of L's. Sure enough, along came L57 Faith, and others.
