Orca Sightings for September 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We heard reports of
Transients
spotted well west of Race Rocks coming eastbound, and were sorely tempted to head over there. Then we got several calls from another boat saying he had several
minke
whales near Middle Bank and Dall's as well. We had not one or two, but
5 minke whales
actively feeding near Middle Bank. It was so still and calm, we were able to shut down completely and just listen to the minke's as they attacked baitball after baitball. The birds would school the fish, and make a racket doing it. Then you'd see several minke's surface heading for the baitball. Then WHAM--the birds would go flying into the air and the minke got a huge mouthful of baitfish. This is the best minke encounter I've ever had, and several times we saw minke's swimming high speed on their sides through the fish--it was so cool. Dozens of Dalls Porpoise were also feeding in the area, and we saw a new baby hybrid calf! We ended our trip at Whale Rocks, where we watched 49 Steller Sea lions settling down for the evening.
