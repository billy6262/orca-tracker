Orca Sightings for September 21, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the
9am
trip with POW we got a report of
orcas
west of San Juan Island. We caught up with
J's and L2's
off Hannah Heights. It was great seeing the two brothers L78, Gaia and L88, Wavewalker travelling together. J's were once again extremely vocal, but this time I actually got to see them too! Then on the
12.15pm
OM trip we headed out straight to San Juan. This time there were some breaches and cartwheels while the whales were southbound. On our way back I got to see a
minke
I missed in the morning. There were 2-3 of them at Hein Bank. Then further west we spotted some Dall's Porpoises. Back home I turned on the hydrophone and between
7.45pm and 9.30pm
the whales were still highly vocal switching on and off between OrcaSound and Lime Kiln.
happy Ly.

Jeff Hogan called in with logs of reports.
J's and L2's
headed north along San Juan at

8:30 AM
, turned south about
noon
, and back north by

6:00 PM.

J's
were around making quite the racket I hear on the hydrophones. Rumor that they went north.
