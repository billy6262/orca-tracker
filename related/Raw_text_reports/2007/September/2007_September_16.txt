Just after
12:00, south of Hannah Heights -- [
orcas
] were right there! When we got out on the water, we had two groupings of whales, one near the False Bay area, and the second group out near Salmon Bank. But before we could get out there, we had a really nice viewing of a Puffin at the bottom of San Juan Channel. Followed shortly thereafter by a loon. In the still water near Salmon Bank marker, we shut down to watch the whales that were passing about 200 yards to our stern. Just a few whales here and there at the start. We were hearing
J-Pod & L-Pod
calls as they echoed off of the island and back towards us. Soon we noticed that whales were slowly gathering in one spot. Soon our dribs and drabs became 8, then over a dozen whales. They began logging on the surface for minutes at a time. Resting behavior was the appearance on the surface, but the hydrophone told another story as the vocalizations became louder and louder. Soon we were also hearing vocalizations above the surface!!! Then a lot of rolling around, pushing, and spyhopping. One whale made a "raspberry" sound above surface followed by what sounded like "la la la la la" (at least to me), and another huge spyhop. Then the whales turned south and we saw L67 Splash with a very attentive J27 Blackberry slowly closing in on her. She would log at the surface and as he came close, she would make a squeal above surface and then dive down. L88 Wavewalker was also getting into the "action" with an unidentified female. The best part of the whole experience---all the action was happening in one location with all the boats being very respectful and keeping their distances.

UPDATE: The unidentified female I stated in my report is now known---I just looked at my pictures and noticed the "beauty marks" in the eye patches and the bump on the saddle patch. None other than one of my favorites--J22 OREO!
