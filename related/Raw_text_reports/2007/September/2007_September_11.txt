Orca Sightings for September 11, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
orca
sighting was on the RV Wecoma at

18:06
GMT as the ship was conducting a magnetics and multibeam survey off the coast of Oregon. The ship at the time was about an hour and a half to 2 hour steam from
Newport, OR
(close to the coast, northwest of port). Two individuals were sighted traveling at a moderate pace off the port bow. The two orcas surfaced almost synchronously at least three to four times and swam generally at a heading of 285 deg relative to the ship as the vessel passed. The CPA of the animals was approximately 250-300 meters. Pacific white sided dolphins, Dall's porpoise, and Humpback whales were also sighted in the area during the same day.

Ls
off False Bay in the early
evening
, we had at least six and possibly seven sightings of
minkes
- 1 near Salmon Bank, 2-3 off Hein Bank, 1 north of Port Angeles, 1 east of Protection Island (a very small individual), and 1 NW of Protection Island. We were able to obtain ID photos of at least three of these that we'll be passing on to the minke whale project.

At Lime Kiln Lighthouse from

5:30-
6:45 PM
we had members from
all three pods
head north, then turn and go back south close to shore. There were several very unique observations, including a whale spyhopping with its mouth open and "gargling" water and a beautiful mother-calf double breach (probably Samish J14 and Suttles J4). Some other individuals spotted include K21 with K40; L7, L53, and L57 with the J2s; the K12 family group being quite playful and rolling around on the surface; and pretty much all of J-Pod.

Started with an unexpected sighting of whales around

8:30 AM
by a friend of mine of a "lot of whales" near Sucia & Patos. Then word came around at
11:30 AM that
all three pods
were heading west past Race Rocks. I looked out the window and noticed the tide was really down, so that could only mean a strong flood. I kept telling people, "the whales are going to turn around, trust me." And wouldn't you know it, they did! We encountered the whales off the Victoria waterfront, with whales spread out in many smaller groups. We moved east away from the other boats and just waited to see if the whales would continue towards San Juan. And we had a lovely viewing of K-Pod: K7 Lummi, K11 Georgia, K37 Rainshadow, K21 Cappucino, K26 Lobo, K40 Raggedy were all swimming in a very nice group. The rest of the K's were just behind them, and J's and L's were in the rear. We watched the whales move right along the current rips seeking out salmon, and were befuddled for a moment by a larger male orca that showed up behind us. Why it was none other than L87 Onyx. Man is he growing up into a big whale! Lots of rolling around in the currents, some spyhopping, but alas no vocals. But it was good that they returned after only a few hours away instead of leaving for days and days. Last I heard, L's were still on the south end of San Juan and J's & K's were rumored to be heading north.
