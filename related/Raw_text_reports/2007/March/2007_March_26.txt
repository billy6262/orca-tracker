Orca Sightings for March 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received this report forwarded on through several people, so will print some of it with a reminder to please be respectful of the whales! This incident was observed on Monday
evening
off North Bluff road, just north of Greenbank Farm. It was low tide, and the the water there is shallow. A
grey whale
was spouting, seemingly rather close to shore (the whales do come in very close to shore here to feed - sb) . A white skiff with 2 men was slowly edging up towards the whale, it appeared that they were slowly driving the whale into shallow water. The whale kept coming up and breaching, and was coming nearer the beach each time. Whenever the whale breached, the men in the skiff edged closer, at an angle towards the beach, with the whale a few hundred yards in front of them. (I am trying to get clarification if they mean "surfacing" or "breaching"-sb). They then drifted out towards the deeper water (heading south towards Holmes Harbor)before putting the motor back down heading south. My friend says the skiff was white, about 10 feet long, with a large black outboard. The name of the skiff was 2 words, painted in black, but unfortunately they couldn't see the exact lettering.

One
gray whale
about 60 yards off the beach at the northern boundary of Fort Ward St. Park on the west side of Bainbridge Island, traveling south

5:15pm
. It was swimming parallel to the beach. It came up to the surface, made what sounded a little like a coughing sound as it took in air, and then slowly disappeared back under the water.

Our liveaboard friends in the Port Ludlow marina heard a big splash behind their boat midday, and stopped what they were doing to look. It turned out to be a
gray whale
which must have been lost because they rarely come in Ludlow Bay maybe once every 5 years. Our mud must not contain as many tasty copepods as the mud between Whidbey and Camano. This gray whale actually went all the way into Ludlow Bay, and into the very shallow water between the first two docks. Lori & T.J.'s slip is the closest to shore, and they think the big splash was the whale realizing it needed to turn around or risk going aground, and the space between those two docks is pretty narrow so the whale would have needed to make a tight turn. Since Lori was a naturalist in Kona, I'm confident that they know how to identify whales and how to be respectful in their presence. Everyone had a great afternoon watching this gray whale. After nearly visiting the Harbormaster, the whale spent some time just outside the marina. So there was great viewing from the end of "A" dock, and then when the whale realized s/he had the completely wrong bay and headed out, Lori & T.J., Ann & Don, and another couple hopped in dinghys and trailed it from a respectable distance. By late afternoon, the gray whale had headed north; moving out of Ludlow Bay along the west side of the shore, east past Colvos rocks, and the last time anyone saw it, it was headed NE in the direction of Whidbey.

I watched 2
grays
feeding just off shore near Sandy Point (Saratoga Psg. south of langley). One of them appeared to be rather small.

Have just seen a
gray
moving slowly northward about ½ mile offshore from Camano opposite Penn Cove entry. Moving very slowly, parallel to Camano shoreline. It doesn’t seem to be in any hurry at all.
