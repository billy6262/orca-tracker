Spotted two
grey whales
off of east point at about

3:45pm
. One was "patch" with a white spot just aft of the dorsal fin. They were heading east about 300 yards off the beach.
Stan Deal, Whidbey Island
*
At

2:30 p.m
. 2
grey whales
were heading west from just north of Onamac Point, west Camano Island. We couldn't see where they went from there, as they must have moved closer to shore.
Jan Nicholson, Camano Island

About

11:30 AM
, a lone
Gray
south of Mabana, feeding deep and moving to the North .
Barbara Brock, Camano Island

Cheryl Creelman called at

12:55 pm
to report at least 3
gray whales
in Port Washington Narrows close to the west side of the Warren Ave. Bridge in Bremerton. Then sent this email: Well our whales are still out here at Port Washington Narrows -

7:15 PM
. They have been out here all day. I would guess they have found a feeding hole. They are grey with splotchy spots. The baby is a very light gray. They have been staying pretty much in this same spot all day.

This morning, my father and I spotted what we assumed was a
gray whale
. We saw only a portion of it as it came up, this happened twice within a five minute time period. This was at Point-No-Point lighthouse between

6:30-
6:45 am
.
Rosemary and Walter Meeker

Joan Peter called in a report of a very large
gray whale
close to their beach at Shorewoods, across from Hood Head & just north of the Hood Canal Bridge north of Port Gamble Bay. It circled north & south, back & forth for two hours, which sounds like feeding behavior.

Robert Hewett called to report a
gray whale
between the Warren Ave. bridge & Lion's Park (bet. Lion's park & the yacht club) in Bremerton, at
noon
. The whale was heading south, then turned north.
