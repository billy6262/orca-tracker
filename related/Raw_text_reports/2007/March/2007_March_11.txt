Orca Sightings for March 11, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jim Maya called at
1 pm
to report a group of 5
Transient
orcas in Baynes Channel, west of Victoria. Mark Malleson was on his way out to get ID's. Later reports (see report below) have ID's of this group as the T2's & T14, the same orcas that have been in that area the past few days.

At noon Captain Jim Maya aboard the Peregrine contacted the Center For Whale Research to report a group of
transients
south of Discovery Island. Mark Malleson and Maya caught up with the whales in the vicinity of Chatham and Great Chain Islands. They identified five whales: the T2s and T14. Staff from the Center For Whale Research went out in R/V Starlet to catch up with the group, but by the time they reached the Victoria waterfront the transients were already quite far south of Victoria heading towards Port Angeles. Just as R/V Starlet was about to arrive on scene, Malleson reported there was another group of whales inbound just off Victoria. Shortly thereafter Center staff spotted whales spread out near the Victor Hotel bouy and positively identified the whales as
J pod
. The whales were non-directional and spread out. Due to weather and the dispersed nature of the whales, the staff aboard R/V Starlet were only able to identify the following individuals: J1, J2, J8, J11, J19, J27, J31, J32, J33, J39 and J41. As R/V Starlet departed, J pod was last seen heading southwest towards Race Rocks.
