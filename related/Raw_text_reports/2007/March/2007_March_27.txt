============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Jason Anderson reporting a
gray whale
off the Seattle Waterfront, next to the Seattle Aquarium, about 50' from shore.

One possibly two
grays
on the west side of Camano off of Elger Bay, sounding and breaching.....making big splashes. What a show.

Dodie on Camano

5:40 PM
I caught sight of the first
gray whale
spouts from our house this year. The whale was mid channel toward Langley, and slowly worked its way toward the Camano side and then gradually north. It looked like a lot of feeding behavior, staying around the same area for some time.
