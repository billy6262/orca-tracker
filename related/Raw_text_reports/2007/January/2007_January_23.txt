Orca Sightings for January 23, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
"(CBC) Likely lost and alone after taking a wrong turn, a wayward
grey
whale has been sighted swimming up the Fraser River early Tuesday
morning
, at a time when most of its compadres are migrating south for the mating season. Whale watchers have reportedly dubbed the mammal, dotted with its characteristic grey-white marks, "Moby." But Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard cautioned that although the animal may not be under threat of being hunted anytime soon, prolonged exposure to the river water could be a danger".
