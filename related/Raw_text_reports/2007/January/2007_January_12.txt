Orca Sightings for January 12, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
There was an
Orca
in our little inlet. I was too excited to think to id the dorsal for sex and didn't see the markings long enough. It was traveling slowly towards the sound. Very close to the Point Hudson Marina side of the inlet. Close enough that I could just hear it's blow. It spy hopped for me.
