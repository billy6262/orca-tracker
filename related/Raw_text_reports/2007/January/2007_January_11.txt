We received a call from a crabber reporting seeing a pod of 8 - 10
orcas
, including 1 male & at least 1 calf half-way between
Coos Bay & Winchester Bay OR
, in 58 fathoms of water, about 1 & a half weeks ago (Jan. 5 or 6-ish). he said they were playing & breaching, no real direction of travel. He also gave a very belated report of a pod of 8 - 10 orcas north of Coos Bay in
July 2002, in 110 fathoms of water, heading north.
