Orca Sightings for May 10, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark from the Victoria Clipper called to report 3 female or juvenile
orcas
off the #4 buoy near Pt. Wilson, west of Port Townsend, outbound at

7:14 pm
.
*
We received a call from Marcy of Newport Tradewinds, relaying a report from Capt. Gerald Schaefer of a pod of
orcas
heading toward Yaquinna Bay, near
Newport OR
at

7:25 am
. I talked to the Capt, & he said there were 2 adults & 1 calf, they came up from the south & were at the tip of the jetty, looking like they were going to head into the harbor, but Marcy never saw them in the harbor, so not sure where they went.
From the size of the pod, & the location, I am guessing these are Transients but that is not confirmed - sb.
