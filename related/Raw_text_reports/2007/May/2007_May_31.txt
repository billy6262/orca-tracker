Orca Sightings for May 31, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Js
6mi north of Alden Bank this afternoon. Moving at 5kt in the direction of Rosario Strait, skillfully working the tideline for a boost. Some sporadic foraging behaviour; one group took a rapid charge into a sizeable bait ball, which I can only assume had attracted a few salmon. Incredibly acrobatic, double and triple breaches in rapid succession -- J1 among them! One of our juveniles has also proven to be very acrobatic; I could not tell if this was our newborn, but I'm curious if it wasn't J41 who (if I remember correctly) was quite a jumper last summer. It is interesting to me that the whales are almost completely silent while in the frenzy of breaching; one call did come through (wish I'd recorded it) that I have never heard in any other setting.

The word was
J-Pod
was coming south from Point Roberts. We were in hopes they would continue south and that our long trip would not end in just a glimpse of whales. An hour later,~
1 pm
, traveling through smooth water with sunny skies above, we came across J Pod, spotting J-1, Ruffles first. We had a pleasant 20 - 30 minutes watching two family groups traveling south toward Rosario Strait, with occasional foraging behavior. Polaris, J-28, gave us a quick swim by. Then, something seemed to change and the first whale executed three cycle breaches. Great! But, wait, there's more. It seemed to turn into the Great Breach-O-Rama Day....with whales breaching fully out of the water multiple times each. In the distance the little ones threw themselves clear of the water as well. And it didn't stop! It was wonderful to see such a high level of activity, both speed swimming, porpoise diving, tail slaps, spy hops, and yes, lots and lots of breaching.

What looks to be
J pod
(from the shoreline) heading south off Lummi Island right around
6 p.m
. VERY spread out - the leaders are already rounding the corner at Village Pt. (or Stinky Pt. as some of us islanders call it due to the nasty prevailing SW winter winds!) while I could still see spouts out towards Alden Bank buoy! I did see one teeny weeny baby-type breach out there in the distance! Only 2 Canadian hi-speed commercial boats out there....
