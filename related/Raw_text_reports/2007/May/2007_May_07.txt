J-pod was first reported

Entry 2:
10:40 a.m. The pod traveled eastbound just offshore of Victoria, then across Haro Strait towards the west side of San Juan Island. Center for Whale Research staff encountered J-pod heading southbound near the coastline of Eagle Point. The whales were spread out in several small groups foraging. All members of J-pod were present, including the new calf. Center staff maintained detailed observations of the calf and her extended family, observing the matrilineal group engaged in an extended period of playful behavior. The calf looked healthy and was receiving a lot of attention from the other members of the pod. Center for Whale Research staff observed the whales spread out in several small groups foraging along the southern shore of San Juan Island before the whales tightened up and entered San Juan Channel. The whales then traveled northbound through San Juan Channel along the western shore of Lopez Island, before heading northwest into Upright Channel. Staff of the Center for Whale Research left the whales as they passed Foster Point (Orcas Island) heading towards Obstruction Pass.

J-Pod
decided that it was time to head back towards San Juan Island. As we sat near Discovery Island, the whales, which at one point appeared to be heading up Banes Channel, decided instead to loop around the south end of Discovery. They made the corner in groups of 3-4, and one of the first groups past was none other than the much- anticipated J-16 and newbie J-42. It was really incredible to see them just passing along the island in a slow, easy pace. Most of the groups, as they approached the lighthouse on Discovery, would have at least one member spyhop (sometimes multiple spyhops), leading one to wonder if they were using the man- made structure to get their bearings. J14 Samish was observed with J40 Suttles, and her offspring was tucked in right next to mom riding in her slipstream. Lots of percussives and breaches as the whales made their way towards False Bay.

~ 8 pm
, two
gray whales
in Saratoga Passage behind The Dog House in Langley disappearing under the surface for periods of time, then coming up to blow. Slowly traveling east to west... all about 400 ft off shore. Did not seem to be feeding, but hard to tell as those waters are deep.

Earlier today, around
11am
, I was scanning the waters south of the Langley small boat harbor and low and behold there was one lone
gray whale
, it appeared to be feeding in close to shore. I watched for 30 mins. or so as the whale fed and finally headed east across Saratoga Passage toward the mid- channel.
