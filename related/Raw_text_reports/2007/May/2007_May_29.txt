Orca Sightings for May 29, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Briony Penn was hiking up the Maxwell mountain on Salt Spring Island Tuesday
evening
and saw
ORCA
in Sansum Narrows going SOUTH. She thought there might be about 5 - 6 whales. She said there was one boat following them, and there appeared to be a different whale with no dorsal fins nearby (GREY WHALE?).Do you have any idea who this could have been?
Tamar Grigg, Salt Spring Island
This was likely Transients - a pod had been in the area that week, & J pod was off W. San Juan late afternoon

Entry 2:
*
At

10:00 am
we were anchored at James Is. state park, eastern anchorage. Believe just off Cypress Is., saw approximately 12
Orcas
, heading south through Rosario passage, appeared to be mid-channel. First noticed them from huge splash, probably 1 1/2 - 2 miles away from our loacation. Saw two jump completely out of the water. Several tail slapping for 1 mile. Second smaller group of 4 or 5 following. 3 or 4 circled back after passing south of James Is., coming in towards the Island, as close as 1/4 mile, for 20 minutes or so. Entire sighting about an hour.
