Orca Sightings for May 25, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were going out of
Florence, OR
and a fishermen said secondhand that a friend had seen
orcas
the day before. This would indicate they continued north.

We joined others at Lime Kiln Pt. at about

12:45
, to watch
J pod
cruising by heading south. We followed them south, watching them pass closely by Hannah Heights from

1:30 - 2 pm, then lost them heading south into the fog at Salmon Bank. We were at the Center for Whale Research on the west side of San Juan Island that evening, & heard
J pod
was heading north. At about

7:30ish
(amazing how you forget to look at your watch when whales are in front of you!), we watched an incredible resting line, with all of J's lined up in a long horizontal line, side by side, all surfacing & breathing slowly together, right in front of the Center for Whale Research. After they rested, they continued north in a tight group - a wonderful & rare encounter for us!

J pod
in Speiden Channel, right up against the rocks on the south side of the Channel at
11 a m
. At

6:45 pm
, he reported J pod south of the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, a few yards south of Deadman's Bay, slowly cruising north, very close to the rocks.

I was listening to live sounds of killer whales today through OrcaSound. From approximately
1210-1240
I heard [
orca
] sounds from the OrcaSound array (north of Lime Kiln). I then switched to the Lime Kiln stream after only hearing vessels for about 5 minutes. There, I heard one vocalization at approximately 1250. I didn't hear any vocalizations on either hydrophone set after that (through about 1310).
