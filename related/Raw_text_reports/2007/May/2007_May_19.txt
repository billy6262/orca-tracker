I usually have the hydrophone from orcasound.net playing as i sleep. And this morning I was awakened at
4am
by
J Pod
! between 4 and 5 they were pretty quiet.. when 5 am hit, they starting vocalizing pretty heavily. For the most part they stayed within the Lime Kiln hydrophone range from 4am til about
7:30am. Attached is a recording I made from this morning. I also went out and saw them today on the south part of Stewart Island. Very spread out with some feeding behavior. take care,
