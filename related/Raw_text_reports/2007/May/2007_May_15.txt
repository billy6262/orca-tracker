Orca Sightings for May 15, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
J Pod
almost in the same spot as yesterday (west side of San Juan), going the same direction (west side shuffle until the afternoon when they headed north). But that's where the similarities ended. We were shut down watching J26 & a few others and saw J2 Granny about 200 yards away, but not very directional. J1 Ruffles had been way off shore by himself, but she must have called to him as he was soon traveling near her. The J16's were in a nice family group again today, and at one point they stopped their foraging pattern to do some playing around. Lots of sticking the tips of their noses out of the water for extended periods, followed by some spyhopping, and tailstands. It is so good to see the whales so active! We left the whales still heading northward at Open Bay.
