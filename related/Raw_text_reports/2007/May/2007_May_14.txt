Orca Sightings for May 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call tonight from John Vatsala, reporting an
orca
sighting from
8 pm
at the mouth of the Gualala River, about 52 miles south of
Ft. Bragg, CA
. He said there was a pod of from possibly 3-7 orcas, 200 yards south of where the river empties into the Pacific, in a shallow bay, in a feeding frenzy, going back & forth. He saw one especially large fin/whale, didn't see any seals in the area at the time of the sighting, or afterwards (or before - he visits the area often). He watched them for 1/2 an hour until it got dark, they seemed to be moving in a northerly direction while feeding.

We had a truly magical experience along San Juan's west side with
J-Pod
. They started out the day doing the classic "west side shuffle" before deciding in the afternoon to pick a direction and head up island northward. For a slight change of pace, J-1 Ruffles was actually in the rear of the group, taking very long dives (one dive was almost 5 minutes long). J-26 Mike and some of the females (a bit too far to ID) were fishing along the strong rip at Edward's point. But as the whales neared and then passed Lime Kiln, they decided to breach repeatedly! As we were watching J-16 Slick and new baby and family traveling north of the lighthouse, we had a very nice viewing of the entire family unit except J-26 (who was still back aways). One juvenile decided to see how high he could leap out of the water, and completely cleared out of the water. Lots of vocalizations as they passed Smallpox Bay (County Park), and you could even hear the echoes off the island.

Heading up the west side of San Juan Island, we spotted all of
J pod
around Andrews Point, including the newest member, 2 week old J42, and followed them to the north end of the island. Lots of spyhopping, porpoising, and breaching!

We live on North Pender Island, B.C., facing south onto Swanson Channel about 1.5 km south of Mouat Pt. We saw
J pod
, including the new calf, travelling westward between Pender and Moresby Is. (stopping to fish & circle at times, with a few breaches) at
4 pm
.
