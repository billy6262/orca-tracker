Orca Sightings for May 18, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Eileen Roberson of Sea Acres, called in a report of a mom & calf
orca
off east Orcas Island, south of Lawrence Pt, heading south at
7 pm
. We had an earlier report of J pod in this area, so likely these were J pod whales.
*
Orcas
off Lummi Island between

12:30-
1:30 p.m
. (right at the bottom of the low low tide)- very spread out, with a few groups (including mom with new little baby!) in close to shore, some in the middle, and some way out near Clark and Barnes Islands. Heading south into Rosario Strait - beautiful calm day...when the boat motors were shut down, could hear the breaths all around!

6:35 pm
, at Pt. Lawrence, S. tip of Lummi Island heading S, he first found them off Cherry Pt. earlier in the day.
