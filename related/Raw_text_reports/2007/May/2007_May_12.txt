============================================================

Entry 1:
We ran into
Ts
off Tatoosh last
night
(5/12) - they were just finishing killing a steller sea lion. it was T46s and T185, 186, 187. There was new calf in the group - I need to double check with Candi but I think she said it belonged to female from Budd Inlet capture.

Our first sighting of
orcas
off Lummi Island this year, but spotted fins out near Clark and Barnes Islands about
6 p.m
. Way too far out to ID (but probly our buddies the J's?) - they were very spread out across the strait - some breaches, and what looked like one of the teenage boys doing some circles with another very small finner - also big fin way off by Clark (J1?).
