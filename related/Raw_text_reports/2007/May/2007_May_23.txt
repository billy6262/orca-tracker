Orca Sightings for May 23, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were doing seabird surveys north of
Coos Bay, OR
. Approximately 12 km north of the bay mouth at about
0900
and ca 900 m from shore we spotted
Orcas
! checked them for 10 min. out and took some photos. The only good one I got is attached. Though I am a marine researcher, I didn't realize our info might be of research value or we would have been more diligent with our obs and photos. There were 2 females and a good sized calf, maybe 2/5 to 1/2 the size of the females. They were traveling north at a fast clip perhaps 6-7 knots.

I'm hearing [
orca
] calls/clicks currently (
~
4:30 pm
) on Lime Kiln hydrophone. I was pleasantly surprised to hear
J pod
via the live streaming audio signal from the Lime Kiln Lighthouse on San Juan Island Wednesday afternoon (

16:40-
17:45).

Today we witnessed "new" [
gray
] whale feeding pits...not all along the shore, only in front of the county road at Mabana Shores, Camano Island. They are probably from last night or the night before, since the low tides are during the day. There were not alot, probably around 35...which is not a huge number. Strange...but nature isn't always easy to explain. Dodie on Camano
