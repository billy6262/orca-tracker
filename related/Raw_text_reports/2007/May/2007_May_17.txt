Orca Sightings for May 17, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
What appeared to be a small
grey whale
surfaced right in front of our boat inside the breakwater at Neah bay at about

1:00pm
. We were coming back from halibut fishing and travelling at about 40 knots when the whale surfaced about 100 feet in front of us near the marker buoy. We immediately throttled back and shut down the motor, barely missing the whale as it went underwater. We didn't feel any contact but waited around long enough to see it spout a couple more times as it headed toward the strait. It seemed to be okay.

Rick Giddings Once again there were
Orcas
passing Mouat Point, N. Pender Island. From about
1800-1830
there were individuals and small groups slowly moving towards the Northwest, with some fishing behaviour right in front of the house. So nice to see, and not too many boaters around. J pod? I couldn't see anyone that I could identify.
