Orca Sightings for May 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had last seen
J-Pod
heading North in the night past Kellett Bluff.
John Boyd, Western Prince, San Juan Island
*
The whales are back at East Point, Saturna Island! We think
J pod
was by on Saturday morning around
9 a.m
. heading west but they were out mid channel so it was difficult to tell.

We were out there with you between the lighthouse and Hanna Heights between

2:30 and

3:30
- we were with Dan on the Orcas Express - the new baby is pretty amazing - she is so adorable - was trying to do all the tricks big whales do - we saw a couple of attempted breaches and one time it looked like she tried an attempted spy-hop - so cute

We stopped by the Lime Kiln Lighthouse at about
1 pm
, & heard
J pod
was coming down the west side of San Juan heading south. We took a chance & headed north to the Center for Whale Research, & got there just as J pod started to pass by going south, at about
1:20 pm. We watched them go by, VERY spread out - it took TWO hours for the pod to go by! But it did give us a chance to get a good look at & some video of J16 & her new calf, J42, as they swam by. I headed south to Hannah Heights to watch them as they continued south - they were at Hannah Heights at about
3:30 & still passing slowly by, very spread out, at

4:30
when I left.

A juvenille
gray whale
was photographed at Purdy Bridge (NW of Gig Harbor, Henderson Bay in Carr Inlet). It was hanging out just at the the bridge and then feeding inside the lagoon for about 2 hours. Last seen along the E. shoreline of Henderson Bay at
18:30.
