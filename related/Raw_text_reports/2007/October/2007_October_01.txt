Orca Sightings for October 1, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks for sending
J-pod
back up to the islands. It seems they left Puget Sound around
1
, as per your reports. Ken Balcomb reports hearing orcas on the Lime Kiln hydrophone last evening around
9 pm
Val Veirs, OrcaSound, San Juan Island
*
The Orca Network hotline received a call from Mark on the Victoria Clipper at

8:55 am
, reporting
J pod
off Double Bluff, milling in the rip tide.
*
The Orca Network hotline received two additional calls about
orcas
off Double Bluff at
9 am
- one from Hansville, reporting the orcas off Double Bluff & heading NW toward Mutiny Bay, & the other with a similar report.
*
John Hermann of Hansville reported the
orcas
still off Double Bluff at

10:10 am
, & by
10:45 am they were slowly moving NW, spread out over 1000 yds.
*
After living on Whidbey for one year we spotted our first
Orcas
today. We first saw them around

11:45am
on the west side of Whidbey, between Bush Point and the south end of Marrowstone Island. We saw what we think were 10-12 different whales, generally traveling north, although there were a few circling at times. We observed them for the better part of 45 minutes before they disappeared from view to the north. Having lived on the island for only a short time we can't identify them, but they were a pleasure to watch nonetheless.

We kept watching from the place we had rented on Bush Pt. (for Susan's B.day party), waiting for
J pod
to come by - at

11:20 am
they finally began cruisng by Bush Pt, heading NW, very spread out & lots of foraging going on. By noon they were spread out between Ft. Flagler, Lagoon Pt. & Admiralty Head, foraging back & forth across the inlet. At
1 pm
, we could still see 1 large male off Admiralty Head, & a few other occasional spouts & fins - at
1:18 pm we had the last sighting of the male off Ebey's Landing, still heading NW.

Lenore Minstrell of Lagoon Pt. called at

1:15 pm
to report a pod of
orcas
off the north end of marrowstone island.
*
Marilyn Wright called at

1:18 pm
to report she was watching a small pod of
orcas
from the
12:45 Pt. Townsend/Keystone ferry, milling off Keystone.
*
At about
1310 -1320
, while watching a sub outward bound thru binoculars and a telescope, we believe we saw 6 +
Orcas
moving about the same speed and in the same direction as the sub (Westward). They were surfacing and diving. The distance was great (from the bluff at the end of Donahey Road) and I cannot confirm they were indeed Orcas; however, the ferry which landed at Keystone about 1330, as well as the submarine, should have seen whatever it was we saw. Observation continued for about 10 - 15 minutes until the sub - and the Orcas (?) went out of our sight.

Scott Veirs of Beam Reach called to report a pod of 7
Transients
, including 1 male, at Kelp Reef at
3 pm
. This sounds like possibly the same pod we saw off Ft Casey on Saturday - Beam Reach obtained some photos so will get back to us with any confirmed ID's.
