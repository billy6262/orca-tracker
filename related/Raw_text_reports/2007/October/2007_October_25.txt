Orca Sightings for October 25, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I tuned in on OrcaSound at
8.40pm
and they're still hanging around!!
J's
are all over the place and occasionally I hear K's but I can only imagine L's being out there too.I've had the pleasure of seeing them all off Kellet Bluff this afternoon and it's great to hear them still finding enough food around here!

9 PM
and the
orcas
are still jabbering away! Must be around Kellett Bluff or so as they are pretty loud on Val Veir's hydrophone!

We had
J,K,L's
spread out from Darcy island- Kelp Reef- Kellet B luff foraging in the tide rips. At
1800
their direction of travel appeared to be southbound, pointed for Hein Bank/ possibly Admiralty Inlet; hard to say. cheers

Full moon sighting - spring tide at orcanet bluffs - i witnessed a daffy-style breech which resulted in an impressive cannonball splash in Haro Strait. soon afterward, a US Coast Guard buoy tender at the international border seemed to start its motor, rotate to the right as the new 360 degree propulsion engines can, and move out of the whales' path to comply with the new San Juan County Orca Ordinance, thereby reaching the relative haven of Canadian waters. Exactly how do the orcas 'hear' what we hear on the hydrophones? the moving USCG vessel possibly displaced some hiding salmon from its sides, as the manouver was followed by the whales' disappearance and repeated honing echolocation clicks.

I am in love with the resident Orcas up there, I visited in 2004 and that was it for me! I now live in Michigan and listen to OrcaSound every day- I arrived at work this morning at

8:00 am eastern time (5 am Pacific
) and immediately turned on the hydrophone. To my surprise I heard some noises (the first time for me live) so I recorded them. The file lasts around 17 minutes. Please let me know if you are able to use this or who it is.... I appreciate all of you and this opportunity to hear the beautiful animals up there! Someday
