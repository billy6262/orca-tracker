Orca Sightings for October 30, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Erin Falcone and I were conducting a survey for humpbacks out of Bodega Bay, CA when we ran into some familiar animals! We had the
L11's and L12's
slowly traveling and milling about inshore of Cordell Banks. We are staying in the area for the next few days in the hopes they are still around (and the weather settles down) to see if we can find them again. We have photos from all the animals in the group: L85, L22, L79, L89, L25, L12, L41, L77, L94.

Courtney and I got out there
late morning
after hearing that the leaders were rounding Turn Pt. We found the leaders out in the middle of Haro off the Battleship/Spieden area. They were incredibly spread out and we just tried to get as many proof of presence shots as we could. I'm pretty sure that just about everybody was there with the possible exception of the L22's and L12/L85 but the whales were so spread out that they could have been around too. Later in the afternoon, the whales seemed to be beelining it toward Seabird Pt. on Discovery Is. and we ended our encounter around
1600ish
right at Seabird Pt with our largest group of the day with L2, L78, L67, L101,L72, and L105 with K21, K40, and L57 nearby. The leaders at this point were probably approaching Trial Is heading west. It was a nice day and many thanks again for the call! Cheers,

A report came in from a resident of Saturna Island, who said "lots and lots" of [
orcas
] had passed their house. So we headed up towards Turn Point and lo and behold--- SUPER POD! Everywhere you looked were whales making their way very very slowly down Haro Strait. We saw lots of familiar fins, and had one unknown whale leap out of the water
with a salmon on his head!
Another repeatedly played with a kelp strand on her tail flukes. Soon more familiar whales were passing by including Ruffles, Faith, Racer, Cappucino, Raggedy, Skana, Lummi, and so many more! The only whales not accounted for were the L12's (but a report of L87 was heard). At one point there were four big males traveling together, and they mobbed the Center for Whale Research boat---it was interesting to see who was following who! Towards the end of the glorious afternoon, all three groups were passing Discovery Island and began heading west quite quickly, with one group of whales porpoising for quite a distance. As we watched the last two groups pass by us, one whale gave a beautiful breach and we knew we were getting a wonderful mid-fall treat.

A superpod of
Orcas
travelling west toward Turn Point passed Saturna Island this morning between about

8:00 and
10:00 AM
. Don't know how many were missing, but it must have been the bulk of the three Southern Resident Pods; a continuous procession comprised of small groups of up to a dozen or so, passing one after the next, visible from the shore for over two hours. One group of about 10 broke off to forage around the mouth of Narvaez Bay, Saturna Island, milling about for maybe 15-20 minutes. Overall, very fine display of every kind of breach, tail and fin slap, spy hop etc. that one could hope for. Nice!!!

I've been listening to OrcaSound (the north hydrophone, between Snug Hbr. & Andrews Bay), & at

12:15
began hearing calls of the Superpod - tune in for some great listening, should be picking up in the coming hours!
