Orca Sightings for October 22, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
SUPERPOD
! We were near Port Townsend today, and had
all 3 pods
slowly meandering northwest towards San Juan Island around

2:30 PM
. It was amazing--no matter where you looked, there were dorsal fins as far as the eye could see! They were spread out in small groups that would briefly come together, and then divide into different groups again. It was great so see so many familiar fins--J1 Ruffles, J26 Mike, K21 Cappucino, J16 Slick & her little youngster J42, K40 Raggedy, K37 Rainshadow, L54 Ino, L5 Tanya, and so many others. Lots of surface percussives including breaching, spyhops, tail slaps, upside down swimming and so much more. Lots of chasing fish too. Being an odd year, it's a good chum salmon year as evidenced by all the munching going on (not to mention all the commercial fishermen with nets out working away).

J, K & L pods

noon

Bob Whitney called Orca Network at

12:25 pm
to report at least 5
orcas
across Admiralty Inlet from Pt. Wilson, closer to the Whidbey Island side. He said they were very active, milling, foraging, & breaching. This must have been part of the So. Resident pods reported above.
