Orca Sightings for October 14, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Out on Boundary Pass at Patos Island, the fins appeared.
J-1
passed us first, fishing, and foraging away from the others a little, heading toward Boundary Pass to the west at

4:30 p.m.
The whales were spread out across the beginning of Boundary Pass all the way toward Saturna, East Point, from Patos Island light. J-27 passed us soon after Ruffles meandered off. Then along came J-11 and J-39. It was one of those grey, cloudy, but none the less, sunset evenings. The light on the water brought out all the silver grey highlights, and the whales headed off down Boundary Pass. We left for Friday Harbor at 5 p.m.
