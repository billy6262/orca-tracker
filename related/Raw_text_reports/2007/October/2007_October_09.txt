Orca Sightings for October 9, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the
afternoon
we had a magnificent pass at Lime Kiln. We had what appeared to be most if not all of the whales (
J,K & L pods
) pass by the light- spread out across the Haro Straits in windy, chilly and gray weather. Ruffles was keeping company with an unknown female (looks like he's had a good summer!) - and a lot of the J's passed a good ways off the shore- with both Ruffles and Granny in the lead. While we watched, we were hoping that some of the whales would make their way towards shore...and they did. We were lucky enough to have many of the L's and K's pass VERY close to shore- the stars of the day were Cappuccino (see photo above) and Raggedy! L110 also came in very close with mom and lots of other whales- playing in the kelp and lunging towards the rocks. It was a spectacular afternoon- I've attached a picture of Cappuccino at his best! Cheers!

John Boyd called us at about

3:45 pm
to say
all three pods
were off the west side of San Juan Island. Susan tuned into OrcaSound to a beautiful cacophony of calls on the OrcaSound Link (NW San Juan Isl) for over an hour, before having to leave the house - then Howie tuned in, and when Susan returned after
6:00 pm the calls were still going strong (shifting to the Lime Kiln link as the whales traveled slowly south)! How wonderful to at least get to HEAR them having a Superpod!

Those fortunate enough today (you had about 5 hours of opportunity) got to hear an
orca
symphony! All three pods were jabbering up a storm today
from about 2 pm until well after six pm!
I didn't even know whales were out until driving into town where I fortunately glimpsed J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny almost in Deadman's Bay (west San Juan Island)! Then while waiting in town, I got onto the high speed wireless and lo and behold---super loud vocals! Lots of talking going on, and for an hour I just sat and recorded all the vocalizations! Now I'm sitting here putting the vocals on CD and on my iPod so I can listen to the whales whenever I need to. About
5:30 PM, all the whales were turned around and I watched them from the back deck of the Center For Whale Research (thanks Kelly). Lots of foraging, rolling around, and in a very "casual" slow way. Great day! And the huge windstorm fortunately never showed up.

If you haven't already, turn on OrcaSound, there's a
SUPERPOD
live off the Center for Whale Research (west San Juan Island) and to the immediate north (

4:20 pm
). They were just playing/milling right out front, they're southbound now (6 pm), so I'm heading home, too.

Orca
on the hydrophone! I heard J's and L's were off Lime Kiln so I hurried home to catch some amazing vocalizations
between 6pm and 7.20pm
. But I can only imagine what went on before I tuned in.. They were clicking, squeeking, whistling and snorting abundantly. Echolocation clicks faded after a while, but they remained vocal. I didn't hear them on OrcaSound after, so heading south?
- A happy Ly
