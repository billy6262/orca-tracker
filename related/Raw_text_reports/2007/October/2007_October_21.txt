Orca Sightings for October 21, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported seeing about 5 - 6
orca
fins mid- strait in Juan de Fuca at about

3:20 pm
. They were too distant for ID's or more details.

As we were up near Turn Point, we got a call from shore saying that 1-4
orcas
were spotted somewhere in Haro around Kelp Reef. As we headed towards Beaumont Shoal, we saw a blow. First, two orcas appeared. Very pointed dorsal fins.
Transients
. Cool. Then more blows. Soon we had a group of
seven orcas
. We saw we had the T2's, and they were hungry!!! As we watched them from the side, we noticed most of them turn around abruptly and begin circling. Soon we saw the object of their attention--a harbor seal. They were like cats playing with a mouse, swimming by it a few times, sometimes pushing it around. Then all the whales dove and the harbor seal looked around confused. All the transients then surfaced pointing directly at the seal, and as they passed, the seal was yanked under water. A bit of thrashing, and the seal was lunch. Wow! The transients took their time with their meal, and finally finished and we last saw them heading south. We were with them from about

2:45 -
3:15 pm

Orca Network received a call from Elsa Leavitt reporting an
orca
off Bush Pt, west Whidbey Isl. at

9:05 am
. As she was talking, she saw another orca breach, then possibly a third orca - they were heading south. The Victoria Clipper was with them.
Then we received her full report
:
I just had my spiritual experience for the week! Shortly
before 9
this blustery morning I noticed a Victoria Clipper crawling northbound just south of Bush Point (w. Whidbey Island). That usually indicates a wildlife sighting, so I started scanning the water and, sure enough, saw an orca fin. I saw another whale far to the north, mid- channel, creating a series of huge splashes. Over the course of the next hour, I spotted probably
20 whales
, heading south and moving quite fast, except for a few millings and rollings. At one point, five surfaced in synch, very close together, all similar in size and shape. A few minutes later, three large females went by, very close together and close to my shore. I could just feel their awesome size and power through my telescope lens. The group was generally very spread out, and several large males were present. The Clipper delayed its trip for at least half an hour- what a treat for the passengers! Thanks to the captain for respecting the whales and providing the entertainment and educational bonus, and for letting me know the whales were out there.
