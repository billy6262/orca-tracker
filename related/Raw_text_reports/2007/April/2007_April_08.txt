Orca Sightings for April 8, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had the wonderful experience of kayaking out from the Langley Marina following the spouting of 2
gray whales
heading to Sandy Point--at about

10:00 am
. They were between Langley and Sandy Point for about an hour and then headed out to the channel and down toward Clinton. Later I spoke to Kathy from the Inn at Langley and she reported they had fed in front of the Inn for about an hour from

8:30-
9:30 as they had earlier in the week!

Spent weekend at LaPush enjoying the annual
gray whale
show. Saturdays display by a young adolescent was spectacular, breaching, spy hopping and playing in the swells. A big thank you to the Quileute Nation for their hospitality and for their support of the grays.
Chuck Owens, PCPW.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures had a
gray whale
sighted at Deception Pass, & F&W had reported a
gray
off Colville Island (off S. Lopez Isl).
*
0945
Bells Beach (N of Langley) Spotted one whale cruising and feeding beyond the buoy. Could only see his/her back and spouts, but the spouts were Smaller sprays, so maybe a juvenile? Fed for 45 min before Heading south.

We spotted what we believe was a baby
grey whale
in Liberty Bay, WA by Poulsbo. It's a shallow bay and it seemed strange to see a whale there.
