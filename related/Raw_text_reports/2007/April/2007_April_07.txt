Orca Sightings for April 7, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just spotted
gray whales
mid-channel south of the Mukilteo/Clinton Ferry. They were headed north at

7:30 pm
. My husband and I are not agreement. I am quite certain I saw two whale backs. He only saw one--perhaps a larger one with a smaller one but I am quite certain I saw two backs at one time. They were also spouting. We watched them as they moved from the Chennault Beach area of Mukilteo north towards Smuggler's cove and towards the ferry crossing which is where they should be about now.

We just got off the water and came in close contact with a
Gray Whale
feeding off of Seacrest Marina on our sunset paddle. The whale was milling about just between the Don Armeni Boat launch and Seacrest Pier headed north towards Duwamish Head at

7:30 PM
approx 150 yards offshore. Surfaced once then dove and disappeared.

gray whale
25' from shore off the Ebey's Landing (W. Whidbey) parking lot, feeding & heading north.

The ghost shrimp must be especially abundant in the mudflats below our yard because this morning beginning just after
8am
THREE
gray whales
have been feeding vigorously - circling together in tights circles less than 100 ft off shore. Two large, one small, their blows are unmistakable and loud in the quiet of a Saturday morning in Langley. While they've been feeding a good 20 minutes now, they seem to be drifting Eastward, toward downtown Langley.
