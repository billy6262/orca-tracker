The first whale we saw was my favorite buddy
J-1 Ruffles
. He was circling around something and making a lot of quick turns that left his huge dorsal fin laying sideways. Then the pod started heading South, but were actually traveling north since the current was pretty strong. As they neared Deadman's Bay, they looked to relax a bit, spending a lot of time at the surface just inside a nice quiet back eddy. Then 3-4 spyhops indicated it was time to move again. As we headed back to Snug Harbor, lo and behold there was
J-Pod
, angling out to greet us. J-22 Oreo and family were traveling near J-8 Speiden, and the best part of the day was watching J-26 Mike and J-27 Blackberry rough-house. Lots of rolling on top of each other, and taking turns pushing each other sideways and out of the water. J-26 did a huge breach. About

6:00 PM
, we left the pod slowly heading west northwest up Haro Strait.

It's ba-a-ack (the
gray whale
). Having lunch, would be my guess. In Port Washington Narows, west of Bremerton's Warren Avenue Bridge.

My mother and I spotted the
gray whale
in Bremerton this evening. We were at Lions Field, and the whale was across the waterway towards the westside of Bremerton. We drove to the end of Synder Ave and observed the whale swimming back towards to Warren Avenue Bridge.

We saw what had to be 3
grays
riding the

3:00pm
ferry from Mukilteo to Clinton. They were a ways away, but could see the tremendous spouts of water as they seemed to be playing and showing off. There were consistently 2 large spouts and one smaller one, so perhaps two adults and a youngster? We were too far away to tell for sure. When we first spotted them, they were very close to shore, north of Possession Beach a bit, near where Humphrey road ends, heading south.

We saw 3
Grays
together slowly traveling southward near the pier that sticks out between Sandy Point and Columbia Beach. The 3 stuck together as a "pod" would the entire time. I believe they were resting. We maintained 150 to 200 yards for just under a half hour. At the end they surprised me (they had come to us) and we got a closer look at 100 yards in the flat calm waters. Our total time spent with them was 32 minutes.

12:43 to
13:15
We found the same group (still in "pod" formation) still heading south near Glendale @

15:50
. This time I was able to clearly see that one was "patch" and another had a horizontal thin band of white running along three quarters of the tail fluke. Interesting to see these three grays in close formation the entire time.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research called to say they'd been out with
J pod
, after an alert from Mallard (below), catching up with them at

2:30 pm
at Salmon Bank heading north. They left them at
4:45 pm off Pile Pt. heading south, but they must have turned north again because at

5:55 pm
J's were heading north past the Center for Whale Research off NW San Juan Island. Dave said all of J pod was present and accounted for, always a good thing to hear!

1300hrs
1 mile south of Eagle Pt, San Juan Island, East bound
J pod
.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report 1 single male
orca
4 miles out from the N. Jetty Lighthouse on Cape Disappointment at

5:30 pm
.
*
David Freed of Clinton called to report seeing 2
gray whales
mid-channel, Possession Sound from the Mukilteo ferry dock waiting for the

5:30 pm
ferry. Once on the ferry, they saw the whales again, still mid-channel but heading north toward Hat Island.

I'm not an expert, but I watched what I believe to be two
gray whales
bottom feeding in pretty shallow water in Crescent Bay (Salt Creek Beach/ Tongue Point) outside of Joyce, WA. This was between

10:30 and noon
. They may have been there before/ after I was at the beach. We observed spouting every 6 min or so and they seemed to be staying in the same general area the whole time, right off the beach.

4 (confirmed)
gray whales
feeding at Mabana on w. side of Camano from 6:ooam still going strong at

7:00am
. Extremely close in to bluff. It is high tide, but they are about 75 feet from bottom of bluff. After 2l years of observing these creatures, sightings such this are rare and breath taking. 2 at drop off heading into Saratoga passage.
Dodie on Camano

10am
