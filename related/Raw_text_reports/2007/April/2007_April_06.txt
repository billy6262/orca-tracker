, on the north side of the canyon, heading NW. The pod included 1 adult male & a calf.

10:30-
11:30 AM
, we were kayaking off Langley marina. Two
grays
were in the passage swimming between Camano and Whidbey, then swerved over to the Sandy Point area and made they way feeding back toward Langley. Seemed to be two adults, maybe one younger adult as it was less barnacled than the other. We watched them quite a while then they swam out to center channel and around Sandy Point.
