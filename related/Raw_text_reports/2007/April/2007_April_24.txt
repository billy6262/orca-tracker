Orca Sightings for April 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research called to fill us in on he & Katie's encounter with
J pod
off west San Juan Island. J's went south down the west side of San Juan Island in the afternoon, then up San Juan Channel. They left them heading north at Turn Pt. at
7 pm
. All were present & accounted for, several of the boys (J26, 33 & 34) were rolling around & playing with their sea snakes.

We left
J Pod
at Eagle Pt. headed East along the south side of San Juan Island this afternoon at

4:00 pm
. Also, I got a report from a ferry passenger that Orcas were spotted from the Orcas to Friday Harbor Ferry this evening at about
6:30 close to Friday Harbor going up San Juan Ch. They could have been J Pod or Transients. J Pod does San Juan Ch. sometimes in the Spring.

Just had 2
grays
out in front of our house, about 200 feet out (North Bluff, N. of Greenbank, Saratoga Psg)! Flukes, spew and all!!! Heading from left to right (SE) past the old pilings at the end of Wonn Rd. Aren't we lucky to live here?!!!

My husband and I spent the weekend at the coast participating in the beach clean up and whale watching. We saw 6
Gray Whales
off Beach 1 at LaPush. We watched a mother and her calf eating approximately 100 yards off the shore.
