Orca Sightings for April 30, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a single
gray
right off of Kayak Pt County Park (Snohomish Co, Port Susan) last night about

7:20 PM
. It was lolling around very close to shore - maybe 75 ft from the picnic tables at one point. There was a very excited and noisy group of picnic- ers that likely pushed the whale onward, but it was in the shallow water near shore north of the Park

At

7:15pm
, a TRIO of [
grays
] - 2 large, one small - spent a good 30-40 minutes feeding along Langley's west end of First St. They came down Saratoga Passage, west to east, got to the Inn at Langley, then turned around and continued their circular feeding returning east to west.

At

11:00am
two
grays
at Mabana Shores at drop-off traveling North. It was low tide so no feeding on the flats. However, there were approximately 500 feeding pits exposed from the bottom of the county road to our place (perhaps a 10th of a mile). Also there were extremely small feeding pits very close to large pits. As to size of the larger pits, perhaps 10 feet in length. The smaller pits were perhaps 3 feet in length.
