Orca Sightings for April 19, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening at

8:15pm
I was riding the ferry from Mukilteo to Clinton, just by chance I caught sight of a fluke...not sure what type of whale it was, it was not very large, and it was just after sunset and the light was fading. The whale appeared to be heading west toward Whidbey Island.

We finally have a sighting to report from Meeresstille, our little sailboat out of Edmonds. We headed north this afternoon under sail and about

4:30
were nearing the southern entrance to Possession Sound (near the Possession Pt bouy). We spotted whale exhausts to the west, near the Scatchet Head bouy and tacked over that way. We saw a round of spouts again, probably near the western edge of the shelf, still a ways in the distance, but could make out backs and tails. We didn't see them in that area again, but saw one whale traversing Cultus Bay, heading east. On our way back towards Edmonds, around
5:30 we observed one last
gray
swimming North basically towards the middle of the entrance to Cossession Sound.
