I was on the

6:20
ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge this evening and saw (with a bunch of other people) a
whale
swim along the face of the downtown piers away from the ferry terminal towards and past the aquarium. The ferry crew supposedly announced that it was a humpback before I boarded the boat. It swam just a stone's throw off of the faces of the other piers toward and beyond the aquarium, spouting regularly. I last saw it near the pier face beyond the aquarium. By that time the ferry got underway and we lost sight of it.

We saw 5
killer whales
off the cape flattery trail lookout. They were hunting between the cape flattery lighthouse. We did not see any seals or fish eaten directly, the gulls were flying overhead so we knew they were feeding. There was one large male, one imature male, two females and one baby. they were catching fish, breeching, tail slapping. we noticed all the seals in the area were on the island, and when the whales took off going south in lazy circles eating/chasing as they went, the seals took off heading north. I have pictures, but I cannot tell you if they are good enough.
This was about
1:00/30
.

Jenn Dohner here again. A couple of
grey whales
were spotted today when I was on the mulkiteo ferry heading back to the island, around

2:40pm
. We could see them pretty far off in the distance, too far for me to catch any shots, unfortunately, but glorious to see nonetheless.
