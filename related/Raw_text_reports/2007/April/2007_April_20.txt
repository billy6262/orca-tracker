Orca Sightings for April 20, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
While searching for "Barney" a resident Gray Whale native to the Crescent Bay-Chito Bay area of the Washington side of the Juan de Fuca Strait, we stopped and were admiring the large pipeline breaker on the reef northwest of Crescent Bay Headland. After a few minutes sitting and searching the waters for any sign of a whale, we were suddenly surprised when we spotted a male
orca
fin rising in the foam of the breakers. Moving closer to investigate we discovered
T51
(the male) and a companion female
T49C
lunge surfing over the rock into the oncoming breaking waves. The two played in this manner for nearly 10 minutes, letting the strong flood tide reset them back over the rock again and again. It was amazing to watch. We followed offshore as the pair tired of the surfing game and continued west. shortly there after the female suddenly began acting erratically, lunging and other typical predatory type behavior. within a minute a large burst of bubbles and blood hit the surface and she rose from depths with a large piece of Harbour seal in her mouth. It was a briefly bloody spectacle as the the whales shared the kill, socialized over their meal and then continued westward towards Pillar Point.

I spotted a single, small
gray whale
breaching about 6 times heading north of Lilliwaup Bay, Hood Canal at about

12:45 pm
. It was very close to shore and was very spectacular. The tide was fairly low and the water calm. I last saw a gray whale in the canal about 15-18 years ago during shrimping season.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at 1 pm to report FIVE
grays
off Possession Pt, milling & feeding in the water column. One of the whales was Patch/#49. He'd never seen this many grays at once!
