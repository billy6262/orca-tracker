Orca Sightings for November 4, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Sylvia & Tom Stinson of Bush Pt, Whidbey Island at

12:53 pm
- they had been watching a pod of
orcas
heading south off Bush Pt. since about
12:30. They saw at least 8, including 2 adult males and what looked like a calf, breaching & feeding.
Thanks to their call, we were able to grab our binocs & jump in the car, looking for the whales - we first found them at
1:30 pm. We were watching from south of Bush Pt, & the whales were WAY across on the other side, very spread out between Foulweather Bluff and Pt. No Point, feeding. They appeared to generally be heading SE, but some were also turned & milling/feeding in all directions.
At
2:10 we went down & watched from Double Bluff, a bit further south, & were able to get a little closer view of them. We confirmed 3 males, one with J1's unmistakable fin, the others likely J26 & J27, though they were still too far for photos. They continued milling about, giving a sailboat & several motor boats who had stopped in the water a great show, & some were approaching Pt. no Point. We went to Scatchet Head on S.W Whidbey, thinking they would continue south, but they never arrived, so we headed back north, & watched them again from Maxwelton Beach at
3:30 pm. They were still milling & showing some direction changes, but they were north of where we had last seen them, now closer to Foulweather Bluff than Pt. No Point, & seeming to possibly be heading more northerly. So they were basically feeding in front of the Hansville/Skunk Bay area for several hours.
