heading So. passed Pt. Robinson and then I rushed to Neal Pt. and observed with my telescope a mother with new born attached to her side and a large orca. They were at Delco Pt. I watched as the mother went up and down with tiny one at her side. They entered Commencement Bay. Then the orca Pod arrived at Neal pt.
