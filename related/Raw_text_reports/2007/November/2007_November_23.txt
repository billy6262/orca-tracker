Orca Sightings for November 23, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just outside of Quartermaster Harbor, south of Piner Pt. we saw
J-Pod
, in three groups of 4-7 individuals each, heading south, fairly quickly, towards Dalco Passage at approximately

2:30pm
. A few males were noticed.

Courtney Stevenin called to report
J pod
again at

12:28 pm
right off Gold Beach, Maury Island, about 1/4 mile off Glacier dock. By
12:30 they were 100' offshore from the dock in about 50' of water.

Amy Carey continued calling in updates on
J pod
, at
1 pm
they were off Piner Pt, Maury Island, heading south in 2 groups. They spent several hours off Neill Pt, S. Vashon & then headed back toward Maury Maury Island, traveling close to shore.

2:30 pm
on Friday - the orcas (
J pod

At

3:45
, from Dash Point State Park (NE of Tacoma), Kevin sighted a pod of
Orcas
moving northward. There appeared to be at least twelve individuals in two somewhat separated groups. At least two of them were males, one having a larger dorsal fin than the other. The pod was surfacing and blowing often as it traveled close to the Maury Island side. At one point several individuals stopped their progression northward and we saw four spyhopping maneuvers, quite a bit of milling about, a few leaps nearly out of the water and more frequent blows for about 8 minutes. After about 25 minutes of total viewing time, we were chilled and it became difficult to see the whales with our small spotting scope, in the distance, with all the boat traffic and choppy water.

On our morning trip we spotted a
small baleen whale
(N 47.43.785/W 122.23.600) on the East side of the Sound. The whale was doing short transit dives as it swam (north bound) quite fast towards the shore, then hugging the shore. I was not able to get a great id shot, we called it as a minke due to location and commonality, but the dorsal fin did not look right, and the behavior was different. Possible juvenile humpback? It was about 20ft ish. We never saw the pectoral fins, but there was white on the underside of the tail, and the placement and shape of the dorsal fin was concurrent with a young humpback. Did anyone else see this one?
Afternoon
: We caught up with
J pod
just off Piner Pt. (south Maury Island). The sighting began at

15:24
, with the pod in two groups heading northbound, roughly in the southbound shipping lane. They milled around for a bit at
15:44 off Gold Beach, still in 2 groups, the first of which was only about 200 yards ahead of the other. We stayed with them for about 30 min, leaving at
15:56, in which the pod traveled 1.3 miles north towards Point Robinson.

Report of
orcas
on S side of 3 Tree Point at

9:45 AM
. We just saw them from about
10:54 still on S side of 3TP. They appear to be traveling South about midchannel. They did seem to be milling. Then they moved out. They are getting closer to Pt Robinson & seem to be moving closer to Maury Island. We were just told that they had been just off the beach on the south side just below us which is South of Quartermaster across the Sound. Can not tell how many -- seems at least 9. They were spouting often seeming to be right on the surface. That was before they really headed S & E toward Pt Robinson.

Amy Carey was out looking for the whales from shore, and found
J pod
at

10:55 am
, heading south near Des Moines, closer to the mainland side. At
11:30 am, they had crossed over closer to the Maury Island side and were near the Glacier dock, continuing south.

Jean Estevenin called at
noon
to report a pod of
orcas
at Sandy Shores, between Pt. Robinson and Gold Beach, very close to shore breaching & feeding in the Maury Island Reserve.
