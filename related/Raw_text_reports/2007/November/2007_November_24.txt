Orca Sightings for November 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed over to the west side of Whidbey Island after receiving the call of
J pod
off Mutiny Bay, and found them at

10:05 am
off Lagoon Pt, heading north. We watched them pass by, spread out and doing a lot of foraging, milling, direction changes, breaches and tail lobs. From

10:25 - 11 am they were spread out between Ft. Flagler, Marrowstone Island and Admiralty Bay, Whidbey Island, still feeding, moving back and forth but still generally heading NW slowly.
We went to Ft. Casey & watched from the bluff, where we had a good view of them still just north of Ft. Flagler at
11:35 am, continuing the feeding frenzy with lots of splashes, breaches (including a calf doing multiple breaches!), tail lobs, direction changes & foraging behaviors. By
12:45 pm when we left, they were passing Pt. Wilson still heading NW, on the far side of Admiralty Inlet. We were pretty sure we saw the new calf surface several times, but it was in the distance.

We spotted a
whale
this morning at 9am, off Arroyo Beach in West Seattle (about 2 miles south of the Fauntleroy ferry dock). It was not an Orca, perhaps it was a Minke? It was very close to shore, about 200 feet off of our beach, swimming quickly to the North. I spotted the whale because I saw a large trail of air bubbles and I said to my husband, there is something big in the water, we figured it would be a large sea lion which we've seen a lot of recently. Then we saw it come up for air and saw that it was a whale not a sea lion or porpoise.

I got on the

9:10
Ferry to Vashon today and no sooner opened my car door to see a
whale
off the west side of the ferry. I rushed to the front of the deck and got everyone out of their cars. At first glance it looked like a humpback, but it had 3 humps or fins, so I think it might be another kind of whale. I am new at loving and watching whales so I am not too sure, but from the humpbacks I have seen in Mexico it looked a little different. The whale was heading north and it made my day.

Today at around
10am
, my wife and I saw what
may have been the juvenile humpback
mentioned in this morning's Orca Network Sighting Report. It was just off shore and passing by the Fauntleroy ferry dock in West Seattle heading north. It was doing short transit dives, and it was its large blow hole spout that first caught my eye. We were in our house quite a ways up the hill from the water, so couldn't make out any details. At first, I was hoping we were catching site of the Orca J Pod, but the small dorsal fin on this whale wasn't like an Orca. We lost sight of it as it continued on north past Lincoln Park.
