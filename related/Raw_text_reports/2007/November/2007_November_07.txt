Orca Sightings for November 7, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
While motoring south in a sailboat at about
4 PM
, we encountered a pod of
orcas
traveling north. The location was approximately 1.5 mi east of Yeomalt Point on Bainbridge Island. The orcas came within 30-60 ft of our boat as we traveled south, passing on our port side. There appeared to be about 10-12 individuals visible at any one time, but it was hard to count the exact number. I suspect there were more if we saw that many on the surface simultaneously. There was one very large fin, presumed male, in the center of the group. There were several much smaller orcas in the group as well.

Yes, this indeed sounds like J pod, with J1's big fin
& the new baby with them

Brad Hanson reported that
J pod
had been basically milling around in a big circle most of the day between Alki Pt, Vashon & Bainbridge Islands. At

4:30 pm
they were off Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island, and appeared to be heading north.
*
Amy Carey reported at

3:45 pm
that
J pod
was still in the Alki Pt. area.
*
KING 5 TV just showed about 3-4 minutes of a live shot of
J Pod
off of Vashon Island at

12:30 pm
(shot from their airplane SkyKing. Beautiful. I count 9 in a tight formation.

Amy Carey called & was watching the
orcas
from the Vashon ferry again at

12:30
, they appeared to be traveling east.
*
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called at

12:25 pm
& said NOAA was with
J pod
off Blake Island, heading south. They saw a new calf with J14!
*
At about
11 AM
the Coast Guard Sector Seattle broadcasted a mariner alert of a "pod of
orcas
" traveling north off Alki point. They rebroadcast at
11:42, reporting "several pod of orcas traveling north off Alki."

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called this morning to relay a 2nd hand report from someone who saw
orcas
off the Bainbridge Island ferry this morning at

8:15 am
. They were heading south.
*
Just spotted (

9:45am
) about 6
orcas
(at least one male) heading south near the north end of Vashon Island. They are spread out, travelling slowly, with the male mid-channel (between Vashon Island and Lincoln Park/Fauntleroy Dock) and the rest closer to Vashon. We're watching from Alki Pt. so hard to give specifics. Probably J's, eh?

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at
10 am
- she was on the Vashon Island ferry, and could see
orca
fins in the fog line, somewhere between Alki Pt. & the south end of Bainbridge Island, they were too far away to determine direction of travel.
*
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called at

10:05 am
to report the
orcas
south of Alki Pt, heading south and coming up on Lincoln Park. He confirmed J 26 among them.
*
Another call from Amy Carey - she received calls from people on the Vashon ferry, reporting the
orcas
at

10:50
, closer to the Seattle side but now heading north.
*
Jeff Hogan called again, the
orcas
(looks like just J pod again) are still heading north, about at Alki Pt. at

11:25 am
. NOAA Fisheries researchers are with them again today - hopefully they'll get more samples before the weather turns too bad!
