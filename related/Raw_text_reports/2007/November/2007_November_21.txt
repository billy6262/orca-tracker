Orca Sightings for November 21, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amy Carey left me a message that
orcas
were at Pt Robinson at

11:00 AM
. At
11:16 am I spotted them about 1/3 of the way toward Piner Pt. I saw at least one male, one spy hop, one tail slap and some milling around. There was a ship in the vicinity, headed southwest at the time. As the orcas got closer to Piner Pt. another ship came out of Commencement Bay heading toward Pt Robinson. The orcas reached Piner Point about 12 noon.
2:10 PM Orcas in Maury Island Aquatic Reserve at Piner Pt. headed toward Pt. Robinson.
2:55 PM Orcas in Maury Island Aquatic Reserve near shore, near Maury Island Marine Park.
3:38 PM Orcas in Maury Island Aquatic Reserve at Pt. Robinson.

We finally found the orcas at the south end of Maury island...
J pod
. And we were able to get a couple of fecal samples despite the windy conditions.

Amy Carey called to continue her updates of
J pod
off Maury Island - at

1:23 pm
a group of 12 orcas had turned and were at Neill Pt, S. Maury Island, heading S/SE, moving slowly. At
2:30 pm they were a few hundred feet off the Glacier dock, where they spent half an hour feeding. They stayed in the Maury Island Reserve until after
3:15 pm, close to the shore near the Maury Island regional park, then headed north, where they passed Pt. Robinson at about
3:45 pm, within 30 - 50 feet from shore, where a crowd of welcoming whale watchers stood & watched them pass by! They were moving slowly, continuing north in blustery weather. Amy also received a report from a friend who was on Lisabuela beach on the West side of the island at

1:30
. She had whales on the West side at the same time Amy had whales on the east side, so they had indeed split into two groups at that point: They saw spouts on the far side of Colvos Passage a bit to the south, and were there for almost 30 minutes before having to leave because of the cold. The pod seemed to have found something to occupy them since they stayed in pretty much the same place during most of the 30 minutes they were there.

Jade Grace called again with a report of just one
orca
heading south past Racoma Beach at

1:20 pm
.
*
Orca Network received a call from Amy Carey at
9:45 am, relaying a report from a passenger on the Vashon passenger ferry of a pod of
orcas
off the north end of Vashon Island heading south at

8:15 am
. She found the pod at
9:55 am, between Three Tree Point & Pt. Robinson, Maury Island still heading south. At
10:56 am they were at Pt. Robinson, and she was able to confirm them as
J pod
. By
11:13 am they had come around Pt. Robinson, moving slowly. A cargo ship, the Greenwich Bridge, blasted right through the pod, after which they did multiple breaches & spy hops. At
11:35 am she said they were still heading south, not quite to Brown's Pt. At

12:05 pm
they were directly off Gold Beach, heading into the Maury Island Reserve.
*
Jade Grace called the Orca Network hotline to report a pod of
orcas
off her deck at Racoma Beach, between Pt. Robinson and Gold Beach, at

11:25 am
. They had been heading south, but as she was talking to me she said they stopped and seemed to be milling, hopefully feeding!
