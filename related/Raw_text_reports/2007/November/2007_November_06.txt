Orca Sightings for November 6, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just letting you know that on the 6th I heard a few reports from other fishermen on
Orcas
near Pt. Defiance in the morning,
before 11am
. I didn't see any myself though.

J pod was seen off central Whidbey Island at
3:30 pm, so it's doubtful this was J's. We did have some Dall's porps reported off Three Tree Pt. at
1:30 on the 6th, & on the 8th we had a 2nd hand report of some possible Transient orcas off Vashon - not sure which these were - sb

We live on the west side of Whidbey Island, about 1/2 mile south of Lagoon Point, just north of South Whidbey State Park. Looking west towards Marrowstone Island, this afternoon around

4:00pm
I spotted about a half dozen
Orca
moving in various directions. They were mid-channel and after 15-20 minutes started to generally move south. Most were just milling about, but a couple of them were rolling to their side and slapping the water with their pectoral fins. It was mostly cloudy and with the sun setting I was unable to get any pictures, and was hoping they might stay in the same general area so I could see them again on Wednesday.
Later that night: It was such a pleasant evening tonight that I decided to sit outside for awhile and enjoy the peacefulness of a quiet
evening
under the stars. There was no wind, very little shipping traffic, and the water was very calm. Waves occasionally lap at our beach, but I began to hear sounds that weren't quite right, something I had never heard before. After a few minutes the sounds grew louder, and it quickly became apparent that I was hearing several
Orca
spouting not more than a half-mile off our beach. I also heard quite a bit of vocalization, most of which sounded like young lambs. What eerie and fascinating sounds, something I have never heard before in person...truly amazing! I have a night-vision scope, and was able to watch them swim about in the water as they slowly drifted to the south. They stayed in the south end of Smuggler's Cove between my home and Bush Point for about 20 minutes, then slowly moved south towards Bush Point as the sights and sounds faded away.

I was not home to see them but apparently we had a pod of
Orca
very close to shore at the south end of Lagoon Point today (around

3:30-
3:45
). I understand that my neighbor counted 11 in the pod. We live just south of the entrance into the Lagoon Point waterway and by the time my wife got home they were near mid channel heading north.
