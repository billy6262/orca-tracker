We heard about transients in Georgia Strait and went to go take a look. We saw about about 5
transients
, I believe they were the T2s, and T2Cs, and they had been working their way up Rosario Strait through Alden bank and heading in the northwesterly direction at a pretty fast clip as we followed. They seemed to be clearly varying their path as a tour boat operator or two came too close.

On your orcasound---very beautiful vocals!

11:15 PM
. Lots of whales coming South past Low Island/San Juan County Park at
11:45 PM. Don't know who they are, but they are making lots of whistles, which I've never heard before. Lots of breaches and tail slaps judging by the sounds out there. Beautiful moonlight, whale vocalizing on the hydrophone, and blows outside. Very beautiful. Later: Ok listening back to the vocals I'm pretty sure we had K pod just pass by.

At about
2pm
there was another purse seiner incident near Lime Kiln Lighthouse.
J and K pods
were approaching from the south. A purse seiner (same one from the day before) came up and began to put in his net as the whales were approaching from the south. The seiner appeared to be directly in the path of the whales and they were about 1/2 or a bit less off shore. Some females and juveniles approached, the net was still being put out. The seiner continued and the whales continued on their path. It wasn't long before the men on the purse seiner began to bang the side of the seiner with heavy objects making sounds loud enough that could be heard from shore. (The banging occurred on the south facing side of the boat - where more whales were approaching.) Faith (L-57) was one of the approaching whales and there were others behind him. Vocalizations over the hydrophones began in a repeated call and it got louder and louder. The approaching whales stopped and just remaind at the surface. The vocals continued and when the whales turned and moved off to the south - away from the seiner - the loud vocals stopped. It appeared as if some of the whales had gone directly into the net area, but difficult to tell from a distance. There were whales to the right of the seiner and they began to move back toward the south. Faith began to go south and then he turned and went back north toward the seiner and traveled along the left outside edge of the net. He then turned and began to go back south. A few minutes later other whales that had gone north had turned and gone south as well. People along the shore were extremely upset by what they were seeing and hearing. The WFW Research boat was there again. There was a definite direction change made by the whales. With all the attempts to protect the whales and the boats around the whales, seeing what I witnessed yesterday seems to be very intrusive into their habitat.
