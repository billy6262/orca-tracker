My folks were at freshwater bay, west of port angeles, and saw a 'whale' off the beach there. Not sure what kind.

I had several calls that
orcas
were indeed back in the islands after a 5 day sojourn out to sea. Members of all three pods were sighted. I actually saw a few whales heading north in Open Bay (W. San Juan Island) (no ID's). Also saw some whales I heard were L's were hanging around False Bay around
