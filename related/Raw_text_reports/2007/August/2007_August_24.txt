Orca Sightings for August 24, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pat Ness of Chito Beach Resort, 7 miles west of Seiku, called to report 3
gray
whales off the Seiku breakwater at Olsen's resort. She also reported 2
Humpback
whales from
August 24 - 26, going back and forth between Seiku & the west (entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca) for the last 3 days.
*
At Crescent Bay north of Port Angeles. A whale, most thought a
gray
, though none of us has any expertise, spent virtually the entire last two days back and forth 150 yards off-shore. Appeared to us approximately 20 - 30 feet long, no dorsal, all by itself. Others at the camping area said there had been at least one other on Thursday.

My husband and I were part of several people who observed a pod of
orcas
from the Sturdies Bay ferry terminal on Galiano (BC Gulf Islands). The sighting took place from about
7am
until they were out of sight at around 745am. The pod was playing, splashing and jumping with loud slaps for a while in and around Sturdies Bay, and then slowly headed east out of Active Pass and slightly south into the Georgia Straight...they continued to jump, slpash and make loud slaps. There were about 7-10 whales, but I could not see details or markings because the sun was shining brightly behind them!

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report
So. Residents
passing by the Center on W. San Juan Island at about

8:55 am
, heading south, & that J's were at Eagle Pt, San Juan Island at
1 pm
. He'd also heard calls on the hydrophone at
midnight
.
*
Serene
morning
brought with it the unmistakable sound of
orcas
passing through Active Pass, their gentle exhalations alerting us to their presence. Coming in three waves separated by about a kilometer each, they stayed very close to the shore of Mayne Island after rounding Helen Point, their steady progress interrupted by the occasional tail slap.

I visited the Lime Kiln (OrcaSound.net) website tonight and had the pleasure of listening to the southern residents - they got very active around

2:45am
