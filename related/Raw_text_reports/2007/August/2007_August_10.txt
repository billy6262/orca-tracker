Orca Sightings for August 10, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a whale right by South Indian Island County Park in Oak Bay. It surfaced there about 4 -5 times over a 2 - 3 hour period (about
2:00pm -
4:30pm) and then we didn't see it again. We heard a blowing of air and then saw a black hump back and large black tail. There was only one and it seemed to swim east - west for a while and then left heading east. I haven't seen it since and this is first time I've seen a whale out here.

We were fishing on the west side of Whidbey Island near the southern tip, due west of Indian Point at about
8am
. We were looking towards the stern of the boat (North) when we were startled to hear a loud whoosh of air. We both turned around to see a whale about 10 feet from the boat traveling parallel to our course in the opposite direction. It was gone almost as soon as we saw it. We watched closely but didn't see it surface again and the water was almost glass smooth. I have been puzzling about what kind of whale this was and spent some time with the Audubon Guide to Marine Mammals and now believe that this must have been a
Minke
whale. I've seen many orcas and it was definitely not an orca. It had a very distinct but small dorsal fin so this rules out a Gray Whale. It was gray colored but had no spots or mottling. As it came to the surface and then dove, it did not raise it's tail fluke out of the water. We saw the blow hole and the dorsal fin both out of the water at the same time. We didn't get a view of the head but the whale didn't seem to be all that big compared to other whales I have seen. The Audubon guide says that these whales are curious which may explain why it surfaced so close to our very slowly moving boat. Do you think that my ID is plausible? I am certainly no expert. Whatever it was, it was thrilling to see (and hear)! Thanks,
Fred

About

1:30
saw one
Orca
coming through the cut between Port Townsend and Oak Bay. Orca worked it's way out into the Hood Canal area. Thought it would go south, but it turned and over the next hour came back into Oak Bay. Stayed in Oak bay for the next hour within one area breaching several times. No other Orcas in site. Since this is my first sighting, I could not tell you if it was Male or female. About
4 pm
, it left the bay. Was seen by many campers at lower Oak Bay County Park, Port Hadlock, WA. Seemed healthy, could see no scars or other marks.
