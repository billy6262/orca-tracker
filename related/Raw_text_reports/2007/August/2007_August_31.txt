Orca Sightings for August 31, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
5pm
I saw a whale off the north tip of Marrowstone Island (near Port Townsend, WA). It spouted a straight stream like from a fire hose at least 20 feet high. I watched its long back, expecting to see a fin......long....long....then a smallish triangular fin. I walk and or fish the north end of Marrostone Island every year and see lots of whales. Have also worked as a biologist for 30 years, including some whale counts..............the whale surfaced a second time and again spouted at least twenty feet high, vertical stream, showing lots of back, giving me a good estimate of length. It was at least 60 feet long but I'm estimating 70. We (frequent fishers at the beach on Marrowstone) use containers that pass on ships as a measuring rod. They are 40 feet long and a good yardstick......Based on everything I know and read and am told, the Friday night whale was a
blue
. Very very very cool. A BC hydrofoil approached when I last saw the whale and I never saw it surface again. Thank you for all you do,

West of Victoria we saw two sets of
Transient
Orcas and two
Humpbacks
. On the late afternoon trip, both sets of Ts came together and socialized up a storm. I have never seen Transients having so much fun. And Race Rocks was covered with California and Steller Sea Lions. We also got to see some guys kite surfing on the way to the Ts, then got to follow the Ts as they swam through the surfers.

We had a 2 hr show in Victoria this evening
Transient
orcas just of the rocks by Trial Island. I know there are a lot of seals on the trial and they were cruising around the kelp beds. Then they went down for long time . Do they pin their prey on the bottom, how do they feed? There were 2 males like book ends of 2 babys and 4 to 8 females. The different behavior was very noticeable and the smaller curved fins.

Kathy Fritts of Freeland, Whidbey Island, called this
morning
to report a small
gray whale
in N. Swinomish Channel, heading north toward open waters.

For the past four days I have seen a single
Pacific White-sided Dolphin
from Point Wilson (NW of Port Townsend) looking to the E.N.E. in Admiralty Inlet feeding on bait fish around the tidal line from
1600- 1900
.
