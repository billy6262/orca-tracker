This afternoon (
1500-1545
) I received a tip of some Californian
Transients
out west Juan de Fuca. I came in contact with 2 unidentified male transients making very long dives, 10-12 min, reappearing almost 1/2 mile away sometimes and being incredibly elusive. No ID shots unfortunately. Noticed dorsal fin of one was very triangular, sharp, floppy like a sprouter. Whale watch vessel West Coast One had also been viewing and might have some photos.
