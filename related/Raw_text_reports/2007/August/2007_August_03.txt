At least some members of
all 3 pods
slowly passed the west side of San Juan Island, heading north at

10:30 am
. The orcas passed Lime Kiln Point State Park for more than an hour, hugging the coastline, much to the delight of all on shore!

Today on the

3:30
Ocean Magic trip,
J and K pods
were found traveling in pairs and groups northbound in Haro Strait moving past Boundary Pass towards North Pender Island - It's possible they headed into Boundary though because it seemed some were moving into the pass, not entirely sure what direction they took in the end as we departed for home at this point. Ruffles / J1 was cruising on his own which is not uncommon however he was not far from the others traveling in groups. Caught glimpses of the now famous J16 and new calf J42 as well as Raggedy / K40 & Cappuccino / K21 along with other family members. A breach from someone and an lovely spyhop (see photo above) from someone....

Around

6:30 this evening
, a small, (about 10 that we saw) very spread out group of
Orcas
went past us, heading east in Active Pass. They were zooming by on the tide; moving so quickly we couldn't do any identification.
