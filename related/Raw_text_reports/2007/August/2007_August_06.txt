============================================================

Entry 1:
Gray whales just off the shore near green point half way between port angeles and sequim. There have been 3 groups of whales here for about 2 weeks.

We were sailing when we sighted at least three
minke
whales, two adults and one juvenile swimming slowly back and forth in a relatively small area, mid channel between West Point off of Seattle and Bainbridge Island, at approximately
2 PM
. We observed the whales for about 15 minutesduring which the whales would occasionally roll on their sides, and flip their tails in the air.

On the

3:30
, we found lone
transient orca Pender / T14
traveling east in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Followed by this we sighted two
humpbacks
south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca - deep diving re: awesome fluking, followed by a wide group of the
southern resident orcas
making their way east towards Haro Strait. Blackberry / J27 and Alexis / L12 moved through on their own including a mother and maybe 2 year old breaching calf (didn't get a look at the saddle). The animals were spread miles wide across the strait with T14 well in the lead :)

It's
10.40pm
and there's a lot of squeeking on OrcaSound! What a wonderful way to end my day.. :o) I think it's Kpod and oh.. there's some clicks now too.. Yup! They're having fun out there! Later: Yup.. the hydrophone is still on. It's passed 11pm now and this time it sounds like J pod is out there.. Hm.. and I still hear members of K pod. I wish I could be out there too!

A most amazing day on the water today, above many others.
J,K,L pod
returned to our waters this afternoon (
1300
) Sheringham Pt, Juan de Fuca Eastbound along with 2 female
Humpbacks
, and
transient
orca T-14. Resident pods left in evening off Trial Island Eastbound spread out with a few miles. Transient T-14 also heading East while working the bays and shorelines along the way. Humpbacks positioned anywhere from 3 nm SW Race Rocks to 2 nm S Race Rocks, at some times very playful/ arial.
