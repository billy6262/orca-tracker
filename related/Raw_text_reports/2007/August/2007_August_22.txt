There was a huge group of
orca
which came down Boundary Pass. They appeared at Monarch Head around
4 p.m
. heading east and turning north in Georgia Strait. J1 was in the lead with some yearlings. After about 15 minutes the rest of J pod went by feeding. About 1/2 hour later it looked like K and L pods came by - some out toward the middle of the channel and some in close. We saw the new baby skipping the waves of his/her minders close to the end of procession. The last of the group must have gone by around

5:30p.m
.

The
Southern Resident Killer Whales
at Mitchell Bay, SJI, northbound. We were with the leaders - mostly J's, with a few K's and L's travelling along. The whales were spread over a large distance, with J1 usually well offshore, and the rest spread to within perhaps 50 yds of shore. We left the group Northbound at Speiden Channel. We located a small group of
T's
in the Strait of Georgia. The vessel I was on ended up being closer to the location of the eastbound SRKW in Boundary Pass as they approached Monarch Head. We were the only boat with the leaders as they passed by East Point into the Strait of Georgia. Before they headed into the Strait, they appeared to be waiting for others to catch up, as they were milling about under the cliffs for some time, and we heard on the radio that the whales near Turn Point were porpoising. Once J1 passed East Point, the rest of the group got on their way as well, passing within a few yards of the observers on the rocky shore near East Point. Travelling along with the J's were Spock and Comet (K20 & K38). The vocals were amazing! Located a small group of
T's
in the Strait of Georgia, just east of Georgeson Pass. The T's put on an impressive show, with several forward breaches, spyhops, tail lobs and tail stands. There were a total of 7 animals - 2 calves (neither were 'pinkies'), a juvenile and 4 that appeared to be adult females, or subadults. We left this group northbound at the south end of Mayne Island at approx

13:00
. On the afternoon trip, our boats split up to try and locate the T's again. They were found 3 miles North of Active Pass, on the east side of Galiano Island. Our other boats watched this group as they continued Northbound, eventually leaving them Northbound in the Southbound shipping lanes, approx in line with Porlier Pass. During their encounter they observed breaching, spyhops, tail slaps and at least one seal kill/flinging. No vocals were heard.

Southern Residents
Have Returned!!! As of

2:30 PM
, J-Pod was heading UP Boundary Pass instead of the usual-of-late Active Pass route, K- Pod just passed by the Center & Kellett Bluff, and L-Pod has decided to wander around the southern end of San Juan. At least for a change, the whales have shown up BEFORE 4 PM, and are actually past the Lime Kiln Lighthouse. Maybe this means there are fish around and they may decide to stay a few days this time?

I called Jim Maya about 11 AM this morning and he was north with
J-pod.
It was K and L pod here no doubt, enjoying this lovely day and traveling south along the west side of San Juan Island south of the Limekiln Lighthouse at a slow pace.

This morning I got a wake up call from
K pod
on the Lime Kiln hydrophone at
10.30am
, though I'm not entirely sure 'cause i was half asleep.. ;o) After returning to dreamland for a while, J pod woke me up again at noon, just in time to hurry myself to work. Haha.. no more alarm clocks! Seriously, this is the best way to wake up! Not really reliable, but still.. Thanks J pod!! Anyways, they were squeeking away and around 12.30pm I started to hear some clicks too.
A happy Ly
