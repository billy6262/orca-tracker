Orca Sightings for August 26, 2007
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a
gray whale
in the evening just east of Neah Bay along the straits, close to shore

About
5pm
I saw one
minke
whale swimming east to west off the north tip of Marrowstone Island (near Port Townsend, WA). It surfaced several times, showing no blow and its slightly hooked dorsal.

Transients
spotted between

1:45 pm and
3:15 pm
. T19 and T19B are clearly part of this group (with T19B being the sprouter). There's some question as to the identity of the third orca. A person on another boat thought T18 was with the group, but the orca in this photo appears to be much smaller than the other two. Could it be T19C?

Pat Ness of Chito Beach Resort, 7 miles west of Seiku, called to report 3
gray
whales off the Seiku breakwater at Olsen's resort today, 8/27, at noon. She also reported 2
Humpback
whales from
August 24 - 26, going back and forth between Seiku & the west (entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca) for the last 3 days, with the latest sighting being Aug. 26th between 4 &
7:30 pm off Seiku, then heading east.

The
T19s
were picked up again today at Java Islets at about

11:30 AM
. Last I heard they were heading up Trincomali Channel. No sign of the T30s yet today, however, in the late afternoon a group of Transients were found south of Trial Island.

At Crescent Bay north of Port Angeles. A whale, most thought a
gray
, though none of us has any expertise, spent virtually the entire last two days back and forth 150 yards off-shore. Appeared to us approximately 20 - 30 feet long, no dorsal, all by itself. Others at the camping area said there had been at least one other on Thursday.
