Orca Sightings for February 2, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

11:45am
- The location was
between Pilot Point and Eglon
, off the east side of the Kitsap Peninsula, south of Point No Point. The whales were traveling north. There appeared to be
about 4 of them
, but I doubt I photographed all of them. One surfaced just after the main group passed us, and I had already put my camera away. After passing us, the whales went down and we didn't see them surface again. It's pretty special to see (and hear!) orcas so close! - Dianne Edmonds

Anyone else see what appeared to be
a mama and calf whale (not orcas) swimming through Colvos Passage
northbound closer to
Southworth side around 2pm
today? Heard blowing, then caught them a few times as they swam through. Very nice surprise today! Bigger and slower than dolphins. Gray, maybe? - Amanda Lund
*
Noon Sunday, from Cape Meares, OR.
Watching southbound Grays from good vantage with excellent viewing conditions,
nine Grays in view all vanished
. We expected to see them again but they seemed to go into stealth mode. In distance to southwest, the
12 or so Orcas
appeared moving rapidly toward the north giving us a good view as they passed three or four miles out. They spent a minute or so delighting us with numerous high breaches. - Jim Border

11 am - Killer whale sighting. 3 killer whales, 1 mi. west of coho point on Texada island
. Traveling north bound. The first sighting of 2 or 3 orcas was probably about 3 miles west of Texada at approx 49 deg 46 min north and 124 deg 43 min west. They were heading north. We had a second sighting of at least 6 orcas about 20 mins later in roughly the same location again heading north. I know light distortion on the water can play tricks, but it looked like the second group had obviously larger dorsal fins. I have seen this in the past few years where the juveniles travel ahead of the main pod of adults. 2 years ago I had the juveniles come to my boat and lifted their heads straight up out of the water to check me out from a distance of about 100ft. I wish I could have gotten over my shock and taken a picture. - Rusty Kempe

12:43 - Watching them at double bluff.

12:39
heading west towards
foul weather bluff
. - Elyse Sollitto
*

12:20 - Jim Maya reported hearing orcas in the CWR hydrophone.
*
I happened to be up at
Point No Point
when word came that Orca's had been spotted at Eglon. (Just south).
They made a close pass at Point No Point
- close enough to hear them, and I got this shot of two of the orcas. A huge thanks to the people who called in the Eglon sighting, because I was just about to head home when I saw the post on Orca Network.

12:52 -
watching to the north, near a tug and barge. Spyhopping, tail lobs. They may have made a kill, and they seem to be staying more less in the same area.

12:27 -
Still headed north, more mid channel now. Almost out of sight.

12:06 -
I've got 3 heading this way toward Point No Point now.

11:58 -
just spotted them a little south of the point. They are moving fast. Not sure if it's just two or more.

11:52 - Between Kingston and Point no point
on the kitsap peninsula. - Connie Bickerton
Josh McInnes at The Transient Killer Whale Research Project ID'd them as T124 and T124D, the third whale was most likely T124E. They were tentatively ID'd yesterday with T087, but he wasn't with them this afternoon.
