Orca Sightings for February 16, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales sighted
from an observant waterfront home owner in
Victoria
I got out on
J pod and L087 resting and traveling north at 0900
. I left them north bound at
Kelp Reef at
11:30
moving slowly in two resting groups. - Mark Malleson

I was headed down to Snug Harbor for an
11:00 short trip. The amazing Jeanne Hyde had just heard that
Orcas had been sighted over near Kelp Reef
. We all headed over toward Canada in heavy seas. I assumed they were Ts, but
there were Js!
Here are some images. Because of the heavy seas we couldn't stay with them for very long, but we think they were all there. We did see
Granny and L87
for sure. - Capt. Jim Maya

2 pm -
Saw a whale, feeding and breaching from our home on bluff
just north of Lincoln Park
. First cetacean spotting from our home (moved to neighborhood last spring) so super cool and exciting! some more info: whale was
~20-25ft long
, much larger then the dall's porpoises. dorsal fin was small and curved back, and placement was much further towards tail then orca. Dark colored on top with light belly...fin and body profile matched online photos and images. - Daniel Budiansky
