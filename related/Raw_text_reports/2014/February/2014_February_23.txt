Orca Sightings for February 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
09:35 AM -
Sighting in
Copalis Beach (just north of Grays Harbor, central Washington outer coast
). A lone dorsal fin spotted just off shore in Copalis Beach. It remained close to shore for about 20 minute. It appeared to be interested in an area with a few floats up (crab traps) and where many seabirds were floating. The dorsal fin was evident and it appeared to move freely in the surf. Out a distance many blows and sprays were observed but I could not identify the cetacean. I was momentarily concerned it was going to get stranded (our home is just S of Griffiths-Priday State Park and 1.2 miles N of the remains of the whale that sadly washed up last year.) I think it is fine though. The dorsal was easy to identify as it was tall and triangular but there did appear to be a small notch (c shaped cut out) closer to the body on the side closest to the tail. - Tina Albrecht
