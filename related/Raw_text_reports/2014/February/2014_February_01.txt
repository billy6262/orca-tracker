Orca Sightings for February 1, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pod of
5 orcas seen rubbing just a few feet offshore on pebble beach, west of Sechelt. Behaviour continued for 1/2 hour
off Trail Islands, Sechelt, B.C.rubbing on pebbles (just offshore). When they left the beach they continued traveling west towards Sargeants Bay. - Janet Ansell
Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: With that little nick, I will go out on a limb and guess the male might be A66. Weren't the A42s somewhere in the Campbell River area last month?

Ron Bates reports that
12 transients were off Race Rocks
...all were female.

north again. Still east side of mid channel, but trending west towards

heading towards Jeff Head?

watching NOAA due west, in southbound shipping lanes mid

1pm
, the pod turned west and continued to Kitsap, many directional changes.

11:35 -
they have been hanging out for the last hour...200 yards from shore circling, tail slapping, breaching. Most likely on a kill...anticipating the thrust of finality here soon.

Identified as T-87 and T-86 At Edmonds Marina Beach.
*
We were send photographs of the
transients in Puget Sound
. Confirmed Identification of
T087
, and what looks like
T124E
in the following photograph provided by Janine Harles. T124E is a sprouting male we (Josh McInnes and Nick Templeman) encountered earlier in 2013 off Campbell River BC. T124E associates with T124 and T124D. It cannot be 100% confirmed on the ID from photos alone. - Josh McInnes, University of Victoria.

I believe the male is
T087
passing
Richmond Beach Saltwater park
southbound in glassy calm water. NOAA in their presence.

Rush Dalziel and I came across
transients in the Juan de Fuca Strait
. They were in 3 groups spread over a mile traveling east. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
*
My boyfriend and I saw
two shiny fins about 50-100 m from shore
- a large and a small - definitely orca shaped (and moved at speed) on
Harlyn bay, Cornwall UK
(1 feb 2014) between aprox 12.30 and 13.30. The larger fin had some white at the base. We didn't have a camera as we had intended to go surfing! It almost looked like a mother and calf in terms of size although they were swimming apart. They were only about 100 m from shore (if that). - Sarah Thornton
