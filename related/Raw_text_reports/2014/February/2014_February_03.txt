Orca Sightings for February 3, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Monday a group of
Pacific white-sided dolphins
was pursued and attacked by
Bigg's whales near Nanaimo
. A ferry passenger fortunately recorded the event and that video has spread far and wide, including in various news media. Below are two of the reports: Attack by orcas scatter dolphins near Nanaimo. Chris Dunagan: "At my suggestion, John sent photos to Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research. Ken reported that the orcas included
T-100s
. According to the book "Transients" by John Ford and Graeme Ellis, they are a group of killer whales seen mainly in Southeast Alaska." Killer whales hunt, attack dolphins near Nanaimo (with video). An increase in transient killer whales and white-sided dolphins in the Strait of Georgia led to a rare sighting of an attack between the two mammals on Monday near Nanaimo.
