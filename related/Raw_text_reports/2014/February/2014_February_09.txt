Orca Sightings for February 9, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Breaching gray whale near Edmonds
. Craig Smith of Edmonds shot these photos
Sunday afternoon
on the beach below the
Edmonds Senior center
. "I was looking out across the sound and the whale breached very close to a docked ferry," Smith said. "He then swam south, giving the folks on the fishing pier a very good view of several more breaches."
*
There were a large group 2
5-30 orca in Lambert channel Hornby Island
. They appeared to be transient animals. Some of our guests got photos of the group. - Rob Zielinski
*
10 am - about 30 whales - south end of Hornby Isle
, bottom end of Lamdert channel (40 miles NW of Nanaimo BC). At least 2 big males, maybe 5-6 little guys. whales were in small bunches, quite close together, lots of crisscrossing, sometimes submerged for extended time. Certainly no sea lions were in the water. They were all hauled out on Norris rocks. Maybe nearly a thousand sea lions. 3 days ago the 2 bulls were in front of my place - north shore of Hornby, facing the texada mine. I talked to Rob Zielinski of Hornby island diving who was out with clients today. He saw the orcas, he thought there were about 4 small ones, he thought they were transients. - George Stonehouse
Dave Ellifrit: looks like picture 2 is
T102 and picture 4 is T101A
.
Mark Malleson: ...the bull looks like
T102
so likely the T101's (mom and 3 sons). The T100's and the T090's were the ones in Departure Bay, Nanaimo predating on the Lags last week (photographed by John Ford/Fisheries and Oceans)
