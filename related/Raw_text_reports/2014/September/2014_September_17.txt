Orca Sightings for September 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nothing beats a flat calm, overcast day for whale photography! What a day with
J pod (group A)
at the T10 buoy north of
Sand Heads
(mouth of the Fraser River). Lots of socializing and J49 was being a little goof bouncing around playing with everyone but lots of time with mom, J37, rolling around on top of her. Here are a few shots. The first is the J14's, second is L87, J19 and J2 and the last two are of J49 goofing around. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Mark went out west to find
resident killer whales
as they headed out towards
to the Pacific
. There were also some
Residents near Vancouver
. Ocean Magic picked up a few members of J-pod, most notably Granny's family! Her grandkids were enjoying excellent fishing. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Southern Resident orcas were heading west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. - Sooke Coastal Explorations.
*
Yesterday I spent a calm, still morning with a
Humpback Whale in Rosario Strait
. It was so lovely out, good thing whales don't care about rain. - Traci Walter.
