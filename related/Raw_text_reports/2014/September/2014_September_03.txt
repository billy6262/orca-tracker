Orca Sightings for September 3, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
They found the
T065A's by Spieden Island
and spotted them hunting! They were traveling with another, unidentified group. Our photographer Marie is pretty sure one of the odd one's out was a lone female called T002! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whale Whale Watch
*
We traveled into Canadian water to see the
3 transient orcas
. I believe it was
White Rock
in the back if I recall correctly. I think there was a seal-hunt going on, several shots seemed to show whale with someone in the its mouth but most of them were too blurry to see clearly. - May Cheng
