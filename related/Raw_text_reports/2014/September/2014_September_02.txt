Orca Sightings for September 2, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon from

12:15-
1:15 I watched members of K-Pod
(at least the K13s and K14s) and
the L12 sub-group
go back and forth in front of
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
on San Juan Island. In the end, I believe Ks went north and L12s went south, but there were some very far away whales and a rain squall started to obscure the view! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island.

I have attached two photos of
L pod taken on the West Side
on yesterday's (9/2) very rainy tour. Both photos were taken aboard the M/V Sea Lion. - Sarah McCullagh, San Juan Safaris.
*
Yes!!!

2:00 Am and JPod
is on the
hydrophone
!! If this were winter I would be heading out there right now- luckily I'll be able to see them tomorrow hopefully. - Heather MacIntyre

12:26am - Hearing orcas off of lime kiln hydrophone
now ...not sure who it is. - Emily White
