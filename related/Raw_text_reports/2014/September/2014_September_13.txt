Just spotted a lot of them while flying up to Friday Harbor. They are off the
southwest tip of the island
. We watched them for 2 hours this afternoon there. They kept going back and forth. What an amazing show! They were headed north. They ended up making their way up a little farther north (we saw them from
Lime Kiln at
4:50pm
) but then they went back south a ways and we saw them again just southwest of San Juan Island (couldn't really tell which direction they were going) a little before 7pm. - Sarah Abare

Skyline marina and Burrows Pass (Anacortes)

About half way between
Port Angeles and Victoria

humpback
that was in the south Sound in August. - Connie Bickerton.
*
An added bonus this morning - three lags!
Pacific white-sided dolphins
are often called lags as an abbreviation of their genus, Lagenorhynchus. They're common further north in British Columbia but pretty uncommon here, though there's been numerous sightings of small groups around the San Juans this summer. This was my first ever sighting of them here though! They proceeded to make a beeline for
J26 Mike
, who looked like he didn't want anything to do with them. - Monika Wieland.
