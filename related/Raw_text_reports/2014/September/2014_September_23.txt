Orca Sightings for September 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:29 AM - Transient Female Sighting
. Have repeatedly seen a large transient female hunting the patch
between Speiden, Johns, and Stuart Islands
on 9/23 and 9/24. She was driving all the seals onto shore, and hunting the area between Gull Reef and Johns Island. For the past two days we have seen her on four separate occasions, circling around the area. - Andrew Clark

Shortly after
3 PM orcas (Js and the three Ks)
were heading
north off Lime Kiln
while
a humpback whale (Split Fin) was heading south
. They easily passed within a couple hundred yards of each other, which is always cool to see! I could only capture a distant picture, but it's my first time photographing the two species up at the same time. While watching the humpback, who reportedly was doing the westside shuffle all day, we also saw Dall's porpoise and harbor seals, making for four marine mammal species in the span of a few minutes! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
*
We encountered
J-pod at the south end of San Juan Island
. All the usual suspects were there including
Granny J2 and Blackberry J27
. These guys were traveling steadily north in tight family groups of 3 to 6. These dense collections of a few whales are ideal for viewing and provide valuable insight into how these whales organize themselves socially. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

7:31 -
Just heard some breaching or tail slapping on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
- no calls yet though for me! - Monika Wieland
*

7:14 AM - SRKWs vocalizing on Lime Kiln
. First heard a super faint call then waited to post until I heard a second (vocals continued for maybe a minute) and sounded possibly like Js but seriously was holding my laptop up to my ear. I have not heard any since and now the ship. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Entry 2:
Brad Hanson reports he is with
part of K pod off San Juan Island
.
*
We saw around
100 Pacific white-sided dolphins
today! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
A humpback whale
was feeding in the shallows off of
San Juan Island
! This animal went unidentified, we didn't recognize him/her, but it was a small individual, doing short dives and fluking repeatedly! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
