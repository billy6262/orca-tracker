============================================================

Entry 1:
Over by
San Juan Island
we caught up with
J pod
as we saw Blackberry (J27) and his family though there were other big males around as well. Then it was on to
a humpback whale
just further north! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

We put our kayak in at the boat ramp at
Eglon around
4:30
and this video was shot at about

5:00 p.m.
between Eglon and Whidbey Island. It was incredible! The [
humpback
] whale continued South, then came around behind us a bit and was
VERY close to the Eglon shore
. We didn't capture any more video as we were just trying to live the moment. That kayak paid for itself today! - Andrea Ogg

5:12pm -
I was with Connie and we had a heck of a treat! After the breach this [
humpback
] whale slapped his tail in a fury for at least 10 minutes straight! The wind was calm as were the seas...all we heard was the amazing sound of this tail ! Another great day! More pics to come...last we saw, she was headed east
towards Edmonds
. A blessed moment - no doubt! - Elyse Sollitto
