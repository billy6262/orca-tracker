Orca Sightings for September 1, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
When I saw this trio pop up together I had to do a double take. It was
Granny (J2), Mystery (L85), and Cali (K34)
. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu.

I don't remember exactly how long it has been since I last saw resident killer whales, but it had been at least 20 years. Today I made up for lost time;
we might have seen every southern resident whale
. There were whales all across the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
, from Vancouver Island to the Olympic Peninsula. We spent quality time with several dozen of them, and no other whale watching boat was in sight. - Photo by Bernardo Alps.

Southern Resident orcas in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. - Florian Graner.
*
Today we caught up with
members of all three resident pods off Sooke, BC
. In the lead were the
J14s along with L22, L94, and L113
. Mystery (L85) and Cali (K34) were having some fun. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
L85 Mystery
was an orphan at age 3, and was watched over by his brother
L38, 29 years old at the time
. He's now 23 years old. - Connie Bickerton.
*
My adopted whale
Scoter K25
. He still carries part of his satellite tag in his dorsal. Tagging is definitely controversial, but Scoter's tag lasted so long, he really helped provide a picture of K Pod travels after he was tagged in Dec 29, 2012. - Connie Bickerton.
*
Almost 40 killer whales at Point no Point in Canada near Sooke
today! - Sooke Coastal Explorations
*
In the
afternoon there were over 40 whales out together including members of J, K and L pod!
They were spread out through the Juan de Fuca strait and were acting very playful, seems like they were happy to be reunited. The
T's were getting very close
to the residents which is rare, in the past the two have given each other a wide birth. - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Transients
were encountered in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca near Becher Bay
. Individuals were ID'ed as
T034, T034A
, and some (but not all) members of the T037 matriline. Initially the whales were heading west with five to six respirations followed by a longer dive with a 3-4 minute downtime. Before we left them they had changed directions and were heading southeast towards Port Angeles, WA. - The Transient Killer Whale Research Project

We saw
two Orcas on the 330p ferry yesterday between Pt Townsend and Coupeville
! The ferry riders were thrilled! - Teri Butorac Ferren
*
So we had a very nice group of
Bigg's Killer Whales
that Ivan Reiff found in the morning known as the
T18s
. Easiest to spot in this group is a big male named
T19B
, affectionately known as "Mr. Floppy Fin". Morning trip he made a very quick and efficient kill of a harbor seal, and in the afternoon, made this beautiful spyhop near Bellingham Channel. - John Boyd.
*
Transient Sighting in Bellingham Channel
. We came upon what I believe to be
T18, T19, T19B, T19C
on the northwest side of
Cypress Island
. We were cruising along and realized there was a line-up of whale watching vessels looking right where we were! We moved out of the way just in time for them to come through. They seemed to be in travel mode and moved quite swiftly. They traveled north around Cypress and into Bellingham Channel
between Guemes and Cypress Islands
, heading towards Anacortes, before we parted ways with them. - Kamriell Welty
*
The
tranients at Race Rocks were identified as the T34's and T37 B's.
The whales were going for both seals and harbor porpoise so there was a ton of action going on! - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*

9:47 -
At
Norwegian Point
(by Hansville) now! - Elyse Sollitto
*

9:46 -
They are
heading North
. We just saw them. I think it's the transient group that were spotted yesterday. Amazing! - Tina Marohn
*

11:30 - We saw them across from Mutiny Sands
. - Sandy Pollard
*

11:30 -
Looks like maybe they have made a kill - lots of surface activity and splashing and hanging out in one spot.

11:16 -
Right by the midchannel marker
between Mutiny Bay and Skunk bay
They've moved a little south after that cargo ship passed.

11:09 -
Actually they're pretty stationary. Breaches, spyhops, tail slaps in one area.

11:05 -
Found them. We are at that point on the
south end of Mutiny bay
. Still heading north. - Rachel Haight
*

10:30 am
from Whidbey - saw
distant blows over on the Kitsap side
, still heading north. - Sandra Pollard
*
11 am -
Trending NW t
oward entrance to Hood Canal, coming up on Foulweather Bluff now.

9:48 -
Visual confirmation. I saw blows a mile or so north of Point No Point, trending NNW up Admiralty Inlet. - Howard Garrett
*

9:17 am -
Whales are at
point no point
right now! Do not know direction of travel. Presumably heading north. Coast guard just notified a mariner over marine radio. - Dianne Dee Iverson
