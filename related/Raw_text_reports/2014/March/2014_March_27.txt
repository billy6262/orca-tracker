Orca Sightings for March 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Salish Sea was sure alive today. The day started out with reports of
150 Pacific Whlte-Sided Dolphins in Haro Strait
. We left the dock and headed for the dolphins when I got a call from a crab boat with a report of
4-5 Orcas
. The crab boat captain is none other than our captain Lance Underwood who was working his other job. We decided to skip the dolphins and head for the orcas. By the time we got to the orca
there were 10 animals with a very new calf
. After watching them for a few minutes I started scanning for other Orcas and sure enough I saw many more blows about two miles from us.
We had two large groups totalling approximately 20 animals spread over two miles.
After spending time with the first group I turned around and couldn't believe it, there were
30 Pacific White-Sided Dolphins following the mammal eating Killer Whales.
They were very worked up and left the area very quickly after picking up the Orca.
The new calf is T065A5
and the
believed mother is T065A
who was born in 1986 and now has four offspring. We also got to see another new calf T049A4 who was first documented earlier this March. It so great to see the Bigg's Killer Whales and the Salish Sea thriving this spring!
