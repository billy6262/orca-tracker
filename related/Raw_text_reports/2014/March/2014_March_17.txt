Orca Sightings for March 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
SPOUTING NEWS - ST. PATRICK'S DAY GRAY VISIT For the 2nd straight year,
Mariners Cove
was treated to a
St.Paddy's Day Gray Whale
.This Springtime Gray visits Mariners' Cove each year. Maybe we should coin a nickname "Patrick" or "Pat". As is the typical pattern, Gray feeds on ghost shrimp close to shore and casually continues to
feed it's way southwest towards Polnell Pt. about 2 miles away.
Always a delight to report our springtime Skagit Bay-Saratoga Passage Tourists. - Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor

This was the largest group of
Pacific white-sided dolphins in Haro Strait
Captain Rush had ever seen, and the most playful. He said they zigzagged around the boat, rolling on their sides to get a good look at passengers before rapidly dispersing. Then, in a flash, they'd be back, or maybe it was new ones, taking turns to observe these big orange mammals bobbing in the surface world. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching
