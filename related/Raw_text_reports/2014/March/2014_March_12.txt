Orca Sightings for March 12, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just received a report from Kelly Clement from the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre Public Education Program Centre. She spoke to a local prawn fisherman that was checking his traps around

12:00 noon, and spotted two transients in the mouth of Bamfield Inlet
(Trevor Channel). One of the whales was quite small, possibly a calf or juvenile, and a female mother. Unfortunately there were no photographs of the animals and no one from BMSC saw them. - Posted by Josh McInnes

I got a call at

11:20PM this morning that four transients were spotted 1-2 miles off Sooke BC
traveling West. The group was said to be comprised of two adult females and two juveniles. I left from Pedder Bay and searched West to Sheringham Point with no luck. - Josh McInnes

Five orcas off Pt Arena CA about 6pm
. Confirmed one large male in the group stayed too far from shore for photos. Arrived from the south and stayed in the area. Were still there at sunset but offshore. So I did not see a direction of eventual travel. There were
numerous grays traveling through
. Orcas made no move toward the grays. Grays seemed unperturbed by killers. Also 10 orcas in Monterey Bay. - Scott Mercer

5 with one male off Pt Arena CA.
Can confirm only one male. Came in from offshore from the south. Charged around breaching and tail slapping. Broke into 2 and 3. Reformed twice. Still visible but offshore. - Scott Mercer

My husband and I spotted our first gray whale of the season from our deck at our home.
A single gray whale spouted just north of Camano Island head
, on the east side in Port Susan. So glad they have returned to our shores! - Vicki & Jim Mattson, Tulalip Shores, WA

12:16 - From Harborview Park in Everett
I can see
at least one gray whale
on the east side of hat island heading toward Everett. Movement is pretty inconsistent. - Sara Troyer
