7:40 AM - Orcas
sighted in Puget Sound. I was traveling from downtown
Seattle to Bainbridge on the ferry
when the orcas popped up on the starboard side of the boat. Whales swimming in a circular fashion, popping up for breath and immediately submerging again. 3 minimum. 2 males and 1 female (dorsal fins) Near the Seattle to Bainbridge ferry crossing in the middle of the route (~60-100 ft from ferry). Looked like feeding. The first 2 I saw were headed south (both male). Then 2 more popped up (one female one male) headed north and they continued in this manner with 1 or 2 popping up at a time and swimming circularly. There were also sea gulls at the surface of the water where the orcas were surfacing. - Shawnte Greenway
