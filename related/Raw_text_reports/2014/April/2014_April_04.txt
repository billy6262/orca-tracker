Orca Sightings for April 4, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I didn't see the whale, but Tradewinds Charters in
Depoe Bay Oregon
did. They had the whale on their Whale Watch Report on
April 4th. You might have already seen this, but I thought I'd send it anyway. Here's the report: Date: Friday,

Entry 2:
07:11 Current Report: Sometimes you get lucky on Gray whale cruises and see the Orca's at the same time. They are spectacular and thanks to one of our passengers who shared some of the pictures he took on the cruise.

5 pm -
Looks like they were headed towards salmon beach when we lost them and looks like NOAA turned back to head home. They might be headed to The Narrows (Tacoma). - Jill Clogston
*

4:30 - Saw orcas traveling south through the Narrows
. Were first sighted on the West side of the Narrows, South of Gig Harbor, close to the beach under the bluffs. They moved out into the center of the channel North of the Narrows Bridge, and crossed under the center of the main span of the Narrows Bridge. Last seen heading South, still in the main channel about 1 to 2 miles South of the bridge. One orca with a very tall dark dorsal fin and two smaller ones with short dorsal fins, lighter in color. Traveling South through the Narrows, South Sound. Although, as they moved out into the center of the channel North of the Narrows Bridge, they went underwater for a minute or two. The one with the very tall dorsal fin came to the surface about 100 to 200 feet further to the East, but rejoined the others in the middle of the channel before going under the bridge. - Warren Wilson

Woohoo!!!
At
11:30am there were at least 5 or 6 Orcas off the tip of Alki Point
this morning. How exciting! I've lived at Alki Point for 7 years and rarely leave the house without my binoculars in hopes of spotting whales. I'm so glad I had them this morning because this is the first time I've finally caught sight of them off Alki. One had a super tall fin that tipped over at the top. They swung around the point really close to shore, too! - Adrianna Wells
