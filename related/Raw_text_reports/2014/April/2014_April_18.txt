Orca Sightings for April 18, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
4 Orcas, including one juvenile, sighted along west shore of Admiralty Inlet
off Nodule Point (across Admiralty Inlet from Bush Point) Friday, between

4:30 and
5:30pm
. They appeared to be feeding (probably on salmon) rather than traveling, making frequent changes of direction and surfacing, then diving. They remained in the area between just south of East Beach Park and Nodule Point for over an hour moving southerly - a large passenger vessel (Safari Quest) shadowed them for an extended period. - Bruce Carlson

Talk about a surprise visit! Our
Oregon Coast Aquarium
scientific dive team was
offshore of Newport
today doing Sea Star Wasting Syndrome research when
a pod of orcas
stopped by for a visit! The behavior seen in this photo is called spy hopping. Oregon Coast Aquarium
Dave Ellifrit: I can ID L84, L47, and L92 in those pics.
*
L pod members were encountered off of Newport, Oregon
today!! Specifically, at least from the photos I saw, Crewser
L92, Nyssa L84, and possibly Nugget L55
. - Melisa Pinnow

What a day! Searching all over the Gulf Islands with not a whale to be seen and then, on the way home, we found the
T100's, 137's and 36A's in the Strait of Georgia
. They were hanging out right in the middle of the gulf moving west at 7 knots. My first Bigg's encounter of the year.....it's always so amazing to see them but especially in such a large group. They seemed to be mostly in travel mode but the two sprouters (
T137A and T100C)
broke off from the rest of the group and spent some time interacting, here is a shot of the two of them. It's incredible to see the the difference in T100C's fin from the first time I saw him in 2007 until now. His fin is starting to get quite large and looks like it's taking on a "T19B" shape. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

4:00 - They're now back at Dana Passage
.

2:17
"TWINS" IN
ELD INLET
(deep south Puget Sound) - heading south toward Flap Jack Point. I don't know if they can be seen from Frye Cove...but that's how far down they are. It is VERY shallow right now w/ such a low tide. They can't get much further into the inlet. - Kim Merriman

3:41 pm -
update on the
Olympic Peninsula orcas
from Steve Jeffries - there are
6 total
, including a calf and large adult male. They were 2 miles south of the south end of Marrowstone Island, on that side, so looks like they are trending northward

2:26 pm -
Brad Hanson of NOAA relayed a call from Steve Jeffries of WADFW of
a half-dozen orcas in Admiralty Inlet, north of Hood Canal
on the Olympic Peninsula side near Mats-Mats.
*
2 or 3 gray whales south of hat island
, heading north. I'll tell them to keep heading north for tomorrow's party. They will be VIP guests. - Danielle Doll
