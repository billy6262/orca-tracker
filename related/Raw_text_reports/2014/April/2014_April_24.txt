T049C and T077A
Transient Orcas. From the shores of
Edmonds to Mukilteo
, literally. These two Orcas nicknamed the twins (because they swim together, not related), made a kill just North of the Edmonds ferry lane then headed North to Mukilteo. I caught them just off of the beach at Marina Beach, then out from the pier, and then later on at Mukilteo Beach, again, just off of the shore. This started around
11-12pm in Edmonds
right off the shore then north of the Edmonds ferry lane, then about 2 hours later right off of Mukilteo beach. Looked like they made a kill at the 2nd stop, lots of activity and lots of birds trying to get scraps.

11:29 - 2 orcas close to shore off marina beach Edmonds
heading south (then north) moving fast. - Janine Harles

I have been waiting for
*
years

for a chance to check out this charismatic individual. He has remained on this elite, mythical level to me for a long time - this arguably legendary creature that others had seen, but I had only ever heard stories about. But today, after a long, tedious, nail-biting search, he surfaced and I can honestly say I erupted in goosebumps (and not just because I was being thoroughly soaked by wind-swept waves washing over the bow). It was him!...It was actually him...it was
CHAINSAW

12:07 - Solo big orca (T077A)
-- east side a mile north of
Edmonds terminal
. Close to shore heading north. More effective than four triple shot lattes to get my heart pumping!! Luckily I looked outside at the blustery weather blowing by this morning; I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this Orca's 6 foot tall fin arching out of the water heading north along the waterfront!! Made my day!! Taken today around noon - Edmonds Washington - with south Whidbey Island in the background. - Stu Davidson Photography

south bound a mile south of

, heading west. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
