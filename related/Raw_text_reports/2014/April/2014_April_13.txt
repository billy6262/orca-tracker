5 or 6 orcas
about mid-channel in the Puget Sound
west of Alki Point
. - Darryl Duke

7 pm -
Breaching
orcas off Bainbridge. 6-10
, breaching, spying, traveling in pod off Bainbridge. The weather and light last night were picture perfect with the Olympic foothills distinctly outlined in front of the snow covered peaks farther back. I made my way to the stern to enjoy the view and sun. Unexpectedly, I spotted a blow on the horizon, then another and then a breach followed by at least 35 similar splashes as we sailed towards Seattle. They were clearly visible all the way across Elliott Bay. There might have been porpoise among them. The splashes were so big and frequent that we were able to watch/see them for about 15 or 20 minutes from the ferry - their blows remained clearly visible almost all the way to Seattle due to favorable lighting and atmospheric conditions. It was a special treat; a good omen. - Gerard Wirz
