Lots of fog on the south end yesterday! The fog lifted to reveal

@
3am
this morning we awoke to loud blows echoing off the shoreline along
San Juan County park
. In the light if the moon we were able to spot
a few dorsals
cutting at a steady pass north. Hard to really see much though, leaving us with the sweet experience of just listening for over a half hour. - Susan Marie Andersson
