The two matriarchs
T99 and T36 were a solid 0.5-1NM apart from the their offspring (36Bs, 99C)
, being stealth whales in the currents off East Point. After a period of erratic surfacing and 4-6 minute dives, the two of them came together at the surface, and slowly began heading NW, taking short dives, almost like they were catching their breath. As if on cue, the other whales (36Bs and 99C) came porpoising (like, super duper porpoising, whole bodies out of the water) in a direct line toward T99 and T36. When they all met up they milled about for at least 30 minutes, not going anywhere really, pushing their kill around at the surface, lots of blood visible in the water. We later saw a pair of tiny fluke poking out of the water, indicating a harbour porpoise kill. Awesome behaviour to watch. If only we could hear how these two seemingly "called over" their kids for dinner. - Tasli Shaw
