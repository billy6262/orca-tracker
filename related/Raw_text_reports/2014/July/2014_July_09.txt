Orca Sightings for July 9, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:38 AM - Orca Show on East Point
. What a wonderful Orca viewing on Saturna Island. Thanks to the Saturna local call network for sharing the news that Orcas were on there way, lots of families on Saturna were able to witness this amazing show up close off East Point rocks. A pod of about 8-15 were traveling against the tide, jumping, tail slapping and a few seemed to stick around for some feeding. - Noel Martin

It was beautiful out by
Turn Point Lighthouse
, here's a photo of
K26 Lobo
with his kelp ribbon - it was still hanging there when we left the whales (members of all 3 pods) as they headed north. - Jill Hein

I noticed the
gray whale
sighting in your last whale report. Where was that sighting? It says Juan de Fuca Strait but has no other specifics. It is not uncommon for gray whales to be out in
Neah Bay
at this time of year, though peak numbers are later in the summer/early fall. Although we see mom calf pairs too, those are usually a little earlier at the end of migration or stragglers in June. We saw the same
mother calf pair
outside of Neah Bay. I recognized the mom as the whale in the photo in your posting (the posting says it is the calf but that is definitely the adult) - she is a female we have seen in past years and have biopsy sampled. Cool sighting! - Adrianne Akmajian, Marine Mammal Technician III, Makah Fisheries Management
