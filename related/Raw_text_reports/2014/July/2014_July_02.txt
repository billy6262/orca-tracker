Orca Sightings for July 2, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
orcas
were very spaced out, but we continued to motor north with them to
Turn Point on Stuart Island
. The group we were lucky enough to see were the
J-16s and the J-22s
. The J-16s are composed of Slick (J-16), Mike (J-26), Allki (J-36), and Echo (J-42). The J-22s are the famous "cookie clan", composed of Oreo (J-32), Doublestuff (J-34), Cookie (J-38), and Rhapsody (J-32). - Aimee, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris Whale Watching

It took
K Pod
a while to return to the
San Juan Island
, but they finally came home and surprised us all early morning! When I first got on scene around

11:00
I didn't know what was happening! There's so many dorsal fins- this isn't just one pod, I kept thinking. I started doing the math and narrowing down individual whales. It wasn't until I saw
K21, Cappuccino
, with his distinct dorsal fin and saddle that I finally made the call-
K Pod was definitely here
. The day Islanders, whale fanatics, naturalists, etc have been waiting for this spring- summer: our first super-pod of the year! Members of all three pods were intermingled throughout the strait up the west side. However, as they started to go north, they all entered into a resting pattern and split up into smaller family pods. When I left them later that day, K Pod was slowly swimming up Swanson's Channel. What an exciting day! Everyone in K Pod was accounted for, but no new calves. I can't wait to get back out there tomorrow ... - Heather MacIntyre

K POD IS BACK! Yesterday I zoomed out to the lighthouse because I had received word the orcas were moving north in that direction. When I scrambled out onto the rocks and looked south I could see blows everywhere. Some were a bit far out, there was lots of activity and some of the blows were way inshore! I thought to myself, "This is going to be good!" As the first group of orcas began to pass, this handsome fellow popped up. I had to re-check my camera screen to make sure I wasn't making a mistaken ID, but sure enough, it was
K26 Lobo! K POD IS HERE!
It was a steady parade of exuberant orcas for about 25 minutes and members of all three pods were present (we are still missing a couple of families in L pod - one of which has not made an appearance yet this summer). Really exciting stuff and I can't wait to see what today brings. - Katie Jones

Surprise, surprise -
Southern Residents seen from the Anacortes/Sidney ferry
! Excited passengers headed for the outer decks as the ferry slowed down around

4:20 pm in north Haro Strait/east of Sidney Island
, where Southern Residents frolicked, porpoised and spy-hopped among the white-caps. What an unexpected treat for everyone on yet another beautiful summer's day. - Sandra Pollard

J pod went north we heard with some of K and/or
L. Some members of K and L were headed south
along SJI
. We left them north of
False Bay about
7:15
. Very spread out with lots of foraging. And yes, choppy seas! - Rachel Haight

4:00 PM - 14-16
traveling E to W in choppy seas.
SW side of North Pender Island
. First group of 3-4 was approximately 200 yards out, second group (8-10) was parallel to our shore line about 50 yards out. Lost sight of the final group (3-4), 300 yds east of our location but they popped up in the kelp beds 10 yards from our deck. Moving quickly with long dives and only short breaks to fish and play.They popped up within 10 yards of our shoreline in the kelp beds. - Ken Plato
