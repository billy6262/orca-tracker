Orca Sightings for July 1, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I sat out and watched from Land Bank tonight as the
orcas went South past Land Bank
... Spread out up and down, as well as way far out to the middle of the straight. Center for Whale Research was out, and upon looking at my photos, Ken was onboard! So they were much closer then I, so I bet they know who was who having a little Hanky Panky.... Lots of rolling around... upside down... pectorals in the air... waving tails... I do believe I was blushing... should not have been watching! :-) - Cher Renke

today: a large dispersed
pod of orcas
traveling east-to-west past Flint Beach, at the

7 pm
, heading south into the inlet.
