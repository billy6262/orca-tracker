============================================================

Entry 1:

Salmon Bank
. - Mariann Carrasco
*
"Group A" of Jpod (J2, J14s, J19 + J41, J16s) with the K14s
off
Point Roberts almost all day
. One very notable missing whale from the group was L87, often seen pasted to J2's side, he was confirmed to be present off San Juan Island's west side with the rest of the Js and Ks. When we caught up with them
in the morning (
10:00)
they were spread over several NM, presumably foraging. Then they all grouped up and headed toward East Point, but turned around before they got to Boundary Pass and came back up toward the Fraser River. They spent several hours traveling slowly along with the flood tide, surfacing in large groups. Once they reached the T14 marker they seemed to "wake up," lots of tail and pec slapping then promptly spread and out and, presumably, went on the search for salmon entering the Fraser. - Tasli Shaw
