Entry 1:

. There were three whales at a distance feeding we think one was a small whale. One had a light swirl on its back. There was tail slapping and circling. A large Navy ship was going by at a high rate of speed and the whales were gone. Then suddenly they appeared next to our boat having gone a good distance to get there. - Vicky Turner
