Orca Sightings for July 8, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
After hearing the residents had headed out to sea in the morning, we were quite happy to hear there was a group of
Transients in Griffin Bay, in San Juan Channel
. Beautiful sunny day, and we had a lovely peaceful encounter with this group of T's.....one or two males, and a calf as well. Glassy smooth water, Mt. Baker sparkling in the distance, happy passengers. It's so much fun to talk with people from all over the world, and tell them about our wonderful whales. - Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.
