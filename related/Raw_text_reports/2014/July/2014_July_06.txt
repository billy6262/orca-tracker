A large resting group ... my absolute favourite way to see them (maybe after a large cuddle puddle ...). 20+ fins at the surface in synchrony, it is hard to explain the stirring nature of the sight. Cuddle puddle: what happens sometimes when the whales are in big groups and being very social tactile with one another. They will just hang out, barely going anywhere and just rolling over each other and rubbing up against each other. It's beautiful!!! - Tasli Shaw

L118 Jade breaches next to mama L55 Nugget this morning at Lime Kiln. - Monika Wieland

Anyone want to guess these ID's? 5 total...1 male, 1 young one... the rest looked female. Seen from Landbank 7/6 approximately

We were sitting there watching the orca when suddenly this
little Minke whale
popped up at very close range. - James Gresham

11:22 -
Maia of WA State Ferries reported
a minke whale near Pt. Caution
, San Juan Island (2-3 miles north of Friday Harbor).

Words can't really describe today's trip. I'm in my eighth season and this ranks as one of the best I've ever had. We chased a report of
whales up by Nanaimo
and was lucky enough to find them around
Thetis Island. The T124A's, T137's and T077A were heading south towards Crofton
. They stopped at a reef on the way and battered a seal around and then celebrated like CRAZY!! We have had a few encounters with the T137's when T137A breaks off the group and comes over to check out the boat and he did the same thing today except breached right behind us. Anyways....words can't say enough so here are some pictures. - Gary Sutton
