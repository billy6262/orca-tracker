Had the most amazing close pass at
Lime Kiln
this evening.
Scoter
and others literally flying out of the water as they headed south against the tide, launching their entire bodies out of the water. I put my camera down and just watched and listened. - Connie Bickerton

Well, the
T137's
were at it again today. We have really noticed the curiosity these animals have shown towards boats but nothing prepared us for today!! They started hunting a seal right when we got there and didn't stop for almost an hour. We watched from a distance for a while but as the hunt went on and the seal tired, the whales ventured closer to the boat. We backed up and tried to move away but they kept coming at us. We shut down and they would let go of the seal go so it could swim towards our boat and then just as it was getting close, they would come nail it!! We could hear the seal wheezing in exhaustion and desperately trying to get to us for safety. We had to let nature take it's course and stay out of the way but WOW, what an incredible sight! - Gary Sutton

2 pm - 10+ Pseudoorca or minke or pilot or Dall's in Dabob Bay between Pulali and Whitney Pts. Sorry I can't identify what we're seeing.
Just now, a "pod" of about 10 of something I've never seen in 63 years of observing from my home between Pulali and Whitney Pts on Dabob Bay. Leaping out of the water, probably feeding on runs of Pacific herring as were the white-sided. Too far out to get good pix with cell phones or video. Feeding avidly in clusters, leaping out of water almost completely, sometimes 4 in "formation," - this went on for about 45 minutes with maybe a quarter mile movement in front of our viewing spot here at our home. Pacific herring are running now. To me fins looked most like pilot whales, but can't find any sign they occur here. - Kirie Pedersen
Possibly White-sided dolphins?
