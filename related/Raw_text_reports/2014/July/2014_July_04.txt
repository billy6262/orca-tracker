Orca Sightings for July 4, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
One of the best Fourth of July's ever! Got to spend some time with
K Pod (along with some J's)
on the
west side of San Juan Island
. These guys were spread out intermittently, doing what they do best: fishing for Chinook Salmon! The Chinook Salmon is what these whales prefer to eat, they're actually rather picky. They eat about 200-400 lbs of it per day depending on the size of the whale. The Chinook is the biggest of the salmonids out here, and is very rich in omega-3 fats. The salmon smell their way from the Pacific ocean up to their natal stream-bed. There must finally be enough Chinook in this area for K Pod to make the roughly 80 mile swim into the Salish Sea from the Pacific Ocean. Who knows how long we'll have them here for, things aren't as they used to be with the salmon population, so I'll enjoy them while there here. Happy Fourth everyone. Feel free to share- for more information on the issues facing our salmon watch Salmon Confidential. - Heather MacIntyre K26, Lobo, born in 1993. This big guy was on the move fishing today. However, he made sure to exercise his curiosity and cruise past us ever so slowly, leaving us with all with a feeling of peace and wonder. - Heather MacIntyre

10:45 - K-Pod's back!
They returned on
July 2, but my first chance to see them was this morning. Here's K12 Sequim off of Lime Kiln.
J-Pod group A
went north early this morning, between 9 and
9:30 part of K-Pod made it up to Lime Kiln this morning, flipped and went back south. - Monika Wieland

Orca behavior/communication. As
J and K pods crossed Haro Strait
yesterday they were in quiet resting pattern, swimming slowly in tight groups. As they approached San Juan Island, K pod matriarch K 12 Sequim (pronounced Squim for those not in WA), stopped and began slapping her tail forcefully. The others responded by becoming more active and spreading out into a hunting pattern as they entered the area frequented by the Chinook salmon that they feed on. I love watching the behavioral intricasies.

2:44 - J and K pods. False Bay
area headed north towards Lime Kiln.

7:00 am. Whales on Lime Kiln!

J and K pods were intermingled
in quiet resting mode when we met them headed
across Haro Strait towards San Juan Island
. Identical scenario to last Saturday except last week it was J and L. Here K 26 Lobo on the left swims with a couple J girls. - James Gresham

9:10 - loud echolocation!

6:38am - Lime Kiln
started hearing faint
calls
over ship noise, now (
6:55) loud calls. Selena posted hearing them as early as
5:17am. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

7:23 a.m. PST - Faint calls on Lime Kiln Hydrophone.
- Kara E. Clayton

Gray Whale calf
. Apparently this
calf and its mother have been around between Lopez Island and Smith Island for a couple days
. Baby Grays are not something seen here. I'm sure they took a detour up Juan de Fuca Strait during the northward migration. Both the mother and calf were keeping a very low profile. Swimming just under the surface and barely showing themselves. The Transient Killer Whales in this area are not Gray Whale specialists and who knows if mom even knows about them. But to get this far the calf had to survive Monterey Bay Ca where it is a very different story. A very unexpected sighting. - James Gresham
