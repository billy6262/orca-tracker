Orca Sightings for July 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were in the ferry line in Friday Harbor to leave when I heard the
whales on the hydrophone at Lime Kiln
. We raced across the island and caught about
50 members of K and L pods
making their way north past Lime Kiln. They were so close to shore. An unbelievable experience! - Katie Snyder
*
A crazy day. Some Orcas went north, then south, but other Orcas continued north, while some continued south...Very unusual day! We started the day seeing
Orcas ten minutes off the dock at Snug Harbor Resort
and Marina and ended the day with Orcas, ten minutes from the dock at Snug Harbor. - Capt. Jim Maya

The "rogue"
L54 sub-group
finally decided to make their first appearance of the year in inland waters yesterday! I was surprised and thrilled to see them. Here's L54 Ino and L117 Keta, giving you a perspective of just how close these guys can come to the rocks at Lime Kiln. - Monika Wieland

Around

8:00 pm
my husband was out fishing about
two miles north of Kingston
near the shipping lanes and he spotted
5 orcas
traveling east towards the Possession Buoy. He observed them traveling in a group and watched them slap their tail flukes on the water and raise them up in the air as they dove down. - Linda Bartlett

Orca pod on south end of Whidbey Island.
I was out fishing at around

8:00pm
saw a pod of orcas on the south end of Whidbey Island. There were
at least 6 whales
, but there certainly could have been many more. It was awesome. They were swimming East towards Edmonds. There were a few minutes when they were jumping and whipping their tails. Nate Lord

Amazing encounter when
4-5 Transient Orcas
decided to swim east along the shoreline at
Point No Point
. I first spotted them 200-300 yrds out in the tidal current heading north, then they decided to head in to shore.
They came within 20ft of shore
and headed east back towards the point. When they rounded the point they headed off south east and seemed to go back into sneaky T mode. When I first started watching them, they appeared to be playing or hunting in the tidal current, moving in all directions. When they moved into shore, there were a couple of breaches, and lots of tail slaps. They were very active at the surface - no long dives. I also saw a couple of dorsal slaps, and upside down tail lobbing. They were not hunting. More likely post kill behavior. Dorsal slaps, upside down tails lobs, logging on the surface. It was pretty spectacular. Last saw them about
6:50 heading southeast back into the sound, and slipping back into sneaky T mode.

6:42 -
They are headed back south and trending east towards mid channel after a very close pass along the beach to the delighted observers. - Connie Bickerton
