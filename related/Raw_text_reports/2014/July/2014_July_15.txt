Orca Sightings for July 15, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
J37 Hy'Shqa and her son J49 T'ilem I'nges
as they scooted by the rocks
at the lighthouse
yesterday. I almost couldn't fit both of them in the frame they were so close! - Katie Jones
*
I was on the Clipper and was first to spot them on our boat after reading updates on FB. As we got closer to
Kingston
, I started looking for the fishing boat and then spotted
orcas in front of the boat
, probably 100 yards or more away from that boat. Stephanie was great at telling us her guesses of the whales' behavior and she was right! - Monica Zaborac
*
Thanks to everyone for posting reports below about what we think are a pod of
about 6 Transient orcas headed north up Puget Sound
. And thanks to Stephanie Raymond on the Victoria Clipper 3 for calling in a report of spotting
this group (1 male, 1 young one and 4 others) at
6:45 pm, just south of Point No Point
(N. Kitsap) headed north. - Orca Network

They went deep and, did not resurface as my sight line became hazy. I stayed until sunset! They were
headed north towards Admiralty Inlet, well past Useless Bay
.They went deep and, did not resurface as my sight line became hazy. I stayed until sunset!

My Friend [Bob Dale] & Me Saw
An Orca Pod Near The South East End Of Bainbridge Island
at approx.
3:15 PM - at Least 1/2 Mile Away - both feeding & playing the male breached a few times & we could see a couple of calves. We could see a large male, 2 calves & possible 2 females - they made our day worth while for sure. - Michael Porter
*
And more of an update from Jeff Hogan - now he believes
the number of orcas to be between 6 and 10, at
2:10 pm they were approaching the Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry
crossing, and seemed to be behaving more like Transients rather than Residents but they are still too far out to ID for sure.

1:43 -
They seem to be milling around quite a ways
west of Alki
. Heading up there now. - Trileigh Tucker

From my friend Scott out on
