============================================================

Entry 1:
Susan MacKay saw
J Pod Killer Whales heading South mid Georgia Strait passing Little River/Powell River
ferry line.
*
The
California Transients
from Saturday. I think this is
CA166 and CA173
. - Selena Rhodes Scofield
*
CA166
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca off Port Angeles
, WA. - James Gresham
*
A female swimming with
CA166
. The Cali T's were changing directions constantly. CA166 and the female with him were eastbound when we picked them up. Then they reversed and headed west. The others were heading southeast towards
Sequim
then reversed and had headed towards
Victoria
when we left them. - James Gresham
*
Some
California Killer Whales
were identified near
southern Vancouver Island, including CA166, CA172, and CA173
- by James Gresham. CA166 was first sighted in Monterey Bay in 1997. These three whales (and their associates) have been sighted off of southern Vancouver Island for the past four years in October: so very interesting! - Alisa Schulman-Janiger
