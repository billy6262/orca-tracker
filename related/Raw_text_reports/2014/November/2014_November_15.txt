Orca Sightings for November 15, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
So. Resident calls were heard on Lime Kiln hydrophones all evening until past midnight
.
*

6:15 pm - Very faint orca vocalizations
coming threw on the
lk hydro
, started to hear them at

6:15 p.m
. under the annoying rhythmic ticking sound. - Selena Rhodes Scofield

While visiting Ft. Ebey State Park on Whidbey Island today my partner and I observed
a group of Orca Whales
from the bluffs just
south of Pt. Partridge
. There were a minimum of 9, and possibly
as many as 20 Orcas
traveling north, spread out from 400 yards to 1 1/2 miles offshore. The time was between

3:50 and
4:15 p.m
. The whales appeared to be traveling with purpose. There were at least 3 large males (very tall central fin) and numerous medium sized and a few smaller individuals. We were able to observe 9 individuals either surfaced or spouting at one time. Clearly, there were numerous others as they appeared shortly after at other locations amidst the pod. Lighting was perfect with low angle sun backlighting the spouts. There were a couple of groups of 2 or 3 traveling close together with the rest of the individuals spaced more widely apart. One large male was closest to shore and the audible sound of his spouting was what initially drew our attention. Several of the whales passed very closely by the vessels (within 2-300 yards) without appearing to alter their course. - Dave Schmalz

3:20 - Squeaks, calls and whistles on the Port Townsend hydrophone!
- Susan Berta

A whale-a-palooza of an
afternoon
at
Ft. Casey! 30+ orcas
, along with a nice group of harbor porpoises and big old Steller Sea Lions...lovely to see my orca friends, with their backlit blows as they headed north past Pt. Townsend....makes my heart happy! - Bonnie Gretz
*
Whales everywhere, too many to count... Blows first seen
across Admiralty Inlet from Mutiny Sands
, Whidbey Island, at

10:30 am
on a crisp, bright morning turned into an unforgettable day on the water with the Southern Residents as they headed north out of Admiralty Inlet. Ken Balcomb, CWR was on scene as was Brad Hanson, NOAA, while we had our own expert, Howard Garrett, on board to photograph and ID foraging, porpoising, spy-hopping, breaching, tail-slapping, raspberry blowing (yes, really!) orcas in our midst. For the second day running we watched their blows disappear into the sunset, some turning west and others north, to meet up again who knows when, and where? - Sandra Pollard (Author of Puget Sound Whales for Sale)
*

2:00
- What a spectacular, cold but amazing day out on the water
off Bush Point
with
whales seemingly in every direction
. Although there were multiple breaches which I was lucky enough to see, I didn't capture any of them on camera -- but there was plenty of foraging, porpoising, spyhopping, tail lobs, fluke waving, and other wild activity! - Steve Smith
*
About
2:00 we saw spouting near
Marrowstone Island
- eastern side. We boated over and turned off the engine. Several orcas had already passed us by, but looking south there was pod after pod all headed north. I say pods - but I don't know.
groups of 5-10
. 2 jumped and turned belly upward. One group of 6 was diving and emerging all together over and over. Some seemed to swim by themselves. The sound of their breath all around was amazing. One came right at the boat and turned and passed us just a few feet from port side. We sat about 30 min, and when we left they were still coming in groups but now were more in the center of the channel. - Sally Gecas
