Orca Sightings for November 16, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:00 PM - Two to four orcas
, including
at least 1 male
seen directly west about 1/2 mile of parking lot at Devil's Kitchen SP,
Bandon, Oregon
. Unsure, at least 2, maybe 4, traveling. -Bill Bridgeland
*
Unidentified
orcas were seen heading north through Active Pass
this morning. There are chum hatcheries in Georgia Strait that may have produced fish that are returning down Johnstone Strait about now, so hopefully they're finding enough up there for a few days, but we expect a return trip to Puget Sound soon.
*
Fun (cold) day on the water today with
six different humpbacks
. Three pairs. Two south of
Race Rocks
, two between
Race Rocks and Victoria
, and two just offshore from
Victoria
. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

10:33pm -
My family and I saw what looked like just one orca not far off the shore in
Tacoma off Titlow beach
. Heard it blowing and saw the tail come out of the water. It was around
330pm
. Amazing! - Jennifer Curry Hahn
Possibly a humpback?
