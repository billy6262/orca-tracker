11:00 AM - Group of humpbacks sighted just off Clover Point, Victoria, BC.
On Sunday morning,
November 30, I saw a breaching humpback whale just about a kilometer off Clover Point, Victoria, BC (to the southwest). It was a sight to behold. The splash was like an explosion and I originally thought it was a speed boat that hit a wave too hard. Through my binoculars I could see more humpbacks coming up for air. They hung around for a few minutes and never saw them again. In total, I would guess there were 2-3 whales, but I can't be sure. -Andrew Patrick
