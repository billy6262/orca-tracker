Orca Sightings for November 6, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today at
~
12:05 pm I saw a humpback
(?) in front of our house (we live in a neighborhood above Shenanigan's in
Tacoma
) slapping it's fluke on the surface. It stayed in the same place for ~5 min. displaying this behavior, then a small white boat approached from the west. The boat stopped to observe from a distance. The whale then left the surface of the water and headed west - towards Point Defiance. Then it started to rain so hard I completely lost sight of it (& Puget Sound!) - Mollie Heilesen
