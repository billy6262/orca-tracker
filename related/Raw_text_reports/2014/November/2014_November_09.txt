============================================================

Entry 1:
Andrea Foster, naturalist interpreter at the
Heceta Head lighthouse
, Oregon, called with a report of at least
two and possibly one or two more orcas
, milling with no clear direction of travel, about 1/4 mile off shore. She said many sea lions were looking very nervous.
