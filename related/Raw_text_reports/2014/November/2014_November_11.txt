Orca Sightings for November 11, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mexico Coastal orcas - Rare killer whale sighting
off Tijuana. 12 Orcas
sighted at US border with Mexico - very rare. About a dozen Orcas appeared

Entry 2:
Playas
, right at the Mexican border with US, about 10 miles south of San Diego. This has "never happened before" - nobody ever saw an Orca here. There were
two groups of 4 to 7 Orcas each
which played separately about 50 yards/meters apart from each other, just outside the first surf break, within 100 yards from the beach itself. A surfer and some others reported that they "ate a dolphin" and described them holding it in their mouth and "throwing it about", which sounds typical behavior. I didn't see it, but the gulls and scavenger birds were swarming to feed on some leftovers of something, and there are or were plenty of dolphins here. The Orcas fed and played and trained their babies for about an hour then headed due west. This is out of your main geographic area of interest, but it was a fantastic show, and might mean some "change" in behavior. Air and water temp were both 69 degrees F, so 20.5 Centigrade, weather was overcast, tide about mid-tide, wave-face about 4 feet, with shallow sloping sandy beach.
A surfer in black wetsuit was in the water, and 3 large Orcas approached him in a semicircle to about 30 yards/meters and each in turn did a "spyhop"
maneuver, wherein they surface in a high vertical posture and hover high up for a few seconds - perhaps threatening? or perhaps just to look, or to announce their presence or claim territory, it was quite beautiful, and he got out quickly. Their colouring was less bright and high-contrast black&white colorful than Shamu, more camouflaged, not so instantly recognizable, with dark top, pale creamy grey accents, and pale tan saddle, very pale belly, and the unique big tail-flukes of an Orca, which gave them away from a distance. They were up to 15-20 feet long (5-6.5 meters) and sleeker more streamlined than Shamu, and had tiny babies. They made a wonderful show. 12 (approx) in two groups - 1 group of 6 or 7, and 1 group of at least 4. At least two had the high proud triangle of the adult male dorsal fin. Feeding, playing, teaching babies. Babies were very small like 1/4 to 1/3 the size of their mommy that they swam alongside. Each group, or at least 4 in each group swam in very very tight/very close formation. - Alan Williams
