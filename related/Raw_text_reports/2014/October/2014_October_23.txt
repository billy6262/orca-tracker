Orca Sightings for October 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
at least 12 different whales
! Peak
humpback
season is still in full swing as we approach the end of October. These guys are obviously finding some good feeding areas and filling up their stomachs before they head south. Humpback whales all over the world split their time between the high latitudes in the summer months (far north or south) and nearer the equator in the winter. They only feed while in the feeding grounds, so they need to eat as much as they can before they head for warmer, but nutrient poor waters. This amazing migration will begin any day now, and it won't be until July that we see these remarkable mammals again. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
