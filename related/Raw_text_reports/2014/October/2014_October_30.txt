Orca Sightings for October 30, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found
humpbacks! Three of them!
Now, that might not sound like a lot, but remember, humpbacks are not social whales. They don't travel in pods (that's a dolphin thing). They congregate in large numbers around their breeding grounds and in their feeding grounds, but that doesn't make them social. They don't travel with the same individuals for long periods; mothers and calves are rarely seen together after they're weaned! There were two big ones and one small one, so it was likely a mother and calf pair, and another one, apparently just hanging out. These guys appeared to be actively feeding as there were massive bait balls ALL OVER THE PLACE. Gulls and Common murres just going crazy over schools of bait fish, and humpbacks going right through the middle of it all. Quite the sight. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
