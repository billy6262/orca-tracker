10:25 am -
a small, single whale out front. Don't know what species. Looks like a smallish orca. It is NOT a minke, grey, humpback. Went south down
Eld Inlet at
9:30
to Flap Jack Point and then turned around at
10:00 and has now headed out north to Squaxin Island area. Flat calm. Could hear the blows, see the dorsal fin, and then the lingering footprint on the water. - Kim Merriman
