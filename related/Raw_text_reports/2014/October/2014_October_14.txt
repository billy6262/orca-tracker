Orca Sightings for October 14, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
T137A's and T36A's
were just
south east of Race Rocks
, probably the same group reported up Haro Strait in the morning. Then, just when we though it couldn't get any better
a humpback surfaces WITH THE TRANSIENTS!
- Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
*

5:30 - The [
humpback
] is still here! Just watched him circle from the
south end of Whidbey halfway to Mukilteo
and now back into Brown's bay. - Karsten McIntosh
*

4:24 pm -
I'm watching the
Humpback from Stamm Overlook Park in Edmonds
. It's just south east of Possession Point. Seems pointed towards Clinton. Josh Adams
*

8:40 am -
I spotted
a humpback whale
in the distance from the Victoria Clipper. It appeared to be heading North from
a few miles south of Possession Point
. It sounded after about 4 blows and I never relocated him. - Justine Buckmaster
*
We found
humpbacks
just
south of Victoria
, no less than
six whales!
all in the same vicinity to each other. Humpbacks are not social whales, so to see that many in the same area was a treat. Every direction you looked, there was a blow. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
*

2:40 PM - Humpback sighted off Possession Bar
(South end of Whidbey Island). Feeding-two to five breaths followed by a dive-would stay down 10-15 minutes between dives. - Chris Senyohl
*
One of
two humpbacks on the east tip of Waldron
this afternoon. - Robert Dash
