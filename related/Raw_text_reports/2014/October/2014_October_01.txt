Orca Sightings for October 1, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Humpbacks everywhere today!
5 Humpback whales, 10+ killer whales
, sea lions, seals, Dalls porpoise,
Pacific white sided dolphins
and huge bait balls getting picked off diving birds. The highlight was "Big Momma" and her calf going crazy in the Strait of Georgia. Double breaches and pec slaps and much more. They were really mellow and then all of a sudden.....double breaches, double pec slaps, throat slaps, tail slaps......MADNESS! It was so awesome. J pod kicking around too with some Lags. What a day full of wildlife! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

Saw
a single Humpback whale off Point No Point
on Wednesday between noon and
3 pm
. Was headed north when we left, but had been swimming around the area with no particular direction. Ninety nine percent sure it was a Humpback, although did not get a good look at any white patterning on the bottom of fluke. Even breached while we were watching! - Brenna Sowder

Around

9:00am - Humpback at East Point, Saturna Island

Wowzers! It's a party at
Lime Kiln
!!! orcasound.net. LIVE Killer Whales! I'm not sure if all of Jpod is in.. but it's J's with 3 Kpod members and L87 and that's how it's been for a week! Beautiful day on the water with J pod and L87! (There were some K pod animals around, but I didn't get to see them) This was the first time I've seen Pacific White-sided Dolphins bowride and harass a Killer Whale! - Traci Walter

Pacific White sided dolphins
came zooming in from behind!
L87
started zigging and zagging to ditch the pesky dolphins. - Traci Walter

Two-year-old little
J49
goes tearing off after
a few Pacific white-sided dolphins
(also known as lags). These little dolphins know they aren't in any danger flitting around with the resident orcas simply because resident orcas limit their diet to mainly salmon. However the orcas always seem to have an air of extreme annoyance about them whenever lags are around. The lags like to hum around the orcas and it must like having an obnoxious little mosquito buzzing tirelessly in your ear. There are many cases in the past few weeks where I have seen orcas do blatantly long dives to keep away from these little menacing creatures. Or they have exhibited over-zealous tail slaps. At times they almost seem to say, "THAT'S IT!!!" and go flying off chasing the little dolphins like J49 is doing here. Or perhaps he just found some playmates that are as busy as he is. I just find it interesting how much the orcas seem to have no patience for these critters when we as humans would happily play with them for hours. The difference between species... - Katie Jones
