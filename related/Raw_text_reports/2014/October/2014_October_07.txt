Orca Sightings for October 7, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
My hubby and I were out on the boat and saw
2 humpbacks
very briefly. They were a couple of miles south of
Point No Point
in the shipping lanes. They surfaced, spouted a few times, then dove one at a time, showing us their flukes. Then they disappeared into the fog and we didn't see them again. However, we did see many, many harbor porpoises feeding. One even leaped into the air with a fish in its mouth. A great day on the water! - Cassandra Miller

Morning reports had
a couple of humpback whales just south of Race Rocks
Ecological Reserve and eventually we were able to spot one, just southwest of Victoria! Up Haro Strait to
Moresby Island we found my two favourite humpbacks, side-by-side! The Splits! Split Fluke and Split Fin
, reunited at last! These guys were spotted hanging out together regularly last year, and seem to be in cahoots again! Both born in 2006, and both with fin anomalies that makes them easy to ID, Split Fluke and Split Fin are some of our more commonly seen humpbacks. Today they were travelling slowly south, doing short dives, and fluking beautifully in the late afternoon sunshine. It really was a sight to behold. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
