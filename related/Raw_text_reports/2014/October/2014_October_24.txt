2:54 -
Few spouts spotted on the Chelan about fifteen minutes outside of
Anacortes
! (in Rosario Strait) - Danielle Vance
*
Humpbacks just south of Victoria.
There was a pair travelling very quickly in no particular direction. They were a bit all over the place initially, and had the unusual habit of showing their flukes on the second breath and then not diving. While odd, this worked out great for us because we got twice as many looks at the flukes, which are everybody's favourite part of the humpback. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales
