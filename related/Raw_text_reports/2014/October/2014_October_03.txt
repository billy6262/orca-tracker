Orca Sightings for October 3, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Late afternoon I came across the
T049A's and T049B's
westbound off of
Otter Point
. They led us to a large group of
California T's (CA's), including CA166, CA172, and CA173
. They were mixed with T038A and other known T's who were eastbound near
Sheringham Point lighthouse
. The T049A's and T049B's turned around within a few metres of them and then led the entire group back to the east where we left them offshore of Sooke at 1700 hrs. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

5:30 pm -
We just received a report of a
large group of transient killer whales traveling East at Otter Point
(Canada) in Juan de Fuca Strait. Within this group were the
California transients CA166 and assumed companions CA172, CA173 and "unknown offspring." T065As
were also ID'd. We have been told
20+ animals in two groups
split by 400m. - Report Posted by Josh McInnes

A
humpback was traveling slowly, just south of Victoria
. The whale, I believe identified as BCY0769. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

Towards the opening of
Becher bay, were about 20 animals in the water
, moving so fast that their wake was more visible than the animals themselves.
Pacific white-sided dolphins
! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales

11:50 am -
received a call from Colter Mott, who saw
2 cetaceans surface north of Delano Pt
(Kim Merriman: Delano Camp and roads are in Lakebay, Wa. south of Penrose Point State Park and across from Carr Inlet, north of McNeil Island.) in south Puget Sound - larger and slower than porpoise, with dorsal fins not quite as large as orcas. He only saw them once and they did not resurface for him to get a better look.
Note: These are believed to be Pacific white-sided dolphins.
