Orca Sightings for January 24, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
T123's were feeding off Sooke
(about ten miles west of Victoria). Rush and I came across the T123's feeding off of Sooke in the afternoon. Just before spotting them we saw a group of harbor porpoise moving quickly west and a series of large slicks left in the water. The whales carried chunks of flesh around during our 25 minutes of observation. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
