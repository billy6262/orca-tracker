3 pm -
After cruising a lap around Holmes Harbor, we headed north and east around Baby Island and then south toward Fox Spit. Just
before passing Fox Spit we saw a lone Orca
emerge with an erect dorsal fin that seemed to have a broken tip. He was very large and he didn't come up enough to see any white on him. We slow to watch but keep our heading. Shortly after, once we passed Fox Spit, two more orcas emerged. These two were more lively, coming higher out of the water and blowing water over and over.
These orcas were swimming together about 1/4 mile behind the first, but in the same exact direction toward Baby Island
. They appeared to be traveling and unfazed in direction by our presence. They moved leisurely, but at a pace where they were out of site within 7 minutes or so. We didn't follow as we didn't want to scare them. - Travis Coursey
