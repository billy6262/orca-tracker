Orca Sightings for August 7, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:45pm - Several J pod members at Lime Kiln
today, including Blackberry, put on a long show with breaches, tail slaps, spy hop, and more. Breathtaking! - Kristina Louise Dahl
*
We started out with a long trip up to
East Point on Saturna Island
to catch up with the residents.
J's and K's
returned this morning and boogied
up Haro Strait.
They kept going and will probably spend the night in Vancouver. The "left overs," including K21 Cappuccino, stuck around southern San Juan instead of going north with the others. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Around
7pm - 4-5 orcas passed the mouth of Rolf Bay on Matia Island
, they frolicked all the way to Sucia before loosing sight of them. They were playing but traveling very fast. - Thomas Stanton
*

5:39am - Orcas
moving slowly northward passing
San Juan County Park
;
15 or more
closely together and a few more trailing behind. - Isabelle Martin
*
T34's, 37's and maybe the 99's today, Pea Pods in Rosario.
- Capt. Hobbes Buchanan.

2:00 PM -
5:30 PM -
Orcas south of
Pt Lawrence, Orcas Is
. 48 38 N, 122 45 W. 4 hours in Rosario St. We saw
7-12 (perhaps more) orcas
today, apparently fishing cooperatively, from ~
1:00 PM to 5 PM. Seen from south shore
Orcas Is, east of Doe Bay
. Whales first seen moving east towards Obstruction Pt from Pt Lawrence, in the channel north of the Peapod islands, sometimes coming in quite close to shore in Buoy Bay. Turned south along the east side of Obstruction Pt., headed south into the Rosario Strait, then turned back north towards South Peapod Is, fishing in the tidal lee of that island (east). Later moved east, in the channel south of the Peapods, but staying close to those rocks/islands, toward Lummi. Lost sight of them moving north around Pt. Lawrence. Many whale watching boats following along. Appeared to be fishing cooperatively, herding fish against rocky steep shorelines before feeding at the surface, or herding fish in the tidal lee of south Peadpod Is. Lots of apparently purposeful tail slapping (once, ~ 6 consecutive slaps by one animal "standing" on its head), some breaching. Incoming tide was flowing strongly. - Frank Peale
Note: These were identified as mammal-eating Transients/Bigg's whales, so they were probably hunting seals.
*
It's hard being a harbor porpoise! Scenes from today at the
north end of Haro Strait. T65As and T36As
. - Capt. Jim Maya.
*
7 transient killer whales (the T36A's and the T65A's
) attack a harbour porpoise in the most dramatic fashion. They threw it high in to the air, multiple times, all the while continuously breaching themselves! - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*

10:30 AM - There were 7-8 whales
in our sighting. One whale was significantly larger than the others and had a smaller whale who travelled continually beside it. The largest whale seemed to be leading the direction of the pod. Just off Epsom Point (30+ miles NW of Vancouver BC) heading northwest. They were initially feeding off the reef and then appeared to be playfully travelling together. - Regan Minchin.
