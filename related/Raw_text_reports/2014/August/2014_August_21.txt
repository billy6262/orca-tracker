Orca Sightings for August 21, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
K42, K14, and K36
. We headed south because we had reports of whales
near False Bay
. By the time we caught up with the whales they were past Lime Kiln on the west side of San Juan Island. We had a great afternoon watching K pod fully intact, and traveling close together. - Kevin Clumback, San Juan Safaris

7:00am, went out scouting, saw a few whales at Hannah Heights milling, then went north to Land Bank to see if any were north or southbound, didn't see any...headed back to Hannah and got a text from Connie about

7:15 calls on LK
(thank you) some loud so raced up there to see one off LK but didn't get handle on direction as I was driving. Down to LK no whales...saw
blows and spy hops south at Land Bank
....so they went south in the wind, fog and white cappy seas. Which whales I do not know but they are here and I met two more lovely women and a sweet dog name Uluru! - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Things started out spotting a close knit family of
K-pod traveling together off shore of San Juan Island
, the K13's; a family of 7 who often travel together in a very tight group. The family is made up of K13, her four children, and two grandchildren! The whales spent all day going up and down San Juan Island, accumulating whales as they went. As the day marched on the K14's showed up and then the K12's, until all of K pod was in attendance! - Jennifer Dickson

On

August 20th, Js and Ks were up north by the Fraser River all day
and
Ls were westbound out the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. By the end of the day, however, word was
Js and Ks were southwest bound from East Point
and at least some of the
Ls had flipped and were coming back east
. Curious to see where everyone would end up in the morning, I went out to
Lime Kiln early on
August 21st. Sure enough, around
7:00 a few whales came up from the south
, then flipped and went back. It turns out most of
K-Pod (at least the K12s, K13s, K14s
, though I think I saw K35 in there too) and maybe a few L-Pod whales were there. A friend told me she heard K-Pod on the hydrophones when they came down during the night, but Js must have turned back up north, as they were found off the Fraser River again. If Ls came back in, there were only a few of them, but I only saw them in poor lighting and wasn't able to confirm. This group did the westside shuffle all day - I saw them as they headed south from Land Bank around
4:15 PM. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

Witnessed a
white sided swimming with L's
again yesterday! - Thomas Cowan.
