Orca Sightings for August 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Sunset! We watched members of
K Pod and L Pod
for over an hour this evening. They were widely scattered over several miles. We saw at least ten whales at
South Beach
within a half mile of shore, heading slowly down the coast; one huge male breached twice, and they milled for a while. We backtracked to Lands End and watched more whales heading down the coast; these were close enough to hear blows and a lobtail! We saw a few breaches after sunset. Great end to our day! - Alisa Schulman-Janiger

We saw
a humpback and calf at Race Rocks
in intense fog, then the rest of J
pod came in with some Ks (K21, K16's)
later on. It was so nice to see the rest of J Pod again, and such a nice surprise. - Heather MacIntyre

Sightings off
Port Townsend. Same pod seen twice in day
, 6 hours apart, once from water and once from shore. 1 male, 2 females and one adolescent.
7 miles west of Point Wilson
at

14:00
. 200 yards off North Beach in Port Townsend at
20:10. At
14:00, small pod seemed to be traveling east towards opening of Puget Sound from the Strait. At
20:10, it seemed to be same small pod feeding/foraging along the shore of North Beach. A kite surfer in the area has an amazing story when pod surfaced 50 ft away. - Christina Cogan

We just received a call relaying a report of
an orca in Penn Cove
this evening at around

, called in by Sammye Kempbell who got the report from their neighbor. They are in the Captain Whidbey end of the cove, and the orca was traveling toward Coupeville.

Mom and calf Humpback Whale
today near Race Rocks! It was pretty intense watching them in fog that engulfed us all. You couldn't see much more than 200 yards away in any direction. Luckily, these two whales popped up after a long dive right next to Legacy. - Heather MacIntyre.

The
Pacific White Sided Dolphin
that has been hanging out in the south Puget Sound for a couple months was
in front of the Point Defiance Boathouse
for about half an hour this morning around 10a
m
. It did several jumps 8-10 feet in the air and was staying real close to the fishing boats. - Bryan Owens, Tacoma Wa.

Pacific White-Sided Dolphin
sighting! Took our little boat out around

8:15am
this morning and we were so fortunate to again see the dorsal fin of the white-sided dolphin thats been seen around here the past few days. He/she was about 15 yards in front of us and surfaced a few times before disappearing for the rest of our ride. Short as it was, always amazing! This was at the
south-east side of Maury/Vashon Island and Three Tree Point.
He\She was there in the same spot last Sunday afternoon, between Maury Island and Three Tree Point / Normandy Park. It was traveling - just saw the dorsal fin surface 2 or 3 times and then it was gone. - Jen LaGrutta
