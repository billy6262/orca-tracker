Best night ever watching Orcas. Hands down.
Transient superpod and Residents coming down at East Point
as well- in the sunset. I think I died and went to heaven!! Just pure magic. (
Later Heather posted the below rendition of the very rare experience of encountering large numbers of both Residents and Transient/Bigg's about five miles apart at the same time.

Transient Super Pod,

Entry 2:
Wow, the orca sightings this summer have just been off the chart!! Killer whales are one of the world's most widely distributed mammalian species; there's actually ten different ecotypes (differing in their genetics, morphology, pigmentation, social structure, and vocalistic traditions entirely). The differences between each are entirely based on the different survival strategies they have, which are necessitated by their choice of prey. Biggs Killer whales, also known as Transients, are one of the ten ecotypes found throughout the Salish Sea. They feed on marine mammals, and are very good at exploiting that prey resource. Usually they are found in small numbers, in groups of four- six. When you have a smaller pod, it's easier to ambush intelligent prey! However, we saw
25+ transients in the same area, a phenomena known as a superpod.
It's very rare to see a group of Transients this large. We also got to met up with the other ecotype found in these waters, the
Southern Residents, coming south from Point Roberts in the sunset
. These orcas feed on salmon. The two species are known as sympatric species, existing in the same geographic location, but not competing for food or resources. It was probably one of the best nights of my life. The serenity of it all was just magical. Enjoy the photos, and please share with your friends! - Heather MacIntyre

We were happy to have great weather and
20+ Killer Whales from "L" Pod eating Chinook Salmon near Sooke, B.C. Canada
. Thank you again Deanna Brett for some amazing photos! - Sooke Coastal Explorations

Watching a super pod of
30 Bigg's Killer Whales
in the gulf thinking that
J and K Pod
should be around too. Pick up the binos and started scanning BAM there they
are 5 miles to the west of us
. Over 70 Killer Whales less than 5 miles apart... Stellar evening!! - Simon Pidcock

8:15am -
we were camping at the
Spencer Spit (east side of Lopez Island)
walk-in campground yesterday morning, and we saw
four Orcas
traveling SSE out in the
Anacortes ferry channel
beyond Frost Island. The group included 3 adults and one younger animal. All three adults had dorsal fins of a similar height, but we didn't we didn't get a good look to see if any of them was a mature male before they went behind Frost Island. - Mark Wilson
*

9:00 AM -
We saw
two groups of whales
pass the south beach of
Decatur Head in between James Island
(where the San Juan Islands meet Georgia Strait). There were
about 8 - 10 total
. They headed north toward Thatcher Pass, and appeared to ge following a group of salmon. - Deb Wilson
*
At least
one humpback off of Point Colville near Davidson Rock
(SE tip of Lopez Island). Heading North at
1pm
Wednesday. - Elise Murphy

I think I saw
two humpbacks off West Point at Discovery Park
(north of Seattle) around

12:30pm
. - Isobel Alexander
*

9:10 AM -
Observed
a Humpback Whale
surfacing every 2-4 minutes, heading north due west of
West Point, Discovery Park
, while I was bird-watching. I took several photos with my 400mm lens, including one of the underside of the tail. - Joe Sweeney.
