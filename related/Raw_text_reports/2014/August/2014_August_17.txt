Orca Sightings for August 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:30 pm - A humpback
maybe 50-75 feet off shore from
Hannah Heights
. Only private boats nearby... all behaving very nicely, as far as I could tell. A couple kayaks too. Doing the usual 3-4 shallow, breathing surfaces... then 4th or 5th time down, it would go deep, flukes straight up. Within sight, I counted 6 fluke dives total. No breaches. My first San Juan Humpback sighting... Absolutely amazing!! I was a silly-giddy child again... "It's a HUMPBACK! It's a HUMPBACK!" - Cher - Friday Harbor

Ken Balcomb reports
J pod members off Monarch Head
at the south end of Georgia Strait and the north end of Boundary Pass, heading south about
6 pm
.

Great
afternoon in the Strait of Georgia with a very playful J pod!
It was one of the strangest fog days I've ever seen! Layers of fog were covering certain pockets of the water and the whales would wander in and out of it. The funny thing was that the fog was not very high off the water.
L87 Onyx and J26 Mike
's dorsal fins would just be peeking out of the top of the fog layer while much of everything else stayed hidden. At one point we saw a cartwheel...sort of. We could only see the tail fly above the marine layer. Very amusing, indeed... - Katie Jones

11:00 AM -
a handful of
orcas, 2-4
, seen off of
Point Wilson in Port Townsend
by a couple of our visitors at PTMSC. They were heading north into the strait. - Allison Kellum
*
We spotted this young orca off
Lopez Island
this
afternoon
, in a group of five - only one mature male present in that group - see the rakings on it's back? - Amitava Michael Kundu.
*
T065A's off Whidbey, Smith and Minor Islands
. This is a great group. The "Resident Transients." Incredibly skilled hunters. I hadn't seen them for a couple months. Little 6 month old T065A5 is looking great! On the hunt. One of the T065A's tail slaps a harbor porpoise into the air after a chunk of the porpoise's peduncle was bitten out, disabling it. After this, a whale does a half breach with the porpoise across it's back. Watching Transients hunt can be brutal but once you've seen enough hunts to understand the tactics they use and can disassociate yourself, they become a thing of beauty. - James Gresham

transient killer whales!
They made it all the way to Sequim! They made a kill at around
1pm

between Hansville and Foulweather Bluff, traveling NW at a pretty steady pace. Looks like at least a dozen, but we haven't had a good long look yet. Yay! Thanks to all who have posted all day - we don't have a recent update on the NW Whidbey Transient group, so let us know if you see them too! - Susan Berta

*
Bells Beach, Langley, 11am -
We saw
four orca
moving quickly toward Langley this morning. They were not playing, breeching, etc., just cruising. There was a boat "Destiny" that sighted them and followed quite a ways away, but a smaller boat ahead of Destiny, was much more aggressive in their chase and got closer than what looked legal...granted it hard to ascertain from the shore. What a treat for us, however! - Margaret (Peggy) Sullivan
*
11 am -
Barbara McCallem from
Bells Beach
just called reporting a pod of about
15 orcas
headed to langley right NOW! - Sharen Heath

About

10:00 to
10:15 AM - Orca in Saratoga Passage
. At least four Orca were a few hundred feet off the eastern shore of Whidbey Island, just
south of Fox Spit
(5 miles north of Langley). The Orca resumed heading south and toward the center of the Passage. 3+ Orca initially feeding, then traveling. - Steve Runo
