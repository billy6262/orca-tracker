Orca Sightings for August 16, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
What a CRAZY day! Captain Spencer and I were watching
L87, Onyx
(a Resident Orca) forage and noticed something small trailing him. We knew it was too small to be an orca, and sure enough it was a
Pacific White-Sided Dolphin
(also known by locals as a Lag). The Lag proceeded to pester him for about an hour! He tried everything, ignoring it, tail slapping, and eventually started porpoising out of the water- he was so over it! Unfortunately for him, the Lag was just having way to much fun! However, we were able to steal him away for a little quality bow riding time. - Heather MacIntyre

I heard what I presume was
J-Pod Group A on the Lime Kiln hydrophones from

3:00-
3:30
today. - Monika Wieland
*
One of the
T37s
checking to see if there are any seals on the beach at
Minor Island
yesterday. They are in luck... - Katie Jones.
*
It was a bad day to be a sea bird! Had one of the coolest encounters with Transient Orcas today!
37s and 34s
, plus another group that I am not sure of yet. Three or four juveniles kept attacking birds as if they were Sea Lions. - Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watch.
*
7 pm - T37's and T34's
were 1 mile south of SA buoy (about
two miles NW of Pt. Wilson, Port Townsend
) heading into Admiralty Inlet one hour ago. - Michael P Colahan
*
At least four (including a little one, perhaps the new Transient baby) have just a bit ago passed Bush Point
still heading southbound. They have not yet reached Windmill Point which is just north of Mutiny Bay, Admiralty Inlet. - Susan Wicklund and Marilyn Armbruster
*
7 pm -
I'm headed back to Seattle from Victoria and we just saw
a few orcas
. Brought some tears to my eyes...first time I've ever seen them in the wild Soooo amazing! This was one of my main reasons for moving up here. Still on the clipper. We saw them just
north of Port Townsend
. Couldn't tell which direction they were headed. It looked like they were playing or hunting. - Josh Harrison
*
2 pm ish - Orcas reported about an hour ago off Pt. Wilson
(near Port Townsend), heading south.
*

12:58 PM - 5 transient orcas
spotted traveling near Strait of Juan de Fuca (
2 miles NW of Ebey's Landing
, Whidbey Island). - Raymond Malstead
*

11:40 -
FYI for anyone not familiar....Tank Farm = Point Wells, Woodway (which is just north of Richmond Beach, Shoreline) transected from Connie's location means the
whale is mid Port Madison
a bit more east.

10:28 - HB
moved a bit north. Sightline from Richmond Beach out from Suquamish House. Circling. Deep dive. Even from afar is breathtaking, such a beautiful
whale
.

Spending the first day of my retirement watching a
