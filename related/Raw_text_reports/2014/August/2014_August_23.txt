J POD!! We saw
ALL of J Pod
today, along
Lime Kiln
, with James Mead Maya! Granny, Onyx and all of the gang were together for a while (first time in many weeks)
before splitting into A and B
, amongst much breaching and spyhopping. The water glassed out; absolutely amazing!! Carla Mitroff's first time for residents: wow! They were going north, then a bit south. Granny and L87 hanging in tight to Lime Kiln at the end, foraging behavior. Double-Stuff and Oreo just to the north of them. They started off a bit offshore. - Alisa Schulman-Janiger
*
It sounded like there weren't going to be any whales around today, but then the westbound
J-Pod turned around and came back in!
Here's J34 Doublestuf with another whale off Land Bank this evening. - Monika Wieland.

Whales and weddings...Late afternoon with part of
J pod at Lime Kiln
. The pod was very spread out and just a few whales went past the lighthouse, Granny being one. On her return south she passed within 5-10 feet of the rocks. I had just meandered up to the picnic table and missed being that close to her but was still impressive, what an amazing whale is she. And just as the wedding couple finished exhcanging vows up in the lighthouse two Humpbacks surfaced to the south and continued north. Ed and I also had the pleasure to finally meet the other Alisa... Alisa Schulman-Janiger and her buddy Carla Mitroff up from California with whom we shared this beautiful Sunday sunset. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Not only were the orcas a bit of a surprise on the
west side
last night, but there were
two humpbacks
out there too! - Monika Wieland.
*
Humpback
spotted o
ne and one half miles north/northwest of Point No Point
. I was motoring a 30' sailboat north through Admiralty Inlet when I spotted what I am fairly certain was
a lone humpback
. I first spotted it at
11:30 am, off Point No Point, and continued to observe it in the same one half mile square area for about 30 minutes as I passed through (I did not stop). The whale appeared to be feeding; it would surface and spout three to four times before arching it's back and showing it's flukes, apparently diving, staying down for five to ten minutes. It was not moving in any particular direction and seemed to have nearly completed a full half mile wide circle when I last observed it. It seemed vigorous and moved fast. From the closest observation distance of around 50 yards, I would estimate the size as around 30', give or take 5'. This combined with the large, clearly hooked dorsal fin and dark blue/black color leads me to believe it was a humpback and not a gray whale. I hope this information is helpful for your web site and I appreciate very much your keeping record of these sightings. - Colin Minch

4:10pm -
Some kind of
whale
passed by
Hansville
. Mid-channel. It blew several tall spouts of water and the only thing I saw was that it didn't have the tall dorsal fin of an Orca. Maybe that Humpback? Anybody else see anything? It was heading north. - Judy Anderson Roupe
