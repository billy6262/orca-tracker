Orca Sightings for August 30, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:30 AM -
Orca Sighting off
Port of Brookings, OR just off Chetco Point.
While out fishing off Port of Brookings
an Orca
surfaced about 10' off our boat. We were trolling for salmon (salmon derby) and out of nowhere he/she cruised by! Solid shiny dark steel gray/black, fin curved, estimate about 21' in length. Definitely
an Orca
; came up for breath while I assume was chasing salmon. Which by the way, salmon catch for the derby that day was WAY down this year. He/She swam out in the direction of where at least 50-75 boats were salmon fishing about 2.5 miles off shore Port of Brookings (section 17) and swimming out to sea slightly southward. We were about 2 miles off shore from Port of Brookings and north about .5 miles (Chetco Point)in 112' of water. This is second sighting w/in approx. a week. I phoned in 1st sighting. I assume feeding on Salmon or traveling. It was during the salmon derby and it (or they) swam out towards where all the boats were trolling for salmon. We were heading back in to Port but I saw it (or they) surface several times while swimming out towards the boats. I just don't know if it was the same one that surfaced by the boat or a different one each time. I never saw more than one surface at once though. - Jessica Wiltrout

2:00 PM - Saw about 4-5 transients in Welcome Pass off the Sunshine Coast, BC
, Canada. They were heading north along the coast. There was at least one large male and maybe an adolescent. They were breaching and also doing many tail flops!! - Laura Wenn

Orcas at
10:48 am to
11:25 just off Lime Kiln
, west side of San Juan Island, coming from south, but turned back south. - Sherrie Stahl.

Ken Balcomb reports some
combination of J and K pods were off False Bay
this
afternoon
.
*

3:46 - 7 orca pod going south Trincomali Channel
near Active Pass. - Roland Flutet
*
Quick but close encounter between
Saltspring Island and Prevost Island
.
The pod
headed straight towards us, and we just had time to turn the engine off that they were upon us - or rather, under us! Apparently
7 different orcas
in that pod heading north east and then turning south east in the
Trincomali channel
, most likely towards Active Pass (at that time, the tide was heading out to the Strait of Georgia, making it an easy crossing). - Ro Land
*
A
humpback
popped up right in the middle of
a group of orcas
on Matt's

4:30
trip! Very unusual behavior for the two species to be so close to one another, but we didn't mind! - Alanna Brennan, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Ken Balcomb reports
two humpbacks off the south end of San Juan Island
, and
two humpbacks were also seen in Porlier Pass
in the Canadian Gulf Islands.
