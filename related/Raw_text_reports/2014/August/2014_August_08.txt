going on off the
Lime Kiln Point hydrophone
. - Devin Scott Doss

4pm-ish -
My wife and and I spotted
a pod of we think 4-6
from our boat, just off o
f San Juan Island at Bellevue Point
. They were heading south. 4 were forward of us about ¼ mile between us and the shore. I would estimate these 4 were about ½ mile off shore. We were stopped and taking in the sights when no sooner did we hear the unmistakable sound of blowholes astern of us and sure enough, two more orca were only 100 yards away By the time we were out of the shock of this sight, we did get an iphone picture of one of the orca, however, it is grainy at best. Just incredible! - Tom Bartolomei

Humpback whales near Discovery Bay
. We saw a blow and a single hump near the mouth of Discovery Bay. The pattern of the blows suggested perhaps a couple of whales traveling NNE. We think, based on the hump and blow, that they were humpbacks but we saw them from too great a distance to be sure. - Rick Floyd
