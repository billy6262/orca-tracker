Orca Sightings for August 15, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
T041A2
has survived that first critical year so its safe to designate it with the name Tree after Tree Island where it was likely born. Next step is to get an image of the calf breaching and showing it's belly so we can see if if it's a he/she. Her
mom T041A
is easily distinguished by her 2 notches but not to be confused with the similar fin to Wakana (T011). The mom and calf were alone when John was with them and we don't know if she returned to her matrilineal gang and if she didn't then she will likely be with another gang as she would be challenged to provide food if she just travelled on her own. If they are spotted, It would be great to get images to us right away. - Rod Palm, Strawberry Isle Marine Research Station, Tofino BC. - Howard Tom.

I thought maybe someone with knowledge would report the
large strung-out group of orcas off Ediz Hook Port Angeles
on Friday,
August 15 at about
2pm
. We were returning from a fruitless fishing trip out of PA when we encountered the group of maybe 20 orcas. The water was too rough to attempt a photo. Based on this information, and the reported locations of other orcas that day, would you think these are residents of transients? - Sherry Anderson, Sequim
Note: The only other report near there that day was of "Group A" of J pod in Haro Strait, which could look like about 20 orcas.
*
Resident killer whales in Haro Strait! L87, J39, J49
, and several other members of J-pod who have been seen in the area recently. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

7:19 am - Three or more orcas
were just now very close in and near to the
Vashon ferry terminal
and are heading west. - Barbara Weber
*
We saw Split Fin! He was taking a snooze, so after a few surfaces we decided to keep moving and keep looking... And we found
5 more humpbacks!
But the highlight was a mother and calf pair. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Spotted
a humpback whale about 740am
this morning about 3-400 yards off of NE tip of
Bainbridge Island
. It has been cruising back and forth for the past hour just offshore. Very foggy but did get some decent pics. - Tim Cuddy
