Orca Sightings for August 6, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
T30's and a BC Ferry with Saltspring Island, BC
in the background. - Traci Walter.

No residents around the last two days but we've been lucky enough to find transient killer whales yesterday and today AND they were two different groups. Yesterday was the
T18's
whereas the group that showed up today was the
T30's
. Skipper Mark Malleson spotted these guys before he was even on the water. Mark spotted killer whales in Oak Bay, while eating breakfast, from his house! The T30's travelled steadily north and by the later afternoon they were too far away for us. They probably continued up and will head towards Vancouver. - Jennifer Dickson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

12:30 pm, off North Bluff, Greenbank, Saratoga Passage

I saw
several blows
between the
Mukilteo ferry lane and Everett
while I was on the
5:05 crossing this morning. It seemed to be just one whale. - -Sharon Harper-Peck
