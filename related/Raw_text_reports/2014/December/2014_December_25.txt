4:00 PM -
A wonderful christmas gift. We spotted
5 orcas between the south end of Salt Spring Island and Pat Bay
(Canadian Gulf Islands). They must have been feeding. Lots of activity. We watched them for a good hour. After talking with other people they were in the area for at least 4 hours. Appeared to be feeding. Spyhops, jumping out of water. -Karen Gray

Santa brought me what I asked for,
Orcas in Penn Cove
! My first sighting there in the 3 years I've lived on the Cove!
Transients
....possibly some hunting behavior, changing direction, moving fast, then slow, birds following, then headed out to Saratoga Passage. One male had sort of a tipped forward dorsal fin.
5-7 in the group
. Yeah, Whales!!!! -Bonnie Gretz
Mark Malleson: Looks like T046's. T046E (the male, born in 2003) is getting big!
