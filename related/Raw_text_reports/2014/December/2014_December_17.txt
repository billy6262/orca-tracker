Orca Sightings for December 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas at Anderson!
WARNING: inappropriate words are used (the s-word) we are sorry but we were scared. My buddies and I were crabbing off of the
west coast of Anderson Island
and even though we didn't really catch anything, we got to see the
pod of orcas
everyone has been talking about! We were in a little aluminum rowboat and we think that the sound of the rope being pulled along the side of the boat is what attracted the babies because right after we pulled up the pot the pod headed right for us. Most of the fun from this video comes from how scared we (really just me) were so some profanity is used. However feel free to laugh at how I respond to a scary situation like this (I yell run even though we are in a rowboat) and enjoy the beautiful orcas at the beautiful Anderson Island!

Had a great view of the
SRKW about
2:15 off the beach at PNP
. Thanks for the heads up Orcanetwork and Center for Whale Research! Saw some stunning breaches, whales completely porpoising out of the water and a major adrenaline rush as they swam by and tail lobbed and seemed to change direction a few times as if foraging! My photos are blurry ...oh my eyes! I must share it was a most wonderful sight to see them again down here. I hope mother earth can feed them down here. Many blessings to our friends on the shores. I feel so much happier after todays encounter. -Elyse Margaret

I chatted with 3 gentleman who had encountered them while pulling crab traps in a rowboat off the west side of the island. They had
a video of an orca bumping the boat
, swimming past/under them twice while turning and looking at them. It was quite the close encounter! I will try to connect them to Kim, since it would be a great video for identity confirmation, but it sounds like it was the T137s. -Belen Bilgic Schneider, Anderson Islanders

From KIRO TV: Wednesday morning two scuba divers shot video of
a gray whale in the South Sound
. They spotted it just feet off the shore of
Redondo Beach
(between Federal Way and Des Moines, southern Puget Sound).
It is not unusual for Gray whales to be seen in Puget Sound during the Gray whale migration seasons. We often hear about wandering Gray whales who don't know where the food is (unlike the 10 - 12 Northern Puget Sound Gray whales that arrive to Whidbey Island and Possession Sound each spring to feast on ghost shrimp). These wandering Grays are typically whales who are not in good health, and often end up dying somewhere in Puget Sound.
