Orca Sightings for December 10, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Killer whales at Bush Point.
This is a few days late but wanted to report the sighting anyway. I had just seen a harbor seal and they surfaced exactly where he was. They did not appear to be hunting though. Two females traveled east along the beach to the white rock and then turned northwest towards Lagoon Point and I lost sight if them. It was a pretty stormy morning with a high tide, the water was rough and quite off colored. I fish this area a lot and was quite suprised to see them so close to shore. Amazing. -Ian Patterson
