Orca Sightings for December 3, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a post from

8:30 this morning
on Tweeters birding list that
Orca were spotted in Edmonds
this morning. I emailed the person that posted asking about direction of travel.
from Jeremy at Tweeters: "For anyone interested, there are three or four Orcas just off the pier. It's been entertaining swiveling between Snowy Owl and whale views. They were heading north from Edmonds up towards Mukilteo. I lost sight of them as they were passing east of Possession Point (Whidbey Island)." -Connie Bickerton
