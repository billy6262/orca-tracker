Orca Sightings for December 20, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
*
It was a very interesting
audio encounter
last night.
Port Townsend HPs and repetitive call
. It began at least at

5:30pm
and possibly before - a repetitive call. The repetitive call came in 'groups' - several, spaced out, and then nothing and then repeated again. The repetitive call and then finally distant J pod calls - which were less often - continued for hours. At one point I thought I might have heard a
K Pod call or two
but I couldn't be sure.
The rest I believe were J Pod
. But who knows who the 'caller' was and what, if any, significance did that call have. At

9:14pm the last sequence of repetitive calls occurred
. After that there were more J pod calls in the distance and the loudest, though still not loud,
J Pod calls came at
10:52pm
. There were just a couple. I didn't hear anything after that. I posted clips of the repetitive call to my blog. -Jeanne Hyde, Blog: Whale of A Purpose
