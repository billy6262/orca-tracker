Orca Sightings for December 23, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
In
Harney Channel between Orcas and Shaw
, I was on the ferry home and we saw
orcas
. I thought the ferries probably reported these sightings. It was dusk when they announced there were orcas up ahead. I saw a female and a little one, port side,
as we pulled into Shaw
. Others saw what they thought were 2 females and a baby. It was a little after 5 and I could barely see. Thought maybe there was a young transient I hadn't heard of. -Susan Oseth

Our friends that own the
Marina, Fair Harbor
, said their were
Orcas
down here last Tuesday morning. They were across from us at Rocky Bay and then went north toward Allyn (
north end of Case Inlet
) and then back again, and headed out around
Anderson Island
. There were 5ish smaller ones and another set of a large and small. -Margot Ladd
