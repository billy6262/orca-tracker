Orca Sightings for December 12, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw a bunch of splashing near
Nisqually Reach
. Turns out it was
Orcas "playing" with some poor seabird
. They kept jumping on it and hitting it with their flippers. These guys were not hungry. There were 15-20 stellar sea lions in the area that they totally ignored. They were doing this for fun. They would eat him and spit him out over and over. The bird lived though. Then one came up from out of nowhere and jumped out of the water right in front of me. Scared the crap out of me. Engine was off luckily. - Travis Harris

11:05 am - J pod heading west past Clover Point
, east Victoria, reported by Brett of Eaglewing Tours to Josh McInnes

J Pod calls over the Lime Kiln hydrophones from
2:48 a.m.
lasting for about 30 minutes. -Jeanne Hyde

1:24
update. They are still
heading slowly north toward Boston Harbor
- more spread out than when they headed into
Budd Inlet
. Gorgeous day. Sea Lions are hiding on the Eld Inlet side of Cooper Point spit. -Kim Merriman
*

1:00 -
They are
heading north again from Burfoot, out of Budd Inlet
. -Gayle Swigart
*

12:07 -
South South orcas are
moving slowly south into Budd Inlet (near Olympia)
. They are in Gull Harbor - which is south of Boston Harbor. I have lost sight because they have gone past the tip of Cooper Point which blocks my view. -Kim Merriman
*

4:08 -
They have headed north very slowly. They were headed toward
Dana Passage and Harstene Island
. They weren't in a hurry. They rejoined together and cartwheeled, head stand, spy hopped, breached their way all the time as they headed "out" of Budd Inlet. I have now lost track of them. There will be some photos coming. GORGEOUS day.

3:00
update. Still in the
Budd/Eld inlet
body of water...straight in front of me and in front of Boston Harbor (opposite shores). Very active. Lots of tail slaps and breaching - sometimes all at the same time. Split into smaller groups of two or three and have spread out. Not much wind so you can hear every blow! -Kim Merriman
*
Three humpbacks moving fast into Juan de Fuca Strait
. -Josh McInnes
