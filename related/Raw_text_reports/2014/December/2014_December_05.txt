They must be hunting/foraging. It's getting harder to keep track of them. Still approaching
Fay Bainbridge
but much closer to that side of the channel now. I'm always grateful for the opportunity to see whales but I'm especially grateful today! Thanks everybody!

My dad just called to tell me he has a pod right in front of his house on
Eglon Beach
, outside of Kingston, heading south! He said they are so far in it would be dry beach with the tide out. Wish I had pics. Awesome. -Katlin Jones Lee
