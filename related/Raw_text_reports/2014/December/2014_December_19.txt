Orca Sightings for December 19, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:50AM -
12:20PM - 6-7 Orca
just north of
West Bay Marina in Budd Inlet
. One very large, one very small, the rest of varying medium size. One very large dorsal fin. When first sighted and for the next several minutes they seem to be frolicking/playing. I didn't notice any feeding activity even though they were close to log booms holding harbor seals. Photos posted here: https://picasaweb.google.com/clamalot/OrcaPlay. -Mike Woodall
