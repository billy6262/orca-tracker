May 22 & 28
I was recently catching up on some e-mails and came across the Orca Network report [with the gray whale photographed
May 22 by Stu Davidson and Janine Harles off Edmonds]. I couldn't help but recognize the little grey whale that was photographed in Puget Sound on
May 22nd as the same individual that
I photographed on
May 28th off northeast Vancouver Island
while out doing some work with MERS. The pigment on the right side of the head and the left flank match up nicely. Anyway, it was so covered in KW teeth rakes scars that we decided to Facebook an image of it. Thought you all might be interested. - Jared Towers
