Orca Sightings for May 12, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients in Dungeness Bay
. Lat/Long: 48.177305/-123.106613. I'm a volunteer lighthouse keeper at the New Dungeness Lighthouse on the spit at
Sequim
. There are
several orcas in the bay
, unfortunately being harassed by a sailboat who is chasing the pod around the bay as they try to feed on the abundant seal population here. I'm having trouble getting a clear count, with the sailboat constantly breaking up the pod, but there appears to be at least
4 adults and one youngster
. Initially they were feeding with some playing (tail lobs, juvenile spy-hopping). Once the boat began harassing them, they seemed to primarily be trying to avoid the boat, essentially until the boat chased them out of the bay. - Sarah Miller

Mark Lee called in a report of
5-6 orcas

heading NE at
9:30 am near Bachelor Rock off Port Angeles
, just 50 yards from the bluff.
