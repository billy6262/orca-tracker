Orca Sightings for May 17, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
A large
humpback whale
graced us with its presence on the
American side of the Juan de Fuca Strait
. Captain Scott aboard the Ocean Magic II believed that the large male was "Split Fin", who was travelling solo just
2 nautical miles off Crescent Bay
. He noted that when they shut the engines off completely, they could hear the whale breathing as it slowly surfaced time and again! - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
