Orca Sightings for May 31, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales everywhere today!! We started off with part of
J pod near Pender Island
....it was so nice to see those familiar fins again. I hope there is lots of food for them and they hang around a while. They were cruising up boundary when we got the report of the
T65As in the Strait of Georgia
so we headed out to them.......they are starting to feel like residents!! T65A5 was being a little superstar as usual. THEN....we got a report of
Humpbacks near Thrasher rock
so we went up there are found "
Big Momma
" with a new calf!!! They were slowly heading west up towards Entrance Island. WHAT A DAY!!! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

J Pod
has 25 members. They split up into groups and were spread out for miles. Capt Carl chose to spend quality time with one group rather than trying to catch all of them. We were with the
J22 matriline consisting of J22 Oreo, J34 Doublestuf (the big male), J38 Cookie and J32 Rhapsody
who swims with them. I have a very different experience with Residents vs Transients. The Residents are so desperately endangered that they really tug at me and I find tears in my eyes every time I see them. Today was no different. - James Gresham

OH MY GOSH! I am going through some of my J Pod photos from the Lighthouse early this morning. I have
so many shots of orcas with salmon in their mouths!
I had no idea until getting them on the computer! WOW! All I care about is that they are getting enough to eat. Apparently there was something out there this morning! - Katie Jones

was super, super spread out. At

I saw the
J16s from Lime Kiln
. Out with Maya's Westside Whale Charters later in the morning we met up with the
J14s, J19s, J2, and L87
near Turn Point. Sure is good to have them "home"! - Monika Wieland
