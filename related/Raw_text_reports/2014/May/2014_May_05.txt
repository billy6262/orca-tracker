Orca Sightings for May 5, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
First joint report from Gary and Tasli! What a day!! A
huge group of T's
reported early in the morning in
Sansum Narrows
so off we went to find them. We caught up with them around
Crofton
and they were really moving! 8 knots against the tide. We had the
T90's, T100's (minus the 100B's
),
T101's, T124's and T87
. They slowed down for a while near
Kuper island
(northern Gulf Islands) and did some spy hopping and then continued moving up towards Thetis Island. We hadn't seen
T101C
for most of the trip and was starting to get worried but then, out of nowhere, there he was with
T124E
porpoising right passed our boat to catch up with the others! We have attached some pictures. The first one is
T124E
porpoising by the boat and the other is
T101C
following suit (Photos by Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver). The next shot is a spy hop from
T101
and I've sent another photo in a separate email with the two brothers,
T101B and T102
because the files are too big for one email (Photos by Tasli Shaw, Steveston Seabreeze Adventures). - Gary Sutton & Tasli Shaw

Today a "superpod" of Ts!
T90s, T100s (minus 100Bs), T101s, T124s, and T87
. A real treat to watch whales in the northern Gulf Islands. Always one of the highlights of my season. - Tasli Shaw

There were approx
17 Biggs orca
at the Duke point ferry terminal (
Nanaimo
) on the east side by Mudge. There were 2 bulls calves and cows. This was on monday at

5:30
. - Shannon Carifelle

I was able to find a large group of
T's at the mouth of Cowichan Bay
in the morning thanks to a report from Simon of Ecoventures.
T100C in Sansum Narrows
. They went north into
Sansum Narrows
where they met up with a south bound group. They eventually turned back north. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

Mark and Rush booted it up to
Sansun Narrows
where a couple groups of
transient killer whales
had been reported. What they found was spectacular.
Two groups of killer whales
, joined together zig-zagging through the channel, initially going south, switched direction and travelled north along Saltspring Island. Mark said they were breaching and conducting lots of surface behaviours, even vocalizing at the surface! - Prince of Whales Whale Watching

Patch (#49)
made an appearance east of
Hat Island at
12:25 pm
, while at 1
:10 pm #723
had passengers on Mystic Sea holding their breath as he traversed the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry dock in sight of the approaching ferry... All passengers gave a sigh of relief when #723 surfaced before waving farewell with his flukes and heading towards Possession Point. - Sandra Pollard, Naturalist on Mystic Sea.
