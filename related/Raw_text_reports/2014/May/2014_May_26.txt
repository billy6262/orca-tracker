Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb spotted
11 T's from shore inside Secretary island in the afternoon

T049A's, T065A's, T051 and T091
. - Mark Malleson

T124A
sporting some shiny new gouges around her eye! - Andy Scheffler

The perils of hunting food that fights back. Either
TO124A or TO90 off Moresby Island BC
Saturday. If you open it large you can see a strip of skin has been peeled back and is hanging over her eye. - James Gresham

BC Ferries reported that there was
a group of whales right in the middle of Active Pass, 5 transient orcas
! The group were later identified as
T124A's and T90's

We saw
4 or 5 whales go by our place at Otter Point just after
1:30
today. - Sharon Orr

(Previously reported as a humpback until looking at the photos) So exciting, about

7:30 -
8:30 Chito Beach Resort
(just east of Shipwreck Point, about 15 miles east of Neah Bay) got our first sighting of a [
gray whale
]. Stayed right in front of the resort for about an hour. Rolling around, tail up flukes up, bubbles rising. - Amy Cramer
