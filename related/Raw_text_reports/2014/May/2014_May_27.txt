Orca Sightings for May 27, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had the
T049A's and the T065A's in the morning
on
Hein Bank
followed by
T097 and T093
. They all ended up going north up
Haro Strait
. The T049A's and T065A's followed close to the shoreline while T093 and T097 lagged behind and offshore. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Two new transient orcas
were reported in Canadian waters
near Darcy Island
. Once on scene, our transient expert Mark was able to identify them as
T93 and T97
, a pair of males who are often seen traveling as a pair. The trips had time to return to the original
group of 12 transients
! Our afternoon was with the two "twin" males near Sidney and the larger group still traveling north towards Turn Point. The larger group, although difficult to identify exactly which individuals were there, were believed to be 3 different families together. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
Great day out on the water today! Spent the day watching
three groups of transients off San Juan Island/ Salmon Bank
. I was able to ID the
T049As, T065As, T093, and T097
. Lots of high speed porpoising. T051, T049A2, and T049A1 off Discovery Island. - Josh McInnes Transients T049As, T065As, T093 and T097.

Encounter Summary: Dave Ellifrit was on the mainland running errands when Ken Balcomb called him from Sooke to report that Ivan Reiff had spotted transients from Cattle Point that morning and that they were now headed up the west side of San Juan Island. Dave got back on SJI around 1600 and soon got updates on the whales from Jeanne Hyde who were now in Boundary Pass. Dave jumped in Orca and, with the help of Jeff LaMarsh on Goldwing, got on scene in Boundary Pass at 1720 about two miles north of John's Pass. The T49As and T65As were pointed east with the T65As being a couple of hundred yards in front of the T49As. The two groups joined back up around 1742 and continued traveling, sometimes changing directions from east to north but generally heading toward the northwest side of Waldron Island. Around 1805, T49A, T49A3, and T49A4 split off from the others and slinked off to forage in the middle of Boundary Pass while T49A1 stuck with the T65As and continued toward the Waldron shoreline. Around 1830, Orca left the larger group to go look for the break away three only to miss T49A1 and the T65As kill a seal ( observed by the people on the boat Loki ) just on the inside of Fishery Point on Waldron Island. While the kill was happening, T49A, T49A3, and T49A4 quit their foraging and came hurrying back to join the others feeding on the kill. There was some post kill celebration as the whales fed-mainly from T65A4 who breached and spy hopped several times. The whales soon began heading north again, past Skipjack Island. T49A1 and T65A2 moved off together about a quarter mile east of the others and Orca ended the encounter at 1930 with the whales still heading north about three quarters of a mile north of Skipjack Island.
