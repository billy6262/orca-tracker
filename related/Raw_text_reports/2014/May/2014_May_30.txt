Orca Sightings for May 30, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
More whales up north today!! It's been an incredible season so far
around the Nanaimo area for Biggs
. We had a group today I have never seen before, the
T77's
around neck point heading west. The were just slowly cruising for the encounter but it's just amazing to see them, especially new ones for me. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
