============================================================

Entry 1:
The
T90s and T101s
traveling in a tight group
NW past Qualicum Beach
, Vancouver Island (furthest point north i've been on a tour so far).
T87
was also in attendance, but was traveling separate from the group (more than a mile away). - Tasli Shaw

T49S. Race Rocks
. - Capt. Jim Maya

The furthest north I've ever gone today!! We chased a report all the way up to
Qualicum Beach area before spotting the T90's, T101's and T87
. They had just made a kill when we first spotted them and celebrated with some breaches and tail slaps. They tightened up into a resting formation after and cruised west. It was such a beautiful day and amazing lighting to see them. Here are few shots of the 90's and 101's. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

I believe I saw
a humpback this morning 9am off of Sunset Marina in West Vancouver
.... Alone heading north up Howe Sound. - Lori Payne
