Orca Sightings for May 4, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Some more piccies from today's encounter with
20+/- transient (Bigg's) killer whales
between Portland Island and Salt Spring Island, British Columbia. - Katie Jones
*
It was so beautiful out by
Salt Spring Island.
I've lived in the area all my life and I'm continually awed by it all. I think I always will be.
T100C and T100.

Skipper Matt was notified of reports of
orcas
heading south from
Active Pass
and was able to join the whales traveling in small groups through Satellite Channel- which is roughly 40km from Victoria! - Prince of Whales Whale Watching
*

1:24 - Gray
is heading south now toward the
end of Whidbey
. - Gwendine Ellis Norton
*
A few rain-squalls didn't deter us today, and collaboration with 2 other whale watch boats was the key in locating
gray whale #723!
After searching in all directions, he turned up right by our home port of Langley, delighting our passengers with great views which included a good pass-by close to the boat. What a way to end the day! - Jill Hein, SSAMN.
