Orca Sightings for June 21, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lucky us. Whales two days in a row! Who wants to cook supper when you can watch whales from the shore of
Galiano Island
instead? Not us on Saturday around

6:30 pm
, when a larger and then smaller group of orcas went eastward
through Active Pass
. - Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island

WOW! Kind of day today. We knew
Residents were on west side San Juan Island and there were reports of Transients up north
. We went up San Juan Channel to intercept the Ressies as they came up Haro Strait headed north. All of a sudden comes a report of a bunch of Transients at Seal Rock, right at the west end of San Juan Channel, where it meets Haro Strait. We stopped on them. It was the
TO49A's and TO36A's swimming together. 7 animals.
We watched them take a seal and then here comes
J Pod
! Spread out across the strait. They were only about a half mile apart and that is rare. We hopped over to J Pod with Granny leading up Haro. Then here comes the
J 17's
in close to us. We hooked up with them and they started putting on an air show. Breaches and cartwheels. While we were with the J's the T's came into Haro Strait and started moving north right along the shore of Stuart Island. Awesome day. Great conditions. Looks like the J's (at least some of them) went up to the Fraser River and the L's stayed down to the south. - James Gresham

A bright, peaceful Saturday as
J-pod and part of L-pod intermingled and swam in resting lines towards San Juan Island
. It was so lovely to witness so many whales swimming so close together and in no hurry at all. - Sara Hysong-Shimazu

This morning around

11:30 J-Pod and part of L-Pod made their way north through Haro Strait in two big, tight groups
- I saw them from Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island.
Between 2 and 3 PM some (if not all) of the L-Pod whales made their way back south past Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. This time they were very spread out and doing some foraging as they slowly passed by. - Monika Wieland

Back to those wonderful
T's
today. We were initially heading to the west side to see the residents but got a report of whales up near
Thrasher rock off of Gabriola Island
. We headed up that way and picked up the
T124A's
hammering a seal in the distance. When we got closer they were just eating and celebrating. It's the best when you just shut off your engines and watch....they didn't move anywhere for almost 45 minutes we just drifted with them watching them celebrate and chow down. The breacher is T124A2A I believe, missing part of the fluke. - Gary Sutton

Great day yesterday in
Haro Strait with a pod of Transient Orcas
