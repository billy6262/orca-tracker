As we sat watching the water and enjoying food, up pops
a humpback whale
! Certainly a bonus to the towering mountains, shimmering waters, and dazzling skies. And then wouldn't ya know about an hour later here come some
transient (Bigg's) killer whales!
They were frolicking and doing lots of high speed lunges and spyhops as they
moved south down the island
when suddenly they put the skids on so fast and did a very abrupt about-face, turned tail and started cruising toward Victoria. Hmmm, that was interesting... We look south and then BIG SPLASH! Put up binoculars and... HOLY FLYING ORCAS, BATMAN! Here comes
J pod up the west side complete with J2 Granny
near the lead. Screw dinner theater - this is the most action-packed cafe I've ever had the pleasure of dining at... - Katie Jones
*

9:17 pm -
Several of
J pod
appear to be feeding after sunset at
Mitchell Point
, off of the west side of San Juan Island between Lime Kiln Point and Henry Island. They've shuffled back and forth at least twice, and are still going well after dark. It was a beautiful night, though, and it was magical seeing and hearing the whales offshore. - Tom Hoyt

3:27 - Residents inbound! Js at Race Rocks
. Ken Balcomb is on them. - James Gresham

Another incredible day on the water!! Spent most of the day with the
T86A's, T137's and T124A1
. T86A's mouth seemed to be open the whole day and looked to have some damage. After leaving the scene, we got a report that they joined up with another
18 whales!!!
We made a quick "U" turn and saw that the
T124's, T124A's, T77's and T65A's
came steam rolling south, appeared out of no where and joined the party!! 26 Bigg's killer whales! They were in a HUGE hurry bombing through
Active Pass
and going south. Amazing to such a large group of them! - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

At least
26 Bigg's killer whales
today .... a "personal best" for me! We were already privileged to watch the
T137s, 86As, and 124A1
be very social at the surface when we got on scene ... but then ... on the horizon we could see two lines of white froth and spray. The spray got closer and closer, revealing
at least 15 more orcas
speeding towards us from the west, all in one long line of porpoising whales (
T77s, T124s minus 124C, 124As, 65As, likely others as well
). You could practically hear Ride of the Valkyries playing as they steamed toward us. Totally awesome, fabulous creatures. I'm blown away yet again. T86A had her mouth open throughout the entire encounter, leading me to believe something is amiss ...You can see some water squirting out the side.- Tasli Shaw

BCY0324's calf
was taillobbing Saturday
afternoon
. - James Gresham

A glorious day on the water with sunshine, blue skies and seas. Mystic Sea caught up with
Big Momma and calf
around

1:45 pm off Sidney
, Vancouver Island, and watched as the pair chopped and changed direction a few times (plenty of good food hopefully) and gave more than one graceful wave of their tail flukes before taking a deep dive. A delight to see these huge baleen whales in our waters performing their own special ballet. - Sandra Pollard
