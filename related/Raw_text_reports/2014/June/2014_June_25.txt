Orca Sightings for June 25, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Wednesday's Wondrous Whales!!!! Sunny, glassy smooth water,
J and L pod
, caught up with them, sort of spread out, off
Eagle Point
(San Juan Island) ....heading north, gave the folks at
Lime Kiln
a thrill....then further up...formed up into groups, breaching, multiple big tail slaps, and a lot of rolling over and showing that beautiful white underside...two young ones, maybe Joy and Cousteau of L pod? Pictures to follow. Very happy group of passengers aboard Mystic Sea. Whoopee!!! - Bonnie Gretz
