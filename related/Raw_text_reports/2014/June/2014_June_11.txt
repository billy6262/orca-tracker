Orca Sightings for June 11, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tonight was amazing. The whales were incredible, the water was flat, and there were only a couple other boats out there to experience it with. I got to spend some quality time with my favorite
J Pod family as well, the J16s
. What a rush, enjoy the pictures. - Heather MacIntyre.

It's been a great year so far with T's but it was nice to be reunited with, at least a few, residents today. The
J22's and J32
were split from the rest of J pod and were hanging out near
Sand Heads in the Strait of Georgia
. Lots of fishing and zig zagging around but J32 "Rhapsody" was the star of the show today. Spyhops, breaches, tail slaps and pec slaps. They were quite spread but she was having a great time. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver
*
J-pod went up and down San Juan Island
throughout the day, and we had a surprise visit from Split Fin, one of our well known humpbacks! - Prince of Whale Whale Watching

WA State Ferries reports
ten orcas in Rosario Strait this morning at 7 am
