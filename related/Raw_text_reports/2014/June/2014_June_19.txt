Orca Sightings for June 19, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a
Minke Whale spyhop!
Quick note: Minke whales are the second smallest baleen whale and spend about 90% of their time underwater. We were sitting in the water glassing for killer whales, everything was quiet, when suddenly "Koosh"- there's a Minke Whale 100 yards off our port starring at us, baleen exposed and all! Welp, there's a first for everything. I must admit, for a short second, I was wondering what the heck I was looking at!! So cool ... - Heather MacIntyre

OK...It just keeps getting better.
All of J Pod and most all of the Ls, off of South Beach, San Juan Island
, ...Socializing all afternoon and into the evening... - Capt. Jim Maya
*
Distant but very lazy and playful whales this evening at dusk off the
west side of San Juan Island. Most of L-Pod came in today to join the Js
. - Monika Wieland
*
Well not many words or pictures could accurately depict what went on today.
L's were racing in from out west and J's were pushing offshore
very quickly to meet them. Once they joined up, there was
mish mash of J's and L's interacting like crazy
. Breaching, spy hops and much more but the highlight is always when they start logging on the surface, vocalizing above the surface, pushing each other around, touching and rubbing. Incredible day
3 miles offshore of Eagle pt
. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

8:08pm - calls on LK.
- Jill M Rotset
*
No Ks and NOT all of Ls
(from what I heard) - but a very good chunk of them. Today was epic! Lots of rolly polly behavior and BIG groups of very happy whales doing pretty much nothing. I hope that means they are FULL of salmon. They spent hours
off Eagle Point with the Js socializing
. - Katie Jones
*
We left them at around
7pm off of Eagle Point
... Lots of hugging and kissing with the occasional sea snake. No direction. - Spencer Domico
*
Alisa and Ed Brooks updated their report:

12:45 pm, watching the meet up of J and L pods
, about
1 mile out from South Beach, SW San Juan Island
. They
first met up at
12:15
, with tons of breaches. Sounds like a great whale day off San Juan Island!
*
Obviously we have no way of knowing when they last saw one another but heartwarming to know they do greet one another and have "things to say" and activities to share when they come together. Honestly, the breaching and tail lobbing was endless. My only (selfish) wish is that they were closer in or at Lime Kiln.

7:47 -
got to County Park a little after 7, looked like they were already well north could see far off distant blows, shimmering bodies and one spyhop. Northbound they go...unless.

6:35 am - Loud calls on Orca Sound
. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

5:57 -
I am emailing to report a sighting of a whale, off of
Day Island in University Place
(south of Tacoma Narrows). It was a smaller whale with a small curved dorsal fin located further down the back. I saw the whale
between
8:00pm and
9:30pm
. It stayed just off the south end of Day Island, circling the area and puffing air through its blowhole. - Jennie S.
