============================================================

Entry 1:
5:05 - Whales on Lime Kiln
. - James Gresham

6:30 PM - Large pod possibly L pod in Boundary pass
just off Pender Island, traveling. We encountered a large pod, could not count how many so thinking that it might be the largest, L pod? - Natalie Fallis
*
As we picked up
J and L pods on the Canadian side of Haro Strait
they were spread out and most were in resting pattern. Taking a little break as they crossed Haro Strait towards the southern side of San Juan Island. As they approached the island they became more active and appeared to begin hunting salmon. Watching them at rest in tight groups, surfacing and breathing in unison is always wonderful. It was amazing to watch. They
gathered in the False Bay
area with a couple groups of L's further south. One of the females out in front if False Bay started slapping her tail and the whales to the south made a beeline to join up with the others. L92 was with the southernmost whales. - James Gresham

We were out with the
Transient Gangs 101's and 102, as well as the 002C's
. We came on scene as the T's were coming together out of Hoskyns Channel (
far north end of Georgia Strait
), west side of Reid Island. We stayed with them as they rounded Viner Point and headed North up the Reid Isl shoreline. Mostly just swimming, resting, some lazy tail lobs and such. we left them @ 1700hrs Northbound up Reid Isl. Of note to us were some new rake marks for 102 here, and the fact that 002C2 Tumbo was lagging behind the family a bit again. Today he was with 101B alot of the time......looked almost like escorting or staying with him anyways. It was interesting to watch anyways. - Nick Templeman
*
T137's in Boundary Pass.
They were SUPER mellow just cruising east through the pass in a very close intimate family group. I love seeing them so relaxed....don't get me wrong, breaches are great but it's just so different and calming to see them like this. - Gary Sutton
*
Maybe transients --

7:00 PM - 6-8 whales moving westward just east of Thieves Bay Marina, North Pender Island
. We are waiting in anticipation for additional whales. May be a transient pod. - Ken Plato
*
Last night around
5pm I saw 2 whales
passing my beach so I kayaked out and followed them from Davis Head to the Richardson dock (going counterclockwise around Lopez) off the
south end of Lopez Island
. I'm fairly certain they were gray whales and had barnacles or other white growth on them. - Thomas (Dylan) Cline

Whale sighting
in Discovery Bay by Adelma Beach. Possible Gray Whale
. Very close to the beach at low tide around
11 AM
or so. - Aki Valdehuesa Avelino
