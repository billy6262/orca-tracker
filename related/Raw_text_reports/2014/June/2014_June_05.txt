Orca Sightings for June 5, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
had fun today chasing salmon up and down the west side o
f San Juan Island
! They started the morning southbound, passing
Lime Kiln
and continuing to Salmon Bank, where they foraged for a couple of hours. Then they revisited Lime Kiln briefly only to turn south again for Salmon Bank, where they feasted, tailslapped, and breached for quite a while (frustratingly just out of reach of a shore based camera). Back north again in the evening,
not quite to the West Side Preserve before they turned south just before sunset
. This photo (a cell phone shot of my camera LCD) is from their afternoon Lime Kiln visit. The orcas seem to be eating well! - Meg McDonald

I can hear them now! I can hear them now! YAY! I have no idea what that sound was at

11:25 a.m
. It sounded like a hideously high pitched fire alarm. I've never heard a boat sound like that before...but then my head isn't usually under water. It hurt MY ears. Can't imagine what it does to the whales. Plus, the squeals have awakened my cats - who are now sitting at my computer listening to the vocalizations, too. Funny! - Kim Merriman

10:56 - 20 Killer Whales
sighted today. We have
most of J Pod
in our waters. Including
Granny
the 103 year old. - Simon Pidcock
