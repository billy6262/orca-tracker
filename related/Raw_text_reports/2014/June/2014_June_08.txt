Orca Sightings for June 8, 2014
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi - we were headed to
Desolation Sound
, from Gorge Harbor (north end of Georgia Strait), and encountered
a small pod of Orcas on the west side of Hernando Island
, about

9:30 am
. Two very large males, some females, and we think, a youngster! First time we've ever seen a pod of Orcas way up here; such a delight! Apparently, this pod of about 7 cruised through Pender Harbour a couple of weeks ago! - Katie Bunnell

J Pod came down Boundary Pass
and continued down Haro Strait. Apparently they went up north late last night. They had just passed Saturna when we were notified. We got on them at the bottom of San Juan Channel and followed them to Henry Island. - James Gresham
*

7:10 AM - Orcas off Anacortes ferry dock
headed west right now. - James Mead Maya

The
T's were in San Juan Channel
between Friday Harbor and Speiden Island. Hunting seals as the tide came in and covered the rocks they were hauled out on. All were trending slowly west towards the Sydney area. - James Gresham
