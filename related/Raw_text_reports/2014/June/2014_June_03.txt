Today I was out at
Norwegian Park, in Hansville
, with my two little boys exploring and I KNOW I saw
a large black animal with a fin
swimming in the
direction of Point No Point
. It was very far out, about the center of the waterway. I watched for a good 15 minutes as it came up to the surface, went back down, came up, just moving about at its own pace with no real hurry or obvious playtime. Nothing at all like the harbor seals we have seen hanging about happily fishing. (too far out for the camera on my phone to get a decent shot). - Jessica Coffman

Big Mama and her calf
were moving north
through Haro and entering Boundary Pass
. These pics were taken north of Turn Point on Stuart Island. - Heather MacIntyre

Today:
35 resident killer whales, 4 Bigg's killer whales, and a Big Momma the humpback with her new calf.
..all within 5ish miles of each other. Not bad Salish Sea, not bad. Never made it down to the residents, but it turned out to be the
T137A
show for us! Not once but TWICE he made a beeline for the boat from 100 yards away and appeared to inspect the hull. I'm presuming there must have been a harbour seal hiding under us. Wowza. I am SO FREAKING LUCKY and honoured (??? right word????) to see these things. - Tasli Shaw

Probably my personal favorite shot from the "whale of an afternoon" on
June 3rd. From front to back:
J2 Granny, J37 Hy'Shqa, J49 Ti'lem I'nges, J36 Alki, and J16 Slick
. Photo taken from shore at San Juan County Land Bank's Westside Preserve. - Monika Weiland,

Js and Ls off the westside
just happy to be together. - Sara Hysong Shimazu

Epic
Orcas today off Lime Kiln State Park
on San Juan Island! Members of
J-pod and L-pod came within 100 feet of shore
(some were MUCH closer than that even!) and swam back and forth several times. It was one of the most amazing Killer Whale encounters I've ever had. It is such an amazing thing, to see Killer Whales in the wild, and in a huge. - Chris Teren

So if anyone wonders why I get up early, stay up late, freeze, starve, get drenched, run up hills, run down hills, run out of work, keep my bag packed at all times, or in general seem a little crazy....it's for the supreme honor of witnessing moments like this. Today
the rest of J-Pod and the L12s (at least) joined in the fun
. It was epic stuff
on the west side
this afternoon. I'm still basking in the afterglow of such an amazing encounter. - Monika Weiland

I quite simply haven't the words to describe today. Easily one of my best shore encounters ever with
J pod and... L pod!
That's right! Those little sneakers popped into the islands last night. Our day started bright and early...only it wasn't so bright this morning. Lots of fog, mist, and wind. After sitting on the west side of the island for three hours with nothing materializing, it was time to go to town and grab breakfast. Midway through the meal we get the report: lots and LOTS of orcas at Eagle Point northbound which then ensued the unhealthy shoving down of food and running for the door (we did remember to pay ). Upon reaching the west side at Land Bank we saw
J2 Granny, J19 Shachi, J41 Eclipse, and J26 Mike
meandering up the coastline. They looked as if they might come close into shore which then caused us to go huffing and puffing quickly up the hill to drive down to Lime Kiln Lighthouse. While scrambling down onto the rocks at the light, Granny came by with the other three, but instead of continuing north, they turned and went back south. OH NO! We made the wrong decision to leave Land Bank which turned quickly into regret and shaming ourselves for not being patient. BUT! That's when things began to change. As we looked to the south, we began to see more and more and
MORE orcas rounding Edwards Point
. They were in very tight, playful groups and they were so close to shore! Oh...if only they keep coming this way... And did they ever! They came in close at the lighthouse. They were practically at our feet as they socialized and frolicked in the silvery afternoon sun, adrenaline pounding through our systems like a happy wrecking ball, squeals of exuberance. - Katie Jones

Oh my gosh I don't even have words for the EPICNESS that happened at
Lime Kiln
this afternoon. One of the best shore encounters in my 8 years here. I had
15+ orcas 100ft off shore
of me stall out at the surface. Video and pics coming.. Eventually when the shock wears off. - Traci Walter
