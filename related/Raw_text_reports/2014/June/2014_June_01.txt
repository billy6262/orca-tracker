Really excited to share this one with you all. What a spectacular sunset pass by
J Pod
last night. Lots of "dorcas" or "orcaholics" if you will, were in attendance. And no one really left until it was so dark, you could barely see. The clicks you hear in the video were live streamed by
Lime Kiln's hydrophone
that you can listen to with any wifi ready device. The hammering sounds, are echolocation they use to find fish. There is a special appearance by a River Otter as well that was playing in the kelp beds. - Traci Walter

A great way to start Orca month (June) with
Granny - J-2
- leading a large J-pod group by
Henry Island
.
Many T's in the area on the west side of Orcas Island
....whales all over....calm seas, sunny skies = paradise. - Jill Hein

J2 "Granny"
leading the way. Her great grandson
J45
is behind her and great great grandson
J49
is at the back. - Tasli Shaw

Around

11:30 AM
I watched the
J22s and J14s
head north close to shore past
Lime Kiln Point State Park
. I believe the rest of
J-Pod
that was present was already further north. At

3:30 PM
I saw a very distant
group of transients from Reuben Tarte State Park
- heading from Presidents Channel towards Flat Top Island, then a bit later heading across and around the north end of Spieden Island. From

8:30 to
10:00 PM
very, very spread out
J-Pod
whales headed south past
Lime Kiln
- at least the
J14s and J16s
were present. It got too dark before we could see if the rest of Js came down with them! - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
*

9:19 am -
WHAT?? Two mornings in a row... LOVE this place!!
J pod headed up island
again! - Erin Corra
*
About
8am
- A fairly large
(10+) pod of orcas
travelling east to west past
Iceberg Point (Lopez Is.)
- very dispersed. - Tom Reeves
*
T100C near Flat-Top Island
, heading east. - Jill Hein
*

5:40 -
Stephanie Raymond called from the Victoria Clipper with
four Transients off Partridge Point
(west side of north-central Whidbey Island). She saw one adult male and three females or juveniles heading roughly NW.
*
There were
over 20 Bigg's Killer Whales and 16 Resident Killer Whales
in our waters today. We decided to spend our time with the the northern groups of Bigg's with just a couple of other boats
just south of Nanaimo
. The whole time we were with them they alternated between eating Pacific Harbour Seals and socializing. The youngsters were packing seal carcasses with them and clearly very happy about it. - Simon Pidcock
*
The first breach caught us all by surprise since
T124A2
nearly hopped in the boat with us. - Andy Scheffler
*
On the way to
J Pod
we saw a dinky little
Minke at Salmon Bank
yesterday. Look at the gulls for size perspective. - James Gresham
