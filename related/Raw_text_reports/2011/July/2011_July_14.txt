We headed south out of Friday Harbor this afternoon with word that there were killer whales around
False Bay
. Once at False Bay we caught a glimpse of three dorsal fins and some spouts, then there were six+ dorsal fins all coming up from underneath the glassy Salish Sea. It was
J-pod
. They were slowly traveling close to each other, nearly synchronized in their surfacing. After spending some time with the whales, we headed back towards Salmon Bank. As soon as we got to that area, we spotted
a single minke whale
and watched it surface a few times before it disappeared into the depths.

Hydrophone reports
After listening to previously recorded transient calls on the OrcaSound website, I believe the calls I was hearing and posted on your FB page from this morning was
Transients
(Meg posted so too). Lime Kiln hydrophones, starting at

7:15am
for about ten minutes. And then again roughly every ten minutes would hear a few more calls at a time, last ones being at

8:10 am
. Faint but very audible, a lone descending call.
