J pod
was spread out along the southwest coast (
San Juan Island, WA
) in smaller groups. It consisted of the mature male Mike (J-26) whose sea snake was present and the flashing of pink startled and confused the passengers. As we headed further north we saw a formation of four with whom we believed to have Granny (J-2) and Riptide (J-30) leading. The juveniles we passed along the way were continuously lob tailing and we even witnessed a few breaches.

2 pm: Three Orca
were reported in Calm Channel heading Northward towards Church House. Overheard through broken radio reception from an unknown source.

We had a report of
3 Orca
in Calm Channel outside of Churchhouse this afternoon at about
2pm
. As the boater had already returned to the dock so the sighting was likely at about 12 or 1230pm. No one was able to find them - and between all the tour operators that were out we covered a lot of ground. Nonetheless, still an amazing day on the water, great Eagle Show at Jimmy Judd island with about 100+ eagles.

Whale Watching

We were boating near
Kingtson
when
two large Humpback whales
appeared out of nowhere! They were playing and jumping fully out of the water making huge splashes. They were playing for about a 1/2 hour and then disappeared. We got some great shots of them on the calm water. Also, there must have been 20+ dolphin-like creatures surfacing on the water all around us with the whales. I couldn't believe how many there were (
these were likely Harbor porpoise ON
).

Below reports from Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, BC
:

Harbour Porpoises

Dall's Porpoise
were zig zagging by the entrance to Bute Inlet.

Of the
two humpback whales
photographed by Scott Zaffram one (thin patches of white on fluke) matches the Point no Point whale that Jeff Hogan was able to get good photos of
June 2. The second is hard to tell due to angle, but could possibly be the same animal from Fox Island photographed 19 June.
