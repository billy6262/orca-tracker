Every time you capture something like
J34
taking a peak at some kayakers, people think I used photoshop. NO! This happened in the
afternoon
at the southern tip of
Henry Island
. It was amazing for my passengers and probably for the kayakers from Sea Quest Kayaking Expeditions out of Friday Harbor. Yep, kayakers really bother the Orcas!

Up in the Swanson Channel off
North Pender Island
, we caught up with a mixed pod of orca whales. Both
J and K pods
were socializing in a group of about 15-20 individual orcas. One passenger assisted in confirming the identity of J-34 "Double stuf" (son to "Oreo," brother to "Cookie;" see a theme here?!). Back at the whales we saw the new baby, K44, swimming just next to and behind mom before we had to start making our way back to the harbor.

We found the whales around
Turn Point
headed south but they turned around as soon as we got there and started going north, which was perfect for us! We saw the
J2 matriline
mostly but we saw
J16
also. A few breaches, spyhops and some frolicking around made for a great day. Here is a picture of a spyhop (see below) and another of a J pod female on her side and you can see her eye looking right at us.

About
6 pm
, [
orcas
] entered
Active Pass
from the west and went past our Orca Rock at a blazing speed on a fast tide.
Ks and Js
, as best I can tell from my amateur id'ing. Who is it with the square chunk out of its dorsal fin (J47)? Some tail slaps and a cartwheel on a sunny evening.
