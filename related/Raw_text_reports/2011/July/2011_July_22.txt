We slowed and went across Spieden Island. It didn't take much longer until we saw the first signs of
killer whales
; spouts were up ahead! Then dorsal fins! After watching for a few minutes we realized that there were a lot of whales, twenty plus, milling around in very close proximity to one another. It looked like there were members from both
J and K pod
in the group, and there was a very small, orange calf that didn't look like K44! (new calf possibly?!). A

Taken from shore as the large group of
orcas (Js and K13s)
very slowly made their way north along the west side of
San Juan Island
late this
morning
. They had formed a giant resting line somewhere along the way, and maintained that resting pattern as they ever so slowly made their way north. They reached
Kellett Bluff at about
11:00 am
, but were still near there at noon. I think I saw little K44 in the mix. I believe there are other residents somewhere south of the Lime Kiln lighthouse.
