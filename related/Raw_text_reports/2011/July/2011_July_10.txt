2:15 pm, 4 or 5 orcas
, 1 male and 3-4 others, are 50 feet off the beach, 200 yards west of the
Keystone
(Coupeville) ferry dock, in the kelp, not going anywhere. No IDs yet. Called in by Billy Wind.
I rushed out to the beach but they were already gone and nobody knew which way they went. Some reports said there were ten orcas. -HG

I was out fishing off of Secretary Island in
Sooke
with a pink salmon on the line when a pod of
about a dozen orca
rolled through the area around
noon
. A large male was definitely heading straight for us and went under the boat. We netted the fish just before it became whale food. The pod was heading towards Race Rocks spread out over a half km. They cruised right through a group of around 20 boats. L pod?? A friend told me that a pod had rolled through same time on Saturday as well.

We decided to go see
J Pod
at
Turn Point
, and by the time we headed up north they were already approaching the Pender Bluffs in Canada. We watched as a very large group of Js were slowly moving their way along the shoreline.
J27
and gang were definitely checking out the kelp beds, and at one point, the whales were being watched on all sides-us on the outside side of the whales, and harbor seals and people along shore. Lots of surface percussives including spyhops and breaches! Time passed far too quickly and soon it was time to head back to port.
A quick lunch break and we left the dock,
Ks
were still doing the "west side shuffle" along
San Juan Island
. And as we headed out of Cattle Pass, we took a wide swing out past Salmon Bank and found a small
minke whale
. Flat calm waters made spotting the whale from quite a distance easy! Before long, we were off again to go see K Pod. We were only with Ks for a bit before they suddenly veered offshore and began to vocalize quite loudly. This just so happened to coincide with a call on the phone from one of our Canadian friends who told us that the members of
L Pod
that had been out west had made it to
Discovery Island
and were headed right towards San Juan. So a short reposition and soon we were viewing over 30 members of L Pod! L79 Skana. L41 Mega. As the whales got closer to K Pod, they began to slap the water with their tails. At one point there were 6-7 whales tailslapping at the same time. One female passed the Western Explorer and decided to push her calf onto her rostrum! Lots of vocals, spyhops, a few breaches, and the whales began to mill everywhere at once! Soon though it was time to head back, but we did manage to find
3 more minkes (for a total of 4)
.

Today at

1:15 PM orcas
were just approaching Land Bank's Westside Preserve on
San Juan Island
when they turned south. I, too, went south to American Camp, where the whales passed still heading south between
2:15 and
2:45 PM. Some animals were several miles offshore, but the
K12s and K14s
passed fairly close to shore at the point near Grandma's Cove.

Members of
J pod
slowly headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
this morning.
J2 Granny
was in the lead. I heard
J8 Speiden
not too far behind. I'm not an expert on identifying individual orcas, but it seemed like the orcas were traveling more or less in family groups -- the J14s with little J45 and several other orcas, the six J17 family members along with a few other orcas, etc.

Yesterday
afternoon Lpod
was east bound, past
Victoria
, heading to Eagle point to meet up with the K's. Lots of vocals from Lpod, and I heard on the radio Kpod was vocalising loudly as well, as the two groups were getting closer.

Aboard the Island Explorer 3 on the early morning we encountered a
Minke Whale at Salmon Bank
. Then we headed north and saw a few
K's
heading South. There were others spread out on all sides of the boat. As the other whales traveled northbound, the southbound Orcas change direction. We soon found ourselves among the K's. I spotted K-40 Raggedy, K-21 Cappuccino & K-26 Lobo. We spotted K-27 Deadhead with her new calf K-44 swimming right next to mom learning the ropes. He looks so small in comparison to a mature male like Cappuccino. Lots of happy tail slapping, pec slapping, a spyhop by the young ones and one spectacular headstand. We couldn't ID everyone but we did see K-13 Skagit, K-25 Scoter, K-31 Cali, K-20 Spock & K-38 Comet. They ended up in 4 groups traveling Northbound.

These
orcas
just came by heading north where they turn and typically go through
Active Pass
after passing the north part of North Pender Island. Before I saw any I could hear breaches south of me. As they came into my view no breaches were observed, however, they were in quite close to the shore this time. They were moving relatively quickly, passing by here from about

12:10 to
12:40 p.m
. How gorgeous are these lovely orcas! How lucky are we that they are still on the planet and here in the Salish Sea, despite our constant effort with myriad manners to mess up their environment.

Another beautiful day as we motored toward
False Bay
. As we drew closer we could see dorsal fins here and there. We sat, turned off the engines and observed whales in every direction. We were watching a female moving along our port side when we spied a mini dorsal fin on the other side of her. It was the smallest
orca
I have ever seen. When we dropped the hydrophone our suspicions were confirmed. We heard the familiar kitten-like calls of K pod. It could only have been the new baby K I have heard so much about over the last few days. The mom and calf moved but we sat and observed other individuals moving through the area. We listened to faint calls and it was even calm enough to hear echolocation noises.

Around

10:15 am
, a small group of
5 or so orcas
(transients?) went east with the tide past our Orca Rock in
Active Pass
. Then later: We came back to our place from gathering wild strawberries just in time to catch the last 10 or so whales passing by, heading east through Active Pass around

2:15 pm
. Whales twice today!

Out on the Island Caper for a tour, headed up north into Plumper Sound (BC) to try and catch
J pod
headed towards
Active Pass
. Timing was perfect - we found them in resting mode (all tight together, slowly going along and surfacing all at the same time) just before they entered the Pass. We followed slowly behind as they went through (LOTS of boats in the Pass, including 2 huge BC ferries, and many rec/sport and whale watch boats) - hugged the north shoreline tightly and could see they were starting to "wake up" - spreading out, surfacing at different times, tail lobbing, upside down swimming. And once they hit the open water of Strait of Georgia, all heck broke loose - they started breaching, spyhopping, lots of tail smacks, lunging - what a show! We even saw a double breach (caught on film)!! This continued for a good half hour, and about half way across the Strait, we unfortunately had to say goodbye to head back south. Another gorgeous day out there - flat calm waters - we could still see the whales cavorting many miles off as we headed home. Doesn't get much better than that - thanks, Capt. Don!

We encountered
15+/- transient orcas
off the south end of
San Juan Island
yesterday at approx.

13:00
. Lots of great activity from the whales including many spyhops.
