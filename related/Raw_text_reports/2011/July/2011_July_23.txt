I have never seen whales actually pull into
Friday Harbor
. When we found the group of
J's
they were just north of the harbor. They were cruising slowly south. I was expecting total chaos. The whales continued lazily down the channel. More spy hops, a breach, lots of inverted tail slapping, and at one point one of the adults just laid on his back. It looked like they were enjoying the sunshine as much as we were. As the whales turned to corner in toward the harbor we departed and cruised south to find other wildlife. We saw seals, pups, eaglets, harbor porpoise, and even a school of fish. The sea was alive today. When we reached cattle point we turned around and headed back up the san juan channel toward the harbor. The whales were still moving south, but had slowed to resting pace, slowly surfacing to breathe and taking some longer dives. Suddenly we got a call. Tucker the whale scat-sniffing dog had located his quarry. We stopped where we were and watched Tucker work.He ran from side to side and wagged his tail furiously.Finally we saw the scoop go into the water and Tucker was rewarded with his tennis ball.
