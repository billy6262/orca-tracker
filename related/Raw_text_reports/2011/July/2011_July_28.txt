Orca Sightings for July 28, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
The black dorsals of
J and K pod
broke the chop of
Haro Strait
as we made our way towards Victoria. We then allowed the strong current that had worked against us to now be in our favor as it pushed us towards the west coast of San Juan Island, drifting beside the orcas. We saw Deadhead (K-27), who was named after the singer of the Grateful Dead who passed the year of her birth, and her three-week-old son. The passengers (and the naturalists) gasped as she unexpectedly spyhopped to check out her terrestrial surroundings.

OMG! We were awoken at

1:00am
this morning to the sound of flapping fins! We jumped out of our tent and ran to the bluffs at the county park, and could not believe our eyes! Right down in front of us, not 50 feet away, were 3-5 orcas slapping the water, making a wonderful racket! All of the sudden, they stopped slapping and started vocalizing, and I swear they sounded almost human! They were rolling around in the water. We stayed and watched until
3:15! And when we turned around to walk back to out campsite, one of the orcas jumped up and made a loud splash! We missed the jump, but we saw the splash! It was totally amazing!
