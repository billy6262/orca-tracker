Orca Sightings for July 15, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were following
J's
around
Eagle Point
on
San Juan Island
when all of a sudden they turned towards Victoria waterfront and started traveling quickly. Shortly after we started seeing whales coming from Victoria waterfront towards the J's and turned out to be L'
s and K's
. They put on quite a show during the reunion and there were whales everywhere!

Today! This
morning around
7:30
I heard the whales loud and clear before viewing them! It sounded like Jurassic Park at Eagle Cove! HUGE slaps, claps and cannon ball sounds! The water was flat and glassy and their blows echoed against the rocks. I ran out to the edge of the bluff as I didn't want to miss viewing this early morning party! The whales closest to shore approached from the North around Eagle Point. They were frisky, tail lobbing and pec slapping, some looked to be chasing fish back and forth. While further out into the strait there was a BIG party going on! Huge breaches by multiple whales, full body out of the water over and over again. I counted over 30 breaches in a 30 minute period. Although the breaching was far out in the strait, the loud clapping sound as they hit the flat surface of the water carried across the strait in warp time! The whales closer to shore turned around and headed north again, the group further out in the straight finished their acrobatics and turned towards shore, following the route of the others, about 15 minutes behind them. What a beautiful way to start the day!

We continued on through Cattle Pass and quickly found a great group of
Orcas near False Bay
. As we slowly approached and started watching one group, we saw even more whales in every direction around us. The word from other vessels on the scene was that
Ks and Ls
were moving in to the area to hang out with the
Js
. It seemed like just about every member of the Southern Resident Community was spread from close to shore to the Olympic Peninsula. It was incredible! Unfortunately we had to head back to the harbor, but on the way we encountered a
Minke whale
as well as the most harbor seals I've ever seen around the boat playing and feeding in the tide rips.
