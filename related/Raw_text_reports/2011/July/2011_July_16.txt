Granny surprised us by popping up twice with a couple of probing spyhops to suss out the humans watching
J's and L's
from the shoreline south of
Lime Kiln
. She passed quietly on her way after foraging among the kelp beds with a newly decorated dorsal fin trailing kelp.

We headed south, and as we turned around Cattle Point it started to clear up, giving us good visibility. As soon as we reached
False Bay
, off in the distance was a large, triangular dorsal fin. Soon after that we were surrounded by
killer whales
, and even got to see a younger one breach three times before swimming off. We followed the whales back towards Cattle Point then headed towards Salmon Bank in search minke whales.

The sun came out on the west side of
San Juan Island
in the
late afternoon
a mile or so south of Lime Kiln St Park (at those great viewing sites along the road) and so did the
orcas
! We assume they were J pod, as we checked at the park earlier in the morning and were told that J pod was over in Oak Bay near Victoria at that time. When they came close to shore in the Lime Kiln area I got two photos. They were taken within four seconds of each other at
6:25pm. Note that a young whale is with the belly-up mom in one of the photos. Most of the whales swam back and forth along this area for at least 1 hours, obviously feeding. Didnt get a count of just how many were there in total, but certainly there were at least 15 and probably many more than that - spread out quite a bit from south of where we were watching to north of us at the viewing spot up at lime kiln state park. Lots of breeches, spy hops. Males were visible farther out. By
6:30 pm or so 3-4 whale watching boats arrived on the scene.

occasionally coming to the surface to take a breath.
