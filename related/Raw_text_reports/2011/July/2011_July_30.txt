Orca Sightings for July 30, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw what appears to be
4 Transient Orcas
off of
Gabriola Island
. The lone male appeared first and stayed for a little bit in one area. The other 3 joined later. They would come up and go down, staying near the surface in one area, possibly feeding. They then carried on to some rocky islands headed North. My guess is there were seals on the rocks. I even saw one lye on its back and tail lob. I looked through the transients. Is this possibly T030A? Does he have a bend to the left on his dorsal? It was neat. Only too bad I was on shore! Binoculars were great!

A splendid whale day with not one but two sightings of
orcas
heading east through
Active Pass
. Around

3:30 pm
the first group,
K pod
I believe, went through on a very fast tide. They were accompanied by at least 10 boats so it was very busy in the Pass. Around

7:15 pm
and for about an hour, a second parade of
Js and Ls
came past our Orca Rock. Very spread out, in small groups, fishing as they went. Some tail lobs, a cartwheel, sideways swimming, a few breaches and spyhops.

BC to say she was watching a
pod of orca
s entering
Active Pass
from the south.

Candy Neville called Orca Network to report
a single orca
seen this morning at

9:30 am
from Hiway 1 south of
Yachats, OR
. It was about 50 yards from shore.
