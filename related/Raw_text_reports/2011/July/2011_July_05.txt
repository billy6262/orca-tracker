Entry 1:
We received a phone call from Boomer Wright (sp?) at

R, reporting a sighting of
6 orcas
, 4 females & two juveniles, in front of the Sea Lion caves for about 1/2 hr, then heading south.

J-pod
very spread out near
Active Pass
, but well worth the trip to find J2 Granny (she doesn't look any older), Speiden, Double Stuf and various other J-pod members. They were headed towards Cherry Point when we left them to head back to Anacortes.

We took a long trip north today with reports that there were
killer whales
hanging around
Saturna
in Canadian waters. The ride out was beautiful. The sun was shining, there was a clear view of Mt. Baker, and the waters were calm and glassy. What's even better is that the trip up was totally worth it; J-pod was in the area. We were able to identify Riptide and Slick amongst the individuals we encountered.

The resident
orcas
headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
early this morning. I believe the group included all the
Js, the K13s, and presumably L87
. This photo is of J47 and one of the other J17 family calves (J44 or J46; I think all three calves were traveling in their own little group for a while).
