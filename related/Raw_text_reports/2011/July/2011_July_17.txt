Orca Sightings for July 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found lots of [
orcas
] today by
False Bay. Js and Ls
, not sure if any Ks were with them or not. They were spread out, mostly feeding, but around

2:30
noticed some sea snake activity. as a group of 10 or 12 came by very close to Mystic Sea what a treat the water was dead calm, no motor noise anywhere, just the magic of whales breathing. When we left they were slightly south of False Bay, slowly heading south.
