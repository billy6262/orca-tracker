Orca Sightings for July 25, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We kept motoring south around the corner toward
False Bay
. Finally up ahead we saw dorsal fins. The big male [
orca
] that had been about 400 yards off our starboard side suddenly surfaced behind us. We motored away to get out of his path, but again he turned toward us and surfaced off our stern. The whales were cruising. There was a lot of direction change and I hope, for their sake, there was some epic hunting happening.
