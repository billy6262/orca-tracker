Orca Sightings for July 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas
came by east of
North Pender Island, BC
around
noon
. They were spread out and one could see two or three close together at times, but more often one, then another one--for over an hour. My home is just north of Thieves Bay.

Reports below from Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC,
Powell River
, B.C.
:

7:40 am
: The radio call came in from a fisherman on the boat R&R that he spotted around
8 Orca
around the Salmon Point / Miracle Beach on the Vancouver Island side and Sentry Shoal,
mid Georgia Strait
heading Northward.

8:35 am
: The first of the tours from Painter's Lodge found the
Orca
doing their disappearing act just South of Mitlenatch Island.

10:30 am
: Aaron, Campbell River Whale Watching called to let me know that he had identified
T19B, T19 and possibly T19C
in one of the groups. They were still heading in a North-West direction by Mitlenatch Island doing some tail slapping intermixed with long dives.
After we got back from our WW tour, we heard that there were up to
a dozen Orca
at Bates Beach about b this morning!! Confirmation by one senior guide that at least 1 large male. No direction.
Jack, Campbell River Whale Watching
2 pm
: Just North of Campbell River by Brown's Bay and Seymour Narrows a group of
3 of the Transients
were spotted by AJ, Painter's Lodge.

2:30 pm
: Through broken radio transmission I heard that there were
"some" Orca
by McMullan Point, Dent Rapids. I believe it was Warren on Tenacious 3, Discovery Marine Safaris.
4 pm
:
Three Orca
including
T170
were by Chatham Point working their way up along the Vancouver Island shoreline still in a Westerly direction up into Johnstone Strait.
Garry, Aboriginal Journeys

6:20 pm
: The 5 Orca that stayed below Campbell River headed to the East side of Quadra Island and worked their way around and back down Hoskyns Channel towards Heriot Bay by the Breton Islands. This group included T19 and there was at least one calf in the mix.

Rough seas in the Straits Wednesday evening, but we were able to spot
a large pod
come around the
south end of Lopez 7 to
7:30p
m, going east to west.

Jill Hein of Coupeville was camping at
Deception Pass State Park
, and called at

4:50 pm
to report
8+ orcas
in Rosario Strait, heading south, with more splashes further out in the Strait. At least one male was present - they were too far off to ID.
*
Doug Smith called at

4:35 pm
from West Beach,
Deception Pass State Park
, to report a pod of
3 or 4 orcas
leaping out of the water in
Rosario Strait
, about 500 - 600 yards off shore, putting on a show.
*
The
Js and K13s
headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
. This is believed to be
K27 and her newborn calf, K44
.
Jane Cogan, San Juan Island, WA
*
Orca Network saw a Facebook post this afternoon from Island Adventures Whale Watching about
a new calf in K pod
, then shortly after received the photo and report above from Jane Cogan, then confirmation from Astrid van Ginneken of the Center for Whale Research that a new calf was photographed today with K27, and designated "K44" by the Center for Whale Research. While they were photographing the whales and getting ID shots of the new calf, K27 rolled under her new baby, and lifted him up so they could see the markings on the underside and determine that K44 is a male (gender often isn't known for weeks, months, or sometimes years)!

OrcaSound/Lime Kiln Hydrophone reports - pm
:
~

9:50 -
10:20 pm
: AMAZING PARTYING calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
now! They are practically blowing our speakers out - they must be having a baby shower for K44. They went from loud and constant calls and echolocating, to suddenly quiet, at about
10:20 pm. Tuned into Orcasound to see if they went north, but no calls there. Around
11 pm
I heard a few very faint calls from
Lime Kiln hydrophones
- maybe they moved offshore?
Susan Berta & Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island, WA
~10 pm
: Calls clear on
Lime Kiln
. Killer Whale Tales states members of all three pods - you gotta go listen - it's beautiful tonight!!!! No boat noise, and their calls echo.
Vickie Doyle, Kent, WA

10:03 pm
: Lots going on at
Lime Kiln
.

Pod of [
orcas
] passing
Eagle Cove
again

8:20pm
, traveling from the south, lots of breaching, spy hopping, tail-slapping and double breaches rounding Granny's Cove and passing Eagle Point heading north.

The Center for Whale Research went out in several of their research boats to photo ID the new group of Southern Resident orcas who came into the Salish Sea today. They confirmed that members of
L pod
have returned, but seas were choppy and the whales were very spread out, and all the photos haven't been seen yet, and so far all of L pod has not been ID'd. They saw K27 with her new calf, K44, and K27 rolled under her baby and lifted him as CWR photographed, so they were able to see right away that it was a boy!
*
Around
2 pm
this afternoon there were orcas moving quickly with the tide, heading east through
Active Pass
, past us at our Orca Rock. A group of about 8 - 10 led the way, in a resting line for awhile. They were followed at a large distance by a pair and another pair trailed behind them. Cheers,
Karoline Cullen, Galiano Island, BC

We emerged in the
Rosario strait
. A moment later, we saw them:
four orcas
surfaced about 220 yards now off our port side, the eerie fog surrounding them. As we watched the whales, another group surfaced behind us with three more individuals. With the fog, it was difficult to see how many whales there were and in what groupings. Two here, five there; three this way, six more that way! Then all of a sudden, they vanished on a dive. We shut down our engines and waited, each passenger scanning a different direction. When they finally surfaced, there were about twenty orcas together in a tight group, just off our stern! We could hear the poof-poof-poofs of their exhalations. At a glance, we determined that there was a mix of J and L pods, with identifications of a male, "Mega" (L-41), and a female, "Princess Angeline" (J-17). As we were getting our last glimpses of the whales, the fog lifted and we welcomed back the sunshine.

12:00-
12:45
today we had a large and very spread-out group of
orcas
headed west-to-east of Flint Beach,
South Lopez Island
.

~
11:30 am
: We have been watching the [
orcas
] from our spot at
Eagle Cove
for the past 45 minutes. An impressive number of whales, must be at least two pods, possibly all three resident pods. Mamas and babies passing by close in to shore and whales in every direction as far west into the strait and as far south as you can see! Hoping all power boats will be cautious and aware of their presence. Magnificent day, calm water, sun glistening off their backs, and sun rays catching the mist of their blows creating little rainbows!

Early this morning resident
orcas
slowly headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
. I saw the usual leaders, J2 (Granny) and J8 (Speiden) at about

7:25 am
. Orcas continued to trickle past, a few at a time, for nearly an hour. I believe this group of residents included the Js as well as the K13s (and I would assume L87).

[
Orcas
] going past the lighthouse at
Limekiln Park, San Juan Island
, at
7 am
this morning.
Frank-Vicky Giannangelo

Camping at
San Juan County Park
. Saw
J pod
around
7 this morning
. Was fun to step out of the tent and enjoy the ' parade'. There was some breaching and some tails slapping but mostly they were working on heading north. I am assuming they were looking for breakfast.

OrcaSound & Lime Kiln hydrophone reports - am

6:57am
-they really livened up (
calls
at
Lime Kiln
). Loud and a lot of communication. Sweet morning of eavesdropping. Loud calls on
OrcaSound
now. With very little background noise -
7:32am. Echolocation too. J & K- really nice calls, clear and boisterous. They were very audible until about

8:20am
then big boat, then they moved on - happy to listen in on their environment, thanx all who make it possible.
Alisa Lemire Brooks, Shoreline, WA

8:16 am
: Hearing a few
calls
at
Orca Sound
(and boat noise).
Emalie Garcia
Just walked in: hearing ships noise and lots of
calls
6:45 am Lime Kiln
Pacific time.
Suzy Roebling, Key Largo, FL
*
Echolocation
at
Lime Kiln
.

6:11 am
. No calls to identify yet. Lots of echolocation and J calls

6:26 am
. Also loud small boat noise. Interesting how the orcas were quietly foraging until the boat arrived to disturb them. This is exactly what research has found: whales have to shout to communicate over boat noise. K pod is there too.

6:34 am

We had around five
Dall's porpoise
feeding around

7:10
this morning. They were feeding in a bait ball. We are located between
Vashon Island and the Olalla
just up from Al's grocery store. This is our location- N- 47.25.26 W- 122.32.11.5.
