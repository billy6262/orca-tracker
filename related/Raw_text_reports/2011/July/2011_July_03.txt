Orca Sightings for July 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Below reports from Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC
:

5:20 pm
: Between
8 to 10 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
were out in front of the
Powell River
Ferry Terminal foraging then made a decisive turn Southward. They even ignored the ferry wake they normally like to play in.
We also sighted about
7 or 8 pacific white sided dolphins
foraging just North of Hole in the Wall (Calm Channel) - plus, 1 harbour porpoise in Okissolo South - and a couple more in Hoskyns Channel. Wonderful Day,
Jen,
Campbell River
Whale Watching
*
It was a confusing morning -- first
resident orcas
headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
, then south, then north again. Then, the most magical thing took place -- a giant resting line materialized. The orcas
remained in that resting pattern for 5 or 6 hours
, more or less west of Kellett Bluff. I'm not sure how many of the Js and K13s participated (and we cannot forget L87).
