Orca Sightings for February 20, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Liz Lynch called Orca Network to report her husband was in a fishing Derby off Pt. Townsend and took some photos of
orcas
off
Pt. Townsend
around
noon
.
*
We watched several
orcas
(6?) moving from north to south in
Mutiny Bay
on the western side of Whidbey Island. It was between
2 - 3 pm
.

Thanks to reports called and emailed in to us in a timely fashion this morning, we were able to get out with
J pod
for a few hours today. We found them between Indian Island and
Port Townsend
at about
noon
, they then headed down Admiralty Inlet, over toward Bush Pt. Whidbey Island at around
1:55 pm, and we left them at

2:20 pm
off
Mutiny Bay
heading SW toward Double Bluff. They were traveling quickly, only stopping for a few long dives & a few foraging stops (though they had been observed foraging off Ebey's Landing before we got to them) - looked like they were intent on heading into Possession Sound or Puget Sound. We put the hydrophone in 3 or 4 times, but never heard a peep out of them, and Scott Veirs reports no calls were heard on the Pt. Townsend hydrophone. We took well over 1000 photos so are still sifting through them, but have preliminary IDs for:
J2, J8, J14, J16, J17, J22, J26, J27, J28, J30, J32, J34, J37, J42, J44, J46, J47 and L87
(to be confirmed by the Ctr. for Whale Research - and added to as we finish going through our photos). They were traveling in several tight groups most of the time we were with them.

At

4:45
we just watched
3 Orcas
go by
Eglon
heading south in the northbound shipping lanes. None of them looked real big. We are at 47.855741 Lat.122.509712. They are moving rapidly south.

About 15 min. ago @
4pm
from
Edmonds
bluff north of ferry we spotted a few [
orca
] spouts out in
Useless Bay
. Haven't found/seen them again. A sea plane was flying in circles for a while so am sure they are out in that area.

5:10 pm
: seeing blows across Possession Sound. just north of
Kingston
, still heading south.

5:50 pm
: they are just milling and hanging out still north of
Kingston
, no sense which way they'll go. We did see 4-5 harbor porpoise east side of channel heading north. Looking forward to your pictures and our warm house.

Bob Whitney called at

10:14
to report that
6 orcas
just turned south into
Admiralty Inlet
, around Pt. Wilson.

10:35 - Bob Whitney says there are seven in a tight group between
Pt. Wilson and Ebey's Landing
, closer to the Whidbey side. They've slowed down, milling and spyhopping, but still headed slowly south.
He then emailed us: Here are a few of the images of the orca seen today from Point Wilson. It looks like that there was a total of eight orca from what I can see in the image. I always have my eyes open and when I ever see the orca from Point Wilson you are the first ones I call. Thanks for doing the fine work you do on behalf of these wonderful beings.
