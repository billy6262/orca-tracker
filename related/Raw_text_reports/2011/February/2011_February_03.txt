Orca Sightings for February 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report finding the [
orcas
] off
West Seattle
at

5:40 pm
- they were in a tight resting group, close to shore heading north off Me-Kwa-Mooks park. It was too dark to get IDs, but we're pretty sure it's the same groups of Ks and Js that were in Puget Sound yesterday.
*
The West Seattle Blog relayed a report at
noon
of the
orcas
sighted from
Pt. Robinson
and heading north, then again a report of the orcas off the Arroyos,
West Seattle
, at

4:20 pm
- jumping, slapping tails, and a calf were spotted from shore.
*
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called in reports of the [
orcas
] in
Puget Sound
today - at

10:45 am
he had them off the south end of Maury Island, heading south. At

11:50 am Js and Ks
were traveling north off Pt. Robinson. At
1:15 pm he called to say that Js & Ks split into 2 groups around 11 am, & a small group headed N while the large group continued south toward Pt. Definance and Commencement Bay.
*
I saw about
8 orcas
from the lookout at the s end of
Vashon
around
10 am
this morning. They were feeding, and breaching and spyhopping- quite a show! They seemed to be heading west, but disappeared underwater for awhile. Then I noticed a few on the surface which were facing east. So, maybe they were just milling around, or they had changed directions. There seemed to be at least 2 small whales with the big guys.

Amy Carey relayed a report at
10 AM
this morning from
Vashon Island
of
orcas
headed south off Maury Island, just south of Pt. Robinson. Sounds like they're finding something they like down there.
*
Cheri Bush called from
Depoe Bay, OR
at
11 AM
to report at least
7 orcas
about a mile off shore traveling south, including one big male.
*
Orca Network received a call at

10:08 AM
from Gary Archambeau in
Depoe Bay, OR
reporting at least
12 orcas
heading south, a mile offshore, including one big male.
*
A pod of about 10-12 common or
pacific white sided dolphins
(could see patterns but couldn't see their beaks well enough to tell) between the Mission Bay channel jetty and the Ocean Beach pier eating and milling. AND we had a
CA Gray whale
spout just off the pier at about
7:30 AM. I wish I could have taken the day off and hit the water because the visibility was outstanding with the Santa Anna's blowing. I could see all the way to Dana Point from Dog Beach (Ocean Beach). For the Whales!

The
bottlenose dolphin
that was sighted around southern
Puget Sound
most recently on 18 January at Nisqually was reported dead at Nisqually earlier this week. It was in a difficult to access location so could not be recovered until late yesterday and a necropsy is being performed today by WDFW and Cascadia personnel. I do not have any results as of yet.
