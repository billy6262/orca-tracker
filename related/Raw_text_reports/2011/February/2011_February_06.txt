Orca Sightings for February 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the ferry Rhododendron from
Point Defiance
, around

11:15am
, the ferry captain announced there were
orcas
off the port side. There were at least 2 males with the big dorsal fin and maybe 5 or 6 females and I think at least one calf or smaller one. They were not far from the Tahlequah ferry dock and it was an amazing sight. The Rhododendron backed off to give them space to pass in front of the dock and then they were gone. They seemed to be heading north. They were maybe a 100 yards from the ferry.

6:30pm
: Just saw multiple blows off
Bremerton ferry
as were approaching
Seattle
. Too dark to see, but definitely whale blows (looked like at least 2 individuals).

And yet another exciting day with the
Orca
. First from Me-Kwa-Mooks park (
West Seattle
) after waiting a few hours for their arrival, we were finally rewarded with a pod of
5-6 Orca
at

4:20pm
mid channel heading north towards
Alki point
. Included a mature male, few females and/or young males and a little one. We headed over to the south side of Alki point where they continued traveling north at a good pace. They rounded Alki a few hundred yards off shore and headed east directly into
Elliot Bay
. A few spy hops,tail slaps & breaches on the way in but once they traveled well into the bay (and I mean well in) we were treated to a succession of multiple breaches, spyhops, cartwheels, tail lobs, and belly ups (not sure the technical term). They were having a grand time and it was quite an exciting display. When we left at

5:45pm
-ish they were deep in Elliot Bay. From Hamilton Viewpoint Park (West Seattle) we could sight-line them at approx. mid Myrtle Edwards Park between the shore and the ferry lane. We didn't see them again once the ferry left port and passed.

Members of
J pod
including a juvenile just entered
Elliott Bay
(at least east of a line between Duwamish Head (W Seattle) and the Grainery (Interbay). Once they got out of the wind waves there was a lot of breaching, including by the juvenile. This is the first entrance into Elliott Bay that Jeff Hogan and I have heard of.

I finally decided to head down to Emma Schmitz Memorial Viewpoint along Beach DR SW in
West Seattle
for a look-see. Maybe around

4:15-
4:30
finally spotted some blows & fins. There was a small boat motoring south quite fast and they suddenly stopped. That alerted us and Donna quickly spotted them. [
Orcas
] were about mid-channel between WS and Blake Island. They were steadily making their way north and could even been seen without binoculars. I think there were about 8 of them. Looked to be a couple of males and at least one smaller one.

Approx.

A small group of
orcas
headed north near

Appeared to be transients.
Jane Cogan, San Juan Island

Transient orcas
were spotted heading up
Haro Strait
at

3:00 pm
. They were close to a mile offshore. Earlier I had heard what I thought was one faint call on the Lime Kiln hydrophones, but nothing more. At least 4 fins up at one time and it looked as if there might be a couple others, but not sure. However, they were definitely transients.
