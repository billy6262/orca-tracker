Orca Sightings for February 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We sighted a small group of
orcas
at
1730
, from our porch. Estimate 8-12 whales total, 2 males, coming from Agate Pass, rounding Bolin Point, headed towards Liberty Bay in
Poulsbo
WA. They were traveling at a slow speed, about 100 yds offshore, and did not appear to be feeding. We've lived here 12 years and have seen a couple of single whales pass by but never seen any orcas. Maybe they are following the early chum run(?).

Thanks to the email from Peg Boley (see report below), we looked out our window wondering how far north up
Saratoga Passage
the
orcas
had come - it was

4:25 pm
, and rain and clouds had moved up the passage. But as we picked up our binoculars and looked out our office window, we saw fins within minutes, right off North Bluff, north of
Greenbank
! We watched until they passed by -

5:15 pm
, then tried to find them again further north but the darkness prevented any further sightings. We saw possibly 2 males, a mom/babe pair, and several other females/juveniles. They were heading predominately north, but made many direction changes, lunges, and behaviors that looked to us like Resident salmon-chasing behaviors. However, they were too distant to get any good ID photos (but see Peg Boley's photo here), but these are likely some of the J and K pod orcas that have been in Puget Sound the past two days, possibly split up into several groups around Puget Sound today - but no confirmation on IDs at this time.

Roger Clark called Orca Network at

4:50 pm
to say he was watching a pod of at least 3
orcas
from Whidbey Shores, near East Pt.,
Saratoga Passage
, heading north.

At

2:30
this afternoon, we were thrilled to see a group of
orcas
come by our bank, which we have never seen before. We life on the south end of Camano Island (on Saratoga Passage), and have seen them in the past over by Langley on Whidbey Island. There were a group of about 5 or 6, with two smaller (juveniles?) following behind. They were moving quickly. This is the same place we saw an orca attack on a grey whale last year.

1:30 PM
- Dwight Leisle called to say he saw about 5
orcas
in
Sinclair Inlet
at the head of Washington Narrows, heading east.
*

10:10 am
: Anna Alandia called from just north of Ilahee to report 3
orcas
heading north in the south end of
Port Orchard Bay
.
*
Orca Network received a call from John Rogstad at WA State Ferries, with a report of 4
orcas
observed from the Kaleetan ferry out of
Bremerton
- the orcas were just off E. Bremerton and Waterman Pt, off the S. end of Bainbridge Island, heading west at

9:10 am
. Update from WSF at

9:44 am
: the whales seem to be going south, moving further into Sinclair Inlet - they received a report from the Naval Shipyard there!
