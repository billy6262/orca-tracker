Orca Sightings for February 2, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I did not have a good view of the
orcas
that swam from Tongue Point west across
Crescent Bay, west of Port Angeles
. I saw two blowing at the same time, but there could have been more. The dorsal fins in the blows looked very tall even at the distance I was viewing them.

At around

12:50 pm
I saw one
orca
by Ruston Way in
Tacoma
. Another whale watcher said they saw the entire pod and a small research boat. He said the whales seemed to be heading towards the Vashon Island Ferry in Pt. Defiance Park. I saw only the one whale and only for a split second.

I wanted to report that I observed at least
2 orcas
off of Dash Point (
Tacoma
Parks) shortly after 11 a.m. for a period of about 40 minutes. I'd say time was

11:15 a.m. to about noon
. During a 40 minute period, I saw at least 2 of them (at least 2x I saw 2 separate fins breach at the same time), at least 1 of which was a male due to the huge dorsal fin. There were at least 2 orcas, maybe 1 or 2 more. I heard and observed multiple "blows" as they were surfacing for air. I believe they were hunting salmon. I saw them range from a few yards North of the Dash Point pier up North toward Des Moines for several hundred yards, then head South again back toward the pier. Most of this time they were 400-600 yards off shore. However, when they headed South toward Tacoma, they came in closer to the shore, one briefly came in as close as 200 yards about 100 yards or so South of the pier. I lost sight of them as they headed South toward Tacoma, as the beach at the park is only about 500 yards or so, and they headed too far South to see. I'm pretty sure, but not positive, they were hunting salmon. There were a lot of seals in the area, some of which were just a few yards from the pier. I'd say I'm 70% convinced they were chasing salmon, but not positive.

I was at Dash Point (
Tacoma
City Parks) on the beach shortly after
11 a.m.
I was on the beach about 50 yards North of the Pier (right next to THE LOBSTER SHOP) and observed at least 2
orcas
over a period of about 40 minutes. I'm pretty sure at least one of the 2 was a male due to the large, vertical dorsal fin I saw. I believe there were at least 2 orcas, although there could have been more--I did clearly see 2 separate fins breach at least twice. I observed them primarily about 400 to 600 yards off shore North of the Dash Point pier, but they did turn around and eventually head South of the pier, where one of them came within about 200 yards. They then appeared to continue heading South toward Tacoma, where they went out of view (the park shoreline is less than 600 yards or so, and they went too far South to observe). I believe they were hunting salmon. One reason I stayed around so long is I wasn't sure if they were transients or offshores who were hunting seals, and they were a multitude of seals in the area.

to say they were with a mix of
Js and Ks
off the south end of
Vashon Island
- the whales went down to the entrance to Colvos Passage, grouped up a bit more then headed toward the east and Brown's Pt. Then he called back 10 minutes later to say they'd turned around and were heading back up into Colvos Passage. They had obtained a fish scale sample from J28 foraging.

The HARBOR RANGER, a Ranger Tug 25 was cruising across by
Pt. Defiance
about

12:30
today. We saw a couple of boaters then saw several fins - turned out to be at least 20 or more
Orcas
, adults and several babies cruising in Commencement Bay between the Tacoma Yacht Club and Vashon Ferry run. They seemed to come down West pass and go around the end of Vashon - then headed back up Colvos. We enjoyed watching them for about 1 and Â½ hours - beautiful and majestic and awesome!!!!
