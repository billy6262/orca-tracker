Orca Sightings for February 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I viewed some video footage from KQED News from an [
orca
] encounter 10-12 miles West of the
Golden Gate bridge
. Looked to me like L95, L77, L94 and L113 were present.

My cousin & I saw
orcas
off
Laguna Beach, CA
! As we sat on the beach, we saw two groups go by offshore about ten minutes apart. Both groups had at least three orcas in them.

Watched the
orcas
from about

5:30-
6:00
as they rounded
Alki Point
. They were pretty close to shore. Saw one spyhop. I'd say there were about 6 of them in a tight group. Watched for a bit along Harbor Ave as it looked like a couple may have headed for Elliott Bay again, but no luck. Just too darn dark.

Yeah, it was definitely getting dark, but it looked like the [
orcas
] that went past
Alki
may have split up. Some kept going north, while a few turned east. I tried near Anchor park, then again closer to Salty's but no luck.

My hubby reported seeing the
orcas
off the south side of the lighthouse on
Alki
~

5:50 pm
. Apparently, they got close enough the onlookers could hear them breathing. Some may have been headed towards downtown.

The
orcas
are heading north past
West Seattle
. Only about 6 of them. I saw them from the Vashon ferry at

3:25pm
and now from West Seattle at

5:30pm
. I was able to watch them from my place up high north of Lincoln Park right off Lowman Beach.

4:24 pm
: they're still off to the NE of Dolphin Point - between Vashon and Lincoln Park and still heading N. one would have a great view from a ferry ride right now!

My family and I saw them just south of
Alki
point. Being British and new to Seattle, this was our first, real life sighting of
Orca
and we were utterly blown away :)

had a great time watching the
orcas
from shore on
Alki Pt.
- they were as close as they could get, plus the tide was out, and we were as close as we could get - it was beyond awesome :)

Orca Network received two more reports of the
orcas
in Puget Sound this afternoon. John Rogstad from WSF called saying orcas were frolicking near the ferry lanes (
Fauntleroy-Vashon
) around
2 pm

J-pod
was traveling slowly north towards the
Vashon ferry
, mid channel, at

3:35 pm.

Orca Network received two new reports from Amy Carey of
orca
, first near Dilworth (
Vashon Island
) around
