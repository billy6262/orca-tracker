Orca Sightings for February 13, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I came across members of
J pod
in the
afternoon
4 miles south of
Victoria
harbour north east bound. I was able to confirm
J17, J22, J27, J28, J31, J34, J35, J38, J39, J44, J46, and J47
. They spent the afternoon foraging against the ebb current and looked as though they were finding a lot of fish in the area. I left them at
1515
hrs pointed east for Trial Island within a mile of Victoria's waterfront.

J Pod
, heading east toward
San Juan Island
. We got to spend about 45 minutes with them, to the delight of my passengers, and Jeanne Hyde. We didn't see J1, but he wouldn't have been with these Js.

On Maya's Westside Charters, at

1:42pm
we encountered three family groups of J pod (I call them Group B) the
J11s, J22s, and the J17s
. All members of those three family groups were present. We left them eastbound near
Victoria
at

2:25pm
.

) off
Victoria

Out for a walk along Dallas Road (
Victoria
, BC) tonight and saw
two Orca's
off in the distance, Not sure if they were transients or locals but enjoyed the moment none the less.

At

3:48
, from home, I picked up
Transient calls
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. I saw two transients appearing to be traveling west to east, several miles to the south, between Discovery Island and Beaumont Shoals marker. After driving south to get a better look, they were spotted south and west of the Beaumont Shoals marker heading south, last seen at about

4:30 pm
. I will be posting pictures on my blog.

My family and I saw a pod of
orcas
traveling just off the
Narrow's Bridge
and traveling under it at sunset. There was at least one whale that I think was a large male. It had about a 3 foot fin. Several others looked like females and young ones.

I saw some

today at

Another report of 3 "fins" about 1.5 miles south of the Southworth Ferry on the Kitsap side, called in by Robert Minor at
2:24 pm.
*
I was able to take the boat out from Gig Harbor and head up to
Blake Island
. Just as I was nearing the southern side of Blake, I spotted four
Orcas
heading south. They followed the WST Ferry into Southworth and swam back and forth just off
Southworth
dock for about 20 minutes. Then, just a little further south they stopped again and began the back and forth. I left them about

2:15
and they were continuing south toward Frageria. Nice calm water for their journey.

I saw the
orcas
to the right of the
southworth
ferry dock in the

2:00
hour.

We saw
orcas
about

1:30 pm
or so. We were headed south to
Des Moines
Marina. Initially, we thought we saw three dorsal fins; it looked like a male, female and calf but they were very far away. Then they disappeared resurfacing on the west side of the passage off Vashon Island. In one of the pictures, it looks like there might be four. In two of the shots you can see Seattle in the background (see above photo). When we first spotted them they were about 500 yards away on the port side of the boat and headed south. They then took a 90 degree turn behind us and crossed the passage toward Vashon Island. We heard that some other boaters spotted whales near Southworth, Vashon on the same day. Not sure if these are the same ones.

1:20 pm
- Amy Carey called to report seeing
orcas
at the
Southworth
Ferry dock, heading south in
Colvos Passage
. She then wrote: Still in colvos passage just about a mile south of southworth ferry. Foraging very close inshore - my gps map tells me they are right at the beach at cisco road.
2pm.
Had a few hours with the whales yesterday as they moved Slowly south down colvos. They were so close to the Kitsap side - lots of folks on the beach got a good show! I left them as they were just about at Ollala on the Kitsap side. Found a facebook post this morning that reported them near the Narrows Bridge yesterday but didn't give a time. Wondering if they went deep south?
