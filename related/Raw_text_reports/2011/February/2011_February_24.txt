Orca Sightings for February 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here are photos of the
Orca
we sighted last Thursday off
Monterey CA
aboard the Sanctuary. It is not CA60 "Canopener" per the photo that Alisa sent. Any clues on the ID of this big guy? More to come.

We a had a great sighting of a very large male
orca
off of Point Pinos,
Monterey Bay
. It had a noticeable notch in the lower trailing edge of his dorsal fin. A very tall dorsal fin - 5-6 feet with a wide base. I had camera problems so am awaiting the photos from passengers that are promised. Will send them along as I receive them. He was solo and buzzed our boat several times. At one point he came right under the water (which was quite clear that day) along the length of our boat, surfacing within a few feet of our bow. It was very exciting! I'm the new owner of Sanctuary Cruises and will send you reports of any orca sightings we have!
