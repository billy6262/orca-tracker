Port Susan
, between east Camano Island and the mainland. They were off Warm Beach at ~

Chris Kennedy of WA State Ferries called Orca Network to report
~6 orcas
half way between the
Mukilteo and Clinton
Ferry docks at

9:25 am
, milling around, and possibly heading north.
*
Orca Network received a call from Veronica von Allworden who observed
4 orcas
from the
9 am Clinton - Mukilteo
ferry - at first it appeared they were traveling north in Possession Sound, then she called back at
9:25 am to say there were 6 orcas (1 with a calf), and they were then spread out between Clinton & mid-channel, milling, with no direction of travel.
*
I just sighted at least
five orcas
in the middle of the passage between the
Mukilteo/Clinton
ferry docks. We were on the ferry and they were quite close. It looked like two males and a female with a juvenile, and one farther off closer to the Whidbey shore was too far away to tell. Males were doing some modest thrashing around, looked like hunting behavior. The time was
9am
. They seemed to be heading slowly south.

9 a.m.
this morning I spotted at least
3-4 orcas
just past the
mukilteo
ferry dock headed toward Hat island.

Very exciting to see a large pod of
Orcas
pass by the house this morning! Seen in
Possession Sound
traveling north past Possession Point State Park at about

8:15am
. We had counted about 9 when a boat drove to the middle of the pod and disrupted them so we estimate there were between 10 and 15 whales, maybe between 2-3 males.!
