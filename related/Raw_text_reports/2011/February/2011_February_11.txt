Orca Sightings for February 11, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
T30
and family group were off the
Victoria
waterfront, at

2:15pm
traveling slowly east. They were also in foraging mode! We watched the female T30 and her family members dispatch a Harbour Porpoise. Meanwhile, the big male T30A, had moved off on his own. We found him later with his own afternoon snack. As our skipper 'Mark Malleson ' stated yesterday on OrcaNetwork, it was thought a harbour seal might have been on the menu.

I came across the
T030's
in the
afternoon
east bound south of
Victoria
. T030A was separated a mile to the north when the rest of the group chased and killed a harbor porpoise, On my way home I found T030A two miles north of the group snacking on what smelled like a seal.
