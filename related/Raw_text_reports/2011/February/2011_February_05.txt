I live on a bluff in
Mukilteo
and observed a pod of
Orca
last
night
. They were feeding in a pod of 8-10 apps. a half mile off the ferry dock in Mukilteo, heading north toward Gedney (Hat) Island around dusk. Regards,

We were at the dedication of the new Rosehill Community Center in
Mukilteo
this afternoon to hear our grandson's band. As soon as they were finished, around

4:30
, the announcer got on the mike and said we had more guests. There were several
orcas
out front and heading north.

First caught sight of 6-7 [
orcas
] in a tight group traveling south off
Whidbey
toward mid channel between
Cultus Bay & Point no Point
. They foraged out there for a while then headed back towards Whidbey, now in 2 groups numbering at least a dozen. (We are assuming two groups met up out there in the middle). They continued north up the channel towards Mukilteo in a resting line headed across the channel right towards us at the Mukilteo Beach/boat ramp. One would spyhop, followed by the pod surfacing, then they would travel along for a few minutes then dive for 3-4 minutes. They repeated this as they continued past us (and a growing, awe struck crowd). At this point we counted
at least 15 Orca
as they continued Northeasterly towards
Everett
. Out in the bay they made a U-turn and traveled back south, where they continued mid channel, past Mukilteo when we left them

4:30ish
.

LeeAnne Soule called to report sing a pod of 10+
orcas
including a calf, in
Possession Sound
off S. Whidbey Island around

1:30 - 2 pm
Sunday, heading north. She also saw a pod of porpoise, heading south, at the same time.

Alisa and Ed Brooks looked for the
orcas
today and were rewarded with sightings at the following locations and times:

4:50 pm:
the orcas were still heading south in
Possession Sound
, heading toward the SW end of Whidbey Island.

4:27 pm:
back at
Mukilteo
they are heading south thru possession sound, mid. Channel right about in the ferry lane.

3:51pm:
they are out in the middle between
Hat island
and Mukilteo general direction heading west towards Saratoga Passage.

3:11pm:
they're in heading towards
Everett
, probably off around Howarth park area. Sorry, not as far as Howarth. Somewhere east of Mukilteo tho. We are up at Harborview park everett and cannot see them, may be they are closer in than we can see from here.

2:50 pm:
they just passed right in front of
Mukilteo
ferry landing whoo hoo.

2:15 pm:
we are at
Mukilteo
now, Looks like a resting line still heading north up the channel towards us.

1:30 pm:
the whales turned around and were off
Possession Pt
, heading north up Possession Sound toward Clinton.

1:20 pm:
right at the entrance to
Cultus Bay
, South Whidbey.

1:05 pm:
still milling mid channel, definitely a dozen. Questionable behavior by a fishing boat.

12:45 pm:
up to a dozen milling mid channel between
Point no Point
and Cultus Bay. Maybe some from both groups have hooked up.

12:30 pm:
observed the orcas between
Point No Point
, N. KItsap Peninsula, & Double Bluff, SW Whidbey Island, heading toward the Pt. No Point Lighthouse, but they are still unsure whether they will go out Admiralty or back into Puget Sound.
Thanks to Dave Ellifrit from the Center for Whale Research, we have the following IDs from Alisa Brooks' many wonderful photos of J and K pods off Mukilteo on Saturday:

I saw a pod of
killer whales
swimming northward from the shoreline about 1 mile north of the
Mukilteo
ferry landing at about

3:05 pm
today. I counted 8 individuals including 2 adult males swimming very close together about 400-500 m. offshore. They were close enough to the shore that I could hear them exhale. I watched them heading north for about 5 minutes, after which they could no longer be seen on the surface.

The two groups of
orcas
have joined up together again - John Rogstad at WA State Ferries called at

2:54 pm
to report ~20 orcas frolicking off the
Mukilteo
Ferry dock, surrounding the ferry! This definitely sounds like the Js & Ks, now back in one larger pod, and heading north from Mukilteo.
*
Bob Hollander of South Whidbey Island called at
noon
to report a pod of 4+
orcas
spread out between
So. Whidbey Island
and Mukilteo, between Possession Pt. and Glendale, heading south. A few boats were near them, two of them following too closely.
*

11:50 am
- Laura Nance from Possession Pt. State Park on
SW Whidbey
Island reports 5
orcas
, including 1 calf heading south quickly off the park - maybe heading to Seattle?
*

11:35 am
- 4
orcas
, including 1 calf, seen in
Possession Sound
, half way between the ferry lanes & the south tip of Whidbey Island, heading south - reported by Arlene Brumm of Mukilteo.

Sandra Pollard called Orca Network at

11:15 am
- she saw 2
orcas
from the
Mukilteo
ferry landing - they were between Mukilteo and Hat Island, heading toward Whidbey Island.
*
About

8:30 am
we saw a group of
orcas
once again, this time out in the middle of Saratoga Passage. They were too far away to tell how many there were, and we think they were heading over closer to Langley.

Veronica von Allworden of Langley, Whidbey Island called Orca Network at

8:25 am
to report 3 - 4
orcas
off
Camano Head
, Camano Island, heading south.
*
Just read yesterdays Orca Net report of orca in Saratoga Passage. That may have been what I saw/heard just after
8 AM
. There was a "large" white circular pattern in the water off the bluff. Out in the middle of
Saratoga Passage
, I heard/saw something with fins roll. I thought possibly dolphin, but may have been
orca
.
