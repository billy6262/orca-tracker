Orca Sightings for February 10, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of the endangered group of
Resident Killer Whales
were spotted by Monterey Bay Whale Watch, headed into
Monterey Bay
along the deep submarine canyon. The group consisted of "
L Pod
" a family group of 40 individuals, part of the population of Southern Residents consisting of J, K and L pods.
*
My name is Mike Jones, I work for the Port Gamble S'klallam tribe. While collecting samples for dissolved oxygen we came upon a pod of
Orca
. they were in the
Hood canal
off Hoods Head, north of the hood Canal bridge. after observing them for awhile they looked as though they headed north out of the Hood Canal.
*
Orca Network received a call from Den, on the
Hood Canal
side of Hansville, reporting a pod of
orcas
from

4:45 -
5:15 pm
, between Hood Head and Hood Canal Drive. There was 1 male, 4 - 5 females, and a juvenile. At
5:15 pm they were heading north out of the inlet.
*

4:15 pm
: I was walking along the beach on the
Hood Canal
side of the Hansville area this afternoon. There are often harbor porpoise in this area of Hood Canal, and sure enough a pod of about 10 surfaced nearby. Normally, they mill around and feed, but today they surfaced a couple times and were gone. I was scanning the calm water looking to see where they went. To my great surprise, the next fins I saw rise out of the water were
Orcas
! It is very unusual to see Orcas in Hood Canal, but there they were blowing their puffs of "steam". There were two males and a female heading south passed Hood Head. 5 minutes later I spotted a female and a small Juvenile following the first three. The female and Juvenile were swimming very closely together, surfacing nearly at the same time. I watched them for about 20 minutes as they swam down towards Port Gamble and the bridge.

Just came back (

4:39 pm
) from watching
10-12 orca
north of
Foulweather Bluff
, way way across from Mutiny Bay. Sandra Pollard first spotted the spouts, then we both watched them for almost an hour - until a submarine came by and we lost track of them, somewhere by the entrance to Hood Canal. Too far for any ID's unfortunately.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called at
11 am
with a report of
orcas
off the west side of
Whidbey Island
, Useless Bay area, probably heading north.
*
This morning at

6:45
I stood out on my porch NW of
Langley
and listened to three or four whales (maybe more maybe less??) blow every few minutes. They were closer to Camano than Whidbey Island. The blows sounded like
orcas
(as apposed to grays or Dall's). It just was not light enough out to see them. I could not tell which direction they headed off in.
