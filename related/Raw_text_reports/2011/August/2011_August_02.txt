Orca Sightings for August 2, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted 2 Orca just off Mack Arch rock south of
Crook Point in Oregon
at about

10:30 a.m
. We have stayed at this particular location many times and have found that it is a haven for summer resident gray whales. This year we observed a juvenile gray whale each day traveling north and south to the inside of the sea stacks where there is good protection from rough waters and predators. The grays have remained in this general area feeding for days at a time during our stays. Our sighting lasted less than 10 min and they disappeared behind the large rock and were not viewed again by us.

We saw what looks to be the same L subgroup. At

3:45 pm
near
Hannah Heights
area we were watching first 5 Orca (1 adult male, 3 females and a youngin) heading steadily south. Once they passed, another adult male and a female followed quite a distance behind. I almost think this male looks like L41 so look forward to any reports from the boats for all the ID's. All 7 were mostly foraging and slow moving south, with a few tail slaps, porpoising and one spyhop. We watched them from the bluff until

5:30pm
. From

6:00-
7:00pm
we watched them from
South Beach
, mostly foraging and moving east, then west, then east, then west. When we left them they were heading pretty steadily west. Maybe another day, they will come back in close to the lighthouse.

We received a call from Marlene Wagenheim of Florida, reporting
an orca she saw 3-400 yards off the beach in New Smyrna Beach, Florida
(about 40 miles northeast of Orlando) at 2pm. She didn't think it was an adult male. It breached 3 times. She said she heard others had been seen there a few weeks ago, but she couldn't find a reliable report.
