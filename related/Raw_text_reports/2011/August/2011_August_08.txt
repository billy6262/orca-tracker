Orca Sightings for August 8, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
(by Grants Reef off of Savary Island). Nick told me that they were
last seen (
August 13) off Campbell River
, headed south. It is SO exciting that Nick saw CA24 and N25 off the Campbell River! NICE images.

My husband and I were walking the
South Beach
, San Juan Island around

1:30pm
and spotted
2 Orcas swimming West
. We walked over to a secluded group of rocks on the same beach and
watched a very large pod of about 20 - 25 Orcas
, including 1 large male with an intense dorsal fin protruding in and out of the water. The entire scene was mindblowing. We then drove to a lookout point about
a mile East of the Lime Kiln State Park
, crawled on a lower group of rocks and watched the same pod come through. We watched them breach and lobtail. Such amazing creatures. The only bothersome part of the entire viewing experience was the fact that every time a whale popped out of the water, a crowd of whale watching ships stalked the whale and pod. This was our first trip to San Juan Island but definitely not the last.

Something rare occurred today; killer whales surprised us by coming up not only next to our boat, but a couple swam under our boat! We headed around Cattle Point to the
west side of San Juan Island
. This is where we saw the orcas. There was a small group of three that were close to land. We stopped or boat to watch when one big male changed direction and the next thing we knew he swam right across our bow. I was able to identify him as
Blackberry (J27)
. Then more killer whales started coming to us from both directions. We watched them tail slapping and milling around, and we even saw
the new K-calf (K44) with his mother Deadhead (K27)
. Then, out of nowhere a group of 4 whales went around and under the boat next to us and then two swam under our boat! It was incredible! On the other side when they came up I was able to identify
Mike (J26)
. This was the closest encounter I've had! What a great summer afternoon.

This morning between

11:15 and
11:30
[
orcas
] headed south past
Lime Kiln
in a large, fast-moving group. When they were still a mile or more to the north they started getting very active - I think I saw about 15 breaches in the span of about 30 seconds! I've never seen them quite go off like that before. They settled down a little bit by the time they reached the lighthouse, but we still saw several breaches, spyhops, and tailslaps. I saw members from every matriline in J-Pod plus L87, but there were so many whales I think at least some of K-Pod was present, too.

Entry 2:
Very unusual sighting today...a
humpback
! It was right on the
west side of San Juan Island
. We saw the spout followed by its large back. We watched for a while and were able to see it go down for two deeper dives, arching its back and exposing its fluke. Plus, when it exhaled, it sounded like it was wheezing because it made a high pitched, scratchy sound. That wasn't all that we saw today. We saw a
minke whale
, not so far from where we spotted the humpback.
