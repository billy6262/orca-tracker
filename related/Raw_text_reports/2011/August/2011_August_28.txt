Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reports encountering the
T100s from Bell Island, WA to Tumbo Island, BC
, on their way to Active Pass.

I just came in from the deck and an hour of "whale watching" from my porch. There were a
t least 6. They were coming out of Budd Inlet
- right near Boston Harbor. They were traveling north along that eastern shore. So, I'm looking at them from a distance of two inlets. They have now made their way north through
Dana Passage
- where I lost sight of them after they rounded the corner of Harstene Island.

At about

7:30 pm - in Tacoma
, about 1/2 mile north of the
Narrows Bridge
- heading north towards Point Defiance. Saw
at least 8-10
- they were moving rapidly and jumping - we could see the dorsal fins and their heads above the water. We have lived here for over 4 years and have not seen Orcas here before. A Coast Guard boat was about 3/4 mile behind them.

Yesterday at

3:30 PM
I observed a group of
10-15 orcas in the vicinity of Boston Harbor
, including at least one male. The animals were moving toward the East in strong currents.

@

7:30 pm
. Latitude, Longitude: 47.277831,-122.541504 A group of
10-12 Orcas traveling North under the Narrows Bridge
. We have never spotted whales here. Were they maybe feeding down at the Nisqually Delta on seals? Spotted them from our Deck at 3016 N. Narrows Dr. Tacoma, WA 98407

We saw them at about

5:30-ish
as they were heading out toward
Henderson Inlet
. We counted
at least six, maybe as many as eight
including a very young
orca
. They were moving fairly fast so I just kept snapping photos. The sheriff boat here yesterday may have a better count. We called them to thank their effort. They were not in the bay here for very long.

We were thrilled yesterday to spot
4 whales
right in front of our cabin property in
Case Inlet
, WA. It was a sighting of a lifetime. My grandfather who has been going to the cabin for over 80 years said he has never seen any orcas in the area. It was wonderful!!

3:10pm
- My friend just said they were breaching like mad out at Burfoot Park, here in
Olympia near Boston Harbor
. Now they're headed toward Woodard Bay....and so are my friends!

About 10
or so sighted going south past
Boston Harbor Lighthouse
just after

2:00 pm
this afternoon. They turned around and headed north
around
2:15pm
. Did a show for all the fleet following them (at an appropriate distance) for at least an hour as they headed through Dana Passage. At one point they split into two groups. There were some young ones in the front group and it was almost as if some of the adults were doing a sweep to make sure everyone moved forward safely. They did some breaches, but mostly surfaced and swam forward. One or maybe two of the smaller ones appeared to try doing flips. What an experience.

We saw
4 Orcas
today, at about
noon
. We were looking east from Herron Island and the whales passed traveling
southbetween Herron and Hartstein Islands
. First, the largest one breached twice and got our attention, only about 20 yards from shore. About a minute later 3 more passed by, close together, breaching several times. Two appeared to be smaller than the first and the third seemed much smaller. They just continued swimming east at a pretty good pace.

On Maya's Westside Charters at about

3:45 p.m.
in the
Strait of Georgia
we had an encounter with the
T100s
. It appeared they had made a kill and were having a meal. There was some exciting surface action including a double spyhop - one whale facing us and the other facing the other way. Included here is either T100E or T100B1 caught on camera in the middle of an exuberant breach. For more pictures and the story see my blog: Whale of A Purpose - 8-28 'Doing A Double Take'

5:30 or 6pm
- we spotted a group of about
5 or six at the south end of Anderson
. We moved into Oro Bay to fish and found at least 3 young looking whales playing and swimming up to boats fishing in the bay. All boats in the bay stopped to watch as the whales played for about 30 minutes before heading out toward Ketron Island. We left Oro Bay at
7pm
and headed back toward Narrows Marina. We caught up with a large group heading north just off of
Steilacoom
. It was hard to count them but we estimate there were
around a dozen
. We followed them for about an hour as they continued to make their way north following the Tacoma side shoreline heading north toward Tacoma. We finally passed the group near Day Island. They were playing, breaching, jumping, tail slapping. There was at least one very large whale that seemed to be leading the parade on Sunday.
