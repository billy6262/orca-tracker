Northern Resident Orca
A number of Resident Orca were headed East by Cracroft Point and by
9:30 am some had made it into the Bight. The A11's, A8's and A23's for sure. Some Orca made it West to Beaver Cove and back towards the Bight.

4 Orca
(assumed to be
Transients
) were just outside Spring Passage, the Broughton's, in northern BC.
