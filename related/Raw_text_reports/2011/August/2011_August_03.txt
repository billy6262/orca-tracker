Orca Sightings for August 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fab morning with
J's and K's
!! J34's getting bigger each time I see him. Was lovely to see K21, and his interesting new nick! and J27 was much fun in the afternoon with his inverted swimming!

We headed north into
Canadian waters
to find the
killer whales
. Three of them came up on us, about one hundred yards away! It was K pod; we were able to identify Cappuccino. We watched them slowly move near shore and meet up with other whales. As we were watching the whales, salmon began to jump out of the water.

Sitting here at
San Juan County park
. The
Orca
were at LK earlier and passed by here about an hour ago (
noon
). First heard what I thought was K pod on Lime Kiln hydrophone around
11:00 am. Overheard someone here saying it was J and some K's. Several groups travelling thru steadily north with some breaches. They continued up the north end of the island out of sight. Very appreciative that J & K pod journeyed back along San Juan Island.
