Orca Sightings for August 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient orcas
off Patos Island (to NW of lighthouse) Friday morning. These transients made a harbor porpoise kill. Given the notch in the dorsal fin this orca might be identified. (The male below looks like
T20
, as seen in the Photo ID Guide to Transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska.)

Three orca
were in our bay about
6pm
, between the
two Illahee docks
. The whales continued to head north, then turned back south and headed into
Rich Passage to Bremerton
. They seemed to pass north up Port Orchard bay freely.

We were lucky enough to see
three Orcas
come through
Rich Passage
today at

4:30pm
. Two were together (male and female) and one appeared to be on its own. They were heading west toward Bremerton in mid-channel. Note:
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research ID'd the male as California transient CA20, and added "We saw both these whales on the 25th."
Doug Miller

Orca

over a dozen
. Saw 8 breach at one time and others right before and after. Near center of commencement bay
near tacoma
traveling in towards puyallup river, then turned south, then west towards point defiance

1:15-
1:45pm
. At the time lots of fishermen out at browns point. some caught pink [humpies] salmon. They were swimming and breeching for most of the 20-30 min.

Two orcas (mother and calf?)
Moving west from

.
James and Deborah Ellis

12:19
- My son is on the south end of
Maury Island
, near Sandy Shores, and can see the
orcas
, still heading south quickly out in the middle of the sound. My wife also sees them, and says she only sees about a half-dozen fins. Maybe they're mostly underwater, but maybe the larger group has split up?

11am
- Per Linda Henley 10 minutes ago, they were straight east from
Dilworth Point on Vashon Island
, but on the mainland side. That puts them at Seahurst,
Burien
. Per Amy Carey, nearing Three Tree Point southbound on Seattle/Burien side.

11:05
- from Arroyo neighborhood, finally spotted the Orca off
Three Tree Pt

Orcas
at
three tree point
at

10:45

Preserve Our Islands
*

10:14am
- There are
about 20 Orcas
swimming
between Vashon and West Seattle
, now making their way down to Maury. One research boat, several yahoos trailing closely. Appears to be two big males and lots of females. Very exciting! Surfaced around
10 am
, or that's when we noticed them.
Meg Halverson
*
10am
- Woke to see a pod of
9 to 14 Orca Whales
swimming right in front of me
between West Seattle & Vashon Island
. A blessing I have waited long for. It is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen or heard. The sound of their breath is simply beautiful. They were headed south, fishing.

As of

9:49am
, this from West Seattle Blog Admin: "JUST got a call from Jeff of Killer Whale Tales - they have just passed
Brace Point,
still heading south. So that puts them out of West Seattle range. But of course, what goes south, must head north again ... so we'll have radar up for later ..."

Our Alaskan cruise boat just pulled into Elliott Bay, there a tad south of Pike Street market and
at least 5 orcas
were frolicking right in front of the cruise boat. A real treat as we saw only humpbacks on the cruise itself. A police boat seemed to be keeping an eye out for their safety.

I just saw
several Orca whales
off of
Alki Point
headed west toward
Bainbridge Island
in Puget Sound (Google Maps says it was about here: 47.589, -122.417). I saw at least three, but there could have been more. It was about

8:45 to 9 AM
. I don't know what they were doing - looked like they were just traveling because they came up for air a few times (when I saw them) then disappeared. One of the three that I saw was a male with a very large fin.
Erin Ward

9:19am
- Just got a report of
orcas
southbound from
Alki

Rein Attemann

9:16am
- they went all the way to the
Duwamish head
and then appeared to be heading back out, off
Alki
30 minutes ago

In case you in West Seattle or downtown Seattle right now- wanted to let you know that there is a group of
8-12 orcas
(assuming transients)
in Elliot bay
right now. Last report had them near Alki at
around
8:50
. Strange spot for them.

Me and my fellow naturalist Corey were very excited to see the
J16's
this
morning
. The
afternoon
was also fab as we had superpod up by
Henry Island
and there were just whales everywhere!! Lots of activity with amazing vocalisations!

- Beam Reach students, Robin and students at lighthouse report
SRKWs
north and south of
Lime Kiln
. Calls and clicks now started
1103
. Direction was north, but may be changing to southwest.
*
A
superpod
passed by
East Point on Saturna Island
. They did every behaviour in the orca playbook but perhaps the biggest gasp from onlookers came when this group surfaced together in a line as they passed in front of the lighthouse. It was very impressive.
