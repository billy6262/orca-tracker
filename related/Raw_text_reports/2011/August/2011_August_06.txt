Orca Sightings for August 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon at

1:15 PM
a very spread out
superpod
started making their way south past
Lime Kiln
. J2 was in the lead, followed by the J14s, the K13s, and K12s. Many whales were several miles offshore, way too far away to be identified. There was a gap from

2:00-
2:30, when another group of whales came by. I'm not 100% sure because they were so backlit but given the number of juveniles and the dorsal fin shapes, I'm guessing it was the L55s, and it looked like L47 and L115 were also there. When I left around
3:00 there was still a large group of whales hanging out in the middle of Haro Strait, slowly making their way south.
