Transient Orcas (T060s)
came right into shore at Saxe Point in
Victoria BC between
1:50 and 2 PM
. One came into the bay while the others stayed a little further out. One graced us with a spyhop! And was probably the one that did an upside down tail lob and righted itself! I believe there were 4, but when I was looking through the ID catalogue there are 3?
