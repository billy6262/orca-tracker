We ended up at the south end of
Saturna
to catch up with
L pod
, headed north. They were cruising up the east side of the island. When we got there they were moving at a slowish speed, which was great because we were able to catch up to them before they headed out into the Strait of Georgia. We were there for maybe 5 minutes when suddenly, things started to escalate. They sped up and started porpoising, occasionally surfacing simultaneously in beautiful "chorus lines" 6 or 7 whales across. We motored offshore of the whales, trying to keep pace. Apparently the whales had other ideas. They always do. A few of them turned in our direction. The captain quickly maneuvered the boat away, farther offshore, but we were met by more sneaky whales coming in toward our stern. Again we turned and tried to move farther offshore. No dice. A third group of whales surfaced outside of us. We were surrounded. We shut down to let the whales pass. These whales did not appear to be interested in us, just the area we were in. I was expecting them to pass as usual, but instead they slowed and started milling around us. No one was particularly close, just milling on all sides of the boat. Perhaps there were salmon hiding under us? We sat, watching and listening to their forceful exhalations. We saw L25 (Ocean Sun) cruise by. We also saw a couple of the little L pod calves scooting around. We dropped the hydrophone and heard some faint calls.

Humpback Whale Entangled in Georgia Strait
. A couple of days ago, a Humpback Whale was spotted close to
Gabriola Island
dragging crabbing gear behind it heading up the Strait. As of a few hours ago, no-one has spotted the whale. There has been a Humpback seen in the upper Georgia Strait, but no mention or queries about any lines or gear on it.

Northern Resident Orca
Reports of possible Orca in or around Beaver Cove, outside Telegraph Cove and some by the Robson Bight Ecological Reserve, Orca by Cracroft Point and headed along Hanson Island and/or up Blackfish Sound, and a couple of groups of Resident Orca between Malcolm Island and the Penfold Islets, Queen Charlotte Strait. 8 or 9 Resident Orca spotted foraging and Westbound by Camp Point, just above Campbell River then in mid-Johnstone Strait.
