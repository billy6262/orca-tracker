Orca were out by Donagal Head, Malcolm Island foraging then heading West, more Orca were already by Lizard Point doing the same, foraging and heading West, other Orca were Eastbound down Blackfish Sound, while yet another group were already by Cracroft Point. By 10 am the majority had made it into the Bight, as far as the Eastern boundary, yet quite spread out as well as on the rubbing beaches.
