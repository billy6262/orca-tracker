Orca Sightings for August 5, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Arrived at
Lime Kiln at
9:30 to see a large portion of the J, K, L
pods pass heading north. The last group was large in numbers and much closer to the shore. One headed right in along the kelp line. ID's from our photos include: non-wound side of K21 (Cappucino); K40 (Raggedy); K16 (Opus; K22 (Seiku); J34 (Doublestuff); J22 (Oreo).

Spent the
afternoon
with
L's
at
Pender
. We i.d'd Gaia, Wavewalker, Tanya, Ino, Nyssa and Indigo...we think. The boys for definite! Haven't double checked the ladies yet. There was a really little calf in there aswell. They were resting at first and then all woke up and started feeding and socializing.

Transients off Tofino, T41, T41a and very young calf
found at
2pm
around Cleland Island, SE of Flores Island off Tofino. Jamies whale watching zodiacs were watching these animals as well as grays and humpbacks well into the evening.

We went international to observe a pod rumored to be around the
Gulf Islands
of Canada. Shortly after crossing the border and entering Swanson Channel we saw a group of around
fifteen lively orcas
. The surface around them was turning with activity as Mickey Mouse ear pectoral fins slapped the surface, full-body breaches created wakes and tails slammed onto the water. There were three mature males within the mix and the two that were traveling closely together appeared to be the
brothers Wave Walker (L-88) and Gaia (L-78) of the L2 matriline
.
