Residents were at
Hein bank
this morning around
10am
moving back towards San Juan Island. I believe we saw members of K pod. This afternoon we had reports that they had made it north of Lime Kiln, but by the time we reached them around

2:15pm
they were back out off of
False Bay
. We also saw some Dall's in Haro near the residents, and there are more Steller's everyday at Whale Rocks.

I drove (by car) to the San Juan Island Westside Land Preserve at about
5:45pm, no Orcas, so I headed south to see if they were still milling about. Pulling over at
False Bay
, I spotted a trailing
group of whales
heading northwest! So I went back to the
Hannah Heights
area at

6:30pm
, delighted to see the
Killer Whales
all spread in small groups, out in Haro Strait traveling northwest. After awhile I noticed a female with 2 youngsters stopped, just logging-resting at the surface. Then the whales up north turned and swam back, rejoining the other groups. I wonder if that female was a matriarch deciding they were going back south, enjoying the slack water, utilizing the ebbing tide?! The sun had set, light fading,

7:30pm
now, yet I stayed until I couldn't hear their strong breaths anymore.
