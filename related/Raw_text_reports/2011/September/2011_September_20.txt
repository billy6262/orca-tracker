Orca Sightings for September 20, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another wondrous, memorable trip out into the Salish Sea! Calm, clear waters, like a pond with a minimal ebbing tide. More sun and many, 50+? whales heading northwest from about

3:15pm to
4:30pm
, past Spieden and Stuart Islands.
J-Pod and L-Pod Orcas
spread out, some males further out in
Haro Strait
, while females with youngsters closer to shore. L-55 with the newest calf L-118 and the rest of her family were the trailing group, so they sped swam- 'porpoised' to catch up! All the groups gathered together as they had to decide which way to go at Turn Point. I guessed they were going to turn right, into Boundary Pass, and sure enough they did! L-Podders don't go the other way through Active Pass, as much as J-Podders do. They spread out again, heading toward Saturna Island, surfing the wake of a large cargo ship, and a parting breach. Breathtaking to see the whales and waters, island and mountain backgrounds.

I went out to Lime Kiln Lighthouse after hearing the amazing calls...most of everyone went north.
A small group (likely L12's)
stayed south. A mom and a couple young animals came from the north out of nowhere and surfaced at the light 3 times before continuing to head south. Beautiful afternoon out there!
