Orca Sightings for September 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had heard about
a minke beyond Cattle Pass
and so we went to investigate. After five minutes of searching--with the distraction of sea lions nearby for any short attention spans--the Captain of the Sea Lion spotted the tell-tale curved Minke whale dorsal fin. And another two minutes after that, passengers noticed it too! It appeared a little on the small side--a juvenile perhaps?--and continued swimming in what looked like foraging maneuvers.
