Orca Sightings for September 15, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Off of
South Beach
we came across members of
L pod
cruising off shore for a bit. We identified 'Mega' with some of his family, as well as 'Spirit' and 'Racer'. There were even some Dalls porpoise mixed in with the Orca. They seemed to be traveling together for a little bit. By

4:30pm
we were headed back up San Juan Channel and found some
Harbor Porpoise
as well.
