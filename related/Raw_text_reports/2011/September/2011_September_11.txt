============================================================

Entry 1:
We ran into the
T30's just north of Gooch Island
and also ran into the
T100's in the Strait of Georgia
, just a great day. Here's a picture of
T30 and T30A
and another of T30.

We were on the
Port Townsend Keystone crossing on the ferry
. We left PT on the
3:45...the boat was slowing and then stopped about

4:20 we all got to see at least 2 if not 3 beautiful Orca whales
...they were dipping and diving pretty close to the shore where the fisher men and women were fishing for salmon...I have never seen them in that close to shore before I am sure they were enjoying a good salmon run. I took a few pictures.

I'm very curious to know who the baby I saw is. Such a little cutey. It was a wonderful day to be out on the water - watching the whales from a safe distance. It was nice to see soundwatch there keeping an eye on the boats who weren't as respectful of the whales space. I've done whale watches in the past that really felt more like chasing the whales. I really enjoyed that we just stopped, shut down and watched and listened to the whales.

They just passed my house on Glen Acres (a bit north of
Dilworth, Vashon Island
) about 40 minutes ago, about

1:30
. They were heading north and FAST! probably even passed ferry by now. There was a small boat escorting them.

[
Orcas
] came by our place on
Dilworth
heading south in
late morning
, then turned around and were headed north a couple of hours later -- both times they were very close to the beach -- maybe 150' off-shore, so we had a great view of them without needing binoculars.

When kayaking from Vashon, we saw
three orca
swimming south about 1 mile south of
Faultleroy
and 1/2mile offshore. I saw from about 1/2 mile away with binoculars. One large fin surfacing and then one small right behind it. Not sure of the size of the third. Each surface and the big one spouted really well. Very exciting to the two others paddlers in our group.
