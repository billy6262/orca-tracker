This evening between

6:00 and
6:30 PM
members of
all three pods
headed south past
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. Many of the whales were close to shore, thrilling me and all the other visitors gathered along the shoreline on this holiday weekend. More photos of the encounter will be on my blog. It was good to see that L90 was present, traveling a little ways behind L26 and L92. She seemed to be surfacing normally and though by herself, was not the last whale to pass by.

John Boyd at Western Prince called at

1:10 pm
to report
Js, Ks and some Ls are north of East Pt
, aiming west.
*
12.45AM
- I heard some large splashes flukes and fins last night at approximately
12.45AM from the south end of Marrowstone
- approximately mid channel west across from Whidbey. Thought it was probably whales - and then just saw this email :)

Shannon McGraw called today to report that he was fishing
35 miles out from Depoe Bay OR
and saw
three orcas
. A male at least as big as their 22' boat approached and passed by them in the fog. They also saw an apparently injured dolphin struggling to swim about the same time.
*
About 4PM or so, out of Victoria
MV Coho crossing to Port Angeles was slowed and stopped midway in the Strait of Juan de Fuca by
a lone humpback slapping its tail
for many minutes, breaching and flopping down onto its side. Long elegant flippers waving, tale slowly splashing. An incredible treat.
