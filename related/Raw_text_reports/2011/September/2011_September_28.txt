Orca Sightings for September 28, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Large group of Orcas passed by
Thieves Bay, Pender Island
between
5.45pm and 6.45pm
, heading north. Well spread out in groups of 2 to 5 included males and at least a couple of babies. Estimate
15 - 20 in total
. Some transited straight through, heading north towards Active Pass. Others stopped to fish in the kelp beds 100m off shore or less. Entertained with a couple of spy hops (including one of the babies) and numerous pectoral and tail slaps. A number came back later on in the dark - we could hear them but not see them. Not able to tell if they were returning from the north or stragglers catching up.

I headed to the
Lime Kiln lighthouse
just in time to watch the
orcas
as they headed north on a beautiful fall day. The orcas were less than 20 yards away from the shore, in the kelp beds below the lighthouse.

Around
2pm
we found members of our resident pods
K and L, almost 50 whales
, spread out in Haro Strait heading up to Turn Point. We were able to identify
K20, L87, L41, L88, and K40
. We got to see a wide range of behaviors.

Here are some pics of the
T002C Gang with the new calf!
These were taken during our encounter starting at
1030hrs
and ending at approx
1300hrs
. They were travelling up Discovery Passage Northbound then went right thru Kanish Bay at the top of
Quadra Island
(north end of Georgia Strait). There may have been a seal kill near the end as there was some feeding activity and birds around after. The calf is the smallest I have seen for sure, looking more like a dolphin! They are my favorite gang of T's, love that T002c had the new calf.

Note: Many researchers are now using the term "Bigg's killer whales" instead of "transients" in honor of the late Mike Bigg, who pioneered field studies of orcas beginning in 1972.
