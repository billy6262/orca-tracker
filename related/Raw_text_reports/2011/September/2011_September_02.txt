Four to five orcas
, one a juvenile, were seen cruising around the rocky outcrops near
Iceberg Point off Lopez
. They were of the transient community with solid saddle patches and wide dorsal fins that angled further toward their posterior than the residents. We left them as they slowly started making their way north. On our way back, we noticed that Whale Rocks were crowded with gigantic Steller sea lions and encircled by a few harbor seals. This happened to be not far, and in the same direction the transients were moving towards. We wondered if a pinnipede smorgasbord was in the making.

Nancy Black of
Monterey Bay
Whalewatch (MBWW) reports that she saw
9 transient killer whales this afternoon
. MBWW got on them at about

3:30 pm
, along the south edge of Monterey Canyon. These were the
CA51s and the CA50s
, including two young calves that played together. They were breaching, spyhopping, lobtailing, rolling around and partying. Yesterday marks the 20th anniversary of the first identification of CA51 in Monterey Bay!
