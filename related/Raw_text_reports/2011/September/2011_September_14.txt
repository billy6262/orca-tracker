Orca Sightings for September 14, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today San Juan Safaris had
Transients in the middle of Haro Strait
heading out. We also encountered Dall's in the middle of the strait, Minkes near Salmon Bank, Stellers at Whale Rocks, and Harbor Porpoise in San Juan Channel. Mike, San Juan Safaris

Monday the residents headed back out to the Pacific, and sure enough transient families are noticed! We went to Canada,
south of Discovery Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
, from about

3:55pm to
4:25pm
, although a 4' flooding tide, the water was smooth, the sun came out for a bit! Reports were of 33 year old
T100 and her 3 youngsters, 38 year old T101 with her 2 youngsters, and a 27 year old male T102
. We also saw a third group I think may have been
44 year old T30
with her 3 offspring, as that male looked like her son, 25 year old T30A. Nice to see the youngsters from 5 to 14 years old, and the mature transients, all 12 killer whales, traveling close together. Unusually, one whale kept coming up sideways, showing its belly! No porpoise or seals out there- maybe they got the word! Back towards Salmon Bank and San Juan Channel appeared Dall's Porpoise, Harbor Porpoise and Seals, and Steller Sea Lions.
