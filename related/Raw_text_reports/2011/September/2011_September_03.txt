Southern residents (members of all three pods) off Saturna at 1.00 pm
. Porpoising, spy-hopping, breaching, full of life on a truly glorious day. Thanks, Soundwatch and Straitwatch, for being out there to help draw attention to the regulations and protect the whales

We ended up in the
Strait of Georgia
, just south of the city of Vancouver, with orcas spanning over a quarter of a mile lined up in smaller groups and heading north. As we paralleled them for a while, we were able to identify
J-27, "Blackberry
," as one of the more recently-matured whales of the community. He had a juvenile--possibly his little brother "Mako"--and two females and/or larger juveniles. The orcas engaged in just about every surface behavior they have in their repertoire, from tail slapping to spy hopping to even breaching, it was all there! Welcome back, resident orcas!
