The trained volunteers for the ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project spotted
12 killer whales
about 2 miles off off
Point Vicente CA
at about

1:30 pm
today. We got on them around 2 pm and confirmed them as transients: the
CA51s, the CA50s, and the CA140s
. They killed at least one sea lion, and were VERY surface-active: breaches, spyhops, headstands, close approaches - and mating!'' They were last sighted at about sunset heading very slowly eastward, still surface-active. The CA51s were the active group seen yesterday off Ventura, based on the images that Luke Dutton posted on the Island Packers Facebook; Luke and Captain Anthony Lombardi enjoyed watching them from the Islander.
