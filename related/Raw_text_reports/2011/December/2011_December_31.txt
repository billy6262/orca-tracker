They have moved more west, still just
off port Madison, slow movement SW.
Acting more like residents but low number is throwing me off.
*

2:16 -
they are mid channell
between Richmond Beach and out from port Madison
. Little spread out still southerly but have slowed out there. Looks like a research boat with them. Maybe 8 Orca with all sizes, one mature male, and a very young one.

John Rogstad of WA State Ferries relayed a call from the ferry captain of
4 orcas, one male, two smaller and one very small orca
, actively milling and splashing off
Apple Cove Point, near Kingston
, for the past 90 minutes.

11:40 -
Wow, they have been doing cartwheels, breaching, lunging, along with all that milling for the last hour in that same spot. So excellent!

Another report from Anthony Wolke on the ferry:
5 orcas are milling and foraging off Apple Cove Pt., near Kingston
, possibly going slowly southward.

Another orca update - are they moving south or north now? I noticed a pod of
orcas between Kingston and Edmonds today at
10:30 moving south
. Some spy hops, a few large breeches, lots of spouting. They got as far south as the oil docks and then headed north again. People coming off the ferry said there was one large male, a few females and 3-4 juveniles.
