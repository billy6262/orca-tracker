6:16 PM:
In the same spots that we have been seeing all of the humpback feeding activity just offshore of
Ventura Harbor CA
, four miles. We saw our first couple of spouts but alas they were from
a large group of Orcas
today! It was one of the best shows of these animals I have seen, there were at least 4 calfs and a maybe three females and a large male. They weren't moving in any particular direction, and then we found out why when Pink Floyd came on the stage and put a show on, multiple times. We ended up drifting with them and had a great show under the bow and playing with the passengers for over half an hour. There were some great pics and video taken, some will be posted on the Island Packers facebook site soon. The most amazing thing captured by our crew Luke on video was the calves vocalizing to us. The female brought the calf over to the boat and it lifted its head out of the water and started vocalizing and it was really neat to hear. There was a total of at least nine. We tried to find them on the way back this afternoon but to no avail. Early start to the season.
