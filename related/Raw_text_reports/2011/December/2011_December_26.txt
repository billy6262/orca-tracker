Orca Sightings for December 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Volunteers from the
Point Vicente
Interpretive Center spotted
killer whales near a fin whale
on Tuesday. We tried to get out with the killer whales off Pt. Vicente today, but they disappeared into the sun glare 30 minutes before we arrived on the scene; they had been with a fin whale - slowly headed west.
