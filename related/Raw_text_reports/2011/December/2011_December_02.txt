Orca Sightings for December 2, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
One of our volunteers works on Princess
Monterey Whale Watch
and said they saw
5 to 6 Orcas
. One with dorsal fin missing so most likely it was "Stumpy" plus there was another male with the group. According to another whale watch boat they had killed a sea lion before the Princess got to the area. If indeed it was "Stumpy" then it would have been the same group as seen last weekend in the same area, only yesterday another male was with them. Probably the one that is occasionally seen with them.
