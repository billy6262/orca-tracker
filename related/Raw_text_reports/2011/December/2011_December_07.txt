Orca Sightings for December 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Five orcas
were reported just
north of Nanaimo BC
this morning. According to Lon Kamann, they were headed north in Northwest Bay at

9:45 am
, near about 50 sea lions, which were "going crazy." There was one male in the group, and possibly one baby. Sounds like transients.
