Orca Sightings for December 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Note:
NOAA's NW Fisheries Science Center and the Center for Whale Research have confirmed that on
December 17,
39-year old J16 (Slick) gave birth to a new baby calf in Puget Sound
, probably only a few hours judging from the fresh fetal folds, before being seen and photographed by veteran field researcher Candice Emmons of NWSFC. This makes J16's fifth calf since her first, J26, was born in 1991. She was the sixteenth J pod orca photographed and identified by Mike Bigg in 1972, and is among the oldest whose age is known exactly. Her matriline is known as the J7's after J16's late mother.

We saw
two orca's right off Titlow Beach (off Tacoma)
heading towards the Narrows Saturday Dec 17 @ about

9:00am
. We thought possibly mamma and baby or teen due to the difference in their size. This sighting was a long time in coming and most overwhelming. As a result I was a little delayed in grabbing my cell phone and missed the window for pics!

Still very
audible at
11:55
(on
Port Townsend hydrophones
) until the boat drowned them out. Such a privilege to hear those beauties after spending the day watching them.

Lots of
calls still on PT hydros
.....definite
K Pod calls and a few Js
in there too.....not hearing any Ls though.....
John Boyd

2300
- Just began hearing a lot of
calls & whistles on the PT hydrophones
, with a lot of other noise as well - not sure who, but likely the Js & Ks that were in Puget Sound today.
Susan Berta

2241 - faint SRKW calls (on PT phones)
.
Jeanne Hyde

18:22

transient calls now - Lime Kiln Hydrophones

17:35 - Lime Kiln Hydrophones
- began hearing high pitched sounds every two to three minutes... still continuing.

The unofficial word from Brad Hanson of NOAA is that
Js, Ks and L87 were still together in Puget Sound
today. The last he saw of them was around

4:10 pm
as they were still "trending" NW
toward Admiralty inlet from Possession Point
, Whidbey Island, but he said he wouldn't be surprised if they turned around again.
*

3:45 pm -
Can see the
orcas
now from
Dave Mackie County Park on Whidbey
. They're to the southwest and look closer to the Kitsap side. Far off, but close enough to see sprays with the naked eye
Jon Scanlon

3:00 pm - Orcas
spotted off
Mayne Island lighthouse
; coming
from Georgia Strait into Active Pass
. I'm assuming J pod; I missed them by 15 minutes. ):
Deborah Simpson
*

2:42 pm -
Brad Hanson and Lori Wilson say the
orcas have turned westward
toward Admiralty Inlet.
*

2:24 -
Southside of
Whidbey off Posession Pt
, generally heading north into Posession sound.
Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

2:19 -
Lori Wilson says they are still heading
toward Possession Point
, but she still can't tell if they'll go up Saratoga Passage or Admiralty Inlet.
*

1:55 pm -
Brad Hanson called to say the
orcas
seem to be angling
NE toward Saratoga Passage
, but it's still too early to tell for sure.
*

1:43 -
they are nearing
Scatchet head, Cutlus Bay, Whidbey Island
.
Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

1:38 -
Lori Wilson called to say she sees
orcas heading north from north of Edmonds
, but it's too ealy to tell if they'll go up Saratoga Passage or Admiralty Inlet.
*

1:28 -
they are moving towards Whidbey
in the direction of Useless Bay
but still out in middle of the sound. Hard to say if they'll go around Posession or up the inlet. One of the most interesting actions of the day (besides breaches and tail lobs) was about noon when the lead 6-7 ( young ones included) orca turned rather quickly (from northern end of Edmonds) and porpoised really fast back southward to the group that was near NOAA research boat. The pod then stayed in a very tight group for at least 1 hour as they (and the research boat) moved slowly north. We were thinking an elder gave them a shout out to join the group for whatever reason.

1:25 -
