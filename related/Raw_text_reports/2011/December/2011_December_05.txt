Js and Ks and probably Onyx L-87
woke me up at

2:32 am
. But I realized they had been on both the
Lime Kiln and Orca Sound hydrophones
since about 1 am. Their calls lasted up until almost 6 am. More of the details and a couple clips I'll post on my blog Whale of A Purpose

Looks like the first calls were autodetected at
Orcasound around 1 a.m.
Still hearing them now at Lime Kiln, but any calls at Orcasound are masked by ship noise.
