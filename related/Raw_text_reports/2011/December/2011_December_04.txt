We had another amazing encounter with
the same transient pod that has been in the Bay for eight days now
, which includes the large male "Chop Top". Today the pod was joined by another large male. Today they attacked and
beat up a harbor seal
for at least fifteen minutes prior to killing and eating it. They injured it immediately and it was bleeding profusely, yet it hung on at the surface while they repeatedly tail whacked it and dragged it around and pushed it about. It was a very active and prolonged kill event, with the orcas surging in tight circles around the seal. There was plenty of partial breaches and tail lobs. It appeared that the
adults were letting the younger animals practice their techniques
. The coordinates were approximately 36.46.5N and 121.54.0W
