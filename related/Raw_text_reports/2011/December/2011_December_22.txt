Orca Sightings for December 22, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am reporting a sighting of a pod of orcas in
Big Sur CA
this morning. The approximate location is N 36.19975, W 121.730325 just south of sea lion cove. There were
3 adult females and one calf
and they were attacking or 'bullying' 2 adult gray whales. The attack happened about 300 meters from shore and about 500 meters from where I was standing along Highway 1. They left and swam south after about 10 minutes of interaction with the grays. I believe once they were about a mile off shore they got a sea lion, there were about 100 gulls flying around and the orcas were splashing a lot. This was at Torre Canyon, approximately: N 36.188113, W 121.732424 where there is a deep submarine canyon. I didn't notice any distinguishing marks on any of the females. I first saw them at

8:50 am
and then saw the possible sea lion kill at about
9:20 am. They were still traveling about a mile off shore and following the coastline south. The last time I saw them was at

10:20 am
at about Mc Way Falls (N 36.156865, W 121.697288). I have photos that I can send if you would like, but I have not put them on my computer yet.
