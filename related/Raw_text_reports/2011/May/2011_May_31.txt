Orca Sightings for May 31, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sean Minor called Orca Network with two reports. On
May 31 he saw
3 orcas
about 2 miles south of the jetty at
Newport OR
, including one male.
*
The
Transients
showed up again at the north end of
Haro Strait
. They were traveling south when we were with them at 2pm. We had
T87
with his distinct notch out of the trailing edge of his dorsal fin and a sweet little baby
T090C
.

Following up on a sighting of 1 whale in Active Pass, we located
5 transient orcas
southbound in
Swanson Channel
at approximately
1230
. The group was ID'ed as
T87, T124A1, and the 3 T90's
. The group was traveling slowly, against the inbound tide, and were possibly resting. We left them at 1330, still traveling generally south.

5:45 pm
- A radio call from the ferry, Powell River Queen, to Aaron of
Campbell River
Whale Watching gave a heads up of a
Humpback
Whale mid-channel between April Point and Painter's Lodge. The whale was headed Northward.

I had
2 harbour porpoise
by Elk Bay at 415 pm. Other than that just the
Lags
(short for Lagenhorynchus obliquidens the Latin name for Pacific White Sided Dolphins - SM). And 150 sea lions at Mitlenatch and a few were Californians. Cheers. Garry (Aaron counted around a dozen California Sea Lions - when you have that many, it's a bunch - SM)

2:45 pm: During one of my scans I spotted
5 or 6 Dalls Porpoises
looking like they were foraging just off Westview, Powell River heading towards the mill area. About an hour or two later saw what I believe were the same Dalls off the N. end of Texada slowly heading into Georgia Strait.

2:15 pm
: Call came in from Garry, Aboriginal Journeys about Approx.
20 or so Pacific White Sided Dolphins
at the N. end of Mitlenatch Island. They were slowly zig zagging in a foraging / feeding pattern.

11 am
: First overheard on the radio from unknown sources that there were very playful
Dalls Porpoises
just by Hole in the Wall. A little later, heard Fog Horn Jeff, Painter's Lodge saying that there was a large group of Dalls that were there and putting on a lovely show.

I was out of state until last evening, but received the below message regarding Orcas off of Salishan Spit at
Siletz Bay, Oregon
. Michael Mefford is a great observer so you can trust his observations. He lives on the spit. Roy W. Lowe, Project Leader, Oregon Coast National Wildlife Refuge Complex

18:30-
21:00: 15 Orcas
. I located the focus: orcas. A mix of a at least one adult male, females, immatures, and pez-dispenser size youngsters. They appeared to have seals so rounded. Observed frenzy and seal tail, but no red. They drifted northeast towards me until they were right off shore just beyond the first wave. Any closer and they would have beached. Close enough to see the white over the eye and the black swirl into the white at the anus. Observed three seals in same field of view safely inside the first wave. Observed breaching to side and to back, arching out of water, and leaping. There seemed to be sub groups according to age and may have been a second pod that left when I originally estimated 30. Lot's of behavior that I did not understand. They filled the exact same field of view for an hour before drifting back SW towards where that pilot first picked them up. Two hour long front seat sunset show.

Late report by text message from Jack,

We saw
two minkes at Salmon Bank
. They were quite spread out and didn't seem to be heading in any particular direction.

Off in the distance, we spotted five vessels off
Saltspring Island
, Canada. They appeared to be observing some
transient killer whales
. As our boat--the Sea Lion--got closer, we were able to identify a large male orca with a hooked or oddly notched dorsal fin. He was later identified as
T87
. Other vessels identified his companions as "
the T90s
," which would be T90 and a calf from 2005, T90B. We did notice a calf with the group of five and thought that because of its small size it may be a calf younger than T90B. The pod continued to zigzag around the boats and, at times, under the boats appearing on the other side of us after four to five minute down times.

We stumbled on
Transient orcas
today to the south of
Saltspring Island
and then followed them into the Saanich Inlet, just off of Piers Island. They were somewhat elusive and kept all the boats guessing.
