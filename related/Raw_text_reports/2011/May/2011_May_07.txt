Orca Sightings for May 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
No killer whales today, but we did see
Risso's dolphins
and
Pacific white-sided dolphins
mating a few miles west of
Moss Landing
. There was a pod of around 75 Risso's with just a few lags (Pacific white-sideds). The pairs swam right next to the boat many times and I believed I snapped a shot of the deed in photo 0248 (see photo below). I know there's been lots of accounts of Risso/bottlenose hybrids, anything on Risso's and lags? They sure were having fun!

At

6:15 pm
I received a call from John and Joan T. asking if I could see the Orca. There were around
8 or more Orca
- assumed to be Transients doing their longer dives heading Southward relatively quickly in front of Westview,
Powell River
. Some split off towards Texada, but continuing Southward. The other group were closer to the Mainland side and appeared to be on a kill when I lost them behind some trees just before 7 pm that are in my vantage point view.

At around

3:45 PM, a lone male transient
came through
Active Pass
. He milled about Georgeson Bay at the southwest entrance of the pass for about 10 minutes, before heading north up Trincomali channel. What is so interesting about this event, and others like it, is that this occurred at low tide, and there is almost always a large colony of seals sunning themselves on Colinson reef in Georgeson Bay, and yet the transients that come through never seem to be interested. In fact, the seals regularly ignore transients in this area, as if somehow everyone has agreed that this is a no-dinner zone. A neighbour of mine, who has lived on the Bay for most of his 60 plus years has only seen one incident in which transients fed upon seals. Any ideas as to why this might be?

We headed west this afternoon on the
12.15pm
Ocean Magic vessel and found
a Transient Orca
that appeared to be all alone near
Sooke
. It was slowly heading west with erratic turns that would head it east then west. Despite the cold wind, the rain and chop on the seas it was good to watch this rather illusive animal. Looked like a sprouter male initially, but some of those sharp, tall fins can be deceiving. It had a nice nick out of its fin, roughly a little more than a third down on its trailing edge. Hopefully someone knows who it was. Closest image in the catalogue to mine looks like T124C, a female, but why, if a she, was she alone.

Wonder if this orca is the same one reported in Active Pass, above?
