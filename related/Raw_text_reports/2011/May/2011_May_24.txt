Orca Sightings for May 24, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Following up a rumour of orcas near
Active Pass
, we located
T20 and T21
in the pass, near Miners Bay. The pair were traveling west through the pass, and then south in Swanson Channel. They were traveling slowly, with only about 3 breaths per surfacing, possibly resting. They passed by numerous harbour seals near Helen Point, and even one Steller sea lion without making any attempts at foraging. We left the T's southbound in Swanson Channel at the bottom of Mayne Island.

A scattered pod
, observed from the
7pm
ferry from Tsawwassen enroute to Swartz Bay, B.C. We were 10 mins southwest of the west entrance to Active Pass at about 8pm. It looks like they were headed into
Active Pass
. They were moving at a decent pace, with at least one adult female and a youngish (year) one. There were approx 7 visible at one point. I saw a couple tail lobs and one partial breach in the distance.
