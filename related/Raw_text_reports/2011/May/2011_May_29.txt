Orca Sightings for May 29, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Mercedes Powell, Kira Kranzler encountered
L's
heading south in northern Swanson Channel at

5:35 p.m
. (48 43.710 N; 123 17.380 W). There were several groups fairly spread out and porpoising. We tried to keep up with them until we reached Henry Island, but they never slowed down. There appears to be a
new calf
traveling with
L55
. This is a different calf from the one observed on Dec. 6th seen traveling with L5 (L117). We are tentatively calling the newest calf
L118
and will confirm the number of new calves once we have had a more conclusive L pod encounter. The groups we encountered were the
L4s, L26s, L43s, L47s, and L53
. The encounter ended just off Henry Island at
6:56 p.m. (48 35.60 N; 123 12.23 W) with the whales still spread out and traveling fast south.

Out into the shipping lane known as
Haro Strait
off the northwest side of San Juan Island, we discovered about eleven animals identified as part of the resident group
L-pod
! These animals were traveling south at a quick clip and as we watched them, we glanced several fins with one belonging to a small calf.

Watched the Greater
L37's
speed by the Center for Whale Research (
NW San Juan Island
) this
evening
. The water (rough) and lighting (backlit) reminded me of glory passbys of yesteryear but it was kind of weird to think that L92 is the big bull of that group. I saw L47, L82, and presumably their associated juveniles from the CWR. All but positive ID's on L53 and L83 but the water was pretty lumpy and the whales were backlit.

~
8:30 pm: L pod
, traveling very fast in at least 3 groups, very spread out mostly in the shipping lanes (off west
San Juan Island
). Water rough due to winds, swells 2'+ making it impossible to spot and count. They were "porpoising, " at times quite high to keep above the waves, giving us only quick glimpses.

7:30 pm: Calls on OrcaSound hydrophone! ~
8:30 pm: Loud and clear echolocation and calls on Lime Kil
n now.

Capt. Jim Maya called to report being with a large number of
Ls
today, ~20. At

7:30 pm
they were off
San Juan county park
heading south toward Lime Kiln Pt. He said they porpoised fast all the way from Mouat Pt. to Open Bay, like they were rushing to meet someone, and being pretty frisky.

7:05 pm
: L pod approaching
Mitchell Bay
on the west side of San Juan Island, quite some distance from shore. Rough seas out there - hard to spot them.
Jane Cogan, San Juan Island, WA

L27, L47, and L53
were the only ones I could ID for sure from
Lime Kiln
.

It was the first sighting of
L Pod
since November, and they were on fire. Fifteen miles of porpoising and breeching. From
N. Pender Island to Open Bay
.
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island, WA

From Dave Ellifrit by way of Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, that Dave was with the
L25 subgroup
from the south end of
Swanson Channel to Kellett Bluff
late today as the whales raced down from the north.
*
L Pod had been heard up at OrcaLab. As the day progressed, we heard very interesting reports of the whales going through Porlier Pass, and then down Trincomali Channel! Our wait was short as the whales decided to show an impressive burst of speed and were speed swimming for over an hour! They were making on average 7-9 knots, which is easily double what their normal traveling pace would be. But they weren't about to do the "normal" resident travel pattern. Captain's Passage became a cut through for the whales, and then just for fun they decided to cut between two small islands at the bottom of the Passage before entering Swanson Channel. And that's when the fireworks really began! Dozens of spyhops, breaches, single and double tail lobs, upside down swimming ...you name it, they probably did it! It was so exciting to see residents again, and they must have had full bellies to keep up such a blistering pace all while doing so much surface activity.

On Maya's Westside Charters at

1:30
we headed up to
Trincomali Channel
to meet the
L pod
whales who were heading our way. During this encounter I was able to get pictures of
L26, L90, L92, L53, L72, L105, L95, L47, L83, L90, L110, L115, L27, L55, L82, L103, L109, L86, L106, L112
and a couple additional babies. We returned for a late afternoon trip and found the whales to be porpoising their way down
Swanson Channel
, past Turn Pt. and on. They passed by
Lime Kiln lighthouse
at
7:40 pm spread across and continued on down/out direction.

We spent a short time with
Lpod
in
Porlier Pass
between Galiano and Valdes Islands. There were at least a dozen in the group. The only one I could positively identify was
L92
Crewser, but I'm pretty sure L82 Kasatka was among them as well. The light was behind them, so it was hard to see saddle patches even in passenger photos. They were traveling in a tight group when we first saw them, then spread out a little bit, and one of them spyhopped twice.

Following a report of
5 orca
on the east side of Valdez Island we were pleasantly surprised to locate approximately 15 members of
L po
d resting their way southeast. As they approached Porlier Pass, the group spread out and got very active, with numerous spyhops, some breaches, tail slaps and males swimming on their backs with their pectoral flippers in the air and flukes slapping on the water. The big surprise was observing this group swimming west-bound through Porlier pass against a flood tide. Many of the whales porpoised their way through the pass, which looked like running the rapids, and once in the calm waters of Trincomali Channel, they regrouped and appeared to resume resting. Positive ID's were made of
L26 Baba, L92 Crewser, L72 Racer, L105 Fluke, L95 Nigel, and L47 Marina
with a calf by her side!! We also observed a younger calf, but could not ID the female it was with. There were more L's present, but these where the only ones I was able to confirm ID's for. Perfect day on the water! Happy to see some residents back in town.

Saw
L pod
members this
afternoon
just off
Galiano island
. They headed through Trincomali Channel. L92/Crewser and his grandma L26/Baba were there with at least 6 others, including two calves (L112/Sooke?). They did a bout of spyhopping and and breaching before heading off at a quick pace (porpoising) south down Trincomali.

4:30 pm
overheard a report of Orca by Francisco Point, by
Campbell River
heading South. Both AJ and Jack found them shortly after the report. Jack identified
T20, T21
pluse 3 others including a young calf for a total count of 5 Transient Orca. He left them crossing Whidbey Shoals headed North around
5:45 pm.

At

13:45
there was a single average sized
Grey whale
in
Saanich Inlet BC
traveling north. A more precise location would be about half way between Goldstream Park and Bushart Gardens. I observed about 8 surfacings.
