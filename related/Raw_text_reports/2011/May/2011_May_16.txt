Orca Sightings for May 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sammye Kempbell of Whidbey Island called to report
5 or 6 orcas
off
Rosario Beach, Deception Pass State Park
at

12:43 pm
(J pod).
*
We were blessed with a visit of
8-9 resident orcas
at school (Anacortes Home Education Partnership at
Rosario Beach
). They came around Northwest Island from the north, really spread out, and headed south and west into the Strait. Possibly more members way out in Rosario.

Kelsey of Beam Reach called to say there were
orcas
south of
Cypress Island
about
11 am
.
*
We received this report:
J pod
reached the south end of
Rosario Strait
at about

13:00
today, making many clicks but no audible calls as they foraged from

13:55-
15:00
. The pod was spread out across the Strait from the SE corner of Lopez Island to near Whidbey Island Naval Base (2 miles offshore was mentioned on the VHF). When the Beam Reach research vessel last observed the small group closest to Lopez at
16:00, they were headed west near Iceberg Point.
*
Orcas
(perhaps as many as three) sighted

2:00 PM
between
NAS Whidbey and Smith Island
with 3 whale boats in vicinity. There was one larger covered boat (names unknown) and one "torpedo style" boat and a smaller perhaps pleasure vessel ranging back what seemed to be the appropriate distance. They appeared to be following the Orcas back to San Juan Island, probably out of Friday Harbor.

We headed out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, toward the south end of Lopez Island, many Harbor Seals and male Steller Sea Lions were hauled on Whale Rocks. There were reports of Orcas heading south down
Rosario Channel
, against a strong, 10+ foot, flooding tide.
J-Pod
families were very spread out and many turned back north. At about

1:45pm
, we saw whales swimming hundreds of feet from each other, on long dives, coming up to breathe. Was it energy saving to stay under the surface while they were swimming against that strong current? As fellow Naturalist Heather said; were they staying under longer to communicate about the hunt for salmon, over that long distance the pod was spread apart? We were happy to watch J-26, J-31, and J-39, until about
2:30pm (Didn't see a calf with them, so my guess on J-31 being a new mom is withdrawn)!

Monday found us out in
Rosario Strait
. The wind was picking up and there was a little bit of swell and chop, but it didn't deter us from spotting a very spread out group of
Transient Orcas (possibly J pod?)
. They were headed south at what seemed like a pretty good speed. There was one big male about 500 yards from us and two smaller whales another 600 or so yards from him. They had consistent, 4 minute down times and would surface even farther from us every time. The wind made it a challenge to keep up and we realized that the whales were hardly moving, just keeping up with the opposing current. We were the ones drifting and getting blown farther away. The big male continued to surface every 4 minutes or so. Even at 500 yards it was impressive every time. The very top of his towering dorsal would surface first and cut through the water like a shark for a few seconds. Then, slowly, he would rise until the rest of his enormous body was at the surface.

All
30+ Transient Orca
were up at
Robson Bight
around
9 am
. They continued in a Westerly direction then around 3 pm they turned East again heading towards Alert Bay, but still up at the top end of Johnstone Strait. These Orca were doing around 15 knots (close to 30 km per hour!) what Aaron had reported the other day. These reports were noted by Leah and Marie on Orca Live and from Donna of MacKay Whale Watching in Port McNeill. Orca Live had distant calls which could mean they're headed either out the top end of Vancouver Island or, based on their previous movements, probably in a big circle and maybe as far down the Strait as our area.

My neighbour across
Sansum Narrows
on Vancouver Island phoned me at
8PM
to say he'd been following
2 Humpback Whales
out of Maple Bay and into Burgoyne Bay. They were heading south in Sansum Narrows. Very exciting. This is the first report of the big whales here, although they probably were here before the whaling wiped them out of these waters.

We followed
2 Humpback Whales
from
Maple Bay on Vancouver Island to Burgoyne Bay on Saltspring Island
, and down Sansum Narrows past Burial Island. They were diving and spouting close together and it looked like there was a smaller one with a bigger one - Mum and baby? They were moving pretty fast and went all the way into Burgoyne Bay where the Government wharf is and all the "live-aboards" in boats. This is the first sighting of these baleen whales EVER in Sansum Narrows - anyway since I have been here. (Whales may be sneaking by all the time when my neighbours and I are not watching). Are these whales exploring old territory? Are they lost? I believe Sansum Narrows had lots of Humpback Whales long ago before we hunted them to extinction in these waters. I'd love to hear if anyone has any ideas about these magnificent whales. We followed them for about 2 hours - from noon to 2 PM.
