Orca Sightings for May 20, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We observed
15 killer whales
feeding on a gray whale killed earlier in the day off
Carmel Bay/Monterey Bay CA
, whales included the
CA51, 49s, CA28, N25
. This was in about 1,200' of water and it appeared the carcass may have been on the bottom as the whales
pulled pieces of blubber up from one particular spot the whole time
; part of the intestines were incised out and were floating. In the other attack we had over a week or so ago, the carcass was floating and the whales pulled it under to feed and then it would occasionally pop back up again but the guts were intact on this one. The day before (5/19) we also saw the
CA51s
travelling south along canyon edge.

J-Pod
has been in the Salish Sea for over a week! They headed north out of
Puget Sound
on Friday (5/20) with a strong flooding tide, into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, spread out on long dives, seeming intent on hunting salmon. About 5 miles north of Port Townsend, we watched them from about
2 to
2:45pm
.

I would like to report a pod of
orcas
that was moving south this evening at about
7pm
along the west side of
San Juan Island
. They were rather far out in Haro Strait but I managed to take some pictures from West Side Road, about a mile south of Lime Kiln Point State Park. Maybe you can figure out who these guys were. It seems like the whales had fun, we saw some breaches and a little bit of spyhopping (this looks like J pod).

I saw
J pod
at
Cattle Point
on the west side of
San Juan Island
heading north, at around 6, confirmed Ids of Blackberry, Doublestuf, Polaris and Princess Angeline.

Departed at low tide and headed south through
Cattle Pass
. There was word of Minke's (see Minke report below) and J-pod out towards Port Townsend. On the drive out we saw lots of Gulls feeding in bait, which is a good sign for whales.
J-pod
was well spread out and seemed to be feeding. Gulls and Auklets swarmed the bait that was being pushed to the surface by the feeding orca. After about 20 minutes or so of feeding the birds seemed to disappear and J-pod began to move in a more steady direction towards the west side of San Juan Island. On the trip home we used some passengers photos to positively ID Riptide out of the group. As we slowly approached the area where the Orca had last been spotted a
Minke whale
took a breath straight off our bow! It surprised everyone. While we were still catching our breaths from the Minke encounter the passengers began seeing smaller blows all around us.

The Victoria Clipper called Orca Network to report
6 - 7 orcas
outbound in
Admiralty Inlet
at

12:52 pm
, 1.5 miles west of the Sierra Alpha buoy N. of Pt. Townsend. Then we received another call from Stephanie Raymond, Clipper naturalist, saying J21 & "the cookies" were ID'd by the naturalist onboard.

At
11 am
I received a call from John and Joan T. that we had around
5 Orca
out in front of
Powell River, B.C
.

11:30 am:
Found the approximately
10 Transient
(meat eating) Orca between
Powell River and Harwood Island
. They were doing long dives, anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes, heading Northward in a somewhat zig zag pattern. Dropped the hydrophone, but there were no vocals. Suddenly it appeared that there were between 12 to 16 whales in a couple of groups between Harwood and just south of Atrevida Reef. 3 pm: The Orca had made their way to Lund and stayed split up into 3 or 4 groups. Some were by the Savary Island dock area, some by Keefer Rock just off Hernando Island, and the main group of 8 to 10 Transient Orca were by Lund aiming towards Major Rock and Baker Pass.

Got a call around

1:30pm
that there was a "group" of
killer whales
just West of Seal and Sail Rocks, which are East of
Neah Bay
. There were 5 individuals seen, one with a large dorsal fin, two smaller and two medium sized whales, and they were headed West.

Grey whale
sighting between
clinton and mukilteo at
11:09 am
. Closer to mukilteo moving towards hat island direction

Listening to the
Pt. Townsend hydrophones
we began hearing some very faint whistles at about

9:30 pm
or so. At first they were very distant and faint, and not very frequent. Then by 10 pm they became much louder and we were hearing more calls. They sounded more like dolphin than orca whistles or calls, but we have not yet been able to confirm what it was we were listening to. The calls continued until

10:30 or 11 pm
. Thankfully Jeanne Hyde was able to record some of the calls. We thought it may have been Pacific White Sided dolphins, which we have heard once before on the PT hydrophone (and they were later sighted off Everett to confirm that hearing!), but some researchers think the calls sound more like Bottlenose dolphins. We will let you know what we hear back from other researchers - but if anyone sees any dolphins in Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, or the San Juan Islands, or hears un-Orca-like whistles on the hydrophones, let us know!

1:33 pm Received a call from another regular contributor and neighbour, Steve G. of approximately
12 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
at Westview, Powell River, also heading Northward. A short time later, I received another call from Steve that actually the numbers were more in the neighborhood of
60 Dolphins
! This is the first time, in a long time that we've had these numbers around...wonderful, but what about the Transients who eat them?
320 pm
Found the Pacific White Sided Dolphins just arriving at Dinner Rock still heading Northward to Lund. There were closer to 80 of them, slightly spread out, but leaping and wake riding. Since they were heading Northward, I did too. They wake rode all the way back to the line between the Iron Mines and Savary Island when they suddenly broke off. Did they hear the Transients, who by this time were somewhere up closer to Baker Pass and Twin Islands? Jen and Garry both came back to see the Dolphins and I again headed back towards Powell River leaving the animals with them around 4 pm. What a great day...must remember more sunscreen.

The Ocean Magic out of Victoria was able to locate
two elusive Minke Whales
at
Hein Bank (Haro Strait)
around
1.30pm
. Certainly they were taking long dives and surfacing in different directions all the time. Quite the challenge, but it was nice to see possibly a mother and a youngster.

Jon Stern of the NE Pacific Minke Whale Project replied: Thanks for forwarding the minke sighting and photo...it does appear to be a mom/calf pair...it is impossible to be 100% sure as sometimes the size of the minke "changes" depending on surfacing characteristics at the time...but given the other whale as references...it sure looks smaller. and this is the time that calves are about to be weaned from their moms. Then a bit later, this announcement: We have changed Johnney Rotten's name to Chrissy Hynde-Bank...we see this whale a lot at Hein Bank off San Juan Island...I mean, since there seems to be a calf...
