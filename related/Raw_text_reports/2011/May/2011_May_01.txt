Orca Sightings for May 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was kayaking with my wife near
Saltery Bay
just off the east end of Hardy Island in Hotham Sound, B.C. (south of Powell River). A pod of
5 [orcas
] came north from Scotch Fir Point heading east toward Jervis Inlet. There appeared to be a large male swimming beside a large female and off to one side there were three younger orcas. I took some photos of the larger one which breached a few times (see photo below, and above photo of the day) . The orca that I am assuming is the big male was playing with what I am assuming was a larger female, swimming very close to her, rubbing against her and then breaching every so often. They continued this pattern as far as the eye could see.

Kayaking with some friends around Jetty Island we spotted
a grey whale
cruising the west side of
Jetty Island
through Possession Sound. To make the experience even more amazing, the whale paused to spy-hop a couple of times before proceeding on its journey. Additionally to the northwest between Whidbey and Camano islands we could see several spouts that we assumed were additional grey whales.

We left Friday Harbor with reports of a Minke Whale in Canadian waters. Under sunny skies and over glassy water we headed west. As we approached the area of the last sighting we slowed to a stop and shut down the engines. After fifteen minutes of scanning we saw the small whale surface about a quarter of a mile from the boat. We watched it surface and saw that it was moving east. We idled parallel at about 300 yards and saw a half dozen good surfacings. After fifteen minutes it changed direction again, we said goodbye to the
Minke
.

I was birding in
Florence, OR
along North Jetty Road about

11:40
when
three Killer Whales
swam by heading upriver. I watched them go past the crab docks and out of sight.

Adele Freepons called Orca Network to report seeing
3 tall black fins
off
Florence, OR
at
11 am
this morning, near the Coast Guard post, headed into the bay.
*
Fireman Martinez with the US Coast Guard called at

11:15 am
, reporting
3 orcas
- 2 adults, 1 juvenile, in the Siuslaw River,
Florence, OR
- he said they came up to the Coast Guard station, then headed back out.

I noticed
two Orca
. A male and female slowly traveling NW near
Haddington Island
, which is just West of
Alert Bay, B.C
.

Orca
off
Destruction Island, WA
, - Our sanctuary research team were working off the coast this weekend deploying oceanographic moorings aboard our R/V Tatoosh. They observed
at least 2 orcas
, one definitely a large male and the other presumably smaller with less erect dorsal. Attached are 2 photos, which are not very good res nor close. The location was about 0.5 km southeast of Destruction Island about

15:00
.

We have spotted a family of
Orcas
about 1 km away from Savary directly between Savary and
WestView (BC)
. There are
6 or more
. They were swimming in the same spot for 20 mins since we first saw them. They seemed to be moving slowly west. One had a large dorsal fin and looked large in the body. There were two medium sized orcas and 3 small ones that we could see. There were 6 that we could count but there could have been a couple more than that.

On outer coast survey late in the day (

15:09
) ran into a group of
killer whales
offshore of
Carroll Island
N 47 59.02 W 124 46.82. We saw probably
10-20 individuals
(best guest 13) but there were many more in the area. We followed several smaller groups, and saw at least 2 calves! All were headed North, the last group we left offshore Sand Point area.

Northern Resident Orcas, G pod
- After sending on the photos we received from the Makah Tribe of orcas off the
NW Washington Coast
to our list of researchers, we received the following responses which identified the pod as G pod, from the Northern Residents:
Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, WA: I'm reasonably sure the bull with the bunged up fin is G39 so it is safe to say they are northern residents. I'll defer to Graeme for any more ids.
Graeme Ellis, Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans Pacific Biological Field Station, Nanaimo, BC: These are Northern residents (Gs) and the male with the damaged fin is
G39
.

Transient orca T051
was with
T068C and T068C1
west of
Sheringham Pt. Lighthouse.
They were originally spotted by Gotcha Fishing Charters and were tracking east off Jordan River (south Vancouver Island). When I found them they were south bound on a line for the U.S./Canada border. I left them west bound mid strait south of Point no Point at
1615hrs
.

west bound at the top end of
Johnstone Strait
