============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit and Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J pod and L 87
spread out about a half a mile west of Otter Bay,
Pender Island B.C
. (48째 46.64 N; 123째 19.87 W) at

3:10 p.m.
The whales were traveling slowly and appeared to be foraging. They grouped up as the went through
Active Pass
. The encounter ended at the north end of Active Pass with the whales heading into the Strait of Georgia (48째 54.90 N;123째 18.439 W) at

4:52 p.m

Tuesday brought sunny skies and calm water. Reports of
J-Pod
off
Moresby Island
. The pod was spread out into smaller groups. Some were in way close to shore, while another group of younger animals were porpoising a little farther out. Other boats confirmed sightings of 'Doublestuf', and we were able to confirm sightings of 'Blackberry', who had a very consistent pattern of slow breaths and very slow descents, leaving his dorsal skimming along the surface. We also saw double spy hops, lots of rolling, some upside down swimming, pec slapping, and even some whales playing with the kelp.

A group of
orcas
had been spotted coming out of
Active Pass
heading East. So off we went with hopes of finding them somewhere out in the Strait of Georgia. We headed down to Eastpoint, and began scanning towards Alden Bank. And that's when we got word that
Transient
calls were being heard on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
. So off we went, and after a long trip, we were passing through John's Pass when we got yet another call--Transients in Active Pass. As we were passing Danger Shoal, we got yet another call--this time on the radio that one of the boats had found whales near
Moresby Island
.
J Pod
had mysteriously shown up, and we were glad to see them! We first encountered J26 Mike, and also saw J27 Blackberry and J30 Riptide (who seems to be growing larger all the time!) Then the fun began as we viewed what I call the "nursery group" of four juvenile whales. They were so content to hang out together, rolling around on each other, and occasionally displaying a "sea snake". Lots of upside-down swimming, pushing each other sideways. We saw L87 show us how the whales hunt fish with lots of lunging, direction changes, and a couple of high lunges!
