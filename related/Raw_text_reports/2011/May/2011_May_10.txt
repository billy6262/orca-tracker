Orca Sightings for May 10, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the return trip from Victoria, B.C. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J pod and L87
off
Eagle Point
at

3:15 p.m
. (48째 27.059 N; 123째 03.76 W). The whales were very spread out and apparently foraging. The encounter ended north of Hein Bank at

4:58 p.m.
(48째 24.363 N; 123째 59.489 W) with the whales still spread out and heading south east.

Ivan had spotted
Orcas
and we should head to
Beaumont Shoal, Haro Strait
. As we continued to search we started to see lots of fins in the distance, lots of fins; it must be J-Pod! As we slowly approach we came across
J-34 Double Stuff
and family. We were treated to 3 great breaches then as the whales approached false bay they slowed down and spent the next hour + in small groups hanging out on the surface, logging, rolling, spy hopping, tail slapping, pec slapping with many small chin ups (see photos here, and John Boyd's photo of the day, above). All in all there must have been 30-40 Spy Hops/chin ups. JB and Hobbes commented that the one time they had seen this type of behavior a new calf was sighted the next day!!! We will see. On top of all of this we had great vocals on the hydrophone, surface vocals and raspberries. Seemed like a September day in May. Nice to see the whales seemingly content and relaxed, not moving in search of food as they commonly are this time of year.

20 to 25 Orca
coming out of Frederick Arm (just above
Desolation Sound
, north end of the Strait of Georgia) at

7:30 am
, moving very rapidly Westward. Aaron with Campbell River Whale Watching was out on the water and said he was running at 15 knots to try to keep up with them. Full porpoising out of the water - spectacular sight. By
9:30 am the Orca were into Nodales Channel still in a Westerly direction. I received further updates from Jack during the day, heard bits from Lady Hawk (Jen) and others on the marine radio, as well as AJ later in the day. The Orca split up and spread out. Some zig zagging, some heading Southward toward Seymour Narrows and some staying above the Narrows. By
11 am
some had entered the Narrows and although the debate was "Who are these whales?" the most likely is that they were Transient Orca. By

5:15 pm
there were
8 to 10 Orca
by Maude - basically they stayed in a small area for a long period of time.

1536
:
J pod
traveling south at Eagle Point (
W San Juan Island
); from False Bay at
1446
. Whales are very spread out, making lots of calls over low boat noise. Thus far J1 has not been sighted.

Starting out north on a nice, calm, sunny afternoon, no whale reports. Then, then! a rumor of
Orcas
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, heading in east! So we turned around, headed south and west, and started seeing killer whale fins off of
False Bay
and San Juan Island, swimming against an ebbing tide. Closer at about

1:15pm
, we noticed a female staying in the same place at the surface for about a half hour, and the 5 family groups spread out. They started to move and gather closer together, actively spy hopping, turning on their backs, tail fluke and pectoral fin slapping the water surface, and a juvenile breached! They slowed down their swimming, made circles and direction changes. We put a hydrophone in the water and heard non stop vocalizations! As we watched all the active behavior, we noticed a very small calf and wonder if a birth had taken place recently? My guess for the mom is J-31 Tsuchi. We also ID'd J-2 Granny, the big boys- J-27 Blackberry, J-26 Mike, J-30 Riptide, and J-28 Polaris and their families. J-Pod seemed relaxed and hopefully found salmon! At
2:45pm they had turned northwest, still off of
False Bay
.

Andrew Beckett called at

9:10 pm
while he was watching
2 orcas
that had been just a few yards from shore off
Skiff Pt, Bainbridge Island
, WA and were then headed east toward Seattle. It was too dark to tell if either was a male.
