We spotted 10
orca
off of Cape George at
6 am
. They were moving rapidly to the east along the shoreline of the Quimper Peninsula (near
Pt. Townsend, WA
) and were traveling in a tight group. We were some distance away on Protection Island, but we could see 3 males in the pod and one smaller orca coming up close by an adult female each time it surfaced.

A rare pod of
transients
turned up in
Vancouver Harbour
. Lots of news coverage, including the cover of the Vancouver Province newspaper today, along with a photo gallery here.
