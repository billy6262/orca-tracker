Orca Sightings for May 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Mercedes Powell, and Kira Kranzler of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor at
3:30 p.m., with reports of transients heading north near Kelp Reef. We encountered the group of
five transients
traveling north at

3:44 pm
, about 1.5 miles north of
Kelp Reef
(48째 31.45 N; 123째 13.33 W). The whales consisted of
T26, T26A, T10, T10B and T10C
. We followed the whales for several hours while they slowly traveled north up Haro Strait. During most of their travel they were very spread out. At

6:55 p.m.
we ended our encounter and began our trip back to Snug Harbor, only to be called back to the scene a few minutes later because the transients were hunting a porpoise. We arrived back at the scene just as the hunt was concluded, with the whales appearing to have made a successful kill. We departed for a second time at

7:20 p.m.
, leaving the whales milling around their suspected kill, three quarters of a mile east of Morseby Island (48째 42.80 N; 123째 16.02 W).

The
T10's
were first spotted a couple of miles south of
Constance Bank
in the morning and moved through Oak Bay and then up
Haro Strait
. During our evening trip we caught up.

We headed north with reports of Orca up near Pender Island. By the time we were on the water about 30 minutes the next report came in that the whales were moving steadily north towards
active pass
. We were committed to finding Orca for our passengers so we continued on. As we reached active pass we slowed and tucked on the side as the big BC ferry came through. While we waited for it to pass we were able to spot an eagle perched at the top of the highest tree. We came around the corner and entered the pass and were lucky enough to spot the whales. There were five transients cruising north. After a few good looks we recognized a calf in the mix along with the big male
T87
.

T87
with 4 others (I think they were T88's but not sure) in
Swanson Channel
heading north. Mostly just traveling but we had one chasing something briefly.

With some very scenic backdrops the
T10's
were doing what
Transients
do best, celebrating after a kill. Although we didn't see the hapless prey animal dispatched below the surface , we certainly saw the clean up gulls fly in as well as the behaviour of the Transients changed. They started to celebrate with tail lobs as they slowly traversed the shoreline of
Chatham and Discovery Islands
. We had first encountered the four T's at Oak Bay Flats around 1pm.

We spent a great day on the water with Island Adventures, and saw a group of
Transients
up near
Chatham Island
. We were told they were
T26, T26A, T10, T10B and T10C
. They appeared to be feeding close to shore for a bit...going in circles and splashing, with lots of tail flaps and a spy hop....fantastic! Then they headed up North toward Haro Strait.
