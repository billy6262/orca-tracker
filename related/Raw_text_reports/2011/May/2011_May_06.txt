While on the Phillip's 26 Glacier cruise in the

We picked up
2 killer whales
at 54/57 at

11:30 am
milling about at around 3 knots. They surfaced together and separated several times, often staying down for over 8 minutes. There were several little pods of harbor porpoise in the area. At
12:30, the killer whales picked up speed and darted after some porpoise and definitely killed at least one-- there was blood in the water and we could see the harbor porpoise in both the male & female's mouths at different times. I believe the female is CA50, not sure about the male-- his eye patch is a perfect oval. The kill was made at 53/54. In picture 0135 you can see part of the harbor porpoise. So cool!

Between
10 and 11 this morning
, we spent some time with
a gray whale
SE from
Gedney Island
. It seemed to be feeding, but also spent some time logging on the surface, breathing frequently and a couple times rolling to show a little pectoral fin.
