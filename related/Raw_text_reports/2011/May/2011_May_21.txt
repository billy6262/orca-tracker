J-Pod
families came down
Haro Strait
into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, with the end of an ebbing tide, heading to Salmon Bank. We had a few glances of a
Minke Whale
, then we saw the Orcas at about
1pm
, who seemed relaxed in the calm, slack water. A few females logging-resting at the surface, then some of the Orcas started tail- fluke slapping the water, spy hopping, breaching, and rolling around on their backs and each other! J-Pod decided to swim through Cattle Pass into
San Juan Channel
! We don't often see whales going through this narrow pass into this smaller channel, very exciting! Many of the whales joined up and it was great to see a group of calves, females, or the males together. Able to identify J-2 Granny with L-87 Onyx! L-87's dorsal fin is wavy like J-1 Ruffles, his dad? And Granny's grandson?! Also ID'd J-8 Spieden and the 'boys' J-26, J-27, J-30.

Beam Reach was with
J pod
just off
Friday Harbor
, moving NW up San Juan Channel at

4:14pm
.
*
Marie at Washington State Ferries called at

3:36
to say a ferry captain reported he was surrounded by
orcas
about a mile east of
Turn Island, San Juan Channel
.
*
After cruising south, we spotted some dorsal fins off of
Cattle Point
, and then more dorsal fins and then even more. We had discovered a very spread out
J-pod
! The pod was split up into several different groups, some of which were diving for extended periods of time (several minutes), others were tail slapping and others were breaching full out of the water. We had sightings of Mike and Blackberry as well as the calf Looker and a possible sighting of Granny. We returned to watching J-pod as they continued traveling north towards and then past Friday Harbor. Returning to the harbor, we passed... J-pod again!
