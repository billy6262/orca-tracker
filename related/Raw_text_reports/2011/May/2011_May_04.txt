Orca Sightings for May 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J pod and L87 off Kellett Bluff
. The whales were spread out traveling south in Haro Strait. The encounter ended just north of the Center (NW San Juan Island) with the whales still moving steadily south.
*
After picking up a friend at sea/tac we caught the

8:30 p.m. ferry from Mukilteo
. As the ferry was pulling out of the Mukilteo terminal (heading to Clinton) - we spied - approx. 100 yds from the ferry - on the west (left) side ( in some 'turbulent' water ) and watched for several minutes - what appeared to be - either a gray whale (which was diving and feeding) - or - an orca (or more than one orca). We could not figure out if it was the tail of
a gray whale
- or the fin on top of an orca - that would appear above the surface - then disappear. Any thoughts or other reports that would confirm either?

J-Pod
on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
at

6:29 pm
WA time. Getting slowly louder! ~
7:30 pm: I can't hear them anymore, and there is too much boat noise on OrcaSound hydros to hear anything.

Just heard a couple of vocalizations

12:22
Pacific on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. I heard a call at approximately
12:30 PDT that I have never heard before after four years of monitoring - what was that?! (Super high frequency several seconds long squeal, as I would describe it). I am again hearing faint calls at Lime Kiln hydrophone at
14:35 Pacific time. Wow, those screeches earlier were exceptional.

In the middle of
Haro Strait
we saw
two orca
cruising at the surface. They were heading west at a pretty steady pace. After scanning the horizon we realized that some other boats in the area were watching their own groupings of
J-pod
. There were whales spread over a couple mile radius around us. While we couldn't get a good positive ID on the first two whales we saw, as we moved towards a second group we recognized the distinguishing saddle patch of Blackberry!

Pat Harper called to say a
gray whale
was in
Holmes Harbor in Freeland, Whidbey Island
, at
9 pm
, 100 feet from shore, rolling sideways (likely feeding), at the park at Freeland Park.
*
I just saw a
Grey Whale
near
Whidbey Island
within
Holmes Harbor
about 2 miles north of
Freeland
on the east shore (this location is a bit south of the above report - the whales must have gone down toward Freeland, then circled back north to be seen about two hours later by Pat Harper). Google maps approximate location is: 48.040701,-122.509987. There were probably
two whales: an adult and an infant
. There is a sand bar there with ghost shrimp, so the whales were probably feeding. They swam around in circles for about half an hour before heading south toward Freeland. Time:

7:15-
7:45 PM
local time. We have only seen whales a couple other times at that location in the 30 years we've lived there.

I was flying over near
Everett
at

6:30 PM
and saw
two gray whales
feeding north of the big marine marker that is north of Hat/Gedney Island and west of Everett. I circled them for about ten minutes. They were feeding heavily with huge plumes of mud billowing out from their mouths as they would come up to surface for a breath before feeding again. I did take some pictures and will get them to you in the next couple of days.
