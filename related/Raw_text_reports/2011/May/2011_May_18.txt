Orca Sightings for May 18, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Mercedes Powell, Kira Kranzler of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor on a clear and sunny afternoon at 3.59 pm with news of Transients. At
4.29pm
we found the eight [
orcas
] loosely spread about a mile east of
Beaumont Shoal (SE of Victoria BC)
buoy (48째 26.44 N; 123째 08.89 W).The individual whales were
T99, T99A, T99B, T99C, T65A, T65A2, T65A3 and T65A4
. The Females and calves mainly stayed in one group whilst two young males T99A and T65A2 played together constantly throughout the encounter. We stayed with the whales until
6.25pm
when we left them about one mile South East of Seabird Point (48째 24.86 N; 123째 12.92 W) in tight medium travel, heading South West.

At

10:10 this morning
I was witness to a pod of
orcas
heading south on the west side of
Whidbey
. There were at least 5 or 6 maybe more). I even saw a spy hop. Only after my excitement settled down, did I realize the boat off shore was a Whale Watching Excursion. The orcas were between it & our beach, about 100 to 200 yds. out, 1/2 mile south of Hastie Lake Rd. WOW!

As we cleared the pass and entered Haro straight Captain Craig pointed our bow south
towards Partridge Bank
. But half way there we took a sharp right and headed up the straight as we spotted some
Orca
closer to our position. We came on scene with just a couple other boats and found maybe 8 or so charismatic animals. None of the boats had been able to get positive IDs on any of them. But there was plenty of surface activity including some porpoising behavior and a few spectacular breaches. We stayed with the whales for about 25 minutes before turning back towards home.
