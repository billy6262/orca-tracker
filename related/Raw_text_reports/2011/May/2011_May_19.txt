Entry 1:

and seal feeding in a shallow area at high tide, east of the end of Arrowhead Beach Road,

At

6:20 pm
I was flying across
Everett Bay
and spotted a
gray whale
feeding north of Hat Island and West of Everett. I could just see the whale rolled over on it's side feeding through the murky water. There were three seals (that I saw) feeding on the scraps in the mud plume that the whale left behind.

Saw a
gray
in front of my house at
Polnell Point (near Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island)
this morning, foraging about 50 from shore.

At

13:10
we ran into this group of
killer whales
outside the
Neah Bay
jetty heading West in the strait. There were at least 7 different individuals traveling, saw a few taillobs and quick turns as well!

Once we got around the corner off of
South Beach, San Juan Island
we saw a small
Minke Whale
lift his head to the surface and then slowly roll back under. He surfaced 3 more times and then took a longer dive. We waited about 10 minutes before he surfaced again about a quarter mile away from us. We idled forward in the direction of his last surfacing and saw him come up once more about 250 yards from our boat. It was a great Minke sighting. The smooth, calm water made it easy to see the elusive cetacean.
