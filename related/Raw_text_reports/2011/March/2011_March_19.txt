7:30pm
- We went down to
Point No Point (Hansville, WA)
to watch the full moon rise. While waiting we watch a group of 4 sea lions feeding and playing in the turning tide. We also observed some harbor seals feeding in the same area and possibly a group of river otters. Suddenly there was a commotion and the seals went under just as a large flipper rolled up. A
grey whale
was feeding there too...it was the McDonlads of the Sound, everyone was eating very well tonight! This went on for about 30 minutes
until the moon rose
. We saw the grey whale rise about four times before he headed west along the shoreline. We saw his dorsal ridge, a bit of fluke and heard several good, loud breathes. So your prediction of whales swimming through the moonglow on the water came true.

7 pm
- We saw a
single Gray
feeding in
Penn Cove
near the pottery store and mussel pier at San de Fuca (Penn Cove, Whidbey Island, WA).. There is a single sailboat moored offshore that the whale was staying within 100 yards of.

Sammye Kempbell of Whidbey Island called to say she was watching at least
one gray whale
in
Penn Cove
, well in between San De Fuca and the Capt. Whidbey Inn at about

6:50 pm
. It's been there for at least an hour. No obvious feeding, unless it's below the surface during this high tide.

Coming back from a beautiful day in Seattle, we happened upon
a gray whale
feeding at the bottom of
Penn Cove
today around
6:30pm. Will send in photos if any are worthy. My neighbor said that he's been feeding below our cliff all day today right across from Coupeville!

We were out having a picnic at the point south of Grannies Beach on
San Juan Island
yesterday afternoon. After an hour or so of watching Surf Scoters, Pacific loons, Grebes and Harlequins we ventured into the next cove to explore. We both were surprised to hear the sound of a whale blow; we spun around quickly in time to see
a Gray Whale
surface very close to shore. This was around

5:30pm
. We climbed to a higher viewing point and watched it surface a few more times (a couple of fluke up dives) then headed down to Cattle Point. About

6:30pm
we saw it surface a couple more times NE of the Salmon Bank marker headed east.

6:00 P.M, one grey whale

Penn Cove
, Whidbey Island, WA).

We weren't out long off the
Victoria
water-front when word came that
a Gray Whale
could be seen, and luck was with us! Around
1pm
we caught site of its bushy blow against the skyline of Victoria.We watched this Baleen whale take two-three breaths at the surface and then lift its flukes for a deeper dive (see photo above). Attached pic is cropped to show some of the markings of this individual. It was the Ocean Magic's first trip out for the season and our luck continued.

About

9:00 AM
Saturday,
two small gray whales
were sighted on
Mutiny Bay
near the boat ramp. They were traveling generally north while playing and circling each other. They were fairly close to shore and in shallow water.

I just wanted to pass on that my wife and I watched
a grey whale
feeding on the east side of Elger Bay (west
Camano Island
, WA) at about
8 am
this morning for about half an hour.

Thanks to Ivan Reiff on the Western Prince we were able to view
J pod
on Saturday
afternoon
north east of
Turn Pt
. They were in a resting formation traveling north for East Pt. It looked as though the J16's along with J2 and J8 were not present.
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria, B.C.

We traveled north up
Haro Strait
, and encountered several members of
J Pod
, in a resting formation, heading toward Boundary Pass at
2.30pm
.
J27, J17, J28 and her little one, J46
, could be seen. It appeared that only half of J Pod were traveling in this group at this time.

First a trip to Speiden Island. As we scanned
Haro Strait
, there were almost a dozen dorsal fins about 3/4 of a mile in front of us!!! But imagine our surprise when the first whale that came clearly into view wasn't a transient like I suspected, but
J28
and her calf!!! RESIDENTS!!! Soon we were seeing lots of familiar dorsal fins--J28 Polaris and her calf J46 Star. J27 Blackberry. J22 Oreo, and her getting-bigger-everyday son J34 Double Stuff. It was so magical. The whales were heading for Turn Point when suddenly they all turned east and headed towards Eastpoint.

9 am
: Again south side of
Hat Island
, watched numerous blows as presumably single
gray whale
headed west toward Clinton. Closer to ferry lanes than yesterday. Watched blows from 2 distinct grays(?) SE of Hat Island around noon today for 20 minutes or more.
