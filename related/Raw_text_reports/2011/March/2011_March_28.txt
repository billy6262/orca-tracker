We saw the
transients
off of
Pender Island
- on one side were the females and calves, and on the other two males. There was one boat that was definitely not behaving properly.

Around
3.30pm
was one of those special days when word came in that a number of
Transients
were seen traveling north in
Haro Strait
. By the time we caught up with them in a zodiac having traveled from Victoria, they were heading toward
Active Pass
. There was considerable chop on the water but we could see the two little ones rise well above the waves. The two males, off on their own, appeared to hunt below the surface and what ever they caught, it was soon dispatched. Mark Malleson, our Skipper, identified the group as the
T100's and the T101's
with the two males, as
T102 and T101A
. Always awesome to see these wild and free Orca in their 'Natural' environment.

Just before
noon
, sighting reports started coming in of
Transient (mammal eating) Orcas
in
Haro Strait
headed toward our little harbor but soon got the call that they had been spotted north of Snug Harbor. We got to them up near
Stuart Island
.

I got a call that there were some
Transient (mammal eating orcas) in Haro Strait
! We first watched the three members of the
T103s
as they passed
Stuart Island
heading north. They seemed to be on a mission to head towards Pender Island, and we managed to get some very nice viewings. Then Ivan decided to go look at the other group of Transients. This group is known as the
T100s
, and there were
six whales
in this group of what appeared to be all females with two younger calves. The calves were quite the hit as they regularly and repeatedly came quite high during their surfacings!

Six orcas
were seen this morning from the Center for Whale Research, but no IDs yet.

11:05 am:
The Beam Reach students visiting the Lime Kiln lighthouse just spotted at least
4 killer whales
off of
San Juan County Park
, possibly heading north. No calls heard or detected on Lime Kiln or Orcasound hydrophones.
