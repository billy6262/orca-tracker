Orca Sightings for March 17, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went for a flight at about

5:30
and spotted
two gray whales
feeding near the big marina marker NE of
Hat Island
. The tide was high and the whales were not spending a lot of time on the surface. One of the whales was Patch (Number 49). What a joy to see him again! I took one good ID shot as Patch was heading back down for more food. The other whale was more difficult to ID.

, at

3:30 pm
, moving slowly south in shallow water and apparently feeding.
*
2 gray whales
paid a visit this morning, at

10:30AM
. Unlike last night, both feeding together, right out front; SW of entrance, to
Mariners Cove
. Short snack and then they journeyed onward in southwesterly direction. Towards, Polnell Pt. [east of
Oak Harbor
] on Whidbey Island; where I left them at sunset, early, last evening. Unlike last night they traveled together, and much of the time fed right next to each other or within a 100 feet apart. Usually, 100 to 200 feet off the shoreline. One did most of the swirling, burrowing into the sand, suctioning up the ghost shrimp; [that will create craters in the sand when sand is exposed at low tide]. While, the other, appeared to do very little circling/swirling activity. Lots, of flukes and flippers "out of the water" exposure; resembling beautiful slabs of granite.
