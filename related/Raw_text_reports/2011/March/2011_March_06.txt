Orca Sightings for March 6, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving a tip that whales were near Victoria heading into Haro Strait, Dave Ellifrit and Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research were able to spot them from the Center (
NW San Juan Island
). The whales, who turned out to be members of
J pod
, were grouped together as they exited Baynes Channel, but spread out quite a bit as they headed over toward San Juan Island. Center staff caught up with the leaders off Kellett Bluff (48 34.95; 123 12.32) at

13:20
as they continued their northward progress. Scattered members of J pod were seen throughout the encounter, as well as L87. The encounter ended off Open Bay (48 34.87; 123 11.84) at

15:00
.

We caught up to the trailing group just north of the
Pender Bluffs
at
1620
, and they were scattered into three groups of about 4-7 [
orcas
] in each group. No sign of J1, but he may be hanging out with L Pod for all we know (after all, if you looked at Ls right now, you'd think L87 was missing but we know he's with J Pod right now).

Mark Malleson had spotted
J Pod
near
Victoria
, and they were headed our way. By
1:00 we were headed out into
Haro Strait
. Right outside of Snug, where we dock the Peregrine, we spotted blows.
J2, Granny
, was in the lead. We just kinda sat there and waited for the rest of
J Pod
to swim by. They were all there with the exception, sadly, of J1, Ruffles. It's really hard to believe he might be gone, but with every sighting of J Pod, the chances of him still being alive grow slimmer. We left all of J Pod, except J1, spread between Kellet Bluff, Henry Island, and I would guess Turn Pt, Stewart Island, headed N at

3:00
this afternoon. Lots of foraging.

Kathy and I saw several
big blows
near the
Edmonds ferry
lane on the Apple Cove Point side at around
2 pm
today. Some breaching, mostly just big blows followed by a view of the back, no dorsal fin visible? Too far to tell what type of whales or how many, definitely more than one. The blows seemed big for Orca's and they were spead far apart and a long time between blows, although we did see a couple blows right after another and close together. Seemed to be moving south from Point No Point towards Seattle.

I spotted
J pod with L87
south of
Victoria
in the early hours of Sunday
morning
. It looked as though all of Jpod less J1 were present and L87 was traveling with them. They rounded Trial Island and headed north through Oak Bay in two resting groups. Upon entering Baynes Channel they spread out and several animals started foraging with several of them high speed porpoising. Unfortunately none offered any prey samples for the taking. I left them at

10:50
north of Ten Mile Point light pointed for Kelp Reef.
