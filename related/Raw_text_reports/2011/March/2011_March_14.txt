Orca Sightings for March 14, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales were reported seen by Washington State Ferry personnel near
Friday Harbor
at
0810
, and there were several reports throughout the day of whales in the channels surrounding
Shaw Island
. In the afternoon, Jim Maya reported seeing members of
J pod
in New Channel just north of
Speiden Island
. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research aborted his inflatable boat trip to Victoria to respond and encountered 20 members of
J pod and L87
spread out and heading southwesterly between Speiden Island and Stuart Island toward the confluence of Speiden Channel and Haro Strait at
1606
. The whales appeared to be in relaxed loose travel/forage mode as they headed out into the turbulence of Haro Strait, but no obvious feeding episodes were observed. The various sub-sub groups of whales were spread over several square miles and were swimming in various directions when the encounter ended at
1722
. The whales could be heard on the Orcasound hydrophone at 1730 and were seen heading north off Halibut Island, BC. Apparently, they headed back up toward the Gulf Islands in the night.

3pm
, while out with Jim Maya of Maya's Westside Charters we encountered
J pod
whales on the north east side of Spieden Island traveling close to shore. The J Pod whales seen were Samish's family group the J14s, Blossom's (now deceased) family group the J11s, Slick's family group the J16s, Shachi J-19 and her offspring Eclipse J-41, and Oreo's family group the J22s and Onyx L-87. Those not present were Ruffles J-1, Granny J-2, Spieden J-8 and Princess Angeline's family group the J-17s. We left the whales, quite spread out, as they were 'sort of' heading south in Haro Strait. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research was with the whales when we left. At about

5:30 pm
calls were heard on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
. However, the volume and duration of the calls indicates that perhaps the whales did not come down Haro Strait.

Jeanne Hyde and Capt. Jim, heading out at
1:30, knowing only that this morning there were
Orcas in San Juan Channel
. A couple of hours later another call from JB that
Orcas were in Upright Channel
, headed for the Lopez Ferry Dock. Then more news.
Orcas off the Orcas Ferry Dock
. That means they are headed west toward Speiden Is. We're at Lime Kiln Lighthouse and we do a 180 and head off toward Speiden. Half way up the Speiden we get a call from Kim and Karl who manage Lonesome Cove. They're looking at Orcas with their scope, right at Green Pt. In 5 minutes we're with them as they head west on the
north side of Spieden
.

A friend was riding the inter-island ferry from
Shaw to Orcas Island
and saw a group of
Orcas
swimming west in Harney Channel, about

12:30 pm
.

Capt. Engstrom of WS Ferries reported
10-12 orcas
in Harney Channel, just off Pt. Hudson, between
Shaw and Orcas Islands
, just after noon. The whales were headed west in Harney Channel, and there were at least two big males.
*
Just saw
5-6 Orcas
at

8:10
from the WSF. They were spread out traveling east near Reid Rock, just outside of
Friday Harbor
. We saw the leaders, so there could have been more. No id's, but a couple of nice tail kind and a pec slap!
