Orca Sightings for March 29, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit and Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research encountered
T185, T185A, T186, and T187
off
Sidney B.C
. (48째 40.19N, 123째 20.14 W) at

1:17 pm
. The whales appeared to be foraging most of the time and at approximately
2:15 they made a kill of an unknown species. There was a large slick with lots of diving gulls and milling whales. Lots of spyhops. The encounter ended just north of Coal Island (48째 42.08 N, 123째 22.54 W) at

4:07 p.m.
*
We saw a group of
transients
east of
Saturna Island
, as well as several sightings of a
minke whale
. No other boats were in the area. I will have to look at the photos some more, but is it possible that it was a group with T137 and 137A? I am not very experienced with ID photos, but the nicks on these two seem to match. I was checking the resident catalogue as well. I put a hydrophone down and heard nothing at first, but the second time we heard several calls. Some tail lobbing. Lots of birds feeding in the area of the whales.
