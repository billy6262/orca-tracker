Orca Sightings for March 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research was trying to get to Victoria again today when at
1241
he briefly spotted a group of about
six or seven killer whales
heading east in
Baynes Channel
. A ten minute search ensued, resulting in finding three whales that were surfacing to breathe at 7-9 minute intervals and traveling about one mile in a northwesterly direction up
Haro Strait
toward D'Arcy Island. These were
T2C, T2C1, and T2C2
(the scoliosis juvenile). The encounter ended at
1339
a little north of Zero Rock. Where did the others go? Jeanne Hyde called later and reported seeing T18, T19, T19B, and T19C heading east in
Speiden Channel
. Apparently, the group split into two groups at Baynes Channel with the latter four whales working the east side of Haro Strait and the first three whales working the west side of Haro Strait. No kills were observed during Ken's encounter.

Debbie Sharpe at the Center for Whale Research relayed a report from Ken Balcomb of
transient orcas
in
Baynes Channel
near Victoria. They were milling but generally moving northward toward Kelp Reef at

1:15 pm
.
*
Out with Capt. Brian on the Peregrine of Maya's Westside Charters for an afternoon trip at

1:00
. No sooner do we leave the harbor than we hear a report of [
orcas
] in
Haro Strait
. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research had spotted the whales.
Transients, the T2Cs
, 3 of them, were heading up the west side of
Haro Strait
. They were taking long dives and one time when 'they' surfaced they appeared to be 1 1/2 miles ahead with Kelp Reef marker in the background. However, when the T2Cs surfaced again they were only a short distance from us. We wondered if there were more whales. We went to
Spieden Channel
and happened upon more transients traveling east -
T18, T19, T19B and T19C
. The time difference from seeing 'those' whales 1 1/2 miles ahead of us, just south of Kelp Reef Marker, and seeing whales in Spieden Channel was 1 hour. Could they have been the same ones? The T2Cs were still in Haro Strait.

At the dinner table at

6:30 PM
this evening, a spout from a gray was seen out front, here, at
Mariners Cove
[east of
Oak Harbor
]. Heading southwest towards Polnell Point; about a hundred yards out from shore. Kept seeing the spouts and rolls, but was unable to keep up for first part. After 10 minutes, saw one spout, then another spout, couple seconds later. Wondered/was excited, two whales? Then, for next 10 minutes just one spout/one whale. Just northeast of Polnell, gray headed close to shore, stopped to feed, about 100 feet from shore. As gray fed, the surrounding water; churned, swirled, bubbled; while, feeding [on right side?] on ghost/sand shrimp. Then it went under and saw gray spout minute or two later, several hundred feet further on out. Suddenly the gray I was observing feeding came back up in same spot. IT HAD BEEN
TWO GRAYS
! While the one gray fed for twenty minutes the other was further out and kept 150/250 feet away the entire time and did not feed at all. Reminded me of last year; when two grays briefly met up for an hour or so and then, went their separate ways. Last spouts of both, still several hundred feet; apart, was observed as the sun set at

7:15PM
. Both, in the bay just north of Polnell Point.

We saw one
grey whale
just off the beach on President Point (NE Kitsap Peninsula, south of
Kingston, WA
) this morning about

8:30am
. It may have been feeding as it swam slowly to the north, just off the beach, turned and swam to the south, turned again before disappearing. We saw it come up and blow several times.
