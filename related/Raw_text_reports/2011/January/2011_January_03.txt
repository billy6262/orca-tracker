Orca Sightings for January 3, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our first encounter of 2011 occurred when Dave Ellifrit and Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research once again hopped aboard the Peregrine with Jim Maya to follow up on reports of Southern Residents inbound off Vancouver Island. Sure enough,
J's, K's and L87
were spotted off
Discovery Island
at

15:55
(48 44.40 N; 123 20.74 W), moving at a moderate pace up Haro Strait. The groups were spread out, and with only a little light left in the day, it was difficult to document all the whales present. However, our effort was rewarded with a spectacular sunset, and by the time it was over we had succeeded in photographing part of J pod (J2, J8, J19, J41, and the J14's), all of K pod, and of course, L87.

Thought I heard a whistle at

4:27 pm
on
Lime Kiln
hydrophone, then finally heard a clear call at

6:20 pm
on the
OrcaSound
hydrophones - now more faint calls - yay! By
6:30 pm, many reports on Facebook of people hearing the Southern Residents on the Orcasound hydrophones, and some calls on Lime Kiln.

Here's who I had in my photos from today:
J14, J19, J30, J36, J37, J40, J41, J45. K12, K13, K14, K16, K20, K21, K22, K25, K26, K27, K33, K34, K36, K37, K38, K40, K42, K43, and L87
. Other than K35, we saw all the K's. My pics were actually better than I expected-even content with my Mt. Baker shots! Nice way to start the New Year!

After receiving word this afternoon that whales were inbound, Capt. Jim of Maya's Westside Charters took several of us out to see who was there. We met the whales as they were heading north, up
Haro Strait
, at about
4pm
. We saw members of
J and K pods
and Onyx L87 who travels with them. We left them about about

4:45
still heading up Haro Strait. I would guess the whales were in the middle and west side of the strait. They were spread out for miles traveling in small groups. At

5:40 pm
I heard a few faint calls on the LK hydrophones. Then at
5:43 and for several minutes what sounded like S-4 calls on the Orca Sound hydrophones. A while later there were lots of K pod calls on the Orca Sound hydrophones. And then calls on both LK and OS hydrophones. I'll be posting some pictures of the encounter on my blog. Here's who I had:
J2 J8 J19 J41; J14 J30 J37 J40 J45; K12 K22 K33 K37 K43; K14 K26 K36 K42; K13 K20 K25 K27 K34 K38; K21 K40 and L87
.

What an evening on
Haro Strait
, off the West Side, San Juan Island. All the captains share info with each other, and so about

2:00
yesterday, I learned that members of
all three pods
were headed toward us from the West, just off of Victoria. Jeannie Hyde and I headed to the boat and waited for JB, Dave and Debbie from the Center for Whale Research, and Annie to show up. Our first blows were seen off of Discovery Is. BC about
1600
hrs. We got back to Snug with only a bit of light in the West.

Happy New Year to you all! What a wonderful New Years present ! Jan 3rd and it was an amazing afternoon in a Prince of Whales zodiac. The sun was shining and there was no wind for a change. The calm waters off
Victoria
made for ideal conditions. As far as the eye could see whales, whales and more whales! Members of the SR's
J, K and L Pods
were spread far across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Granny, J 2 and J 8, Spieden were our first whales and they both were porpoising after dare I say, their favourite food, Salmon. Youngsters, a couple that looked like J 42, Echo and J 41, Eclipse were traveling together, and J 30, Riptide was also seen . K 40, Raggedy and K 21, Cappuccino were seen close by. There were plenty of tall, male dorsal fins to be seen in every direction. Some of the Orca were close inshore while others traveled slowly coming in from the west and heading in a south east direction. Several would change directions while they foraged against an ebb tide. Others laid on their backs and slapped their pectoral flippers while facing the sunshine, almost as if embracing the moment.

Wooohoooo! Only the 3rd day of the new year and I got to see and hear whales today! Just my luck to get home and see an email from Jim Maya who heard from Jeanne Hyde who heard from Jeff Lamarche that Residents were in the area! For a change, I got the message in time, and quickly scooted down to Jim's boat. Off we went, and before we knew it, we were seeing blows just north of
Discovery Island
. Soon we were seeing fins and more fins. The rumors were true---we saw whales from
all 3 pods
! We didn't have much light, and the whales were very spread, so we just snapped a few photos of each group (see photo below) and moved on. It was so nice to be able to see some familiar fins!!!

Neat tail lobs, a spyhop and what looked like a headstand! They seemed to stay with a freighter passing by too!
