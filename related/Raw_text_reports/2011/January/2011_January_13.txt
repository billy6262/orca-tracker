2:10 pm
I began hearing faint
calls
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. Locating the whales took quite a while because fog rolled through, making visibility less than 2 miles. During that time calls could be heard on the LK Hps. Ivan Reiff heard some very brief calls on the Orca Sound hydrophones during the same time that he was hearing calls on the Lime Kiln Hps. Sometimes the calls are picked up on both hydrophones, however, he continued to hear calls on the Lime Kiln Hps and no other calls on the Orca Sound Hps. However, the Lime Kiln calls faded out long before we ever spotted the whales.
We were about 1/2 mile south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse and at about

3:15
I spotted one whale about a mile from shore, coming south in
Haro Strait
somewhere between County Park and Kelp Reef marker. Then a few minutes later 3 surfaced together. They were farther offshore and also heading south. They would dive for about 4 minutes and were traveling slowly. We believe there were
5 whales
present. A female and juvenile, two adult males and one either female or sprouter. The water was flat so it was relatively easy to track them. We watched the whales as they continued to travel south in Haro Strait and left them at about

4:05
. During our observation the whales were heading south, approaching Beaumont Shoals marker. The next time we saw them it looked as if some had gone ahead quite a distance. But then we saw at least one of the males still approaching the marker. We wondered out loud if there were more whales coming from the southeast or if they were after a meal. And then I saw two whales approaching from the southeast. After several minutes it appeared that they all were moving toward Sea Bird Pt. After getting home, I learned from Susan Berta that Debbie, from the Center for Whale Research, had seen another group of whales to the southeast of Beaumont Shoals marker at the same time she too was watching the 5 transients who were traveling south in Haro Strait. It makes me wonder if the calls heard on the LK hps were calls from the group to the southeast and the brief calls on the OS Hps were calls from the 5 coming south. I was still hearing T calls at
4:30 pm, louder at
4:52 pm, then the last transient calls I heard on the LK Hps were at
5:21pm.
