Orca Sightings for January 21, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had a short encounter with Transient orcas
T20 and T21
early afternoon after spotting them from shore south of
Victoria
. They were digesting lunch when I arrived as there was a small slick and several gulls around them while they milled about. I left them at

12:50
pointed north east as the forecasted strong westerly finally filled in.
