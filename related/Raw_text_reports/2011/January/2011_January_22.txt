Orca Sightings for January 22, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I heard a very faint
call
at

11:20 a.m
. and thought I would go look. I spotted a couple whales heading south in
Haro Strait
off Andrews Bay, about a1/2 mile from shore. Going south to Lime Kiln I was able to see them as they approached from the north at

11:38
. The first whale I photographed was
Raggedy K-40
. I saw members of Princess Angeline's family the
J17s
, members of Blossom (deceased)
J-11s
family, and members of Oreo's family the
J22s
. They headed down island and then spent over an hour foraging off Pile Pt. and False Bay from 1/2 off to 2 miles or more off shore. They then continued down island to Eagle Pt. staying at least a mile from shore. At
2:10 they grouped up and headed west toward Discovery Island. I last saw them at
3:20 pm. about 2 miles southeast of Beaumont Shoals marker in a couple groups. They appeared to be in a resting pattern at that time still heading west toward Discovery Island. At first glance it appears that
only the 3 J pod family groups were present
and
4 K pod whales - Raggedy K-40, Cappuccino K-21, Opus K-16 and Sonata K-35
, which is the same group (17 whales) who spent most of the 2010 season together. More of the story on my blog, where I will post exactly who I got pictures of on this encounter.

I was very excited this morning to hear from Jeanne via Ivan that there were [
orcas
] on the west side of the island (YAHOO!). I raced out to
Land Bank
at around

12:00
and there they were! They were quite offshore and very spread out, but it was so wonderful to see them. I had zero cameras or binoculars with me so I couldn't get any ID's although I do know they were residents. I later talked to Jeanne and discovered that we had been watching a smattering of
J's and K's
. We went down to Hannah Heights and saw that there was some foraging going on at Pile Point. They seemed to be just hangin' out there.
