============================================================

Entry 1:
At

1:00 pm
, 3/4 mile N. of Pudding Creek inlet,
Fort Bragg, CA
. Pod of
20 to 25 Orcas
,approximately 400 yds offshore, traveling on the surface at a steady pace South and a little West. No pictures. Orcas were spread pretty much in a line, 4 or 5, then 3, then 4 etc. but all within a line of about 2 hundred yards in length. They seemed to know where they were going. Moved at a steady pace.

11:25 am
- Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales in Seattle reported
6 - 8 orcas
, likely Transients, in the
Seattle/Bainbridge ferry lanes
, closer to the Seattle side. Pod included 1 adult male, 2 sprouters, 1 young one. Jeff was able to get some photos and said he had "some suspicions" about who they could be. Upon receiving the photos taken by Jeff Hogan off Seattle, Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research replies: My first guess would be the L12's. Maybe L22 and L79 and L89? but tough to say with the distance.

Orca Network received a call this
morning
from "Alex," relaying a report from someone on the
Bamfield-Port Alberni ferry
who saw several
orcas
at Uchucklesit Inlet (48 59 N by 125 W). The original reporting party, a passenger on the ferry, said that at
10 AM
this morning there were several orcas including a bull with a severed dorsal fin. He said the wound was "fresh" but we have no further details.
