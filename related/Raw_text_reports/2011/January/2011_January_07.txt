Orca Sightings for January 7, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a rare clear and sunny day in January, vocalizations from the Southern Residents could be heard on the OrcaSound hydrophone. Dave Ellifrit and Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research encountered the [
orcas
] at

12:22
in
Haro Strait
(48 33.99N; 123 11.72W). The whales were widely spread in Haro Strait. Under rough sea conditions, it was difficult to photograph all the whales present. We observed members of
J's, K's, and L87
. In general, the whales were moving in a SW direction, but each group seemed to be zig-zagging as they made their way toward Victoria. By the end of the encounter, at
14:20however, the smaller groups joined up and we were able to get a couple group shots before they departed. The whales were left halfway between San Juan and Victoria, just over the Canadian border (48 26.80N; 123 11.32W) .

5:20 a.m.
transients calls
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. The calls continued intermittently until shortly after
8:a.m
. Another few calls were heard at about
10a.m.
and then at

11:42
more transients calls were heard on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. However, at the very same time
Resident calls
began on the
Orca Sound
hydrophones. Ivan Reiff drove the Peregrine of Maya's Westside Charters and on board were me and Dave and Debbie from the Center for Whale Research. We saw members of
J and K pods and Onyx L-87
as they came south in
Haro Strait
. They were several miles offshore heading toward Discovery Island. When I returned home a short while after
3:00, I could still hear faint Resident calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. Then at about
4:30 pm. I heard a few transients calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones. I didn't hear anymore after
4:27.

The Center for Whale Research was with the
Southern Residents
from

12:27 pm
off Smuggler's Cove, NW
San Juan Island
, until

2:18 pm
when they were about mid-way between San Juan Island and Victoria, just across the border into Canadian waters.

Ron Bates of MMRG in Victoria reports via Facebook that the
Southern Residents
heard and sighted today were the same group of
Js, Ks & L87
that headed north on the 4th.
An update from Ron: Whales outbound were half of
J's most of K's and only L87
. Some
Transients
seemed to be behind the pack.

1:07 pm
:
Orcas
have been trickling by, slowly making their way south in
Haro Strait
. They are pretty far away from the western shore of San Juan Island, making it difficult to see them from land.

There were
