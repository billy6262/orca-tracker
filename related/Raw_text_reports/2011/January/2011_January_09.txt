I didn't know of any whales in the area on
January 9th. Js and Ks had been last seen two days before, heading west. Then at

4:27 pm
I heard a few
calls
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
and then silence. About 20 minutes later calls were heard on the Orca Sound hydrophones.
J and K pod calls
. The last calls faded into the distance at about

5:45 p.m
.

On Saturday morning at
~11AM
, a group of
8-10 orcas
came through
Active Pass.
They appear to have come down through Trincomali channel, entering Georgeson Bay and assuming the usual route of our residents, hugging the Mayne Island coastline near Helen Point and then crossing to the Galiano side as they approached Matthews Point. Very tightly grouped, they seemed to be in a hurry to get wherever they were going.
