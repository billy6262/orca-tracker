Orca Sightings for January 23, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
After getting a tip that there were Residents inbound by Trial Island, Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research boarded the Peregrine and headed out to observe the pod. The group of
19 whales
(encountered at

13:30
, at 48 25.49N; 123 11.30W, was a mixture of J's and K's, which included
J11's, J17' s and J22's
, as well as
K21,K40,K16 and K35
. These were the same whales that had been observed the day before off San Juan Island. As the whales headed in, crossing Haro Strait, they were initially headed east, in two separate groups, but eventually joined and started traveling NE at a slow rate toward False Bay. They left the whales at
14:40 at 48 25.92N; 123 08.41W.

Jeanne Hyde, in response to my email about hearing strange whale calls on the OrcaSound hydrophones: Been listening to them since

5:48
. I too thought they sounded strange. but then I have heard several
J pod calls
, the Creaking Door call as I call it and lots of echo locating, so I think it's the Js and Ks that came up a while ago. but I haven't heard any of the K pod signature 'kitten' calls.
and later: I wondered if we were hearing transients before we were hearing the residents. I noticed that some of those strange calls were distant at the same time there were echolocation clicks happening closer to the OrcaSound hydrophones.. And the strangest thing was that it seemed to me that the strange calls stopped and pretty soon 'all of a sudden' I began hearing the 'normal' resident calls - like we'd expect. I recorded a lot of it, so will be listening again to see if my memory serves me correctly or not! It sure was interesting listening whoever it was. I just don't remember ever hearing residents making such long low ton calls as those.

I got a call that [
orcas
] were in the Strait of Juan de Fuca heading toward San Juan Island. I went out on the Peregrine of Maya's Westside Charters with three others and with Capt. Ivan driving. We met up with the whales south of Discovery Island heading in a southeast direction. After a short while they adjusted their course to a more north easterly direction. Near Lime Kiln Lighthouse at

4:55 pm
were the
J11s, J17s, J22s and Cappuccino K-21, Raggedy K-40, Opus K-16 and Sonata K-16
passed by going north in a resting pattern. Tall fin is
Blackberry J-27
, fin tip on left is
Tsuchi J-31
, juvenile whale in middle is
Cookie J-38
and on right is
Oreo J22
,
Polaris J-28
and her offspring
Star J-46
,
Oreo J-22
,
Cookie J-38
and
Rhapsody J-32
,and
Mako J-39
.. As I was writing this (~
6:40 pm) I heard the whales on the
Orca Sound
hydrophones both
calls
and echolocation clicks. I was able to account for all the family members of these three family groups in J pod. These three groups hadn't been seen since early December. We left them at
2:40 a few miles offshore of San Juan Island heading in a northeasterly direction. A friend had also been out on his boat and when he left the whales they were headed for False Bay. At about
4:15 pm I went looking. After searching a while I spotted them. The 4 K pod whales, the J17s, J11s and the J22s were in a resting pattern less than 200 yards from shore at Lime Kiln lighthouse heading up island. I last saw them as they were approaching Andrews Bay, still heading north at
5:25 pm. More of the encounters today will be posted on my blog here.
