I had the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
on while on Facebook & heard some
calls
at about

7:45-
7:50 pm
pacific time. Not sure which pod was coming through though. Still learning their calls.

I've just been outside (~
6 pm
) and came in to see if you had any reports. There are what sounds to be breaches out there (Hannah Heights, west
San Juan Island
) ---so now I know I wasn't going nuts! I heard the breaches south of me, and if Susan started hearing calls thereafter, I suspect North.

Orca Network got a report via Cascadia Research from Joe Wolkott that the wayward
bottlenose dolphin
(assuming it's the same one) that was seen in the south Sound in December and January, was seen Sunday in Saratoga Passage, 100' from Bell's Beach north of Langley, Whidbey Island. The neighbor says it has been there off and on since Thursday. It breached 3' out of the water.
