Orca Sightings for January 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw perhaps
3 or 4 orcas
in
Hales Pass
which is between Fox Island and Gig Harbor, WA (47 degrees north, 122 degrees west)- the south end of the Puget Sound. They were swimming southeast and just seemed to be traveling. It was about

3:15
this afternoon. I wasn't close enough to see anything else like markings.

Orca Network found this
CA Transient orca
report from the
Malibu
Times online here. Orca whales seen off Malibu's coast. A pod of
five to eight orca whales
, also known as killer whales, was seen about a mile off the coast of Malibu by a group of whale watchers Sunday. Local whale watchers got to take dozens of photos of the playful animals.
A reply from Alisa Schulman-Janiger with IDs for some of the orcas:
From the first few images that have come in, I have confirmed
CA51B and CA51C
. Most likely 6 of these whales were the
CA51s
(who have a very young calf). There may have been another matriline present. I spoke to Tyler Vanderlip today (deckhand), who estimates that there were 6-9 killer whales present.
