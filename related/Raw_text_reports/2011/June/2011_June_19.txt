Out around the bend heading north along the west side of San Juan Island towards
False Bay
, we found the mother lode:
orcas
! Word through the vessel radio grapevine was that we had a mixture of J and K pods, with a possible identification of J30 ("Riptide"). One potential reason for resident pods to intermingle is to swap DNA and expand each pod's gene pool in hopes of creating viable and successful offspring; kind of important when you're an endangered species and on "THE LIST". Leaving the whales to their continued intermingling and love trysts, we cruised back along the west side to find an empty Bald eagles' nest at Long Island.

We followed a few members of
J Pod
southbound starting at
Deception Pass
today around

12:15
. About 2 solid hours with them and a great "encounter" with Tahlequa and her calf (J35 & J47) to boot can be seen here on this video.

Around
7 pm
we saw
at least six Orcas
in the entrance to
Discovery Bay
, between Cape George and Diamond Point. There was at least one male and two others swimming very close together, perhaps a mother and baby. We saw several good jumps. These are only the second group of Orcas I have seen in ten years living on Discovery Bay.

We had a delightful and surprising encounter with a group of
15 Transient Orcas
near Beaumont Shoals. Within he group there was two large males one of which had a very distinctive dorsal fin. We followed the group as they moved swiftly north in
Haro Strait
and were nearing Lime Kiln Lighthouse when we left them.
Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching, Victoria, B.C.
These orcas were identified as T170 and T171, by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island, WA - and Rod Palm of Strawberry Isle Research says, " wow! Rare animals for us on the West Coast: we've only seen them twice in over 20 years."
*
We saw approximately
6 adult orcas and one calf
in
Brentwood Bay, B.C
. around

11:30am
. The mother and calf stayed around for at least 1/2 hour. They moved slightly west in the bay before we lost sight of them. We were wondering which pod this might be and how old the calf might be? The calf seemed very small.

A
Humpback
whale has been hanging out in the
South Sound
. The photographer Jim Komonce was fishing with me this
morning
when the Humpback breached a few times just East of Gig Harbor. We watched it for about 15 minutes before it headed North into
Colvos Passage
. I also spotted this whale Saturday while traveling though the Tacoma Narrows at Salmon Beach with my clients from Texas. What an awesome site.
Captain Jim Keith, Fox Island Salmon Charters

We've been watching a whale travel up and down
Colvos passage
this past week. Based on the small dorsal fin located on the lower part of the back, I would guess that this was a Minke whale.
Ken Warter
Given other reports and the photo above, we believe this is actually the
Humpback whale
that has been in the area - ON

9:35 am:
Over
30 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
