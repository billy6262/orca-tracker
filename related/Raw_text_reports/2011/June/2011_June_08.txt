From there we headed across the border at
Boundary Pass
and had everyone on board helping us look for signs of
orca
. Spread out from just about East Point all the way to Turn point we had orca! There were so many that we had the ability to watch one group for a while, and then observe another group, and then another. One lucky passenger even got a picture of a spyhop!

We were very delighted to see
J-Pod
orcas heading west, with the small ebbing tide in
Boundary Pass
, closer to Saturna Island, Canada, at about

1:45pm
. They were spread out from shore to about halfway out in the pass. J-2 Granny was in the lead, all by herself. Happy 100th Birthday! and poignant seeing her without J-1 Ruffles. Following J-2, I think J-8 Spieden was in the next group of 2 to 3 killer whales with J-26 Mike. The wonderful sunshine reflected off of their backs, making it hard to identify saddle patches. There were 2 more males with groups out in the pass, then J-30 Riptide with a calf and 2 females swam near shore and looked like they may be hunting salmon in the reef-rock rips as they circled a bit and the youngster did a tail fluke slap. It's close to
3pm
now, time to head back, when the calf spy hops and breaches!
