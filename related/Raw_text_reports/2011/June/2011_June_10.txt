Orca Sightings for June 10, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
An update from the NOAA Fisheries Research Team: We got our first Dtag out yesterday on
J30
. It recorded just under six hours of data.

Reports of
L-Pod orcas
south of
San Juan Island
, and
J-Pod orcas
heading north with the small flood tide in
Haro Strait
, led us through Spieden Channel where we started to see whales right about
1pm
! Now it was slack water, the whales where swimming leisurely in tight groups, I wonder if they were resting a bit. As they approached the south end of Stuart Island they began to spread out, become more active. A young killer whale spy hopped, then the youngsters started breaching about 8 times (see photo below), with 2 of the whales coming out of the water at the same time, leaving twin splashes!! They did this twice! A few tail fluke slaps as they swam closer to shore. Then
J-27
Blackberry and a female starting circling, making several direction changes, hunting for salmon! At Turn Point, the orcas decided to go right, into Boundary Pass, we left them heading northeast. Able to ID
J-17, J-22 with J-38 & J-32, J-27, J-34, J-28, J-14, J-26
.

We met up with members of
J pod
just south of Stuart Island around

12:45
today. They were separated into a few tight groups, one with about 10 individuals (including 2 calves), slowly swimming northwest together.
J27
Blackberry then turned back and did some 'evasive surface maneuvers' probably chasing a salmon. Two juveniles began breaching (one followed by another) as they reached Turn Point.

11:00 a.m
.
J pod and L87
went north past
Lime Kiln lighthouse
, some in close and the majority in a large group about 1/2 mile from shore. About 30 minutes later two L pod whales (based on the calls over the Hps) came south past the light. In looking at my images I discovered that
Lulu L-53
was one of the whales in close to shore traveling with some of the J pod whales. Of course Onyx L87 was still with J pod later to the north, but Lulu was not with them, so she was most likely one of the two who came south past the light.

2:30 pm
: The
Transient Orca
were again spotted by Breton Islands, Hoskyn Channel. the ferry was kind enough to report this sighting to Aaron, Campbell River Whale Watching. The whales did, however disappear somewhere and were not spotted by the afternoon tours.
Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC , Powell River, B.C.

9:40 am
:
4 to 5 Orca
between Marina Island and Francisco Point in a general Southward direction closer to Quadra Island. There was one large male, possibly T102.
From: Garry, Aboriginal Journeys - The two above reports submitted by Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, B.C.

Late Report that around
12 Orca
were Southbound down by Black Point, south of
Powell River
late in the day. (This is unconfirmed, but looking at the photos of yesterday's whales, they are different Transients than the ones from today)

1:45 pm
: Approximately
50 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
were by Mitlenatch Island. From Aaron,

We saw a pod of
3 or 4 orcas
from the tssawassen-salt spring ferry around
8pm
. The orcas were located around the eastern exit of the
active pass
, and were apparently heading east in the straight of georgia, although they were quite far and we lost them when the ferry got into galiano island harbour.

Orcas (Lpod)
heading west past
Clover Point, Victoria BC
appoximately
5 pm
.
Maria Chantelle Tucker, Victoria, B.C.

We soon found a large pod of orcas who turned out to be
J-pod
! Rather than traveling at a quick pace, they were spread out and swimming in smaller groups towards the east. With passengers' photos, we were able to identify two males--Mike and Blackberry--and a female, Spieden. We saw the whales breaching and even a spy-hop from one particularly curious individual. While we were out with the whales, we learned that a research group had just placed a suction-cup tag on the male J-30, Riptide and were hoping to put a tag on a second whale.

Sandy Buckley on San Juan Island just reported
L pod
heading north off
Hannah Heights
at
2 pm
.
J pod
is milling at
Turn Pt
, LOTS of Ls are heading very slowly north - the calls we're now hearing at Lime Kiln are the leaders from L pod, they are spread out down to Hanah Heights, could also possibly be some Js mixed in with them. And now (
2:10 pm) Sandy says they have turned south again - doing the West side shuffle! At

1:55 pm
we're still hearing some faint
calls
on
Lime Kiln
.
