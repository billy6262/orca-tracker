Orca Sightings for June 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a resident pod of
orcas
. There were at least 10 near
Hobart Bay, AK
near the five fingers lighthouse. I had a large male and a baby or two at one point. there were several Dall'sporpoises swimming a few feet in front of and behind for at least 5 minutes. That led us to believe that they were not transients as the porpoises had no fear and seemed to be playing.

About

4:30 PM
we again had a
gray whale
feeding close to shore on the high tide. I had been gone all day and as I drove in the driveway the neighbor alerted me that there was a gray whale feeding off our bluff. The light was just right to really seeing the rolling motion as it would blow, then roll on its side to feed, with much pec waving. After an extended snack, the whale then headed south rapidly, only to stop and feed again in a favorite spot several lots down. Barbara Brock, Mabana,
Camano Island

Transient orcas T87, T90s, and T124A1s
near
Race Rocks, BC.
between

2:30 and
3:30
. They usually don't act like residents, but they were yesterday. We spent an hour watching them move into the 6 kt. flood tide and they didn't move.
