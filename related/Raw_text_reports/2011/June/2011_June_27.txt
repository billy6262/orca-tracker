0 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
by Eagle's Cove in Discovery Channel being playful and chasing herring which were seen leaping out of the water as the Dolphins fed on them. - Garry, Aboriginal Journeys
9 am

Campbell River
Whale Watching of a pod of
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
close to Separation Head, by Seymour Narrows.
The dolphins have been hanging around at Grief Point since just before 9 o'clock. Apparently feeding but not moving anywhere. They reappeared here just after 4 but a much smaller group. They gamboled around out front here until around
4:30. Then they appeared to split and some headed south east towards Vananda and the others north towards the mill. (Powell River)

Around
3 pm
a glimpse of
Transient Orca
blows mid-strait still very slowly headed towards Atrevida Reef, North of Powell River. I watched them till about
1:15 and they seemed to be headed north towards Atrevida Reef about mid channel. They continued to play every so often with 3 more breaches, lots of tail lobbing and a couple of nice spy hops. There were at least 6 Orca and possibly up to 8 of them with two males and at least one calf. Certainly there was one extremely large male whose tail, when he tail slapped, looked almost as large as a small Humpback's tail. There were breaches, head stands waving tails in the air, tail slaps, spy hops, etc. etc. Then they suddenly decided to give the ferry and boat traffic a great show. They stayed out in front of
Powell River
slowly working their way towards Harwood Island for a good couple to three hours while they socialized.
10:50 am: The call came in that there were at least three Orca around the Myrtle Rocks area South of Powell River heading Northward.

Up around Saturna Island, we went into the
Strait of Georgia
where we finally found [
orcas
]. We spent much of our time going back and forth across the border as we observed
J-pod and L87
, a large male named "Onyx" with a solid white saddle patch on his right side and a black-indented saddle patch on his left side. The pod was fairly spread out, with a pair (female and calf?) towards the north and another pair southwest of us. While we were powered down, a pair of females/juveniles/both came by our stern within one hundred and fifty yards and passed under us, popping back up off our port bow! We only knew they had surfaced by the sound of their blows.

I saw a whale out there (
Pt. No Point, N. Kitsap
) today. I heard a loud sound from the water and saw the top fin, then the large tail. It was quite dark, almost like the porpoise, but with that huge pronounced tail, it definitely wasn't a porpoise. This was around

3:30 or
3:45 p.m
. The whale was seen around it three or four more times. The first two sightings were around maybe 100 yards out? The second two or three probably double that distance, headed north, into deeper water. I lost sight of it after that.
Joy Jaber, Hansville/Pt. No Point, N. Kitsap Peninsula, WA
We've had multiple reports of this whale and are sure it's the same
humpback
that has been in the area between Pt. No Point and Kingston/Edmonds for several weeks now - ON
*
Saw a whale just south of the northern tip of the
Kitsap peninsula
on the east side in
Skunk Bay
at

10:15 am.
It was swimming in shallow water, probably less than 20 feet deep, north bound. Smallish dorsal fin, darker in color- more gray black and solid color. No pectoral fin shown.
(after sending a photo of the
humpback
dorsal fin Chuck confirmed that was the type of whale he saw
).
