Orca Sightings for June 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we watched a beautiful sunset around

9:30 pm
from a Fox Cove mooring buoy at Sucia Island, to our surprise we watched a
transient group of four Orcas
enter from the west and exit through the narrow southern opening. An adult male, a female and two juveniles. Perfect ending to a perfect day.

No Resident Orcas today, yet around

1:35pm
we come across another group of
4 Transient Killer Whales
! A male T-56, with a female, juvenile and calf. He is an orphan, so hard to ID who he was with. They are swimming fairly slowly with that strong flood tide, in a tight group on long dives, north then east around
Sucia Island
.

Orca Network received a call from Alexia at

12:40 pm
- she was watching 2 orcas, a Mom and calf, off the north side of
Sucia Island
(northwest of
Orcas Island)
, heading east.
*
There were at least
4 Transients
at Burial Island in
Sansum Narrows
this afternoon around
3-4 PM
. They headed North. There were about 6 whale watching boats out, including the Prince of Whales, whom I am sure can Identify them. We watched from shore.

A group of
5 Transient orcas
were located heading west, just north of Portland Island. The group has been id'ed as
T10, T10B, T10C, T26, and T26A
. Shortly after we arrived at about
1230
, the group changed direction - a seal hunt was on. They took one seal, then logged on the surface for a short time before resuming the hunt for a second seal. The second seal was still alive when we left at approximately
13:30. Photo below of T26A with an impressive show of power and spray.

Today we left the harbor and headed north toward
Sucia Island
. Once there we spotted a small pod of
transients
. There were 3. One female, one male, and one calf. They were taking long dives with a few breaths at their surface intervals before they dove again. They were cruising along, with one quick stop that I thought might have been a hunting opportunity, but after a brief spyhop from the big male they continued along their merry way. When we first saw them they were on the east side of the island. When we left them it looked as though they were about to complete their circumnavigation as they turned the corner and headed up the west side.

Connie Barrett of Camano Island called at

7:27 pm
to say she & her husband were watching one or more
gray whales
in
Saratoga Passage
, off Cama Beach heading south. The whale(s) were staying down for 10 - 15 minutes between surfacing - all they could see were the spouts, so couldn't confirm species but thought they were likely grays. We tried to find them, but didn't have time to look much and missed them as they passed by Greenbank.
