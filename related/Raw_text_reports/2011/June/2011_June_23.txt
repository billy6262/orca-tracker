Bumpy day today on the west side of San Juan! We got soaked on the way down but it was worth it! We spotted a small group of
J's
around
False Bay
, one of which was J26. The water was pretty choppy so ID's were difficult but J26 did a couple bellyflops for us which made it a bit easier. Here's a picture of it.

We headed south out of Friday Harbor - just before we reached
Lime Kiln
we saw what we were looking for, the
killer whales
were up ahead. It was J pod! We slowly made our way across watching the whales who were spread out so there were different individuals passing us. One of the calves was especially playful lob tailing, and at one point breached out of the water. It was a spectacular view!

Lots of great
Orca calls
, possibly J Pod on Lime
Kiln
right now at
4pm
. Always good to hear especially having seen them two hours ago. I was out earlier on the Ocean Magic out of Victoria at noon, and saw several Orca, J pod and L87 foraging and heading north toward the park off
San Juan Island
in choppy seas and windy conditions.

1546
: So. Resident
orca calls
(S1, S2s) on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
now. First autodetections were recorded at 1448 and no autodetections were recorded at Orcasound in last few hours, so assume they are headed north (toward Orcasound hydrophones

Calls
and echolocation at
Lime Kiln.

Lime Kiln.

At exactly the same time as Tuesday,
7am
, we had five or more
orcas
off the
Anacortes
ferry landing, heading west again! One male and the rest females or young.Larry saw two spyhops through the spotting scope but I missed them. They were spread out.

humpback
. Resurrection bay three miles west of cape. Last couple days been 7 super pods in Puget bay. Went out yesterday didn't see one orcas but lots of humpies where close to where they got it today.

We saw
4 transients
a few miles outside of
Moss Landing
-- one calf, one juvenile, one female & a male. When we found them there were tons of birds and the male swam right for us carrying a huge slab of blubber from an elephant seal. It looked like he was holding it between his pec fins!! The group was really active; tail slapping, pec slapping, and the calf breached several times. The whales turned their attention to a fulmar and spent a great deal of time harassing it by slapping it with their tails and dragging it under water. They left it alone, barely alive, and moved on to another fulmar a few minutes later. They at least put the second one out of it's misery! What was really interesting was when a live fulmar scurried over to the dead fulmar and pecked at it a few times, almost like it was trying to see if it was okay.
