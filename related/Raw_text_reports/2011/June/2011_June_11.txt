Powell River

Lots of
Dall's Porpoises
: Between

2:20 pm and 3 pm
- Some came by to bow ride for a short run close to Hole in the Wall, Calm Channel, then another two were spotted by Rendezvous Islands and another 5 zipped about as we started to head down Whale Channel (or is that Whale Passage? - SM) from Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of
Powell River
BC
*

9:20 am: a Harbour Porpois
e was spotted by Squirrel Cove, Cortez Island just before we heard the Orca were behind us and we turned back to locate them. From Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of
Powell River
BC
*
I saw all those
Harbor Porpoise
again. From
5-6 pm
watched at least a couple dozen spread out mid channel in small groups in Puget Sound and southern Possession sound. Watched from
Edmonds
as they foraged, presumably on those thousands of little jumping fish that cover the water.
Alisa Lemire Brooks, Shoreline, WA

6 pm
: Received an update via Jack, Campbell River Whale Watching that Jen saw Dusty the
Gray Whale
in Seymout Narrows heading Northward. Earlier in the day, around 2 pm, someone over the radio said there was a Gray Whale out in front of the Rona Store in Campbell River.

~
9:45 pm
: pretty sure I just saw a lone male
orca
heading north up through the
gulf islands
, around otter bay area whilst i was on the ferry to Victoria from Vancouver, B.C.

8 pm: 5 Transient Orca
(same ones from earlier in the day) by Atrevida Reef then Harwood Island then Westview,
Powell River
heading Southward towards Grief Point. Looked like they had a snack when they were closer to Harwood Island. I received a couple of "can you see them" calls thanks to John & Joan T. and Steve G. Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC , Powell River, B.C.

T68's
in Browning Passage and up
Tofino Inlet
last night at
6pm
.
Claire Mosley
*

2:30 pm
and 3 pm reports of
Orca
by Savary Island, Mace Point then closer to the Iron Mines on the mainland side. Looked like they were heading in a Northerly direction. (These were the same Transient whales that were seen earlier in the day as well as the ones that headed South this evening. - SM)

Two Transient Orca
Encounters with the same group: After entering Bute Inlet,
1 pm
we saw the second group of
5 Transient Orca
headed against the tidal rapids at Aaron Rapids. As Jack put it "an Orca Jacuzzi" with the whirlpools running. They were taking their time going through, when a little Harbour Seal drifted in, never noticing that he was headed straight into these meat hunters. The orca had their snack. The whales made it through the narrows, down past Sonora Lodge then turned back up into Bute Inlet to do it again. Around
2:45 pm they took, in spectacular fashion, I'm told, a Harbour Porpoise, again in Aaron Rapids. These Orca were left still up in that area when Garry left them.

9:30 am: 5 Transient Orca
just South of Twin Islands and Baker Pass between Cortez and Hernando Islands. We watched as they breached, tail lobbed and rested. There were a few vocals in between boat noise. They were between Powell Islets and Bliss Landing, by the Copeland (Ragged - local name) Islands when we left then still slowly working towards Sarah Point around

11:30 am

Tucker (Univ. of WA's trained whale-scat detecting dog) was looking pretty chipper off
Eagle Point
today sniffing for anything left behind by well spread out foraging members of
J pod
...
Sandra Pollard SSAMN, Freeland, Whidbey Island, WA
*
As the sun dissipated
the daunting clouds, we encountered
J-Pod
near
Pile Point
as they headed north toward Lime Kiln Point. A few individuals breached while the rest of the group continued to move at a slow pace in a spread out formation. We were excited to identify Riptide (J-30), the alleged great-grandson of Granny (J-2), who is believed to be 100 years old and the eldest female of the entire Southern Resident Community!

Gray whales (?) having fun splashing around just south of our house, west of
mutiny bay
. Out pretty far but busy at the surface, lots of spouts and wallowing around. We could see 4 at one time all playing close together. I thought maybe humpbacks cause they were so long, but I didn't know we were getting them already. 4 maybe more, which made me think maybe grays after all...anybody's guess. They were too far to see close except with binocs and telescope.
Barbara Mundell, Bush Pt, Freeland,
Whidbey Island
, WA
hmmm - hard to tell on this one. Usually splashing/wallowing behavior is only seen by Gray whales when they are feeding close to shore in shallow water; and we have had very few Grays reported lately, I don't think there are more than 2 left around these waters now...however, there HAVE been several reports of 1 or 2 humpbacks in the area, especially around Mutiny and Useless Bays, near where this sighting took place. My best GUESS is that these were
humpbacks

~
4 pm
: the
calls
on
lime kiln
right now, are those humpbacks?

The
common dolphin
that was reported off
Olympia
last Sunday is still in the area as of this morning. The individual seems to be actively feeding, although has a heavy growth of algae.
