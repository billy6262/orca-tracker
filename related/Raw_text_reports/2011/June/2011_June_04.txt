Orca Sightings for June 4, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We encountered at least
80-100 Harbor porpoises
feeding amidst feeding puffins in the current right of the south-east end of
Lopez Island, WA
from

16:50 -
17:40
. The number is even conservative! (I have counted harbor porpoises for my PhD work in Norway over 6 years almost every day). The porpoises were very active, leaping and spread over at least a 1 mile area - quite impressive activity for those little guys. Those group feeding events are really fun to listen to if you have a porpoise detector - lots of buzzing activity (those buzzes are really very fast click trains just before they actually catch a fish). I just thought you might want to know about this event anyway - all the best,

1:50 pm
: Garry found the
5 Transient Orca
who seem to have a preference for staying in and around that area. They were found by Viner Point, Read Island heading slowly towards
Quadra Island BC
across Sutil Channel. At
3:30 pm they were last reported close to the Cape Mudge Lightstation.

11:45 am: 5 Orca

Christy Hynde-Bank (formerly known as 'Johnny Rotten') and calf appeared briefly off
Salmon Bank
around
2.00 pm
, some distance away from three other
minkes
keen to show themselves and hang around for a while. It was a delight to see the fine, pointed rostrum of the elusive minke as one surfaced to give passengers on Mystic Sea a rare treat.

Getting further south from the
Haro Strait
into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, we started to see seabirds. Then more and more seabirds. And with those seabirds there were
Minke whales
! With the perfectly flat calm water and light breezes, we could hear the Minke's exhale. All in all we saw
four whales
, with six reported in the area (one off of Lopez Island and three to five off of Salmon bank). Based on their zigzagging travel motions and their head and rostrum rises, the Minke whales appeared to be foraging, sharing fish with the seabirds. On the way home, we saw steller sea lions, harbor seals and several more harbor porpoises.

Beautiful day on the water with abundant sunshine and calm seas in
Haro Strait
. Passengers on the Peregrine were thrilled to see
three Minke Whales
closely grouped & actively feeding.

Lori Willson called at

4:22 pm
from the
Kingston
ferry dock to say she saw the bushy blows of the
humpback
out in mid-channel between Edmonds and Kingston. Later she wrote: Watched him or her the whole time I was in the ferry holding area but never found him/her from the boat. The big cruise ships were all steaming through at about the same time and I wonder if he/she got out of there until they passed.
