Orca Sightings for June 5, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to some photos recently received, we have identified the mystery marine mammal sighted near
Boston Harbor
and Burfoot Beach as a
common dolphin
, a species that is not commonly found in Washington waters. From the photos we were not able to tell if it is a short or long-beaked common dolphin. Thanks for sending in the sightings!

I saw what I believe was a
Minke whale
. It was in the Canadian waters between
Port Angeles and Victoria
in the vicinity of Coyote Bank. It was feeding, heading in an easterly direction. There were also lots and lots (perhaps 150) of harbor porpoises between Victoria and Anacortes.

Around

16:00
my wife and I were headed back to Des Moines Marina from
Maury Island
lighthouse area when we encountered
2 Minke Whales
in front of our boat. We were probably 75-100 yards away from them the first time they surfaced as they traveled south toward Saltwater State Park. Garrett Lee, Seattle, WA

We had reports of a
humpback
out off
Constance Bank
. It didn't take long for the massive adult to come to the surface, and the long blows would echo across the water. But unlike my previous experiences with humpbacks, this one would take 2 short dives, dive for about a minute or two and then surface again (see photo below). It was almost as if it were in some type of resting pattern, as it made very little headway in it's travel. Too soon it was time to head back, but we did manage to find some time to compare this Mysticete with another--a
minke whale
that was actively feeding near
Salmon Bank
.

We headed out toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca on glassy, calm water. After an hour of eye-straining binocular use a blow appeared in the distance. A large, dark body rose to the surface. My old friend the
humpback
whale. Knowing the humpback's penchant for lengthy dives I started to explain the incredible breath holding abilities of the species. Just then, as if to prove me wrong, the whale surfaced. On the way back in we spotted another black body at the surface. This time there was no visible exhalation, which could only mean...
minke
. Species number two! As we were moving in for a better look a
second Minke
surfaced about 200 yards off our starboard side.

Gray Whale
sighted feeding 2 1/2 miles north of
Langley
headed south about
830p
. We watched him for a good 45mins as he slowly makes his way south towards Langley!

1800-1830 Bells Beach: Grey
with LOTS of speckled white on his body and L flipper was more than 50% bright white. Fed for 30 plus minutes heading towards Langley.
