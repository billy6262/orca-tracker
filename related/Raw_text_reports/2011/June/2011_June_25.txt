Orca Sightings for June 25, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I viewed
2-4 Orcas
off of
Alldridge Point, East Sooke Park in Victoria
. 1 male for sure. They were far off for me but I was able to look through binoculars. 1 whale watching boat had a look and carried on.

Orca Network received a call from David Smith, a WA state fish-checker. He had reports from 3 different boats who had sighted
orcas
, about 10 miles north of
LaPush
: 1st boat: 2 adults & 1 calf. 2nd boat: 2 adults & 2 calves.
*
I saw about
15 orcas
today swimming south past
Lime Kiln State park
at

3:00 pm
. I'm pretty sure it was J-pod. Lots of breaching, lobtailing, and surface activity. Three of the orcas came within 15 yards of the shore! An excellent day for whale watching!

We headed north into Canadian waters where the orcas were last sighted, to the
Strait of Georgia
. It took us over an hour to get there, but at last, killer whales! There were many
orcas
, perhaps two pods, spread out over a large distance. We stayed to the outside of the group and observed a trio with an individual lob tailing and even saw a three spy hops! Our passengers then realized that there was another group of six or seven whales about 400 hundred yards off the other side of our boat.

2.00 pm
- An occasional breach, a cartwheel or two and some tail slaps from spread out members of
J pod
south of
False Bay, San Juan Island
. Tucker the scat dog, in his bright yellow life vest, was sniffing the air with interest and earning his keep.

So. Resident orca
(S4) calls
on the
Orcasound
hydrophone. First clicks auto-detected at
0852
. There were none at Lime Kiln since
6:30, so southbound again? Lots of back and forth between Lime Kiln and Orcasound last night, though, so maybe just spread out and doing west side shuffle.

I'm hearing some
echolocating
on
Lime Kiln
. i heard just one small call as well. im not sure but it almost sounded like a Transient (from above reports, these were Southern Resident orcas - ON).

Transient Orca
Reports throughout the day, from Susan MacKay, Whales and Dolphins of BC, Powell River, BC:
10 am:
a crackling Whale report came in (via radio).

11:20 am:
another report came in which was just as crackling with a location of possibly Whaletown, Cortez Island. Later, the BC Ferry Tacheck, reported seeing Orca just milling about for over an hour from 12 pm between Whaletown and Heriot Bay,
Quadra Island
. Once the tours managed to find these Orca at
3:35 pm by Francisco Point, Cape Mudge area of Quadra Island, they were provided with a spectacular show of breaching, tail slapping and general socializing of between
5 to 6 Transient Orca
. They continued along the Quadra Shore up to Rebecca Spit (the Spit in the initial crackling radio transmission - SM) then back down towards Francisco Point. Aaron, of Campbell River Whale Watching called in the report and said that by the time they left, around 5 pm the tour must have seen around 20 or so breaches from these very active Orca.
*
About

6:30pm
a group of us were at the
Point No Point
lighthouse, where we saw the Victoria Clipper speeding down the sound. Then it halted off Point No Point where we saw a gray whale (we believe this was a
humpback
, reported by others & recently photographed in the area - ON) do several breaches as it headed north.

At

8:00 pm
saw a huge splash way out in the distant shipping lanes right next to a sail boat under sail. (My location: between
Point No Point
and the Hansville Store.) Checked it out with the scope, it was actually much closer to Whidbey Island. It was a
humpback
doing alot of vigorous tail slapping. While I watched the sail boat kept its distance and sailed south. The humpback continued to tail slap and spout for at least 15 minutes. Then it was gone, so I haven't any idea which direction it headed. While I was reporting my humpback sighting this evening to you, he swam across the shipping lanes and is now a little closer to the west side of the inlet. Then he headed out to deeper water, breached a couple of times and headed south around
9:00 pm.

6:22 pm
:
Two Humpback Whales
and possibly a third were spotted again close in front of the Rona store by
Campbell River
. These whales looked similar to the Humpbacks seen over the past while. They are possibly a mother and calf with the third one which would be an escort, usually a larger male protecting his future mate. These Whales were first reported over the radio around

11:30 am
from an unknown source. Two tours were with them later in the day: Tenacious 3 from Discovery Marine Safaris and
Aaron, Campbell River Whale Watching.
