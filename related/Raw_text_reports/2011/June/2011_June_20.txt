Orca Sightings for June 20, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Many
J-Pod Orcas
with K-20 Spock (for a second I thought it was J-26 Mike- with her similar saddle patch & tall dorsal fin! Maybe they have the same dad?!) and her son K-38 Comet formed 2 tight groups traveling north in Haro Strait, seeming to rest a bit, swimming slowly with the flooding tide. At about 3pm, they were off of Henry Island, taking their time heading to Stuart Island, then into Boundary Pass at
4:15pm. Their leisurely pace and breathing enabled us to identify J-22 Oreo with sons J-34 DoubleStuf & J-38 Cookie, J-17- Princess Angeline with granddaughter J-46 Star, J-27 Blackberry with siblings J-31 Tsuchi & J-39 Mako, and J-19 Shachi & her daughter J-41 Eclipse. Also J-28 Polaris, and J-35 Tahlequah with son J-47 Looker, the newest J-Pod calf! Nice to see the families all together.

traveling south around
1 pm

First time sighting in
Clayoquot
- after 20+years that doesn't happen often. We had the
Alaskan (Transient orca) gang (T075s)
visit. They harassed a fur ball (Sea Otter) for a while but didn't kill it. They were oddly friendly in that they approached and circled 2 of the boats. Not totally sure if the bull was in fact T075A as a chunk is missing from the top trailing edge. Can anyone verify (see photo below)? (Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research verified the bull as T075A)

humpback

My husband and I were heading home (
Edmonds
) from Port Townsend at
2pm
on our boat, and saw we a lone
humpback
whale about 3 miles west of the Edmonds ferry terminal. We think he's probably a juvenile (he looked smaller than the ones we had seen in Hawaii). He would glide on the surface 3 or 4 times, then we'd see his fluke and he'd go down for a few minutes. We watched him do this for a few times, then continued on our way home. It was spectacular.

We watched a
minke
whale just off Eagle Cove (near American Camp, south side of
San Juan Island
) feeding, mouth agape on the surface around noon. We, and the neighbors watched, as he/she slowly swam in circles. This is third time one has been sighted off the cove in the last week. Unusual to say the least, even though Salmon Banks is not far away.

We left the whales at
Turn Point

4:30pm
group were at least the
J14s. The J11s, J22s, K13s
all went north earlier in the day.

Hannah Heights
right now- have been going by for about 20 minutes. Not a boat in sight. not all the boys but lot of moms and babies, moving very slowly, no boats.

off SW
Lopez Island
at

and at
4:23 pm we and others heard orca calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones, about 5 pm calls were on OrcaSound hydrophones, heard/reported until at least

5:25 pm
.

We caught up to
J-pod
around Monarch Head on Saturna island. There were about six animals traveling very close to each other, and very close to shore. We even had some passengers capture the elusive 'spyhop' behavior on film. We stayed with the whales as they slowly traveled north in to the
Strait of Georgia
. We watched in silence for a while as we could hear the big male named 'Blackberry' take deep breaths. We would have stayed with the whales longer but they were leading us away from home, so we said our goodbyes and headed back to the harbor just in time to see a beautiful sunset!

Members of
K Pod as well as J Pod
were active all around S
an Juan island
. I was fortunate to be at the right place at the right time for a close pass along the west side of San Juan island. A pair of Orcas glided along the bull kelp near the rocks while other members were off shore spread out. It was a great day to be sitting on the rocks enjoying the beautiful sunshine and whales passing by!

The
Group B Js
headed north along the west side of
San Juan Island
. They were in a casual resting formation relatively close to shore for a while, then lingered near Kellett Bluff before continuing north. Even the little ones in the J17 family group were resting, but I think either J28 or J35 was spy hopping several times. Later, the K13s headed north along the west side of San Juan Island. Although the Ks were initially well behind the Group B Js, I suspect they caught up with the Js near Kellett Bluff. The Group A Js were bringing up the rear several hours later. J2 Granny was in the lead, well ahead of the others in this group. The rest trickled by, more or less in their family units. I cannot say whether or not L87 was with them.

Nice show (
Orcas
) off of Village Point on
Lummi Island
this morning about

7:10 ~
7:40 am
.

7 a.m:
had to be late to work to watch
orcas
passing on west side
Lummi Island
south to
Rosario Strait
- very spread out and far out in the channel - quiet enough to hear their blows. A neighbor passed in her car and said they'd seen them from the Willows Inn at about the same time the morning before! sounds like it could be the regular June loop that we've seen many times over the years here.
Penny Stone, Lummi Island, WA

1:45pm
: Sunshine, blue skies and
orcas
- can't get much better that this. Orcas are cruising slowly past Flint Beach, south end of
Lopez
, going usual route of east to west. One large male close to shore, another male slightly further out. A couple of breaches. Tight group of 5 or 6 including juvenile out further.
Sally Reeve, Lopez Island, WA
