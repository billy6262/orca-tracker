Orca Sightings for October 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had several
orcas
on both sides of the boat on the MV Coho

3:00 PM
sailing from
Victoria to Port Angeles
, just over halfway across. I have no idea who they were, but way out in mid-strait I assume they were transients. It looked to me like females with calves, I'd estimate 6-10 in all. I saw one brief spy hop. There were lots of people on the boat, so I'm sure there are photos out there somewhere.

We were surprised to see
2-3 white sided dolphins
lunging and feeding in the strong ebbing currents at Bowman Bay,
Deception Pass
near
5pm
. At the same time a pod of Dalls porpoises were feeding alongside them, porpoising the same as the dolphins....

What a peak experience as these two different species surrounded us in our kayak with their explosive exhales :)

We had a report of "a large group" of
orcas
out west towards Victoria, BC but heading into the area. They were just at the outer range of the Explorer, but we hoped the flood tide would push them in further. Which made viewing the 30 or so Stellar Sea Lions on and around Whale Rocks much easier. Soon we were headed out west towards Victoria, BC when we had a report of 2 Pacific White-Sided Dolphins! WOW! We found them playing and leaping out of a boat wake. We finally found them foraging and going every direction around the
Constance Bank
area south of downtown Victoria, BC. We dropped our hydrophone in and we got to listen in as
J Pod was vocalizing like crazy
. J8 Speiden and J30 Riptide were our first two whales to ID. We also saw J34 Doublestuff as he was chasing after two juveniles as if to play with them. These two little guys put on quite the surface active behaviors, everything from tail lobs to backward swimming to spyhops and even a few breaches! The calmness at the surface was broken by loud blows when the whales would come up to exhale. Then down they'd go and we'd listen to them underwater. Before we knew it, it was time to head back to Friday Harbor. We searched on the way home for the two humpbacks that had been reported at Constance Bank as well as the two humpbacks also reported at Hannah Heights, but couldn't locate either group. Dozens of porpoises were zipping about in the currents at Middle Bank.
