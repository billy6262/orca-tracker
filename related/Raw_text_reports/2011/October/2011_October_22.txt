Orca Sightings for October 22, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We are seeing as many as
8-10 Humpback Whales
, most days in the waters off Victoria. Generally seen in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
south of Albert Head and south and west of Race Rocks Ecological Reserve. Some even much further west off Sooke, Vancouver Island. Some I know have ventured toward San Juan Island and up Haro Strait in the past month. Almost all of the animals seen this year, have been sighted in previous years but this cropped pic attached showing the ventral side of the fluke could be of a new comer. I can't say I have seen it around here before. It was seen Sunday 22nd of October off Church Rock in Metchosin. They are such interesting marine mammals to watch. October is definitely Humpback Whale month around here, as they forage for small schooling fish, before heading across the Pacific to Hawaii, or maybe south along the coast to Mexico. Mostly seen in pairs lately, and today was no exception. Split fin and split fluke were out there as well as one we call ' Heather ' who has a distinct ' H ' etched in the left under-side of her fluke. Always an amazing encounter.

My husband and I spotted
a lone Orca on the Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry run on Oct 22 at
4:10
about halfway between PT and Keystone/Coupeville. It appeared to be feeding since it came out of the water about halfway a couple of times and was rolling about in the same area for a few minutes. There were quite a few sea birds around the area where the water was disturbed so we assume it was hunting/feeding. We have seen minkes and Dall's porpoises on this run before, and this definitely was an orca with the distinct black and white markings and correct size. The water was very calm yesterday afternoon so anything that popped up was easy to observe. Also, on Wednesday this week when the water was very calm on the same ferry route, I spotted 3 sea lions feeding about mid-channel in 3 different areas.
