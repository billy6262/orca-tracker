4:38 pm
-
Orcas
are northbound past
Kellett Bluff
. They have been trickling past, a few at a time, for a while now. Most are pretty far from shore. A few are stopping to forage. The first ones to pass were pretty quiet (or too far from shore for their calls to be detected), but others have been more vocal and audible on the nearby OrcaSound hydrophone.
