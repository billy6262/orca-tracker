Orca Sightings for October 21, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Location:
west of Trial Island
, eastbound in
Strait of Juan de Fuca, Time:
1:21 to
2:17
, boat: The Peregrine, Maya's Westside Charters. We encountered all
J Pod, K Pod and all members of L Pod except, I saw no members of the L12s
. The pods were traveling in mixed groupings. At least 10 whales surfaced right at the boat. Among them were Ballena L90 and her mom Baba L26 They were in the middle of this large group. Other whales I could see in this group were at least J22, J32, J34, J38, L78, L2, L72, L105. I got several pictures of Ballena L-90. There did not seem to be any labored breathing and there was no lagging behind. She was with her mom in every picture I got during different times of our encounter with the whales. Crewser L-92 was with another group, farther away, during Ballena's close pass. For pictures and more about the encounter see: Whale of a Purpose.

Hydrophone reports

10:29 pm
- Faint calls and whistles at
Lime Kiln
. I can hear
L pod
for sure, but the orcas are too far from the hydrophone to hear distinct calls. Sounds like they're talking a lot, though.
