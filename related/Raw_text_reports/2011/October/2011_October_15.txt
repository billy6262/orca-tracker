Orca Sightings for October 15, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had a shoreline sighting of
T18's
Sat. We found them on the webcam and forwarded the info to Ron Bates, caught up with the pack off of
Clover Point (Victoria) around 2 pm
. Maria Chantelle Tucker

I was out on the water and a group of
11 transients
were found out west of Sooke and
4 transients
who turned out to be the
T18s were off Victoria water front
. When we arrived west of Sooke the transients could not be identified. Later that night with the help of Ron Bates the transients were ID'd as transients from California. Final Identification on the California transient killer whales: The male was
CA 166
and the main female with the black spot on the saddle patch is
CA 172
. They have only been seen in BC waters a couple of times and also only seen in California waters a couple of times. Final IDs: Josh McInnes, Ron Bates and Alisa Schulman

No news for the last couple of days regarding the Southern Resident Orcas but we had
2 groups of Transient Orcas off Victoria
. In the morning
7 Transients were spotted south of Race Rocks
heading west. In the afternoon
4 Transients were first spotted on one of the local web cameras
near Cook St and when boats arrived scene they id the T's as the
T18's
. We also had one report of
a Humpback Whale at the top end of Haro Strait
! The day before there were at least
8 Humpback Whales sighted off Victoria
and one off
San Juan Island
