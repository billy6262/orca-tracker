Orca Sightings for October 16, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod with the K7s and L87
came south through
Trincomali Channel
today at approximately

13:00
. They were in a very relaxed and social mood, displaying a range of behavior from spyhopping (three at once!), breaching, porpoising, logging, sharking, cartwheeling, "blowing raspberries", and even some mating/sexual play going on. At one point, the
J4s, J7s, most of the J9s, and K7s
came together in what I can only call an "orca soup" or orca dog pile, as they stopped swimming and simply rolled over each other, all the while vocalizing which could be heard above the water. Speaking of which, the hydrophones revealed VERY chatty whales! LOTS of amazing and near constant vocalizing. Incredible day, I will never forget it.
