I live on
Richmond Beach
and there were at least
3 orcas out in front of my house yesterday at noon to 1pm headed north
. Playing and spouting their blow holes. It was fantastic!!!!

12:30-
13:30
(slack low tide) - Orcas 1/2 mi off of PT Wells Thursday. I looked back and read that there were
Orcas
right off of where I live, Richmond Beach, at this very time last year. I grabbed an awesome 14' Ohana racing Stand Up Paddle board from Urban Surf, and headed out. I paddled North from
Richmond Beach
Saltwater Park, into a 10 knot warm North wind. As I paddled, hugging the shoreline
along Appletree Lane, a lady, from her beachfront house's upper deck, yelled to me, "there are whales right there."
They were "right there." 3-4 individuals at 47.7820413 -122.3973544. One big orca would do pivoting turns and powered gradual dives with its dorsal fin canted 45 degrees to its right side. Big whale was the most active of the group. The 1-2 small, and 1-2 medium orcas I saw only "porpoise" a few times. I don't know what the group was doing. They seemed to be feeding tho, as they
stayed in the same square mile block for an hour
. They were slowly moving towards the South and West, if at all. The big whale did have an impressively large dorsal fin. I could not see markings or scars. I have seen orcas at Richmond Beach twice before, always at this time of year. Once was while kiteboarding- that was a surprise! Thanks, keep up the good work. I read each sightings report!

12:55 -
gotta leave them.
They are steadily heading south
. Lead group is about with
Port Madison or beyond
, tail enders not far behind,
just south of Kingston
. Lots of orca, at least 40 but so hard to gage from my distance. More tails slaps and breaching. Happy me, happy orca. Some pleasure boat has been with them the whole time, behaving respectfully of guidelines and in general looks like.

12:21pm
- So amazing, they are in huge resting lines moving southward. Lots of tail slaps and breaches by a few lively ones. Still really far away from me but powerful. West of mid channel near the point
just north of Kingston
.

11:50am - So beautiful to see a dozen blows and breaches simultaneously
even from miles away. They have turned to a southerly direction,
towards Eglon
.

11:40 - SRKW's big group
has stalled/met up
between Eglon and Pt No Pt.
Lunge feeding, breaching for at least the last 30 minutes. Hugging kitsap side.

11:03 - they are so spread out and still coming
. Can see some
south Edmonds to Kingston to Posession pt
, and spread across channell. Some breaches between Apple cove and Eglon. Foraging thruout, with progressive northward movement.

10:35am - mid channel. Between Edmonds ferry and Eglon.
I have seen 3 big males and at least 6 females, spread out heading steadily north.

11:45 -

12:30 - Double Bluff, Whidbey
- black shapes in the distance heading north, bit difficult to see with glare and haze.

12:30 they'd turned south
and I lost sight of them.

10:28 am
- There are at least
3 Orcas off the Edmonds Marina
! Can't really tell which way they are heading. They seem to just be hanging around...

When?

07:45-
09:20
Where? I was at
Golden Gardens Park
in Seattle with binoculars. I could see them on the other side of the sound, swimming north along the
north end of Bainbridge Island
, from Murden Cove, through Rolling Bay, Port Madison Bay, and
up towards Kingston & Edmonds
. Some smaller orcas would loop back and veer off to the sides of the main group. At least 2 males. One really big one.
