Orca Sightings for April 1, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We got word of
Transient orcas
at the south end of
Saltspring Island
The group first appeared to be heading southeast, but what followed was only the first of many direction changes that we witnessed during our encounter. The travel pattern would have been best described as a series of large circles. At least one, if not several, seals lost out to these top ocean predators. We could see oil slicks on the water, and the gulls plus one bald eagle joined in for scraps. Following the meal there was some play time, and we were fortunate to see some spyhops, tail stands and even hear some of those eerily, amazing transient vocals. The whales that I could ID in the group were
T100, T100B, T100C,T100E, T90, T90B
and possibly newish
calf
with T90,
T124, T124D and T124E
. T100B appeared to be calf-sitting T100E for mom, while T100 worked on getting lunch. T90 appears to have a tag, very visible on her left side dorsal fin, and showing as a dark bump on her right side dorsal

Salt Spring Island, BC!
The
T100s and T124s
, travel east, the right direction for us. Later on in the day, in US waters just north of Patos Island, they attacked a Steller Sea Lion.
