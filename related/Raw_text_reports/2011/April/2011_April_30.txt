Orca Sightings for April 30, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Finally found some
Transients
. They seemed to disappear for a few days but we found a group of about
15
including
T37's, T65A and calves and T137A
. They were in the middle of the Strait of Georgia and were heading for the coal docks.

We got to see wonderful
Transient Orcas
this
afternoon
, north of Pt. Roberts, almost to Vancouver, BC. We didn't know they were out there until right before we left the dock at Snug Harbor Marina. It's a very long trip, but we had sunny skies, calm winds and a full boat.

I was at
Lime Kiln Park (San Juan Island)
with my friend Melissa around

2:45 PM
. After watching the movement in the water it appeared to be a
Minke whale
.

A few blows and a back of what appeared to be a
Humpback Whale
slowly moving in a Northerly / North-West direction in mid strait between Sliammon (just north of
Powell River
) and Harwood. I watched between
10 and
10:30 am
then spotted it again, a short distance North, close to Atrevida Reef around 11 am still continuing towards Lund / Savary.

Probable
Minke whale
spotted from
Lime Kiln
-- we watched it from
2-3 pm
. It was dark colored and we saw its small dorsal fin as it surfaced several times. Also saw a very large (possibly pregnant?) harbor seal hauled out on a rock, sunning herself. It was a good day for sun!

At

3:00 pm
, on Maya's Westside Charters, we met up with several
transient orcas
north of the
Coal Docks BC
, heading northwest. Shortly into the encounter they slowed down, split and each group attacked prey. The group we watched attacked a harbor seal. Both groups seemed to move off at the same time, continuing to move northwest at a good speed. I identified
T75B, T75B1, T75C, T36As, T65As and the T137s
. I'll post pics on my blog.

We were blessed with
Transients
(I think the T137's, T65A's, and T37's if I remember correctly...) in the
Strait of Georgia
heading toward the coal docks near Vancouver at approx.

13:00
. They were moving quickly north (with a couple occasional abrupt, milling halts) and were in two fairly tight groups when we saw them.

So, we finish the month as we started, with
transient orcas
cruising the waters usually patrolled by the residents. Today, a group of 10-12 transients was located in
Georgia Strait
at approximately

12:30
, about 3 nm north of Tumbo Island. They were traveling northwest, at a fairly fast rate of speed, sometimes porpoising. The group consisted of females, juveniles, calves and 1 sprouting male. We were able to identify some of them as the
T65A
group and the
T137's, T137A
being the sprouter. The orcas were traveling in two groups, with T137A and some juveniles lagging about 200 m/yards behind the moms, and engaging in a fair amount of social activity. At one point, the group stopped and was milling in one area for about 5 minutes, then continued on their speedy way. I've included a photo of a juvenile porpoising its way up the Strait (see photo above) - photo taken with zoom lens and cropped. We left the whales still heading north to northwest, west of the Tsawassen feryy terminal.

11:40 am:
Just spotted what appeared to be two female
orcas
just east of tanker parked in the (Elliott) bay. I think there's a group just heading out of the bay, but I'm not 100% sure. They seem to be split into a group of 2 and one of 3, they appear to be heading towards Magnolia from what I can tell.

right now!!! At least
5 orcas
, one big and one small, not traveling, just milling, SW of the ferry dock in Elliott Bay, Seattle.

We heard tale of
transients
past East Point headed toward the
coal docks
. The whales were still headed NW at a steady clip of 7-10 knots. Finally another boat came into view. Then we saw huge splashes. Finally we caught up to the pod, almost. They were cruising at about 10 knots. At first we could see what looked to be
5 or 6 dorsal fins
. Then, after a few good surfacings, the rest of the pod came into view. There were at least 10 whales swimming side by side and another 2 or 3 about 700 yards west of the main pod. We watched for about 20 minutes as the pods split and then fused again and again. There were at least two juveniles in the pod (one may have been more of a calf size). The whales altered their course very little in the time we saw them. They were cruising at the surface, taking big breaths. We shut down the engines so we could listen to the exhalations. It was so calm and there was so little wind that we could hear them even from more than a couple hundred yards away.

We had
two Orcas
off
Depoe Bay, OR
today. No doubt there were more but only one very large male and another with a medium dorsal were spotted. I believe this is the third time in the last month we have seen them.
