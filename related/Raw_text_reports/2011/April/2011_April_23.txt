Entry 3:
We saw
T123A
again traveling with
T137A
along the

shoreline. They were very active with breaches, tail slaps and the classic belly to belly activity. There were a few other T's in the area too.

My son who lives in
Tacoma
saw [
orcas
] from the shore south of the Narrows Bridge about
4 PM
). He said some people thought it was 2 adults and one baby. He thought they all looked big.

And a N. Puget Sound Gray whale update from Cascadia Research: It appears to me we have had Gray whales
#21, 44, 49, 53, 56, 383, 531, and 723
(so far in the 2011 season). The two regulars I do not think we have seen but cannot quite confirm if they might have been seen by someone else are 22 and 356.
John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research, Olympia, WA

We live on San Juan Island west coast between the two
hydrophones
, and HEARD a LOT of [
orcas
] passing by beginning at

9:45pm
. They seemed to be going north. Once they had passed (and we got cold) I tuned to the hydrophones but heard nothing, so the report of hearing them at 11 pm suggests they turned around and came south again.
Mimi Anderson, San Juan Island, WA
*
I thought I would send you this photo of
J28
"Polaris" and her calf
J46
a couple miles East of
Sheringham Point
in the
morning
. Apart from J28 & J 46, we also were able to identify the "Cookie Crew".

We had been up on
San Juan Island
and were welcomed back to the Anacortes ferry landing by a small group of
harbor porpoise
as the
5:40PM ferry was coming to dock.

On Maya's Westside Charters in the later
afternoon
, we encountered members of
J pod,
just east of
Race Passage
, as they traveled eastbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Whales were spread miles out from shore. Whales we saw were
J16, J26, J42, J28, J46, J17, J44, J34, J22, J14, J30, J37, J40 and J45
. More of the encounter on my blog.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island, WA

Ron Bates and Mark Malleson relayed information on a sighting of
J pod
around
Sooke
Inlet heading east.
L87
was seen to still be with them! They are fighting against a strong ebb so are traveling slowly.
From Kelsey on Beam Reach catamaran; the Gato Verde

1430: J pod
with
L87
near Sooke (
S. Vancouver Island
), BC heading east.
Ron Bates, MMRG, Victoria, B.C.

Afternoon
, we saw
Orca
just off the mouth of Mayo Cove heading down (Southeast) Carr Inlet toward McNeil Island (
S. Puget Sound
). There were three adults and I believe there were two calves. We live on the point between Mayo and Van Geldern coves and the Orca were 4-500 yards off shore. They were moving slowly and frequently surfacing until a Sheriff boat came roaring down Carr Inlet from the direction of Purdy, which caused the whales to dive. The Sheriff boat did a U turn about where the Orca dove then backed off to the North and came down off a plane. I believe the Sheriff boat deliberately "harassed" the Orca and definitely violated the exclusionary zone around the pod (as exhibited by the way the boat turned almost exactly where the whales last surfaced). Several minutes after the Sheriff boat cleared the area, the Orca surfaced on the far side of Penrose point, and continued on toward McNeil Island.

Reports of
Orca
Southbound in Lewis Channel just below Teakerne Arm (
N. of Powell River, BC
) around
11am
. They slowly moved down the channel to just above the Copeland Islands, locally known as the Ragged Islands. The weather was almost summer-like, and flat calm water to boot! The Campbell River Whale Watching tour caught up with them around

12:30 pm
between Kinghorn and Mink Islands in Desolation Sound. There were
10 or more animals
in the group which were probably the
Transients
that had been working their way down Johnstone Strait
April 21st. Later in the afternoon, the whales headed Northward up Waddington Channel and were last seen around Church House on Stuart Island just below the Yuculta Rapids.

A group of
transient orcas
was located at around
noon
in
Georgia Strait
, in the middle, west of Deltaport. The group consisted of the
T36A's, T123's, and T137's
. Initially, they were doing the typical transient travel - 5 minutes underwater, followed by about 5 breaths, and repeat. As the group traveled northwest, they came upon a California sea lion. The attack was immediate, with the females and even the juveniles getting in on the act. While the moms were doing all the work, T123A breached 3 times some distance away from the sea lion, then proceeded to perform tail waves. As it turned out, his anticipation of a warm lunch was not to be, as the sneaky sea lion managed to get away. The whales passed by the area where the sea lion had last been, but after a short time, they turned away and continued to the northwest. T123A and T137A were very chummy, swimming seperately from the mom & kids group, and doing alot of rolling around together.

Carolyn Mercer called at

7:08 pm
to report a
Gray whale
about 1 mile out off North Bluff Rd, N. of
Greenbank
- it had been there a half hour or so.
*
~
5:30 pm
: This
gray whale
just swam north past our house on the
Langley
side of
Saratoga Passage
, just south of Bells Beach. It was staying close to the bluffs and surfacing every minute or so.
Harry West, Langley, Whidbey Island, WA

We got a little side-tracked by the sighting of a
Gray whale
. It caught our attention about

12:45
just north of
Langley
. A couple on the beach saw it breach and therefore had the honor of ringing the bell. We hurried up the beach towards the sandy point and watched as it continued to spout, the whale swimming in the same general vicinity. As we neared the little sandy point he had moved east past us towards downtown Langley. He crossed over towards
Camano
and moved around out there about the time the parade made it's way down to the waterfront. Once the welcoming ceremony was over and folks dispersed, we spotted it again NW of Langley heading east. The whale continued heading east towards and nearing Camano head. About

3:15
was the last time we saw it surface. A most beautiful and perfect Welcome the Whales day.

11:35 AM:
Neighbor, Sue Kuebler called to alert me that their was a whale, headed from Murden cove to Seattle. Fast pace, very elusive, taking breathes every 5 minutes or more. Doesn't seem to be feeding, moving too fast. Nadine Benson calls to say the
gray whale
is back. Very close to, seems to be feeding, but still moves rather quickly. Tail (?) seems to have a distinguishing nick out of it. Still moving quickly. Again along the beach to Yeomolt, heading to Seattle.

We live on the bluff on
Fox Spit
and were blessed by that wonderful swoosh sound this morning about

10:00am
as we were tending to our garden. We looked over the bluff and saw one Gray coming South towards Eastpoint. All at once 3 more surfaced! They were obviously feeding (rolling and circling) and stayed around for about 2 hours. I got a few pictures of the largest one as it passed by our house and will send them to you in a following email. He looked to be 35-40 feet long. Much larger than the other 3 which parted from the large guy and headed back North. As he headed towards East Point he traveled about 60 feet from the shoreline.

One beautiful
Gray
feeding by sunset, just below the bluff~
Baby Islan
d Heights about 50' offshore. It is a very dark whale, not a lot of barnacles - breathing, feeding, and enlivening the world! On her/his way south to Fox Spit now @

8:15 pm.
