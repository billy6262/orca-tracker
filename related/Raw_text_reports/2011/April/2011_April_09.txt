Orca Sightings for April 9, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network and the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network received a call late Saturday afternoon with a report of a
dead Gray whale
found on a remote
Whidbey Island Beach
. The whale was very emaciated, and not one of our North Puget Sound population of 10 - 12 Grays that stay in the area for several months each spring to feed on the ghost shrimp beds of Saratoga Passage and Possession Sound. Howard Garrett and Matt Klope of the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network responded on Sunday, and a necropsy was performed Tuesday by a team from Cascadia Research and CPSMMSN. No food was found in the whale's stomach or intestines, samples were taken and will be submitted for further testing to try to determine cause of death, but it is likely this is just one of the whales that didn't get enough food last season and was not strong enough to make the long migration down south and back north.

SINGLE
GRAY
DRIVE BY at
Mariners Cove [N.E. Whidbey]
at about

6:30PM
. REALLY CLOSE TO SHORE. Where, [most/all] of its head and much of its body surfaced out of the water, as it passed by. Sure, makes a difference when you see them, in ultra calm waters. And, when gray is so close to the beach and shoreline [50 to 75] feet out or so. Evidently, gray did not have much appetite for sand/ghost shrimp. After two brief beneaths the water surface/swirling stops, it went out to deeper water. Just south of the pilings to the Cove marina entrance. Last spouts seen, as gray headed N.E. towards Strawberry Point.
