Orca Sightings for April 22, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pretty sure I saw an orca (black and white) and smaller than a whale, but it might have been a small
humpback
. Whatever it was, it was pretty exciting.

We had a juvenile
humpback
breach repeatedly at
Point No Point (N Kitsap Peninsula, WA
) around

3:20-
3:30 pm
, also lots of pec slapping. The whale was first sighted heading northwest and then turned around and headed southeast into Puget Sound.

Saw maybe
3 killer whales
today towards the end of our trip at about

1:45pm
at 36.46.5 & 121.53.2. One of them was tail slapping and then breached in front of the boat! We didn't stay with them too long as they began to mill about heading west. I matched the ID I took with a photo from 6/25/10. I believe this is a sprouting male who associates with the CA122s.

2 or more Transient Orca
spotted right out in front of the
Powell River
Ferry terminal at

8:20 am
. I picked them up continuing on a slow roll towards Grief Point. Since they were close to shore, I couldn't get a definitive count on them, but one large male and one, possibly two females. Transient Orcas this morning at

8:20am
by
Powell River
, only two were visible at any time with the big male being either
T054 or T093
. They did cruise by some sea lions, and were on a head on course for the porpoises reported by Myrtle Rocks. Two Orca reported just south of Powell River at

10:40am
. Some resting and continuing slowly southward.
