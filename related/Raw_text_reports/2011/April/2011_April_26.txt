Orca Sightings for April 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Breaching
Gray whales
near Everett.
Island Adventures, Anacortes
*
We saw
3 or 4 orcas
, quite active,in the mouth of
Friday Harbor
just below the pt. to the east of of the marine lab on Monday as we came in on the ferry at about

3:30
. A friend coming in on the ferry from Lopez saw them again in the same place on Tuesday afternoon.

We spotted
two large Orcas
( at least - may have been four) at about
4.30pm
off Plettenburg Bay, Western Cape (
South Africa
). They were fairly close to shore swimming from Lookout Beach and round across Robberg. I think they were disturbed by motor boat and kyak at got close to them. They then moved out to sea. Just prior to spotting them there was a huge school of smaller dolphin moving in the same direction. I would love to know if a sighting in this area is unusual and if this pod was migratory.

Just as we were admiring the wildlife of Spieden Island we heard talk of
orca
whales just outside of
Friday Harbor
. We said adios to the deer and took off in hot pursuit of the rumored whales. Just north of the harbor entrance we saw blows in the distance. We could count three separate dorsal fins at the surface at the same time. We cruised slowly alongside and slightly behind the pod of transients for about fifteen minutes. They stayed fairly close to shore and kept a distance of several hundred yards, but even from a distance we could see that there was a calf present.

On Maya's Westside Charters at about

4:00pm
we received a call of three
transient
orca spotted near
Pt. Caution
, coming up
San Juan Channel
. The three whales present were:
T75B, T75B1 and T75C
. These are the same whales who were at Anderson Island on the 24th. Later, from shore, I watched as they continued up San Juan Island, entering Spieden Channel, traveling west in mid-channel. I last saw them at
7:05pm angling toward Henry Island. T75B and T75C were seen on 4-15 swimming backward. Today they were swimming backward again, as witnessed by me from shore and Ivan and Chris on the Western Explorer.

Transients
April 23 - 26 - Some IDs for the Puget Sound Transients: Thanks to some great ID photos sent to us by several of the folks lucky enough to see the pod of
Transient orcas
that has been hanging around
Puget Sound
the past weeks, we finally have IDs of several of the whales:
T75B and T75C
are there.

Nice morning over here on the
Marrowstone side of Admiralty Inlet
. Finally saw a
Gray Whale
. Just after
7 a.m.
this morning as I was walking south from East Beach. The whale was feeding immediately off the cemetary, then moved south along where there is a nice long sand bar and eelgrass flats that forms north of Nodule Point.
