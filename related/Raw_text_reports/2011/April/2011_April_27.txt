Entry 1:
Three
Orca whales
seen in
Harney Channel
(one large and two smaller dorsal), definately saw the white spots. First seen on Shaw side and cross to the entrance of Grindstone Harbor heading west. Spent a lot of time off Sweeney Cove. We first saw them around

T75B, T75B1 and T75C
heading west isns in this same general area.

I had
three transient orca
inside Deer Harbor this afternoon. Pretty rare to see orca so close to the marina but with transients, one never knows. I heard from Ivan on Western Prince they are the T-75's. They have been around the Wasp Islands part of
yesterday and all day today
.

At
6 PM
there was a
Gray Whale
headed from
NW Langley
out toward Camano Head. The whale came from the north and seemed to be headed in a southerly direction.

We watched a
Gray Whale
for over an hour as it fed immediately off East Beach County Park (
Marrowstone Island
). The tide was low enough so that we could walk out to the edge of the sand flat and take some photos and feel about as close to the whale as you can get without swimming.
Ron and Brenda Hirschi, Marrowstone Island
