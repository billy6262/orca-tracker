Orca Sightings for April 5, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research tagged along aboard the Western Prince after Captain Ivan saw some whales from the ferry just outside of
Friday Harbor
in the early evening. We found the whales with the help of Jeannie Hyde around
1845
just NW of
Yellow Island
(approximately 48 36.73N 123 03.44W). The whales were the
T49As and T49Bs
, six whales in all. They moved northwest slowly in a tight group, barely showing any saddle. Present were
T49A, T49A1, T49B, T49B1
, and the two newish calves
T49A3 and T49B2
. T49A2 was not there and it is unclear as to whether this juvenile dispersed or died. We ended the encounter and left them still slowly heading NW, mid San Juan Channel, between Jones Island and Limestone Pt., SJI at
1925
.

): From

5:30 p.m. to
6:00 p.m
., we watched
some orcas
traveling and circling in front of our cabin. Steve saw a large male way out from the others. The most I saw at one time was
four

I saw about
6 Dalls Porpoise
on
April 5 around Church House and the entrance to
Bute Inlet (Johnstone Bluff)
around
12pm
. Then on my way out around
1345
I saw about
6 Pacific White Sided Dolphins
! They were just behind Clipper Pt. Then the really exciting news, I saw
3 fins
today in Hole In The Wall around 10 this morning. My second
Orca
encounter for the year! They were headed west with the tide (max ebb at 941 -7.2kts) 1 smaller fin and 2 larger ones, hard to say if they were males or large females. Didn't get photo's either.
