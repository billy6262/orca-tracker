Around

4:30 pm
I spotted a blow close to the Texada Island side of Harwood Island. I saw another blow by the reef off of Blubber Bay, where the Texada ferry docks. Then, over a period of time, another 5 or 6 blows by one animal. No sighting of back or tail flukes, and looking at the size and shape of the blow, I
lean towards it being a Gray Whale
rather than a Humpback.

minke whale
spotted from the Gato Verde near Marrowstone Island in Admiralty Inlet this
morning
! He breached at least five times that we saw. Definite minke: no big pectorals and small body size.

A magical 4th Annual
Quileute
Tribal School Whale Welcoming Ceremony today at
La Push
. The sun broke through at the river mouth as the children danced, the drummers drummed, and songs were sung to honor and welcome the "brothers of the sea". The tide was out, the bay was flat calm...no sign of whales. The Whale Callers, in stunning regalia, assembled at the water's edge. Two boys entered the water and bare-chested pulled the little raft with cedar boughs and a fresh salmon out past all the little breakers, a food offering for the whales. The boys swam back to shore. No whales. The ancient whale calling ceremony concluded, and participants came up from the beach to rejoin the crowd. Many eyes still hopefully scanned the horizon one more time. And then they were spotted:
a parade of orcas moving north
outside the bay. Some people saw five or six at a time, some thought they saw twice that number. An elder was heard to say "I guess the Whale Callers did their job!"

My neighbor called me last
night
and told me she saw an
orca
pod out in Henderson Bay off Carr Inlet in
Gig Harbor
/ Purdy area (
S. Puget Sound
, WA). I saw 3 Orcas and my neighbor said she saw 3 adults and at least 2 babies. They stayed in the same area for numerous hours - splashing and seemingly having a great time.

We saw our first [
orcas
] just north of Sand Heads in the
Strait of Georgia
. 4 whales, I was able to ID
T123 and T123A
who is sprouting now and his dorsal fin is getting huge! We left that group and started heading home when we saw splashing in the the distance and as we got closer we could see breaching, tail slaps, spy hops so we were convinced it was residents but as we approached, we realized after seeing
T87
that it was a large, active group of
T's
! (between
12-15
). T87 seemed to have the top of his dorsal fin either missing or flopped over.

Marie at Orca Live from the upper
Johnstone Strait
area had one report of
Transients
today: Wow more transient excitement this morning! The
T023's
came back heading North in
Blackney
. They attacked a sealion about 100m off the lab and were very vocal throughout!!! They have now left view still headed North. They did not kill the sea lion and he seems ok as I am watching him now about 30 m off the lab. There have still been a few intermittent calls.

About
7 Orcas
actively feeding off southwest end of
McNeil Island, So. Puget Sound
for 10 minutes starting @
0815
(est. 47 deg 12 min 00 sec X 122 deg 43min 40 sec). Maybe one male and at least three young. Seen from Mahncke Point. Departing direction unknown. Two of our four resident eagles and about 10 seagulls went out to clean up the scraps.

Just 7 miles out of
Moss Landing CA
, we came across a huge gathering of
killer whales
hunting a sea lion. They were porpoising out of the water throwing the sea lion around, and some came over and spy-hopped by the boat. There seemed to be around 3 different pods in the area, maybe
15+ killer whales
spread out over about 1/2 mile.

At
11 am
students on board the Beam Reach Science and Sustainability School vessel the GatoVerde called to report what they believed to be a
Minke whale
in
Admiralty Inlet
, off Marrowstone Island. They saw it breach 4 times! They also reported a Harbor porpoise in Skunk Bay, Kitsap Peninsula at around
12:45 pm.
*
Walked north from East Beach on Marrowstone in
Admiralty Inlet
and Brenda first saw the blow of what appears to be a
Humpback
at about

8:15 am
. It was first about 1/4 of way out from Marrowstone side, heading north, quickly. Blew four times as it moved further out into mid channel. Last seen about
8:45 nearing
Keystone
, directly off Marrowstone Point.

In one of today's Gray whale reports (see below), the observer mentions a
possible Humpback
in
Saratoga Passage
, and in a Facebook post by Island Adventures they mention a Humpback whale being sighted off Everett, WA on
April 18th.

Saw
Gray whales
from our office again today! At

5:05 pm
I saw a spout in
Saratoga Passage
, off the south end of Elger Bay, Camano Island, very close to shore, likely feeding.

Three gray whales
sighted in
Saratoga Passage
between
1pm and
3:30pm
. Two were grays, one may have been a humpback although too far away to tell for sure. All three traveling separately: one from the open Passage toward Holmes Harbor, one crossing the Passage toward Camano Island, one traveling from west to east close to Whidbey along the face of Baby Island Heights. The most exciting moment came when one of them breached near Camano Island State Park at around

3:20pm
. It appeared fairly close-in near the boat launch (as seen from Baby Island Heights).

Ally from the Beam Reach Boat called to relay a report from the Adventuress Schooner of
a Gray whale
off
Jetty Island
at

12:30 pm
. Beam Reach was also with a Gray whale half way between Langley, Whidbey Island, and Elger Bay, Camano Island during the afternoon
*
We just (
~
6:30 pm
) saw the
sea lion
gang at the west end of Penn Cove, heading slowly east. They were diving and surfacing together.
