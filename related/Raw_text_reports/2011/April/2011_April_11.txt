Orca Sightings for April 11, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
After the report of
5 to 6 Orca
coming in my direction yesterday around

12:30 pm
, I quickly got a few things organized and headed out to find them with a neighbour. We spotted them rounding Grief Point and were surprised to see so many blows. There were around 16 of them spread out from
Texada Island
to the mainland. With them being so spread out, it was quite difficult to figure out who they were other than
Transient Orca
. Dropped the hydrophone in and not a peep. At least at the start. Later on they became quite vocal - a typical Transient Orca trait. Paced one group, at a safe distance - all boats are required to keep their distance - close to
Harwood Island
in front of Powell River. The other group with one or two males continued up towards Atrevida Reef area. The group we were with had two calves, one of which was having a great time porpoising clear out of the water. They continued to breach, roll around, tail lob and spy hop. Lots of missed photos - if only they'd be more co-operative. Having stopped the skiff and drifting, it was wonderful that they came over to investigate even surprising us by surfacing right beside the boat. Although we didn't see them actually take any porpoises or sea lions, one photo looks like there is something in one whale's mouth.

Chrissy McLean of the PTMSC called at

10:30 am
with a 2nd hand report that
a pod of orcas
were seen going north past
Marrowstone in Admiralty Inlet
.

10:43 am:
just got another good look at them. They are south of the ferry lanes, looks like they are milling in mid channel bank with the fishing boats and birds. At least one large male in the small group.

10:53 am:
starting to hear
vocalizations
- still in the same spot. sounds like
Transients
.
