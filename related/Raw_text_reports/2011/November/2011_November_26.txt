Orca Sightings for November 26, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched
4 transients
today about a mile and a half outside
Moss Landing Harbor
. They hunted and killed a sea lion and put on quite a show: porpoising, breaching, and flinging the sea lion out of the water. After the hunt, they slowly made their way west for about 6 or 7 miles, then doubled back towards Moss Landing before we left. While traveling they were diving between 5-7 minutes. We identified them as CA 138s (3 members) and CA217 (Chopfin). The last few times we saw the CA138s they were with a different male (CA171b).

Pod of about
6 orcas in monterey bay
feeding on a california sea lion then heading back out to sea. There was one large male with a cut-off fin - looked like a propeller. Photos (may be useful for ID) HERE. These are also amazing photos.

We saw a pod of orcas this afternoon (around
3 pm
) coming from the north and swimming through
Dodds Narrows
to the south (in the Canadian Gulf Islands just south of Nanaimo). A number of them were slapping their tails. Some where upside down while doing this. Is this fairly common? One breached on its side.
