Entry 1:
Watching them from
Pt. No Point
right now :) they were headed south. There were about 10 of them and at their closest point were about 100 yards off shore. We saw a few spy hops!

4:30 pm
- Just spotted them out from
Skunk Bay
thanks to a neighbor's heads up. In the middle of the channel, drifting slowly to
Point No Point
. I see them just off the lighthouse now and not all that far out. They are headed southeast. I live near the Point No Point Lighthouse in Hansville and these are in front of our house.

We have been watching
orcas since noon
today. It was hard to tell how many there really were as they were spread out from
Bush point to Double Bluff
and beyond. A group of 6 - 10 are still hanging around at
3:20 pm just north of point no point moving towards three tree point. There were at least 3 big males and numerous females and a very small orca.

12 to 20 orcas
(including males) spotted
between Hansville and Double Bluff on Whidbey Island
. Traveling eastbound toward Point No Point (towards Seattle) Observed between

2:00 and
3:00 p.m.
.

2:44 pm
- can't seem to peel myself away from those
orca
dots far far away...yes, at
Hansville
, yes heading south.

2:25 pm
- Looks like they are at
Hansville
, I think still southerly. Hard to tell, I am back at
Useless bay
and withot elevation I can only see blows thru the mirror image blows throu the waterline.
2 pm
- Yes, still slow movement southerly dir. Cargo ship split down the middle of them, harrowing from this vantage point. Pretty sure some orca took advantage of the wake, I'm sure I saw some wake surfing. Will check video when home. They are not yet to Hansville.

2 pm
- Alisa Brooks reports the [
orcas
] have turned back
south toward Puget Sound
, but slo-o-o-owly, and may stall out or turn around any time.

We have been watching a pod of what we believe are
Orcas
outside our house near
Foul Weather Bluff (northern Kitsap Peninsula)
. The appears to be 9-12 in the pod and they are between Hansville's Skunk Bay and Whidby Island. We are watching them currently at

1:30-
2:00 PM on Sunday, Nov 20, 2011. At this point, they appear to be feeding so, we aren't noting a direction of travel. The sighting is approximately 2 miles away (winds are quiet, so it's easier to see).
