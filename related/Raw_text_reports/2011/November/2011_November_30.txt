Orca Sightings for November 30, 2011
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw a very l
arge pod of orcas
, approximately 15 to 20 individuals,
heading south in Colvos Passage at
3:00 pm
. They were in the area of Driftwood cove (approximately N 47deg 28' by W 122 deg 30') about 2 miles south of the Southworth Ferry terminal. They milled around feeding for about a half of an hour, from
2:45pm to
3:15pm, before again slowly proceeding south in the passage. One of the males put on a great display, breaching clear of the water four times. I have included images. However, due to the late day, overcast light and the great distance to the orcas, the image quality is poor. I hope they help with identification. While I have seen orcas here before, I have never seen them milling in one spot for so long. They usually just pass through quite quickly. This was fantastic!

What an incredible day with the
SRKWs
! Started with the whales foraging
between Blake and Vashon Islands
. They began heading into
Colvos Passage
, and the trailing group porpoised past me on
Vashon Point
just 30 feet away! My sincere apologies for no video--the gale winds were whipping waves of about 5 feet, and my hands were frozen inside ski gloves. Then, to end my day, first a single breach and then FOUR whales in the air together in the distance near Gig Harbor! I hope someone else saw that!

4:26 pm
- Amy Carey called to say the orcas were at the south end of
Vashon Island
, with some still in Gig Harbor, but most in the triangle b
etween Vashon Island and the Tacoma Narrows
as the sun went down.
*

4:00 to
4:30 PM
- About
12 to 15 Male, female orcas and babies
at 47 degrees 22'44.22 N 122 deg 31"29.55 W at
Pt Richmond Beach
area
Gig Harbor
. We have seen Orcas moving north and south in the past, but never so many. Traveling South in Colvos Pass along the West side of Vashon Island. They were fairly spread out from about 2 miles north of Buoy #6 off of Pt Richmond Beach and a mile south of the same buoy. They were center channel to more to the Vashon side of the pass. A few seemed to stay in the same area for a while going south and turning back to the north, rolling and turning. There are about 10 to 12 Sea Lions off of Pt Richmond Beach and they were very close to the shore just inside of the buoy line and bunched together. They headed south when the Orcas were moving South and when the Orcas were mid channel and near buoy #6 the Sea Lions grouped together and swam quickly north along the buoy line. I think the orcas may have been feeding mid channel because there was a lot of turning and splashing about.

About

4:20pm -
At least one of the pods was sighted off of
Point Richmond Beach on Colvos Passage
. The pod came from the north at a slow pace. Some of the orca were spread across the entire passage. Several breaches were witnessed One smaller whale completely cleared the water like a smaller porpoise might do. The whales passed the point in about a 35 minute time span. Lighting was not so good due to overcast and time of day.

I live in
Olalla, WA
on the west side of Colvos Passage just south of
Olalla Bay
. We are watching a large pod of Orca's eating and playing about 3/4 of a mile to the east of us between us and Vashion Island.

3:00 p.m. -
We had well more than a dozen Orcas in
Colvos Passage
(west side of Vashon Island) this afternoon. I live on the west shore of the Passage, Â½ mile north of
Olalla Bay, at Prospect Point
. The whales were headed southbound. They were spread out quite far, both from north to south and across the Passage. At first the wind-driven waves, chop and whitecaps were so large it made it hard to observe or photograph them from the beach. They turned briefly northbound as a tug and barge came near them through the Passage, then resumed their southerly travel. I continued watching them for about an hour until they rounded the corner toward Point Defiance and the Narrows Bridge and I could no longer see them even with binoculars. There was at least one huge dorsal fin, possibly two, presumably male. They covered about 5 miles during the hour I observed them, headed south. I will download my photos and if any of them are worth sending along, I'll do so.
