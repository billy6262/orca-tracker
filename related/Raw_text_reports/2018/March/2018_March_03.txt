...I left Victoria harbor on Mike 1 at ~
1715 and arrived at Secretary Island as the lead whales K27 and K42 passed by the south tip of Secretary Island traveling east
. I could see that the bulk of the animals trailing were closer to shore and fairly grouped up.

4:58 p.m. - T2Cs
, I see them at
County Park
, now, maybe a mile offshore just hanging at the surface. -Monika Wieland Shields

Bigg's/Transient killer whales -
Transient Orcas at Point Roberts, WA
. Today around
4pm
there were
at least 4 orcas off shore viewed from Point Roberts Lighthouse Park
heading up the Strait towards Deltaport BC. They were transients and were hunting poroises - twice we saw a porpoise tossed high in the air by a whale. One whale had a larger dorsal fin than the others. They moved quite quickly past the Point then circled around an area offshore where we had earlier seen porpoises. The orcas were blowing and surfacing frequently. Very dramatic. We watched for about 20 mins. -Anne Murray

8-9 Transient Orcas southbound, Lambert channel (Denman/Hornby Is)...around 9am

Entry 3:
4th gray off Snohomish Delta -
5:19 p.m
. - Just saw a blow! We are at Legion Park looking straight out into the flats toward Camano (directionally) -through binoculars. We are looking west northwest north end of Jetty Island flats. First sighting of the season (not on our boat). We have seen multiple blows-we think they are feeding in the flats. Too far for phone photos but very cool! Harley thinks there is just one, but I'm not sure. -Sharon Clark

The grays are here in numbers...it was a beautiful day out there watching them travel all snugged up together. Here are
gray whales 53, 56, & 723 while southbound in Possession Sound from just south of the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes
to just north of Possession Point. There were times I thought I was seeing three, and turns out all three were there. Confused as there turned out to be a 4th up near Everett.

3:33 p.m. - these beauties (grays) have rounded Possession Point
and are currently on the south side of it hugging Whidbey side, heading west.

2:55 p.m. - these looks like 3 grays
are maintaining steady
southbound
, still west of mid channel.
Approaching Possession Point
. They are sticking close together, often surfacing in tandem.

1:50 p.m. - 2 grays still steady southbound west of mid channel at about Glendale, Whidbey
. Viewing from Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach.

1:18 p.m. -
finally see the
grays heading southbound mid channel right in middle of Mukilteo/Clinton Ferry lanes

, so aiming towards northside of Hat but currently still southeast of Sandy Point.
