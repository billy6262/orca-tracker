Orca Sightings for March 19, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Depoe Bay, Oregon -
Carrie Newell called in a report of
L pod orcas off Depoe Bay on
March 19 & 20
: Monday the 19th they saw
20 - 25 whales
, 3 open saddles, 3 males, 2 calves (one juvenile and one very small calf), right
off Depoe bay by the bell buoy, heading south
. She then sent this report:
Met them just south of the Depoe Bay buoys in 80 feet of water traveling south at 5 knots. 4 minute dive cycles with 1-2 minutes at surface. Met them on 3-19-2018 at
12:40pm and left them around 2pm just south of Cape Foulweather. N 44 47 640 and W 124 05 044 there were 4-5 males and 2 calves. Assumed L pod from San Juans. Initially doing abreast behavior but 45 minutes later spread out in small groups separated by as much as 1/4 mile. On
3-20-2018 my other captains encountered 5 orcas traveling south
at 5 knots in 60 feet of water. 4 females and one adult male. Noon encounter. - Carrie Newell - Whale Research EcoExcursions (Depoe Bay, Oregon)
(
Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research preliminary IDs: "L72, L90, definitely there." Melisa Pinnow , CWR took a look later at photos on a passenger's Facebook page and ID'd: "
L4s, and the L47s and L72s
. The L26s were probably there too but I don't see them in the photos. So it looks like L pod minus the L12s and L54s."

Entry 2:
Orcas in Howe Sound
today: This was about

3:20pm between Keats Island and Bowen Island
. They were heading North East up the Sound. That little island behind them is called Hutt Island I think and it looked like they were going to take the passage between that and Bowen. -Photo by Lauren Elizabeth,

Entry 4:
Spieden Channel
- Today I went out on the boat for the first time in nearly a year. First, we came across an eagle enjoying a snack. Then we caught up with the
T2Cs
heading north along
Spieden Island. Tumbo
was lagging behind, but the family would pause at times to let him catch him up. Eventually they launched an attack on a harbor seal. Tumbo sat just a short ways off, simply watching his family hunt. He'd surface every so often in the same exact spot and log at the surface, never taking his eyes off his family working without him to make the kill. When the hunt was over, Tumbo headed over to his family to join in on the feast. Afterwards they continued north and we headed home. A beautiful day with a special family of whales, who demonstrate care and compassion for their disabled family member. It's a beautiful thing,
T2C1 Rocky. T2C2 Tumbo

While we were out doing some work with the new Western Explorer II, we decided to have a look at the
T2Cs
family group of Bigg's Killer whales that were nearby. As we arrived, a hunt on a Steller Sea lion began. Shortly after, something interesting happened.
20+ Steller Sea lions came to the hunted one's defense
. They grouped up together watching for the Killer whales, and when they were close enough to the singeled out one, that animal made a break for it swimming at high speed until he got into the raft of sea lions. It was facinating to watch. The orcas swam around the scene for a little while, before turning and heading away from the scene. -Facebook video by Traci Walter HERE.

Marie Waterman at WS Ferries relayed a report of at least
2 adult orcas in San Juan Channel

6:04 p.m. - Definitely 2 whales heading towards Hat
northeasterly. Currently between Mukilteo and Hat.

5:45 p.m. - at least one gray between Mukilteo/Clinton Ferry lanes and Hat island

4:35 p.m. - Two Grays feeding south of Tulalip Bay

1440- #185
slowly making way north now.
Approx

2:13pm - #49 Patch
and just now joining PCFG CRC-185 on
southeast side of Gedney
. Got to meet the newcomer,
PCFG CRC-#185! off Snohomish Delta
. He/she has got some really beautiful curvy flukes. 185 breached in distance (of course) and then proceeded to travel over to the delta where he/she then began to feed in the shallows and we could see the flukes and pec fins. Fun day! -Photo by Renee Beizel,
