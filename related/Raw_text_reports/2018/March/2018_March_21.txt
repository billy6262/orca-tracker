Orca Sightings for March 21, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents -
In mid-day whales were reported inbound in the Strait of Juan de Fuca somewhere near Race rocks, very spread out and taking long dives. Hoping they might be J pod returning, Ken set out in Chimo and headed toward Seabird Point, Discovery Island where they were reportedly heading. However, the whales stalled out near the end of an ebbing tide and were foraging toward William Head on the south Vancouver Island coast. The dives were long, the whales very spread over at least ten square miles, and the situation was at first backlit; but,
they were J pod

Entry 2:
8:45 a.m - Spotted four Orcas in the Satellite Channel
, between Mill Bay, BC and Cow Bay, BC. Identified as
T2C, with her newish calf, T2C4, and eldest son T2C1, plus one other female trailing behind (possibly T2C3)
. Group meandered past slowly, surfacing many times, heading west down the Channel
towards Cherry Point, and the Samsun Narrows
. Wonderful to see them this morning! They appears to be feeding as well as traveling:three together, and another female trailing behind a little. 48.695512/-123.540502 -Deirdre Zlomanchuk

Gray whale #22 Earhart
, the female who was struck by a boat last year, has returned! We are pleased to see her especially since some years she does not come inland. We will share any health updates by Cascadia Research once they have a chance to observe her and/or see enough photo-documentation. -Photo by Justine Buckmaster,

March 21- Possession Sound - Another amazing day on the Chilkat Express with the Sounders! In fact, 'amazing' doesn't quite cut it, today was downright magical. We sat in the presence of
4 gray whales
for over an hour while they circled and socialized nearby. We greeted
#22 Earhart
back to Puget Sound for the first time this year, and it was a relief to see her looking well after last year's boat strike. We also saw
#49 Patch, #53 Little Patch, and #383
who was closely escorting #22 Earhart. We saw some really interesting behavior from #383 as #53 Little Patch approached him and #22, including 3 head rises and bubble blasts! Lots of fluking and rainblows as well! The left side of #22 Earhart. Remember, if you see a blow, go slow! -Justine Buckmaster

Harbor porpoise -

Entry 5:
11:00 a.m
- Hi- I was up at
West Beach at Deception Pass State Park
this morning and saw
a lot of what I believe to be harbor porpoises
, I have seen them up there before but not so many. They were strung out in a very long line and attracting a lot of gulls and eagles that were flying overhead. It was impossible to count them but there
must have been dozens
