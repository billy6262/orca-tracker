, Dave spotted
blows in Swanson Channel. Nearly all of J pod
was traveling in two tight groups off of Stanley Point on North Pender Island. The
lead group was made up of the J16s and J17s. The trailing group was made up of the J14s, J22s, J27, J31, and J46. K21 was further out in the channel
and paralleling the two groups by a few hundred yards...Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 11.

The stars aligned yesterday and we were able to get out and spend some time with the endangered southern resident killer whales! They were very
spread across the Strait of Georgia but it looked like all of J Pod
was present and possibly K Pod members but no positive ID's on those. For sure, we had
J16, J50, J37, J49, J26, L87, J38 and J22
