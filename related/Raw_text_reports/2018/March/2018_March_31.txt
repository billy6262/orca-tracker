Entry 2:
The sperm whale that had been sighted in Johnstone Strait in February made an appearance in the San Juan Islands
and I (feeling like I won the lottery) was lucky enough to see him. I've included a link to the BLOG POST I helped write about Yukusam for Maya's Legacy Whale Watching (with more photos and a video that has audio of him echolocating). Never did I imagine I would see a sperm whale (my first ever!) here in the Salish Sea, let alone in Haro Strait as the sun disappeared behind Vancouver Island. Yukusam, you are amazing! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Sperm whale
, that is! Yukusam the sperm whale was spotted
in Haro Strait
last night during our first sunset whale watch & wildlife tour of 2018. Usually living in the deep waters of the Pacific coast, he is a very rare visitor to the island waters of the Salish Sea! Sperm whales are the largest toothed predators on the planet and can grow to lengths of 60 feet.
First spotted mid February in northeast Vancouver Island
, the sperm whale slowly made his way south. This is the first ever sighting of a sperm whale in the waters surrounding San Juan Island. -Photo of the day and photo below by Capt. Sarah McCullagh, San Juan Safaris

I was captain onboard J1, which departed Friday Harbor at
4:00 PM and were headed to Swanson Channel to catch up with J pod. As we were crossing Boundary Pass we spotted a huge blow in the pass, followed by a fluke. At first we thought it was a humpback but it was across the pass and we didn't get a great look. We waited 25 minutes with no other surfacing and moved on to J pod. About 20 minutes later San Juan Safaris reacquired and confirmed it was a
sperm whale Yukusam off Turn Point, Stuart Island.
After a 35 - 40 minute dive, J1 and Forever Wild spotted the next surfacing offshore of the Turn Point lighthouse. -Jeff Friedman, Maya's Legacy

Scott Veirs of OrcaSound.net shared THIS BLOG POST, with links to listen in to the
incredible vocals heard from "Yukusam" the Sperm whale
as he traveled down
Haro Strait
last night, after being seen off Turn Point by several whale watch boats
*
In case you missed it: the
sperm whale nicknamed Yukusam was echolocating in Haro Strait for over 3 hours on the evening
of
March 31st! This is the same whale that was seen in Johnstone Strait in mid-February (the first confirmed sperm whale there since 1984), and we believe this is also the first documented sperm whale in Washington's inland waters. This 5 minute clip encompasses a nice variety of the clicks we heard from him this evening! Pretty special! -Monika Wieland Shields

After receiving several reports throughout the morning of
J pod on the west side of San Juan Island
, Dave, Darren, and Lodie met at Snug Harbor and left in the boat just before
1300
. We got on scene ten minutes later about
three quarters of a mile northwest of the Lime Kiln lighthouse
. We shut down on the edge of the scene to get a sense of what the whales were doing. A large, tight group of whales approached slowly from the south. This was all of the
J11s, J14s, and J19s
and they filed right by the boat in a nice pass and then began heading west across the strait....See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 22.

Orca soup off the west side of San Juan
today! Mostly in the middle, don't know of any close to shore but you can see lime kiln way in the distance. Saw
J17s, L87, J22s
and a few others. We didn't see the 16s. -Cassie Barclay

March 31st was another awesome day on the water with probably
14 mammal eating orcas.
They were heading from
Campbell River to Comox
with many of them very, very close to the Vancouver Island shores. -Peter Hamilton

Entry 6:
two Grays in Crescent Harbor last night
just after high tide (starting at about

6:30PM
) (
March 31) feeding until sunset. One was much farther and couldn't be captured well.

just after high tide and until sunset, just feet from Kes and his family, their first experience! His little ones will have this beautiful connection with #44, an experience they can hold with them through out their lives! Our family's first whale watching experience! Spectacular animals! -Kes Andrius

2:44 p.m. - Spotted a blow off Baby Island
. Headed south off Camano state park. -Sara Wright

A beautiful sunny spring day! On our first trip of the day, we went out to
Camano Head, where we caught up with gray whale #531
as she was foraging for delectable ghost shrimp. We then found
#22, Earhart, on the east side of Gedney Island
, close to shore and blowing bubble blasts as she surfaced. Turning east,
#49, Patch
, gave us some great looks at his namesake marking and a nice tail fluke. Further southeast,
Shackleton
was in deeper water. On the afternoon trip, we found
#22
again, and were treated to even nicer tail fluke up dives after she turned away from the shallow Snohomish River Delta.
#49
was also in that area. As we headed back to Langley, we found an unidentified gray very close to shore, just south of Sandy Point. This whale was in such shallow water that he/she was on the side, with one pectoral (front) flipper up in the air, and at times, showing both the front pec and one side of the tail flukes. The backlit blows really showed the lovely heart shape of a gray whale's exhalation. Another wonderful day on the water! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

11:02 a.m - 22 and 53 south side of Gedney. 49 to the east and we found 531 between Camano Head and Gedney

March 31 ~

7:00 p.m. -
On Saturday evening, just before sunset, my daughter, girlfriend, and I were on
Samish Overlook
and we saw
a HUGE whale
in the water, very near the shore, just south of Colony Creek...I remember the moment, looking below and seeing what looked like a long dark spear moving perpendicularly away from the coast. It took me a moment to be sure that it was something, and I asked my daughter, who has sharper vision, if she saw it, and she said, "it's HUGE". We saw it moving about near the surface or just under it, on and off for a few minutes. Then we saw it no more. We tried to compare it to a long vessel that was anchored just north of Colony Creek...It looked much bigger than 20-30 feet to me. So, my hunch is that the whale was 40-50 feet long. At first it was swimming at, or near the surface, straight as an arrow, perpendicularly away from the coast fairly fast. It looked just like that, a long thin arrow moving away from the coast. It was as though it might have moved in to chase a seal, which had escaped by going onto the dyke, and the whale now was heading back out to deep water. It stopped about 200-300 ft from shore and stayed near that area, resting, swimming in small circles, occasionally diving deep enough to be out of view. Then we saw it no more. -Myron Shekelle
