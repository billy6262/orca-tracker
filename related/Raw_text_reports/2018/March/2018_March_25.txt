March 25 (
possible sperm whale
) - We had a message from Nickolaus Dee Lewis of Lummi; two Lummi fisherman saw a whale they thought
may have been a sperm whale as it had a bulbous head
- it surfaced close to their boat and seemed to hover, they said it stuck its head out of the water for awhile - then it went back under and they didn't see it again, they were concerned by its behavior that it might be hurt or sick. This was late afternoon/early evening off Carter Pt, So. end of Lummi. (more of original report below along with Jared Towers reply)
"One of my buddies (Randingo Kinley) just called me and told me they seen a sperm whale or fin whale that appeared to be hurt somehow, wasn't acting normal. Was off Carter Point off south end of Lummi island they may have got the whale description wrong, but said it was a large whale and just how it appeared they did try waiting for it after noticing it, but it didn't come back up after they noticed it, and slowed down to look more at it. Just wanted to send it as a FYI case get any other reports."
Thanks for this Susan and Howie. The sperm whale we had in Johnstone Strait was detected acoustically and or visually almost every day between
February 11th and
March 18th. Since the 18th there has been no sign of him. Based on comparisons with boat size as well as body measurements estimated from acoustic recordings he was about 45 feet long. His surface and dive behaviour was quite normal and his body condition appeared healthy from photographs and underwater video. Given his long dives, short surfacing intervals and active acoustic behaviour, the best way to confirm if he is around is probably acoustically. I'll be interested to hear if his presence down there can be verified. -Jared Towers, DFO

Yukusam the sperm whale was indeed identified

Hey! I'm watching a non orca whale (was a
gray whale
) in the cove on the
Whidbey sea plane base
. Next to the exchange. Been here for at least 15 mins...He's staying in a pretty tight radius. Occasionally I will see half a fluke. She doesn't appear to be going anywhere. -Carey Varas

Feeding this morning (3/25). Still feeding off Maylor Point at 0905 today.
Two, possibly three greys at the entrance of Oak Harbor

March 25 - South Saratoga/Possession Sound - We were fortunate with weather today, chilly, but beautifully calm water in Possession Sound as we took off in search of gray whales. Soon after leaving Langley we found
#531 feeding on the north east side of Hat (Gedney) Island
, showing her fluke on shallow dives. A little further to the south we found two more whales, the iconic
#49 Patch traveling with #53 Little Patch
- fun to see them together as they also fluked on several shallow dives. We were fortunate to have Elliott Menashe from Greenbelt Consulting on board today - educating us on land-slides on both Whidbey and Camano Islands as we viewed them from Mystic Sea. An interesting day for sure. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Hello, On Sunday,...I was sitting on a bench in
Hibulb Park, Everett
(Legion Park), with a pair of great binoculars. Starting at around

2:30 PM
for about 30 min, I could observe blows from three whales between Everett and Clinton, closer to the Whidbey. ...there were spouts from another
three or four whales
closer to me and in front of
Jetty Island
. I saw a lot of fluke or fin action... I am very excited to have found Orca Network, read the reports every day, and would like to learn more about it. -Thank you, Barbara Inge Karsch

She was the only whale. We saw her right after high tide, so probably from

11:30 to about
12:30
. First spotted her closer to Whidbey and watched her make her way over to
Mabana
. I believe it is the same (re; pec photo - alb). This was taken right off the county road where people launch their boats. Think there used to be a dock there long ago.

Fred Lundahl called in a report of a single
gray whale seen from Langley
, feeding off
Sandy Pt.
then heading across Saratoga Passage toward Camano Island and possibly up toward Langley.
*

8:40 a.m - Saw gray whale
(back of camera photo shared shows
#22
-alb) just past buoys on west side of
Sandy Point
, Whidbey looking like she was heading across to Camano side kind of west northerly. -Marilyn Armbruster

Minke whales -

Entry 3:
Minke in Admiralty inlet seen from ferry at 1315
. -Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research
*
Unidentified cetacean -

Entry 4:
likely minke
or a really big Dall's) mid crossing on the

11:00 am Port Townsend/Keystone ferry crossing
. I saw the back and heard the blow two times and did not see a large dorsal. I'm pretty familiar with the whales of our area. It was one animal and headed towards PT. Some folks on the ferry said orca but I did not see a dorsal, certainly not a large one. It was definitely bigger than a porpoise. Not a gray. Minke or orca. Too large to be Harbor porpoise. Possible juvenile minke and certain it was alone. Down time ~ 2-3 minutes when we saw it. -Andrea Vance
