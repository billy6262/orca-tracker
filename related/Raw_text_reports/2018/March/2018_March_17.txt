Orca Sightings for March 17, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
T2Cs, T37As, T99s -
7:10 pm -
pods have moved over to Whidbey side and just now passing by
north side Double Bluff south end Mutiny Bay
, loosely spread with
T2C2
trailing behind all. Up until Bush Point they were in steady travel mode, with some lazy tail loves and inverted rolls. After Bush they slowed down and began traveling in resting spread in groups of 1-3s by the time they reached Double Bluff near darkness. Amazing day...which got more amazing watching 5 otters scampering off the beach into the sea just now!
T2Cs, T37As, and T99s

We left the marina with reports of at least two of our "Sounders" gray whales close by, so we headed south to catch up with
#49, Patch
. He was surfacing erratically, with very little deep diving, as he was in a fairly shallow area just
south of Gedney Island
. After he did a nice fluke up tail dive, we turned north into calmer waters. After a good scan with no spouts, we headed back south and caught up with one of our female whales,
#531
. She too was shallow diving, but did do a couple of nice fluke up dives. Another great day with lovely whales and passengers! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

ID notes by Dave Anderson Cascadia Research: "Dave Glenn sent me the rest of his photos. While none of them were clear enough on their own for an ID, there are enough hints between them to suggest that
this animal could be Stump
. One of the images, when really zoomed in, shows probable nicks in about the right places, and another one from head on shows the bend in the dorsal fin. Thanks to Dave and the Seattle Aquarium!" -Photo by Dave Glenn,
