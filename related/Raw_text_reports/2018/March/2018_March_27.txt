Entry 2:
a sperm whale off Nanaimo
today. Same individual that Jared had in Johnstone Strait a couple of weeks ago. Got ID photos and recordings. Last seen heading NE off Pipers Lagoon just before dark. Spotted the sperm whale from shore
off north Nanaimo around noon
. We (John Ford, Brianna Wright, and Eva Stredulinsky) encountered him a couple of hours later off the entrance to Departure Bay heading south. He proceeded down Northumberland Channel off the west side of Gabriola Island, diving for 30-40 minutes between periods at the surface. He turned back before
going through Dodd Narrows
at the bottom of Northumberland Channel, and was last seen just
west of Departure Bay at dusk
. This is the same whale that Jared Towers and the folks at OrcaLab observed and recorded in Johnstone Strait from mid February to
March 18 - he was given the name Yukusam up there. -Best, John Ford, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada

Entry 4:
Utsalady Bay
today, these were the best I could get from about a mile away ... looking northwest from Arrowhead point with Whidbey Island in the background. Are these
gray whales
, they look small to me...thanks so much....Basically, it looked to me they were going down to the bottom (its shallow in Utsalady bay) then the would come back up approx every 1-2 minutes and not in the same location they went down and 'spout' then we would see their black shark like fin raise to the surface but it would rise and fall (up/down) rather than roll and I never saw the classic tails. I understand that grays have butterfly shaped spouts and these seemed to blow more upwards but the wind is blowing around 10mph. I saw two of these one was further south of us in the sunshine so unable to get a good pic, he/she was due west between us and Poinell Point.
