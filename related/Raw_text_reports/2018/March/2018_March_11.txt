Orca Sightings for March 11, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1310, J19 and J39 were found 4 miles north of Porlier Pass, east of Valdez Island in Georgia Strait
. The two were spread out and slowly traveling southbound. A few whales were visible far to the east, so "Morning Star" slowly worked its way in that direction. Twenty minutes later,
J41 and J51
were located. The pair was foraging together and after a bit of milling, a salmon was rammed out of the water by J41. -Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 14.

An absolutely stunning evening in the
Strait of Georgia with J pod
! Crawling through all the photos now but loved this one of
J37 and possibly J40
in double spyhop mode. This turned into a triple spyhop believe it or not! -Photo by Gary Sutton,

Entry 4:
San Juan Channel -
5:27 p.m.
- Checking out the San Juan Islands for some boat in camping and hiking yesterday and found this amazing family of Orcas along the way. They were very far when we saw them, cut the engine and waited. The new born was very curious and ended up going under and around the boat several times with his momma looking at us. It was breathtaking as the male ushered them off. Pod of
6 or 7 all together

Entry 5:

For a brief moment in the sun-dappled waters at the mouth of Friday Harbor mother and son paused, side by side at the surface. I found myself wondering at what the moment held between the two of them, but only a small part of me because the moment belonged to them and only them.
Tasu (T002C) and Tumbo (T002C2)
. First time seeing whales from Reuben Tarte and what an amazing encounter it was...Here's Tumbo (T002C2) and his mom, Tasu (T002C) and older brother, Rocky (T002C1). I love seeing them all together and this also shows some of the curvature of Tumbo's spine from scoliosis. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

The
T002Cs
milling and killing for over an hour back and forth. Truly an amazing morning. Check out
T2C2
!! I thought he had a chunk of seal, but turns out that seal chunk had legs!!! Some kind of seabird, perhaps a common murre? I watched him actually suck it into his mouth before he went underwater, so not sure what happened after that. Fun times with many of my fellow whale nerds on land and on the water! -Photo by Traci Walter,

Holy bejeezus, what a morning!!! Absolutely incredible encounter with the
T2Cs at Reuben Tarte County Park
. They meandered off the rocks for ages, playing and slaying. Awesome to spend the morning with some of my favorite dorcas too! WOOT!
T2C2 Tumbo
and his curvy spine.

just passed
Friday Harbor southbound
still on the San Juan side of the Channel.

12:02 p.m. - T2Cs back by O'Neal
going south now, after hanging
close to Reuben Tarte
for the last long while! Milling and killing like crazy.

10:15 a.m - Looks like T2Cs, still south of O'Neal Island
moving slow.

9:20 a.m - 4 orcas NB Point Caution
. Reuben Tarte is definitely the new Lime Kiln! The T2Cs were milling and killing out there for over an hour this morning - that male right off the rocks is (appropriately) T2C1 Rocky. Reuben Tarte County Park. (The T2Cs have a remarkable story as a family, both past and present. Read Monika's blog about this family: Part 1: Meet the T2Cs AND Part 2: An Epic Encounter with the T2Cs ) -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 8:
Patch #49, Little Patch #53 and #383 graced the shores off Camano Head
as they made their way south slowly but surely toward Hat Island in the warm afternoon sunshine. They were not the only Californian visitors - three curious California sea-lions couldn't resist a good look around, and a pair of watchful bald eagles perched on pilings didn't miss a trick. A wonderful weekend of wildlife and nature's best. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist. (photos below by Richard Snowberger)
