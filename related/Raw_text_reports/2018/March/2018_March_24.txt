Orca Sightings for March 24, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents -
J39 "Mako" and J47 "Notch"
were hanging out together yesterday evening and did this synchronized pec slap as they were socializing. Too cute! -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu

J Pod and L87 were in Strait of Georgia
late afternoon on the far side of the strait
across from Vancouver and Point Roberts
. They were spread out in small groups of 3-4 whales leisurely working their way south. I have never seen them this relaxed and social before. Many different animals breached and surface play, tail slaps, pec slaps and rolling around were nearly constant.
Mako
gave us a full-on double breach and Nova got some big air as well. We probably saw at least ten breaches in the time spent with them. There was also some PG-13 sea snake play.

A few photos attached from our late afternoon trip with
J pod
. ...We came on scene with J pod around
5 PM in the Strait of Georgia, just south of Active Pass
, as they traveled south. They continued south, with lots of play and social behavior. -Photo by Jeff Friedman,

Another magic day with
Orcas around Hornby and Denman Islands
, all day. I recognized the ones in the Lambert channel from last Sunday. I believe the 124A's and 86A's. Saw the Whales feast on a couple seals and spent all afternoon in my kayak.
T124A2A, T124D2, and T124D1, T124D and T124D2, (maybe T86A4), (maybe T86A1) with T124A2, T86A, T86A3, and calf (maybe T124A2B), T124A2 and T124A2A

, across from the city at the spit that juts out about 1/2 mile from the city streets.

Over the noon hour we observed
two to three grey whales
leisurely spouting, diving, and rolling
off SW Gedney (Hat) Island
. From our vantage point on the 200 foot bluff we saw the greys slowly moving north on the west side. Three observation boats were in the area part of the time. Wonderful to see them. -Chuck Howell

11:45 a.m - We also saw #21 Shackleton
just south of
Elger Bay
heading SW down Saratoga Passage at about
11:45.

south of Sandy Point

Welcome back Sounder
#22 (Earhart)
, who survived a boat strike last year. Is it any wonder that #22 is named after Amelia Earhart for her pioneering feeding technique? Today we witnessed that first-hand as #22 exhibited the highly specialized (and strategically risky) behavior of feeding close to shore in shallow water, with her pectoral fin and partial 10-12 foot long flukes exposed above the surface as she dug deep in the sediment for crustaceans south of Sandy Point, near Langley. After leaving Earhart we spent some time with #383 between Whidbey and Hat Island, before joining
#49 (Patch) and #53 (Little Patch) south of Hat Island
. And that wasn't the end of it... We spotted another whale, possibly
#21 or newcomer CRC-185 heading towards Everett
while stopping along the way to check out ghost-shrimp buffet. So much action in a relatively small space and short time-frame with these magnificent giants who choose to visit us every spring. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist (Photos Richard Snowberger, Crew)

It was nice to see the sun again today! It was still a bit chilly in the morning, but with the help of some hot cider (thanks Michael), I stayed out on the bow of the San Juan Clipper to get a good look at some of our Sounders. The first whale we spotted was
#22 Earhart
feeding just south of
Langley
in shallow water along the shore of Whidbey Island. We got really good looks at her pectoral fins and flukes as she rolled to feed close to the beach! We also caught up with
#21 Shackleton
a little further north. Later, on our way back to Seattle, we encountered #531 as she crossed Saratoga Passage to Camano Head. She fluked several times giving us some nice looks at her unique scarring patterns. -Justine Buckmaster
