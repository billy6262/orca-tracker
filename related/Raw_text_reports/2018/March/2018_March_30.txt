Blowing spotted off

Grey whale 125 yards off Bells Beach at 2pm
today. It was heading towards Langley. -Rick Lessley

We were fortunate to quickly find
2 of our "Sounders" just south of Langley, #49 Patch, feeding with #22 Earhart on the west side of Hat/Gedney Island
- their shallow dives giving us many great views as they slowly traveled southbound. We then headed towards
Cama Head and found #53, Little Patch
, who seemed to be on a mission towards the north. So we headed on into Port Susan and discovered
#21 Shackleton feeding along Kayak Point
. He was very close to shore, only a few people on shore watching as he meandered back and forth. So good to see 4 of our gray whales - on a very welcome sunny day with no wind - is spring finally here? -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

#21 Feeding just north of Kayak Point at around
1:30 today

Two grey whales off Everett spotted this afternoon at
1:45 pm.
About 2.5 miles north of Everett Naval base. They surprised us by popping up right next to the boat. Traveling very slowly. But not diving very often, so they didn't appear to be feeding. 47 59.919'N 122 16.152'W. -Photo by Russ Waughmab,
