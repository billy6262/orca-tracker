#21
1115 - sporadic feeding, #49 was further from Hat
, unidentifiable 2nd Gray Whale now closer to Hat Island. I don't believe this 2nd Gray is a Sounder. I've got good ID pictures of both left and right side, no match yet.

Photos of the
gray whale who was not a Sounder
observed today
off Hat Island (along with known Sounders)
were sent to Cascadia Research. Turns out it is a known individual from the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG): "Alie recognized this whale right away as one of our PCFG regulars,
CRC-185
. Well over 200 sightings of this whale going back to 1996 with most sightings being off S Vancouver Island. Unusual for it to be in this area and will be interesting to see if it sticks around." - John Calambokidis

March 16 - Saratoga Passage - After a long 8.5 hour busy day on my feet at work, I went for another 2 mile roundtrip beach walk to watch
gray whales just east of Polnell Pt as the sun set
. Gorgeous evening (3/16) with gray whales
#383, #723, and at least one other
.

Entry 7:
three or four Orcas
very close to the shore on
Marrowstone Point
. I heard another report of a sighting here yesterday. They were definitely headed north when I spotted them,and truthfully I think now it may have only been two. The came around the point and headed north,it was about
10am
on
March 16th. I got some video but they came out of the water again directly west of the point. They appeared to be passing through,I didn't see any more of them after that. I'm just here on a work assignment and this is my first Orca sighting,so I feel pretty lucky! -Marty Garcia

Entry 8:
a group of orcas from the hiway between Clallam Bay and Bullman Beach
(west of Neah Bay) Friday afternoon, traveling west. Watched for them from Bullman, but did not see them pass. -M McElravy

Entry 9:
Burrows Pass of Fidalgo Island
. There were 4-5 with a fairly young calf. The pics aren't great (my camera settings were off), but may be able to ID. They only came in for a few minutes, moved up against the kelp on Fidalgo Island a bit, then went back out into the Strait. It was very exciting!! -Thanks, Cindy R. Elliser, PhD, Research Director, Pacific Mammal Research
