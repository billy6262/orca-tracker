Orca Sightings for March 1, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound grays
have arrived! "We were so excited to watch them with the setting sun behind their blows! The first two were taken while they appeared to be
feeding just west of Langley
." -Photo by Peg Boley,

Entry 2:
5:15 pm
today, we had our first sighting of
grey whales (we think there were two
, because they blew the same time) in front of Langley. We could easily see them from
Pebble Beach on Camano
. They seemed to be feeding just NW of the town, then moved out into Saratoga Passage. Feeding just
NW of Langley, then moving SE towards Hat Island
. Watched them for about 30 minutes. At first they seem to be feeding just NW of the town of Langley. When two boats passed, they moved off, towards Hat Island not coming up as often...the whales (we were aware of two blows at one point, but the photos look like just one) moved away from Langley towards Hat Island. What a thrill - the water was so calm, and their blows were so loud. -Peg Boley

4:27 p.m. -
Currently we see spouting in
Saratoga Passage at Mabana Beach
area. The sun was in our eyes,no photos. Lots of big spouts You could barely see the whale from time to time. We could see the wake it left as it moved closer to Camano and south. With the sun in our eyes like that we can only guess that it was a grey whale slowly feeding as it went along. -Susanne Almberg

4:00 p.m. - At least two smaller whales traveling close to the surface going south through Saratoga Passage
. They were first observed from Camano near mid channel
off of Mabana
and last seen just south of Langley. Observed blowing at regular intervals for over an hour. They appeared to be slowly traveling south at a shallow depth. Even when not breaking the water it was possible to follow them through their wake on the calm surface. -Bob Anderson
*

1:30 p.m. - Gray whale Saratoga Passae off Hidden Beach
southbound. 14-16 minute down times 2 short breaths. Unable to ID. (possibly 1 of the 2 reported off Glendale this morning) -Eric Rosemore, Mystic Sea
*

Entry 3:
Possesssion Sound -
3:00 pm.
- S/he was feeding off their until I left around 3pm!

2:15 p.m. - Gray whale is still in same general area off Jetty Island
in general out from north end of the Everett Marina. Cruising back and forth rolling around engaged in typical feeding behavior. Gulls and other seabirds swooping in feeding as well. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

2:00 p.m. - 1 grey Whale
still in delta feeding. (
Snohomish Delta
). -Carl Williams
*

12:05 p.m. -
First of the returning grays that we could with confidence say was one of the North Puget Sounders due to location and feeding behavior. This whale fed off the Snohomish Delta all morning and well into the afternoon. I can confirm this gray whale is rolling in the mudflats off
Jetty Island
, presumably feeding on shrimp buried in the sand...a technique we know the "Sounders" have perfected. Been watching this behavior for the past 30 minutes. And her/his blows look very robust! Viewing from Legion Park in Everett.

11:20 a.m - Gray moved out from Jetty Island
maybe 1/2 mile westbound movement, but may just be circling around. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

10:49 a.m. -
Confirmed!! We can see the blow from
east side of Hat, just south of Tulalip
, near the sand bar marker. One individual heading north. -Lori Christopher
*

10:50 a.m. -
I can now confirm
blows off Jetty Island
about mid way up Jetty Island. The whales is just hanging in same area. Too far for IDs but is blow of big whale for sure!

10:10 a.m -
Saw first blows not far
offshore of Jetty Island
about mid way up. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

9:02 a.m. -
Happy
March 1st! I'm in the Everett Rucker Hill neighborhood and can see
whale blows (from one whale) between Hat and Jetty Island
, closer to Jetty than Hat. I'm a marine mammal biologist and knowing the area and time of year I suspect it's a gray whale however, the blow is not defined enough from my vantage point to say it's v-shaped or not. -Amy Willoughby
*

7:30 a.m - 2 grays around Glendale, Whidbey Island
. 3rd hand report from Eric, Mystic Sea relayed to him by Langley Harbor Master who heard from a boater this morning.
*
Jeannette Conover and her husband are caretakers of
Possession Point Park
and report seeing
a whale
(initially thinking orca) northbound
off Possession point towards Mukilteo/Clinton at
7:00 am
. After some discussion they believe it was a gray whale.
*
Unidentified whales -

Entry 4:
12:00 Noon - From the ferry leaving Kingston I saw 3 blows
about a minute apart. Could not see any signs indicating what kind of whale. (No view of dorsal, fluke, back) Closer to Kingston side, north of ferry lane, unable to determine direction of travel. -Connie Bickerton
