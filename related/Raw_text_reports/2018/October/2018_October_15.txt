Orca Sightings for October 15, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
...interesting group of
transients heading east off Dungeness Spit
. Along with the
T35As and T38As
, a male known as
U57
and several other unknown whales were reported to be with them...Along with the
six T35As and T38As
, there were four new whales other than U57...Besides U57, Jared says the other male is known as
U56
and both are the probable sons of a two nicked female known as
U36
. A medium sized juvenile present was
U36A
. The second unknown female sized whale who was present was
U137
. U137 seems to belong to the U36 group but his/her relationship to the others is unknown. Jared says DFO only has a few records of this group from near the shelf edge off northern Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii.

Started our day in the marina with a bald eagle, a seal and some other birds which I will add later. Five minutes off the dock we found our friend
Two Spot the humpback
, then we saw
another humpback named Masquerade/Cyclone
and then a
third HB named Zephyr
!! We were fortunate to be able to watch Two Spot lunge feed into a bird pile before we left to find more wildlife! Out in the Strait of Juan de Fuca Captain Brian was looking for whales and about 3 and 1/2 miles away he saw some!! Turned out to be appx. 10 transient orcas including
T38A's, T35A's and U56, U57, U36, U36A, U137
. The "U's" have never been recorded or photographed in this area before, so we actually got the first photos of them here as it was our Captain that found them! The other whales do not visit here very often so it was an amazing encounter to see all of them!! There was a minke whale in the area as well so we got to see the trifecta!...Janine Harles, Puget Sound Express

10/15 on the Chilkat Express!! Wow, what another amazing day! As if it wasn't already awesome enough that we saw
3 Humpback Whales at Possession Bank, "Two Spot"
showed us his fantastic lunge feeding technique, scattering a large bait ball! Our journey continued north where we found
at least 10 Transient Killer Whales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Not just any Ts, these are infrequent visitors to this area. My first time meeting the
T35s, T38As, U57, U58 and others(?)
. Thanks to all who helped us ID these new to us orcas! -Justine Buckmaster, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express
