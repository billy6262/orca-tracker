Sunday about
noon
we were taking a hike through
Pt Defiance and stopped at Dalco passage Viewpoint
"just in case" the juvenile
Humpback
was still hanging around and to our delight it was, with the same energy and delight it has been showing folks down near
Owen Beach, Vashon Island ferry dock and Dalco Passage
for the last 10 days. It has been a wonderful added treat to a glorious autumn. I have ventured down to the beach every 3rd day or so to check and it appears to have a similar pattern to the comment below on the gray whale near Olympia. 3-4 loud blows and then a deep dive, then we patiently wait for what seems forever before we hear and see the water spray again. I love this site which keeps us updated on when and where our magnificent creatures remind us of this big glorious world we live in. BTW on Friday, as we followed the travel of this Humpback from Owen Beach toward the Narrows Bridge, we came up on a huge pod of seals or sea lions below the cliffs. The water was so clear and you could see them playing under the water and enjoying the day. They were very close to shore about 20-30 of them. -Monia Janek Herlocker
