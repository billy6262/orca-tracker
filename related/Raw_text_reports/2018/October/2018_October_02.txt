Orca Sightings for October 2, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
5 Orcas Off Shore of Perego's Lagoon
: Hello, On Oct. 2nd, at about
11:50 am, we spotted 5 orcas while we were hiking the bluff above Perego's Lagoon just north of Ebey's Landing on the
west side of Whidbey Island
. They were close enough to shore to see with the naked eye from the high bluff, but far enough out that we needed to use our binoculars to see their markings well. They were heading south. One looked to be smaller than the others, but we are inexperienced whale spotters, so we're not sure if we judged size correctly. Thank you for the work you do. -Maria Mitchell
