Orca Sightings for October 31, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Alert Bay - Just as we were getting ready for Halloween, Tasli noticed some tail lobbing right in front of our place
up here in Alert Bay
! We walked outside the house and
T049C
started breaching right in front! We walked along the beach watching him cruise in and out of the kelp beds along the Cormorant Island shoreline. Happy Halloween!! -Gary Sutton

Entry 2:
15:35 -
Beth Swanson submitted this report:
2, possibly 3 orcas heading west spotted south of Anderson Island
. Just now. Crossed in front of the ferry. 1 male for sure. 1 or 2 females. Unable to ID as they were too far off in choppy water. Traveling fast.
*

3:04 -
They went into
Carr Inlet
and I lost sight of them. There were 4-6 I think, hard to count. One big male and then maybe 3-5 smaller fins.

2:38 south end fox island
headed toward McNeil! -Lissa Brod Anderson

from Anderson Island
, we briefly saw them close to Fox shore around

between Fox and McNeil toward Carr Inlet
. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

They
(orcas)
are foraging here (
south of Narrows
close to Kitsap side). No apparent direction of travel. -Karen Caldwell
*

11:59 -
the
orcas are south of the bridge
now - tail lobs. I think they may have been hunting. Mostly milling. But tending south currently...Definitely at least 6. One tiny one. Still trending south. (This video (not including in this report - alb) is from my phone, so poor quality, but I'm sharing it because I was capturing the orcas and the humpback together, so you can see how close they were. This was at
11:41 this morning. The orcas are to the right. When I panned to the left, the blow was from the humpback. Amazing morning!)

11:36- They (orcas) are milling under the bridge. 4 for sure
.

Entry 5:
*
We received a phone call around 11 a.m. about a possible humpback in distress across from Narrows Park. When Science Specialist Stena Troyer and Communications Specialist Carly Vester arrived, the
humpback
was okay and steadily moving through... and
a small pod of orcas
were coming in! The pod swam
under the Narrows bridge around
11:30 a.m
. and stayed in the area
until at least
12:15
p.m, potentially later. There were at least 6 orcas, including a juvenile who was splashing, flipping its tail, and at one point rolled in the water! Meanwhile, near-shore, several sea lions and harbor seals were staying safely away from the orcas. Check out the video in the comment section as well of the orcas passing by. Members of the
T46 matriline
southbound at Tacoma Narrows Bridge. What a Halloween treat! -Harbor Wildwatch

T46E & T46.

Entry 7:
*

11:25 - (Humpback
) He's moved south of the bridge & seems to be traveling & surfacing now.

10:44 - I thought the whale (Humpback) would have moved on by now but he is
still under the bridge
- very active. Lots of splashing, tail throws. Residents who live nearby say this behavior has been going on for 2 hours & are concerned- wondering if this is normal or if something might be wrong. -Heidi Armstrong
(
all was well with Vivaldi, there was some concern about the prolonged surface activity until it was sorted out there were orcas in the same area on a kill - alb
)
*

11:50 - Orcas hanging out just south of bridge. Humpback just north.

11:33 - Orcas now sighted under Narrows
. Humpback still here as well.
