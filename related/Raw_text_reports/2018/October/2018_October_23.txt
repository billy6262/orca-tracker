While at
Owen Beach
, spotted one
humpback
traveling back and forth across the
length of Vashon
, east/west. I was surprised that he changed direction so many times. He was mostly milling at the surface, but I saw the fluke and knew he was diving down a few times. He breached twice (once right in front of the Vashon ferry!), and a significant amount of tail slapping! He travelled over to the middle of Dalco Passage, still milling around. What a sweet sight to get to watch him for so long! -Erin McCoy
