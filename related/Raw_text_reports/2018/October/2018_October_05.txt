Orca Sightings for October 5, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Trip report - on this rainy day we headed west via the San Juan Islands, with no reports of whales at all, scanning for those familiar dorsal fins - and on a hunch Capt Eric headed towards East Point but before arriving there, we heard "WHALES!" on the radio. The
T49A family
was found heading towards
Flat-top Island, Gull Rock and onwards to Spieden Island
. Then came the
T65A group
and the two groups joined up on the north side of Spieden. What a treat to see these Biggs/Transient whale families - great viewing even with light rain falling. A fun day - well done Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

Entry 2:
10:44 - BCX1210 "Slate" feeding with another humpback on Possession Bank
