16:30 - There were at least two Humpbacks
(Together, at least at that moment. )
between Edmonds and Point No Point
this afternoon. One breached maybe half a dozen times and did some fin slapping. Within maybe 2-300 yards from what I could tell, although at that distance things get tricky. -Josh Adams

a humpback off the Kingston Edmonds
ferry this morning on the

Just saw a
humpback or grey breach three times on the east side of Blake Island!
Majesty! It was traveling northeast, away from Blake Island. I couldn't see the dorsal fins, just the underside as it was breaching. It must have been a gray as I didn't notice the pectoral fins. Thank you for the lesson! I remember the humpback breaches in Maui and their pectoral fins were very visible. Thanks again Alisa! I love you peeps! -Julie Aoki Nardi
