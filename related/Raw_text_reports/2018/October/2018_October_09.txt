Orca Sightings for October 9, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
a whale just off the west-facing shore of Harstine Island, in Pickering Passage, about halfway between Squaxin Island and the Harstine Island Bridge
. I first saw it right in front of my house Wednesday afternoon (10th), but my neighbor said he had seen it the day before (9th). The whale was still swimming in the water in front of my house when I left for work about

7:00 pm last night (Thursday - 11th)
. I do not see/hear him this morning (report sent Oct 12th). He was truly a magnificent sight. Although he/she never lept completely out of the water it would come to the surface and blow water about every 15 seconds 3 or 4 times and then dive for about 5 minutes before surfacing again. It seemed to go on all day and all night. I will never forget the distinctive sound of the blowing whale. I feel so lucky to have seen this. -Karen Jensen
