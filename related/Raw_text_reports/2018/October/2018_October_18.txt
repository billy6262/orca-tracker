???!!! There were Witnesses this time, too!my pictures were still crap, I was literally getting ready to leave and had to throw it back in park and jump out....Thank you for the clarification, they were definitely some small dolphins. I was just very excited, before this week I didn't know that we got humpbacks or dolphins over here. Never even seen a whale or dolphin in real life. The last 4 days have been very exciting for me. -Johnny Collard

There's something with a large dorsal fin swimming around, maybe 30 feet away over by Anthony's. Is there anyone that can attest, and maybe shed some light on what I saw? It popped out of the water twice, and it was a darker grey I believe. I wasn't able to get my phone out fast enough to get a decent picture. Just kind of a blur..Johnny Collard
