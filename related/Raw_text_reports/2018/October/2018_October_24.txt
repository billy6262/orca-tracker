Entry 3:
CS631/CRC16017 Two Spot
on Saratoga we were very happy to see the fog gone! It was cloudy and cold, but the whales didn't care. Especially not Two Spot! After lunging through a bait ball near
Possession Bank
, he turned north toward
Useless Bay
. After apparently eating a big breakfast, he came over to the boat for a bit of "mugging" with some enthusiastic rolls at the surface and some eye contact with the passengers and crew. After he had enough, he continued toward
Double Bluff
and we moved on to Eastern Bank, where we found lunge feeding Minke Whales! Of course, I can't forget the lovely Steller Sea Lions at Whale Rocks. Another wonderful day with the wildlife of the Salish Sea! -Justine Buckmaster
