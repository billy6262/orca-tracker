Now they
(humpbacks) are in Admiralty inlet between Skunk Bay and Useless Bay
. -Lora Davis

10/17 on Chilkat Express with our 3rd whale trifecta in a row!! We encountered
2 Humpback Whales
apparently having an intense social interaction
near Possession Bank
. It was
"Two Spot" in hot pursuit of "Zephyr"
who trumpeted loudly with every breath as the two sped toward the Kitsap Peninsula. Then, we found a
Minke Whale near Port Townsend
(not pictured) then spotted two more off in the distance from Eastern Bank. To top it off, we met up with
Gray Whale #185
feeding in shallow water near Mabana Beach on Camano Island. Beautiful weather, and lots of smaller critters as well, but I didn't manage to get any pictures of them. -Justine Buckmaster

10:18 -
We left them (
CS631/CRC16017 and MMZ0004
) heading quickly toward Eglon.
Zephyr was trumpeting as Two Spot
pursued her, both moving fast.

Point Defiance, Dalco Passage, Point Ruston, Vashon Island.
..one of the most beautiful fall days ever...I got to meet
Vivaldi (humpback)
for the first time. The fall colors were incredible!... I never thought the fog would ever lift but I think around 1 pm it finally did....it was cool, seeing sun rays coming thru and watching fishermen down at the boat house...anyway, my soul so so needed this....fog, boats and fisherman...hearing the kingfishers at pier and herons and other nature calls. Seals and sea lions out like crazy...water so -Marilyn Armbruster

, Camano Island. -Justine Buckmaster

My greyhounds and I sighted
a whale
this morning close to shore off
Bells Beach around 7am
. But we aren't sure what kind! It hardly surfaced unlike the the numerous gray whales that we saw this summer which would surface much sooner. But we were awed none the less to hear its powerful exhales. Very dark. Humpback? It was on its own. -Robin Reich
