Orca Sightings for October 11, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Stunning day in the
San Juans
today. Flat water, sun shining and hanging out with the
T090's, T087 and T002B

Entry 2:
Possession
, just 5 minutes off the dock with
2 humpback whales
! We didn't get any looks at flukes so no ID's. Then we headed up to the
San Juans where we found the T123's near Henry Island
. They have a new baby, also!
T123s with new calf T123D (R) first seen early October. Lovely big brother T123A (born 2000).
We were able to watch a scat sniffing dog being trained on a research boat, and then on the way home we encountered
2 minke whales near Port Townsend
! While watching the minkes, I saw a disturbance in the water, turns out it was a group of salmon that were porpoising through the water! -Janine Harles

Entry 3:
15:00 - Humpbacks lunge feeding at Race Rocks

Entry 4:
humpback whale off Bedwell Harbour
, South Pender Island at
1430
today. It was about 300 M off the shore. No pics of the tail; the sun was behind the whale. This whale seemed to be particularly large, compared to some others I have seen. The whale surfaced unexpectedly, quite close to us (less than 200M; no indication it was in the area as we had a couple kms of clear view). It took 3 breathes and then dove. It resurfaced off Gowland Point as it moved east along Boundary Pass. We were headed west. -Frank Gee, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve

Entry 5:
18:23 - Two humpbacks moving down San Juan Channel from Limestone Point
. -Alan Niles
*

Entry 6:
1 or 2 large whales in the ferry lanes on the the
5:30 run from Pt. Defiance to Vashon
. Too far to capture an image. Looking towards Vashon, just in front of the ferry slip I saw a single whale start a dive. About three minutes later looking towards the southern shore I spotted a large spout and a smaller one right afterwards, just to the west of the ferry lanes. The dorsal fins were small and the backs broad. Definitely not orcas. I did see the tail flukes but the distance was too great to note any details. (
unconfirmed but sounds like humpbacks - alb
). -Mitch Kent

09:50 - 2 humpbacks between Edmonds and Possession

Entry 7:
~

15:00 - One Gray feeding and heading north on Camano side just south of Mabana
. Watched for an hour...I am very lucky to have seen him. I was the only one around and I walked along the beach with him for about an hour. Here is a picture of the fluke and pec fin, but I don't think it will help with identifying markers. -Kerri Jones
