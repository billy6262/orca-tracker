Sat Oct 13 - Saratoga Passage, North Puget Sound - Thanks to sharp eyed, and eared, neighbors I just had a chance to see our overwintering?
gray whale
. Just south of
Mabana, Camano Island
, close to shore at
9 AM
high tide, heading south. Interestingly, I had noted a flock of Scoter feeding in front of the house yesterday and had thought it was strange they were there this time of year. They were acting just like earlier in the Spring when the the gray whale are feeding and they follow along for the feast. The neighbors say the whale has been around most of the week. -Barbara Brock

Two whales blowing between
Harstine Island and north end of Squaxin Island
- visible from Harstine Island Bridge. Too far away to see what kind of whales, but LOTS of bird activity circling above blows. It was blowing rapidly, so we assumed two. Could have just been a very active single whale. -Mia Bosetti
