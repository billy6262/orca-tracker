Sarah Schmidt and her COAST seabird survey team reported seeing

Trip Report: Another splendid, sunny day aboard Mystic Sea! After we cleared Guemas Channel, we headed north through the San Juan Islands, and happily caught up with the
T49As and T65As
(Transient aka Bigg's orcas) at the
north end of San Juan Island
. One group was fairly spread out, trending northwest and we stayed with them for awhile. We then visited with the second group, near Waldron Island. This group of
four, 2 large males and two smaller ones
, split to go
around Battleship Island
, then turned north in the sparkling sunshine.
The T49A group are T49A (matriarch, born 1986), son T46A1 (born 2001), T49A2 (born 2007), son T49A3 (born 2011), and T49A4 (born 2014). The T65A group (who we have been lucky to see a lot this season) are T65A (matriarch, born 1986), son T65A2 (born 2004), son T65A3 (born 2007), daughter T65A4 (born 2011), T65A5 (born 2014), and calf T65A5 (born
April 2018).
We then checked out the exotic deer and sheep on Spieden Island, and made our way back to Cap Sante marina. Such a privilege to see these magnificent orcas! It's been a wonderful season, with splendid weather (mostly!) and splendid whales. Thanks to Captains Monte and Eric and all the great crew members, and Amy Wood at the office, to all our wonderful passengers! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

COASTAL KILLER WHALES -

Entry 3:
October 2018 I was on a Pelagic Birding trip out of
Westport to Grays Canyon approx 35 miles out
. We came across a large flock of seabirds that was picking up the scraps from a
pod of Orcas. At least 5
in size. Mostly young and females. There may have been a young Male. Photographs were taken and if you check with Phil or Chris Anderson they may know the individuals you can contact to get the pictures. We had to have been amongst them for an hour at least. They were aggressively hunting and feeding. The Capt Phil says they rarely encounter Orcas on their trips and maybe once a season only do they see any. -Mark Girling
