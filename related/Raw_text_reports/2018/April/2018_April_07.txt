They were actively changing directions quite a bit (also on Mystic Sea this afternoon). They would go through periods of tail slapping, breaching, and spy-hopping and then be hard to find for a few minutes at a time. It was an amazing afternoon, though!

Mystic Sea left
J pod
still active off
Hidden Beach at around 1.00 pm
. When I left home this morning I expected to see transient orcas, not residents. I was as surprised as everybody else to discover that we were encountering Southern Resident orcas from
J pod in Saratoga Passage
today. I'm not even going to try and describe the indescribable - (actually I will) - spy-hops, breaches, tail slaps, side rolls, heads and tails, flukes and pecs, back rolls and more, every natural behavior seen in the wild that makes each encounter with these iconic whales so special. The lovely J38 powering along in Saratoga Passage! -Sandra Pollard

. Still going north fast. -Sharon Szekely Camano whale watch page
*

10:34 a.m - at least 3 possibly 5 orcas!
We saw some spy hopping and mostly just milling around. Large dorsal fin stayed above water for a little while. At least 1 large orca and 2 smaller ones. They hung around for about 30 minutes. Haven't seen them for at least 15 minutes and no indication of which way they were headed. They were closer to Camano side.

10:10 a.m - 3-5
, maybe more, orcas heading north in Saratoga.
1 mile south of Mabana
. -Jennifer Feldman Spanton
*

9:50 a.m -
This morning we had a very exciting view of a gray whale and one or two orcas. Regrettably, no photos that show more than a splash or a bump on the water surface. Directly off of the point at
Pebble Beach, Camano
, we looked up and saw the back third of a
gray whale's
body & fluke diving nearly vertically into the water. As we watched it move on to the northwest, we noticed an
orca dorsal fin
very close to the gray's back as it came up. Lots of splashing, fins in and out of the water, and moving quickly. We followed it with the binocs, and the splashing continued as they moved on, and an second orca dorsal came up. I hopped in the car and drove to Mabana, but they had already passed by traveling towards Camano Island State Park. -Peg Boley
*

9:30 a.m -
Lots of
killer whales together (more thatn 10, maybe 20?) off of beach at Pebble Beach Camano Island
. SW side of island. Feeding and traveling. -Sally Isaiou
*

8:51 a.m -
Now at north end of Hat between Hat and Camano. Neighbor Bruce Kolpack counted 10 dorsal fins.

8:36 a.m -
First group looked to be going toward north of Hat. We have another group passing right now. At least three in this group. Could one be a baby?

8:23 a.m -
They're here!
Between Hat and Whidbey
. Heading towards Langley. Moving quickly! We think
at least 5
.

7:23 a.m - Orcas
right now just
south of the Clinton Ferry
crossing. Appears to be a male and maybe two others, looked like females headed north. They are about a mile off the Clinton dock headed towards Hat Island/Saratoga Passage. I'm only seeing dorsal fins so it's hard to tell if it's a small female of possibly a young calf. -Melissa Simmons, WSF
*

7:17 AM -
Maia of WS Ferries relayed a report of
3-4 orcas 1000' north of the ferry Clinton/Mukilteo lane
. No direction.
*

Entry 4:
Penn Cove - North Puget Sounder #56.
- A beauty of a
gray whale
feeding in the shallows at
Monroe Landing
tonight. The wind and periodic raindrops made it feel brutally cold but seeing that beautiful face made it all worth it. -Photo by Rachel Haight,

Entry 5:
*

7:20 p.m. - Gray in Penn Cove
. Must be feeding. Watched it for an hour. Maybe 50 feet from shore. Saw blow, back, and twice its entire face. Monroe Landing public parking area
Gray still feeding as of
6:50
. So close to
Monroe Landing
Beach. We could hear the blow. -Geogg Kappes
*

5:30 p.m. - Gray whale
sighting; We saw a
single small gray whale off the north shore of Penn Cove
adjacent to
Monroe Landing
late afternoon traversing close to shore during low tide, perhaps feeding in the shallow near shore. -William Stelle
*
1756 - grey whale shrimping
, saw a dark black body after first blow, then soon after saw his whole back and no
dorsal. also he kept going back and forth across the sand flats. 1730 - just saw a gray right off
Monroe landing
boat ramp (Penn Cove). -Kit Rhodes

Entry 6:
5:45 p.m -
We saw
one gray whale
headed north in Saratoga Passage
between Langley and Camano Island
. We are currently looking for Js from Sandy Point...so far no relighting. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

1:13 p.m -
Yes, it was a
grey
, saw the tail when it dove and had huge spouts of water, he is headed north towards Everett/Hat area.

12:46 p.m. -
Just saw another whale at the
ferry crossing (Mukilteo/Clinton)
appears to be headed north. Only saw the whale spouting water, couldn't tell what kind of whale before it dove. I'd assume a grey but can't be positive. -Melissa Simmons, WSF
*

10:30 a.m - Gray whale
right off west side
Sandy Point
, Whidbey. -Christy Korrow
*

10:15 a.m - Grey whale
. I saw a whale in Meerkirk bay (a.k.a.
Dines Point
) about
10:15 AM this morning Saturday 7th April. The whale was on its own, moving west along the bay then turning north towards
Greenbank
and North Bluff. My attention was first drawn to the whale due to the noise it was making, rather like a roar. When I got to the shore line I saw the whale's head rising out of the water as it came up to breathe. The whale was in view for about 15 minutes as it headed north, rising to the surface to blow water from its blowhole then dropping below the surface. 48 4' 32"N, 122 33' 1"W. -Andrea Linton

7:10 p.m. -
on

Entry 7:
two gray whales
heading south in the Saratoga Passage from our home in
Greenbank
. They appeared to feeding, but too far away to really see. Event lasted about 15 minutes. Mostly we saw the spouting action as they came to surface, but one time, part of one whale came up out water - don't know if was its' head or tail. Best guess feeding & traveling. Middle Saratoga Passage - east of Hidden Beach. -Kathryn Daberko
