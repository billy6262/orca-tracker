Hi Alisa, Howie, and Susan, Here are some photos from
April 27 when we ventured down into
Hood Canal to find the T65A pod

T65A6
surfacing with mom during all the commotion. T65A and her new calf T65A6 in Dabob Bay, Hood Canal. -Bart Rulon, Chilkat Express.

Friday
April 27th report - nearing the end of our gray whale watch season, the whales will soon be heading north to their Alaskan feeding grounds. Today we found our iconic
Patch, #49, lazily feeding along the shallow banks SE of Hat/Gedney Island.
Then to the west of Hat/Gedney, Shackleton #21 and Earhart #22 were found. These two whales have been seen together frequently this season, will they also travel north together? -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

Catie Wire sent a video of a

Entry 8:
Owen Beach in Tacoma/Point Defiance
yesterday evening,
April 27th and saw
a whale
swim by under the water. She said it was moving fast and all the anglers are saying pilot whale. We don't have those in Puget sound do we? -Hope Anderson
