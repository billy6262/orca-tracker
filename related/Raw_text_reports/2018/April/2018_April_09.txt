Entry 8:
7:00 p.m.
- Mary Jo Adams is watching
a gray whale feeding in Crescent Harbor
, north of Oak Harbor. More later emailed with photos: Some folks who were out there watching this evening asked me if it was the same one that was there this morning so I guess there was one there then as well. It was feeding right in behind the boat ramps on the seaplane base. I did not see much of the tail flukes but have some pictures of the flipper that he was holding up in the air and more of the back area. Hope you can ID it! -Mary Jo Adams

does not match a known ID

About

6:00
this evening, three gray whales traveled down mid-passage
between Langley and Pebble Beach
, taking their time with shallow dives and lots of blows. Seeing two flukes at the same time was quite the thrill. They were traveling
towards Sandy Point
on Whidbey. -Peg Boley
*
Monday
April 9th - heading northbound on a truly beautiful sunny day, within minutes of leaving Langley we'd found
#49 Patch
heading to the shallower water along Whidbey's coastline. He showed off his beautiful fluke (tail) to us a few times, then we headed further north and found
THREE whales feeding
- hugging the shoreline, southbound. Fun to see their pectoral fin and half their tail as they scooped up the bottom sediment, finding ghost shrimp. These three were
ID'd as #21 Shackleton, #22 Earhart, and #383
(no name). The next whale we found was the new visitor,
CRC #185
, who was also feeding along the shoreline. We made it to Baby Island to see many California Sea Lions, and harbor seals and a few harbor porpoise, but wait -
another whale was in Holmes Harbor
! This was #531 (no name) and we had some great views of her in the mill-pond like conditions in Holmes Harbor. Wow - 6 whales, and sunshine. A great day on Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Entry 9:
*

1:00 p.m. -
Monday,
April 9th while sitting on deck facing the bay, heard
a sound that was associated the next day by seeing a blow
spout. The sound reminded me of blowing into a vacuum cleaner hose! No dorsal fin is seen and no breaching or tail fins seen. Tuesday it was moving north to south direction around midday, Wed. & Thurs. late afternoon it was moving south to north. It is solitary. The birds on the water appear like specks so I don't know how big the spout is but very visible. I saw one but my friend says she saw 2 spouts at same time. From
Harrington Road, Coupville
. -Irma Simons
