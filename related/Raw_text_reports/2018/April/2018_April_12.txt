Entry 4:
7:40 p.m.
- I just saw a small pod of
orca whales heading south down Puget Sound
, in front of our home at south end of Bainbridge at Restoration Point. I could see for sure
three adults and at least one if not two small whales
(based upon size of dorsal fin). Very exciting for me! They were just swimming along headed south. I saw them just passing Blakely Rock heading south (Blakely Rock is just north of the southern tip of Bainbridge, Restoration Point) It was very exciting to see them! -Thanks, Catherine

On a windy and rough weather day, we had a report of
Biggs/Transient orcas
close by ... so off we ploughed towards Mukilteo and were rewarded with some great windy views of the T65A family, with a new calf! Great excitement as we had many looks at the new calf, although hard to catch with a camera! So exciting to see orcas again in our area, they continued to
head south out of Possession Sound
. When returning to port we also found one of our
"Sounders", gray whale #531
, feeding along the shoreline by Sandy Point. An unexpected surprise seeing 2 types of whales today - thanks Captain Eric for the great day! New calf
T65A6
surfaces surrounded by her/his family in Possession/Puget Sound.
