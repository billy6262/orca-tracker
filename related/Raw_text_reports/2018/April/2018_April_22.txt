April 22 - A sunny Earth Day afternoon cruise today - as Mystic Sea hosted the annual Sound Water Stewards' gray whale cruise! Great food and great camaraderie - sun and whales - how much better could it be? We found
#22 Earhart and #53 Little Patch by Hat Island, then #531 north of Langley, and #383 along the Camano Shores
. One whale surfaced quite close to us, surprising us all, what a treat! Thank you Mystic Sea for a great day! -Jill Hein, Sound Water Steward, and volunteer Naturalist.

Whales inshore and offshore today, with our first encounter just five minutes after leaving Langley Marina. #531's heart-shaped blow was clear to see as she headed from the deeper water towards the beach for a tasty snack of ghost-shrimp. With a stiff breeze whipping up the whitecaps on a cobalt sea against the stunning background of the snow-capped Olympic mountains, passengers also enjoyed watching some of our favorite Sounders
#383 and #49 (Patch)
, intent on wasting no time in finding their next meal
close to Gedney (Hat) Island
. With so much evidence of whale feeding pits along the shoreline, hopefully the Sounders are well prepared for the next stage of their long migration north. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
