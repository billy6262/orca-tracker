Entry 8:

On yet another glorious clear, sunny day, Mystic Sea left the dock to head south towards
Everett where Sounders #49 (Patch) and #383
traveled in tandem, their heart-shaped blows silhouetted against the backdrop of the Cascade mountains. One of our crew members, Richard Snowberger, took to the skies earlier with pilot Fred Lundahl for some aerial photography of whale feeding pits around Whidbey, always a fascinating sight. Later on our trip we found two gray whales feeding in Port Susan, displaying the skill they have achieved in perfecting this high-risk feeding strategy so close to shore.
