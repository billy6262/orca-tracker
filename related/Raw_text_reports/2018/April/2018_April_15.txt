Having a bite with Marilyn Armbruster at

when they rang their whale bell. Everyone in the place moved over to the windows to see at least
one gray whale
feeding very close in shore off downtown
Langley
! We downed some of our food & drink, packed the rest to go and hauled our butts down the stairs at Boy and Dog park to catch up with
PCFG #185
who was moving steadily along Seawall Park eastbound feeding along his way just from shore! The park ends so we watched him continued on, we then moved east and tried to relocate him. Last sighting was off the tug parked at the Langley Marina somewhere around

Entry 6:
4:00 p.m. -
We made it just in time to
Fox Spit to see Grays 21, 22, & 383
now on the southside tip of East Point rustling around in the shallows together feeding on ghost shrimp buried in the sand. Barely had time to get out of the car and run to sit seaside just feet from these beautiful giants. They spent the next 20 minutes moving south along the shore, their bodies writhing, pec and flukes rising as they lay on their sides digging up shrimp. They continued along the shores towards Bells Beach. A most wonderful intimate encounter shared with many on shore. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Mystic Sea hosted a fundraising cruise for Orca Network on Sunday afternoon. An unexpected treat was having John Calambokidis from Cascadia Research Collective speak to our passengers prior to departure, with great updates on our local "Sounders" gray whale population. We headed north from Langley and were treated to
3 whales feeding along the shoreline of Whidbey Island. #21 Shackleton, #22 Earhart and #383 (no name)
. It's a privilege to see this amazing feeding behavior - showing a pectoral fin and half of their fluke (tail) as they feed on their side in the shallow water. It's unknown where else this feeding behavior has been seen. We also found another whale by Mabana on Camano Island (#531), also feeding along the shore. Thank you Mystic Sea for the great day, and providing good weather! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

(
ID notes by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Reserach : "Kim sent me her pictures, and that is
Stump
, one of the bottlenose dolphins that we have identified. The way her dorsal fin bends to the right gives the leading edge of the fin the appearance of a bit of a bump when viewed from the side."
