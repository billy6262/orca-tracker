We saw and videos a small
4 orca pod in the Lower Canal of Hood Canal at Skokomish
yesterday (
April 25). Looked like a male, female, younger one and a baby. (very cute by the way!!) We would be happy to send these to you if you would like. It would be great to learn more about them. We were so surprised too see them as they don't normally come down this far! -Thank you for your time, Melissa Donovan
