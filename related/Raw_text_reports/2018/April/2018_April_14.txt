Penn Cove
!

4:20 p.m. - The two grays just passed Riepman Ave heading west deeper into Cove
very close to shore! In heavy heavy rain squall!

4:00 pm. - There are 3 whales in Penn Cove. 2 west of Monroe's Landing and east of Riepman Ave. Out of public view on this the north side.
Third whale
is out mid channel somewhere in this same general area. Rain squall came in making for unpleasant viewing.

These

then moved offshore and to the north. Currently mid channel between Hidden Beach, WI and Cama Beach, Camano

1:12 p.m. -
At least
21, 22, 383 of the 4 grays
Renee reported have moved in closer to
Hidden Beach
in Saratoga Passage, currently paralleling shoreline several hundred yards offshore heading northbound. Cascadia is just now with these whales. (531 may have headed over towards Holmes Harbor). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
Today was Welcome the Whales day in Langley - and we did it in style. After leaving the dock Mystic Sea headed
north in Saratoga Passage
where
Sounders #21, #22, #383 and #531
were intermittently resting and feeding between Hidden Beach and Camano Island. New research is finding that, although gray whales are not a pod animal, they seem to be associating more together while spending their annual sojourn in Puget Sound away from the main migration. Judging from the large number of scoters near Baby Island competing with some playful California sea lions, there must be plenty of good food around. As the colorful parade arrived at Whale Bell park and the blessing of the whales ceremony took place, their blows could be seen not too far away. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

11:13 a.m. -
