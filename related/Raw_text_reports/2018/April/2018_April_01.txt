Orca Sightings for April 1, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's been quite a 24 hours on the
hydrophones
! Yesterday a sperm whale, and today the
T2Cs
who were chatty for well over an hour in
Haro Strait
. Today was also the first official day of our fourth field season and we were lucky enough to see the T2Cs early in the day and then have an extended acoustic encounter with them in the afternoon. Here's a CLIP of what we heard. -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 4:
*
April 1 - April Fool's Day? Not for passengers and crew on Mystic Sea, who soon caught up with Sounder
#383 and his companion 531 traveling in tandem near Hat (Gedney) Island
. Despite chilly, choppy conditions hardy sailors kept track of the whales while enjoying a mix of sea spray and whale breath blowing on the wind, before bidding the duo farewell and heading north in Saratoga Passage to catch up with a raft of barking, frolicking California sea-lions near Baby Island. No Easter bunnies on this trip, but half-a-dozen Bald Eagles dueling above the treetops waited to greet us on our return to the port of Langley on yet another adventure filled day. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
