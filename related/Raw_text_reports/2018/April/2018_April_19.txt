Bigg's killer whales -
Hood Canal -
7:44 p.m. - saw them (orcas)
20 minutes ago headed north from
Hoodsport to Sund rock
. Mid channel. Then we lost sight. -Brad Lambert

1:51 p.m - (orcas) Right off Eldon
! Appears to be feeding. No direction of travel either. -Nick and Amy Eberling
*
Just got back from the
Hama Hama
Shellfish Company. Spent an hour, (
12 -
1:00
, Low tide was at 12'ish), watching
orcas
just North of the delta. I would guess they were feeding as they weren't moving in either directions. -Harry Louch

I am seeing about
3 orcas
on east side of Hood Canal out from
Hamma Hamma River

Entry 2:
Dalco Passage
/Puget Sound -

9:51 a.m - Three orcas seen in Pt Defiance Vashon ferry lanes
. Heading towards Gig Harbor shoreline on Vashon side then we lost sight of them. Like they went down for a feed. They were thrashing about. We think they looked like 3 males. Tall dorsals. -Amy Christensen-Burrows

Entry 3:
Female gray whale 531
feeding close in shore off
Fox Spit
today in the presence of a local human resident. The gray whale close encounters afforded around the shores of Whidbey Island have been stunning and has connected neighbors and community to each other as well as the whales in such meaningful ways. -Photo by Allie Hudec,

Entry 5:
12:25 p.m. -
Just saw
a single Gray surfacing in Case Inlet at Vaughn Bay
. Headed around Rocky Point toward Allyn...
Only saw the one
, breached (surfaced) three times total before it disappeared around Rocky Bay Point. No photos or videos sorry. The whale was close to shore, headed North when it came up. Heard the whale blow first and looked to find it already submerged again except the back near the tail which never came out of the water. It was gray, white, and spotted with markings that look like circles. Quite symmetrical and white shaped marks all along both top sides. Hope this helps. -Janie Zumstein Powell

Entry 6:
a gray whale swimming oddly in Crescent Harbor
off Whidbey Island Naval Air Station at

3:30
this afternoon (Thursday)...We didn't get photos since it didn't surface very much or for very long. (we asked for more details): It was swimming in small circles in water that was probably 6-8 ft. deep. From your description it could have been feeding. When it surfaced, it sometimes looked like it was on its side, other times it looked like it was swimming normally with its back on the surface. A few times we saw its side fins slapping the water. Hopefully it was just feeding, but we heard about a missing whale tangled in fishing gear. We have never seen a gray whale in Crescent Harbor before, especially so close to shore in the shallow water. (I would say it is a feeding gray whale - and Crescent Harbor happens to be one of the places our grays feed, more than usual this year though.- SB) -Tom Lowman

Entry 8:
*

7:30 a.m - Gray whale
feeding at
Bells Beach for over 30 min
. This one fed by swimming back and forth, opening his mouth and slowly collecting what I assume was shrimp for 30 minutes. Neighbors collected on the bank, with cups of coffee, dogs on leashes and binoculars in hand. We love welcoming the whales, and they bring us together! -Peggy Sullivan
