2:15 p.m -
We saw them as we were headed south out of
Hoodsport
! They we're headed North. I saw the blow hole, then it rolled and flipped it's tail up. We were driving so couldn't see everything closely. I feel like we just spotted the baby, because we were debating if it was a Dall's Porpoise or Orca (but we've never seen a porpoise flip it's tail out of the water). WOW!!! So happy that this thread confirmed that we saw an Orca in the Hood Canal. I always tell my kids we won't see them that far south, and now we have! -Sara Kaugman-Bradstreet

12:43 p.m. -
Yep, saw them go in
Dewatto
from a viewpoint on the 101. -Keith Dixon

Found them around

11:00ish north of Ayock
. Saw the Chilkat, so thought it would be a good place to start. SAW THE BABY!!, although from a distance! Followed them to Eagle Creek Tavern, (large hamburger on their roof), where it appears they made a kill, (on the east side of the canal), as seagulls came in. When I left them, (

12:10
), they were
heading south again
. Tide still going out. -Harry Louch

2 common or bottlenose dolphins
close to the lighthouse at
Point-No-Point (Kitsap)
this evening, while watching a pod of harbor porpoise mid sound. The dolphins did a slow breathing roll and then were gone. They were close to shore. Too fast for a photo. It was a thrill! -Jim Larkin
