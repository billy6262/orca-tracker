Orca Sightings for April 16, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hidden Beach/Saratoga Passage -

5:25 p.m. -
8:15 p.m. Arrived to Hidden Beach
, Whidbey at
5:25 and
3-4 grays were feeding
close in shore slowly making their way south along the shoreline swimming all over each other stirring up the water as they fed on ghost shrimp in the sand. Around
6:00pm they suddenly took off at high rate of speed where we thought we were saying goodbye, then just as quickly circled back slowed their pace and headed back down to the deepest end of the the bay. At this point there were only 3, so we either were incorrect or one continued south as
21, 22, & 383
circled back. The spent the next 3 hours feeding along the shore moving through the bay at Hidden Beach, circling back wide then moving in again. They repeated this many times. We left them at near dark now in glassy calm waters under a moody dark sky. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
