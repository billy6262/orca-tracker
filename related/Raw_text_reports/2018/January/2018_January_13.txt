Orca Sightings for January 13, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Molly's first orca encounter! Members of the
T90s & T100s passing under the iconic Space Needle
on their way out of
Elliot bay
after traveling inbound along the downtown Seattle waterfront and exiting closer to the West Seattle side where Molly and many of us stood in awe. Stunning visit by these beauties on this unusually warm, sunny, gorgeous winter day. -Photo by Molly Magnifico,

Entry 2:
Elliott Bay, Puget Sound - At about
3:30 saw what looked like a male, female and baby
(our very uneducated guesses) in the channel off of Rolling Bay Walk on Bainbridge heading north. -Diane Van Summern Bachen
*

2:35 p.m. -
Jeff Hogan called...They've U-turned and now heading
NW out of Elliot Bay toward Bainbridge Is. 7 whales total
.
*

2:30 p.m. -
they have turned north. Appear to be
continuing northbound
with some directional changes...now trending NW bound. Just on outer edge of the bay. (I turned my attention to other matters...glancing up periodically. They appeared to still be in the general area as
2:30 update and trending NW)

2:20 p.m.
- they have continued NWerly, south of ferry lanes heading directionally towards
Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island
, but are now just exiting edge of Elliot Bay. Away from Alki.
T90s & T100s in Elliott Bay
! Entered closer to Magnolia, paralleled downtown Seattle waterfront, continued deep into the bay, flipped then headed back out closer to West Seattle side. Mid way you will find orcas under the Space Needle and a bit later close-ups as they depart the bay grouped up. Exiting Elliot Bay: T100, T90, and maybe T90C. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

2:10 p.m. -
So beautiful. In placid calm waters, they began their travels
out of Elliott Bay
, primarily in two groups separated by a short distance. Once under the Space Needle (sightline)
T100C
circled around, he then headed towards the others a up ahead. As they were all coming together they made an adjustment and aimed towards those of us lining the shores along Duwamish Head, West Seattle. One spy-hopped. Once grouped they continued westerly heading
out of Elliot Bay, much closer to West Seatle side
. A stunning pass in golden sunlight. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

2:00 p.m. -
Interesting to see many sea lions seek safety on a barge while
transients were in Elliott Bay
today. -Photo by Robin Sinner,

Entry 5:
*

1:54 p.m. -
they went deep towards
Harbor Island
and have now flipped heading back out (but are still between
Alki
boat launch and downtown) grouped up.

1:40 p.m. - They are downtown
! So lovely backdropped by skyline. Parallelling waterfront heading towards Ferris wheel. Loosely grouped. Transients. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

1:45 p.m. -
Jeff Hogan reports the orcas are within
1/2 mile of the Coleman ferry docks
, headed toward the stadium.
*

1:23 p.m. - Orca sighting near Seattle ferry harbor
. While traveling on the ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge, I saw
about 6 orca
, seemingly traveling in pairs going southward off the right side of the ferry. -Photo by Bianca Frogner,

1:20 p.m. -
still heading towards downtown. They paralleled
Elliott Bay Marina
, Magnolia and are east of the marina now and north of the ferry lanes.

1:10 p.m. - Now heading east into Elliot Bay
.

1:00 p.m. -
I first spotted them (a male and female) skirting edge of
Elliot Bay
making directional changes. Closer to Magnolia under the bluff between West Point and the Marina to the east. From Luna/Anchor park, West Seattle. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
We saw about
7-8 orca 1230 -1 pm out between West Point and Elliot Bay Marina
. One spy hoped twice. -Will Snugg
*

12:16 p.m. -
watching lots of birds swarming and seeing several whales, some tails south of
West Point buoy
. Can't get an accurate count or picture from this distance. Seems to be slowly drifting southward. -Rebecca Sherwood
*

12:00 Noon - 5 orcas (1 male) just south of West Point Lighthouse
, heading south. They stayed in the area for about 15 minutes before moving south. -Rodney Brown
*

9:00 a.m. - 5 or 6 orca
, at least 1 male and 1 or 2 babies spotted from the
850 Edmonds/ Kingston ferry
. Milling around, not going anywhere fast. We were lucky enough to see one good breach unfortunately I didn't get it on film. When we first spotted them they were closer to the Kingston side just north of the ferry lane, as we got closer they were probably 200 or 300 yards from the ferry. When we last saw them they were closer to the Edmonds shore....I'd say south bound. From the pictures I got looks like closed saddle patches, but I'll look at the photos on my computer when I get home. -Terri Barnett
