Orca Sightings for January 3, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait - First Encounter of 2018! Transients in Haro Strait....At
1312
, "Morning Star" found the
T100s, T124As, and T124C traveling quickly east a mile east of Trial Island
. As the whales porpoised past Discovery Island in rough seas, the T100s and T124As split up and regrouped multiple times. Most of the time, T124C trailed behind the group(s) by a few hundred yards but on occasion would join up with T100C or with the group(s)...For full summary report w/photos see Center for Whale Research Encounter 1.

After coming north up
mid-Haro as far as Lime Kiln, the T100s, T124As, and T124C
flipped south. They aimed in towards shore and at
15:40 were southbound at Pile Point. -Monika Wieland Shields
