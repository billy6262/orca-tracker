Orca Sightings for January 21, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whale sighting (I believe humpback) @ 1250 today at North Beach about 3/4 of a mile west of Deception Pass bridge
. Surfaced 3 times. Last time we saw it, it seemed to be heading west in between Deception Island and North Beach. it was pretty close to the cliffs on the beach. We were at the State Park amphitheater entrance, just on the beach and it was right there. -Briana Boese
