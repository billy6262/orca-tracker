Orca Sightings for January 27, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Northern Residents - (Email received
February 6th regarding the
January 27th encounter with the
A42s
as documented in our
January 28th Whale Report.)
Orcas, at least 5, in Sechelt Inlet
. A pod of orcas have made their way up the coast, spotted last week rubbing themselves on the smooth rocks on a beach located in the Georgia Straight. We're a small BC town and orcas have been known to pop by every few years, and we're lucky enough again to have them in our small coastal inlet again. From what I can tell from my on shore sighting and also videos posted online, the pod is at least 5 including two youngsters. At the time of initial spotting they were breaching. Which of course was a huge surprise. Only one boat went out to go and see them, and the whales were quite curious and intrigued, swimming around and underneath the hull. -Sacha Kalman

Northern Residents, the A42s beach-rubbing.
An amazing right-time right-place encounter for the many humans who stand in witness as this family of orcas engage in this cultural activity just feet from shore at Golden Mile Beach, Sechelt, BC. -Video by Bruce Robinson,

Entry 2:
(
ID by Jackie Hildering, The Marine Detective, BC researcher & educator. See below.
)
Jackie Hildering provided IDs and information on the rubbing which she included with a post on her Marine Detective page with someone else's video of the same encounter: "There they go again - the
A42s beach-rubbing
and it creating a great deal of excitement (and misinterpretation) amongst a lot of we humans. The same happened almost two years ago to the day when a video of them also went viral. "Beach rubbing" is a social behaviour specific to the culture of the "Northern Resident" population (and a few families in Alaska). Not a rare behaviour at all. It's rare that we humans get to see it. Led to my being interviewed by the BBC, etc. due to my IDing the whales and discussing the behaviour in THIS BLOG:"

Entry 4:
off south Kellett Bluff
and about mid-strait when "Orcinus" arrived on scene at about
1630
. "Peregrine" reported finding another group on their way south that they believed to be the T18s after their original group headed off in the direction of Halibut Island. Dave was just arriving on scene and saw a straight-finned male spread out from another couple of other whales heading north when a large group of females, juveniles, and a sprouter appeared in a tight ball much closer. This was "Peregrine's" original group and it included the
T100s, including the T100Bs, and the T124As minus the T124A2s.

Entry 5:
10:00 a.m - Reported as probable gray whale (later corrected to uncertain) in Gig Harbor
by John Dean, who says a very big whale with a fluke at least 8 -10' across. After more discussion with John: the whale was in
Hales Passage, between Wolchott Bay and Point Fosdick
close to shore heading eastbound towards Tacoma Narrows. Only the fluke was seen, he is not sure what type of whale. By description of the tail and that it presented it's fluke this sounds to be either a humpback or a gray whale.
