Orca Sightings for January 14, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J27
was foraging in the tide rips off the point and was engaged in at least one fish chase. He was staying down a long time and was surfacing irregularly so he was hard to get a photo of. There was a juvenile foraging in the same general area that
may have been J45
but he was even harder to keep track of and disappeared un-photographed. There were no other whales in sight. Around 1015, J27 looked finally committed to heading northeast up Boundary Pass which was fortunate as there was a big fog bank in Swanson Channel. Another bull finally appeared almost a mile west of J27 and this turned out to be
L87
