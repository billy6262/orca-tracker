a couple of whales heading west through the Pass around 4 pm

Entry 3:
transient killer whales complete with three new calves
. We found the
T49As (including T49A2, but with T49A1 still off galavanting around), the T75Bs, and the T75Cs just as the sunset with the Olympic rising in the distance. T49As, T75Bs, and T75Cs (cool so be able to say it's the 75Cs, plural!)
. They were found at
Reuben Tarte and we left them at sunset in Griffin Bay
, out from Jakles still heading down towards Cattle, but deep in the bay. The three new babies were all present and looked good. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Entry 4:
Eagle Pt on San Juan Island
. We stepped outside not long after midnight to see if we could hear the fireworks that we were watching across the straight. Yes, we heard fireworks, but we also
heard whales breathing
. They had just come around Eagle Pt, heading north. Not far off shore, we could
see dorsal fins in the light of the full moon. Probably 4-5 orcas
, could not tell gender. They passed by in about 5-7 minutes. Happy New Year! -Lynn Dietz with Grant & Megan Marshall
