Orca Sightings for January 7, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Harbor Porpoise -
Probably 50 Harbor Porpoises off Sunnyside beach in Steilacoom
. Lots of jumping and milling. Very active! All spread out. But generally towards Chambers Bay. I can see some at Anderson, some at Mcneill and some at Chambers now. -Paul Allen

Sea Otters -

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound -
11:00 a.m. - there were TWO SEA otters
heading south east into
Eld Inlet
and toward the tip of Cooper Point. Traveling and on a mission. Sneaky and fast. -Kim Merriman
