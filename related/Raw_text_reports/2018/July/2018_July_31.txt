Orca Sightings for July 31, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Yesterday (
July 31),
J-Pod was joined by a large portion of L-Pod in the Salish Sea
. We saw them as they headed north past
Lime Kiln
in the late afternoon.
J47 Notch
, pictured here, has, when we have seen him, been going back and forth between his grieving mother
J35 Tahlequah
and hanging out with some other young males in J-Pod. Yesterday he was in with
J38 Cookie and L105 Fluke
, among others. J50 Scarlet was present also. (The
August 1 update is
J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter
, for nine days now. It's difficult to imagine what she has been going through or the effort required to carry her baby hundreds of miles. We hope she finds the right time to let go, and that the body of her newborn returns peacefully to the sea. We are all struggling alongside her as we watch from afar, with a renewed fire to do whatever we can on behalf of the Southern Residents.) -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI

Per my friend Ariel Yseth at Land Bank,
L Pod is at San Juan County Park
, id'd as
Mega, Spirit, Solstice and 7-8 others
. Moving Slowly- fishing. I've been listening to them on Lime Kiln Hydrophone for about 10-15 minutes. General direction southbound....They came in very close to shore at Land Bank,. kelped, and
departed SB at
22:00
per Ariel. -Donna Van Renselaar

17:30 - Members of J-Pod
(plus some others - at least the
L72s
were present!) passed Lime Kiln going north.
J35 and J50
were both there, as was we believe all of J-Pod. -Monika Wieland Shields

They (
residents
) are now just
north of Eagle Point
. Going north. I can see a few at
Pile Point
as well. -Chris Wilson

15:15 -
There are whales offshore of
South Beach
heading north towards San Juan Island - reportedly
J-Pod and the L12 sub-group
. -Monika Wieland Shields

July 31st trip report - on a very foggy morning we headed towards and navigated through the San Juan Islands to Cattle Pass, checking on harbor seals and Steller sea lions on the way. The fog lifted and we continued south, where whales had been found near
Hein Bank
, and we were able to view
members of JPod (J16s)
as they foraged, and a little further south - LPOD! The
L12 grouping
was identified, we could see a lot of whales in the distance. Our closest viewing was of
L85 Mystery and L22 Spirit
, what a great surprise to find LPod today. Thanks Capt. Eric for a great day, returning to port in beautiful sunshine! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Entry 2:
Secret Cove, BC
(north of Sechelt). We were staying at a place called Sunset cove and we watched these
Orcas play or feed for over two hours at 8.30 in the morning
on the 31st July. There were possibly 4 or 5 in the pod, possibly transients as they seemed to be following the seals into the cove.. After 2 hours they moved off in a southerly direction. Would love to ID these guys? -Louise Carter
