Entry 2:
Lone orca lingering near Vancouver Island marina
has DFO concerned
*

Entry 3:
5:24 p.m - Just saw 3
what I'm assuming transient orcas off
Spring Beach
on Gabriola island...about 5 whale watching boats then 5 motor boats following them. We thought they would for sure turn around cause it's so narrow but we saw all the boats speed back past us so they must have made it through (between
Mudge and Gabriola
heading Northbound). -Emily Green
*
Bigg's T46s, T122, T137s
- Puget Sound -

Entry 4:
8:28 p.m -
Orcas still heading north. Closer to the center of the channel, at
Fort Casey
! -Brittney Herndon

Not quite Saturday night sunset whales, but not too far off. The
T137 and T46 transient orca pods passing Lagoon Point
as they exit Admiralty Inlet on a stunning summer evening. We are fortunate to have these whales in our midst at a time of seemingly insurmountable odds facing the future of the iconic Southern Residents. Many of us are having to compartmentalize our reactions to the pleasure of watching whales in the wild, mentally separating the two eco-types to deal with conflicting emotions; it has become almost too overwhelming to see the beleaguered Southern Residents at all, knowing of their precarious struggle to survive and the ineptitude displayed by agencies and government in taking the necessary steps to save them. -Sandra Pollard
