Entry 3:
T34s, T37, and T37Bs just went west through Spieden Channel
, and when they did so it was a breach fest unlike we have ever seen among transients! They were just in travel mode until erupting into breach after breach, plus cartwheels and tail slaps, for a period of a few minutes. Super fun to see! A full-out belly flop by
T37B
this afternoon in Spieden Channel. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

7/22 Trip Report: Another glorious day on the Salish Sea! We left Cap Sante marina with reports of orcas by Sucia Island, well within our range. We took the route on the north side of Guemes Island, passing by steep forested cliffs and beautiful rocky islands. The first stop was at Puffin Island to see some harbor seals and their pups and some sea birds, then continued north. We first caught up with magnificent big
Transient (meat-eating) male T73B
, with his unique dorsal fin. He was doing big circles around us, so kept us on our toes guessing where he would surface next! We then went a bit south to Jones Island to see
a group of five Ts (
T34s, T37, and T37Bs - alb
)
As they moved towards San Juan Island, we waited for them to resurface, which they did, behind us! They zig zagged around through the calm water.

, now separated from the families (

) he had been traveling with much of the month who were to the south and moving west. -Photo by Bonnie Gretz,

Entry 8:
sounds like
humpback
- alb
) - Saw a single whale...tail fluke only...off of
Browns Point Lighthouse
going southbound. Only saw once & then it dove. Unknown if a
gray or humpback
. Was seen at approximately

1:45 pm.
Appeared to be traveling and by itself. Saw no other whales. Stayed in area for about 30 minutes...Appeared to be a lone traveler. Saw wake from surfacing and then a few yards away from that spot it's tail fluke. After that I'd didn't resurface anywhere in the immediate area that we could see. Waited around for about 30 minutes but no other sightings. LeeAnn Cummins

southern tip of Vashon

ID notes from Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "This one is not quite clear enough to say for certain that it is
