Orca Sightings for July 27, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Trip report - it was another beautiful sunny day as we headed towards San Juan Island, with r
eports of Resident whales again; the
J17s,
the family of 6 whales who recently lost a newborn calf, were
meandering southward along the west side
. We gave them a LOT of space, so photos are very distant. Several research boats were checking on them, let's hope they're finding plenty of salmon. After a short visit with those Endangered whales, we headed towards Deception Pass to see a juvenile humpback whale, appearing to find food in the very strong incoming tidal currents just east of the Deception Pass Bridge, quite a sight! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
