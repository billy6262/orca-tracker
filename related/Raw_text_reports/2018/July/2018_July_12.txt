Orca Sightings for July 12, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
They're back! After another nearly two week absence, some of the
Southern Residents returned to inland waters this morning. J-Pod brought K-Pod with them
, the first visit for Ks since March. This photo (see below) is of
J16 Slick and J42 Echo off the west side
of San Juan Island this morning. J50 Scarlet WAS there too, but sadly she still did not look very good....At sunset
J16s, J17s, K12s, K16s, and K21
were spread on the west side from Hannah Heights to Salmon Bank.
Rest of Js and K13s and K14s were northbound
into the Strait of Georgia. -Monika Wieland Shields

We got to see the
J11's, J14's, J19's, J22's, K13's, K14's and L87 race through Cattle Pass
on the strong flood current all the way
up San Juan Channel
passing Friday Harbor. We heard they were at Patos Island heading NNW late in the evening. We included some of our photos. It was a beautiful experience watching these orcas. -Cheers, Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

Look who we got to hang out with today: These are
Southern Residents, L87 Onyx and K16 Opus with her son K35 Sonata
. "Resident" is a misnomer these days as they really are no longer here for the majority of the year feasting on salmon. Why? It's simple (well not really). Their main prey source is chinook/king salmon which has been in decline for quite some time and showing no signs of stopping. These are PNW icons and what whale watching is based on here. Only....that base is disappearing due to lack of food. So, when we make a big deal about seeing them it really is a BIG DEAL because they are starving and they have been spending a lot of time elsewhere. When they ARE here, there is no telling how long they will stay. Worse yet, where are they when they are not here, in their historic summer hangout? Its anyone's guess, most of the time. -Renee Beitzel

Dolphins -

Entry 4:
"Stump" the bottlenose dolphin has been in Budd and Eld inlets
the last three days - yesterday morning having been deep into the southern end of Budd near the port. These two images are of her yesterday 7/11/18 right off my bank. The first one is when she was heading south into Eld (

2:15
) and the other one when she had turned around and headed north (
2:45) toward Hunter Point. She was very near shore, super fast, and with robust blows. Dave Anderson and Cascadia Research Collective have confirmed her I.D. -Kim Merriman
