Orca Sightings for July 6, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - We've gone another week without Southern Residents in inland waters, but we've heard reports over the last three days that
all three pods (or at least members of Js, Ks, and Ls) have been actively foraging in the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Here's hoping they're finding a lot to eat, and that some of those fish start making their way to the Fraser with the whales behind them! -Monika Wieland Shields
*
Bigg's killer whales
-

Entry 2:
8:45 this morning
we saw a
small pod of Orca
(at least one adult and two calves/juveniles, no adult males) on the North side of
Navy Channel by Henderson Hill (in Mayne Island)
, Traveling east. Playing, traveling. No photos, have not seen whales in this area before. Yay! Rare to see in Navy Channel! -Katherine Littlefield
(
The
T124As
were picked up in
Plumper Sound at
10:45
so that was likely them - cool! - Monka Wieland Shields
)

Entry 3:
12:25 p.m. -
just northwest of Montague Harbor, mid channel in
Trincomali Channel
, we saw 4-5 blows and a fluke. It was too far to tell if it was one or two, or what kind. (
2 humpbacks were in Trincomali -alb
) Lori Patch

Entry 4:
4:00 p.m. - Gray Whale Sightings / Utsalady Bay, Camano Island
(48.269428, -122.477549 +/-) :
2 Gray whales
, traveling: NW, W, however they stayed in this vicinity for quite some time feeding. I assume they were feeding on the bottom; crab/shrimp, repeatedly coming to the surface and spouting. This is the first time I have seen Gray's in July. -Phil Kezele
*
Unidentified whales -

Entry 5:
12:25 p.m. -
just northwest of
Montague Harbor, mid channel in Trincomali Channel, we saw 4-5 blows
and a fluke. It was too far to tell if it was one or two, or what kind. -Lori Patch
*

Entry 6:
Holmes Harbor north of Beverly Beach
then off of Dines Point - never close enough to confirm a Humpback but that was my assumption - so amazing to see in Holmes Harbor. (Another strong possibility is one of the gray whales who are still residing in north Puget Sound -alb). -Anne Cushing
*
Unidentified cetaceans -

Entry 7:
8:00 p.m. - Orca sighting Tacoma Narrows
...It's possible that they were dolphins, unfortunately I was not able to get any pictures. They were circling not traveling in any one direction. -Robert Wormley
