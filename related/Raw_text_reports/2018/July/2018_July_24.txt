Orca Sightings for July 24, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received reports of
residents on the westside of San Juan Island and inbound from the Strait of Juan de Fuca
in the morning. Mark Malleson reported that the inbound whales were the
J17s
, and that they may have a new calf traveling with them. ...We found
J35 and J47
traveling several hundred yards behind the rest of the group, with
J35
surfacing in an unorthodox manner. After a few surfacings, it became clear that she was carrying something on her rostrum. After several more surfacings, we confirmed that
it was a deceased neonate
,..-See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 52.

An amazing day on the water yesterday (24th) with
both Biggs and resident killer whales
. On our way back from a couple of humpbacks, we saw
J's and K's
coming up from
Turn Point
. We shut down and just waited until everyone cleared and at one point,
J41 and J51
broke off from the group and swam over towards the boat and swam along side us before spyhopping in front of us. One of those magical resident moments that was overshadowed by the loss of J35's newborn. This population just can't catch a break. J27 Blackberry. J41 Eclipse. -Gary Sutton
*

3:39 p.m - two males and around 5-7 females
. Unfortunately they were slightly past when I got there, so I didn't get a lot of viewing time, but I definitely did not see
K21
. However I absolutely can NOT get an ID on one of the males I saw, small finger in the saddle, dorsal is mostly grown but still very very slightly back. Can't find him in my guide or app. However the photos are not the best since I've only got a little 300mm. -Cassie Barclasy
*

2:57 p.m. -
It looked like the rest continued north - ...it was about half a dozen that went south? Looked like
K21 and the K16s
and then maybe another trio with a youngster. -Monika
*

2:29 p.m. -
Has anyone seen any more heading south past
Lime Kiln
? I'm with that group that passed south at about

13:15
right now. They're officially south of
Land Bank as of
2:29pm
. Just wondering if more are coming! -Cassie Barclay
*

1:45 0.m. - K calls
.

1:28 p.m. - echolocation and J calls (S4)

hydrophone. Few
J calls

1:04 p.m. - echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 2:
L54s
- What an extra special day! Within 10 minutes from our docks we found
Southern Resident Killer Whales and humpback whales right out front of Sooke
! The Orca were actively feeding against a strong flood tide and they seemed to be finding plenty of salmon.

A beautiful evening brings to a close and extraordinary day spent viewing the
T46s, T122, & T137s
from her home on the
west side of Henderson Bay, Key Peninsula
. -Photo taken by Ingrid Shumway

Entry 3:

This evening a pod of
orcas swam into Henderson Bay
almost all the way up to the Purdy Spit and back. They were there from around

6:30 p.m. to sundown
. -Photo by Malissa Hutchings,

Entry 4:
*
We were out for a boat cruise this evening trying to beat the heat when we saw the
Orcas
. We never expected to see whales in
Henderson Bay
, especially as far north in the bay as we were (almost to Purdy). We cut our engine and sat and watched them go by. They were so beautiful! What made me sad were all the boats getting too close and going too fast. Some boats were actually chasing them and doing what I think is referred to as leap frogging. How do we educate people to follow the rules for whale watching and to be more careful? Many likely do not follow this page but it still seems that they should know better. It makes me fearful that they won't return if they feel "harassed" though I guess this must happen in other locations as well? Please spread the word to boaters to be more careful and respectful of these beautiful creatures. Sunset hour with
T137 in Henderson Bay, Key Peninsula
. -Lisa Turnure
*
Orcas, at least 4 or more in Henderson Bay
. Off of Horsehead bay by buoy mid channel now at

8:40pm
. -Char and Don Berger
*

7:30 p.m. - 5 orca on Henderson Bay between Raft Island and Minter Creek in middle of bay
. Heading North. About a half hour later they returned heading south out of the bay. Quite a few boats were following their progress. The boats were pretty close to the whales. Please remember to give them plenty of room. -Kevin Stroh

Dear friends at Orca Network, I am happy to share my images from

Entry 5:
orcas visited Henderson Bay, Key Peninsula
. They came through the bay, heading north towards Purdy about

6:30 pm
, and later returned south, heading out to open waters. I live on the westside of Henderson Bay and was able to capture the images from my terrace. Happy to share them with you, and hope they might be valuable to your exciting research. ...I would enjoy hearing from you. -Best regards, Ingrid Shumway
*
Observed a pod of
four Orcas in Henderson Bay
. They traveled North to the head of the bay then turned around and headed South towards Carr Inlet. -Daniel Arnold
*
Final post of the evening for me... after heading south
past mouth of Horsehead Bay
(directly across from our house), they stopped southern movement and seem to have stalled and travelled northward again, probably finding some good feeding (?). Look forward to checking in tomorrow. -Sarah Richey Guenther
*
They were pummeling a seal there. Made quite a mess.

Entry 10:
8:00
tonight. Heading south
into Budd Inlet
- mid channel - and I lost sight of it (
humpback
) after it cleared the
Cooper Point
shoreline. This animal had some white on its fluke, as seen by my husband through binoculars. No photo of that. If that's true, this is a different animal than the one here a week ago. -Photo by Kim Merriman

Thank you. We saw it (

Devils Point
for the last hour. Lost where it went though. -Robin Matthews

12:10 p.m. - One small humpback
(is that an oxymoron?) passed right by my boat. It is in
Nisqually Reach
now headed north towards Johnson Point. 50 feet off shore. Never showed its fluke. -Nick Wenzel
*
July 24 - I took these last nite (24th) and I believe there is more than one? Can you tell from these? Of course, I tried not to get too close so I had to crop all of these... I did only see one at a time, but my husband and friend both believe there are 2-3
bottlenose deep into Henderson Bay
- just traveling back and forth - feeding?
