Orca Sightings for July 4, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spent
July 4th with the
T37As
as they traveled north from
Lopez Sound to San Juan Channel
. They continued north along the shoreline of San Juan Island. We left them around
9pm
to sail back for the fireworks. Photos enclosed of the orcas passing Friday Harbor. (Note - these orcas along with T51 were in Eastsound on Orcas Island last year). -Cheers, Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Happy 4th! We caught up with our
humpback friend, "Scratchy"
just
west of Deception Pass
, and followed him/her heading north. After a trip around Smith and Minor Islands to see puffins, California Sea lions, harbor seals (including a nursing pup!) and eagles, we spent a bit more time with the humpback, then headed back towards the marina. But wow! we got a call that there were
orcas in Lopez Sound
, so were able to see the lovely
T37A
family! Her three calves are growing up! They were in traveling mode, changing direction within the Sound. What a great way to celebrate Independence Day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.

The hot streak continues. We have had an awesome stretch of encounters lately including tonight when we had the
T065A's, T175, T176s and the T124A's right in Cowichan Bay
!! At one point,
T065A2
breached right in front of the boat and I managed to snap this one. -Photo by Gary Sutton,

Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research reviewed many of Marg's photos: "That's
T175 and T65A2
in the first four frames plus others. Looks like the group included at least the
T49As, T65As, T176s, and T175
."
