============================================================

Entry 1:
...finding the whales off
San Juan County Park at 1300
. They found the same group of whales that they encountered the previous day, with the addition
J31
, in roughly the same sub-groupings. The
J14s, J22s, J31, and L87
were in the lead, followed by the
K16s, K21, and the J17s
. As in the previous encounter,
J44 and J47 were socializing with K35
, while J35 followed a bit behind the rest of the J17s. The team confirmed that J35 was still carrying her neonate,...See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 53.

I don't know how we got so lucky! This morning between teaching violin lessons, our neighbor Joe texted me and said, "whales are still there!" (
Carr Inlet
) I had a 3 hour teaching break so replied, "let's hop in my car and head to the boat!" After a near boat/gas disaster (long story), we were heading home pretty glum. And then we spotted them! We stayed 200 yards away (photos taken with 15-300mm lens), as is the law. Although one time, one went RIGHT under our boat, making waves on the surface, and you could FEEL its heft under there. The neighbor boys kept exclaiming how they were all SO unbelievably lucky. I concur. And in front of Mt Rainier to boot! The last time I saw whales, I was their age on MY neighbor's boat, and now they can grow up saying the same. -Cora Reuter Foster
*

1:15 p.m -
I am directly across from
Raft Island
at the mouth of Glen Cove. About
1:15 a pod of maybe 5 came through, they were split up and diving deep and long, headed towards Henderson Bay. -Barb Horn Hartman

12:45 p.m. -
A mile and a half north of Penrose point, west shoreline of
Carr Inlet, T137pod
just killed a porpoise so most of them are grouped up again slowly northbound. But T137A was still on the other side of the inlet (east side) by himself. We are leaving the scene.

12:00 noon - T137pod and T46 pod northbound from McNeil island aiming towards Carr Inlet
, very spread out. -Bart Rulon, Saratoga

There are 8 out here right now, headed back West towards Lakebay. The group has predated now.
1145
, whale watching boat has been here for about ten minutes now

Actually, I just found them on a kill.
North side of McNeil
. Eating something of size. -Matt Graham
*
I have 3 reports and multiple photos from the
Anderson Island
FB page today with reports of the
orcas (presumably still the T137s and T46s) at
7:30am
tracking west past the ferry dock, toward
Eagle Island
and west past Eagle. I don't know yet which direction they went from there. I'll update if I hear more! -Belen Bilgic Schneider

Entry 4:
Orcas in Rosario Strait
(from the house we are renting on Peapod Lane on the east side of Orcas Island). We watched them for 30 minutes or so as they transited north to south through the main channel,
between the Peapod rocks and Cypress Island
; we first spotted them looking to the northeast toward Lummi Island from our vantage point and watched through the time we lost them to view to the south, still in the main channel. There were three for sure, most likely four. Because of their distance from our view point and us viewing via 10x42 binoculars, we cannot report any identifying information - we didn't have good enough looks. One may have been a male, but hard to say, although one did have a larger dorsal fin. -Bryan and Kathy Slinker

Entry 5:
a small humpback in Elliott Bay tonight around
8:30 PM
. Amazing to see and hear the powerful blows from my kayak. -Steve Smith
*
Observered
a Humpback Whale several times near shore at Chambers Bay
golf course, beach access. It was heading north towards the
Narrows bridge
. One was reported in the Olympia area yesterday. Could be same individual. I am a very experienced bird and whale observer. I first saw it blow down by the Steilcoom ferry dock around

8:50 a.m.
It continued heading towards the beach I was birding on with multiple sightings
till
9:30
. I did see it tail flap several times but mostly located it when it blew. -Bruce LaBar
