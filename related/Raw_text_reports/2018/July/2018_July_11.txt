We sure do treasure the opportunity to bring this pleasure and awe to so many people from around the globe! Today with
12+ humpback whales around Race Rocks Light House
- some tail lobbing, peck slapping and multiple breaches that I seemed to miss the shot each time...Got a splash though, also many harbour pourpise, seals, a sea lion, a sea otter, many bald eagles and of course a couple beautiful Elephant seals. (images of Pauls included
MMX0006
) -Paul Pudwell

July 11 trip report - on another picture perfect day, we found a Humpback whale (Scratchy) and many Minke whales (4 or 5)
!! But that's not all, lots of harbor seals (some with newborn pups), Steller sea lions, Tufted Puffins, Bald eagles, a harbor porpoise or two - all in the vicinity of Smith and Minor Islands, and Partridge Bank. The Salish Sea is rich in wildlife, we cannot predict what will show up next. No orca reports today, but they'll be back! A super windless day for viewing wildlife. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Entry 6:
From Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "Stump, and a possible second bottlenose, have been seen in Dana Passage regularly since Monday. With the help of Kim and others onshore we were able to find her on Tuesday. It was our first two dolphin species day in the South Sound, with the long-beaked common dolphins in Case Inlet
. If anyone comes across the dolphins when out on the water, make sure to give them plenty of space to do their thing. The common dolphins will probably come over to investigate you if they aren't busy feeding. And remember to send in your reports, they are really helpful!"
