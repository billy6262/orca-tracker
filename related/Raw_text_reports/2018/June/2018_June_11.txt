Today we awoke to some fantastic sounds - the
Southern Resident Killer Whales were vocalizing on Lime Kiln Point State Park hydrophone
. First time they've been back since end of March. We could identify calls of
J and L Pods
. As the tide switched to flood, the orcas headed north and so did we in "Peniel". We met up with the orcas just
north of Turn Point Lighthouse
. The whales were spread in many loose groups. We found the trailers, the
J17's and L87
. Together we travelled along N. Pender Island up towards Active Pass. As we bumped up we encountered several other groups along the way, including
J22, J38 with J37 and son, J49
and a larger group up ahead, the
L47's with L90
. We were surprised not to see
L92 "Crewser"
in the group. Upon entering
Active Pass
, the orcas picked up speed and began porpoising - what a sight to see as the spray from the orcas' wake revealed a rainbow from the sun. We obtained some distant orca photos and also photographed
L72 with son L105
. We watched them continue on towards the direction of Vancouver before taking Georgeson Pass to start our journey for home. Our hearts felt so happy seeing our beloved SRKW's.

8:10 p.m. - L12s
have grouped tight, now just seeing blows off in the distance. Still drifting south out from
South Beach
. Currently still one WW boat with hardy peeps out there.

We have moved south, see
L12s
south streaming down island still, currently out from about
Eagle Cove
. We are at South Beach and see them well offshore. From American Camp/South Beach

5:30 -
6:15 p.m. -
Arrived to
Land Bank/West Side Preserve
north pullout just in time to spot a lovely member of
L pod
right out in front of us. Over the next 45 minutes or so we watched many stream southbound super spread out, a few inshore, several others offshore, including 2 males. Much breaching happening to the south and way offshore, ~ 2 miles or so. Was invigorating. Gorgeous sunny day in a beautiful place. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network (with Marilyn Armbruster)

A picture perfect morning on the west side of San Juan Island today: flat, glassy blue waters and - finally - the return of the Southern Residents.

As moments like these become fewer and farther between, this morning was a solid reminder to never take any second with these animals for granted. Hi
J Pod and L Pod
, you dear creatures...so good to see you...Photo by Katie Jones,

These two reporting parties (one written, one video) wish to remain anonymous: They looked incredible and were breaching, tail slapping, pec waves and underside showing. I was at
Westside Preserve
and it was a long
3.5 hours
but loved every minute of it. I got there just as the leaders passed by, no ID of the 2 females and youngster but they turned around just past
Lime Kiln
and joined the others NB.I felt like they were foraging and checked out the scene ahead of the group and came and said" it looks good let's go North. Apparently the L12's are passing by Land Bank SB because they turned around at Henry. The rest continued NB. -Anonymous

June 11 - San Juans - Trip Report: Another beautiful, sunshiny day as we left Anacortes with reports of orcas, including the Residents! After we checked out some harbor seals on Colville Island, Capt. Eric spotted a
humpback by Iceberg Point on Lopez Island
. We got a few good looks, including a nice fluke-up tail dive. We then headed to the
north side of Orcas Island to visit with some lovely transients, including some T49s and T75s
. With minimal boat traffic with this group, we were able to enjoy watching them travel around the Pea Pod Islands, toward Barnes and Clark Island.
T75B and T75B2.
