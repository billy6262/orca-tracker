Entry 1:
San Juans -
T77s - Amazing pass by Cattle Point Lighthouse
. T77s....Thank you! These are all new whales to me! My mom and I were on shore at the Cattle Point LH when the 77s turned around in Cattle Pass and came right below us. -Photo by Ariel Yseth,

Entry 2:

The water int the straits was flat calm. The lighting with sun breaking through the clouds illuminated Minke whales at Partridge Bank, Steller Sea Lions and Bald Eagles at Whale Rocks, and the
T77 group of Transient Killer Whales along Lopez Island
to top it all off (not to mention a bold little Rhinoceros Auklet who swam right alongside the boat while the orcas were on a dive). Justine Buckmaster

still in steady travel mode heading south offshore, but very much on the peninsula side. Long dive, 10 minute down time where they basically surfaced in the near same location after coming into view. They then continued now more SE bound heading towards Fox Island and surfaced in front of us out from the bluff just east of Green Point.

Rare treat on the way into Tacoma today! A
pod of orcas passed in front of the ferry
as it departed Vashon (

7:10am
). I will try to post images later....I saw them from the bow of the Chetzemoka,
7:10 sailing to Tacoma. They were moving east to west along the rip current. The male was trailing a small group of 4-6 who went deep as the ferry departed. The came up again closer to Vashon, west of the ferry terminal. The fishing boats noticed and motored over for a look. I tried to catch them on my phone, but they were too far away. - Mitch Kent
