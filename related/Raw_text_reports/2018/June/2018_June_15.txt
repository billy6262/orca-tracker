A few pics from
Lime Kiln State Park
...It was around

4:00 p.m
. when the orcas came by the lighthouse. A beautiful look at
J16 Slick off Lime Kiln park. J16's grown son J26 Mike
passing by the park.. When I took the pic of the
humpback at
3:45
I was at one of the pull outs coming into the park. That coincided with the
J's working their way up to the lighthouse
. He/she came surfaced close to shore and the J's where just a few hundred yards further out. Incredible day for sure. -Brian Nygren

J-Pod
has been around all week! It's enough just that they are here, but then to have moments like this....wow. This is
J16 Slick
right off the kelp at Lime Kiln Lighthouse this afternoon.
J16 Slick
spent a solid five minutes going back and forth in the kelp off the
Lime Kiln Lighthouse this afternoon
! A good old fashioned west side shuffle kinda day - J-Pod passed Lime Kiln six times today! We got to see the morning (top), noon (middle), and night (bottom)! -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

Coastal Killer whales -
May 15 - We received email from Scott Mercer on
June 8th relaying report of
Orcas off Point Arena Lighthouse
circa 5/15/18 by Sara Bogard. Sara adds: "They were attacking a pinniped."
(
ID notes by Alisa Schulman-Janiger of the California Killer Whale Project: " The one whale does match to a whale that we have rarely seen, no CA ID number yet; not confirmed for over 2 years. Very cool!"
