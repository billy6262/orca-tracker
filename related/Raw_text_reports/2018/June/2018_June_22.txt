Orca Sightings for June 22, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another lovely day! We caught up with the
T65A family of Biggs/Transient
(meat-eating), along with a few
T49As
orcas just off
Lopez Island
, then followed them through Lopez Pass. They became extremely active, hunting a harbor seal, with massive and multiple tail slaps, lunging back and forth, and then some spy hops and breaches. After consuming the prey, they took some power naps. This family matriarch is T65A (born 1986), with her son
T65A2 (2004), and 4 other calves (A3-2007, A4-2011, A5-2014, and new baby A6-4/2018)
. They have been seen many times around the Salish Sea this season. As we left them to their rest, we motored out to Lawrence Reef, south west of Burrows Island, and found a humpack, reported to be BCY Unknown "Scratchy." Fabulous sunny summer day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

At Lopez Island in Lopez Pass/Sound
and Humpback
southwest of Burrows Island not far from Deception Pass. So awesome seeing the
orcas at Lopez Island
and going into Lopez Sound. Beautiful background, just gorgeous hanging in there, different scenery. Nice breach by one of the
T65As or T49As in Lopez Pass

Minke whales -

Entry 5:
7:55 a.m -
3-4 minke whales off the coast in Freeland
, off spy glass road. Swimming and feeding. Traveling south east. One is traveling north west. (I would not say I was 100% certain. Given the looks we had, speed and feeding we took our
best guess
that they were minke. But
it is possible we are wrong.
