Orca Sightings for June 21, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
(Both Residents or Bigg's were in this area around this time, without photos or positive ID's cannot confirm ecotype - alb) Southern Residents -
June 21 - Summer Solstice Orca Encounter no. 3! Sublime is the only way describe the gift of getting to sit in such a place as
Cattle Point and witness members of L pod
travel through the turbulent waters of Cattle Pass. The first sight of this group (ID'd as the
L4s, L47s, L72s, and L90
by Monika Wieland Shields) was their towering blows rising above the rocks at Cape San Juan to the north of the park at

5:31pm
. They continued in steady travel mode powering through the pass, back-dropped by lovely Lopez Island, went on the east side of Goose Island and exited the pass moving out of sight as they rounded the point under Cattle Point light house about
5:45 pm. We moved over to the bluffs east of the lighthouse and watched as they launched into series of non stop breaches! They continued to be very surface active while continuing SW for a while and then seemed to split up and stall out. They were offshore South Beach when we left at just before 6PM. This group of Ls came down from the north in the morning and chose San Juan Channel/Cattle Pass while
Js & L87 chose the west side
. Heart happy first day of summer filled with sunshine, choppy seas, a whole lot of orcas, alongside a good friend. Filmed from Cattle Point, a stunning & powerful beloved place on earth. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Ls (L4s, L47s, L72s, and L90) southbound nearing Cattle Pass; Js northbound nearing Lime Kiln
17:15
. Ls were at Green Point on Spieden around
14:30 and exited Cattle Pass at
17:45. -Monika Wieland Shields

Summer Solstice Orca Encounter no. 2!
J pod and L87 came down from the north
spread out many miles apart, passing
Lime Kiln Lighthouse by early afternoon (first visible to the north from the lighthouse ~
1:15pm
). Shortly before a family of
Bigg's (see T49As
video) swam northbound on course for the residents, they quickly turned around passing us again southbound approx 15 minutes ahead of the lead J pod members.
Js & L87
streamed past very spread out, powering south, at times porpoising in choppy seas with occasional breaches, tail lobs, and what was presumed to be salmon chasing (just after 1 minute mark in the video). Last of the Js passed us on the rocks around

2:07 pm
. A heartfelt Thursday solstice afternoon bathed in sunshine and howling winds, bare feet to the warm rocks and eyes on the beautiful, but struggling, endangered Southern Residents. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Mammal-eating Bigg's Killer Whales traveled northbound past us at

, further from shore and more spread out. They turned around when they were out of sight and then came back by us southbound at

Entry 4:

Just as we (Gayle Swigart & I) were settling in on the rocks at
Lime Kiln
light to wait for southbound
Southern Resident orcas J pod & L87
(salmon eating type), a family of
Bigg's/Transients the T49As
(mammal eating type) who were a surprise to everyone showed up a bit offshore heading northbound on course towards lead Js. The T49As passed us northbound at

12:47 pm
, and with little choice but to turn back passed us again at
1:03 pm this time southbound breathtakingly close, our bodies shaking & hearts pounding in their wake.
J pod leaders were within sight by
1:19pm
. No one knew about or had reported this family of Ts so it was a great surprise to us when we pulled up in the parking lot, told a family there were orcas, and they responded with yes, orcas were at the south end of the park; a tad confused we wondered had more residents come in? had some lead Js snuck by? Once down on the rocks, we find Bob and those who conduct research each summer getting settled in as well and were just as surprised as us. A sweet summer solstice bonus gift forever embedded in our beings. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Unidentified killer whales -

Entry 5:
11:54 a.m -
We are out at
East Point on Saturna Island
and we just saw approximately
5 orcas pass along East Point
around to Cliffside. It was the best! Thought I'd let you know. -Jacquie Brown

Entry 6:
3:30 p.m - Humpbacks in Carr Inlet / Henderson Bay
. Watched 2 humpbacks from Raft Island on
June 21. At one point swam in the narrow channel between Raft Island & Allen Point. I'm not a whale expert but the small dorsal fin was the giveaway. 47.343168, -122.681331. -Steve Broschart
*

12:30 pm - Two whales swimming up Henderson Bay
towards Wauna. They were in middle of bay between Raft Island and mouth of Minter Creek. They were swimming slowly to the north. They seemed large and had lots of body coming out of the water before seeing a small dorsal fin. I think they were humpbacks. Leisurely swimming, no deep diving. their flukes did not come out of the water when they submerged. -Kevin Stroh

Entry 7:

fairly close to shore from our house at
Meadow Point at
