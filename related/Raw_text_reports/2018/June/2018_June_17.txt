Entry 2:
Single Orca right out from at Bush Point

Possession Sound and Port Susan (T36, T36Bs, T137s
) About
10 pm
on Sunday
June 17th about
8 orcas
were observed between
Mission Beach and Hat Island
heading East. We haven't seen orcas since the late 40's in these waters. This group was sighted about 2,00 feet out from the "old Bower'piling. At this time of the year we have some Chinook returning to the Tulalip hatchery. -Thomas Hoban
*

7:33 p.m. -
we just left them - they passed right by a small grey and three seals without interest near
Camano Head
. Is there a confirmation of what group this was? There seem to be about nine of them, but they passed quite close to both a gray whale, and at least two seals, without expressing any interest. -Amitava Michael Kundu

two Orcas in Port Susan Bay
6/17 around

At least 5 orcas
headed north in
Port Susan at

When where these actually seen because I swear I just saw the same thing less than an hour ago (~
9am
) in
Hansville
just north of the Point (Point No Point)...It looked like two heading north...they where pretty far out also. -Michelle Hardy
*

9:50 a.m - Likely humpback (confirmed) one mile north of Apple Tree Cove off Kingston
near Kitsap side. Couldn't ID. Heading northbound. See Facebook VIDEO. -Jordan Talge

Entry 6:
Gray whale in Penn Cove at
6:30
this morning while I was out rowing. I have some video from about 200 yds away after I rowed to shore. The water was awesome! I heard it behind me. It was pretty close! -CeCe Celia Aguda
*

Entry 7:
7:34 a.m -
I am also seeing a very tall narrow blow by
Gedney Island
not with the orcas. I'm wondering if there is humpback out there or something. Way too far for me to identify with binoculars. It's
in the normal place the greys feed
by the Snohomish River Delta. It was heading north and then went behind Gedney/Hat Island out of view. -Danielle Pennington

Unidentified whales -

Entry 8:
10:56 a.m -
Grey just passed by
Point No Point, closer to Useless Bay
. Lots of porpoises, too! ("It was
probably a humpback
, then. We were far away", when asked how certain and mentioned humpbacks in area - alb ). -Lexi Magnusson
