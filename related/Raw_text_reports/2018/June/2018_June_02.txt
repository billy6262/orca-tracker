transient orcas taken from south side of Saturna
. Orcas traveling in easterly direction from Monarch Head to East Point. -Photo by James McLarnon, Vancouver,

Entry 2:
a Gray whale near the entrance to the Oak Harbor Marina
, off Blower's Bluff at

3:10 pm
, 1/4 mile south of the buoy. Unable to get any photos, but said it was definitely a gray whale, with a lot of spots. (possibly the Unknown 2018 #2 that has been hanging out and feeding in that area the past month or so).

Shawn Bashor sent photos (below) & VIDEO of

Entry 4:
a group of orcas that appeared to be harassing two humpback whales, "Split Fin" and "Zig Zag"
but the scuffle had just ended when we got there. The HB's appeared to be ok. -Barbara & David, All Aboard Sailing

Dolphins -

Entry 5:
5:25 p.m. - Small pod of dolphins off of Sunrise Beach in Gig Harbor.
It was hard to tell direction. They were going back and forth and then after about 30 min I couldn't see them any more. They
looked like common dolphins
. But I could be wrong they were pretty far away. But they were not surfacing like porpoises. I am a dolphin nerd and I have seen many in the wild and my best guess would be common dolphins. Such an incredible experience. I wasn't even looking for them this time lol we just went there to hang out and cool off and bam! DOLPHINS. -Jessica Hill

9:27 a.m. - They've passed Alki Light
, either headed north or into Elliott Bay. There's two between the eastbound Bremerton Ferry and Alki Beach heading NE.

8:58 a.m -
They were bigger than and not as rounded as [dolpins]. Travelling in smaller groups of 1-4 stretched out over a hundred yards or so, frequent breathing made them easy to follow (unlike harbor porpoise). We've driven down to Alki, they're spread out between the Light and northbound lanes, much less organized but still easy to spot from shore.

8:15 a.m - A pod of ~7 just passed Lincoln Park northbound
, looked bigger than harbor porpoise. (More from Andrew: We think common, and watched a lot of videos just now of the two. The ones we saw lacked the head-out posture and two-part movements of the bottlenose, and
seem to have the more upright dorsal of the common
.) -Andrew Malinak

Entry 6:
Lakebay area shortly after
11:00am
...This was
a group of four
. And they came up for air often....I recall seeing some white (per Dave Anderson asking if seeing white or yellow on their sides). -Chalcy Blake
ID notes per Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research after reviewing cell videos by both Michelle Larsen and Chalcy Blake and some discussion: "Given the location, the shape of their dorsal fins and their group size, it is
most likely the group of long-beaked common dolphins that really like Carr Inlet
. If they had white on their sides, that would make me almost certain."
