Entry 9:
Charleston, OR
- Hello! My friend Ellie and I spotted
a single Orca last night around 9pm
just west of the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (Charleston OR) jetty, near the red buoy. The dorsal fin was rather long, so we're thinking it's a male. It wasn't close enough to see markings or the saddle patch. It surfaced a total of three times, and was heading out of the bay. I have attached a photo of the Orca to this email! -Date and time of sighting: 6/4/18
8:57 pm - Location: 43.3510N -124.3311W. -Thank you, Morgan Janes & Ellie Jones

There were whale blows in front of
