Orca Sightings for June 28, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:03 a.m - Residents just went through Active Pass
heading toward The Fraser River. -Rachelle Hayden

Orca sighting from
S. shore of Saturna
. Background: Initially sited Harbour porpoise about 7pm; unusual since in very close to cottage, Followed, about 5 min later, by single orca; also unusual since
orca was solo
. Looked like orca (reported as transient, was residents) was pursuing porpoise. Followed much later (in excess of 20 min) with remaining pod members (
4-6 in number
) with two shown. Interesting since extremely wide gap between first orca and the followers. Perhaps points out the hunting capabilities of the orcas. Outcome of hunt unknown, but there were 2 whale-watching boats located off Monarch Head which could view subsequent activity. I would appreciate any info as to the id of the pod.

While we were with the transients in Encounter 41, we heard over the radio that
J and L pods had been found farther north off the Fraser
river mouth heading south....We got on scene with Js and Ls at
1640
a little over halfway
between Pt. Roberts and Patos Island
. The whales were very spread out and foraging on their way south towards Boundary Pass. We first saw
J35 and J47
to the west of most of the others and the pair was loosely spread and seemed to foraging...-Full encounter summary and photos at Center for Whale Research #42.

Entry 2:
Killer whales spotted in Burrard Inlet
- Researchers with the Vancouver Aquarium's Ocean Wise research team spotted killer whales in Burrard Inlet earlier today. "The last report we received was of the whales near Spanish Banks, so, although we can't predict their path, it sounds like they briefly came into Burrard Inlet and then headed out again," says aquarium spokesperson Deanna Lancaster.

Entry 3:
T175-a
rare visitor to the Salish Sea, found north of East Point heading north...Along with
T65A2
, this turned out to be
T176
, plus a large juvenile/subadult that is probably
T176A
, and a small juvenile of T176's. This recent visit (6/27-6/29) by the T176s is the first time, to our knowledge, that this matriline has been documented in the inside waters around southern Vancouver Island. - See full encounter with photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 41.

humpback whale
.5 mi WNW away from the
Steilacoom
fishing dock. It was headed north. -Brandon Simek

8:00 a.m -
Large whale heading north past
Steilacoom
right now. I'm thinking
humpback
, no tail view. Was cool, was laying in bed and just happened to look outside and there it was. I took video, but so far away. -Lisa Wiksten
