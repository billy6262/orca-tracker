Passed

. Two in front, several and the new baby behind. They stopped north of the point for about 10 minutes and appeared to be on a hunt. Then they proceeded south. They were very close in to shore but started heading a bit more into the channel SB from the point at a steady, leisurely pace. Pictures to come...got a nice one of the baby. -Sara Frey
