Orca Sightings for May 9, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:18 p.m. - two grays northbound up Saratoga
, mid channel, just passed northeast corner of Gedney.

9:23 a.m - One gray
just passed us, heading south, close to shore. East side of
Gedney
. There are boats galore as there's another spotted prawn opening today. Hopefully he/she makes it safely through the maze of it all! -Lori Christopher

Entry 2:
6:30 p.m - Whale of unknown species in Vaughn Bay in Case Inlet
. Only top of head and blows visible. Shallow diving, no rolls, no visible dorsal fins or flukes. Staying in the deeper half of the bay. The tide is low and is probably leery about crossing the shallows to exit the bay. it will probably be here until high tide, hopefully it won't get stranded in the shallows. ....There was a post in reply to my post of a short video of probably the same whale in neighboring Rocky Bay last Sunday just drifting with full length of the body barely above water. No dorsal,
almost positive a small grey

Entry 3:
Hammersley Inlet near Shelton. At about
12:30 a.m.
my neighbor and I heard what
sounded like a whale exhaling
and splashing water in front of our homes. Of course it was too dark to see anything. My husband believes it was an extremely large harbor seal. He did not hear the exhale sound. -Debbera Coker
