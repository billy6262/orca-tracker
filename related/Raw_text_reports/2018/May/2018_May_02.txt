Spotted a blow in Saratoga passage this morning near Whidbey shore,
south of Baby Island
, north of the green six-second navigational light. We have seen a few over there this year. Usually we see Gray whales coming and going to the shallow waters on Camano with the incoming tide to feed on the mudflats and going out mid channel afterwards. -Pat Vivolo
