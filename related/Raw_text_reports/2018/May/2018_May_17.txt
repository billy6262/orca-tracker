Orca Sightings for May 17, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Last Thursday Lennie and I had the most amazing experience with the
Southern Resident orcas off Estevan Point - North West of Tofino
. Initially the report was of 30 orcas, but
All of J pod, and members of K and L were seen
, with more whales on the horizon we could not get photos of. It is possible the entire population of Southern Residents was in the area!
Southern Resident Orcas off Hesquiaht Harbour and Estevan Light
- I got a report of 30+ whales off Hotsprings Cove yesterday afternoon (
May 17th). We got on scene at
5 pm and by then the pod was 5 miles west of Barney Rocks
. They had been milling for most of the afternoon according to other boats on scene. They also described foraging behaviours, which I observed when I was on scene. Our fish finder did show that there were large amounts of fish in the area! I wasn't sure who we had at first. It has been close to 4 years since I have seen southern residents so I was a bit rusty with ID's at first and I thought we were dealing with Northern Residents. Suddenly I recognized the great
L41! And then J27 and L25
.... Tasli helped with with some ID's through messenger.
L89
was also identified on scene. There were some whales further off shore that we didn't get to spend time with. For the most part they were quite spread out but near the end of our time with them they formed a tight group (J Pod anyways, from what I could tell, the L's were further out) and began travelling west at a consistent 5 knots. We left them at

7:13pm directly offshore of the Estevan Lighthouse

(
ID notes by Monika Wieland Shields based on reviewing ID's by Brendon Bissonnette and the photos herself: "
All of J-Pod, the K13s, and L12 sub-group
were all identified in her photos - but she said there was more offshore that they didn't photograph and she thought it could have been enough whales for it to be all of them."
