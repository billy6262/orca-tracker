Mary Jo Adams sees a
gray whale in Crescent Harbor
(Oak Harbor) near the little bridge, swimming west... Hi, Here are a few photos of the gray whale that I saw today in Crescent Harbor. I hope they will be helpful in identifying it.....I'm not sure what the whale was doing, it kept rolling around and sticking its head out of the water. I haven't seen one behave like that before. -Mary Jo Adams
Lovely face of a gray whale. This is who for now we refer to as
Unknown #2
. This whale was first photographed by Mary Jo on
April 9th in North Saratoga and s/he has been there ever since. Cascadia Research had no match for this whale.

On
Pebble Beach, Camano Is, near Mabana Beach
, we had a thrilling Sunday morning yesterday,

8:00 am
, when we awoke to
#531
lazily feeding right off our bulkhead. She rolled, twisted, turned in circles as she bulldozed through the mud. The water is shallow and we wondered how she could do it. She fed for about 40 minutes then headed south, leaving the water the color of dirt and our mouths still dropping. In the afternoon, at low tide, the seagulls jumped up and down in the puddles to work the huge horse clams up out of their holes. -Peg Boley
*

8:00 a.m -
Mornings with unidentified
gray (originally reported as #531)
are incredible, rain or shine. She spent about 30 minutes feeding in our front yard before moving on to the south. I zoom out mid video so you can see how close to shore she is....she's still here!
8:00am east side of
Gedney
moving south. -Lori Christopher

Humpback whales -

Entry 8:
three humpback whales, including Split Fluke (BCX1068 b. 2006), between Active Pass and Point Roberts/Strait of Georgia
. These gentle giants were traveling in tandem, their powerful heart-shaped blows shimmering against the backdrop of the sun's glare. Some of our favorite pinnipeds, Steller sea-lions and Pacific harbor seals, gave us a cursory glance as we passed their rocky perch, leaving the Stellers to continue their argument (at least that's how it looked) as we wended our way among the San Juan archipelago. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea
