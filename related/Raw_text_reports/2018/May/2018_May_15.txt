Entry 6:
3:00 p.m. - we saw a gray whale traveling north in Dana Passage near Dickinson Point
....My view from the beach was limited, and my husband caught a view from our deck, which is about 50' above the beach. We didn't get any photos or videos, and when it surfaced it was a very limited view, just breaking the surface very regularly and no tail showing. The breathing was not as loud as other whales we've seen, where the spouting is more dramatic. -Pam Rhubart
