I get up early to savor the sunrises, and sing to the whales. This morning they came and sang back to me! Four of them, plus some harbor seals! These beautiful, majestic gray whales will soon depart for Alaska. (Two went on towards Everett, and the feeding pair turned around and went back North towards Camano).

Entry 4:
Sandy Point
bluff and could see
2 gray spouts out from Langley
. Stopped at Seawall Park, took Kai for a little walk so that I could watch them. They were on their way south to Sandy Pt, 5 min away. I headed back there, saw both of them rounding the point pretty close in. I was up on high bank..a nice half hr or so of whale energy before heading back home.
