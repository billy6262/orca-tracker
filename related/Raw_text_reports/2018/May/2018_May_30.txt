Entry 5:
Harbor porpoise
at
Hood Canal Bridge
(north side) right now! the dorsal was very small and that's how I knew they weren't orcas I saw 3-4 fins, but there could have been more and they seemed to be heading alongside the bridge heading west ...it looked as tho they were in a big circle of an area rather than along each other going the same direction...(after further discussion and photo to compare: "The bottom left photo (harbor porpoise) is exactly what the dorsal looked like ..was a short fin, it was most likely a porpoise...) -Megan Blake
