Entry 2:
*
A spectacular Mother's Day on the Salish Sea - we traveled a long way to find a humpback out by
Constance Bank
, and as we were almost home our eagle-eyed Captain Eric spotted Transient/Biggs killer whales by Allan Island - what a catch! They were the
T101s and T102
and we had some amazing viewing of this grouping of
4 whales
, as they passed
Deception Pass
and headed south-west. Along with Tufted Puffins, seals, a few harbor porpoise, and dead calm seas, it truly was a super Mother's Day!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

Entry 3:
Minke whales down to the south of San Juan Island
. We were treated to
perhaps 8-10 different Minke whales
feeding in an area. We had Minkes on all sides of us as they zigged and zagged looking for forage fish the birds were targeting. After an incredible counter with those lovely baleen whales, we got word some Bigg's Killer whales had been spotted way up to the north! The Western Explorer II's speed allowed us to head up and see these whales as well. What an amazing way to spend Mother's Day with our guests!

2:39 p.m -
Michael Brusker reported
a gray whale south of Sandy Point
, Whidbey Island. Initially reported as whale along with possible fighting porpoise, but thanks to his video (and Connie Bickerton) he and we know it was a gray feeding on her/his side in the shallows with pec fin and half of the fluke exposed...

San Juan Clipper called in a report of
two grays, 723 Lucifer and 53 Little Patch, milling in Possession Sound
well south of the ferry lanes at

9:30 am
. Two speed boats came through way too last, almost hitting one of the whales, the Clipper sounded their horn to try to warn the boats to slow down.

Whale remains in the
