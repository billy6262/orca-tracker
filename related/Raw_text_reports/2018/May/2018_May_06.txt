Hi Alisa, Howie, and Susan, Here is a photo I took from Glacier Spirit yesterday of
T123A breaching west of Waldron Island
. He was with the T100 pod and they had just made a kill. -Photo by Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express,

Entry 3:
T002Cs and the T23s together (Just south of Cape Mudge on Quadra Island)
, after a while hanging around with these guys we made the choice to go around Mittle Natch, where we by accident met the
T19's
, they ended up getting together with the rest of the families and they gave us a show we will never forget!!!!

Coastal killer whales -

Entry 4:
a pod of 8-10 orcas just off the Astoria waterfront
last evening. Are you able to track this pod? They were feeding in a concentrated area just east of the Astoria Megler Bridge on
May 6th between about

6:30pm and
8:45pm
. At dusk they headed west back out towards the river mouth. It was the end of tidal flood, slack high water. I'm hoping they will be back this evening and I can try to get more photos. "That is
T125A
