I just found
T49A2 trailing the T65As

still southbound
Discovery Park but only seeing T65As
now. Grouped up together. Lost sight of the rest. -Renee Beitzel

11:22 p.m. -
At least one group (
T65As
according to Renee and Justine) still in resting moving southbound, have passed West Point, Discovery Park, off Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle, and are drifting more westerly approaching Yeomalt Point and Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge.

10:30 a.m - orcas
have moved more towards mid, spread out a little bit. They are directly out from
Shilshole Marina
now navigating many holiday weekend boaters...most of all behaving quite respectfully.

10:00 a.m. - orcas
have grouped up and moved offshore. Currently off
Meadow Point
, north end Golden Gardens Park. Still moving slowly southbound.

9:40 a.m. - Carkeek
is the place to be! Pod (s?) are split in two groups about 1/2 mile apart. At least 2 males further down off the south end of Carkeek, mom
T65A, T65A6
, and others right off
Carkeek
!

9:20 a.m -
After relocating to
Carkeek Park
and having no luck finding them, Kevin Crosby arrived spotted
T65As & T49A2
just inside north end of the park. Pod is circling very lazily about 1/4 mile offshore. Water Is glassy calm!

8:40 a.m. - Pod
has drifted to east side mid channel as they continue southbound in resting mode.
Carkeek Park
, North Seattle would be good place to be next.

8:10 a.m. - pod of ~ 6
is slowly making their way down the channel (west of mid)
between Kingston and Jefferson Head
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Gray whales
(North Puget Sounders & friends) -

Entry 6:
1430
- Whale was swimming around probably feeding. It was white in color. I have a quick video but you can't see much (shows
gray whale
, see screen grab below -alb). Location:
Crescent Harbor
just off NAS Commissary. -Michael Head

Entry 7:
1:49 p.m. - (central Puget Sound, out from Port Madison
) Looking for the whale reported earlier...we found it, is a
humpback
. Heading north east-ish, directionally towards Point Wells. Mid channel. (later notes Renee: This is one of the humpbacks we saw in the group of 3 yesterday and today was alone.) -Renee Beitzel
Travels of "Neptune": S/he is match to 2nd whale in Tasli Shaw's video who was feeding with "Google" in Boundary Bay on
May 4th. (included in our WS Report dated
May 8), and match to whale photographed by William Riggs morning of
May 12th, between Lummi Island and Clark Island. (included in our WS Report dated
May 22), and match to whale photographed by Barbara Howitt on
May 21st, in this report below.

Unidentified cetaceans -

Entry 8:
10:20 a.m -
I'm on a boat a bit
west of Agate Pass bridge
and saw a large spray and then the arch of what appeared to be an Orca off of
Point Bolin (Bainbridge)
. We were too far away and heading the opposite direction (we were EB toward the bridge) so didn't get to see any more. I did see a dorsal, and I thought I saw a white patch (though we were far away so I may have imagined the white). I didn't see the tail. My boat partner didn't see the exhalation, just the dorsal arching out of the water and down. He questioned if it was a porpoise, but it was way too large from as far away as we were to have been a porpoise and the exhalation was way too large, and the descent back into the water was too slow to have been porpoise. As far away as we were, the dorsal seemed large in proportion to what I saw of the back, so I'm inclined to still say Orca, not Humpback or Grey. -Christy Jobe

Entry 9:
8:50 AM -
Maia at WSF's, relaying a report of
a small pod of juvenile orcas westbound in Thatcher Pass
.

Entry 10:
~

While waiting for the T65As & T49A2 to arrive, I observed an
abundance (dozens) of Harbor porpoise
spread widely off
Carkeek Park
in all directions. Of course they were sparse once the Ts arrived...Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
