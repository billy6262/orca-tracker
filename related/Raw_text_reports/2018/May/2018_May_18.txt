We had a great day on the San Juan Clipper today!
Three whale species
in one day! We saw
gray whale #531
feeding close to the shore of Whidbey Island on our northbound trip. On the whale and sealife search we decided to check out an area that no other boats had searched yet and were rewarded by the T100s in Boundary Pass...just north of Skipjack Island. We left as they were crossing the pass toward Saturna Island! On our way back to Seattle, we saw several Minke whales feeding at Partridge bank. Yay whale trifecta! Justine Buckmaster

Entry 4:
#53
exit - We motored out under gray skies and smooth water, traveling up to Cattle Pass and out to Romeo Buoy,
west of San Juan Island. We spent some lovely time with gray whale "Sounder" #53, Little Patch,
as he was heading out to the coast to complete his migration north. We then said "bon voyage" to him and head back east, looking at bald eagles, harbor seals and turkey vulture along the beautiful side of Lopez Island. Another lovely day on the Salish Sea. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea.

Farewell,
Little Patch (NPS #53)
! Island Explorer 4 just caught up with him in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca north of Dungeness Spit
. -Erin Johns Gless

We had
a single gray heading west just north of Pt Wilson this morning
. No ID but it didn't look like one of our Sounders. Update: just heard from another boat that it was
gray #53
(which was my first guess) but if so, that means right side has changed a lot! -Renee Beitzel

Entry 5:
(gray whale) is still there (Crescent Harbor)
. Just seen half an hour ago (

4:30 p.m
.) by my husband. -Sara Walter

Robert saw
two gray whales in Crescent Harbor
near the boat ramps this morning about

10:30 am
. I went by the same area later when the tide was going out and saw what appeared to be fresh feeding pits. -Mary Jo Adams
*

10:22 a.m - The grey
is there again (or still there) on the
Seaplane Navy base on Whidbey
. Is it normal for him to be surfacing to blow every minute? -Angel Almeyda
*
This was on the
Seaplane base in Oak Harbor this morning.
Beautiful. -Screen grab from video by Lauren Minckley,

Gray whales (South Puget Sound Unknowns) -

Entry 8:
appeared to be a Gray whale in the Titlow Beach cove in Tacoma
, WA on Friday
May 18th about noon time. After about 20 minutes right off the marina it seemed to be moving north towards the Narrows Bridge. It surfaced and blew air about 5 or 6 times. I've attached a couple cell phone pictures. -Thanks, Sarah Cazier

Amanda Gardiner saw
1 or 2 minke whales about 3.5 miles SW of Smith Island
, off NW Whidbey Island.

Entry 11:
Puget Sound -
2:12 p.m.
- We received a distant video of cetacean reported as Minke whale or Harbor Porpoise
between Edmonds Pier and Ferry dock
. -Spotted by Kai Frazier, Reported by Kari Morgan Frazier
(
Viewing the video of this animal surfacing close to shore, it
looks like a bottlenose dolphin
based on size comparison to humans on the beach and her/his surface behavior. Definitely not porpoise or minke - Alisa
)
