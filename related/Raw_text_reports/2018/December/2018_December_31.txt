Entry 3:
December 31st as I was out on the water that day. We went to watch the
T124As and the T124Ds
down near
Smith Island
in Washington. They were traveling slowing to the N/NW and taking very long dives - the two groups being separate at first before joining about 40 minutes later.
As we were heading back into Victoria Harbour we came across the southern residents (J Pod) passing through to the west.
In the sunset we were lucky enough to have a visit from
J-26(Mike) and J-39 (Mako)
before heading into the harbour. All current regulatory measures were taken and we did not spend much time with the southern residents. -Elizabeth Zwamborn, MSc

Five Star Whale Watch Facebook VIDEO of
J pod off Victoria
this evening...."we had pretty much
all of Jpod plus L87
stretched across the waterfront. The two Orcas in this video are
J27 "Blackberry" and J47 "Notch", plus J38 Cookie
was nearby". - ...The blows turned out to be from J pod and the whales were heading south on the
Canadian side of Haro Strait, south of Kelp Reefs
. Nearly all of J pod was grouped up and sleepily heading toward Cadboro Point on Vancouver Island. Not everyone was sleepy though.
L87 and J47 were goofing off together, as were J38, J39, and J45
. The
J16s and J46 were socializing
a few hundred yards to the west of the big group. To the east of the big group were
J17 and J53. Unfortunately, J17 has not improved
in health and showing a true peanuthead now. Perhaps reacting to their mother's condition, both J35 and J53 were acting mopey... See full encounter report w/photos & video at: Center for Whale Research Encounter 111.

Entry 5:
Admiralty Inlet - T124A2s & T124Ds
- Just wanted to share some photos and words from
December 31st as I was out on the water that day. We went to watch the T124As and the T124Ds down near Smith Island in Washington. They were traveling slowing to the N/NW and taking very long dives - the two groups being separate at first before joining about 40 minutes later...The photos below are of the T124A2s. All photos were taken with a telephoto lens and cropped. -All the best, Elizabeth Zwamborn MSc
