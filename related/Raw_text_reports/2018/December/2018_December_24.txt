Entry 4:

This
gray whale
crossed Saratoga Passage from assumably the
Langley
area. Once it got near shoreline, it headed north to Pebble Beach, where we were lucky to be standing at the point. We first saw it at
11:00 am, and watched it travel back to Langley from Pebble. It rested there for about an hour before heading south. -Peg Boley
