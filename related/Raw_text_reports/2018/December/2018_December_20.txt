We were sitting at our computers around

3:30
this afternoon when looking out our window, Eilene spotted what she thought was
a blow from a whale
close in to the shore across the street. Using binoculars, we were able to confirm this and believe it was a gray whale. It stayed close to the same location for 5 - 10 minutes before swimming off toward the west along the promenade. You can see in several of the photos below how close this whale was to the beach. It would be nice if this guy hangs around in the area so we can take a look tomorrow in better weather - but hope he keeps his distance from the shore. -David & Eilene Hutchinson
