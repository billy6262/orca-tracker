Perfect timing today - two large dorsal fins came into view as we arrived at Robinson Beach,
Mutiny Bay
, early this
afternoon
, with other
members of J and K pods
not far behind. The northbound whales were moving fast, and we needed to do the same to catch up with them at Bush Point. A group of six or seven orcas stopped to forage briefly with a few tail-slaps and a couple of spy-hops, while one or two others created flying foam following a breach. Against the backdrop of the snow-capped Olympic mountains, as always the sheer magnificence of the Southern Residents was a spectacular sight to behold.

have passed
