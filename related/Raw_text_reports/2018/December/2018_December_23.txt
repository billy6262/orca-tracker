Orca Sightings for December 23, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:30 - Gray whale
(reported as Humpback) in
Portage Canal, between Indian Island and the mainland
(Port Townsend/Jefferson County). It was milling at first, then seemed to be headed N toward Pt. Townsend....48 1.5 N 122 44 W. He said it was "crusty" and I thought maybe a gray, but he said they saw the pec fin and it was long and narrow. He got some photos so hopefully we will get those to confirm. -Tim Callister
