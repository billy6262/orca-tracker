Orca Sightings for December 21, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
...The first whales that we confirmed were
CA174
and her newest offspring. We then confirmed one of the bulls in the slightly northern group as
CA166
and then watched
T049A1
porpoise to catch up with CA174 and her offspring. We saw
T049A3, CA173, U083 and U084
. They came together to prey share what we suspected a seal from the behaviour, and smell after they finished it off (48 15.7/123 45.3)....Mark Malleson and Joe Zelweitro, See full report with photos at Center For Whale Research Encounter 108.

ID notes by Alisa Schulman-Janiger: "The unnamed calf that Mark saw on 30 Nov is very very likely the same one that Paul saw on 21 Dec: same fin size and shape, same saddle shape and margin shading."
