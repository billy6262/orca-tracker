(
orcas
) They all committed to
Admiralty
. They were spread out at that time and traveling quickly, cutting over at Possession Pt and Scatchet Head - to
midchannel between S Whidbey and Point No Point
. They continued NB and then grouped up - we counted 8 including 4 males breaching and tail lobbing in front of Double Bluff before continuing N and spreading out again - we lost sight as they started to cross in front of Mutiny Bay. This was all between
4 pm -
4:30ish
Total watch time from N of Edmonds to Mutiny Bay was about 40 mins. -Donna Van Renselaar

Donna and I are seeing male and a couple others east of
Point No Point
mid channel traveling northbound
towards Mukilteo
sort of at Olympic View Dr, north of Edmonds at a good clip pretty far out so no photos. Unknown if they are committed to Possession or Admiralty at this point. -Becky Newell Woodworth

Gray whale observed near Mannette bridge in Bremerton!
Spotted from our living room in Spyglass apartments! The spout caught our eye then we watched it go under, seeing its dorsal fin/ridges and fluke. The whale was moving north further into Dyes Inlet. The sighting was shortly before

"We have one small solo whale, maybe
a minke or small grey headed north in rich passage
!! Just now passing the channel marker near point Glover" More after some questions: "Couldn't see a dorsal, it was across the channel. Did get to see the tail. It was dark on top, light on under side" -Colleen Coleman

Entry 10:
gray whale
I've never seen before (Left dorsal ridge of
gray whale CRC2246
). I attached some photos for you. It wasn't coming out of the water very high while it was feeding in the
Snohomish River Delta
around high tide (mid afternoon) on both Nov 30 2018, and Dec 1 2018. Seen from Chilkat Express on 12/30, and MV Saratoga on 12/1. This whale appears to be small. Let me know if you find a match for it. -Thanks, Bart Rulon, Naturalist Puget Sound Express
