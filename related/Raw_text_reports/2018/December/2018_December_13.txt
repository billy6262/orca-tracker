15:25 - J pod
is currently just south of
West Point, Discovery Park
. They have moved off shore and are east of mid channel. Still grouped up, but now getting lost in the rain as they move slowly north. From West Point.

14:30 -
After beautiful grouped close pass at Alki,
J pod
now north of Alki traveling northbound outer edge of
Elliot Bay
a bit more spread out with some aiming a little west. Disappearing in the mist with a breach. ( After looking through photos we could confirm this pass was just
part of J pod
, big boys J26, J27, L87 and others may have been trailing far behind or gone wide to the west)

14:11 -
Beautiful close pass off Alki by
J pod
. We ran quickly down to the beach still on south side of the point...Many inverted tail lobs, rolls, spyhops, spypeeps as they moved north.

14:03 -
Large part of the pod at least is tightly grouped in resting. Just south of
Constellation Park, Alki
. Very much on West Seattle side! Steady slow northbound, all cuddled together. A curious Steller sea lion watches J49, J40 & others off Alki......J41 Eclipse surfaces next to an inverted male......has
J39 Mako

13:30 - Some of the orcas have grouped up more with at least group of 6-8 right in Ferry lanes out from Fauntleroy. Steady northbound. Think that is lead group. One male trailing by approx. 5 minutes, he is furhter west, closer to mid channel. From Lincoln Park, south side.

12:45 -
Moved to north side of
Three Tree Point
: residents spread out heading steady northbound. Trailers of at least four (believe J16s) on east side of channel, now just north of Three Tree Point about 15 minutes behind leaders. At least 16 whales. Leaders were just east of mid channel with others trailing in groups of 1-3s some same track, others more east with that trailing group much closer to mainland side. All steady northbound with 2 of those trailers hauling, half porpoising to catch up to male and female.

12:28 -
Seeing two groups so far, female in lead with few others trailing, with 2nd group short distance behind, northbound. All east of mid channel at south side Three Tree Point. Breaches and rolls, pec slaps. From Three Tree Point, Burien. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Hi, I saw
2 orcas
just off the pier in
Des Moines
. I was in my apartment and saw a splash, then a orca jumped half way out of the water and another one was next to it. I drove down to the pier but didn't see them again. -Vicki Jordan

Saw them back at the
