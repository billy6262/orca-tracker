15:32 - T124A2s and T124Ds now northbound in Colvos Passage.
12/30 on the Chilkat Express was an amazing double-header with two different pods of Transient Killer Whales. We started out down south with the
T124A2s and T124Ds
as they hunted pinnipeds in Colvos Passage. We suspect that the seal(s) in question were attempting to hide under boats, including our own since this group approached us not once, but twice. Both close passes came right before some intense action and then feeding behavior shown by both the orcas and some nearby birds looking for leftovers. (Disclaimer: Both close encounters were on the orcas' terms. We and the other vessels on scene were watching from over 200 yards away when the whales turned and approached us. Engines were shut down.) Later, we met up with the T46s as they cruised south against the tide in Admiralty Inlet.
T124D and T124A2B, T124A2, T124D2 & T124D1.

15:29 - Orcas
. Directly across from
Cove Beach Vashon
hugging the west side of Colvos - still northbound - research boat following them. -Patricia Caughell
*

15:21 - Orcas
. We see them! Lots of blows, maybe 5 animals? Way out on the
WEST side of Colvos, just south of Fern Cove
. There's a little 2-man research boat trailing them. -Cheryl Richmond
*

14:45 - Orcas
are swimming crazy fast, now along West side of
Colvos, Anderson Point, Kitsap

13:54 -
At Al's store in Ollalla. Pod, we think
5-6, swimming North in Colvos
, East side of channel. Lots of spray, circular and vigorous swimming!!! Huge jumps and splashes. -Kathleen Cage
*
Transient pics (below) as they were headed
north up Colvos Passage
this afternoon as seen from the shores of Vashon island. Erratic, stealthy behavior as they cris-crossed the channel, taking long dives, and popping up where you'd least suspect. Sneaky T's! I couldn't tell if it was the sunlight reflection, it's very possible, but it almost looked like the young calf in the pod had some very unusual pigmentation on the back of its body...from the dorsal to the fluke, looked very light....Would love to get some Id's if you get a chance!
T124A2s & T124Ds Colvos Passage.

12:27 - Orcas
have committed to
Colvos
. Out of my sight now. Great breaches just before they left. Boats were a good distance behind.

There was milling, direction changes. Now they (orcas) look to be heading
towards Colvos
.

12:01 - Orcas
past the
point (Defiance)
traveling in a tight
group of 5-6
. Looked to be turning towards Owen Beach. Don't see any males/tall dorsals.

are now well
north of Salmon Beach
. Heading towards Point Defiance faster pace now.

11:46 - Orcas
are slowly trending north, close to
Salmon Beach side
. Very active, lots of splashing so I'd agree they are on a kill. Hard to count from here but I'd say
5+
.
