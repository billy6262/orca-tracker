15:15 - (orca)
From
south end of Maury
I have two groups and perhaps a single leader
heading into Commencement Bay
. Light coming from behind them makes spray a lot more visible. Spreading out a bit even in the last couple of minutes. -Gil Martin

Some approaching the Channel Marker, some on the Vashon side of it. Slowly northbound. This is my last post for the day.. good luck everyone!

They have been foraging in this area (
between S Maury and Brow Pt

spread out crossing
Quartermaster
NE bound, looks like they may be going back up channel along Maury Island. Breaches & tail slaps.

Mostly circling and feeding off of Point Defiance pointing North but not really going anywhere. -Justine Buckmaster

Watched from
Vashon Island View Point
on 5 mile drive for about 15 minutes, just milling around and a few tail splashes. -2 Photos by Amber Stanfill, Dec 5, 2018

a pod over by Gig Harbor
. -Chuck Messinger

12:48 -
3-4 different groupings.
Vashon Viewpoint
(at 5 Mile Drive, Pt Defiance) mid channel. -Laureen Claggett
*

12:51 - orcas
are now all passed
Point Defiance
, more tightly grouped heading slowly north westerly towards Colvos, slowly being the operative word.

12:45 - orcas
are now all hanging right at the point at
Point Defiance
, been there for about five minutes.

12:37 - (orca)
picking up speed. The three at the head of the line are now past the point at
Point Defiance
. The three or four trailing are catching up.

12:24 - (orca)
I am at the Tahlequah ferry dock they are closer to the
Point Defiance
side basically just staying in the same area with a slight drift to the west. -Laurie Hare
*

12:59 (orca)
milling off
Dalco
viewpoint mid channel, hunting, drifting towards Colvos Passage.

12:41 - orcas are off Vashon Viewpoint
(1st viewpoint on 5 Mile). Can just see them through Trees at Dalco viewpoint...Open saddle for sure!

12:30 - (orca)
at least 6 in the lead, & 4 trailing. Think I saw an open saddle on one of the males. West of Ferry line now still westbound mid channel is for leaders, who are entering Dalco proper.

12:19 - orcas
are lazily drifting, West of the
Vashon Ferry terminal
, Westbound, looks like a resting line now. (from Owen Beach). -Melissa Burke

12:02 - (orca)
A group heading west. Appear to be right in front of Vashon ferry dock. Tahlequah.

11:38 - (orca)
I'm watching them from Maury. They're right off
Pt. Defiance Park
. They seem pretty close in. Big splash 30 seconds ago. -Gil Martin
*

11:28 - (orca)
I can see dorsals & splashes from
Gig Harbor
. Very far away from here. Definitely east of the ferry line. About mid channel between Pt Defiance & Vashon. From my Vantage Point I saw a large dorsal N of Browns Point Lighthouse. -Heidi Armstrong
*

10:45 - (orca)
I just counted 7, maybe 8 south of
Maury Is
. heading towards Pt. Defiance. Lots of surfacing. Sorry, didn't notice (if open saddles -alb). Saw plenty of dorsals and backs but nothing distinguishing. -Randy DeWulf
*

10:39 - Orcas
off the south end of
Maury h
eading toward Pt. Defiance. 5 or 6 best I can tell. Traveling SW. -Gil Martin

09:15 - (orca)
a couple multiple breaches off
Brown's Point lighthouse
park area. I saw
at least 7-8
individuals slowly headed north on the inside of Vashon past Brown's Point towards Dash Point and presumably continuing north...I wasn't able to see saddle patches. They were too far away. They were pretty dispersed with at least 3 mature males. -Erin Stehr
*

09:15 - (orca)
They have moved over to by Brown's Point Lighthouse Park. Anyone seeing them there?

08:54 - (orca)
May be on the north side of the bay near the
Brown's Point
Marina now. I am passing on second hand info (from project monitors -alb), but trying to keep you up to date. Anyone near Brown's Point? They may come by the Lighthouse if they head north. We don't know if they are Ts or SR.

08:42 - (orca)
Last report was up to 8 individuals with multiple breaches occurring. They are in the mouth of Commencement Bay... about 15 minutes ago.

08:00 -
We've spotted a male and female Orca in that area, probably Ts (
was
J pod/L87
- alb
), but please post if they are spotted again. I am being told there are 4 to 5 milling and heading north. -Brad Thiele, Northwest Environmental Consulting

07:45 -
I was watching from the
Point Defiance Marina. At least 3 orca
, 2 female and one male between Dash Point and Tahlequah at about
7:45...they looked meandering...they were slowly heading north. -Kaelee Schoenneman

07:45 -
Something breached several times at about
7:45a in between
Vashon and Pt. Defiance Marina
. I was too far away to see what kind, but saw two huge breaches. -Kimberly Arentzen Rau
*

Entry 4:
4:38pm, 1 male and 1 female orca reported off Canoe Island (bet. Shaw & N. Lopez)
, southbound. Must be some of the pod Florian reported earlier, though he thought they were residents and they only are reporting two orcas.
*
Just got a call at

11:40 am
from Florian Graner, he was on the ferry to Orcas Island, leaving
Shaw Island
he saw a bunch of
Resident orcas
spread out and milling between Decatour & Lopez Islands, possibly heading toward Orcas Island. He was too far to get any IDs, but said there was salmon fishing going on in the area, and with the number and behavior of orcas he was sure it was Rs.

HUMPBACK WHALES -

Entry 5:
Humpback Whale just off of Kingston
who was actively feeding with a large group of California Sea Lions. After looking through the catalog, I still haven't found an ID for this whale, so any help is appreciated! We continued south after a report of orcas near Tacoma. It turned out to be J Pod! They were being extremely social and we saw several tight groups tail lobbing, spy hopping, breaching, and more! It was one of those days where I didn't take as many photos as I probably
*
should
*
have because I was just so in awe of what I was seeing. Luckily, I didn't entirely forget to snap a few shots. -Justine Buckmaster

GRAY WHALES -

Entry 7:
Gray whale in Liberty Bay in the morning and downtown Seattle in afternoon
.
*

Entry 8:
14:45 - (gray whale)
Still hanging out in south
Elliott Bay
. Saw it surface a few times. Seemed to be going east. No sign of leaving the bay. -Troy Hightower
*

14:18 -
Surfacing and diving repeatedly in the bay to within 160m of the ferry terminal. Initially sighted just east of Luna Park at
2:04 moving east. Making approx 6 minute dives during my observation. Last sighted near ferry terminal at
2:18.

4:06 - Alisa, I have a
gray whale
downtown approx 1000m from
Colman dock
, just dove facing NW @ 1406. -Paula von Weller
*

Entry 9:
09:33 - Whales in Liberty Bay in Poulsbo
. Looks like Grey's. They must be eating something mid-bay - they've been diving there all morning. No dorsal like an orca, but a long dark back. Tail may be dark top/white bottom. Several blows every 7-20 minutes. After some questions by ON: May be the same whale just blowing several times? I saw it first at
9:00, still blowing at
9:40. So hard to see from here. Definitely a smaller whale, but I'd have to
guess that it's a gray
. That's also the word around town. -Molly Apel
