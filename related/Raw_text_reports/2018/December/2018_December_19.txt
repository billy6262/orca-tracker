Orca Sightings for December 19, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
When we first arrived we thought there were 3, but then we could only see
T65A2 and T49A2
(who I initially thought was 65A3). Later looked at photos and confirmed it was T49A2. -Renee Beitzel

12/19 on Saratoga, we were treated to a very special close encounter. We first spotted
two Transient Killer Whales, T65A2 and T49A2.
tucked in between several small islands on the east side of
San Juan Channel
. We watched from a respectful distance, engines shut down as they cruised west in 'stealth mode' likely looking for food. They were moving slowly, barely breaking the surface to breathe as they listened in all directions for seals or porpoises nearby. After a long down time, they suddenly appeared just a few yards off our bow and headed right toward us! Such a humbling moment when the ocean's apex predator decides to pay us such a close visit, seemingly just as curious about us and we are about them.

14:02 - (orcas) Now SE bound in San Juan Channel
close to Yellow Island.

13:26 - (orcas) Slowly W bound between Reef Is and McConnell Is
. Generally pointed at Jones. -Justine Buckmaster

Hello, I couldn't see who they were, but today Dec 19,
11:45 am, there were
at least two orca
just about 30 yards off the rocks just west of the
Orcas ferry terminal
. Just behind the county project rehabbing the old fuel storage area. A ferry from Anacortes was disembarking vehicles at the time. I saw them from the front door of the Orcas village store. There was tail-slapping, and one came at least half-out of the water doing so. Fishing? -Ken Carrasco

10:39 - Two orcas
on right side of Friday harbor ferry almost to Friday harbor, still
between orcas and other island
. Ferry confirmed sighting...My kids say "eastbound? We were headed out of Anacortes towards Friday harbor, almost there but the whales were headed straight back up our path away from us. -Shannon Mitchell
(
based on later reports/IDs this would be
T65A2
)

Entry 2:
09:00 -
Hi, I'm brand new to the Orca Network. I live in sight of
Bellingham Bay
. I'm pretty certain I just saw
about 5 Orca
with a male in the bay. I was using a telescope from my window. I live off Eldridge in Bellingham. I thought they were seals at first, but then I saw a big fin. Can anyone confirm? The sighting was at about
9:00am
December 19th...It looked like they were headed Northwest. I saw them about 1/2 way between the marina and the island. Sorry I can't be more specific...my geography is suspect at best. Pretty exciting nonetheless! -Jeremy Larsen
