Entry 3:
T100's
from AM tour ...Smokey Skies and not knowing how far west they went...we did our best but did not find them...but we were surprised to find
10+ humpback whales feeding on herring bait balls around Jordan River
. We knew other transients (
T137A & mom T137, T137D and all T137s
) were milling off
Sooke
waters in the traffic lane so we had a quick visit and enjoyed flat calm seas and ride home only a few minutes to our docks. -Paul Pudwell

Entry 6:
Langley, where we found gray whale #2234
, who has been spotted several times over recent weeks! We looked on as he fed in shallow waters, rolling and swimming sideways, to get his mouth full of tasty food! Along todays trip though the Pass, we also saw several porpoise and seals swimming here and there. -Amy W., Mystic Sea
