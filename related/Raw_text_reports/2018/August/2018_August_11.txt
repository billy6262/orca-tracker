Entry 2:
1407, J35
vigorously chased a school of salmon with her pod-mates in
mid-Haro Strait in front of the Center for Whale Research
for a half mile - no longer carrying the deceased baby that she had carried for at least seventeen days and 1,000 miles. Her tour of grief is now over and her behavior is remarkably frisky. Telephoto digital images taken from shore show that this mother whale appears to be in good physical condition (no evidence of "peanut-head") following her record-setting ordeal. There had been reports from brief sightings by whale-watchers two days ago that
J35 (Tahlequah) was not pushing the calf carcass in Georgia Strait near Vancouver, BC; and, now we can confirm that she definitely has abandoned it
. The carcass has probably sunk to the bottom of these inland marine waters of the Salish Sea, and researchers may not get a chance to examine it for necropsy. -Center for Whale Research

J50/Scarlet and J35/Tahlequah Updates
8/11: The team spent several hours with
J50 / Scarlet
on Saturday (8/11), watching her behavior and interaction
with members of J pod
. Researchers from University of Washington observed her swimming with the pod while trying to collect a fecal sample. Later the response team watched her fall as much as 1 kilometer (~1/2 mile) behind against a strong tidal current. Biologists were concerned that they did not see her eat, even in a prime foraging area off San Juan Island. A charter company reported seeing her catch a fish earlier in the day, and we are following up to find out more. Center for Whale Research confirmed
J35/Tahlequah is no longer carrying the calf
and appears to be in good condition.

13:52 - J50 and J35
are here. Couldn't tell about calf.
J50 tight with family
. Didn't see all of J Pod, not sure if we missed some or they're not all here. Fecal boat trailing the 16s but distant. Second happy sight of the day:
J35 Tahlequah
in the middle of a tight, playful, social group of whales, no longer carrying her deceased calf. -Monika Wieland Shields

I was on San Juan Island on 8/11 at the
Land Bank pullout just a bit south of Lime Kiln. About
1:30 pm J pod came through
. They were quite spread out and took about an hour to move from south to north along the coast. I believe Mike was bringing up the rear with two females and J50. ID notes: Looks like
J46, J51,& J49 - Haro Strait, L87 Onyx off the west side.
. -Sara Frey

14:17 - Past lime kiln now. 20-25. Only one large male that I saw. Some breaching, tail lobs. Not sure I can post or send pics till tomorrow. Amazing quite spread out.

13:23 - More coming!

13:18 -
I see them, just
south of Lime Kiln
, a couple ahead of main group. From Land Bank. -Sara Frey

d trending North.

Saturday Aug 11 trip report - on an overcast day, we headed out towards Colville Island to check on the many harbor seals hauled out on the rocks, then had a quick rendezvous with the Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks, and continued towards S
almon Bank to view some of our Southern Resident orcas....J-pod
was reported in the area, very spread out, and slowly heading towards the San Juan Island shoreline. We had distant views of the J16s (including J50 Scarlet traveling with mom), and several other Jpod members, including
J39 Mako
who circled our boat - successfully fishing - good news!! A few bald eagles and glimpses of harbor porpoise rounded out the day - with some much needed rain! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
Part of the J16s - J16 Slick (est born in 1972), mom to J50 Scarlet (born 2014), and J26 Mike (born 1991).

Entry 4:
20:15-

21:15 -
Saturday. We watched and listened to them from our beach as they
headed north in Eld Inlet
, along the eastern shore. What started out as late dusk turned to total darkness as they slowly made their way with surfaces, blows and simple breathing into
the center of the channel between Edgewater Beach and Boston Harbor
. Then they disappeared. -Kim Merriman
*

19:00 -

20:30 - 4 Orcas (appeared 2 M, 1F, & poss calf), Sunset Beach/Green cove area of Eld Inlet
. Traveling, feeding and some play, definitely traveling in search of food. Possibly scared down into our Inlet by Jet Skiiers and Boats. Jet Skiers left after we started yelling at them...They (orcas) were within an 1/8th mile of our Bulkhead. Fed and cruised around in front of our place for about 1 hour, then headed back North....tide was high at a approximately 15.7 tide. Majestic, many breaches and we could hear them breathe. SO AMAZING! -Tom Bean

17:40 -

18:30 -
We went out in our boat where we found them once more near the
south end of Harstine Island
. From about
5:40 to
6:30 we followed them along the south end of Harstine while doing our best to keep our distance and telling other boaters to do the same. Unfortunately, we turned back before we could see whether they went up Pickering Passage or down one of the inlets. -Connor O'Brien
*

18:12- Passed Johnson Point
, southeast bound. We're on the beach, on the
southeast end of Harstine Island
.

18:05 - Orcas, now heading south through Dana Passage
towards Johnson Point.

17:58 - Orcas, heading east toward the Nisqually Reach.

17:00 - orcas (3 with 1 large)
have been in front of my house an hour.
About 2 Miles north of Joemma Beach in Case Inlet

Hi! Just wanted to mention that we saw
two orcas, at the beach of the Sequalitchew Creek Trail (Dupont)
...they headed south together. -Catrina Miller
*

12:00 heading up Pickering passage.

11:30 six splashing south of Stretch island
. We're watching them from Harstine island. May be heading south? -Liz Wolk
*

11:27 -
I've been watching from the
north end of Harstine
for the last hour or so. They came by very close to shore with lots of breaches and tail-lobs. Easily the best orca encounter I've ever had. Now they are slowly southbound mid channel between the north end of Harstine and Key Peninsula.
T46 and family - north end Harstine Island this morning.

11:15 - Pickering Passage
between Grapeview & the north end of Hartstene Island. Boat was stopped as we knew there were
orcas
in the area. They approached the boat and gave our visitors from Michigan quite a thrill. Our 2 yr old twin nephews especially loved the "black whales". -Cammy Malm LaRiviere
*

11:04 - Large group of orcas (6 I think) rolling around between the north point of Harstine
. Lots of breaching and slapping. Watching from the shore for the last hour. At least two big males. -Cindy Faker
*

11:00 - Orca Sighting Grapeview, Stretch Island
. a pod of approximately 6 or 7. Believe we saw 2 babies. Playing, then traveling south. -Timothy Gero
*

10:18 - I spotted at least 3 orcas north of Herron Island mid channel between Harstine and the mainland northbound
. Presumably the
T46s and T137s
from yesterday. -Connor O'Brien
