Orca Sightings for August 26, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
~ Northbound out of Post Office Bay (Next to Parks Bay),
Shaw Island in San Juan channel

Entry 2:
(
T65A3 and T65A4
confirmed by Sara Hysong-Shimazu
)
*

17:19 - Orcas
passing Point Caution now southbound. Further from shore, but still on San Juan side.

16:37 - Ok at Point Caution
. I see the boats still quite a ways north. Haven't seen the whales yet, but a harbor seal popped his head up and looked at me so I warned him. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network
(
T65A3 and T65A4
continued north in
Haro Strait then took Mosquito Pass
, went east through Spieden Channel, then turned south
down San Juan Channel
where Cindy Hansen caught up with them off Point Caution, after that they flipped and
headed northbound again along the Shaw shoreline
(see above reports by Cindy and Bryn) - alb
)

Interestingly, for the second year in a row,
T65A3 and T65A4
, a young brother-sister pair, have broken off from the rest of their family group for at least several days. This afternoon the two of them passed close to shore off
Lime Kiln heading north
. Unlike in residents, transients sometimes see both male and female dispersal from their mother's family group, but usually it happens with older whales. T65A3 is 11 years old, and T65A4 is 7. -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 3:
19:44 -
They are directly in front of the oil docks now in about 200 feet of water. We saw 3 both times, 1 baby we think.

19:40 -
just spotted the orcas again just
south of Edmonds
just before the oil docks.

17:43 - Three Orcas
spotted off
Possession Point (Whidbey)
heading across to Point No Point (Kitsap), right now. One looks like a baby but not sure. Really looked like a direct line from Possession to Point No Point, maybe slightly more north. -Stephanie Hansen Hogenson
*
Noon -
I'm heading home. They have pushed more west out of my view. I dont think they've necessarily committed to Admiralty yet. They have not made it south of me and looks like they've trended slight north as well. Good luck out there!

11:40 -
still slowly southbound. Lead group is just about straight in front of
Ebeys Landing now
. Trailing group a mile? or so behind, appear to be headed south as well.

11:22 -
whales have split a bit. Theres a group further north with several boats. There's another group off
Ebeys Landing
with only one boat. -Rachel Haight

11:15 - T34
pod killed a seal so they are lagging behind.

10:52 -
looks like they have spread out to start hunting, still southbound on the Whidbey side - still off
Ebey
area.

10:34 - T30 pod, T37, T37B pod, And T34 pod
are the transients inbound now. -Bart Rulon, MV Saratoga
*

10:00 - orcas off of Ft. Ebey
, west Whidbey Island, in close slowly heading south. -Al Luneman

Entry 4:
11:00 -
I just wanted to report an
orca
sighting around

11:00 am
. We saw it off south beach on San Juan Island, just south of where
American Camp
ends. We saw the fin approximately 7-9 times. I think it was just one orca (which I know seems strange). -Kimberly Priestly

GRAY WHALES -

Entry 5:
0:54 - Small grey whale feeding in front of my house on Hidden Beach
. Shallow water. Not moving around much. -Liz Robbins
