Orca Sightings for August 10, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
During our Parks Canada evening wildlife talk at
East Point last night
(Friday,
August 10), just after
8 p.m. The Southern residents showed up
and we were treated to breaching, tail lobs and the beauty and wonder of these magnificent whales. I would estimate about 50 people in attendance at our talk, were lucky enough to be present when the whales came by. Unfortunately, I did not have a phone or camera with me but several others did, hopefully they will share anything with your organization. -Robert Bruce

10:30 am
on
August 10, a very spread out group of orcas went eastbound through
Active Pass

Entry 2:

09:50 - Orca
Sighting. We saw a
large pod of orcas (at least 18 or more) travelling between Galiano Mayne Islands
. We were on the
8:50am ferry, Salish Eagle, and has just left Sturdies Bay. Travelling, and some were playing or feeding. -Marielle Smith

J50/ Scarlet Update:
J Pod moved into Canadian waters on Friday (8/10)
, and the international response team followed. The team spotted J50 / Scarlet and watched as she repeatedly dove and surfaced where the pod was feeding. Biologists could not tell whether she also fed, but they collected leftover scale samples that will help identify what kind of salmon the whales had eaten. J50 / Scarlet again appeared active and energetic. The team also sighted
J35 / Tahlequah
, but could not confirm if she was still carrying her calf due to poor visibility. We will provide updates as the team continues this unprecedented effort to learn from and support J50 / Scarlet and her family.
J50 / Scarlet swims near Point Roberts, WA

Fri Aug 10 - Trip report - On another beautiful sunny day, we headed inter-island toward San Juan, where
Transient/Biggs whales
had been spotted. We found the whales -
T18s and T19s, near Flattop Island
, then watched them circle Gull Island - looking for lunch! The four whales leisurely traveled in the area, and we left them as they started to head across Boundary Pass, aiming towards Saturna/South Pender Islands. Homeward bound we checked out the (lucky) seals and bald eagles on Flattop Island, and again traveled between the spectacular islands to cap off another wonderful day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
