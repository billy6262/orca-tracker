, I saw
four orcas
--three females and one male. They were in the midst of what I believe was a bait ball. There was a large flock of frantic gulls and birds at the surface, and the orcas rose in the midst of them. They hung around there for 2-3 minutes, then dove, and I was unable to find them again. -Peter Wayne Moe
