Entry 6:
Humpback Comeback west of Sooke
continues! What a great morning visiting over 20 Gentle Giants today. I tried to get as many ID Fluke Shots as possible. A few I recognize but a new calf I believe. So little time, so many whales! Lighting, non-flukes, missed shots, fog, made it tricky but did my best! Stunning whale: underside fluke of
Humpback CS298 aka BCZ0366 "Caspian"
.
Humpback CS246 aka CRC-15995 "Lyra" Humpback who has been through some rough times: BCYUnk "Chop Saw"
. Always great to sea! -Paul Pudwell

Entry 7:
Pacific City, OR
. We saw some sort of whale species right off of Cape Kiwanda. The picture is the fin. In addition to the fin, we saw blows in the area. This was the only one we saw and it hung around for quite some time. The folks at the restaurant said humpbacks and grey whales hang out in the area, but is this the correct fin for one of those? I understand the picture is taken from a distance, but if anybody knows anything, it's you folks! -Ronda Barrow Hempler Probable gray whale feeding (fin tip) with birds watching from the bluff above. -Report by Rhond Hempler, Photo by Don Hempler, Aug 30, 2018
