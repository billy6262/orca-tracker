Orca Sightings for August 14, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
August 14th trip report - we headed out under foggy/smoky skies, towards
Colville Island
to check out the harbor seals, some with new pups, caught sight of a Steller sea lion swimming off
Iceberg Point
, found a few salmon jumping, and then located
Transient/Biggs killer whales, the T02Cs
!! A very special family group of
5 whales
(mom and her 4 offspring) - with a 13 year old male who has scoliosis, and a calf (T02C4) born in 2017. We had some great views of these whales as they headed towards Discovery Island (BC). The fog had lifted, some smoky haze remained but visibility at the water level was good. A few harbor porpoise and bald eagles were encountered on the return trip to port, a big thanks Capt. Eric for finding those special T's.
Family grouping - Mom T2C born 1989, T2C1 born 2002, T2C2 born 2005, T2C3 born 2011, and T2C4 born 2017. T2C2 known as "Tumbo". He has scoliosis. Orca families stay together for life, and his wonderful family waits for him, and helps feed him.

Entry 2:
20:07 - Orcas, just saw 4-6 individuals 100 yards off Point No Point
heading south. -Jake Carter
*

18:20 - Orcas mid channel possibly closer to Whidbey side passed southend of Lagoon Point
heading south. Hard to say how many but for sure two. -Marilyn Armbruster
*
1706: T100s (only 4) heading south into Admiralty Inlet at Partridge Point
. ...Keep an eye out for the 65As also! They were initially reported to be with T100's but when we arrived, it was only the 100's. Maybe they split initially and then followed up the rear if they are in Admiralty Inlet. When we left T100's southbound, just south of Partridge, they were nowhere in sight. (Update:
65As confirmed up north, NOT in Puget Sound.
