Today around
noon
, Aug 27th, I was fishing off
Young Island, in Burrows Bay, Fidalgo Island
and sighted
a single orca traveling west
. It broke the surface several times and made the distinctive noise from its blowhole. It was quite large, and I know the difference between orcas and porpoises. Is this not unusual to find one all alone? -Chip Treichel
