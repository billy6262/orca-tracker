Orca Sightings for August 8, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
NOAA Update:
J50/Scarlet
Update: Determined teams from Fisheries and Oceans Canada spotted Jpod again today (8/8), this time
in U.S. waters off the Olympic Peninsula northwest of Neah Bay, Wash
. They saw J50 with her mother, J16, also known as Slick. It was a bittersweet sighting for the teams to also see
J35, Tahlequah
, today, and witness the continued heartbreaking sight of her still carrying her dead calf, some two weeks since its birth. Our teams from NOAA Fisheries, DFO, and many other essential partners are ready to respond as soon as they are within range and conditions allow them to reach the pod and assess J50's condition. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast

18:30-

19:30 - A ton (literally and figuratively lol) of humpbacks in eastern Juan de Fuca Strait
yesterday evening (Aug 8). Between about

6:30 and
7:30
we watched around
five or six different animals
feeding, traveling, resting. This was just west of Victoria. I have one fluke shot. Only two opportunities to get any sort of fluke ID the whole time. As an aside, while ON gathered at Penn Cove and had a meditation moment at 6PM I concurrently visited the spot where Talequah gave birth to her daughter at Clover Point for a moment and offered a small token of flowers to pay my respects. Thanks to Maya's Legacy for offering me the opportunity to take a moment there. -Debbie Stewart
