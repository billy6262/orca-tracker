I saw them through binoculars from

Entry 3:
15:00-

15:45
- Watched who turned out to be
2 whales
(Marilyn spotted the 2nd blow well away from the inshore whale) who by behavior and lack of dorsal, look to be grays, off
north end Jetty Island
spread few hundred yards apart; one whale inside wooden channel marker closer to Jetty Island, directly
south of Priest Point, Tuallip
; 2nd whale just south of channel marker further offshore. Both foraging around In the muddy plumes of the Snohomish Delta while pod of harbor porpoise cruises south nearby. I would say grays; with confidence the inshore whale and probably both, but too distant to confirm 100% or for any IDs or photos. Inshore whale typical gray feeding behavior with a lot of birds swooping in. No dorsal present on either and no dives/flukes. Still in the same general areas when we left around
15:45. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
