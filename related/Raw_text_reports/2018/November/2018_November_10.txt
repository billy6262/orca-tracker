============================================================

Entry 1:
RESIDENT KILLER WHALES -
J pod/L87 - Admiralty Inlet
- Melisa, Tom, and Jane met at Snug Harbor and left the dock around
10:00 aboard "Morning Star". At

11:45
, "Morning Star" found L87 slowly heading north in Admiralty Inlet. He was in the shipping lanes
south of Double Bluff
, Whidbey Island...Full encounter report & images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 95.

Weather conditions on
November 10 were a bit more challenging with strong winds and confused seas as
J pod
meandered
slowly north in Admiralty Inlet
foraging along the way. After grouping up a little more, the leaders arrived at
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, mid-afternoon, before changing direction and heading south again - the leaders became the trailers, and vice versa. -Sandy Pollard

Some of the
orcas
are at least still a mile or so south of there, I finally just saw some blows up as far as Foulweather Bluff. They are so spread out, there may be some further N, but the group I'm watching has sort of stalled and is feeding a mile or so south of Bush Point, but still slowly heading N.

LOTS of breaching and lobtailing, slow travel, foraging behavior, and very spread out in choppy waters with sun glare, still slowly heading NW toward Bush Point. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

We were headed for JPod but it was going to be a long run. We came across these whales maybe 5 miles off the dock and spent quality time with them. Jack is my favorite Bigg's male and it had been awhile, so I was happy to see them.

I'm not from this area and I don't want to mislead anyone, but it appears the are large fins in the water headed towards
Purdy
. I could be mistaken but I do believe it is a bunch of whales more than 3 or 4. A lot of sea lions are making noise on the beach. Please if you can confirm, thank you. -Sue Hafner

orcas, perhaps 7 or 8
, off the NW corner of
