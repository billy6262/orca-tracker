Jeff Hogan took photos from the Alki lighthouse and only found members of
K pod
, including members of all the matrilines and
K25
, a 27-year old male who was reported not looking too good a few months ago. They were traveling at a good clip.

13:15-

14:45 -
I arrived to the south side of
Alki Point
at
13:15 where soon after I spotted the group of illuminated blows rising to the south off
Lincoln Park
. I then moved south and relocated to Lowman Beach were I watched this lovely tight group of
Ks
moving north on the east side of the channel at steady pace. K pod holds quite a presence with so many adult & sub adult male dorsals rising above the surface. I then headed north to the south end of Emma Schmitz along Beach Drive around
13:45 and watched with many others for ~ 15 minutes as Ks continued north still grouped in resting heading towards Alki Point.
Onward I traveled to south side of Alki (which was lined with dozens more humans) where I parked myself on the most westerly end of Constellation Park and watched Ks approach in choppy seas under moody skies. Ks reached
Alki Point about
14:20
, now loosely spread, then just as they would have disappeared around the point breach after breach by at least 4 individuals interspersed with some forward lunges, tail throws, pec slaps etc; Ks woke up it the most glorious and stunning visible way I'd witnessed. Bulls flanking and flying through the air all around the dwarfed skiff cradling researchers Mark and Maya Sears who were braving rough seas and cold temp. After Ks calmed their orca selves down, I moved to the north side of Alki to catch one last glimpse before heading home. At
14:38 they were north of the Point still continuing northbound, with some foraging and some more breaching along the way on the east side of channel along outer edge of Elliot Bay. We all paused, happily stunned at what had just unfolded before our brighter & now bigger little eyes. How completely heartwarming to see the whales and the faces of all the others, to share in that moment watching K pod wake up off that West Seattle point in Puget Sound. I listened to one woman who shared she was driving and pulled over then stood with another guy who shared it was his first time ever seeing orcas, imagine! One of the most memorable and deluxe encounters with these gigantic lovely beings. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

I never get to see breaches...Today I got to see about 20 in a row...With my friends, and my Heart to boot. All of
Kpod present. K21. K25 and K33
were grouped up at one point and all around the boat. Breach after breach....K33 in photo Taken from shore at Constellation Beach, Alki. Whales were about mid-channel NB towards Elliot Bay. Around
2:35 they started a breaching and tail slapping show. -Kersti Muul

Hi folks, What an amazing afternoon with our beautiful residents! A breachfest indeed-wonderful to see a double breach followed almost immediately by a third! Here are a few photos for you; I'm sure others will have wonderful photos to share as well. Thanks for all your good work,
K35 Sonata
, research boat, &
K33 Tika.

11:22 - (orcas)
they are slightly north of the
Marine View Park (Normandy Park)
. Still trending north on the eastern side but moving very slowly. They are almost out of my sight

11:05 - (orcas)
they are moving very very slowly and are all bunched up which makes me believe that perhaps they are resting? I think that there are between six and eight, it's hard to tell. And I think I've seen two larger dorsal fins.

10:54 -
I am watching the orca from 218th St. in
Normandy Park
. Looking straight out from the dead end of the street I can see the orca mid channel, but closer to the Eastside. They are moving slowly north. They are between 218 St. and the single radio tower on
Vashon
. My location is just slightly North of the Des Moines's fishing pier. -Tanya Esparza

I can see spouts off the south end of Vashon, south of
Point Robinson
