Entry 4:
OR Coast
- Hi there, We spotted a pod of orcas off
North Pointe, north of Depoe Bay OR at 4pm to almost
4:30 pm.
We are staying in a condo there, on the second story, so we are about 35 to 40 ft above the water. The weather was unusually sunny and warm, and the swell was incredibly calm. I spotted them several hundred yards off the coastline. The sun was just right that their dorsal fins were very distinctive and dark, sillouetted against the lighter grey-blue water. There were at least five adults, one definitely a male. There were two that seemed to be mother and calf, they were surfacing in tandem. I was watching through binoculars so could not see what they we're hunting, but they definitely were circling, lunging, and jumped out of the water two times, and the birds were circling and darting down to the water's surface. They did this for 10 to 15 minutes, then continued to circle much more slowly as the birds began to settle on the water. The pod then made their way South past the outer bouy that is at the edge of the bay. Because they were so far out, their markings we're almost impossible to see. they barely had any sort of markings round their eyes, and we could not see the white of their underbelly until one jumped completely out of the water. Three or four times, just before they started heading south, one or another would rise out of the water nose first, spyhopping, and I could see the white of their throats. I hope this is the sort of information you are looking for. -Holly Marley

15:45 -
Langley Whale Center Just got a call from a guy in
Depoe Bay, OR
(didn't get his name-sorry) to report sighting of a group of
transients
just now. He said there were
5-7 orcas
, including a "very large" male and said they looked like they had just made a kill. Orcas were about 1/4 mile offshore. He said there was also a gray whale about 200 yards offshore. Wish I had gotten his name-if he sees this, maybe he could leave a name in comments. -Sharon Anne Clark

Entry 5:
15:30 - Possible humpback off President Point
, south of Kingston, Kitsap side. Feeding beneath a large flock of birds. No direction of travel. -Joanne Graves
*
GRAY WHALES -

Entry 6:
16:30 -
I have been watching it again for the past 2 hours. It is sticking close to
Cooper Point
spit and slightly north and south of it. It ventures into
Eld
a bit. Then crosses the spit and ventures into
Budd
. Lots of surface activity - spy hops, tail throws, and pec slaps. It is often followed closely by the sea lions. The whale surfaces, and then so too do they, 3-4 at a time. It's as if they are 'no its heels'. It's wild. I missed the breach a few minutes ago. And the breach just now with Mt. Rainer in the background and the moon rising above that. :( What a gorgeous pink hue to water and sky. -Kim Merriman

14:10 - Eld Inlet saw the gray whale
in front of Flap Jack. It surfaced twice and did one tail throw. It was moving north out of the inlet. -Sharesse Fowler
*

12:26 - Gray whale (CRC 2234) at Cooper Point
spit shallows and immediate area (
Budd and Eld inlets
) this morning for several hours. Last seen heading north east toward Boston Harbor and Dana Passage. Very active - with surfacing series, spy hops, and tail throws. Very robust blows, too. Those are rafting sea lions behind it. They have all been hanging out in the same area. Sights and sounds on Sunday morning deep in the southern end of Puget Sound. Gray whale 2234's early morning visit to Cooper Point (Budd/Eld inlets) while it surfaced, spy hopped, threw its tail - all the while traveling back and forth along the sand spit itself. It was joined by a whole lot of sea lions. Everyone exhaling at the same time. Then some barking. Synchronicity on full display. Such grace. -Kim Merriman
