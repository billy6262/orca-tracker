GRAY WHALES -

Entry 5:
Gray whale CRC-2234 surfaces off Cooper Point, Olympia.
Fog so thick all I could do was hear sea lion barking and then....just like that... the HUGE exhalation of
the gray whale
. It was close to the tip of Cooper Point, Eld Inlet side. The fog lifted just enough to allow me to see one super clear surfacing series. Then it traveled back and forth along this side of the spit. Here are a handful of images I could get while shooting in super thick fog. I was even able to capture a couple of its friends. At times I couldn't see...but I could hear! So. Very. Grateful. -Kim Merriman
