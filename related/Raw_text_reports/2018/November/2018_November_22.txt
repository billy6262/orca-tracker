Entry 2:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -
SJI Westside Orca
Sighting 11-22-18 at

3:23pm
. From the shore I was watching the waves zoom past to the NW when I was startled and thrilled to see orcas fins cut above the waves. I saw 4 for sure (maybe 5) orcas zoom past me traveling to the SS/E towards and past Hannah Heights. They were moving fast and only surfaced briefly 5 times. There was one large male out ahead and a very tight group of three (possibly 4) following. This group included one very tiny dorsal fin. All the best, little one. May your family hunt with fortune. My camera was not at the ready but I managed one quick photo of the male,

Entry 5:
Hood Canal -
I'm a Midwesterner new to observing marine life, so I'm not sure if it was an orca I just saw at
Scenic Beach State Park in Seabeck
. Whatever it was had a black fin and seemed to be alone. My first sighting! It was more curved, like the middle or top left (in reference to photos provide indicating most like Lags & bottlenose dorsal) and seemed fairly small, but I had nothing to compare it to, so who knows. I didn't get to see any of the body. Birds kept attacking it every time the dorsal fin came out of the water so I think it kept going back under pretty quick to avoid them. -Melissa Mason
