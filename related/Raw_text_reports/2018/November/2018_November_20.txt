Last time I saw it was around
2:00. Same place.

13:15 -
closer to mid channel, still south and west of the yellow buoy

12:10 - Whale off President Point
, not an orca. South of Kingston, Kitsap side. South and west of yellow buoy channel marker. Maybe grey? Seems small for humpback. Could be the humpback that has been hanging out here the past week. Slowly trending south. -Joanne Grave

16:20 - Gray whale
right off shore saltwater state park and spotted one orca headed north right along the east side of Vashon Island (No way it was a dolphin. This thing was as big as a vw bus). -Alexander Simenstad

I had a friend say they were on
Ruston
having lunch and saw a single orca around
