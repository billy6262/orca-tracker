Hi there! There appears to be
one member of the Southern Residents
hanging out in
Paradise Cove
(Colvos Passage). We've had a ton of fishermen out here over the last two weeks, so I Imagine it's for the salmon. I believe I saw this member last week as well, do not appear to be any others with it. Definitely looks too big to be a dolphin, the dorsel fin is extremely tall, and it did come out of the water - although it was too far too identify markings. The channel is quite deep, but they are in an area that does get shallow quickly. They stayed in the cove for about 30 minutes, between
8:15a to
8:45. Hope this is helpful! -Kallie Sandstrom
