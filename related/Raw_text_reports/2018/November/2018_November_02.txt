15:15 -
we left the
orcas
to go to Deception Pass then spotted them again
north of Harrington Lagoon headed toward Penn Cove
. -Bart Rulon, Chilkat Express

13:05 -
Watched the
Transient Biggs orcas (T46's) from Fox Spit
briefly as they moved fast through choppy waters and winds north. ...I was wind blown and sea sprayed! Hopefully the Whidbey Island northenders will see them...as I left them, they were heading north, but looking like more so on Camano Island side of mid channel. Keep an eye out for later and tomorrow around the island. -Marilyn Armbruster

13:00 - T46s still northbound between Fox Spit
(Whidbey) and Elger Bay (Camano) spread out a bit mid channel. T46D is trailing behind.

Chilkat has the
T46 pod northbound at Sandy Point
(Whidbey). -Bart Rulon, Chilkat Express

...on the Chilkat Express was a very windy, very choppy day. That didn't stop us or the whales! We found the
T46s in Saratoga Passage
heading quickly north, stopping once to feed, then powering north through the waves again. It was a beautiful sight to see. Definitely worth getting a little seasick for. -Justine Buckmaster
