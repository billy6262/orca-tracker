Viewed from Sunset Park in Ballard. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

Here's another picture from yesterday afternoon from around

4:10
when a trailing group also passed by northbound close to
Discovery Park
after the leading group had done so already. Yesterday's encounter was a short but sweet one, especially since I haven't had very many opportunities to see the resident orcas.

15:58 - seeing 4-5 move north from Discovery and others milling off West Point. Breaching orca at
4:06 this afternoon. This happened a couple hundred yards north of West Point. -Photo by Connor O'Brien, Nov 4, 2018

Shilshole Bay at
2:30
. Two adults and a very small baby. Tug and barge separated them for a bit, but then they started heading closer to one another. Not sure if they caught up to each other. We didn't want to follow too close. Hope they are okay. -Kari Pendray

watching a group of several orcas including bull north end of

and NE of there. Some close in Bainbridge others further offshore well west of mid channel. See blows, dorsal, surface action, directional changes. Some further south, all trending southbound. From Richmond Beach, too far for IDs or numbers. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

*

10:48 -
I can still see 2 big males
foraging just south of Point Jefferson, mid channel
.

10:20 -
they are starting to leave my field of view but I'm pretty sure the

I can see them straight out from
Marina Beach (Edmonds) still slowly southbound
, closer to the Kitsap side. At least 2 males so far and at least 7 females/juveniles. They're too far for me to positively ID, but I think these
might actually be Residents

Entry 3:
T46s & T46Cs - ~

16:00
- We observed for about 30 minutes a pod of
5-6 orcas
. They hung closely together and I am sure there was a juvenile....very tiny dorsal fin. They were traveling south. Also yesterday, on
November 4, my friend on the other side of the island near
Yeomalt Point
observed two pods traveling north (one mid channel -- the other closer to shore) in the morning.....not sure exactly what time. Exciting!!! From home on Olympus Beach Road, Bainbridge (at head of Fletcher Bay (not end but top), facing Brownsville). -Jane Rein
*

15:05 - Just saw Orca on Liberty Bay
. -Alicia Cuvertino
*

15:00 - T46s & T46Cs in Liberty Bay, Poulsbo,
There was a pod swimming in
Liberty Bay
just off Virginia Point, we have some video. Looks like a baby orca was part of the pod. -Lena Hunt
*
Orcas in
Liberty Bay
this afternoon! Saw at least 5, with at least 1 little one. -Claire Ward
*

12:15 -
Just now, heading through
Agate Pass
, 4 younger orca traveling south. -Kari Pendray
*
Noon - orcas/killer whales
sighting today from
Agate Point
headed west through Agate pass. 4 - 6 moving though the Pass with incoming today at noon!!! -David Campbell
*
Starting at

11:30 am Fay Bainbridge - at least 6 orcas
including at least one male with very tall skinny dorsal NB and then turning West/Northwest around Point Monroe toward
Port Madison/Agate Pass Bridge
. Not super clear, but photo attached is one of the females as they turned the Point around Hedley Spit/Point Monroe (I suspect these were Transients). Went up to Suquamish Tribal Dock around

12:45-
1:00pm but lost them. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
(
Based on time, location & direction of travel looks like these two reports below would be the group of Bigg's - alb
)
*
Just had a report from Susan Marie Andersson, of a large group that she is pretty sure is the
J pod group who were seen from Fay Bainbridge Park
, but they flipped and headed north toward Port Madison at
11:45. They went out of her view but she is hoping to relocate and confirm that it is Js, but due to large pod size and a male that looked like L87, it sounds like maybe Js are now headed north.
*

11:30 -
watching from Bainbridge Island at
Fay Bainbridge Park
, I would guess
6-8 Orca
swam past us at about 100 yards. SUPER EXCITING! We originally spotted them at Rolling Bay about 30 minutes prior, about 11am. Fins seem to be SRKW's! One large bull. And maybe a sprouter? Large dorsal is very wavy as it swam away from us heading north. Only short video I got. Sorry. We were so excited and sharing the enthusiasm with others on the shore. It is a magical day in the PNW! -Kimberly Sylvester
*

09:46 -
Just got a report of an
orca pod south of Manchester
, possibly heading toward Vashon ferry. I haven't seen them personally. -Fletcher Sandbeck
*
Saw
orcas today (Sunday Nov 4) between 9 and
9:30 am between Blake Island and Manchester Fuel Dock
. I saw from Cornell Road in South Colby. Appeared to be just a few but one male (tall fin). Appeared to be feeding. -Alice Houge
*

08:00 -
got a report of orcas in
Colvos Passage
near Cove road heading north. -Kelly Burns Keenan
*

Entry 4:
humpback off Point Jefferson, Kingston
, Puget Sound.This is totally NOT a good photo...it was almost dark and I was shooting with my big lens, but I thought since it shows so distinctly the bottom of the flukes that maybe someone can give a name to this beautiful creature that was out front at dusk. This one came from the south and hung around our place (
Point Jefferson, Kingston
) for a bit before meandering north. -Chris Beamer Otterson
*
