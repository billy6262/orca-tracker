BIG BIG NEWS.
All 3 Southern Resident Pods are off of Race Rocks
having a greeting ceremony. It's a big deal. -Puget Sound Express

Today was a tale of two stories. On the one hand, we learned that young
J50 - Scarlett
- one of the younger members of the SRKW
J-Pod -
was
declared dead
by researcher Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research. On the other hand (and perhaps related??) -
virtually ALL members of all three of the SRKW pods - J, K, and L pods - came together for a rare "greeting ceremony" just off of Race Rocks
south of Vancouver Island. It was the first time in 2018 we've seen all SRKW pods together. It was incredibly moving, and by luck, we had BHT Films with us to capture some footage. -Puget Sound Express

SUPERPOD!
One of the only times this year that almost all of the Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales
J, L & K Pod
came together his morning.
J's came from the east, K's from the west and L's from the south
to interact near
Race Rocks Lighthouse
...WOW what sight! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

We had a nice encounter with
L47
. She was with another whale, I have to identify, that did several dorsal fin slaps, breached several times and added a tail slap to almost every surfacing. -Alison Engle
