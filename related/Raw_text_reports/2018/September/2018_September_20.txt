Orca Sightings for September 20, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
All the whales seemed to be between
Hannah Heights and Eagle Point
and were heading slowly north before some whales stalled out and began foraging. We saw
K21
in a vigorous salmon chase off
False Bay
before he charged offshore for some more foraging. Earlier, we had seen a group of about
ten or so Pacific white-sided dolphins
streaking north not far off Kanaka Bay. A bit later, we saw them again a little inshore of where K21 was chasing his fish, fast traveling south again. They did not seem interested in playing in boat wake like they sometimes do but they stayed in the general area of the whales while the encounter lasted. Full report: Center for Whale Research Encounter number 82.

Incredible sail with so much wildlife. Orcas from
K pod and L pod, Pacific white sided dolphins
, seals, sea lions, loons, bald eagles, diving birds, great blue herons... The orcas were engaged in lots of fishing
off Eagle Pt
. as well as some kiddie cuddle puddles. Oh and lets not leave out the incredible vocals! -Barbara Howitt

There are two kinds of dolphins in this photo. Fun day watching
Pacific White-sided Dolphins interact with K pod
! I believe this is
K38 "Comet"
, correct me if I'm wrong. (I hardly have seen Ks or Ls lately.) Also, we watched a lag nail a salmon today near the SRKWs! -Traci Walter

On Thursday 9/20 (about

10:20am
) my wife and I saw a large group of dispersed
orca
near the
southwest side of Moresby Island
(southern Canadian Gulf Islands). Difficult to count them all but probably 10-15...some were feeding near shore, some were more mid-channel (including a large male), and some were making large circles around the boat. They were all slowly heading north. Magnificent animals and always a thrill to see them! -Steve Liedle

12:01pm -
1:00pm
; At the western-most edge of
Hannah Hts
I observed
15-18 orca
including 5-6 lg males traveling to the NW towards Edwards Point. There was a group of 3 and two groups of 2 traveling closely together. I recognized a few
members of L & K Pods
. Some of the members continued past Edwards Point but at
12:20pm the second half changed direction back to the S & SE, zig-zagging back and forth moving away from the island and then continued on again to the SE along Hannah Hts. At
12:30 I observed an adult & youngster,
L103 "Lapis" and L123 "Lazuli"
. At
12:38pm, I saw one male breaching and I believe it was
K34, "Cali"
, showing his beautiful swirl of a saddle patch. I loved seeing the little one keeping up with Mom. -Michelline Halliday

Entry 2:
4 killer whales
and then heard calling for about another 30 minutes just a few minutes ago. This is my first time even seeing whales (just moved here) so cannot be sure but the sound was a repeated sound with occasional responses that came from 2 different directions. I thought killer whales could only be heard underwater so furiously searching to confirm it was them. Very moving. -Dyan Marie in Spirit Bay, located between Sooke and Metchosin

Well, we had the time of our lives in the afternoon
near Deception Pass
. On approach to the area we saw a whale watch boat hanging out. There were a group of,
I think, 5 orcas feeding
. We turned off our boat and enjoyed the spectacle from the proper distance away. After 5-10 minutes the whales turned north and headed straight towards us and went right under our boat. There was a male with a smaller whale and a group of three that were kind of hanging out together. -L Boucher
