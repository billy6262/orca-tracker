Orca Sightings for September 25, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:05 AM - Haro Strait/Juan de Fuca
- Haro Strait
between Point Edwards and Hannah Hts.
It was still dark when I heard the exhalations. I ran outside as the whales passed, traveling quickly to the SE. The full moon was obscured. So I listened. In the dark. There must have been
many whales
because I could hear an exhalation every 2 seconds for 5 minutes. The moon came out from behind a cloud and I could just make out the last 2 members that had passed by. Orcas! -Michelline Halliday

9:45 -
We were sailing in our 30 foot sailboat headed south with
Smith Island to our west
in the straits around
9:45 in the morning and we saw
three orcas
, one larger and two smaller. Don't think the larger was a male as the fin was not overly large. They were swimming at the surface heading south, submerging and then reimerging from the water over a period of ten minutes. They surfaced about 150 yards from our boat. We powered down and headed away from them so as not to interfere. After they disappeared from sight we waited a bit longer and then started back on our course only to see them within minutes now off our starboard bow, having gone to our other side and then disappearing for good. Such a gift to get to see them out there. We were heading back
to Port Townsend from Lopez Island
. Later fog came in. -Amy Kolve

5 orcas at eastern bank at

in small spread out groups, mostly traveling steadily SB w/ medium pace, occasionally pausing to forage off the Point. They ranged from 100 yards out to Kitsap side of mid channel. Observed tail slaps, others saw a spy hop. - Donna Green Van Renselaar
*
Twenty-four hours after the
T137s
headed north from
Bush Point, J pod Southern Residents entered Admiralty Inlet and passed Bush Point heading south
. The orcas, resplendent against the backdrop of the Olympic mountains, continued beyond Maxwelton towards Possession as the sun set behind the jagged peaks. Three words came to mind as we watched the rise and fall of dorsal fins traveling in a steady procession in their constant search for food - "May they survive." -Sandra Pollard
