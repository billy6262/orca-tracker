Orca Sightings for September 26, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod Admiralty Inlet - Started our day with
J Pod
spread out across
Admiralty Inlet
! All whalewise guidelines were followed. J pod was actively foraging, breaching, cartwheeling, spy hops...
J27 Blackberry
was the big breacher of the day! We went on to Protection Island and then headed back to the Inlet. We found J pod just about to enter the Strait, with a minke whale in front of them doing it's best to get away! It obviously did not know they are fish eaters! -Janine Harles
*
What a thrill to see
members of J-pod travel close to Whidbey Island's west side
today.....
J16s, 17s, 22s
and possibly some of the
14s
were spotted. Awesome!! -Jill Hein

10:55 - J Pod at Bush Point
. Spread out and foraging, but trending north. -Justine Buckmaster

11 am: J pod off Bush Pt.
- when we arrived they were really intently hunting, sending up huge sprays of water along the surface as they raced for prey. -Barbara Mundell
*

11:08 - Two orcas off Bush Pt.
slowly heading north, one breach; then at
11:10 there were five orcas, close in and foraging, more breaching. -Bessie Julie
*

11:05 -

11:30
- This trip north by members of
J pod
looked very different from their trip south on Sept. 25. Then they were all business, traveling south in procession, mostly in groups, without surface action or changes of direction. Their return trip north was with enthusiasm, with lots of circling back, breaches and rollovers. I watched beginning at
11:05 AM from just south of Bush Point, and then from the lighthouse, they were spread out for miles singly or in small groups, moving unpredictably in all directions but trending north for about 30 minutes. The photo appears to be J27. -Howard Garrett

12:40 just south of Pt Townsend

2:00 pm see them from Libbey Beach
out a mile or so from
Ebey State Park heaing north
.

2:25 angling out
a bit more north westerly.

2:30 pm at least 3 miles out
and there are a few boats with them.

2:45 pm can barely see them with binocs from Libbey Beach
, just little black dots. Still heading northwesterly and out of range. -Marilyn Armbruster

Sept. 26,
9:25pm -
9:40pm, Haro Strait, SJI. In the dark! Orcas heard traveling to the NW from the westernmost edge of Hannah Hts towards and beyond Edwards Point. I imagined I could hear 4 distinct exhalations so I'm guessing 4-5 individuals (?) They were present when I first heard them so I could have caught the tail end of their passage. I ran to start up the LK hydrophone hearing the first voice at
9:59pm and the last at
10:08pm. I recorded it and have attached an 8 minute audio file of their communications. It's such a gift to have access to the hydrophones. Thanks to everyone who makes it possible! -Michelline Halliday
