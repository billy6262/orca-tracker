Orca Sightings for September 29, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed up through the San Juan Islands, with reports of
Transient (Biggs) Orcas in San Juan Channel
. We caught up with the
T65A
family, who we've seen a lot this season. The matriarch is
T65A (b. 1986), her son T65A2 (b. 2004), T65A3, son (b. 2007), T65A4, daughter (b.2011), and baby T65A6 (b. 4/2018)
. Don't know if 2014 calf, T65A5 was with them. They were close in to the Shaw Island side, and slowly made their way south west from Friday Harbor (San Juan Island). They were mostly traveling, with a few tail slaps along the way. Lovely to see this "resident" Transient group! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist (all images zoomed and cropped)
