Orca Sightings for September 9, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Js & Ls. And Ts!
- The
Lime Kiln hydrophones
were very busy today. Early in the morning
J and L Pod whales went down island
...in the a
fternoon they began coming back up
. At about

1:00 pm their calls started to be heard...that continued until after
5:00 pm
. Somewhere during that long afternoon vocal and visual encounter,
Transient calls started over the hydrophones at the same time that J and L Pod calls were
...totally cool! Not common to hear them both at the same time...does not have anything to do with them being in the same vicinity...only that the hydrophones were picking up their calls...the rain and misty sky didn't help in attempting to locate them. Then this evening at about

8:00pm more Transient calls over the Lime Kiln
hydrophones...It was a very busy day indeed! -Jeanne Hyde

15:21 - Whales off Possession Head
trending towards Possession Sound. With so many whales around Whidbey over the weekend, it was hard to keep track of them. After seeing the T18 and T19s on Saturday in Saratoga Passage on the east side of Whidbey Island, we watched more orcas power past
Lagoon Point
on Sunday close to the west side of Whidbey before moving on to the next shoreline base, Bush Point, followed by Robinson Beach, Maxwelton and,
finally, Possession Shores
. Convinced they were heading east we staked out the Possession boat ramp with other dedicated Orca Dorks Marilyn Armbruster, Durand Dace and Dori Dace in the howling (but fortunately warm) wind - and soon realized we'd been skunked! -Sandra Pollard
