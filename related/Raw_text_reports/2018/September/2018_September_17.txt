Orca Sightings for September 17, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait
, San Juan Island. From the shore between

9:49am ~
11:30am
I observed
at least 19 orcas including 4 big males
traveling to the W/NW from
Hannah Hts past Edwards Point
. All these orca were traveling quickly and basically in a single line following a beautiful dark blue strip of choppy water that stretched across my entire view. Their dark blue highway didn't quite follow the shore and when approaching Edwards Point flowed out to the west which took the orcas farther out westerly away from the shore along Western Preserve. I was able to identify
J27 Blackberry
which just made my entire day! -Michelline Halliday
*
Long string of
Orcas traveling north on west side of San Juan island at Eagle Cove.
9:00am
. At least a dozen. Unknown if they were SRKWs or transients. Two or three trailers stopped to feed. The others continued north, spaced out, single file. Boats were very respectful. It took about 45 mins for them all to pass. I'm so happy I got to see them! -Lisa Carry

Reporting a sighting of
approx 13 Orca off of South Beach on San Juan Island
, They were spread out with about 2 - 3 nautical miles of separation moving to the north. They were a ways off the beach, No Binoculars or camera available, but lots of Breaching activity, moving thru the fishing boats. I work for the National Park Service on SJI National Historic Park. -Phil Ziegler

So happy to find
J-Pod, out by Stuart Island
. A beautifully calm day, with beautiful whales. -Jill Hein

Entry 2:
1 Male and 4 female Bigg's orca
, 1 mile south of
Marrowstone Island
, pointed at Bush Point 1230 -Christopher Hanke
*
I think I saw this same group around

5:40pm at Point no point
. They looked like they were just playing/eating/flapping for about 20 minutes, before they headed south. -Whitney Gabrielle

Entry 3:
Juan de Fuca
-Gary Sutton
*
Humpbacks near Pillar Point
on the afternoon of

Entry 4:
*
The Saratoga had
2 Humpbacks just off Possession Bank
, "Two Spot" and "Uluka" -Justine Buckmaster
*
GRAY WHALES -

Entry 5:
18:00
- I'm seeing blows (one large whale, likely
gray
) from the Rucker Hill neighborhood looking over the navy ships across towards
Mission Beach/Tulalip
. There were areas of "dirty" water behind it, like mud plumes and it was definitely in a known gray whale spot. It was windy on the water however I don't think the blows were nearly tall enough to have been from a humpback. Even with known humpback sightings in the area I still say it was most likely a gray whale - Amy Willoughby

DOLPHINS/PORPOISE -

Entry 6:
20 Pacific white sided dolphins
on our sailing adventure today. -Barbara Howitt
*
Pacific White Sided dolphins
riding our bow wave today. Such fun loving creatures, can't help but feel that elevated playful joy when with them. They like to roll over and make eye contact to connect. -David Howitt
