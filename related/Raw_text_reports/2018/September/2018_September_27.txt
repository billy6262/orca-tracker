We had a
big gray whale feeding in very shallow water between Spee-Be-Dah and Tulalip Bay
today from . Not normal to see them this time of year. I expect it's on its way South and stopped off to feed. - Margie Eliason
(
We have had two "new" grays this year that arrived last spring along with our usual N. Puget Sound grays, and they both stayed very late into the season. We have had reports of one of these still in the area recently, after also spending a little bit of time in South Puget Sound. This is something we have never seen happen before - to have a whale stay this long in our area - it will be interesting to see if it ever leaves or just decides to be a year round resident! -Susan Berta
