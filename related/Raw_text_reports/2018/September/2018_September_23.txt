Orcas and Humpbacks
. Together!
Haro Strait, SJI
. Observed & filmed from shore between the westernmost edge of Hannah Hts and Point Edwards.

2:01pm -
6:30pm
At first the orcas traveled to the nw towards Edwards Point with some doubling back, some moved away from the island, soon they traveled in all directions stretching as far as I could see. At

5:39pm 5 orcas with youngster in tow passed Edwards Point
, moved towards shore to the SE; spy hopping, rolling & splashing, The sun was in my eyes but I believe these were
members of L-Pod including L103 and her son, L123
. At
6pm a humpback traveling in the opposite direction
surfaced with a big-breath-roar within meters of the group just as the orcas approached Hannah Hts. -Michelline Halliday

We were fishing in the Everett Coho derby near the
Kingston ferry terminal about 8-
8:30
in the morning yesterday.
3 or 4 Orcas
maybe more surfaced within 50-100 feet of our boat. We immediately pulled our gear and shut everything down and watched them till they got a safe distance from us. It was an awesome sight being my first time in the wild to see them rolling and blowing air. One appeared much larger than the others with its big fin having a slight curl to it. They were headed south towards Seattle. The rest of the day we heard on the VHF radio other fisherman spotting the pod. The last report we heard was them showing up down by
Shilshoe
