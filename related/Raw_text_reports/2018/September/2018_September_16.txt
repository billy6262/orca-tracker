Orca Sightings for September 16, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands - K and L Pods
- With Island Adventures, encounters with
K&L pods
! -Lisa Egashira Archid√©
*
Haro Strait, SJI between Hannah Hts and Edwards Point
. From shore I observed orcas, very spread out, from

11:50 am ~ 5pm
. At first their travels were to the SE (down island) but some doubled back again soon enough. Eventually orcas were moving in all directions. The weather was as varied as their travel; sun, rain, calm seas & then chop. At mid-day during the light rain, I could see the exhalations in mist clouds above their heads all across the sea. At
4:45 pm a foursome went racing by (to the NW) smashing through the waves, water exploding around them. Very early evening there was a lovely communication on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. An empty tanker, the Nord Bosporus, went by drowning out the orcas. The orcas voices were quiet after it passed as I guess the orcas had moved on. I am including one photo taken from shore with a telephoto lens at
1:15pm. Identity unknown. -Michelline Halliday

Got them from sunset! Had a breach! They are moving fast heading south mid channel. -Kendall Berry
*
We saw
3 orca whales while taking the edmonds, kingston ferry sunday at
4:00
. -Sasha Lucas
*
We encountered them just past the
Edmonds ferry
dock about east of mid channel. They were travelling south, VERY spread out. We could see whales breaching all over, including the HB's that were just west of mid channel, same area. We were shut down, when
J41 and J51
approached the boat. J51 swam under then did a huge breach right next to the boat then did 5 or 6 more half breaches as Mom swam just a little in front of him. We left them once they moved on and went over to see Two Spot and his friend and then the double mugging happened!! All that not even 5 minutes off the dock! It was very rough out so only got a few pics of Residents. -Janine Harles
*
J27 +2 with us at Apple Tree and J37 +3 north of Edmonds
. I think there were several groups spread way out and across based on what we saw then what Ariel saw from Edmonds. At about

5:30
they were spread out all the way from
Discovery Park to Alki
with trailers probably even with Fay Bainbridge right after my last post... Like

5:30-6ish. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

17:37: Orcas
spotted
south of point wells
mid channel heading south. -Darlene Moneypenny

Seeing blows from
golden gardens
. Still north of me
1830
. West side of channel heading south. -Brandon Anderson
*

19:15 PM
. Just off
Point Jefferson, Kingston
mid channel....I saw the Victoria Clipper slow to a stop so that gave me a heads up that there was some kind of whale activity (I have seen them stop before so people can watch). At any rate....
half a dozen or maybe more orca
heading south at a good clip. Saw one of them breach. -Chris Beamer Otterson

one orca, north of Fort Worden off the lighthouse
, going back and forth between the red buoy/marker and a crab pot, out beyond the kelp bed but inside the marker, from
