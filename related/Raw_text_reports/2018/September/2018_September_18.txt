Orca Sightings for September 18, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -
"We spent most of that encounter just sitting and listening. We could hear them breaching farther away than we could see them and when we were lucky enough to have them pass us like when
K33 Tika
breached here we could hear their voices without dropping the hydrophone. They were all mixed together, socializing and there was just an energy on the water that evening that was truly magic." -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Entry 2:
J, K & most of L pod in San Juan Channel passing Friday Harbor
. We were all in awe and so happy to see them so social. They gave us a good reminder of why we work so hard to educate and promote recovery actions. -Jeff Friedman

59 members of the Southern Resident population of killer whales made their way down San Juan Channel
this evening. Some whales were spread out and actively foraging while others were in big, social groups. It's an uncommon travel route for them, and even more unusually for this location, some of the whales were right on the shoreline! Here's
J26 Mike
passing right off the rocks at the Friday Harbor Labs. -Monika Wieland Shields

Report from Center for Whale Research - Encounter #81 Full report - Sept 18, 2018 - The whales were spread out from the shorelines of
Waldron Island and Orcas Island
. As the whales on the Orcas Island side
approached Jones Island
at the bottom of President Channel, they turned southeast down San Juan Channel. The whales on the Waldron Island side became the trailers as they also turned southeast for SJ Channel.
K25
was the last whale we saw and he was trailing the other whales, looking skinny and a little lethargic. He was non-cooperative and surfacing irregularly so we let him go and ended the encounter with him heading slowly southeast down mid-SJ Channel at 1755.
*
We are dismayed and saddened at the news of another struggling Southern Resident orca and are hoping that K25 will make a full recovery. Please continue to follow the Center for Whale Research encounter reports and announcements for updated information about
K25's condition

8:08 am: Pod of Orcas off Lawana Beach, Whidbey Island
(Saratoga Passage, south of Penn Cove). Seem to be heading south but taking their time. Might be feeding. Three or four, definitely a male and a female with a smaller one at her side. -Randy Zimmerman Furnas
*

10:08 -
Saratoga has eyes on them just
north of Hidden Beach
, very close to Whidbey shore hunting.

10:30 -
They are southbound, right now at the mouth of
Holmes Harbor
. Still hunting along the way.

10:38 -
Now entering
Holmes Harbor
very slowly. Transients.
T137s
hunting seals. -Justine Buckmaster

They were awesome. Spy hopping, jumping tail and fin slapping. So cool to see them right from
Freeland Park
. -Mary Jane Sarbaugh
*

12:23 - Four Ts
, including one male, milling in
Holmes Harbor
near the moored boats, looking like they are heading back out toward Passage. -Allie Hudec
*
It's quite a treat when we have whales at the bottom of our garden, so to speak. The
T137's
paid a visit to
Holmes Harbor
today after being spotted off
Hidden Beach, Saratoga Passage
, before wending their way deep into the harbor where they spent some time hunting. There were a couple of dramatic breaches and cartwheels plus tail slaps and a spy-hop I didn't even know I'd caught on film. Although I didn't get down to the former Beachfire dock in time to see them cruise past the seals dozing there, I was told that as they did so one seal slipped into the water followed by the rest. Which leaves me wondering about the rationale of seals... -Sandra Pollard
