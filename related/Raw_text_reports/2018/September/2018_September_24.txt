Orca Sightings for September 24, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -
Orcas off Kingston
- This morning we had four beautiful orcas having breakfast in our backyard. Including the big male spy hopping right off our beach. I grabbed one phone shot as they swam Eastward. -Bob Towery
*

10:45 -
half dozen or more orca, one BIG one have been feeding on the
Kingston side of mid channel
for about a half hour....between Point Jefferson & President Point Kingston. They are now heading north again. -Chris Beamer Otterson
*

Entry 2:
16:22 -
just south of yellow marker across from
Bush Pt., possibly T137's
. - Richard Snowberger
*
It looks as though the
T137s
(we believe it was them) decided it was time to head out of
Admiralty Inlet
after a few days spent in the inland waters of Puget Sound. They cut the pace off
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, and spent a couple of hours to'ing and fro'ing north to south as they milled and foraged. If the five jet-propelled breaches we saw were anything to go by, their hunting strategy was probably successful. -Sandra Pollard

HUMPBACK WHALES -

Entry 3:
1 humpback at
2:35pm here today in Active Pass
by Georgina Lighthouse travelling south. -Melissa H.
*
UNCONFIRMED WHALES -

Entry 4:
Point No Point today around
1:30 pm
when we spotted
what we think was a solo orca
swimming north near the shore. We were not able to see any white on it, but it sure looked like an orca. It was a large mammal with a tall black fin. Seemed odd to see it alone which is why we are reporting it. -Karen Overstreet
