Orca Sightings for February 13, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - Below is a short summary of an encounter we had yesterday with some members of L pod that I thought you might be interested in. On
February 13th, researchers from Marine Ecology and Telemetry Research, in collaboration with Northwest Fisheries Science Center, Cascadia Research Collective and the US Navy, conducted a small boat
survey out of Westport, WA for Southern Resident
killer whales. Weather conditions were excellent, and
members of L pod were encountered north of Grays Harbor, WA
during the latter part of a 91 nautical mile survey effort. Identification photos were collected of the whales encountered, and foot print follows to facilitate collection of prey remains and fecal matter were conducted, though no samples were observed. Additional surveys will be conducted throughout the winter and spring, weather and logistical constraints allowing. "This little man is
