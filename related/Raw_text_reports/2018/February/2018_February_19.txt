sighting report called in from Nadja Baker from the
Ft. Ebey State Park bluff trail
, NW Whidbey Island:
Two orcas
, tight together in Admiralty Inlet, feeding in a rip line in front of me, about a mile off Whidbey in line with Discovery Island...WoW!!! What a Whale of a Whidbey Island day!!! Went to Fort Ebey State Park to picnic on the bluff trail and was rewarded for braving the arctic cold winds with a super surprise transient orca whales sighting in the Strait of Juan de Fuca!! Their bursting blows glistening in the gales and winter cold air temps caught my eye as they were traveling closely together southbound about a mile offshore. - Nadja Baker
