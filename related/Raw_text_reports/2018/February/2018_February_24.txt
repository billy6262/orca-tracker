This afternoon I got out on the water with Maya's Legacy and we met up with the
T124As (including T124A1) in San Juan Channel
. While they were in travel mode heading slowly north when we got on scene, they soon went on a killing spree. As they headed
into Upright Channel
we saw them make three consecutive kills, most likely of harbor seals. On all three occasions dozens of gulls came down to join the feeding frenzy. We left them milling near

5:30 PM at the bottom of Harney Channel
. Whale fix! I was thrilled to get out on the water this afternoon with the T124As in San Juan Channel. This is calf T124A6 (born 2016) with eyes wide open on a high surfacing between mom T124A (left/back) and sibling T124A3. -Monika Wieland Shields - Orca Behavior Institute
