Richmond Beach and Presidents Point, Kingston
while aboard ferry crossing to Edmonds. -Marilyn Armbruster

2:15 p.m -
Just saw them from the deck of the
Seattle to Bainbridge ferry
. It looked like there were three and they were headed North still on the west side (of channel) but traveling more to the center of the channel. And it was pretty neat because the huge harbor crane vessel just had passed, so the vessel was the backdrop to our pictures. GREAT experience. Loving our Puget Sound today. -Heather Strassell
