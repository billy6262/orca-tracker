Orca Sightings for February 26, 2018
============================================================

Entry 1:
While I was bird-watching from the
Edmonds Pier
on Monday, Feb 26, I spotted and photographed
a Gray Whale at
10:05am
. It was fairly close, just a few hundred yards southwest of the pier. It surfaced two more times before I lost sight of it. It was heading south. -Joe Sweeney
(
ID notes by Alie Perez, Cascadia Research: "This is another unknown animal, doesn't match the catalog. I don't think it is the left side of the gray seen on the 21st either."
)

Entry 2:
1 am
we both heard what we were pretty sure
sounded like a large whale spouting
, then heard a few other sounds (sort of like we used to hear when they fed below us on North Bluff rd), I wonder if the grays feed a bit along here (south of Bush Point), it is really sandy/muddy - I know they feed in Useless bay. Anyway, hoping it is a(nother?) Gray and someone sees and photographs it first thing! -Susan Berta, Orca Netwrok
