4:13 p.m -
Just saw whales from the inner Island ferry coming into Friday Harbor
about 6 to 8 of them
. They were milling and there were lots of gulls around. The ferry was booking it because it's running late so I didn't really get a direction. I would say they were probably close to the labs so heading out from Friday Harbor. -Peggy Mauro
