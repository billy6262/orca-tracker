============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound - T137s -
3:58 p.m. -
Midchannel male dorsal out from Mutiny Bay plus a few hugging Whidbey side
N end of Double Bluff
. They gathered right here off PNP with feeding behavior, but soon spread out as they moved on heading NE towards S Whidbey. At least 4 -- that was so cool to walk onto the beach and have a big ol' spy hop right in front of me!! Didn't even have camera ready yet.

3:35-
3:45 p.m. -
Eyes on - 100 yards out from
Point no Point
... big spy hop now traveling NE at good clip passing Double Bluff and heading to Mutiny Bay up Admiralty!
T137A
northbound in Admiralty Inlet off
Point No Point. T137D, T137A, & mom T137.
-Donna Van Renselaar

1:40 p.m. - passed Apple Tree Point Kingston, NB
steady pace. Several plus a male about 1/4 mile behind...Stinks to be home sick but for a few minutes of orca viewing, felt better! Pretty sure I saw one very young, one female, young male and an older male.
Matriarch T137 off Kingston...her big 16 year-old son T137A
. -Sara Frey

1:23 p.m. -
Pod is just on south side
Apple Cove Point, Kingston
heading towards row of home at Point. Male is on outside , maybe leading a bit, 1 female, 1 young and maybe 4th (female or juvie)? Still NB. Travel is slowish moving at surface but then 3-5 mintue dives they surface much further ahead than anticipated. Has made tracking them a bit more difficult than usual.

1:10 p.m. -
pod resumed travel and is about to surface in front of
Kingston dock steady northbound
West side of channel, loosely spread.

12:54 p.m. -
after long dive pod has moved far over to Kitsap side north of
Presidents Point
. Some surface action: tail lobs and maybe a spyhop.

12:35 p.m. -
This pod is stealthy. They were either on prey or flipped...last northbound same spot. I moved closer and haven't seen them again since about

12:20
.

12:12 p.m. -
May have stalled. They just made directional change and their location is actually mid channel between
Richmond Beach and Jefferson Head
.

12:05 p.m. -
After hours of searching...Finally found them. Pod is southbound steady pace just south of
Jefferson Head
just west of mid channel. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

At least
3 orcas including a large male off SW Possession headed south

Entry 2:
T87 (& presumably T124C, T124A2s)
. At

7:38pm
, a pod of
orcas came by Arcadia Point
westbound. I could not see them, but we could hear them. No pics, too dark. -Pamela S. Burger

I saw, 2 perhaps 3 (they were far away by the time I got there) Orca heading out past
Boston Harbor Marina
. Someone had posted on a neighborhood page that they were heading out past
Burfoot Park in Olympia @
4:45 at by
4:57
they were past the marina, heading out! -Brandee Crocker Kankaala

5:12 p.m. -
Done for the night. Lost them in the snow heading across from far shore and mid channel toward
Hunter Point
and Squaxin Island. Heading west toward Steamboat Island.

4:53 p.m. -
Now turned around and heading north still on far shore and now north of the marina. Slow and long dives with a few frolics thrown in by the little one

4:19 p.m. - They are in Budd Inlet heading south
. Slow surfacing series as they approach Boston Harbor. Very close to that shoreline. -Kim Merriman

Here is a VERY grainy image of both males from

8:30 this morning
as they were spotted south side of Squaxin Island heading west.
T87
and his pretty boy notch."

8:10 a.m -
I could see
at least 5
, at least two bulls. Heading west toward
Steamboat Island
, When I first saw them they were slow surfacing. Hardly any blows...they were doing slow surfacing and directional changes. (Prior to that...They were headed east in front of Squaxin toward Budd Inlet.) -Kim Merriman
*

7:45 a.m - Five orcas in Dana Passage, going south
! -Cora Tunberg Gray whale
*

Entry 3:
2:00 p.m. - Gray whale off Olympic Beach, Edmonds
. The whale was pretty close, about as close as the fishing pier, I first saw it half way between the ferry dock and the pier, I thought it was a log, then it disappeared so I knew it was a whale. It surfaced again closer to the pier so I thought it was traveling south, but the photo shows it turned around and was headed north. I went south to see if I could see it again but I didn't. No blow/spout. -LeRoy VanHee

ID notes: "This gray is definitely not one of the Sounders. I took it through our catalog and did not find a match." - Alie Perez, Cascadia Research
