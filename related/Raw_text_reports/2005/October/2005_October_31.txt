Orca Sightings for October 31, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went to S. Whidbey after hearing the
orcas
were headed NW, & found the orcas at
3 pm
after they passed Apple Cove Pt. heading toward Point No Point, close to the Kitsap Peninsula side. They were very spread out & far away, & if it weren't for one huge male fin (J1's I think) I wouldn't have spotted them. The visibility was deteriorating, & I couldn't find them again as I traveled further north up the island.
