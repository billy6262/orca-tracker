Orca Sightings for October 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Early afternoon brought the whales...very spread out. Apparently representatives of
all three pods
, but they were so spread it would have been next to impossible to say who was there. Of note there was a female in the first group being "harassed" by a large group of Dalls porpoise. Probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-20 porpoise were literally all over this individual whale and apparently had been since at least mid Stuart Island. They were traveling rapidly in all directions around the whale....easy to follow her direction and anticipate surfacings. Left the scene at
4:00pm with whales still trickling south from Stuart and the leaders south of Limekiln.

Patty Shanholter of Coupeville called to report a
gray
whale between Harrington & Race Lagoons, fairly close to shore - they had been watching it for 45 minutes.
