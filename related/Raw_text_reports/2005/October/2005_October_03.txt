Orca Sightings for October 3, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I caught up with several tight groups of
orcas
heading south close to shore at LandBank this morning at about

10:15 a.m
. It looked like there might be only about 20 whales. All of a sudden as the whales headed into the big rollers, they exploded into activity. They were breaching, tail-throwing, spy-hopping, and generally catapulting themselves into the air in every manner they could imagine. I have not seen so many of them out of the water at one time. In one several second period I must have seen at least 20 whales in the air. Frequently I saw at least five breaching at a time, as well as two to four spyhopping. The show lasted about 10 minutes at this level, then they calmed down to merely multiple breaches and spyhops. After about 20 minutes, they continued traveling south in two tight groups. There were at least a dozen whales fairly close to the shore. All the rest formed a horizontal line and headed southeast slightly more offshore, but not in a resting line. By
11:00 a.m. the whales were becoming difficult to see from land as they headed more offshore.
