Orca Sightings for October 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to relay a report of
orcas
sighted down south between Vashon & Fauntleroy this evening at around
6 pm
. He got out after dark so couldn't see them, but could hear them - they were first headed south, then bunching up & heading north, so possibly just milling around foraging - south of the Fauntleroy ferry dock.

I was surfing at 15th street reef at DelMar, San Diego at about 8am on Monday,
October 17, 2005. I was several hundred yards off-shore. Looking back toward the cliffs, I saw a small sized Orca jump clear out of the ocean and then though the whitewash of a broken wave. It was close to shore. By small, I mean 10+ft. It had the distinctive white underbelly and black top portion. Then off to its left, a fast racing shape could be seen catching another wave. When it turned and swam back out to sea, it too was an Orca. Looking south moments later, I saw several more large dorsal fins mingling around, more stationary than any dolphin pod I have ever seen and much larger - like the pictures of an Orca pod congregating.
