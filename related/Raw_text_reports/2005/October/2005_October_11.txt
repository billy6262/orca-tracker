Orca Sightings for October 11, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Scott & Val Veirs called to report they were monitoring vocalizations of
K pod
at False Bay, west San Juan Island at

8:20 pm
, & were also able to hear blows. At 7 pm, a subset of J, K & L pods was monitored heading S-SW from False Bay, between Pile Pt. & Eagle Pt; then turning & heading N-NE - location was 48 28.220 123 05.010. They heard some wheezing with the last set of blows (maybe J8?). They found these whales earlier in the day off the Partridge Pt. kelp bed, & followed them back to San Juan Island, along with Ken Balcomb of the Ctr. for Whale Research.

Terry Ann Dougherty called to report seeing the
orcas
yesterday from the Port Townsend Keystone Ferry at approx.

1:15 pm
. She said they were on the south side of the boat, she saw at least 10 of them, spread out & frolicking.
*
Ron Bates of the Marine Mammal Research Group called to report he was heading toward
orcas
reported off Partridge Pt, & hoped to reach them by approx. 11 am.
*
Ken Balcomb of the Ctr. for Whale Research was with the
orcas
off Partridge Pt, west Whidbey Island at

2:40 pm
- he was just arriving but believed he was seeing K pod whales.

I first received reports of
orcas
off west Whidbey at

9:30 am
, so charged out of the house to find them. I caught up with them at
9:45 am at Ft. Casey State Park, when they were just south of the park, in a long line from Marrowstone Island across Admiralty Inlet & into Admiralty Bay, all heading NW toward Ft. Casey. But by
10:30 am they had changed directions & headed SE toward the Peninsula side, still very spread out in mid-Inlet....by 11 am it was clear they were continuing SE & were close to the other side. I headed south & watched from Ledgewood Beach, & at about
11:30 am I found them south of Ft. Flagler, heading north again. I counted at the very least 20 whales, with at least 2 adult males (or sprouters), possibly 3. They were all close to the Marrowstone Isl. side, again too far for ID's or photos. By noon they were off the N tip of Marrowstone Island, still heading NW toward Port Townsend. At
12:20 pm some were near the Port Townsend Ferry dock, others were still back at Ft. Flagler - there were LOTS of whales, VERY spread out, making it difficult to get a good count - most heading NW, but some turning to head south. At
12:40 the leaders were NW of Port Townsend heading NW, one whale was headed SE, & there was more breaching going on in front of Port Townsend. At 1 pm, I went back to Fort Casey, where the whales were just south & closer to the Whidbey side, some in Admiralty Bay again. But by the time I got up to Fort Casey & set up my camera, the whales crossing Admiralty Bay did exactly what they had done 3 hours earlier - teased me by coming right toward me, then turning & heading back SE out of the Bay heading out across the inlet! I watched from Ft. Casey from 1 -
2:15 pm, & the whales seemed to be everywhere, but mostly on the far side of the Inlet, spread out from Ft. Flagler to Protection Island, then heading back across the strait toward Partridge Pt, though some looked like they might be heading out toward Victoria. Of course when I got home I received the call from Ken that they were off Partridge Pt.

John Herman reported seeing a
Minke
whale about 1 mile north of Fort Casey at around
1:30 pm.
*
Thought I would pass on a rare sighting of
Orcas
off Lagoon Point on Whidbey Island at approx.

8:30 am
. About 10 with a calf or two traveling North in the shipping lanes spread out about a mile, lots of action. We see them about once a year on this part of the island. Update at
9:25 am: The orcas were 1/2 way between Fort Casey & Pt. Wilson
