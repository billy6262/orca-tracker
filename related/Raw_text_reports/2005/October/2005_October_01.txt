Orca Sightings for October 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We got the heads up that
transients
were heading south in Swanson Channel from Mark "Mallard" Malleson. Katie and I found six transients heading south midstrait just south Turn Point at around 1800. They were T20, T21, T2, T2C, T2C1(?), and T2C2(?). The whales were very mellow and T2C1(?) and T20 were rolling around together. We stayed with them until just after sunset, before
1900
.

[This] afternoon we met up with
L Pod
In Haro Strait just off Eagle Point, San Juan Island. The pod was very spread out, with whales moving about singly, or in 2's and 3's. First L82 (Kasatka) surfaced just off the bow of the boat. On our way home, we had yet another surprise, as encounterd a large group of
Transients
in Swanson Channel, heading South. T20 was in the group, and it appeared the rest were the same group we had encountered on Sept 5, in the same area, but heading North that time. We had only a quick stop with this group, but it was long enough to determine that they had a new calf with them - small and orangey. If this is the same group from Sep 5, the calf was born since then.

We found
J's & K's
off the west side of San Juan Island, still heading north toward Hannah Heights at about

2:30 pm
. The whales headed out toward Hein Bank & played the disappearing act.

The
orcas
were reportedly off the west side of San Juan Island most of the afternoon. I caught them coming north off Pile Point at about

5:00 p.m
. J1 and J2 were leading. J2 was accompanied by a K or L pod female with a large opening in her saddle patch. When they got to Hannah Heights they slowed, and slowed further at LandBank. I'm not sure exactly who was there, but it appeared to be J and K pods and about half of the L's, if not more. L57 trailed the pack and did a couple of huge breaches about 1/4 mile off shore.
