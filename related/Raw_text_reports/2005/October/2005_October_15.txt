Orca Sightings for October 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
TIME:

4:00 PM until
7:00 PM
LOCATION: Latitude between 47.7N and 47.8N - Longitude between 122.4.W and 122.5W - Buoy south of Kingston Ferry terminal
VIEWING PLATFORM: Residence in Innis Arden (near Richmond Beach) Shoreline, WA using binoculars
NUMBER of
ORCAs
: Too many to get an accurate count.
We spotted several Orcas traveling south at noted location. They were traveling in what appeared to be the shipping lanes for the day (closer to the west shore of Puget Sound). There is a buoy in this location but I don't know its identification. It's just south of the Kingston ferry terminal. We first spotted the orcas at approx.
4:00 pm and we observed them in this area until
7:00 pm when it got too dark to see them any longer. I'm not an expert at gauging distance over water, but it's safe to say that at the least they stayed within a one to three square mile area for the better part of these 3 hours. They traveled south, lingered in the area, traveled north, then south again and so forth. We saw several breaches and lots of spouting. We assume they were feeding but were not close enough to determine that. We saw multiple sizes and at least one large fin. We think this was at least one of the resident pods if not all three of the southern resident pods. I recorded sightings of Orcas in this area on
October 3, 2004 approx.
5:15 pm,
January 9, 2005 approx.
11:00 am, and
January 16, 2005 at
2:00 pm. All three of those sightings were of a small group of approx. 5 - 9 orcas. We think they were transients.

We saw a group of
Orcas
porpoising in the east side of the shipping lanes across from President's Point at about

5:30 PM
. I counted about six animals, four that were close to the middle of shipping lanes and two appeared to be performing for a cruise ship closer to shore. The animals were moving north fairly quickly and appeared to be on a course for the East side of Whidbey Island. Approximate longitude: 122 degrees, 24 minutes - Approximate lattitude: 47 degrees, 22 minutes.

plus L57, 53, and 7 - same as other day. They were with them from about Point No Pt. down to a couple miles north of Shilshole (no. of Seattle) & left them at about
4 pm
.

Kendall Berry reported sighting the
orcas
from Edmonds, they were near Point No Point at approx.

1:50 pm
, heading south.

The
orcas
were still up just south of Lagoon Pt. at

8:50 am
. Headed back north to Lagoon Pt. to watch them heading south, watched from there until
9:15 am, then headed back to Bush Pt. When we got back to Bush Pt, we watched as they seemed to be heading from Lagoon Pt. across the Strait over toward Ft. Flagler (just like they did on Tuesday!), with many breaches off the Lagoon Pt. lighthouse. By 10 am the leaders were across from Bush Pt, closer to the Peninsula side. There were 2 adult males, one looked like J1 from a distance. Also saw a calf traveling with 2 juveniles, & Howie saw a seasnake on one of the adult males (I missed it - darn!). The two males were traveling together, sometimes surfacing & diving EXACTLY in sync with each other, their tall dorsals rising & falling back into the water in perfect timing. Lots of lunging, tail lobs, breaches, & foraging behavior going on. We watched from Bush Pt. as they continued to head south, very spread out, remaining closer to the Peninsula side, until 11 am, when they were nearing the SE end of the Strait & Pt. No Pt. Dave Ellifrit from the Center for Whale Research was on his way down to meet them, so hopefully we will get confirmation on the ID's. YIPPEE! our 3rd day with the whales this week!
