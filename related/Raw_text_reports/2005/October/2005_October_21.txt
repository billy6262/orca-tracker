Orca Sightings for October 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Scott Veirs of Beam Reach called in a report of
L pod
- they found the L11's around
11 am
, 2 miles SW of Victoria, heading NE across Haro Strait toward Salmon Bank. They looped south, and at sunset were 5 miles south of Cattle Pt. At 7 pm they were at Hein Bank - they followed them until 11 pm, listening to their calls on the hydrophone, where they were about 5 miles SE of Race Rocks, slowly heading west. The calls got fainter as they continued west toward Race - they spotted 8-10 whales in the pod.
