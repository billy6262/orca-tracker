1/2 mile off False Bay, west San Juan Island heading S-SE - they ID'd J1, L57, L7, L54, L79 & other L's, and a few more J's.

Yep---think the whales came back "home" to the San Juans today, with
orcas
milling at Deadman's Bay.

J pod
, and of course, L57, off Pile Pt heading north at

8:30 am
this morning. They got as far north as Lime Kiln before turning around and heading south. At
10:30 am they had made little progress against the flood tide and were spread out between Hannah Heights and Deadman Bay. Lots of foraging and a few good breaches. At one point J14 seemed to have babysitting duties for most the young 'uns. At
1:00 pm the reports had them at the same place.
