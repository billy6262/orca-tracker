Orca Sightings for January 27, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
7
Transients
off Victoria going west along the waterfront, first reported near Trial Island at
1124
. "Mallard" is going to launch his Zodiac at Pedder Bay and try to intercept around Race Rocks around 1500. It appeared to be T20 and friends. Hopefully "Mallard " will get some closer shots, they are in Pedder bay as I write.

I spent an hour before dark with the
transients
that came by Victoria's waterfront on Thursday off Pedder Bay. They were harassing steller sealions. There was no evidence of a kill but they certainly banged them around a fair bit. I left them at
1730
going through Race Pass west bound. T20 and 21 were there as well as T109 and 4 others perhaps part of the T109 group. Still working on ID's of the other 4.

Today I saw four
Orca
heading south down Hood canal at Eagle Creek at

3:20PM
. Then spotted the same pods (Orca and human) on the way home at about

4:30 PM
. They had only made it to Hoodsport by then. Still heading south.

We watched the
whales
in Hood Canal today beginning at Octopus Hole and continuing South past Hoodsport. We counted 5. It seems the whales were showing off for a group of people gathered on the Hoodsport dock. They came in close and milled around for about 10 minutes. The whales made a kill near that dock and left a bunch of leftovers for the birds. They were eating when we spotted them at Octopus Hole also. I suppose there will be some ID's soon as there were helicopters over head and lots of people along the highway.

It's been 2 years since I was lucky enough to hear
orca
blows, but tonight I was treated to the experience again! Just got in from an hour of listening. They were below our house on the west side of the Great Bend of Hood Canal. (Potlatch) at

7:25 pm
. I stood on Hwy 101 below our home (about a half-mile south of Hoodsport) and listened in the dusk for about 20 minutes. They should be in Lilliwaup or a little farther north by now (
7:45 pm) if they continued on their northward course.

South Hood canal - Dave Ellifrit (Transient Researcher from the Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island and me located the
whales
about
5.15pm
... almost dark. Our orca watcher friends, the Johnsons, from Glen Ayr Resort near Hoodsport, gave me a message that 6 orcas had passed their place at 4.24pm going south and fast. Right outside Hoodsport we believe were three adult females, perhaps 2 juveniles and a calf. They weere moving fast and then started lunging and with a few half breaches we believe they made a kill. They then started moving slowly towards Potlatch....I stayed and both heard the orcas and saw a fin here and there moving more towards the center of the channel and then it sounded as if they were slowly moving north but was too dark to keep track of them.
For the last three days they appear to have a pattern of arriving from the north, (who knows where from exactly), as we are getting no sighting info until (from 12.45pm or later) after they are around Ayock Point, Eagle Creek, Lilliwaup (moving south) and then they have been hanging around the Holiday Beach Resort around mid-afternoon. Apparently the whales have been quite active in that area. Then the whales move on around Hoodsport, Potlatch and even have been seen near Union around 4.00pm on till dark.
