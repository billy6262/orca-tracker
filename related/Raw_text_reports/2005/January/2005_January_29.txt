Orca Sightings for January 29, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I first spotted the
Orcas
at a pull out North of Triton Cove, where we met Judy and quite a few others. When the Orcas moved North out of site, my husband and I continued North, stopping at Dosewalips State Park, where we saw the Orcas once again. They were a bit closer into shore this time, but still moving North at a fairly quick clip. We drove north once more, pulling off the highway in Brinnon. We spent 30-45 minutes watching the Orcas at this spot. They slowed down around the entrance of Dabob Bay, spent some time circling a light bouy, doing a couple half breeches occasionally. They then continued North further into Dabob bay, seeming to explore along the way. They checked out a nearby boat who had cut their engines, then we noticed a group of gulls circling over the pod, before they finally continued North in Dabob Bay, diving under around

Those two tentative i.d.'s (T124A and T71) were the best I could do with the looks I got. The other four were juveniles of various sizes that I assume are all kids of the two females. The fin shape on the largest was similar to T71's oldest kid. I have not seen any recent photos of these whales but can imagine that they would both have a second kid by now. The last time I saw the moms were in separate encounters in different years back in the nineties up in southeast Alaska.

At a roadside viewing point south of Eldon a mile or so I spotted at least four
Orca
dorsal fins breaking water at about

11:50 a.m
. They were heading north at what seemed a leisurely pace. They just happened to break water at the point where I was focusing the binoculars, and they quickly disappeared from sight. Immediately after I commented on the sighting to my wife, we overheard a lady in the car behind us calling someone to tell her that they were on the way north toward Holly, on the other side of the canal.

I picked up the whales (
Transients
) at Jorsted creek, Hood Canal, about
11.00am
and saw all the blows backlighted with sunlight as they rounded Ayock Point heading north. They were traveling faster than yesterday and only on the surface for a short time before the same long dives as yesterday. They were by the crowd watching in no time so we did the run behind them. Checked again at Mike's Beach Resort and they were clipping right along. All six close together and surfacing with two together and the others before and after... a neat sight! Then it is hard to see from the road for trees so moved to Triton Cove and waited. We had a crowd gather and I picked them up first as they came into view. They had moved closer to the Kitsap side. About
1.30pm
they were moving closer to Seabeck then there were some changes as if they were crossing the channel. Moved again to Canal Tracts with a few others who still had not been able to see them. Found them again and watched them separating a little as if checking the area out... right across from the Duckabush Delta - good harbor seal territory! A couple of seals were swimming right in close to shore and they did not get caught this time! The transients did not appear to find anything or make a kill. They started still progressing in a traveling mode north when I had to leave at
1.30pm
.
