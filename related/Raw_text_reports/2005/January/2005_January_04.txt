Nancy Nolan called at

1:45 pm
to report 5 - 7
orcas
in Saratoga Passage, now real close to the Whidbey side, just SE of Baby Island, heading SE toward Bells Beach & Langley. She also saw 1 large male - it sounds like the Transient pod that's been around. She observed one boat with them, behaving respectfully & keeping its distance from the whales.

Very exciting, I live just south of Elger Bay (Camano Isl) and have been enjoying watching at least 6
Orcas
frolic and spout for the past hour (

1:30 -
2:30 pm
) on the far side of Saratoga Passage.

We were leaving Holmes Harbor and rounding the Baby Island buoy southbound at
1300hr
when we sighted a very active pod of 8
Orcas
. Baby Island was covered with seals, also intently watching the Orcas. The pod went back and forth several X between East point and Baby Island breaching, spy hopping, tail slapping. One big bull was observed and 2 small enough to be calves. Interestingly enough, when they met in groups of 3 or more on the surface we were able to plot them on radar. They stayed 1/4 mile off the shore of Whidbey Island as they went back and forth. We maintained a watch for 45min 1/2 mile off shore. No photos.

(yup, sounds like the transients - especially if the seals were all on the island! - sb)

At around

2:00 p.m
., I saw one
Orca
, just south of East Point on Whidbey Island, and then five minutes later another one in the same place. (Or perhaps the first one circled?). I just saw them surface once and then my view was obscured by trees so didn't see any markings. They were swimming south.

There was a small pod of
orcas
sighted on Holmes Harbour, just south of Honeymoon Bay. She said that around

1:00 PM
there was a group of orcas that entered Holmes Harbour and was observed to have headed toward Freeland, at the head of the harbour and then headed back out, after diving several times for extended periods.

I received the report below & went out to our bluff which is directly across Saratoga Passage from Elger Bay. I watched from about

12:15 -
12:35 pm
, & saw several spouts & fins, but they weren't being as active & were spread out between Elger Bay & further south along Camano's shore. My guess is this is the
Transient
pod that's been reported around the sound, but once again they are way too far away to get any ID's.

Dodie Markey of Camano Island called at

11:45 am
to report a small pod of 5 - 7
orcas
off Elger Bay, W. Camano Island, very active, with a big male breaching & lots of activity.
