Orca Sightings for January 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I finally found the
orcas
at
10 am
south of Lagoon Pt. on W. Whidbey Island, closer to the Whidbey side. They seemed to be hunting - lots of splashes, circling, etc. going on. I could see approx. 5 - 7 orcas, including one male. By
10:30 am they were off Lagoon Pt, quite close to shore. They were in two small groups, & began porpoising & traveling fast for a bit, then went into a resting line until they approached Admiralty Bay at
10:45 am, then dispersed back into small groups & looking like they were hunting again. I was able to get some video while they passed close by Lagoon Pt, & it looks like this is the Transient pod that's been around the Sound lately - 1 male, several females, & a calf or two. All seemed to have closed saddle patches, but I couldn't get a close enough look at the male to confirm that it was T87. I left them at
10:45 am as they were heading northwest across Admiralty Bay.
