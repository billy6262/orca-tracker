Orca Sightings for January 3, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's

16:30
hrs and the
orcas
are back heading south slowly feeding. Well dispersed right off Pt Richmond about 200 yds. See two males and several females and at least one baby. I don't know enough about these animals but the baby was playing (partialy breaching) or may be in some kind of trouble. I hope it's playing. Mom was very close. Anyway, they are fantastic and I've never seen them so many times in just a few days. Right now,
16:45 hrs,,they are probably half way between Pt Richmond and the south end of Vashon.
