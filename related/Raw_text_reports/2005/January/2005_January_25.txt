Orca Sightings for January 25, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

2:30 P.M.
we spotted a pod of 6
Orcas
. It appeared there were 3 cows and 3 calves. No large males. They were just north of Glen Ayr Park, and just South of Eagle Creek (Hood Cabnal) about mid channel. They were traveling in a southerly direction (slowly) and appeared to be feeding. There were lots of seagulls flying around and diving for left overs.

A crab fisherman called to report seeing a pod of ~5
orcas
between Crescent City, CA & Brookings, OR headed toward St. George Reef at
10 am
. He said they were spread out, & there was one male with a very large fin with a notch near the top. He also said the white on the orcas seemed more grayish or off-color.

I watched a pod of at least 5
Orcas
, (including one baby), swimming South toward Union. They were not as large as the one that came in 2003.

I got the first call at
1.30 pm
about the three whales mentioned in the beginning and later when I got home had a recorded message about from the same people that the whales had stayed two hours in the same location.... I think we've got transients!
