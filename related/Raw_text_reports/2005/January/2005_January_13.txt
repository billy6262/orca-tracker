Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at

1:15 pm
to report
K pod
had passed Dilworth Pt. & were still heading south. She reported later that they had made a great pass really close to Robinson, Pt. Maury Island, less than 50' from shore, doing some upside down tail lobbing! At

3:15 pm
they were around the bend from Gold Beach, off the Glacier Bay gravel pit site, still heading south.

I was gazing out my kitchen window about

9:00 am
this morning and saw a pod of something swim by Hidden Beach (Greenbank, E.Whidbey Island). I didn't have my binocs handy, so couldn't tell if they were Orcas or dolphins, but they moved by quickly & must have been at least 15. The sun was on them and I could only see silver/white as they were far out from shore.

I also thought I saw something flashing in the sunlight & waves this morning, but never could discern anything definite enough to report either - sb
