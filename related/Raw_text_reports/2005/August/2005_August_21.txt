After a 3 day sabbatical, the Southern Residents returned to the San Juans! Heading south towards The Center For Whale Research, we saw blows on the horizon. Later in the evening, near Battleship Island, the "fireworks" really got going. As we were returning home, we discovered another band of K's & L's being led by K-21.
