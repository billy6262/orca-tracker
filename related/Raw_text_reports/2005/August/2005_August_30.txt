Orca Sightings for August 30, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
All 3 pods (J-K-L)
, were off South Beach moving slowly toward False Bay, San Juan Island, at about

2:30pm
until we headed back at
4:00 pm. They were in small groups, vocalizing non stop. We even heard, quite clearly, above the water vocalizations, after we had pulled up our hydrophone! We saw females showing their bellies & males showing their "pink floyd"; courting, mating! Breaching, spyhoping, tail lobbing, headstands, cartwheels, and a spectacular juvenile orca back flip - breach! I had heard reports of a good salmon run, so perhaps the whales were well fed & able to expend that kind of energy. In between the acrobatics, the individuals, (males, females, juveniles, & calves all mixed together) in the groups were so close, they were touching, rolling, logging along at times. What we were witnessing really seemed sacred, and the overcast & drizle just added to the mystical feeling we shared with the people aboard.
