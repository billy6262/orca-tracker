Orca Sightings for August 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we went up to King George Terrace to see if we could see the two
humpback
whales - they were right out in the middle of the shipping lane however saw several black dorsals instead, making their way east around Trial Island. Learned from the onlookers that it was
Jpod
, who had apparently swung over to Race Rocks earlier today and then circled back and were heading at a good clip towards San Juan Island. Watched them for an hour then they disapeared behind Discovery Island.

J pod
came in from the west at about

1:30 p.m
., and after milling/foraging for awhile in the middle of Haro Strait went north, fairly non-eventfully, at least for us shore-based whale watchers. Most of the whales were offshore. A female and juvenile lagged behind the others with one sprouter closer in at Land Bank and Lime Kiln. Just as the whale watch operators became convinced the whales had turned south, the female off Land Bank breached twice close in to shore. Just after the breaching, we could see the northern orcas start porpoising south. At least 15 orcas swam within 20 to 100 yards of the beach, doing all kinds of great behaviors, while chasing fish to the surface. There were great photo ops for those on land, including a fishing/playing show by J19 and J41. Lots of porpoising while circling activity lead to lots of white water. J1 brought up the rear.

Approximately between

2:30 and
3:30
maybe? At Landbank some
L's and J's
passed Landbank a ways out, heading North towards LimeKiln. I noticed one straggler female still just a bit South of Landbank ... just one, no ID... but she was hanging back and moving slow. She finally got about to the gray house there just by Landbank and then she was swimming kind of in circles.. she did 2 full breaches and turned back South.
