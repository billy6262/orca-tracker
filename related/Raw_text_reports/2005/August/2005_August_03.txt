Report of whales at the mouth of the Fraser River at about
0830
today. By the time the boats were out on the water,
J Pod
and part of
L Pod
were southbound, about 1 mile North of the Roberts Bank Coal Terminal. At first they appeared to be in several resting lines, but soon seperated into matrilines, singles, and cow/calf pairs. All the adolescent males (4 sprouters present) were travelling together - having a bit of a boy party! When we left at about 11 A M, the whales were still southbound near Pt. Roberts.
