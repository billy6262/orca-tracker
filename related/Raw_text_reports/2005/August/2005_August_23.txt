Orca Sightings for August 23, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
A
humpback
on morning and afternoon trip. At about
3pm
, we were all treated to this single humpback breaching 30 times in a row!! 2 were full body out of the water, and a 360 degree spin on his/her axis. This was 2 miles south of Beechey head, S.Vancouver Island, with the animal breaching sucessively in a westerly direction. Incredible!
