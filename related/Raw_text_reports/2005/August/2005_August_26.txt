At around

10:30
while cruising Salmon Bank I caught sight of
Orca
dorsals about a mile or so west of the green bouy. These whales were tending in a southerly direction so we set out to have a look. As we were approaching the area one of the whales came up very near to us and was moving very fast in a northerly direction. It had a baby porpoise. We saw it tossed into the air several times and generally being "rag-dolled".
