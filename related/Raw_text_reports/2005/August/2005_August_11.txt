Orca Sightings for August 11, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lots of great Superpod activity these last few days - just wanted to add a few notes on some cool stuff we saw....Aug. 11 trip in the afternoon - we headed up the Strait of Georgia to meet up with K's and L's just as they were leaving Active Pass into the Strait - always seems to be a good spot to see increased whale activity - everywhere we looked there were groups of whales porpoising, splashing, and breaching! Then, as we followed across the Strait towards Tsawassen, a B C ferry came by, and as its wake neared the whales, they started surfing!! We could see bunches of fins streaking along at high speeds in the waves created by the ferry - SOOO Cool!! I've only seen this once before (in Active Pass)! THEN, as the K's and L's neared Tsawassen, we saw a group of whales heading our way, right towards them - turned out to be J pod! There was a reunion and then the mixing it up began, with lots of rolling around, upside down swimming, spyhops, breaches - big whale party!

Since no one else posted past Active Pass this morning, I will continue John's report from yesterday.... where he left off :) We (Vancouver Whale Watch) were positioned 1/2 mile or so (just shy of the ferry lane) offshore from the Mayne Island Ferry terminal and watched the parade of orcas come by. On the other side of Active Pass the whales emerge from the Pass. They then diverged from their usual route towards the Tsawwassen Ferry terminal and pointed their heads more toward Pt Roberts, and then it even looked like they were edging South a bit. Apparently Jpod was over there... and I am sure they knew :)

Gary Maurer called this morning at

8:10 am
to report seeing 3
spouts
in Hood Canal, south of Potlatch. He said they were quite a distance, but were very distinct blows, not splashing seals.From the shore we watched as
K's & L-12's
took their sweet time foraging near Low Island (San Juan County Park). Lots of swimming upside down, tail lobs, and a general "relaxed" feel to the movement. One juvenile really took its' time perusing a large kelp bed. Later in the day, out on the boat we saw the same whales near Moat Point, still traveling slow and steady. They were more spread out, and we had a nice view of K21 (Cappucino) and K40 (Raggedy). As the whales neared Active Pass, the leaders appeared to wait for the trailers so they could enter together.
