We heard that all 3 resident pods were headed East from Victoria, so we did a direct route from Steveston. Down by Victoria,
all 3 pods
were indeed present, travelling east in small groups and singly. Not much for vocals, but we were treated to alot of porpoising, plus some breaches and cartwheels.
