Orca Sightings for November 24, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb called at

9:38 am
to report a pod of
orcas
in Haro Strait, near Beaumont Shoals. First they were headed north, then turned & were headed south. From the size of the pod it looked like it was J's - they'll confirm ID's when they are able to get closer to them.
