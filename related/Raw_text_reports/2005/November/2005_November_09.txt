Orca Sightings for November 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of
J pod
15 - 20 Orcas very spread out, just south of the Victoria Waterfront,
1.20 pm
. No particular direction of travel as the Orcas were foraging. J1 (Ruffles) was identified by the Naturalist aboard Orca Spirit.

On the
11:30 ferry from Edmonds to Kingston we saw
orcas
in the choppy water, west of midchannel and just north of the ferry's westbound route at about

11:45 or so
. I think I saw one adult male at quite a distance & the whales were spread out quite far and seemed to be foraging, not traveling in any direction. When we got off the ferry we drove up onto the bluff and had some time to watch from there, and they soon passed by heading south. I estimated somewhere in the neighborhood of ten whales, give or take.

Mark of the Victoria Clipper called to report 4 or 5
orcas
a few miles due south of Clover Pt, Victoria BC at
~10 am
. No ID's, but they thought they were possibly Transients. They also reported a dead Calif. Sea Lion floating 2 miles due east of the very tip of Dungeness Spit.
*
A large pod, I think about 15 or so
orcas
are going south from Clinton ferry on the Whidbey side.

8:30 AM
.

A woman I met on S. Whidbey this morning had heard that ~9
orcas
had been sighted off the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry at
8 am
.
*
Just watched a pod of about eight
orcas
moving south past my home here on the bluff between Langley and Clinton (Saratoga Passage, E. Whidbey Isl). Thought I saw a young one as well. They passed here at

7:20 am
.
