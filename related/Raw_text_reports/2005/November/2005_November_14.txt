I saw blows just NW of Point No Point (Kitsap Peninsula) at

11:40 am
. The [
orcas
] were spread out between the peninsula & mid-channel, heading SE. I went further south on Whidbey to Scatchet Head, & finally at
12:40 pm they came into view, still heading SE toward Apple Cove Pt.

8:15am
, approximately 12 orcas, about mid-strait, heading east-southeast. During the 5-8 minutes we had them in sight they were mostly just heading in a straight line, obviously going somewhere. At least four males in the group, two traveling with the main group and two bringing up the rear. After we had passed, the two stragglers caused a large splash.
