Orca Sightings for November 3, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
It looked like all of
L pod
off Hannah Heights just after

8:00 a.m.
, including the L12's and L57. They were heading south into huge rollers, expending lots of energy at times just to stay in place, in the face of gale force winds. Initially they were tightly grouped on the surface, with calves sandwiched in between adults. Later as the water calmed slightly, they spread out horizontally, still making fairly slow progress south. Lost them in the surf at about
9:30 a.m.
