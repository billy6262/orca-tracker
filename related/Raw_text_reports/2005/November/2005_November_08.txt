Orca Sightings for November 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:00 a.m
there were 10 or more [
orcas
] 400 yards off the ferry dock on the North end of Vashon Island. One large male with distinctive white at the base of his fin. It looked as if they were moving south slowly and perhaps surrounding a large school of silvers. The captain slowed the ferry almost to a standstill and waited until the whales were well away from the ferry before resuming half speed.
