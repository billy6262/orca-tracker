Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales reported finding
J pod
off S. Vashon/Maury Islands in the
early afternoon
, & again around 6 pm as they headed north up Colvos Passage. He was able to listen to & record some S1 calls & echolocation clicks while the whales were in Colvos Passage.

Just enjoyed the sounds of
pod
heading north in Colvos passage at
6PM
. Spread out couple miles, lots of tail lobs! Pod unidentified up to about Blake Island now at
6:15PM.

We would like to report sighting a group of at least five
orcas
between

2:00 and
3:00 pm
. We first saw them as we were heading west out of Commencement Bay toward Point Defiance. We saw at least one female being shadowed very closely by her calf, and many more surfacing in a playful manner. They seemed to be heading toward Quartermaster harbor or up the Sound to Dash Point.

My parents are currently observing a pod of
Orcas
just off the Point Robinson (Maury Island) lighthouse at

11:30 AM
. Approximately nine animals with at least two males. Pod was seen approx 100 yds off shore heading south towards Pt. Defiance/Tacoma direction at a quick pace. They were observed breaching, lobtailing and chasing at least one fish (although not necessarily feeding - just playing with it!) Unable to identify pod.
