Orca Sightings for November 26, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We drove down to Scatchet Head, S. Whidbey Island, & found
J pod
about half way between Apple Cove Pt. & Point No Point (N. Kitsap Peninsula) at

3:15 pm
, heading NW toward Point No Point. We watched until
3:45, but they were too far away to see much but spouts & little tiny black dots.
Susan We have just spotted the
Orcas
about 1 mile south of Point No Point, ~

3:20 pm
. They are very close to the Kitsap side. Lots of splashing and spouts, fairly spread out. There must be at least 8-10 of them out there.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters & Island Adventures called with an update on the
orcas
- at
2 pm
they were in the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes, most on the Edmonds side, looking like they were going to continue northward. He confirmed it was
J pod
, no other pods were seen. Nov. 24/25 On Thanksgiving day, 11/24, at about
11:45 a.m. my daughter and I saw a whale spout and splashing in Case Inlet, off the north pointe of Harstine Island in the south Puget Sound. Furthermore, we saw what appeared to be a seal getting pulled under and a large flock of sea birds flying overhead, indicating possible feeding activity of an orca. The individual appeared to be traveling south. The next day some kayakers said they had seen a whale spout and splashing near the same location. Residents of Hartstine Island have reported gray whale sightings in the spring in the past. Is it possible that we saw an orca? Jill Roberts Portland, OR This is an area where transient orcas tend to feed, & from the description above it sounds like this could be the case - sb

1:15 pm J's
have now turned and are Northbound, center of the Sound approaching Edmonds.

Tom McMillen called with an update on his first report - at
1 pm
the
orcas
were headed NE toward Edmonds - he had identified J pod for sure, had seen more whales further south & said there could possibly be another pod present.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters/Island Adventures called at

12:30
pm to report
orcas
south of Kingston, near Pt. Monroe (this is the next point north of the below sighting), heading south.
*
We've just spotted a pod of
Orcas
moving north past Skiff Point on Bainbridge Island; it is
noon
. They are out in the center of the shipping lanes so it's too hard to determine precise numbers or markings. Several boats are in fairly close looking at them. They seem to be swimming steadily north and are spread out for at least a half-mile or so.
