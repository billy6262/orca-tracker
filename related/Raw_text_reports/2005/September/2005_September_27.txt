Orca Sightings for September 27, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
On
11a
m we were camping on Strawberry Island, just west of Cypress Island, and saw a group of about 10 orcas close to the middle or Rosario Strait, cruising south. Later, another group of about 10, travelling parallel to the first group but very close to shore, came into view. The group near the middle seemed to be mostly larger animals, while the group closer to shore seemed to be mostly smaller ones, with perhaps 2-3 bigger "chaperones."
Thanks,
Don

to report about 10
orcas
, the
L2's
, off Henry Island near Kellett Bluff. He was hearing some great echolocations & vocalizations, & was kind enough to record some our voice mail along with his report!

Orcas
just north of Henry Island today. The first female coming into view proved to be no other than L67 Splash - Luna's mum. Meanwhile L78 Gaia and L101 Aurora were enjoying the wake that a huge freighter left and playing in the tideline.
