Orca Sightings for September 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spent the afternoon with 2
minke
whales, joan (named after joni mitchell, because of "her" circular movement patterns...circle game.....get it? another term is a correlated random walk). the other whale has a dorsal fin that droops over onto the right side. we call "him" bob dole. the really cool thing is that bob dole was seen off speiden and we followed him over towards patos. joan, who we have seen several times off salmon and hein banks was there as well. in the 1980's we found that individuals tended to stay in one area. the waldron island area used to be a minke hotspot (minke lake), but it has been relatively sparse in minke whale sightings, generally.
