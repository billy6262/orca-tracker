Marty Robinette reported a
gray
whale in Penn Cove around
2 pm
, near the Capt. Whidbey Inn heading out.
*
"Fabulous Freddy"; the
gray
whale, has been hanging out in Shoal Bight, east side of Lopez Island, for 3 months now. The gray appears robust & healthy, and has some nice markings for ID, since grays can be difficult to Identify individually. This gray has some nice round white spots on its left flank, and an x shaped scar on its right side above the dorsal nuckles.
