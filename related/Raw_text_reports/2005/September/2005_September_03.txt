Orca Sightings for September 3, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
J's, K's, and part of L Pod
reported coming down Boundary Pass. They were in a semi-resting pattern until they got to the Turn Point Lighthouse. It was as if the incoming flood tide was a wake-up call, as they began to actively forage the kelp beds near the lighthouse. Then the tailslapping, spyhopping, and breaching began. As the J's approached the middle of Speiden Channel/Haro Strait area, they all grouped up, passed off our bow about 150 yards, and were doing multiple double breaches, spy hops, tail lobs, and tons of very loud vocalizations.
