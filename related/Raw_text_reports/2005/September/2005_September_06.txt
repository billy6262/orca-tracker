Orca Sightings for September 6, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were also with all three
pods
from about False Bay as they headed toward Cattle Point. Very spread out and very boisterous. The vocalizations were continuous while we were on scene. We encountered a
Minke
in the middle of all the ruckus who just seemed to have cared less about the Orcas. We spent a good half hour or so with the young
gray
whale off of Lopez. Still in his same spot.

Saw all 3
pods
near the South end of San Juan Island - incredible vocals and hardly any boatnoise, which was amazing with all the boats present...lots of courtship behavior going on, noting esp. K21 Cappuccino was displaying himself in all his glory. Also observed what I thought could have been actual mating about 20 feet (a guess) or so underwater right by the stern of our boat - 2 whales moving very slow and touching all I could see was one big white shape flashing but it lasted for at least 30 sec to a minute - then they surfaced in about the same spot. If anyone is interested, I post my:
pictures of each day

All three
pods
very active somewhere along the south coast of San Juan Island. Lots of spy hops, some jumps 3/4 of the way out of the water, lots of tail slapping, and one orca swam right beside the boat just under the surface on its back, so we were looking at its belly.
