We had en encounter of the
Transient
type. A group of 12 transients had been located along Pender Island, in Swanson Channel. By the time we got on scene, they were meandering along Mayne Island, and seemed to be alternating between going up Trincomali Channel, or through Active Pass. They chose Active Pass. We did observe the whales in hunting mode, with some lunges, quick changes in direction, a line of four surfacing together and heading straight for the seals, some rolling over onto their backs. The whales continued out of Active Pass to the east, and into the Strait of Georgia, where the group of 10 females and juveniles headed almost straight East towards the coal terminal, while the 2 males took a more Northeastly direction. We left them shortly after they entered the Strait, at about

1:30 PM

Susan Hitman called to report seeing a whale while kayaking off the Union Bay Marina, Hood Canal at
5 pm
. They saw it spout, & saw the flukes come up 3 times. Sounds like it may be the
gray whale
that has been reported in Hood Canal previously?
