Orca Sightings for September 20, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas
spread out from False Bay/Hannah Heights all the way up to Open Bay/Kellet Bluff. J-1, J-2, and K-11 traveling in the lead. What appears to be a super pod is now passing Low Island/San Juan County Park. Two large groups of 12+ whales stopped to inspect the large bull kelp bed right off of Low Island. The still water made underwater viewing quite easy as the whales would slowly meander around the kelp bed. Their heads moving side to side as if they were scanning the kelp for salmon was amazing. One juvenile approached the kelp bed completely upside down the whole length of the kelp bed. Then one larger female came up completely wrapped in kelp! A couple of whales nearby did spyhops as if they were watching her roll around!
