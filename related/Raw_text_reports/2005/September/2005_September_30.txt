Orca Sightings for September 30, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found
J pod
at Hannah Heights at

8:30 a.m
. and watched J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny and J8 Speiden slowly forage almost in place, moving less than 1/2 mile, until
10:30 a.m.
K and L pods
were further south foraging slowly. The whales seemed to be spread from about Salmon Bank to Hannah Heights. I caught them again going slowly north past LandBank at about
1:00 p.m. led by J1, with J2 and J8 about 1/4 mile behind. L57 patrolled offshore mostly by himself, going north then south about three times. L41 passed close to shore, tail-slapping. At about
1:30 p.m. as I watched the residents going north, I caught sight of about 4 to 6 orcas porpoising south close to Vancouver Island, well above Oak Bay. I'm not sure if they were residents or transients, but I think they were
transients
by how they were travelling. They porpoised in unison 4 times, then went down for about 5 minutes. When they came up, they were much further south. They surfaced 4 times in unison that I saw, then again did a long dive. I saw them once more about 5 minutes later when they again came up and surfaced four times just past Oak Bay.

So. Residents
off the west side of San Juan Island & watched them much of the
afternoon
. We first found them around noon off Hannah Heights, mainly heading north from Hannah Heights to Lime Kiln, with many direction changes by different groups of whales, looked like all 3 pods. We watched until about
12:45, then headed to the Center for Whale Research to continue watching as they passed by. From the Center, we watched from 1 -
2:30 pm as they mainly headed north, making some close passes by the Center, still spread out, traveling in many small groups with some great vocalizations.

On the west side of San Juan Island, at Andrews Bay, a visit with the Southern
residents
. J pod seemed to be in a big hurry to head North, with J1 in the lead, heading towards Henry Island. The group was headed North, then appeared to go South. Then they milled about for awhile, and just when we were prepared to head back North and spend some time with Ruffles and the gang, the milling group finally made up their minds. Once they started heading North, it was as if they had to make up for lost time. They came porpoising by, singly and in groups of up to 5 animals at a time.

The north end of Limekiln Park, we already saw Ruffles
J1
. Whales were travelling north and very spread out. Well this changed quite rapidly when all of a sudden we basically found ourselves surrounded by whales from all sides - with no way to even think of moving. The vocals were amazing, and the fact that there was absolutely no boatnoise was wonderful. Amazing echolocation too, and an array of calls.
