============================================================

Entry 1:
About

5:00 pm
, we had a tremendous sighting of 2, maybe 3,
humpback
whales in Malaspina Strait, near the southern tip of Texada Island, in central Strait of Georgia. They lingered on the surface for quick some time and also went down for 2 deep dives while we watched.
