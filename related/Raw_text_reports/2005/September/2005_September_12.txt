Orca Sightings for September 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another amazing day of whale watching from San Juan Island. At around

8:30 a.m K-pod
slowly went north up the island. Then at about 10 a.m. we caught what appeared to be all three pods taking several hours to go south down the island, spread out from a mile or more offshore all the way tight in to shore. At one point from above Hannah Heights, through binoculars in one field of vision, I could see four different types of cetaceans--
a dozen dall's porpoises, a humpback, two minke whales and many orcas
. The Dall's porpoises were foraging and porpoising all across Haro Strait. The
humpback
was circle feeding several miles offshore. There were at least five
minkes
, some traveling in a straight line, while others lunge fed through bird balls. And far off in the distance were the orcas.

At
6pm
I was fishing off Church rock. A group of 9 or so
transients
passed me eastbound towards Race. I followed them a short while and they spread out over about 2 miles, then took off in a southerly direction chasing harbour porpoise. At about 7pm they were just off the VR buoy south of Race.

I was watching the west side of San Juan this morning and while on the phone I saw 5 breaches in a row. We headed out to False Bay, where
J's & K's
were spread out, and moving fairly slowly towards Salmon Bank. As we watched J1 Ruffles off in the distance, we had a group of 4 extremely boisterous whales come near the boat and put on a veritable primer on whale behaviors. Everything from upside down swimming, spyhops, rolling on top of each other, above surface vocalizations, breaches.
