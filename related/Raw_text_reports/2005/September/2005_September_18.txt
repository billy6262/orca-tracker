Orca Sightings for September 18, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
My father and I were boating off Double Bluff, Whidbey Island around

6:30pm
and saw 2 sprays about 200 yards away. We stopped to try and get a better look, but were unable to locate them again.

While paddling off the north side of Makah Bay south of Cape Flattery, we encountered one
grey
who was fishing in a tide rip. Most who paddle to the cape often see greys and humpbacks regularly in the past few weeks.

3:30 & 4 pm

A pod of
orcas
came through Active Pass just after
1 PM
- after they passed through the standing waves caused by the flooding tide just east of Helen Point, there was a great deal of breaching and tail slapping.

We met up with the
Southern Residents
in Swanson Channel near North Pender Island at about

12:30
. The whales were all travelling North, but many of them were swimming in mixed pod groups today - and not just the males! Felt very much like a family reunion. The whales emerged from Active Pass to encounter a line of tide rips and standing waves caused by the tide change. They went right through it all. What a treat to watch these animals surfing through the white water, with many spyhops, lazy breaches and tail lobs as they made their way into the relative calm of Georgia Strait. Once out in the Strait, the whales spread out over quite a distance, travelling in large groupings. They didn't appear to be in a huge hurry as headed towards the Coal Docks, and there was lots of time for play. We finished off our tour today with a display of cartwheels and a very high breach.
