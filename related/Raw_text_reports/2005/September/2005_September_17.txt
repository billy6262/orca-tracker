Orca Sightings for September 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
There is a
gray
whale hanging out north of Cape St. Mary: south of Lopez Pass. It's been there a week at least now. Happened to see a
minke
whale east of Lopez Pass; approximately 1/2 mile.

Around
2 p.m
. I was at Double Bluff Beach, Whidbey Island, about at the windsock when I heard 2 "noises" coming from the water. I looked up to see spray and a
black fin
submerging. I told 2 other ladies on the beach and a little while later one saw some white submerging. Assuming it was 1 whale fairly close to shore - the tide was out far but coming in.

A
Superpod
passed by the Lime Kiln today...J pod came rollling in close to shore, all together, and in a moment skidded to a stop and turned right in front of us...They hovered on the surface for about 30 seconds, turned and continued north again. The PODS were in tight groups and in close to shore. They went North pass the Lighthouse, then turned and headed South again. It seemed the whales were going North and South all day. But it wasn't until close to
4 pm
that they entered the whale watch park. Last I seen them, they were headed south and I could still make out at least two separate large groups swimming side by side.
