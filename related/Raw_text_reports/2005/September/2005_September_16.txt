Orca Sightings for September 16, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
A
pilot whale
was seen in Grays Harbor. The Coast Guard was giving a demonstration to a group of people sponsored by the Grays Harbor Chamber of Commerce and the lone pilot whale stole the show..it was swimming in Half Moon Bay just off of Westport. The lone whale surfaced at least six times.

About

6:00-
7:00
...out at Landbank...
whales
spread out everywhere, heading South. They were for the most part a ways off... too far to ID... other then male/female. They were about 100 yards off the bank... all the way from Limekiln... to False Bay... and way over near the Vancouver Island side... Far away... yet the sound of their blows was incredible. And many distant claps of thunder as they breached over and over.... as well as deafening tail slaps!

J's, K's & L's
spread out from Eagle Point to Hein Bank. J's & K's were aiming North to ride the flood, and most of L's were still down around False Bay. As we waited in the fairly calm waters of False Bay, we were able to spot lots of L's going along the shoreline. At 1/4 mile distance, some of the ID's were a bit tough, but we were able to clearly ID L-41 Mega, as well as L-71 Hugo. L87 Surprise came up near our boat. Later as we watched L's near the Land Bank, we saw a group of 6 orcas turn into a small cove just South of Deadman's Bay, where two of them did glorious spyhops in the kelp beds.
