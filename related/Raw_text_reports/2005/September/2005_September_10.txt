Orca Sightings for September 10, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were coming back from a very rolly fishing day out off Sekui and just as we were coming up on the marina about 100 feet off the breakwall we went right over a
gray
whale without even knowing it. So we slowed down and watched the big fellow for a few minutes who appeared to just be frolicking back and forth in the kelp beds.

I caught the
orcas
today at about

10:30 a.m.
(west San Juan Isl) as they came in from the west. J and K pods went north immediately, while most of the L's went south a couple of miles offshore. There were about 10 to 15 of the L's that spread out more inshore from Land Bank to Hannah with no commercial boats on them, but some very bad pleasure boats. Eventually these L's tightened up and went south along the shore. At about

4:30 p.m
. all of L pod started heading inshore and north. Most of the whales were tight along the shore. There were lots of tail slaps, some breaching and lots of inverted and sideways behaviors. At Land Bank many of the whales went kelping and came up
carrying salmon
. They appeared to be happy orcas. Again two of the smallest calves were engaged in a diving and tail slapping contest. It was a great show. I left them at about

7:15 p.m
. as they were tight along the shoreline at Lime Kiln Park.
