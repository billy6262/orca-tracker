Orca Sightings for September 25, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
L Pod
all morning on the West side of San Juan Island, spread between Lime Kiln to False Bay in the morning, then from False Bay to Salmon Bank & Hein Bank in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the L's decided to be more active, making a sharp turn back towards the shore near False Bay, and one group of L's breached 22 times! Around 3 PM, we get a call that
J's & K's
have shown up---in San Juan channel! A rare occurrence these days for sure--so off we went up to find them. We managed to find them almost to the entrance to Friday Harbor. After the whales made the pass within feet of Turn Island (to the great enjoyment of those on shore), they began to play and be quite percussive--lots of tailslapping, rolling, and generally rowdy behaviors. As they neared Goose Island, the second group (composed mainly of J's with L-57 still with them), they began activity so percussive, Kari described it aptly as "popcorn". Tons of breaches, tailslaps, multiple spyhops, all in the space of a few seconds. With J's & K's rounding Cattle Point, and L's hanging around False Bay, the scene was primed for a potential greeting ceremony. The grunts, squeals, and whistles were so loud--it was amazing. The sounds echoed across the water.
