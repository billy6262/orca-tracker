Orca Sightings for December 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw two
orcas
on the road to Neah Bay just west of the Sekiu River at about

11:30am
. They were traveling west at a relaxed pace. One female, one male. The male had what looked like a 5-6" scar on the leading edge of his left side saddle patch. Heard that there was another sighting on that stretch earlier that morning, but can't confirm if they were the same whales or widely disbursed pod members.
