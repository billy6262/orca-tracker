Orca Sightings for July 13, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
13-16
orcas
viewed close to shore (100-400 metres) at Lighthouse Park, Point Roberts observed swimming NW to SE with 6-8 whale watching boats in the area.
*
A
gray whale
in Shoal Bight on the east side of Lopez Island. It is a small animal (not a calf), and although we observed it feeding it appeared to be underweight. We obtained ID photos and after a very quick check it does not match any of the young gray whales seen previously this season.
