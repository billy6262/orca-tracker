Orca Sightings for July 16, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We came across the
superpod
south of Lopez Island. I had not ever seen an Orca before, and it was something that will forever be special to me. There was so much activity with the animals. Although I do not know technically what the whales were doing, I can say they sometimes came completely out of the water, sometimes just peaked out of the water so their head and upper body showed, did a cartwheel, swam along the surface together, and did small leaps and huge leaps. They seemed to be so happy. One male, who was identified as "Faith"? by our naturalist, laid on his back and showed us his male anatomy. When we first saw the superpod at about

4:30
, there were 5 boats. By
7:00, I counted 15 boats watching. On the way back to Anacortes, we also came across a
gray
whale feeding. He was pretty small, and has been hanging around the area for a couple of weeks.
