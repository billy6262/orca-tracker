Orca Sightings for July 25, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's and L's
engaging in - perhaps the Georgia Strait Shuffle? - about

4:30 p.m
. we saw them south of Pt. Roberts heading south, all spread out - about

5:30-ish they joined up in a big group and started major frolicking - lots of baby breaches, cartwheels, spyhops, tail waves and lobs, upside down swimming with pec slapping - AND great vocalizations on the hydrophone to go along with it! At that point, they again turned and were heading back north as we left them.
