We saw 4
orcas
at about

10:00 or
10:30 a.m
. at Rendsland Creek, at the southern tip of the Kitsap Peninsula. There have been many sightings in this area over the winter. The whales came in quite close to shore, at low tide possibly 20-yards off shore (I'm not good with distances, but it looked like they were near the large dropoff). They will milling around; we assumed they were feeding but don't know that for sure. There was one male (note - this pod is actually 2 adult females & 4 juveniles - sb), one female, a baby, and another in between the baby and the female in size. After milling around for about a half hour, they moved off toward the south.

Saw a pod of 4-6
orcas
swimming south about
10AM
at Ayock Beach. Breaching, porpoising, spyhopping and fluke slapping maybe 200 yards off the shore for a good 10 minutes before they resumed heading south. Clearly a few (2?) were smaller and just swimming. The larger ones seemed more interested in the spyhopping, fluke slapping.

Received a call from Corinne McGrady of Lilliwaup this
afternoon
that the Hood Canal
Slippery Six
had just passed her home, heading south toward Hoodsport. She said they were very active. Soon one of my neighbors reported they were off the Hoodsport Winery, just north of us. They were mid-Canal, a little closer to the Bald Point side, and were really splashing around...the gulls were everywhere... The orcas seemed to be transiting south-southeast for awhile. The Six finally gave up and did an about- face, heading back up the Canal -- I sighted them again off my home above Sandy Point in Potlatch about 20 minutes later.

The
HCTransients
just went South in front of Hoodsport and the winery,

12:30 pm
. They are really moving fast stay down for 5 to 10 minutes. Around
12:00 noon I got a report from Linda S. that they were in Lilliwaup playing, then heading South. They were in Hoodsport about 15 mins. later.

I am out in Newfoundland and was at Cape Spear this morning where there were lots of humpback whales feeding on the capelin that have come to shore to spawn. They are pretty vocal and it is all pretty magnificent.
