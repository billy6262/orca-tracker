Orca Sightings for July 5, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spent some time north of Eagle Pt. with
J-Pod
today. They were very spread out, probably fishing. When we came on scene, however, J19 was preoccupied with something entirely different: she was lifting her calf, who seemed generally unresponsive, with her head. The calf seemed to just roll off a number of times, and she seemed quite frantic as she attempted to hoist it into the air. Finally she seemed to calm down, and swam directly off our port bow. As she passed about 5 feet under the water bellow me, I could make out the shape of the calf held in her mouth. She was moving very quickly, and was joined momentarily by another female. A third came up behind her, and could easily have been doing 15 knots as it swam to catch up. We then lost sight of them. Later on the calf was seen swimming on its own, but word on the radio as we were leaving had it that J19 was again lifting the calf up to the surface. Hopefully the researchers who were on scene have some better news later today!

J-Pod
passed Lime Kiln Lighthouse today (
July 5) between one and two in the afternoon. We witnessed an unusual event: three whales swimming around and pushing what appeared to be a young harbor porpoise. The porpoise did not seem to be in the whales' mouths, but they were moving it with their noses at the surface. There was no visible blood and the body of the porpoise did not appear again or wash up, but neither did we see the animal swim away. I have heard several accounts over the last few years of L-Pod playing with porpoise bodies or infant porpoises, but this is the first time I have witnessed anything of this sort with J-Pod.
