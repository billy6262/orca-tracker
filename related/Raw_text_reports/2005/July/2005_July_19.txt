Orca Sightings for July 19, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

6:30 PM
we had the
L12s and J-Pod
meet in front of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. The L12s had been going up and down the west side all day. But when we got a late afternoon report of Js coming down from Turn Point, they finally decided to head north to meet them. The first whales to meet were J1 and J2 with L41 and his sisters. It was neat to see those two huge dorsal fins swimming side by side! The two pods met right at the lighthouse, milled for a bit, then moved offshore where they did lots of breaching before finally going south around
8:30.
