Orca Sightings for July 6, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
J pod
in Bellingham Channel and I did get a couple of good views of J41. All the J's were together moving slowly north in Bellingham Channel. At some point they looked to be in a resting line.

Spike Lowery called to report he had observed the Hood Canal
Transients
swim under the bridge, heading north at
5 pm
, in traveling mode, on the west side of the canal. There were some boats & jet skis on the north side of the bridge, & the whales dove & he didn't see them come up again.
