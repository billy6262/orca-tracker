Orca Sightings for July 18, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

6:30pm
, two
grays
slowly travelled between Shipwreck Point (9 1/2 miles west of Clallam Bay) and Slip Point (Clallam Bay). We believe they may have turned around at Slip Point and headed back out to the ocean, as they slowly came back past later in the evening, or by coincidence, two different grays passed the original two? They appeared to be feeding directly off the kelp bed, as they would circle from the kelp bed out and back again, while slowly moving eastward. On the westward trip the whales kept moving on a straighter course.

At Lime Kiln State Park at

10:30
...we saw whales approaching us from the south. For the next 45 minutes we watched as the whales passed us probably no more than 100 yards off the shore.

Well it was an amazing day for viewing the orcas of
J and L pod
. We were sitting in the opening to Mosquito Pass between San Juan and Henry Island avoiding the severe rip tide that was developing off Henry. The whales appeared to be hanging out about 300-400 yards out from the shore of Henry Island and were passing through the rip to the North. A young male appeared to pass very close and head on with a female. Next thing I know I see them approaching within about 50 yards and I see the male and his penis. Then I watched as the females appeared to go under one of the females to support her??? Just guessing. Then the male came along side and they appeared to couple briefly, after they seperated the females all went together and surfaced about 80 yards out.
