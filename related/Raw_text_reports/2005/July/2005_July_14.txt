I caught sight of the Hood Canal
Transients
in front of Pleasant Harbor on the west side at
8am
this morning. They were in travel mode heading south. They seemed to be down to business, no playing, just swimming in a tight group with a spyhop to check where they were. I watched them head down to the Duckabush and then lost them. Later at

12:15pm
I spotted them right out front of my house passing Maple Beach on the east side of the canal heading north. Just like earlier this morning they were in slow travel mode all together in a tight group. I lost them as they headed up north around the toandos peninsula bend towards Bangor.
