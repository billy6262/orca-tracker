Orca Sightings for July 29, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We located
J, K & most of L pod
southbound in the Strait of Georgia, just south of the Fraser River. The vocals were amazing and so was the above water action. We saw lots of breaches, tail lobbing, and cartwheels. By the afternoon, the same group was in Boundary pass and speed porpoising their way around Turn Point.
