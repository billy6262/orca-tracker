Orca Sightings for July 2, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to say they had been with
J pod
in the morning at Open Bay, heading north, & observed
J19 with a new calf
. The calf was also observed by Mark Mallard & others, & video was taken so it sounds like a sure thing, just awaiting final confirmation from the Center at this point. They also saw K pod at Lime Kiln heading south.
*
We had
K Pod
heading up the west side of San Juan Island, and they turned and greeted us at the Turn Point Lighthouse. Lots of porpoising in the area, which is rich with strong currents.
