Orca Sightings for February 24, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Finally that hoped-for call at
1.20 pm
..... whales (Hood Canal
Transients
) seen across from Seal Rock near the "tower" (presumably Zelatched Point) and guess what....Yippee! traveling north! ...here they came.... straight north towards me. Sure enough they finally arrived straight ahead just in front of the Bolton Peninsula....then went west into the bay. Maybe saw four above water "sightings". Finally we got a little tease by two black fins and a few blows as two whales swam by the Bolton Penin to enter Dabob Bay to the northeast. ... a fisherman had said that four orcas had come out the bay and gone into Upper Dabob Bay.
