Orca Sightings for February 14, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hello, yes they are the offshore type. We also saw a group of about 30 last week in Monterey Bay
CA
. We also had a group of transients about 7 attack and kill a Risso's dolphins in Monterey Bay on monday. That is the first documented case of killer whales attacking and successfully killing and feeding on a Risso's dolphin.

This is second hand but I heard from Dennis Kelly that on Valentine's Day they had a huge (over 28)
offshore
pod off Dana Point in Southern California. Dennis was able to get out there and had a wonderful time--he said there were at least 6 big males and maybe more (the group was spread out into 3 groups) and a new baby. They came quite close to the boat and he says some were bow riding on their 60' boat! He got some great pictures and Alisa Schulman-Janiger is looking at them for i.d's. He described one male with a notched fin to her (over the phone) and she knew which one it was.

The Center for Whale Research was out with the Hood Canal
Transients
late afternoon, reporting T71, T124A & kids at Union, traveling fast north up the east shore, then heading west at Glen Ayr. They lost them around

5:15 pm
.

Judy Dicksion called to report the Hood Canal
Transients
had been sighted at noon milling around Lilliwaup & then turned south, & were seen near Hoodsport at
1:30 pm.

I saw them (Hood Canal
orcas
) heading north up the canal at

10:30 AM
in front of the Rest-A-While RV park. They were traveling about in the middle of the canal and it was quiet on the water, so I heard their blows as they came up! A boat was respectfully observing, so I imagine it was Orca-people on official business.
