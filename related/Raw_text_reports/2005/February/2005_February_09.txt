Orca Sightings for February 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
One from Eagle Creek as they were about to disappear out of view on the east side of the canal to the south. The light was great for seeing many blows and it appeared one breach, by the splashing. I knew from the Shellfish employees at Pt. Whitney that the orcas had left that area about 8.30am and Brian had already sent that info in to you. Merle had spoken to a friend at Sea Mount who said the
transients
had passed about
10.00am
traveling fast to the south. I then moved to the bluffs north of Lilliwaup and though waited quite a while did see the blows of probably all six just as they were rounding the point of the SW corner of the Kitsap peninsula.
