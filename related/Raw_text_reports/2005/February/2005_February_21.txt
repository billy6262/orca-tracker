Orca Sightings for February 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark "Mallard" Malleson drove along the Victoria waterfront and saw a splash. Called me to watch while he rushed to get his own boat. I now have about 10
whales
going East from Clover Pt. to Trial Island. We meet Dave and Kyla from the center and Ian from Naturally Salty off Darcy Is. Hope Dave has a detailed ID.
T87 and friends
. We left them nearing Halibut Is.
The big news at least to me was a report from Cape Beal Light on the west coast of
6 Greys
going North at
1530
.

Dave and I ended up going out on 10
transients
around noon today after we got a report from Mark Mallard Malleson that there were whales coming our way from Seabird Pt, Discovery Is. We picked them up north of Beaumont Shoals at
1308
and followed them north up to Kelp Reef around the west side of Darcy Island, through Hughes Passage and then up Haro Strait towards Turn Pt at
1744
. There were at least two kills, one (and probably more) possibly of harbor porpoise off the south end of D'arcy and then just before we left at sunset we had an awesome Dall's porpoise kill just off Stuart Island. After a bout of slow traveling/resting type behavior the whales started milling in north Haro Strait about mid Stuart Island. It seemed like the adults were sitting back and letting the juveniles do the work in a sort of training type situation. An adult female was also present maybe to guide them along. The kill took about 25 minutes. At one point the porpoise swam by the boat and was not looking good. We got a couple of good shots of the porpoise looking pretty beat up. Just before what seemed to be the end it appeared to have blood in its blow and a few times we could see the porpoise being pushed around or in a whale's mouth. We had to drive home in dusky lighting but it was definitely worth the late trip home. We saw the
T46s (T46, T46B, T46B1, T46C, T46D, T46E), T88s (T87, T88), T122 and T97
. It was interesting because neither T47 nor T90 were there and they are usually with those groups.

2 -3 groups of 1-2
whales
spread apart in what looked like hunting formations. At sunset we observed them between Sisters Point moving toward shore in what appeared to be hunting. We could not determine if they were successful but the amount of splashing and how close they were to shore (North Shore) makes us think they were at least hunting. Each day the whales appeared before sunset.
