Orca Sightings for February 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call on Feb. 20 from Capt. Bill Parducci, reporting a sighting of 40-50
orcas
on Feb. 12, 4 - 6 miles off
Russian River, CA
, heading south.

The "slippery six" (Hood Canal
Transients
) were below our property on the Canal between

1:40 am and
2:10 am
this morning. We live on the west side, a mile south of Hoodsport, directly across the Canal from Bald Point. Stepped out on my deck for a moment around
1:35am, and heard that plaintive call that alerted me to their presence a couple of days ago...I could hear them for quite a while in the area of the first wide turnout on HWY 101 north of Potlatch, still quite close in. Then they started to move toward the middle of the Canal, possibly in the direction of Union-- their blows became fainter, but still north of Potlatch.
