Orca Sightings for February 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Judy Dicksion called at

2:40 pm
to report the pod of
transient
Orcas in Quilcene Bay, Hood Canal. They were near Fisheries Pt. at
11:45 am, where they made a kill.
*
Judy Dicksion called again in the afternoon to report the pod of
transients
were by the Quilcene Marina at the north end of the bay & had made 3 or 4 kills. They then came down the west side of Quilcene Bay, into a deep cove where there was a lot of action & another kill. They went south into Dabob Bay, mid-channel, going south across from Whitney Pt. at

4:05 pm
*
After my last call saying the
transients
had left Quilcene Bay and were heading south about
4.00pm
, I never got to pick them up further down the canal. They had spent the 2 hrs I saw them in Quilcene Bay doing lots of breaching, side-breaching, tail slapping etc. This was interspersed with lengthy underwater times, presumably spent eating, considering the flock of sea gulls diving and swooping above where they were last seen. We must have seen possibly four kills: 1 at head of the bay, 2 near the Marina and another along the west side of the bay opposite Fisherman's Point (SW end of the Bolton Peninsular). Then when they did decide to leave they went into their "underwater speed-racing" mode traveling from near the west shore to mid-channel past Point Whitney with only one quick surface appearance of all six in close formation.
