Entry 1:
I'm a fisheries biologist with Washington Dept of Fish and Wildlife who was fishing salmon near Seabeck Yesterday (2/16). We counted at least 5
whales
(2 appeared much smaller than the others).

We just got back from two weeks in Costa Rica. A fishing boat came in last week with reports of
Orcas
, perhaps up to ten, breaching near their boat. The captain said he had never seen such an event before, but sometimes captains say that to make passengers feel more like they have seen a unique event. The boat was about 40 miles off shore, bill fishing. They had been catching a lot of sailfish and Dorado.
Also, at one of the dive shops, which was also an internet cafe, the owner showed me some underwater film of about 5 Orcas feeding on a type of ray, which were about four feet in width. Amazing shots, taken right off the coast near Playa Flamingo.

Eveyln Burnett called in a report of the
transient
pod in Hood Canal at

11:08 am
off Hoodsport, with a research boat with them.

We had a sighting (Hood Canal
Transients
) south of Scenic Beach Park near Seabeck today at about

4:15 pm
. The Orca group were first sighted North of Quatsap Point mid-canal. It looks as if they made two separate kills. The whales were diving as a group in the same place and then spent along time submerged to feed. A lot of sea gulls were above them picking up scraps as they fed. Then they were off again headed north past Brinnon toward Seal Rock and Dabob Bay. Some tail slapping and spy-hopping were observed. We lost them about

5:30 pm
as they headed away from us to the west side of the canal.

The
Slippery Six
did their usual routine a number of times but Dave and Kyla (Ctr. for Whale Research) stuck it out and managed to catch up each time they tried to completely disappear! They started about
10.00 am
off Hoodsport and were with them until about
3.30p
m. They did plenty of leisurely meandering from side, to mid-channel then would cut across to the other side. When the crew left them today I watched from land a while and they appeared to move to mid-channel after Triton Cove then seemingly closer to the Kitsap Peninsula. I left a msg for Kathy Cole in Seabeck but I think she found them on her own at Scenic Beach Park, Seabeck about 4.30pm and she believes they made two kills then started moving at 5.15pm towards Dabob Bay.
