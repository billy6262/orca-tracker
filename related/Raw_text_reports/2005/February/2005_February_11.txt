Orca Sightings for February 11, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sure enough he picked them up (Hood Canal
Transients
) right away at Mike's Beach Resort and the "whale watching" day took off at almost
3.00pm
! They were traveling in "overdrive" again and at times one of the large females was in the lead...as if trying to keep them moving! They were somewhat nearer the west side. We watched briefly from the bluffs around 3.15pm as they were really traveling. Next we viewed them in mid-channel as they were passing Jorsted Creek about 3.25pm then we moved to Eagle Creek. Approx 3.45pm the transients moved more to the east side but left all the seals in the area alone this time.
