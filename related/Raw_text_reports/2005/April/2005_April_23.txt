Orca Sightings for April 23, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lone
gray
whale came close to shore on the incoming tide Saturday, at about

3:15 pm
. Was observed rolling sideways and blowing several times. Went under Purdy bridge (between Henderson Bay and Burley Lagoon, S. Puget Sound) and was observed by another person way up into the bay. Fly fisherman had the whale blow right in front of him and startle him.

While halibut fishing I'm almost certain our boat saw a female
Orca
, or juvenile, in Admiralty bay surface twice not far from the boat I was in. There were porpoise in the area too, but this was much bigger and a more deliberate surface. It approximately

11:00 a.m
. Also saw
Gray's
feeding just south of Sandy Pt. around

5:00 PM
.

J-Pod
Saturday night at

8:15 pm
trying to decide whether to go south through Rosario or Bellingham Channel. Ruffles came out of the water to our delight and we left them for a late dinner at Roche Harbor.

Mosquito Fleet saw 2-3
gray
whales on north side of Hat at

8:15 am
. Stayed close to surface, slow traveling, no deep diving. Then 2 more by
8:30 am further up Saratoga Channel moving north at a good clip and diving with fluke action. Caught up with Canadian whalewatchers off Darcy Island at
12:00 pm and the
transients
. (I did not get a chance to count them). Interesting behavior to note: very huddled together like residents, but longer dive times and surfacing in sync. They traveled in the middle of channel instead of along the shore. There was one mature male who stayed in the middle of the group and several younger individuals. A couple of times the group splintered off into smaller groups that formed tight diving circles, but then the group resumed their moderate traveling pace.

Windwalker Taibi called to report
gray
whales to the NW of East Pt at

8:05 pm
, & he again is observing the same whale he watched last Saturday lying on its side in deeper water, with pectoral fin & part of the fluke above the surface, its fluke looks damaged, (see Veronica's report from last night, below - a whale with notched fluke - same one?) & it has been in the same position for 20 minutes, except to slightly lift its head out of the water to breathe.

A large number of
Transients
going North in Haro St. this morning, T100's T124's and a few more. My last report was they were about to enter Trincomali Ch. about
1700
. Just before 1800 T14 was found in Haro St. going N. on a line between 10 mile PT. (North of Oak Bay) and Henry Is. JPod last reported off the Top end of Rosario (Cherry Pt. area) going slowly South, late afternoon.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters reported 2
grays
in the Clinton ferry lane, then about 1 mile off the south tip of Hat/Gedney Island, heading north at

2:20 pm
. He'd heard reports of Transients off Beaumont Shoals & J pod off Pt. Roberts.

Today while out on our sailing boat from

1:00 Pm
to
1:20 my wife Marina and I observed 2
grey
whales just East and south of Gedney (Hat) Island. We watched them for 20 minutes and got several good video shots of them surfacing. I would say we were about 1.5 off Gedney to the South and East.

We had
J Pod
up north today. They were south of Point Roberts at about
noon
, and we last saw them headed generally south east, but in no particular hurry. They were very spread out, and it appeared some were resting in their matrilineal groups, rather than the whole pod together. J1 & J2 were on the perimeter. We didn't see the baby today, but we did see it on Wednesday ... very active, even trying some little baby breaches.
