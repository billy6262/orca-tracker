Orca Sightings for April 9, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately
7pm
we saw two
orca
whales off Washington Park overlook, in Anacortes, Washington. It appeared to be a mother and calf. We watched them for about an hour. They moved from west to east, from Decatur Island all the way to Bellingham Channel, where they turned around and went back the same way they came.

A report of
T14
off William Head area south of Victoria going North East just after
1500
. Up to 8
Transients
attacking a Steller sea lion off Kelp Reef mid Haro St. at
1517
. I hope Dave or Ken at the center will give more details but my understanding was some of T100's, T124's and T90 but I was on the beach.

Dave and I had
T90, T100's and T124's
today in Haro Strait preying upon a Steller Sea Lion in the afternoon. Mallard also saw
T14
near Race Rocks in the late afternoon. It seems like there is an influx of T's lately!

This afternoon, on the west side of Haro St. off of Henry Is., on two trips, we got to see six
Transient
Orcas kill and feed on a Steller Sea Lion. It was a primal display of raw nature. We saw the sea lion tossed into the air several times, as the Orcas wore out the animal. A mature Sea Lion is a formidable animal in a death struggle, and the strategy seemed to be to tire the animal to the point that it was defenseless, and then the kill. We left them at

6:45
near Gooch Is. Also we got a report of
Orcas
off of south Lopez Is. about

4:30
, perhaps J Pod.

Saw Glacier Spirit with a
Minke
whale between Jones and Flattop Island. I saw him/her about a mile away then he/she did the "slinky Minke" trip. Lots of Harbor Porpoise in the area as well. We moved on out Spieden Channel and heard a report of seven
Transients
killing a Stellar Sea Lion near Kelp Reef. We got there about a half hour after the report and the Stellar was still alive. In fact, he decided the the Squito might be the place to ask for gastromical asylum and started swimming towards us with the seven behind him. I had to back away until he got too tired to keep up. It was a bit hard to do, but his number was up. We watched another 45 minutes and left while he was still alive.

I got a call from Kathy Danworth of MAKINPICZ telling me the
transients
were in front of her house traveling south from the Rest-A-While RV area north of Hoodsport. I managed to get out to the south end and ran into Harry & family watching them from the Union Boat Ramp as they traveled east approx
11.30 am
I believe. I retraced my steps and stopped along the way to Twanoh at the property of some new orca fans and Nan and I watched from her deck - the Slippery Six kept slipping away to the east with little top-side viewing! Moving on to Twanoh State Park I was able to spend several hours watching them split into 3 a-side groups with serious chasing/ foraging activity. (Several seals were in very close to the south shore as the transients were nearer the opposite shoreline) Interestingly - this was all just around the low tide! They did tail slaps, breaches, half breaches, "head stands," lunging and one of the juveniles kept throwing herself on her back almost level with the water... not a real "in the air" breach! They did this several times in close to the far shore as they moved gradually west. I left them as they rounded Bald Point, opposite the Union Boat Ramp about
2.30pm
.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures reported 2

Charles Peterson of Neah Bay reported one
orca
between Tatoosh & Duncan, heading west about 1/2 mile offshore.
*
three
grays
slowly moving northwestward --first sigted about a mile south of the Scatchet Head Community Club at

11:30
. Out of our field of vision at about

2:00PM
. Appeared to be feeding, since often rolled onto their sides to stir up sediments with their fins (must be a shallow area out there).

We had three
Grays
between Hat Island and Tulalip on our morning trip, around

10:15
. After traveling NE slowly feeding in deep water we left them near the Tulalip shore. On the afternoon trip we searched Port Susan and found two
Grays
off Kayak point at mid channel, then found our three from the morning trip off Camano Head. After getting a good look at their right sides I was able to Id our good friend Patch.
