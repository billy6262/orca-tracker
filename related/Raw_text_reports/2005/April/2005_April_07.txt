Orca Sightings for April 7, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
But this evening - post dusk, my bride and I are walking the queen-schnauzer on a magic slack-tide beach - full of considerable splendor - when one lone distant blow is heard - making its way towards Bells Beach. We watched, listened as he faded-away - then we walked towards the point. Standing at the very tip of Fox's Spit (East Point), transformed by the deep colors of a storm-laden northwestern sky and the quiet confusion of a combined current as it softly flows towards you - then behind and beyond each ocular periphery. It's sensory-overload! But secretly - masked by the sound of the wavelets until they were right at our feet, three adults (
grays
) - fifty feet away - like great ringing bells - blow twenty feet of sulfur and rot - and like dark mountains, silently roll half their massive bodies above the surface, flip their great flukes and then rake the night time shallows - just out of sight - until, again - the ringing of the bells! We stayed for an hour until

9:30 pm
while they fed just off East Point. Then, while walking back home - we heard two more, coming-up from Baby Island to join the fun! - That's six! Wow!

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called at

2:10 pm
to report 3
gray
whales, including "Patch" 1 mile north of Baby Island (that's about right in front of our neighborhood - of course I was in Everett!). He said they appeared to be staying in the same area. He said Tom McMillen had reported 2 grays at Possession Pt. as well.

We found 3
gray
whales sleeping 1 1/2 miles off Baby Island. Patch was one of the whales. We also found a lively group of Dall's porpoise at the North end of Camano.
