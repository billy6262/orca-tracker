Windwalker Taibi reported 2
grays
off East Pt. (Saratoga Psg, south of Holmes Harbor) at around

7:30 - 8 pm
. One of the whales was 200 - 300 yards offshore, mid-channel, & rolled on its side with its pectoral fin & part of its flukes in the air, also part of its head/mouth was above the surface of the water. It stayed in the same place for awhile, then it went under & they didn't see it again. They also noticed the flukes seemed to have some shreds in it (we did have one gray whale with missing parts of its flukes reported earlier in the season), but no fresh wounds or blood was seen. They were concerned about the behavior of the whales (they do lay on their sides often while feeding in shallow water, but this one seemed to be in deeper water, lying on the surface). Interestingly, another report from earlier in the day (see below report from Mosquito Fleet) includes observations of similar behavior in one of the grays.

Saw a young (15-20 ft long)
gray
whale, alone, just off the salsbury st. park, 20 feet off shore, which is just north of the hood canal bridge. Between

4:30 and
6:00 p.m
....watched the whale swimming in very shallow water along the water's edge north and then turn and go back toward the bridge. It was clearly a baby, according to a more knowledgeable spectator. We are very worried about the young baby, fearing the momma might have been the whale sighted in Quilcene bay and there is a pod of transient Orcas in the hood canal. No other whale was anywhere...just the little baby.

Nancy Nolan called at

1:35 pm
to report 2, possibly 3,
gray
whales off Baby Island Heights, heading south toward Bells Beach, Saratoga Passage. They were right on the shore, feeding, so close she could clearly see their barnacles! Two large whale watch boats on the scene - one arrived a little too fast & close, but later turned the engines off & watched from a distance.

2
grays
traveling/feeding in the shallows on the northeast side of Hat Island, even through the heavy rain. 2 other
gray
whales were cruising south to East Pt. One was rolling in the surf with the pectoral fin out of water! Heading home, we sailed alongside Patch who swam just under the surface as watched his shadow through the water!
