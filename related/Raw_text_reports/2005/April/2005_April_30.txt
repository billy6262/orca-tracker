Went scuba diving in Hood Canal, at a place called elephant Wall, south of Pleasant Harbor Marina. On the way back into the Marina we saw the Slippery Six!!!! (Hood Canal
Transients
) close in to shore, spyhopping, etc. ALOT of movement in one area...circling, diving, jumping (the little ones) etc. We think they were feeding but if so, then their prey was already under water by then. Watched for about 40 minutes until

2:30 p.m
. when they left. Pleasant harbor is north of Ayock point where they were seen yesterday in the evening.

Tom Berry called to report he had sighted the Hood Canal Transients at

7:40 pm
, across from Eagle creek heading south. One of the whales appeared to have an orange buoy caught on its fin at one point, but when he saw the whale later, it looked like the buoy was gone.

I spotted a pod of
Orcas
on Saturday at
6pm
. They were heading slowly West, just south of Rum and Gooch Islands (just west of Haro Strait) before they turned and slowly made their way north. I was on Rum Island so I was too far away to get any good photos for ID's. They were quite spread out, but there were at least 10-15 of them I'd guess. A few tail slaps but otherwise they were having a relaxing swim at an easy pace.
