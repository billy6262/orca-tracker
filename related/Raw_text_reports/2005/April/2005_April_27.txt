Orca Sightings for April 27, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had the pleasure of spending time watching a
grey
with lots of white barnacles on fluke roll and feed amazingly close to shore between

6:30 and 7 pm
, right off the langley shore north of town by the spit. So shallow that breathing was from above water with just a few deeper dives and blows. I was worried about stranding, but the whale was fine and swam off diving and blowing, going south at about 7.

7:00 pm to
7:45 pm
.

one
gray
whale was feeding very close to shore (less than 25 feet out), in downtown Langley. The whale was slowly making his/her way eastward through Saratoga Passage, headed for Sandy Point.

Jim Maya of Maya's charters reported
J pod
at Henry Island, headed north at a fast pace at

6:30 pm
. They had been seen as far south as Cattle Pass earlier in the day.

Early morning
reports of
J Pod
down at Cattle Point, and then around

6:00 PM
, orcas (J-Pod again?) were heading North past Sunset Point towards Henry Island. One breach as the sun was turning the water orange was a nice ending to my day.

Jpod
came together this afternoon off the South End of San Juan Island, some breeches, cartwheels, spyhops and just playing. The last few days J1 and J2 have been as much as 3+ miles away from the rest. Whales going North off Kellet Bluff this evening.

We watched a lone
Gray
for about 20 min off the North end Hat (Gedney) Is. headed toward Camano Head on the 27th at about noon. He/she was moving at about 3-4 kts blowing about every 15-20 seconds. The whale was raising length of body out of water every 5-7 blows and showing tail then diving for 2-3 min before surfacing and starting cycle again. Feeding?
