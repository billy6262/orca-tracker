8:15 PM,
Three gray whales (one of them is "Patch") are feeding in front of Langley. At one point they were all right next to each other and all had their fins and half a fluke up and then they rolled and breathed together- what a show!

My husband and I were out in our boat today on the Hood Canal and had quite a show with the Slippery Six (HC
Transients
). We entered the Hood Canal at Triton Public launch at

10:15 a.m
. and started heading south toward the great bend. We hadn't been out 5 minutes and spotted the Orcas. They were heading south down the Canal, playing and jumping and flapping their tales. We stayed with them for an hour and 45 minutes. They stayed close to the west side of the canal and then about
12:00 p.m. (noon) they started to head towards the middle and also started moving quickly towards the Potlach area.

there was a young (sub adult?)
gray
whale that I haven't seen before feeding in front of Langley this morning around

6:15 AM
. It headed back northwest at about
6:30.

About

12:30 am
, I hear our 6 coming back this way, along the west side of the Canal this time, almost below us. Tide was low, so they couldn't have been in too close...I listened for about 45 minutes as they slowly made their way toward Hoodsport.
