Orca Sightings for April 17, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
A
gray
whale was picked up by by Mark Malleson on his first trip just after
1000
. A assortment of boats had it until just after 1330 and left it at William Head. My 1400 found it coming up on Beacher Bay, we lost it, 1530. Boats from 5Star, Prince of Whales, and Seafun found it near Beechey Head going West
1600
. Last seen nearing Sooke. This whale has been "hit" along the left side of the spine towards the peduncle. The wound seems to be more of a scrape with scar tissue.
