Entry 1:
2
grays
seen just south of Clinton ferry. I was waiting in line for
0730
and PA came on notifying us of whales. Saw one whale blow twice, at end of second blow, another whale spouted a few feet away. They were about mid channel, perhaps a bit closer to Whidbey and heading south.

We followed a lone adult
gray
whale traveling south from Kayak Point in Port Susan. On the second trip it rounded Camano Head yesterday. It was moving at a good clip (6-8 knots) and fluking after every 3rd breath much to the enjoyment of the passengers! Also a flock of 20-25 pacific loons near Camano Head and 2 flocks of 25 plus western grebes.
