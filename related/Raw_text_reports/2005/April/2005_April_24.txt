Orca Sightings for April 24, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Case Inlet, South Puget Sound was visited by a mature
grey
whale, who stayed through the late night...the whale was alone, and feeding. He fed between Stretch Island and Key Peninsula (Vaughn Bay). My friend told me that he spotted a
grey
(presumably the same one) just west of Hope Island, heading north up Pickering Passage late yesterday morning. I am assuming it is the same one.

At

the slippery six (Hood Canal

The Hood Canal
Transients
made a rare visit to Seabeck today. Around
4pm
they passed by Maple Beach and Scenic Beach State Park headed north, close to the Kitsap County side. They stopped to make a kill at Oak Head, the tip of the Toanados Peninsula. The Slippery Six put on a show spyhopping, tail slapping and lots of rolling. Instead of their usual route back up into Dabob Bay, we watched them continue their course north. We lost sight of them rounding the corner of Toanados towards Bangor at around
5pm
.

Five
orcas
were seen off Misery Point (Hood Canal), heading North. They were about midway between Misery Pt. and the end of the Toandos peninsula. There appeared to be 5 in the pod, and variously appeared to be feeding, playing, and traveling at a leisurely pace. We saw some breeching, and slapping the water with their tails.

off the washington state coastline, within sight of land: 47.19 x 124.21 (aprox Cape Elizabeth) Sighted by charter fishing boat heading north to seabass fish. Whale pod size count: roughly sixty whales. Direction: headed southward at a good speed. Notes: this report provided to our charter office by the skipper of the vessel which sighted the whales; therefore this information from me is second-hand.

Elaine Wiley of Gypsy Cove, Hood Canal called to report the Hood Canal
Transients
in mid-channel, just south of Ayok Pt, closer to the east side at

11:45 am
, headed north slowly. All present, & active. One boat there, not approaching too close......and more emailed in later: The Hood Canal Slippery Six spent a good 1/2 hour just south of Ayock Point - they started out in the middle and then went more to the east side. The water was really calm so it was amazing to see what they were doing. They were tail flipping - rolling and jumping out of the water have a great time. Did not look like they made any kills - just having fun.

It was approx.

10:30 am
today 4/24 that I spotted the slippery six (Hood Canal
Transients
) just north of Dewatto Bay. VERY playful today. All were breaching, tail slapping, and rolling. I lost site from my viewing sight at approx.
11:30 and they were still heading north. They did slack off on the playfulness when a boat came speeding up on them but did not halt all together.
