============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a
grey
whale pass by at about
1pm
(Colvos passage, Gig Harbor area). We spotted another at about
6pm
both heading southward.

April 7 - 13 - We received a report from Philip on Heron Island, south Puget Sound - he reports seeing a
gray
whale feeding off Hartstene Island (just north of Olympia) for 7 days, but said it wasn't there the 14th or 15th.

I just got in from walking my dog in the backyard and heard at least one, maybe two,
Grays
blowing below our house on East Point (just so. of entrance to Holmes Harbor). They seem to be staying right on the point moving back and forth northwest to southeast toward Bells Beach. It's

10:05 pm
.

Gray
whales to report off of Langley's first street waterfront. First sighted at about

8:15 PM
one adult and one youngster (of course, I do not know how old--but a much smaller whale) feeding right in front of my office--no more than twenty-five yards from shore. They are rolling frequently onto their sides to stir up the sand with their pectoral fins. The evidence that this has been occurring regularly was revealed with the low tide when I arrived this morning--you could see over a dozen feeding pits in the sand. Also, as these two whales were feeding, another whale appeared, traveling in a easterly direction through the passage (from the same direction as the the other whales). This whale did not stop to feast in Langley, but cruised on by. The adult and youngster are still out there--I can hear them--I just can't see them anymore!!

I observed the Hood Canal
Transients
from the North Shore, at the Great Bend (Annas Bay) of Hood Canal at
7pm
. They were just beyond the Skokomish River mud flats. Not a lot of action that I could see but they were far off and I didn't have binoculars.

I managed to stick to the Slippery Six (Hood Canal
Transients
) from when I picked them up opposite Twanoh State Park at approx
1.15pm
until I left them about 5.30pm at the S. end of the Skoke Delta. Eddy Green of the Skokomish tribe had been crabbing near Belfair about an hour or so earlier and the whales were near him! At Twanoh the fins surfaced! Moving at a rather slow but steady pace westward while hugging that shoreline we watched them taking about 4/5 blows at the mirrored surface and then under for about 5 mins. When the whales appeared to be going round Bald (Ayres) Pt at 2.15pm So. of Hoodsport Eddy joined me and we got to witness at least two probable kills... several leaping dives, tail slaps galore, lunging and milling like a football "pile-on", side breaches and "head stands" and a host of seagulls all diving and swooping down and presumably picking up food scaps. At 3.50pm they started actually traveling towards Hoodsport and to the north but close to the Kitsap Penin opposite our viewing spot. Giving one last look at the Skoke area before leaving the water on the west wide I saw the whales way in the delta and nearer Hwy 106 working on another possible kill at 5.10pm.

After receiving the report below, we rushed over to Bush Pt - W Whidbey Island, to see J1 & what looked like the rest of
J pod
as they passed Bush Pt. at
5 pm
, heading southeast toward the peninsula, later spreading out between Ft. Flagler & Pt. no Point, looking like they were continuing toward south Puget Sound when we left them at
5:30 pm.
*
Deb Heg called to report a male & female
orca
between Lagoon Pt & Bush Pt, W. Whidbey Island, a little closer to Bush Pt. & the Whidbey side, & heading south at

4:40 pm
.
*
Judy Dicksion called to report she & Harry Louch had found the Hood Canal
Transients
at Twanoh State Park,

1:10 pm
, traveling west on the Kitsap side.

This morning at about

7:15 AM
we sighted a lone
gray
whale about 150 to 200 yards off shore of Manchester (47.56 N 122.54 W). The whale was heading leisurely north towards Rich Passage. I could not tell if the whale made the turn west to go into the passage, or turned east to follow the southern Bainbridge Island shore back towards the Sound.

At

8:00 a.m
. the three HC
Transients
were in front of the Hoodsport Winery heading South. A little later I saw two more pass through. Apparently they had spread out. Now they are about mid-canal hunting. I would estimate that they are about half way between the winery and the Union Marina.
