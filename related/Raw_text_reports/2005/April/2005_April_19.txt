Two

I live about a mile south of Hoodsport on the west shore of Hood Canal, a
long (15'?) shadowy shape
passing below him, headed north at a leisurely pace...almost like a small torpedo. The gull stayed put, but the shape moved north (towards Hoodsport) until it was lost behind some trees. There was no fin showing the entire time.

Around

, while shopping for groceries a rumor of
J-Pod
on the West Side (San Juan Island) was floating around. Mrs. JB looked out the window and said "yep, there are Orcas heading North past Low Island!" Several members of J-Pod were spread out and heading south very slowly.
