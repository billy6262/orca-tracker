Transients
in San Juan Channel, passing by Speiden Island towards Sentinel. They headed on over to Stuart & the Turn Point Lighthouse and then onwards up Boundary Pass. Down the West side of San Juan Island where the
K's & L's
were doing their thing. As we headed down, the whales decided to get their aerobic exercises in and started porpoising at about 10 knots towards Port Angeles. A rumor of J-Pod near Sooke headed inbound may explain their speed swim. Then a report of abundant minke whales at Salmon Bank had us heading south. We only saw one very large
minke
.

early June
Capt. Mitch Keeler called in a report of 3
orcas
following his boat north of Baja in the Sea of Cortez at Cabo San Lucas, ~20 miles offshore. The whales (a male, female & juvenile) were following in the prop wash, so close their rostrums were nearly on the boat's swim step! They followed him at about 11 knots for 30 minutes.
