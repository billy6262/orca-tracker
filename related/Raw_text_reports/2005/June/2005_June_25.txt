Orca Sightings for June 25, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Number of animals seen
- 2 (
orcas
). 1 one was a baby 18 -23 feet long & the other was big, so i am guessing it was the mom
Where did you see them?
there is a marker out front of La Push (the farthest one out) & there is Destruction Island, I was heading to Destruction on a 155 degree heading going about 13-14 knots avg, about a half hour past the La Push marker, the Orcas were heading northish on the EXACT opposite heading of mine, just tooling right along
What direction were they traveling?
335 degrees from destruction towards la push
When did you see them?
Just
after noon and before 1300 hrs
What were they doing?
just getting right along, like they had somewhere to get, just porpoising, & they were fast, on the exact opposite headin of mine, their speed & time between coming up to the top & going back down never changed, nor did their heading, for the 3- 5 minutes i watched them come at me, & then I turned my head to look back & they were gone
Playing
-no
Feeding
-no
Were there any males (very large fin on their back)?
- i don't think so, there was a "little" one about 40 to 50 feet off to her right and just slightly behind her nose as they moving along
Any unusual markings?
couldn't tell, i saw the black & white on both of them, but, they moving right along, just popping up blowing & going, Scars? - no time to tell
Have you seen whales in this area before?
no, and the guy i was on the boat said they weren't usually in the is area, that's why i'm reporting it
Did you get photos that may identify individuals?
no time.

J's & K's
passing through Cattle Pass on towards American Camp. The whales seemed to be in absolutely no hurry as they gave us what is in my top 2 passes of the year---lots of what appeared to be play activity (or perhaps it was mating activity?), lots of rolling around on top of each other, tail slapping and tail lobbing. A nice breach by Cappucino, followed by breaches by other whales all around. J26 (Mike) spent a lot of time on his back with his pectoral fins sticking straight up! At first, there were sporadic vocalizations, then as the got closer to the boat they started vocalizing like crazy! Towards the end of this pass (it took nearly 20 minutes for them to go by they were so slow), a nice spyhop from we think it was J27 (Blackberry). Several times we also observed what appeared to be feeding activity with quick lunges (although we didn't see them eat any fish).

We saw a lone
grey
at about

8:30AM
just south of Lopez Pass on the east side of Lopez. Looked like the same one reported there on the 22nd. Only in about 7 fathoms, appeared to be feeding.
