Orca Sightings for June 23, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was going to Dosewallips State Park for a beach walk this morning and about

9:10 AM
as I was driving just south of Hoodsport on 101 (headed north), I could see a number of wakes and all a sudden a "woosh" and a dorsal fin about 100-200 yards offshore! (Hood Canal
Transient
pod). They were slowly headed southward.

Transients

just north of Hoodsport, headed south ~150 yards off Hwy 101.
