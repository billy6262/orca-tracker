Spent some time with
K pod
around Eagle Pt. around
midday
. They were milling around quite slowly, quietly, changing direction often. About half of K pod went down for a deep dive about 200 yards away from the boat moving south, then surfaced within 50 feet, swimming right up to our boat; literally inches away. They circled underneath for a minute or so, surfacing often, before heading back the way they had come.
