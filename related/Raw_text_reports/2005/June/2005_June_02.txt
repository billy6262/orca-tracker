Orca Sightings for June 2, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
returned to the area with some "friends"--
K-Pod
! As we waited for the whales to arrive near Moat Point, we could see orcas spread out in large groups, with lots of breaches, tail slaps, and other percussive behavior. And once we dropped the hydrophone in the water, we were treated to the most incredible array of vocalizations I have ever heard. They were so loud and ranged from simple notes to complex combinations of squeals, whistles, and grunts. We watched the whales continue on towards Active Pass.
