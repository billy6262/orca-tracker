Orca Sightings for June 27, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about
5.15 pm
the
Six
were moving slowly towards (Maple Beach). No focused direction, no real traveling, no chasing.. with one adult female lying consistently on top of the water which was like glass... she appeared to be in a rest mode several times throughout our watch! When the older juvenile joined up first, the youngsters were rolling all over each other with Mom doing an occasional deep dive with fully arched back and coming up in the same place... like as in resting. The "kids" however were making splashes with dragging their flukes sideways across the water, some actual tail slaps. It was so peaceful their blows could be seen and heard but when the other three-some from further north came to join up we actually heard one of the younger ones' high-toned vocalizations which sounded like excitement. They continually rolled, porpoised, tail slapped a great deal, breached (backwards, sideways, etc.) and there were a lot of laying upside down with pec fins in the air and holding it for a long time it seemed. They usually were visible with part of 5 or 6 of them out of the water for periods of 15 + mins and longer. They eventually went out of sight southward, then picked them up heading into the Duckabush delta about 7.45 pm but they came back almost immediately round Quatsap Pt. doing lots of huge splashes from breaching, spy-hopping and tail slaps.
