We caught up with
Jpod
at Eagle Pt at

10:45
. We didn't get much farther north than Pile Pt. Six orcas took a beautiful pass off the stern heading west then circled back around the boat approximately 300 yards to J1 who seemed to be deeply involved in fishing considering his abrupt turns and fin wiggles. The six joined him after a few minutes and stayed under for long periods, presumably fishing also. A few spyhops, tail slaps and close-ups of J8 and J2. They were divided up into subgroups with J26 and J27 traveling close in to shore.

Josh said they had picked up the
Slippery Six early
and they had done nothing very interesting with no kills etc. for almost 4 hours. Josh said at that time the transients were near Alderbrook and just slowly moving east. Around Twanoh at
2.30pm
we saw the research boat WITH the Slippery Six! We witnessed some possible kill behavior in mid-channel north of Twanoh and the Six stayed in the area just milling around for about an hour. They slowly moved west. They headed north towards Musqueti Point about
6.00 pm
.

Today at approx.

7:00 pm
spotted the HC (
Transients
) at Dewatto. There was one large fishing boat with them and a large pleasure boat. LL stayed their distance for once. There was one small boat might have been WSFWL that came around the point at Potlatch that caught up quickly and stayed with them for about 20 minutes. They were heading North Was just off the East bank at first. Could not see really clearly. At first just seen the spouting. Then just N. of Dewatto more of the dorsal fins. But clearly all Six. They then headed closer to the middle of the canal and the West bank. Lost sight at approx.
7:30 at just past mile post 323.
