As we headed towards Cattle Pass, we encountered
K Pod & L-Pod
together! The leaders were a good two miles in front of the trailers, with whales spread across several miles from side to side as well. Good to see L-57 Faith. And we spotted a few of the new calves as well. As the whales approached Lime Kiln, they veered off from shore and most of the L's stayed down south while the K's continued North. They were in 2-3 tight groups until they passed the Turn Point Lighthouse. There they got into two tight groups and milled in Boundary Pass for awhile. Then they decided to head back down to Lime Kiln.

Kathy Cole had some hard core evidence that the
Six
had not left and Josh & Co spent a good few hours with them in late afternoon and early evening. Kathy had been with the Six south of Triton Head for about 30 mins prior to
12.45pm
where they were last seen traveling north. Josh picked them up east of Hazel Point nearer the Kitsap Penin south of Bangor Base as far as Thorndyke Bay on the west side where they had to leave the transients just starting dinner... they were killing a seal.... at about
7.10 pm
.
