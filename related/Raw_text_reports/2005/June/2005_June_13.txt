Crossing the strait from Port Townsend and entering Haro Strait 500' off Eagle Point,
whales
. As they sailed past the boats, about 300' offshore, they were suddenly surrounded by 6-8
orcas
. This was at

3:30 PM
. For the next 45 minutes they drifted staying basically in place between the current and opposing wind while the whales stayed very close to the boat, spyhopped, tail slapped and made "lazy" dives, staying under for up to 5 minutes.

Approx.

7:55 am
this morning at approx. mile post 322 (just off from the Eagle Creek Saloon) saw the slippery six (Hood Canal
Transients
) headed south and the closest I have ever seen them to the shore on the west side. At approx.

1:30 pm
they were just off from Holiday Beach headed north. Again close to the west bank but not as close as the morning.
