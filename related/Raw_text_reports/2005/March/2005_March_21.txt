Orca Sightings for March 21, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Charlene said she did see them up in Quilcene Bay, I believe around
1.30pm
. She said they were in the head of the bay foraging and then came by the rocks that protect the Marina and did some of the usual "after-dinner" play time!

We saw a
gray
whale off Blower's Bluff on north Whidbey around

11:45am
. The whale surfaced briefly right beside us. I also saw a blow later off Snakelum Point.

After getting the report below, we headed out to listen for the whales, & are 99% sure we heard 2 whales blowing off North Bluff, Greenbank at around

9:15 pm.

Windwalker Taibi called at

8:50 pm
to report hearing what sounded like 2
gray
whales passing by East Pt, Saratoga Passage.
*
We received a call from Connie Bennett of Camano Island, reporting a
gray
whale feeding on the west side of Camano Island, just north of the State Park at

2:20 pm
. They had been watching it feed for 25 minutes in the same area.
*
I just watched, at
6 PM
, a single
gray
whale half way between Langley and Camano traveling south. It was doing several shallow dives and then a deep dive. I had a good look at it in the calm water it was definitely not "patch" #49. I did not get a good look at the underside of it's fluke except to see that there was not a lot of white but there were some roundish white patches.
