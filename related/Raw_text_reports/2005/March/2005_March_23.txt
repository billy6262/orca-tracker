I met up with the NOAA researchers at Triton Cove. Launching about 10.45 am they went north in search of the Slippery Six who conveniently had "slipped" below near the Duckabush Delta leaving the researchers to forge ahead of them! Fortunately, Brian McLaughlin, Fish Biologist from the Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab and his crew George Peterson and Mark Millard were working in the area and managed to contact the researchers when they saw the whales near them. Luckily the researchers were able to return and quickly to visually "latch on" to their elusive subjects with the crews' help... about 11.30 am. Hubby Don had managed to get in some flying and saw the two boats so was circling also in the same area, thus between all of them, the Slippery Six did not slip away for the second time! The six decided to visit the Kitsap Side of the canal and around to Seabeck. I understand the Six made a kill and then continued with their "after meal" play time! This happened to involve another seal I understand, who was batted around like a shuttle cock for well over an hour....and possibly survived! John D. said the boat was stationary as they observed the behavior but with the thrown seal landing sometimes pretty near to the boat they had to be ready to move out of the way fast.... Maybe the Six wanted them to join in????? About
2.30pm
the whales started moving over towards the Toanados Penin making some deep dives and then slowly sufacing for a few breaths.

We got a report from one of our biologists working off the Columbia River of a sighting of at least 13
killer whales
including 3 adult males, and at least mother-calf pairs. Killer whales were also seen near there on
March 21 but we don't have details on that sighting.
