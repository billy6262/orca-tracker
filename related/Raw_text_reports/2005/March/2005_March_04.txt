Orca Sightings for March 4, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
About 3 minutes after leaving Race we ran into a number of
Jpod
whales including the new baby J40, westbound. Mark will be sending photos to the center for verification. Whales far apart, no sighting of J1. Contact was at
1645

Tally ho....the
whales
are still here!.....Waaaay down south mind you, west of the Alderbrook Resort, Hood Canal, an excited new
orca
fan tried to describe the ensuing antics that were being performed....but apparently it was not so much a private showing, as first believed, as the whales kept it up (at a slower pace I understand) when the research boat approached them around
2.00 p.m.
