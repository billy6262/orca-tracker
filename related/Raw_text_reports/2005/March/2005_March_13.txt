Orca Sightings for March 13, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jay at Glen Ayr Resort (N. Hoodsport) had an approx.
9.00am
sighting of the
transients
going south. Then Cindy Sund of Hood Canal Charters who lives about 2 miles north of Hoodsport reported she was out kayaking south of Dewatto Bay (Kitsap Penin side) and the whales came around foraging about
9.30 am
. Cindy said she witnessed several kills and then the whales moved north. At 10.00am they were seen continuing north passed Eagle Creek. Finally the transients appeared... as reported by phone. We watched from along the roadside until they had passed Zelatched Pt., Toanados Penin. at about 3.30pm. and were continuing north at an amazing speed. We could see many saddle patches (and notice some as quite different from the others) as they rode over the waves. At 4.30pm they were directly in mid-channel east of the Shellfish Lab then went under for a long time before we saw them entering Quilcene Bay in a traveling mode with long underwater dives and heading as if towards the head of the bay.

Tom McMillen called to report a
gray
whale off south Whidbey, between the Clinton ferry dock & Sandy Pt at

2:40 pm
, heading due west toward the shore. He called back a few minutes later to report there were
3 of them
, including "Patch" & a smaller whale. Patch is the resident gray whale with a large white patch on his right side, toward the back. Tom said it looked like there was a tear in Patch's right fluke, but they all looked healthy as far as he could see. Cascadia Research was contacted. At
3:30 Tom called back to report the whales had traveled south almost to the Clinton ferry , then turned & were heading back north toward Sandy Pt, zig zagging in & out along the shoreline.

Judy Dicksion called to report the Hood Canal Transients near Dosewallips,
2:50 pm, in the shallows, then heading north into Daybob Bay at a fast rate. She'd had reports of them down south in the Canal earlier in the morning, heading north.
