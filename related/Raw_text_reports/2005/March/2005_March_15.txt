Orca Sightings for March 15, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cascadia Research Gray Whale Survey Results - To follow up on our survey... We found a tight group of 3
gray
whales traveling south from the far northern end of Port Susan late yesterday afternoon. We stayed with them for about an hour and successfully identified three of them as whales previously sighted in Northern Puget Sound, ID numbers 44, 56, and 531. Although 44 and 56 have extensive sighting histories, 531 had only been sighted in the sound once before, in 2000. We received word of the whale entering Holmes Harbor later in the day, and unfortunately our survey in that area hadn't taken us quite far enough north to catch it, maybe next time... thanks to all who had their eyes on the water for us.
