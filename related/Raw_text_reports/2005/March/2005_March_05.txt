Orca Sightings for March 5, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
whales
passed Glen Ayr Resort, N. Hoodsport, at
11.58 am
traveling north. Cindy also continued the good news that 2 miles north of Hoodsport the whales were seen along the west shore (in close enough for photos...mind you) with lots of activity. Cindy also said there were only three of them .... ..maybe the other three were across the channel in "sneak mode!" Later Hannah of Kyak Rentals at Union, said she had heard cars were parked just outside Hoodsport (don't know which direction) but appeared a "Whale of a Show" was being held at around
11.45 am
... no more specifics.

While staffing our display at the Penn Cove Mussel Festival, I talked to a gentleman from Olympia who had sighted the Hood Canal Transient orcas near Hoodsport on his drive up to Coupeville in the morning.
