============================================================

Entry 1:
Robbie Anderson called to report seeing one
orca
at

4:20 pm
near Friday Harbor, heading north.
*
We went to see the commerant rookery on Kellet Bluff, Henry Is., and what should we find but the six (possibly seven)
Transient
Orcas that Ron Bates and Mark Mallison spotted earlier in the day from land. No boats had gotten to them during the day because of the gale that had been blowing. One adult male, one sprouter, and four to five adult females. No calves. Couldn't ID them, but did get some pictures that I'll pass on.

At approximately

5:15pm
I spent about 45 minutes watching the group (Hood Canal
Transients
) move South starting just South of Hood Point. I noticed many birds flying over one spot and then noticed the whales, lots of acrobatics, splashing and horsing around with each other. I was surprised at how much contact they have with each other and how rough that contact appeared to be at the time. Saw them throwing what appeared to be a seal very high in the air several times. The group kept moving south almost the whole time while all this was going on. The group moved past Triton cove about mid channel and continued south. After about another 10 minutes it looked like they got another seal. It looked very much like the first seal, I wonder if they would carry it with them that distance. They would flip it in the air with their tail and sometimes it looked like they would throw it with their mouths.

The
transients
surfaced 15ft.in front of our research boat just offshore of the Hoodsport hatchery this morning @
1012
. They were in 8-10 fathoms of water heading north at a good clip through rough seas.
