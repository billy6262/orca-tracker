Orca Sightings for March 22, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was out on our deck at

4:30
this afternoon when I heard the unmistakable blows of a
gray
whale. Sure enough, there was one feeding below our bluffedge. Hung around for 10 minutes or so. Lots of gull activity too. Must have stirred up the shallow waters with some tasty krill.

Linda Taylor of Depoe Bay, OR, reported that two of the Gray Whale Watching volunteers spotted 2
orcas
right off Depoe Bay, OR heading south toward Rocky Creek.
*

8:45
NW Langley, The
grey
whale is back feeding (this is the one with the tip off of the left end of it's fluke) working it's way back and forth across the shallows.

8:00 AM
. NW Langley, We just watched a third whale come by! It has a notch off the tip of the left side of it's fluke. It stayed for about 25 minutes feeding and then headed back north.

Well, fancy that, he (
gray
whale) must have turned around in front of The Dog House and come on back, because between about

8:00-
8:20
there he was again feeding in front of Veronica's place on upper First St in Langley. This time three of us (V, Deb Chapin and me) got a good look at him, and V's going to look him up. Very large, with heavily splatched white on both pectoral and fluke fins, with a notch out on the fluke. He's one hungry critter!

2

7:30am
here on First St in Langley, and two (
gray
) whales were feeding leisurely... one great big, with a white patch on his pectoral fin, and the other smaller. They were heading east toward downtown Langley, so those living on Edgecliff & Sandy Point, heads-up, they're swimming your way!
