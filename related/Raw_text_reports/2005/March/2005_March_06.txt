Orca Sightings for March 6, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dick Johnson of Glen Ayr reported possibly 5
orcas
(maybe didn't get to see the smallest) passed N. Hoodsport at
7.05 am
going south. Then Kevin Miller, with family, got to see "a group" of
transients
about
8.45 am
pass Hoodsport, move around Bald Pt (S side of Kitsap Peninsula) and on towards Tahuya. The last report had three orcas about 3 miles past Alderbrook Resort with them heading east but performing a few antics about 100 ft from shore! The location given was the 12 mile marker which possibly begins where Hwy 106 to Twanoh branches off Hwy 101..... so the whales may have been near to Twanoh State Park perhaps.... quite a way inland! Sounds like this could have been the ones who were also reported as being seen near Sisters Point (Kitsap Peninsula) at 11.15 am ...possibly on returning westward. Sounds like pretty good activity still in the south end.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters reports the
gray whale
between the Dyes Inlet Bridge & the Navy destroyer near Bremerton. He's noticing a lot of boat traffic that is unaware of the whale & tend to be going right over it.
