Orca Sightings for March 1, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spoke with fishermen at the Quilcene Marina early evening today (Mar 2) and one said the
transients
were in Quilcene Bay about
2.30 pm
and passed the marina towards the head of the bay (to the north). The other fishermen said the transients' "routine" is to go to the head of the bay as the seals and sea lions around the beach and marina will swim up there when the transients are in the area.

I had an adult male
orca
pass by 50 meters from shore here at Nootka yesterday at

16:15
. He had a big straight dorsal fin, a little wavy at the trailing edge, and was travelling at a steady pace southbound. Three breaths followed by a long dive observed twice. There are lots of sealions and harbour seals in the area right now.
