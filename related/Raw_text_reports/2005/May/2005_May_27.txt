Mrs. Malpica's 5th grade class from Mary M. Knight School sighted some

@

11:30 am
we spotted a pod of 6
Orcas
in tahwana state park in near Union. They only came within about 1/4 mile of shore.

J-Pod
was once again staying south of San Juan Island, probably to meet the huge flood tides that have been coming in. An early evening out on our boat allowed us to distantly view J's heading East towards False Bay, scattered between 1/2 mile to 1 mile from shore. We last saw the whales continuing east as we headed back to the dock.

I felt bad for the six (HC
Transients
) today. We watched them all day, and the recreational boaters have definitely discovered them.

Hood Canal
Slippery Six
were sighted across from Hamma Hamma River at

5:30 pm
Friday evening. They were moving North and putting on quite a show of coming out of the water and lots of play.

Mark Davenport reported a sighting of
orcas
at

2:30 or 3 pm
, off Fort Bragg, CA, ~12 miles out, heading north. There were 5 or 6 in the pod including 2 sets of mom/calf, & a mature male further off in the distance.

We were with
J pod
this afternoon out pretty far off the west side of San Juan Island. They were exceedingly spread out and spending very little time at the surface, although there were a few breaches and some tail lobbing. J1 spent a lot of time foraging by himself but joined up with Princess Angeline and her family and started back towards the shoreline.

12.51 p.m.
the Slippery Six (HC
Transients
) were Between Sisters Point & Twanoh. I broke out from the Skoke Delta Loop into Union around 2.10 p.m. to see the Six across the canal to the northwest appearing to be celebrating with lots of tail slaps and breaching. The research boat had already caught up with them...the whales were off Holiday Beach at 3.02 p.m. Whales passing Dewatto traveling north probably about 3.45 p.m At 4.20 p.m. They started traveling steadily north towards Holly about 5.35 p.m.

Elaine Wiley called to report the Hood Canal
Transients
passing by at ~

4:30 pm
, some on the east side, some on the west side at Ayok Pt.
*
Carol Fassett called to report the Hood Canal
Transients
north of Twanoh, heading north at

3:50 pm
. There were some breaches. There were four boats with them, one of them doing donuts.
*
Once I got to Union,

2:00 pm
, I could see that I found them. They were doing their after feeding activity - surfacing, while others did tail flaps. By the time I got back to Hoodsport, (
2:30), they were still in their playful mood. I watched them to a short while on the far side of the canal just off Tahuya. Then they started "running" North with the research boat in pursuit.

Howard Wilson called at

12:40 pm
to report the Hood Canal
Transients
between Sister's Pt. & Twanoh State Park, he wasn't sure of their direction of travel yet.

Researcher Josh London talked to a boater this morning who reported seeing blows off Foulweather Bluff this morning, no confirmation on what kind of whales or ID's, but it might possibly be the small transient group that's been sighted between S. Whidbey & N. Kitsap this week.
