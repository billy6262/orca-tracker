Steve Jeffries, WDFW Marine Mammal Biologist, with John Durban & Kim Parsons, NOAA Natl Martine Mammal Lab, Sand Point, spent a morning south Hood Canal. Around
11.50 am
I picked up the research boat coming from the south {having seen no sign of the Slippery Six (HC
Transients
) I was told} and right as they entered in mid-channel south of the Dose delta I picked up the Six coming towards them. The whales moved over towards the Kitsap Penin side heading south with the research boat in tow. I lost them at about 12.45 pm still traveling slowly south. Caught sight of The Six et al passing Eagle Creek then lost sight of them as I moved down the road. About
2.45pm
, I picked them all up near Holly, Kitsap Penin. The whales were nosing about the east side of the canal down to Dewatto at about 3.50pm and across from Lilliwaup at 4.10pm... then slowly continued south towards Hoodsport.

At
7pm
the "six" (Hood Canal
Transients
) were in close to shore and acting up near the Union Marina, and heading towards the flats. We rushed to Potlatch State Park, but could see nothing. At about
7:30, in Potlatch, boaters pointed them out to us...down at the flat. At Enetai there they were! Gradually they headed north about

8:15
.

8:15 p.m.
I was returning from Shelton. The HC
Transients
were at the mouth of the Skokomish River in an area, I think, named Indian Hole. It is a very deep part of the Skokomish Delta. I counted 5 Orcas. I am guessing the baby was also there. They must have been very active earlier as at least 25 people were stopped watching them. When I got there they were still doing jumps, tail slaps,etc. Their activity after feeding. By about
8:30 p.m. they were starting to work their way North. Since the light was failing I came home. I had also followed them as they headed South from the Dosewallips area about
2:00 p.m. They were swimming South on the far or East side of the Canal from HWY 101. A research boat was following them.

3:30 p.m. - J pod
does us the exquisite honor of passing by Lummi Island (on their way towards Rosario Strait), just as I bring my newly arrived sister who has never been here before down to the beach!! I had just finished telling her all about the legendary Ruffles and his mom Granny and their kin, when they and a few boats appeared out of the fog.

While fishing with a friend near the Scatchet Head buoy around

1:00 pm
, we spotted some blows to the southeast, probably near the Harbor Pointe area about a half mile north of a tug towing logs. We headed in that direction to get a better look and one
gray
breached about two miles south of Possession Point/Cultus Bay. They seemed to be heading north and quickly disappeared.
