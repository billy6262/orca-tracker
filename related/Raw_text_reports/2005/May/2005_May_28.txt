Orca Sightings for May 28, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were at Salmon Bank at

10:30 am
when an
orca
breached. We saw 6 plus fins in the distance forging in all directions. Minutes later, we were treated to 2 mega-breaches not 20 feet off port while in neutral. Some tail lobbing and circular diving. One male in the group and no calves.

Around
7 pm
, my husband and I (along with numerous neighbours!) sighted a small pod of
Orcas
in front of our ocean front homes. We live in Nanoose Bay, BC, just north of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island's east coast. Latitude? Guessing around 49 1/2 - 50 degrees north. There were at least three females, possibly four, and two males. One male was very large, the other a juvenile, we think. We estimate they were 3,000 feet or less off shore. For at least 20 or 30 minutes, they simply cavorted around - the males staying slightly further off shore than the females. The females were circling a small pleasure craft, as though enjoying the company! Several rowboats and/or small motor boats were also in the area to enjoy and observe the whales.
