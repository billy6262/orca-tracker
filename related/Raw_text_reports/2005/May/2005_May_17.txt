Entry 1:

evening
a ferry from Vashon stopped because the captain said there were
orcas
ahead.

J-Pod
spotted this morning near Discovery heading towards San Juan. They must have had the turbo-chargers on as an hour and a half later they were at Pile Point, heading North. They went by the house heading north fairly quickly, only to turn back around at Henry and go south.

Kathy in Seabeck reported the
Slippery Six
were giving her a "private show" right in front of their house at Maple Beach, Seabeck some time around
6.30pm
. At about 7.00 pm we were there....and the Slippery Six had not slipped away! Again they got into the "piling on" routine with lunges in all directions, a few tail slaps mainly by the youngest (with the white underside of the smallest fluke) and one mature tail slap with plenty of splash. They had generally moved more over towards the mid-channel marker out from Seabeck. We got a few more tail slaps and a spy hop from one Mom and then on NE they went in their usual traveling mode with us losing sight of their fins and blows about 7.35 pm as they turned to head straight north in mid-channel towards Bangor.
