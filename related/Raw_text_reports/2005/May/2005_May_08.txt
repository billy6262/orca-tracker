Orca Sightings for May 8, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
About 2 M. north of Alderbrook resort at

4:50 p.m
., the
transients
were sighted very close in to the shore (E side of channel). They were playing and demonstrating a bit of all the playful behaviors we most love to watch, said the earlier viewers on shore. By the time we got there at
5:00 p.m., the Orcas were directly across on the West side of the Channel. They were surfacing a lot and some tail slapping, spy-hops and other carousing for quite a while as they headed South. We probably saw all 6. My favorite part was seeing the baby jump fully out of the water 3 times.

May 7/8 - I was at Kalaloch over the weekend and we thought we saw 3 Orca's. 2 adults and a juvenile. Rethinking this we are wondering if we actually saw False Killer Whales. We saw blows, we did not see any white, and the whales appeared to be feeding.

Elaine Wiley called to report the Hood Canal
Transients
mid-channel in the canal at Gypsy Cove, headed north at approx.

8:20 pm
. She saw at least 4 of them, the water was rough so she was pretty sure all 6 were there.

Sitting on our deck, inside Triton Cove, about
10am
, we saw the (Hood Canal
Transient
) Orcas heading south. They were three quarters of the way across the canal - closer to the eastern shore. Counted at least five. Could have been six. Travelling at a steady pace. No jumping or tail slapping.

Speiden (J8), Blossom(J11), Shachi(J19), Oreo(J22), Samish(J14), Princess Angeline (J17), Slick (J16), and of course our favorite
J Pod
Mom--Granny (J2). It was a great day in Bellingham Channel as the whales spread out and came together in a random pattern. Lots of percussives--breaches, tail lobs, tail slaps as they headed towards the southern end of Rosario Strait.

Laurie Davidson called to report
orcas
between Cypress & Guemes Islands at approx.

1130-1200 - Orcas
off Lummi Island again - pod spread way out between Lummi and Clark Islands traveling south into Rosario Strait - mom and baby closer in to shore passing lucky group of kayakers, and distinctive wheezing sound of J8 in the distance - assuming it's J's. Seem to be doing their regular early season loop - they've been spotted at least 5 or 6 times passing Lummi in the last couple weeks.

Hood Canal
Transients
in the canal at

8:30
this morning. It was a joyful morning for them. Lots of breaching, rolling all together, fin slapping and headstands with tails straight up in the air. They were first spotted in front of Pleasant Harbor on the west side of the canal. They moved up to the Dosewallips and spent some time there but then headed back down to Pleasant Harbor and continued south playing all the way. We lost sight of them around
9:40 am.

Kathy, from Seabeck, called about
8.45 am
the Slippery Six (HC
Transients
) appear to be fine and were seen probably hunting off near the Dosewallips Delta. It was a good distance so Kathy counldn't verify all were there but their appeared to be enough activity for the entire group.

(Hood Canal
Transients
)! At

2:40 am
this morning, they passed just below my house on the west side of the Canal (milepost 333 on Hwy 101, across from Mesqueti and Bald Pts.), heading north. They made several HUGE splashes (they must have been totally out of the water), several tail slaps, and one noise like the sound of an oar banging against the side of a rowboat. They also twice made a totally unexpected vocalization that is difficult to describe, but was very loud -- sounded like the low, almost buzzing hum of Tibetan monks chanting (okay, okay...I said it was hard to describe). They continued on their way toward Hoodsport at about
3 am
.
