Tom McMillen called at
2 pm
, reporting the "mystery"
orcas
between Point No Point on northern end of the Kitsap Peninsula, & Scatchet Head, South Whidbey Isl. He sighted at least 3 orcas, but was not close enough to get ID's yet.

Another report from Tom at

2:30 pm
, there are 3 female or non-adult males and one juvenile
orca
, & they are now heading across Useless Bay toward Double Bluff, Whidbey Island.

At
1830
hrs, I observed a small pod of (I think ) five female
orca
approximately 2 miles SSE of the nav buoy off Scachet Head on south Whidbey. I believe there were two full grown females and three smaller ones. The smaller ones were two thirds the size of the larger ones. They were in the process of killing and feeding on a full sized sea lion. The kill technique was butting the sea lion with their heads at full speed. The sea lion was actually tossed in the air 5-6 feet several times. After the sea lion seemed dead the larger whales breached several times.
