Gray
whale sighted in the vicinity of the mouth of Ludlow Bay (just west of Hood Canal) - spotted approx.

16:00
around the red 2 nun buoy - was observed until approx

18:00 - during that time it moved towards Tala Point, staying out almost as far as that buoy too so binoculars were definitely required, s/he got kinda inside Tala point - she surfaced as far in as the Mother/Daughter houses on the hill, then s/he gave us the slip, started moving further on dives, then by luck we spotted it back out closer to the 2 nun buoy.
