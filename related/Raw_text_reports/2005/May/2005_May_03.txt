HCTransients
again up north. Spotted the six out in front of the Dosewallips at

10:50 am
. They were traveling south at a slow pace close to shore, playing and having a great time. These whales are so exuberant! It is so much fun to see them breaching, splashing, lots of white bellies and generally just having a blast playing together. I watched for an hour until I lost sight of them heading down to Triton Cove.

A nighttime visit from our 6 slippery ladies (Hood canal
Transients
), from
midnight to
12:25 am
. Heard them from my deck. They were 150' below us, on the west side of the Canal, close in to milepost 333 on Hwy 101( just north of the last house in Potlatch) They would all blow at once (counted 6), and then submerge for about five minutes, then reemerge together and blow...a few good splashes mixed in. They were heading toward Hoodsport as they finally swam out of earshot.
