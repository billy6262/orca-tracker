Orca Sightings for May 22, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
J & L pod
were reported off Eagle Pt. at

12:25 pm
, & we rushed down to Hannah Heights just in time to watch them slowly mill by, mingling & feeding & getting to know each other again. We watched from about 1-2 pm, Howie ID'd L41, L57, J1, & noticed some sprouters among the young males. We caught a glimpse of a cute little yellowish spyhop, looking like a possible new calf, also thought caught a glimpse of one of the other mom/calf pairs. Several breaches, lots of tail lobs, upside down-sideways swimming & lots of close passes & likely touchy-feely stuff going on.....with J1's studly dorsal hanging high in the middle of it all.

Ron Bates called in a report of his day with
L's & J's
- sounds like all were having a great time getting reacquainted after the winter. All males were present, L47 appears to have a new calf with her, another calf was sighted, but may have been one of the calves born last fall. The sprouters have sprouted! (young males who are maturing, their dorsal fins showing a growth spurt - sb). L12 was messing around with a young male, and of course J1 was in the middle of it all. Last report had them off Kellet Bluff heading north.
