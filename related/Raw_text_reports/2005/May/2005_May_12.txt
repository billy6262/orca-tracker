Orca Sightings for May 12, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

11:40 pm
tonight -- perfectly calm on the Canal-- could hear the blows from our "gals" (Hood Canal
transients
) passing below the house slowly (we're above Milepost 333 on Hwy 101, west side of Hood Canal, between Hoodsport and Potlatch). They might have been foraging, because they lingered for a while, submerging, then surfacing, just south of us...seemed to be heading south.

Here are some other
orca
sightings that the USCG reported to Mary Sue Brancato at our office. The USCG reported seeing today, a pod of at least 20
orca
at

10:47AM
this morning while they were on a helicopter flight about 30 miles offshore. Felt they were behaving unusual in that all were in a straight line, (head to tail not side by side). They all dove when they flew over them - at ~500ft in helicopter. The lat/long was 48 05' 0.1N, 125 21 W. Flat seas. They also saw a separate group of 5
orca
, including one small one, possibly a baby, at 1

0:35AM
at 48 06' 0.9N, 125 38W. These were acting "normal". Also flew over at 500' in helicopter.
