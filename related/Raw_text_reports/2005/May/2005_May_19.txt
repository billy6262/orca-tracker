Orca Sightings for May 19, 2005
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hood Canal
Transients
came by at
9pm
. They were in very fast travel mode and I only counted three. I think that the three were trying to catch up to the others up north and put it in high gear. They were porpoising out of the water with big splashes headed north around Oak Head, Toanados Peninsula.

While riding the

7:00
ferry from Mukilteo to Clinton tonight, I saw something huge and gray breach...twice!! -- closer to the Mukilteo on the west side of the boat. A few spouts followed then we were out of viewing range. I assumed I had witnessed uncharacteristic
gray
whale behavior but after reading your most recent report, I wonder if it was a
humpback?

Jpod
going up Haro this morning and on to Active Pass this afternoon. I was going to go west at 1400 when I got a report of 5
orcas
going towards Kelp Reef from Lime Kiln. These whales were not found but I searched all of North Haro. A report of a
transient
off Otter Pt. just past Sooke at about 1530. Next came a report of 2 transients, both male, 1 large one not so big. These animals were 5.25 miles south of Secretary Island (near Sooke) going towards Race Rocks, this was
1845
. I assume the Otter Point whale may be one of these 2 but?

J-Pod
decided to head up North towards the Penders (Islands that is). We had a brief but beautiful encounter with the J's as they entered Active Pass and hugged the left shoreline.

I'm new to the Pacific NW, so I'm not sure what kind of whale I just saw. At
7 pm
a very dark gray/black mammal going west towards Bremerton by Point White on Bainbridge. Single animal. Surfacing frequently, more frequently than I might expect. Posterior fin looked like a fish, kind of ragged edges, smooth bottle-nose-ish. No white seen, not a glossy black, a dark gray or matte black. Very close to shore of Point White. Could be a dolphin, although seemed much bigger than any dolphin I've seen, and much darker, plus I don't recall posterior fin like that on a dolphin. No huge dorsal fin, I think a small one. We've seen two orcas traveling together in January or so here, same route.
