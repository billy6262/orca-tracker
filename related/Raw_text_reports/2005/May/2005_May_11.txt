The Slippery Six Hood Canal Transient
Orcas
at

8:00pm
. We initially spotted them almost mid-channel off of Red Bluff (across from Hoodsport to the northeast on the East side of the Canal). A few jumps, many tail slaps, the younger ones were coming up and out of the water a bit and rolling back under. They didnt seem to be in any hurry. By
8:20pm they were directly off of Cougar Spit (across from Hoodsport) and approximately 200 yards off the eastern shore of the Canal. At this point we saw one of the larger orcas taking up the rear about 100 feet behind the others. By
8:30 pm they were beginning to fade from view into the distance, again almost mid channel and just south of Hoodsport.
