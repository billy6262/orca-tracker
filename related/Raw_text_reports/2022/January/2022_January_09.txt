13:31-

Center for Whale Research Encounter #1: "Sure enough, when they got alongside that first bull, Mark instantly recognized a rapidly sprouting
J39
. Always on the small side for his age, it seems that in his 18th year J39 is finally growing into his years.
J38
was seen closer to the Galliano shoreline chasing a salmon and appeared successful in his efforts as several gulls followed behind him to pick up a few remaining scraps. Over the next hour, Mark, Joe and George were able to confirm
all of J pod but J19, though she was likely present
in the large spread." [See CWR Encounter #1 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-1 for full summary and more photos] photo - "

SRKW J pod heading north in Trincolmali Channel

Entry 3:
Rosario Strait (T49A1 & T49A2) -

16:00 -
I took these tonight from Rosario Beach right before sunset (4PM). It was amazing! I've never gotten to see them in the wild! There were
4 individuals
that I saw, and I'm not sure where they headed. They surfaced in that general area for about 15 minutes and then we lost sight of them. -Ashley Czebotar

Entry 4:
NW Strait of Georgia -

12:10-~

14:10 - Two Humpback whales off Harwood Island
. Trying for photos for ID. At lunchtime there were two Humpback Whales heading north to Harwood Island from Texada Island (the same whales [as morning sighting], who knows?). These whales kept going back and forth along Harwood to the north end of Texada. From there the whales moved on to Savary Island. We left them around
2:10 P.M. at Hernando Island. -Patti and Mark Perepeluk
*

09:04 - Two Humpback Whales travelling north toward Comox from Denman Island
. We are still seeing Humpback Whales here regularly. Viewing from my house this morning, I saw two Humpback Whales travelling north from Denman Island toward Comox. Mark and I jumped in our vehicle shortly after
9:00 A.M. to see if we could get a closer look. We did not see them from a closer vantage point in Comox, so we made our way further in hopes of spotting them. -Patti and Mark Perepeluk

Entry 5:
South Puget Sound - [HB/Mn]
At approximately
15:30 on

Entry 6:
Dougall Point in Case inlet
), I observed what I believe to be a Minke Whale while under sail in a small boat. The whale was in the vicinity of large groups of California sea lions, and breached only for a few moments each time heading south. It was a small whale with a pronounced dorsal fin. Too small to be a humpback or gray. Behind the dorsal was smooth. The whale moved quickly and hugged the edge of a fog bank but I managed to get video with my 600mm lens when it first breached near one of the Cali sea lion, harbor seal, harbor porpoise groups. The second breach was much closer and I got a great look at its broad side and back despite the thick thick fog. After that I saw one more breach farther south heading deeper into the fog along Harstine as the sun set. Follow-up:
Looks much more like a humpback
now that I see it on the big screen. (I've only ever seen large slow humpbacks in the Antarctic so it's still very exciting.) -Kevin Lester

Entry 8:
Saratoga Passage -

16:00-

16:45 -
Viewed from
Fox Spit and Baby Island Heights
. First seeing Little Patch out from Bells Beach, Whidbey side; he traveled north and came pretty close to Fox Spit as he rounded the point angling out a little bit. He then was heading for Baby Island where I last saw him from around
16:45. I have no idea where his mysteryess went. they split up sometime from
14:30 or so until I saw him again at
16:00.

11:00 -

Entry 9:
2 Gray Whales
in front of my house just south of
Mabana
. They were out a ways, past the drop off, traveling slowly south. Beautiful calm, sunny day so the blows lingered in the sunshine. Follow-up: Sorry, but the whales were too far away for any photos. I know that Little Patch has been around, and I was hoping you would know the ID of the second whale! Earlier in the morning, I had seen disturbance in the water surface clear across by Saratoga Woods. I had been sort of keeping an eye out, so I wasn't totally surprised to see a Gray, but I was surprised when I saw the second Gray at the same time. Hope someone has a photo for ID. -Barbara Brock

10:00 -
We saw the grey today! It was way over by
Priest Point
. Normally when we leave the Port, we head south down river but decided since the tide was so high to go north. So glad we did or we wouldn't have been able to see show! We had a spy-hop as well but wasn't quick enough with my camera. A little after 10am. -Michele Sayed, Hat Isl. FB group

I have attached a few photos of a
Minke whale
I saw yesterday evening. It was feeding in
Shilshole Bay off of Golden Gardens
and the marina. My husband and I watched it from our sail boat from 4pm till about 6pm. It surfaced 2-3 times every 10ish minutes. First time over ever been able to get photos of a Minke! -Hannah Swanson

Entry 11:
North Puget Sound/Holmes Harbor -
I am quite certain the sightings this morning in Holmes Harbor are those of
Harbor Porpoise
as opposed to Orcas. I photographed them all morning because they had beautiful sprays every time they would surface. I will include some verifying photos. Follow-up: It was fascinating to watch these harbor porpoises and their strategies for "fishing". They were right off our dock, many of them, and I could see they would circle the, what I assume to be fish, then do body rolls and slaps to stun them then they would all submerge and have their feast until the resurfaced to start again. It was fascinating to witness! I spent the entire day photographing and just watching. Needless to say I didn't get much else accomplished on Sunday. Had there been Orcas that day I know I would not have missed them. I never stop looking!!! We are new to the area and very recently purchased the Holly Farm and 4 times have seen Orcas in the harbor by our dock. To me, there are few things more exciting than watching and photographing these amazing creatures! We happened to be in Langley a week or so ago and to our surprise saw our first Grey Whale here! I nearly jumped in I was so excited!!!!! -Jan Willis
*

09:45 -
Approx. 4 orcas now headed north.

08:45 -
ON staff members & volunteers are seeing report on local group of orcas spotted,
08:45, and still there after

Holmes Harbor

Entry 12:
[Fin whale] We saw it from Carkeek
,
January 9, and also thought it was a minke. How cool! -Stacey Peterson Glyde
*

13:00 -
I took these pics from the top of the
Carkeek Park
train overpass. Anyone have an ID? Had quite a long back and the fin was pretty far towards the rear. -Jack Riley
[
"Looking at your photos, I personally think this is actually
a rare Fin Whale
" -Justine Buckmaster, marine naturalist] [confirmed by John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research Collective and Jared Towers of Fisheries and Oceans Canada. -ON
]
photos - "This photo is especially convincing to me. You almost never see a Minke exposing neither the blowhole nor the dorsal fin like this! Their backs just aren't long enough. I have however seen this from a
Fin Whale
!" -Justine Buckmaster
