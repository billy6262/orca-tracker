Orca Sightings for January 16, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T30s, T41s) -

11:52-

14:05 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #3: "The animals were quickly identified as members of the T030 and T041 matrilines, not an uncommon association. The T030s are not as common as they once were in the inside waters of the Salish Sea, and have not been seen in the Juan de Fuca Strait for quite some time, though the T041s are relatively common in the western and central portions of the Strait in late summer each year." [See CWR Encounter #3 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-3 for the full summary, more photos, and a video]

08:15 - Bigg's calls on Orcasound Lab hydrophone
. Just noticed and verified as Bigg's ecotype, a human detection of very faint orca calls via the Orcasound - Listen for Whales web app. -Scott Veirs, Orcasound/Beam Reach
*
FIN WHALE - Fin whale confirmed in Puget Sound: "I think based on the range of photographs we have seen, we are pretty comfortable confirming this whale is a fin whale." -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research Collective
*
"Thanks so much for passing these along! I really appreciate it and agree with the diagnosis. I suppose it's the
first fin whale documented in the Salish Sea in January and only the third individual ever in Puget Sound
. The minke/fin debate got me thinking as to how rare it may also be to see a minke in the Salish Sea in January." --Jared Towers, Fisheries and Ocean Canada

Beautiful whale! I parked my paddle board off Golden Gardens last Sunday 1/16 at 2 pm-ish and she surfaced two times off my board, 23 seconds in between. Here is the best video. Parked, no approach. A very awesome and jaw dropping experience. Beautiful creature. -Rachel Olsen
