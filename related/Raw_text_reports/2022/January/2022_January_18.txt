Orca Sightings for January 18, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saratoga Passage (Js) -
Beautiful evening listening to J Pod as they travelled south past Glendale Beach, fairly close to shore. Hearing them in the calm water under the dark sky was a first for me - totally magical. [video] https://www.facebook.com/OrcaNetwork/posts/10166340405225601 -Dori Dace

20:10-

20:25 - Passing Glendale
. Their
blows
are the best sound, brief glimpses of them as well.

18:40 -
Sounds like another group passing by a little further offshore. Guessing these are the trailers.

18:30 -
A much larger group just passed by now still headed southbound, still seem to be favoring Whidbey side.

18:20 - Southbound past Sandy Point
. You can see them under the moon and city light, hear the blows and tail slaps.

17:00 - [orcas]
There's so many! Very spread out. Nonstop blows filling the air. Trending south.
----When the call came in, whales northbound at Hidden Beach at 4pm, I immediately headed out. They were at least headed my way, so I might have a chance to see them before dark. The next update had them southbound near Baby Island, which meant committing to Fox Spit, an additional 25-minute drive. That also meant rushing to get there before the whales passed, as well, before dark fell. Disappointed, I arrived after the first group had passed by. I had a feeling there were more, when all of a sudden, whales popped up like popcorn everywhere off
Fox Spit
! An unexpected surprise from
J pod
(seriously, where did they come from and where did they go?!) It was nearly dark, at this point, so not many photos. The viewing conditions were perfect, no wind, calm water, and the sound of their blows carried far over the water. I was loving the way they were sounding, so I decided to follow them as long as I could. I parked off
Sandy Point
and waited for an hour before the sound of blows filled the air. The bright nearly full moon peeked above the clouds at this moment, and you could see them swimming under the moonlight, pretty incredible. You could hear them for nearly 30 minutes. I was just too enthralled by the sound of their breaths that I wasn't ready to say goodbye. I messaged Dori and told her to head to Glendale because hearing them was just TOO cool. I grabbed some dinner then headed to Glendale. We sat for 45 minutes before hearing the sound of blows. You could see some of them somewhat close to shore surfacing in the bright lights reflecting off the water's surface. We listened to their blows for nearly 20 minutes before the world got quiet again. It's a night I won't be forgetting any time soon. photo -

16:30 - [orcas]
I can see and hear them from CSP [
Camano State Park
]. Still too far for a pic or video.
4:30.
Trending south

17:05 -
Leaving them at
5:05, they're still heading south and seems like they're in
between East Point & Bell's Beach
now.

16:56 -
I'm way over at
Camano Island SP
, so it's hard to get a great ID photo from here, but it's seeming like open saddle patches & resident eye patches.

16:46 -
They're milling right now, right in front of the houses along
Saratoga Rd
. (
4:46)

16:40 -
Still just south of Rocky Point, although I think a couple are down by
East Point
by now. (
4:40).

16:32 -
There are 5-6 more now. I think there are still 2 a little south of Rocky Point and ~6 in
between RP and Baby Island
now, including a big male and a little one.
Heading south
.

16:20 - Right now they seem to be milling in
between Baby Island and Rocky Point
. I'm hearing more blows than I'm seeing, though, so I'm wondering if there are more on the other side of the point.

16:11 - [orcas]
Just spotted them. Heading south, just passing Baby Island. I think 2, and it looks like one male. -Sara Montour Lewis

we just saw 2, maybe 3, orcas
heading north in Saratoga Passage just north of Hidden Beach
, Whidbey side.
3:40pm, 1/18/22. -Patricia Phillips

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound -
The day got away from me but I saw the
humpbacks in Case Inlet
. Between 11 and 1 off the south end of Herron Island viewing from Harstine State Park. I feel like there are two. -Stacey Crofoot

Entry 3:
Haro Strait -
Here are a few clips from this morning of the Grey Whale that has been foraging on the west side of Haro Strait for over a week now. It is currently off of
Ten Mile Point in Cadboro Bay, Saanich
, at the southeastern tip of Vancouver Island. Last week it was spotted off of Glencoe Cove in the neighbouring Gordon Head district. -Gerald Graham
[
This gray whale has been newly designated as CRC 2240 by Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective. -gs/ON

11:54 - Gray whale
blows far out on the
Canada side of Haro Strait
, moving down island to the S/SE. Large blows, straight up, easily seen against the shore of Vancouver Island, on a dark gray day. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 4:
Saratoga Passage -
I saw this one too [Steven Nantz's sighting below]. Blow was very diffuse - quite different from what I've seen in other whales. Body was long with small curved dorsal fin. Swim behavior did not resemble Orca or porpoise. Regardless of exact type, so awesome to see! -Kristi Ingram
*
Single, small (15 ft or so) dark-skinned whale - not sure of species - with spouts, seen off Indian/Blomquist Beach just now. Roughly 100 yards out. Heading south towards state parks. Dorsal fin curved, tapering to point. Pilot whale perhaps?
Edit: I'm not positive but reasonably certain that is what I saw [response to minke photo example]. Wasn't that far out. I don't think it was an orca, but since I am fairly new to the art and science of whale watching I could be mistaken. The exhalation- the spout- was faint but visible. The
dorsal looked like that of a minke
. -Steven Buckley Nantz
