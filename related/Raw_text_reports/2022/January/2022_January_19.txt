Follow-up: Couldn't tell [how many] for sure. Very far out for our binoculars. At least 5, I'd guess. They've gone under so searching again for them. Closer to Pt. Townsend than Fort Casey. -Jered Phipps

South Puget Sound -

Still playing in the channel Just north of
McMicken Island
. The whale and the raft of sea lions that has been hanging around for the last week are playing cat and mouse. Guessing that herring or anchovies are running through there right now. -Eric Bergson
