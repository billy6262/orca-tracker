In follow-up call w/reporting party: Hope Nelson, by description, can confirm
humpbacks
(large whales, small irregular dorsals, tall blows). They were heading northbound just south of Pt. Defiance. She did not see if they rounded toward Owen Beach, but thought maybe, since they were hugging PT D shoreline. As reported possible there were 3, just as possible she saw one surface twice in quick succession. -Hope Nelson
We have alerted WS Ferries and will update WSF and commercial shipping with any current updates. -alb/ON
