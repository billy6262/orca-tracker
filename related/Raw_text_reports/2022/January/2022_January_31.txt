This general vicinity [mid channel, north of

Entry 2:
SW Haro Strait -
Latest sighting of
Grey Whale CRC 2440
, filmed at
12:18 PM PST on Monday,
January 31, 2022 off the southeastern shore of [Vancouver Island], Haro Strait, in the Ten Mile Point area of
Cadboro Bay, Saanich
, British Columbia, Canada. [video] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbwGo6K4a1g -Gerald Graham photo - "Here's a photo of the Grey's fluke, for ID purposes."
Addendum to Gerald Graham's Jan 31 report: PS - That same afternoon there were in fact
two Greys just off of Ten Mile Point
at the same time. They were observed simultaneously by a whale watching skipper from a point on land. Thus, there was the Grey in my video, plus what was probably a juvenile, entering Baynes Channel from Haro Strait. Original report: Latest sighting of
Grey Whale CRC 2440, filmed at
12:18 PM
PST on Monday,

My whale drought has ended, thanks to at least one gray whale in its usual spot near Camano, immediately in front of the homes at
