Going back and listening to the audio stream from the LK webcam, it sounds like

Not the greatest pics, they were pretty far away and kept a low profile, but that bouncy babe was super cute! -Marla Smith

Entry 5:
S Rosario Strait/Fidalgo Island - ~

12:10 -
There's a
gray whale in Burrows Bay
. Started watching around
12:10pm, but I've got to run to WA Park to teach class [Salish Sea School], so I can't stay. I caught a couple heart-shaped blows, about 3 minutes apart and bird activity on the water. Dark back, no dorsal, but ridge instead. Light is too contrasty to make out much else and I was too far for photos. It looks to be headed S, SE, but mostly just milling in that one spot. -Amanda Colbert
