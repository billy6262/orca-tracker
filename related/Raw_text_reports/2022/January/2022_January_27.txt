January 27, 2022: First sighting of the year! With Whidbey fog-free at last, the breath-taking spectacle of this group of
orcas southbound in Admiralty Inlet
, the sun enhancing their backlit blows, was more than welcome. Not sure who they were, just enjoyed the moment and the mystery (photos R J Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard

15:15 -
Lots of interference noise on the
Bush Point hydro
but pretty sure I'm hearing some
echolocation
. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*

17:30 -
A lucky glimpse of
three orca dorsals about 5 miles out from a mile south of Bush Pt
., looking toward Hood Canal. One dorsal was more of a triangle than curved, which looked more like a Bigg's than a Resident. I didn't see any others. -Howard

16:59 -
Just saw 3 or maybe 4, including a calf, swimming VERY SLOWLY southward,
1 mi. south of Bush Point
. Watched them continue south VERY VERY slowly, may have caught a glimpse on video, these must have been the trailers as it looks like others saw them further south. -Susan

15:10 -
Our neighbors Kate and Sim Sheppard, are watching 8 or
9 orcas headed south from a beach at Bush Pt
. - sounds like they were north of the Wharf bldg. at that time, but 10 mins. later were south of the wharf, still headed south. -Susan Berta & Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

15:07 -
Listening to the hydro [
Bush Point
] and there are some faint
orca calls and echolocation
, but it's being drowned out by heavy ?boat? noise. -Ariel Yseth
*

14:55 -
Anna SinghDeo & Pip Gordon called to report seeing
at least 10 orcas
(1 bull, 7 other adults, and 2 little ones) in the cove just
south of the Bush Point Lighthouse
. Whales are heading southbound on the Whidbey side in no hurry. They were viewing from the Bush Pt. launch, whales directly out. Backlighting made impossible to see details such as saddle patches...

A trusted friend reported by private text, 11 a.m.:
~6, southbound Ft Casey
... Be on lookout. Sorry, no further details. -Paul Belanger
