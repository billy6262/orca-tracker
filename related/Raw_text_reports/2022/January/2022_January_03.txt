17:15 -
At dusk I ran down to a beach that is just a tiny bit south of Lisabuela in hopes to check one more time to see if I could find him, but by the time they passed me it was just a bit too dark to make out dorsal shapes with full confidence, but, around
5:15pm they did pass me in
Colvos

My wife, Sandy, and I were out at Dune Peninsula for a walk today. Glad to see the snow was gone. Anyway, we saw some people with cameras and binoculars and found out they had seen
humpbacks in Commencement Bay
and said
orcas were on their way from the north
. We went ahead and walked over to
Owen Beach
, and when we got back there were more people gathered at Dune Peninsula. We lucked out and saw some orcas. They were much further out than the humpbacks we saw the other day. -Kaz Griffin

13:12 - J pod passed Point Robinson
, grouped up, travel mode
southbound
, island side of channel, powering through the sunshine and Salish chop. Silent pass, though, on the hydro.
----Monday's pass, though, we got pretty lucky, as there was a hot minute of glorious sunshine to watch them in between squalls, but also meant bone chilling wind. The sea was extremely choppy, hiding saddle patches in the folds of the waves while the wind stole away their spouts. Hard conditions to track them in, but luckily, they made a bee line to the point and came in for a close-ish pass.

Entry 8:
South Puget Sound -

09:45 -
I saw a whale for the first time in
Henderson Inlet
out my back window. Been trying to figure out what type it was for the past two hours. It was gray but only saw the back end before tail went up. Watched for ten more minutes, it didn't come back up. Follow-up: It was
9:45 am when I saw it while on a work call. I am about a 1/4th of the way in on Henderson Inlet, and it was heading south based on the back and tail direction. I didn't see any blow....just looked out and saw a large gray back arch and then the tail go up before it dove. It was big!
