Orca Sightings for January 26, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
S OR Coast/Port Orford (Ks) -
Yesterday a friend of a friend of a friend forwarded me a text of an Oo [Orcinus orca] sighting from a small boat off of Port Orford that stated "
about 10 orcas
playing with a spider man baloon (sic)", included this photo of two males swimming north. No time mentioned, nor in photo metadata. The best I can do with IDs is to presume they were K-pod, and that those two were K26 and K42. Is there enough there to ID them? I'm trying to track down the Spiderman component, while wondering how a salmon in the mouth could appear like a silvery mylar balloon with red graphics... Jeff K. Jacobsen

We saw a (the?)
fin whale in Burrows Bay
briefly @ 6pm on Wednesday 1/26/22. Based on the animal's size, dorsal fin shape and the very large vertical spout, we are 99% confident this was the fin whale that has been spotted in Puget Sound recently. -Rachel Bergman
