Entry 2:
SE Vancouver Island -
There have been some unusual visitors in these waters lately-
Risso's dolphins
. These unique cetaceans are typically found offshore where they can dive up to 1,000 feet and hold their breath for almost 30 minutes. A small group of them have been seen
from Campbell River down to the Canadian Gulf Islands
in recent weeks. -Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

Check out this beautiful video by Jason [Shields] of the
~20 Risso's in Saanich Inlet
yesterday [1/29/22]. Despite being unusual visitors here, the dolphins looked healthy and were very active, perhaps finding an unexpected source of squid to keep them hanging around the Salish Sea! https://www.facebook.com/orcabehavior/posts/2804497803187528 -Orca Behavior Institute video - Jason Shields
