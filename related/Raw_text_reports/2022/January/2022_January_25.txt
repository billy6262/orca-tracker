Orca Sightings for January 25, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Burrard Inlet/Indian Arm (T86As, T124As, T124A2s, T124Ds, +)
Addendum to original report: Jared Towers, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), notes from Haley Crozier video of
January 25 regarding new calf
T124D3
(and IDs) -alb/ON: "Yes, it looks like who Sara has IDed plus the
T086As
and others too. I can confirm that
T124D has a new one named T124D3
."
Original ID notes by Sara Hysong-Shimazu for Haley Crozier's video: Looks like the first mom and calf to surface is
T124D and a new one
. Not 100%, but nearly sure.
T124A
and her new one appear to be the second mom and calf to surface.
T124A2s
are the last three to surface. 13 (if I'm counting right with the
124As, 124A2s, and 124Ds
). Can't tell if 124A1 is there, but she travels separate a lot. There are others because no grown males in that family, but I can't get a good enough look at the male to say whoï¿½.Actually BIGG'S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - looks Like the T86As might be in there, too.

BIGG'S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Tue, Jan 25. -
Burrard Inlet/Indian Arm (T86As, T124As, T124A2s, T124Ds, +) -
I've attached a google drive link to a video file taken yesterday on Indian arm, BC of a pod of approximately 20 orcas heading north. They appeared to be feeding on herring. There was one, possibly two very young babies in the group. They still had the red/brown staining on their white patches. We're pretty certain they're a resident pod (broken saddle patches, vocalizations heard), potentially j-pod since I saw there were 2 pregnant females in the fall. If you could confirm my suspicions as well that would be super exciting!

Entry 2:
Haro Strait -
Update: The
Haro Strait Grey Whale, aka CRC 2440
, is still foraging off of
Glencoe Cove/Kwatsech Park in Saanich
, on the west side of southern Haro Strait, two weeks after being first spotted there by a local inhabitant. Here's my latest video clip of this solitary animal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rrDOD19_do - Gerald Graham

Judy and Tom Knowak called to report a large full-size
gray whale
feeding ~10 feet from shore off
Mission Beach, Tulalip
. Blasting in the sand, feeding then circling out and back for more.

Entry 4:
Central Puget Sound - ~

17:00-

17:30 -
Possible fin whale sighting. We are pretty sure we just saw a whale from
Sunset Hill Park
...light wasn't great & it was far away, but there was a very long, linear object that couldn't really have been anything else. It would appear, stay visible for 30 secs to 1 min, then disappear (without fluking) for about

1:30-
1:45. Was about 1,000 meters west of the
N end of Shilshole
. Was staying more or less in the same place. I would say we observed a total of 8-10 surfacings. It was clearly very big, so likely the fin whale that was seen off Shilshole recently? Wasn't humpback-like behavior, and seemed too big. Only weird thing is we couldn't see a blow, but it was far & light was weird. Sighting time was around 1700-1730. Passing along in case 1) you can shed any light, and 2) you want to pass along to Orca Network folks. -Michael Dougherty, E via Scott Veirs
