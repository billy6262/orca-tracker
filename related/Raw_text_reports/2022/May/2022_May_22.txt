NOAA Fisheries West Coast Facebook Post : Thank you to NOAA West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network teams, especially Feiro Marine Life Center, Cascadia Research Collective, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Police Marine Mammal Investigations. They worked throughout the night on May 23rd and into the morning to monitor a killer whale in an unusual and potentially dangerous location.The transient orca, now identified as T65A5, entered a canal leading into a small lagoon at a paper mill in Port Angeles, WA. To get out, the animal had to return through the canal under a busy bridge. We were concerned that the whale would not find its way back, especially before low tide. Our Marine Mammal Stranding Network teams were deployed to help. Thankfully, the whale found its way out.We do not post details of events like this in real time so that responders can work without crowds and interruptions to assist the animal. While this whale freed itself, only trained responders should attempt to intervene.As a reminder, if you see an animal in distress or on the beach, please call the West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline at 1-866-767-6114.

Orca Behavior Institute Facebook Post: A bizarre event unfolded last night in Port Angeles Harbor! A young orca made it's way through a small channel and into the lagoon by the McKinley Paper Company deep in at the west end of the Harbor. This area is shallow enough that at low tide, the lagoon is cut off from the Harbor.You can see a video of the whale here: tinyurl.com/paharborwhaleThe whale stayed in the lagoon overnight, but the Feiro Marine Life Center thankfully posted this update this morning:"The orca has left the channel and returned to the Harbor and likely back to the Strait. Agencies are continuing to monitor the situation....We appreciate all of the support you give Feiro and the rest of the certified marine mammal stranding responders. Our staff have been on site literally all night long."From the photos and videos we've seen, it appears the whale was T65A5, the 8 year-old male that has been periodically off wandering on his own since age 4. We actually saw T65A5 yesterday with the rest of his family further to the east, so he must have wandered off again sometime later in the day yesterday. Only time will tell where he will show up next and what new adventure awaits this unusual whale! -Orca Behavior Institute*Mon, May 23 - Puget Sound (T65As and T64Bs) - 19:33 - [orca] At least three of them are off Alki Point, west side of channel. - Michelle Olsen*18:05 - Watching from Valley Street on Bainbridge.
