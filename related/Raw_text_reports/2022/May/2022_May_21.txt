Maybe he got frisky with T64B, and she wasn’t in the mood? He also had a fresh scar above his right eye patch from earlier this week too. These are scars that are common with these animals, and it will likely heal up without any issues over time. The photo is cropped in significantly to show the detail big enough. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express*Southworth Point this past Saturday. Members of the T64Bs and T65As passing Southworth PointI have other great shots as well if you can tell me where to send them.

When they were porpoising towards PR they were all grouped up together then went for some verrrry long dives and split into loose groups as they passed. Numbers looked too big to be just the 65A's but only saw the others from a distance. T65a5 threw me as he looks to be sporting a new nick on his trailing edge?

They came up from the south, somewhat spread out, with the big fella bringing up the rear. They milled around for about 30 minutes or so before turning around and heading back southward. It was a little hard to keep them all straight, but there were probably 3-4 with the curved fins and then the one larger male with the very upright triangular fin. I took photos, but it was very far away and the light was fading...I saw our local seal cruising back and forth not more than about 4’ from the beach while the orcas were around, so I know it was likely a nervous little seal but staying safe. 20:45 - Just watched prob 4-6 in northern Saratoga - out from Mariners Cove/N.Oak Harbor/Whidbey.

Back to my pal 2440, Double-Hump. In addition to the northbound pass by the beach here at Mariners’ Cove around noon, it came back heading south and chowing down like crazy. This was one of the slowest feeding visits ever – lol! I’m attaching some photos and drone footage from around 4:40pm, but it was here for probably at least half an hour as it progressed in a very leisurely way down to the Happy Meal Mudflats and on toward Polnell.12:37 - There are two at southern end of Mariners Cove - midchannel...2440 heading north up the beach. So fun!12:31 - Missed one! Looks like 2440 is right outside by the beach!12:20 - Upper Saratoga grays - there appear to be two grays in upper Saratoga still.

This mixed pod of 6 Bigg’s killer whales was swimming into Puget Sound near the north end of Marrowstone Island when the Chilkat Express, and the Saratoga arrived. The pod spread out into stealth mode looking for prey in a prominent tide rip that often forms off Marrowstone Point. The moms, T137 (Loon) and T36 (Flapjack) were in the lead and Loon’s daughters, T137B (Tempest), and T137D (Wright) were in formation close by. Loon’s adult son, T137A (Jack) was trailing way behind by about a quarter of a mile and the rest of T36’s pod, the T36Bs, were even further behind socializing with members of other pods. We could tell the chase was on when the girls started porpoising (speed swimming) towards something out in front of them. The speed of their chase indicated their target might have been a harbor porpoise. It didn’t take very long before they slowed down and started circling. We never saw what they caught, but Jack’s exuberance from a quarter mile away helped indicate their success. He started celebrating/communicating with tailslaps first, and then he breached 4 times in the distance! We floated with the engines off watching the 4 girls circle around their prize as Jack swam in to catch up. Along the way he swam towards us and breached another 4 times in a row! Shortly afterward his sister Tempest answered his breaches with 3 breaches of her own and one of them coincided with mom spyhopping at the same time. Loon spyhopped a second time right as her son finally reached the breakfast zone! Later in the trip, after spotting a gray whale and a minke whale we finally found the T36B pod mixing it up with T65, T63, the T65A pod, and others near Point Wilson. I posted one of Jack’s full breach sequences on my instagram@bartrulon if you are interested in seeing it. All photos were taken with a supertelephoto lens and cropped, and all whale watching regulations were followed. -photos by Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express, May 14, 2022*HUMPBACK WHALES - Sat, May 14 – Juan de Fuca Strait - TODAY off Sheringham Lighthouse with two humpback whales.

This was a repeat customer, the same one we’ve seen several times this week/year. It showed up at 8pm and was feeding as it went by, sticking its fin further up out of the water than I’m used to seeing, so that was fun. No stealth whale this time – lol!
