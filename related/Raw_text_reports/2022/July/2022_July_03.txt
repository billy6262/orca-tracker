============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's Killer Whales -

Entry 2:
T72 has the nickname 'Young'

Entry 3:
But this is just one part of the story! T72 along with the T34s (minus T34A1) and T37s, and T37A1 came down Admiralty Inlet, visiting northern Puget Sound and then eventually Camano and Whidbey Island. Bart Rulon paints the picture so well, read his excerpt below:

Entry 7:
"We had a great 4th of July weekend watching whales and it was especially interesting because of an unusual mix of Bigg’s killer whales that ventured into Puget Sound. The T34 and T37/37B pods usually travel together and are frequent visitors to the sound, but this time they brought in, and picked up, some interesting “add ons” over the long weekend. Initially they came in with an old adult male that doesn’t visit us very often, T72 (Young), and an extended family member, T37A1 (Inyo), that often travels away from her immediate family. T72 is 48 years old, with a tall dorsal fin and a hook at the top, and he is more common in Southeast Alaska than he is here. T37A1 often travels with different families but this time she decided to hang out with her grandma, T37 (Rocky III), and Aunt T37B (Harald) and their family. To make things even more interesting the T34 pod was missing their youngest member T34A1 (only 3 years old), who has been traveling away from mom, T34A, lately and was seen with the T65B pod in Canada over the weekend. If you’re not confused yet, stick with me because it gets even better. After hunting throughout the northern part of Puget Sound on Saturday and Sunday morning the pod made its way into Port Susan Sunday afternoon, July 3. While we were watching them in Port Susan, T37A1 (Inyo), branched off from the pod briefly and came back with yet another wayward soul, T65A5 (Elsie), and brought him into the mixed pod, bringing it up to 9 orcas. T65A5 also has a habit of traveling away from his family, the T65As, who ironically were visiting the southern part of Puget Sound at the same time. T65A5 sometimes travels by himself and sometimes joins other Bigg’s pods, but he comes back to join his immediate family from time to time too." -Bart Rulon, PSE

T37 (Rocky III), and Aunt T37B (Harald)

Entry 9:
As Bart mentioned, the T65As along with members of the T77s have been visiting the deep south Puget Sound. During their travels around the south sound, it would appear that T77C and T77D branched off from the group on at least one occasion.

Entry 11:
Other groups have showed up further north in the SJIs and Strait of Juan de Fuca, including the T41s, T46s, T49As, T109s, T125A, T128, and T137s. Lots of orcas everywhere in both sunshine and rain, and no one is complaining. What better way to celebrate the weekend before 4th of July than with our black and white friends.*Sun, Jul 3 - Juan de Fuca StraitFrom: Tamara L MayoDate and Time Sighting Observed: 2022-07-03 afternoonMarine Mammal Type: Orca (Killer Whale) Unknown TypeIf SRKW, select pod/s: Pod UnknownGeneral Location: OtherIf other: Port Angeles BayDescribe what you saw: 2 dorsal fins, heard blowing spouts, and swimming around crab potsBWW webform*Sun Jul 3 - Port Angeles Harbor - 13:40 - Left the harbor and went west.

From my observations today, these [orca] whales took the path with the most obstacles. They chose to weave in and out of buoys, crab pots, and countless parked (mostly unoccupied) vessels. They tail slapped 100s of times and breached next to boats. The past hour, no one has followed them, but the majority of the group were constantly surfacing close to obstacles all along the way. Also, it was pretty awesome hearing all the crowds of people cheer in all the homes as the orca passed by. Just happy whales going about their day.19:45 - After taking their SWEET time, they [orca] finally passed Tilicum beach slowly southbound and happy active whales still.17:15 - [orca] Just south of the Camano Country Club trending south.
