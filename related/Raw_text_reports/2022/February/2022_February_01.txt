Yesterday [2/1] in
Similk Bay
, we saw a whale roll and blow and go back down. It was very large and traveling in a southerly direction toward open waters and Saratoga Passage. We watched for it to come back up but it did not show again in our view. We spent many years on Maui and this was definitely a whale. We have lived here 18 years and only one other time early on was there a report or one here and it was sick from what we heard. Follow-up: It had no dorsal fin just appeared as a smooth back as far as what we could see that came above surface. It was not on its side. It was very dark gray, though wet so looked nearly black and very large. All I have is a picture of the water after it went down... I took the photo at
