Decided to take an evening look and both grays pretty much same area as earlier (
14:00). So, assuming they have been milling back and forth. Tried for a 2-blow photo, difficult. But they are together, not too far apart.

Moving a little faster now. A mile or so
north of Mabana Shores, southbound
.

14:15 - Trending slowly southwest
. Still north of Camp Diana area.

I'm viewing from Baby Island Heights,
2 grays milling about a mile or so from Camp Diana
and a few miles south of Elger Bay. Out about 1/4 channel from Camano side. -Marilyn Armbruster

I spotted a
gray whale
today around noon in
Elger Bay off of Camano Island
. He was traveling west toward Whidbey Island and the Saratoga Passage. This is very unusual for this time, as the earliest I've ever seen a Gray was March. -Ed Baran
