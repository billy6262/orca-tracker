11:00-

11:15 -
I've been watching
a gray
far out in the channel, and it is waffling about which direction to go. It's taking several puffs and then going under for a long time. Will keep watching. Very impressive puffs! (As of
11:15 it is heading south/west, but it changes its mind every time I write.)

07:15-

07:45 - Gray whale
northbound passing Mariners Cove 2-12-22

7:15-
7:45am...Another gorgeous morning complete with a gray feeding outside my window at sunrise! Gray worked its way northbound almost to the marina entrance and then headed out toward the channel for a minute or two, changed its mind and came back for round two, chowed down for a few minutes, back out into the channel again for a few minutes, turned around again and came back for round three. At that point it was moving out of sight from my viewing angle. -Marianne Parry

Janine Harles called: Still feeding between Hat Island and Tulalip area, circling around, feeding. 2nd whale: while with Earhart, they spotted blows of who would be a 2nd whale between Hat Island and Mukilteo. They think this whale is possibly heading in northeast direction.

----Great day on the water with a gray whale who I thought was Earhart, then thought it was Little Patch but now I'm thinking Earhart again. We had a second gray nearby, could see its blows but every time we went looking for it, we lost sight of it. -Janine Harles
