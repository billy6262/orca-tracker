Orca Sightings for February 9, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T36s, T36Bs, T99s, T137s) -

13:01-

14:53 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #11: "The whales were well spread, and
T137A
surfaced nearby to give away the ecotype as Bigg's. The animals were clearly hunting a harbour seal, and it seemed possible that there were two simultaneous predations taking place. This suspicion was confirmed after watching the animals for a few minutes while collecting acoustic recordings from the periphery. ..." "T137s and T036 were slightly north and inshore of the T099s and the T036Bs." [See CWR Encounter #11 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-11

Entry 2:
Strait of Georgia (T65A5, T87) -
We just received photos of a special encounter that occurred yesterday off
Bowser, BC
(north of Qualicum Beach). Louis Jobidon sent along these images of the 6
0+ year old T87 Harbeson with 8-year-old T65A5 Elsie
. this report gave us all the feels because T65A5 has been wandering away from his family (and occasionally reuniting with them) since at least the end of 2019 when he was just five years old. Meanwhile, T87 is one of if not the oldest male orca that visits the Salish Sea. Forgive us a moment of anthropomorphism if we say it's heart-warming to see the old legend taking the young tyke "under his fin". The duo was apparently hunting a sea lion! There is so much we don't know about Bigg's killer whale society, including what motivates dispersal from natal family groups and the social associations that follow. Sightings like this one are another piece of the puzzle that give us another glimpse into their complex social world. -Orca Behavior Institute

On the ferry to Anacortes and just passed a large group,
maybe 20, dolphins or porpoises heading west in Upright Channel
across from Indian Cove. They were moving fast and breaking the surface frequently. Not the behavior of harbor porpoises that I'm used to. -Dan Shelley
