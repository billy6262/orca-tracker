Here are the photos I took today from my home on the
south end of Camano Island (Camano Head)
. I look east over Port Susan to Tulalip Bay and Mt. Pilchuck. I'd be happy to send you any photos I take. I can usually get pretty good pics of the whales that come through here. -Leslie Whaley

OR Coast -

17:16-

On Feb 24 Brenda posted on the Oregon Coast Whale Watchers Facebook page, photos of
orcas northbound off of Brookings
that afternoon, which a friend in Crescent City noticed, emailed me, I did the message routine, Brenda emailed me the photos, then full resolution images, here they are cropped and level adjusted for contrast. It looks like three males who put the terror into the gang of sea lions near the buoy out front, what else do you see, especially in that last photo, a breach? From EXIF data the first photo was taken at
5:16 pm, the last at
5:26. photos - https://www.facebook.com/OregonCoastWhaleWatchers/posts/4966838786731559 -Brenda Ziviello-Howell via Jeff Jacobsen
