15:03 - Gray whale
sighting,
2:50 to current time, heading north in Port Susan just south of
Kayak Point
and mid-channel. Update: Two, possibly three. One adult and at least one smaller. The bigger one has white under its tail, but it's too hard to see any distinguishing features for ID'ing. [
From back-of camera photo shared by Linda and taken by "Wendy": "This is
#22 Earhart
!! -Jill Hein
]
Update: I wanted to clarify that there were
two grays
initially spotted south of McKees Beach. The first was a much smaller whale, with a dark tail, with shorter and more frequent surface time. The second was the larger gray with the white tail, later identified as
#22 Earhart
. In the time it took me to get from McKees to Kayak Point, there was only the one large whale, Earhart. There was no sign of the smaller gray. -Linda Raines Tyner

Sun, Jan 23 - ID Update - Based on photos sent to Cascadia Research Collective (CRC) of a gray whale encountered off of Anacortes on
February 26th, Alie Perez, CRC, was able to match the whale to one of two grays encountered on
January 23rd in Burrow Bay who was included in our
January 28th Whale Sighting Report. Alie assigned that whale the ID of
CRC2441
