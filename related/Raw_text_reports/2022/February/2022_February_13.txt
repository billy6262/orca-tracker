Orca Sightings for February 13, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
N Saratoga Passage -

11:10 -
I believe the same
gray whale now moving west towards Maple Grove
boat launch area - close to Camano side (blinding sun glare for me).

10:30 - [gray] Off Mariners' Cove
- continued activity closer to Camano, slowly heading east - breaching gently. -Paul E. Belanger

10:10 -
The fog that rolled in earlier has lifted, and I'm seeing a gray spouting out the channel (closer to Whidbey)
between Mariners' Cove and just south of Utsalady
. I think it's "Mr. Too-Embarrassed-to-Ask-for-Directions" because it seems to be changing direction every couple of puffs.

07:15-

07:45 -
Another stunning sunrise complete with gray whales joining me for coffee. One gray has been slowly cruising by
Mariners Cove
feeding loudly and vigorously (northbound) from around

7:15-
7:45. Still here and doing the "I'm leaving now, no I'm not" behavior that we saw yesterday. The second one is way out in the channel but heading this way.
----My guess is that this was the same whale as the past two mornings, but that's based on behavior not positive ID. This gray friend is a super vigorous feeder - it really churns and splashes a lot, compared to some other grays that we've seen that are typically more leisurely. The reluctance to leave the buffet and going back for more was another repeat from yesterday. Also, the head-bob action was repeated - it lifted its head fully out of the water a couple of times. Maybe it just likes sunrises... Is this considered a spy-hop? The pictures I've seen of whale spyhopping are always more vertical, but this was more almost-horizontal. We've seen this very rarely from other whales over the past few years, and I get really excited when they do it - so cool. -Marianne Parry

Entry 2:
Deception Pass - (~
12:22)

12:42 -
Baleen whale of some kind by Deception Pass about 20min ago, lots of people trying to get second visual but it never resurfaced-was
heading under the bridge toward the bay
/Strawberry Island side. -Bonnie Leavitt

Entry 3:
pairs of porpoises in Tramp Harbor
around noon today. My daughter was like "porpoises aren't interesting, only Orcas." My son and I thought they were pretty interesting when one grabbed a fish in its mouth though. -Scott Hill

Entry 4:
porpoise activity again out at Sunnyside Beach, Steilacoom
. Even more activity and more porpoise than last time! -Cherie St.Ours
