Center for Whale Research Encounter #12: "The animals were travelling steadily east, but moving slowly over the ground against the start of the ebb current, and in a tight group of
20-25 individuals
spread laterally. They were quickly identified as members of
J pod
when Mark picked
J26's
notably wavy fin out of the crowd. The whales dove as Mike 1 neared, but over the next few breath sequences they were able to confirm each member of the pod ..." [See CWR Encounter #12 for full summary, photos, and a video] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-12

Entry 3:
N Saratoga Passage -

11:45 - One gray was feeding actively here just in the south end of Mariners Cove
, and while trying to get photos, I saw puffs in the distance so there are two of them. Both are now headed toward the community in Camano near that point south of Utsalady. This never gets old - just amazing to watch up close.

07:45 -
There was one gray feeding at the "Happy Meal Mudflats" just
south of Mariners Cove
[Oak Harbor area, Whidbey] at
7:45am, heading north along the shore. By the time I dashed out on my deck to take photos, it made a right turn and headed straight out into the channel (so no pix), and appears to be heading toward Utsalady, but zig-zagging a little bit. Enjoy this glorious day - it's beautiful out there this morning! Go Grays!
---- Looks like it has three nubbins going down its forehead. One of the photos is kinda cool because I discovered that there is a second spout way in the background, but right in the middle of the closer whale puff - an unexpected surprise. -Marianne Parry
