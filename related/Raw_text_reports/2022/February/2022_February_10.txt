February 10, 2022: Not one but two gray whales heralded our first Sounder sighting of the year - and there may have been three. After watching the back of a gray whale rising mid-channel
between Mariner's Cove, Whidbey, and Utsalady, Camano Island
, with flat calm seas and good visibility we waited patiently for a second sighting. The next was some 10 minutes later when we spotted a heart-shaped blow close to the bluff east of Polnell Point, Whidbey, a fair distance from the original sighting. Another blow confirmed there were two gray whales feeding close to shore. There was no 'fluking' due to the shallowness, although a sudden lunge by one of the whales seemed to be the precursor for a change in direction toward deeper water (all photos zoomed and cropped).

09:00 - Gray
(assuming) south of
Utsalady
,
9:00am 2/10/22 - southbound northern Saratoga. I'm excited to report my first sighting of the year! (I'm assuming it's a gray, but it's too far away to see for sure.) Looks like a single gray mid-channel between Mariners' Cove (Whidbey) and southern end of Utsalady on Camano. It's not spouting often, and I lost it for several minutes, but now it has popped up again close to the neighborhood right on the beach (can't remember what it's called), so it's not covering a lot of distance. -Marianne Parry

Entry 2:
E Strait of Juan de Fuca/NW Whidbey - ~

16:45 -
I saw a single whale off the beach at
Joseph Whidbey State Park
. It was appropriately
4:45. It was heading towards Port Townsend. We did not see a dorsal fin and suspect it was a
single gray whale
