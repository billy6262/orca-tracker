Orca Sightings for February 18, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saratoga Passage (T46s) -

17:28 - Four orcas southbound just north of Langley
, Whidbey side. We were on the water when we spotted them just before sunset. They were in hunting mode and had a snack judging from the flurry of bird action overhead, before picking up the pace into travel mode and heading south. It's two years since we last saw gray whales and orcas on the same trip, so it was an unexpected bonus to spot a large dorsal fin, followed by three more, as we approached
Fox Spit, Saratoga Passage
, after leaving
Sounder #53
(see earlier post). The hunting party was the
T46s, led by the legendary T46 (Wake)
, who survived the last infamous (but then, weren't they all?) Budd Inlet capture in 1976. The orcas were focused on finishing off a meal, as evidenced by hovering gulls, under a stunning sunset of multiple hues of red and gold, all-in-all a breathtaking spectacle in every respect. As tends to be the way, there was a sudden change of tack and the whales regrouped, moving into fast travel mode as they headed south toward Langley in the waning light (photos zoomed and cropped Richard Snowberger/Sandra Pollard) photo -

Jeanne Hamilton, Langley Whale Center/Orca Network, received report from Tabitha Jacobs-Mangiafico, SWS, initially reporting
3 orcas in Saratoga Passage
hanging around off Bells Beach, Whidbey. She then reported they were a pod of 5 who then moved on southbound toward Langley. -Tabitha Jacobs-Mangiafico

Entry 3:
11:10 -
I just saw
two orcas
. 46 13.78N and 124 18.54W [west of the mouth of the Columbia] at
11:10 am today, Feb. 18, 2022. If I had to guess, it was a male and a female. Although one looked particularly small to me. But sometimes it's hard to size perspective. -Paul Kujala

Entry 4:
N Saratoga Passage -

16:10 -
Smelled whale breath then saw
a gray whale
ahead of us closer to
Mariner's Cove
traveling into shallower water toward Skagit Bay. Ten minutes later spotted a blow behind us - pretty sure this was #53 Little Patch traveling closer to Utsalady Bay, also heading toward Skagit Bay. Perhaps
Sounder #53 Little Patch
should be renamed The Scarlet Pimpernel ("They seek him here, they seek him there"). After inhaling the inimitable aroma of whale breath on the still air, we saw his dorsal knuckles rising ahead of us in what seems to be
currently a favored triangular feeding area between Mariner's Cove, Whidbey, and Utsalady Bay, Camano
. After watching him dive and disappear we expected that would be the last we saw of him knowing we were running out of time, so didn't expect to see him surface 10 minutes later some way behind us as we idled in the glassy waters. His distinctive patch quashed any doubts as to whether this was a second whale. After making another dive he reappeared closer to the shoreline of Utsalady Bay, once again heading toward Skagit Bay, before we turned for home and - unbeknown to us - a stunning sunset and a big surprise!

14:35 -
I see
a gray
out here prob mid-channel just past the
northern tip of Camano
. At the moment, heading into Skagit Bay, but they seem to turn around as soon as I report.

13:15 -
I think they are staying closer to Camano and
heading south/west down the Camano coast
, approaching the point just
south of Maple Grove
community.

12:40 -
I just happened to see a puff waaaaay over by Camano, and after watching for a few minutes, there are definitely two grays. It looks like they are heading toward Whidbey/Mariners Cove/Polnell, but they are still way out in the channel.

A neighbor texted me about
a gray at the Happy Meal Mudflats
around
10:45 this morning. I barely caught a glimpse of it before it went around the bend toward
Polnell
