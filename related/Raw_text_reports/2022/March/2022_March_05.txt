"Your photo of the fluke top is
22 Earhart
. With your fluke of
531
, Sara's photo of
723
right side, and your right-side share on Orca Network of the unknown whale, you two were tracking 4 whales on
March 5th, not 2 as thought. This is a great reminder of the importance of photo-documentation!" -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
