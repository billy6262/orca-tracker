17:35 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #13: "The distant group turned out to be exactly who was being looked for as it was J40 traveling with the
J37s
and they were maybe a
half mile east of Kelp Reef. J37s new calf was sighted immediately
although it took several surfacings to properly photograph the quick little whale. The calf appears to be pretty young as it is still a little lumpy. The dorsal fin was upright which means the calf is over a day old but, due to its "lizard head" look, it is probably younger than a couple of weeks. Usually, new calves start filling out behind their blowhole after their third week. The calf appears to have a closed saddle on its left side with a hint of a black spine and a tiny finger."

Entry 2:
Grey Whale CRC 2440, aka The Haro Strait Grey,
in Haro Strait, off of Ten Mile Point in the
Cadboro Bay area of Saanich
, on southern Vancouver Island this morning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shkFqK51_VM -Gerald Graham
*

Entry 3:
N Saratoga Passage -

15:30 -
We were treated to
two grays
feeding outside
Mariners Cove
a few minutes ago! It looked like they were feeding near the marina entrance (it sounds like they came from the south but I missed them when they went by the first time), and then one went out into the channel and the other kept feeding but moving back down south toward the Happy Meal Mudflats. The one that went out in the channel is looping back in toward Whidbey but was still pretty far out the last time I saw it. The one feeding at the mudflats moved along fairly quickly and I'm guessing they will meet up again at Polnell (but who knows - lol). -Marianne Parry

Entry 4:
Possession Sound -
Judy and Tom Nowak called again to report seeing whale(s) in
Possession Sound between Hat Island and Tulalip
area 4 of the past 6 days. Still think best description is sperm whale (see Friday Feb 25 report), still convinced not grays even though we've shared that those are the only whales being confirmed in that area.
