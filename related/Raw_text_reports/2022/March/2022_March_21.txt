----"thanks to Jackie Hildering, aka The Marine Detective, and Ashley Hoyland & Mark Sawyer of The Whale Centre. Ashley advises,
today’s Grey Whale was seen almost exactly a year ago
(Mar 16th, 2021) over in Tofino. It spent a bit of time in very shallow water close to town over a sandbar known to local First Nations as 'The place where whales stand on their tails'. This whale had not been seen locally (in Tofino) before last year (to their knowledge).” -Comox Valley Wildlife Sightings
