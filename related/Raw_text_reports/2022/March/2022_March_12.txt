Orca Sightings for March 12, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gulf Islands, BC - ~

10:30 -
My location:  Stoney Hill, Outside
Maple Bay, BC
(North Cowichan) north entrance of
Sansum Narrows
facing Saltspring Island. (Lat:  48.803377; Lng:  -123.579548). Sighted a pod on Sat, approximately 1030 hrs. The group was traveling slowly south from the vicinity of Vesuvius Bay, toward Sansum Narrows.  They spent 15 - 20 minutes apparently feeding at the north end of the narrows on the Saltspring Island side of the channel. Quite a bit of breaching and tail slapping. Some side and upside down "floating".  I suspect this is the same group (
J pod
) seen on Friday. Unfortunately, I didn't get any shots that have good images of distinctive fins or saddles. -Karen Lund

Volunteer Karen Graham called to report seeing the orcas, including young one, just now leaving Holmes Harbor. They were right out from the

1:10 - Orcas in Holmes Harbor
, mid harbor, just north of Holmes Harbor Golf Course dock. -Cindi Bowen
*

10:45 -
Spotted at
10:45 am in the
south end of Holmes Harbor
very near the park. Counted 6 whales, including one large male, and it appeared there were 2 calves. Orcas moved very slowly, lots of milling about, spy hopping and tail slapping. Appeared to be feeding as gulls and an eagle were interested when the whales surfaced. Watched them for 40 minutes. Headed north towards
Honeymoon Bay
where two whale watching vessels arrived to view. Hopefully they can provide more details and photos. -Catherine Drews
*

11:30 - The orcas
have just cruised past the bottom of our road, north of the
Holmes Harbor golf course
, heading steadily outbound. At least a dozen seals were grouped up in shallow water close to Freeland beach. Safety in numbers!

11:15 -
They are angling
slowly north in Holmes Harbor
. Had a meal judging by the waiting birds. Lots of spy-hops.
10.45 -
They have slowed down, east side of harbor, and appear to be hunting.

10:40 - [T99s]
They are in
Holmes Harbor
proper heading toward Freeland dock at speed, mid channel.
----Wow - whales deep in
Holmes Harbor
today with the
T99s
cruising right past the bottom of our road. With the first report of them near Baby Island before doing a disappearing act, we whizzed down to
Freeland Park
and soon spotted them heading at speed toward the boat ramp - they hadn't wasted any time. They slowed down and changed gear to hunting mode, circling and milling with frequent spy-hops as they angled more toward the east side of Holmes Harbor. Judging by the flurry of gulls overhead they probably had some success before re-grouping and heading back north from whence they came. Cool!

Yesterday was another great day on the water, with T99s and
three gray whales
seen on the Island Explorer 5 (
Little Patch by Strawberry Point
, and two others seen briefly and unidentified). The photos are from very far away, and don't show much of the dorsal ridge. The T99s passed right by this individual and it was as if it knew they were close because it stayed as shallow as possible and was incredibly subtle with any surfacing or movement until they passed. (All of the photos are of the same whale.) -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching
[Whale in two of the photos is
22 Earhart
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network]
