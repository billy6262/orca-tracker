March 20:
After nine days of the T99s thrilling whale watchers with their presence around Whidbey's shores
, the local seals can now venture back into the water... Accompanied by the T46B pod, T137s, T125 and T127 ('Hacksaw' est. to be about 38 years of age not seen in the region since 2015) making a total of 17 whales - thanks Orca Network and Bart Rulon for confirming IDs - the
T99s blew north in Admiralty Inlet
with panache, slowing down the ferry and attracting a unique escort as they passed Fort Casey, teeming with visitors who could hardly believe their luck. What an adventure! -Sandra Pollard

T99E
get active with several spyhops in the waves. These are the days I dream about and I'm so grateful to the network of people that make them happen! -Dori Dace

----With the whales more on the west side of

T137A
made my heart so full.
