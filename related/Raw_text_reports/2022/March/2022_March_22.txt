[We sent Gerald’s video to Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective: “Yes, I was able to match that to the photos I have of the individual seen on the 15th and 17th from Val Shore and Karac Lindsey of Eagle Wing Tours (they saw yesterday again as well). I finished comparing to the catalog and found that it matched
CRC766
