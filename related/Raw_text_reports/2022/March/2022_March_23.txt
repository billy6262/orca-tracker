============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T65As, T77 & T77E, T99s) -
It was really nice to see these families together this evening. If whales ever get the zoomies I think
T099E
had them.
T065A5 was back
with the family and as we headed home, we found
T065A3
way across the [Haro] strait, parallel to the rest of the whales, just a few miles away. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Naturalist/Captain, Maya’s Legacy Whale Watching

Entry 6:
Port Susan -

08:11 - Port Susan Whale Watchers are tracking
2 Grays
heading north toward Kayak Point at

Entry 7:
S Saratoga Passage -
Definitely a whale with a dorsal about 2/3s down the back but only 8-12 feet long. VERY cryptic but we got a few good looks. We’re assuming
Minke
since that’s most likely but open to other possibilities. I got some photos I’ll share later, just wanted to update with a description of the animal. We last saw it pointed north. -Justine Buckmaster, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

11:56 -
The whale watching boat Saratoga spotted a
possible small Minke whale between Langley and Camano head
northbound.
