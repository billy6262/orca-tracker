They began the encounter at 0832 with the easily identifiable T037, and her daughter T037B. The animals were traveling very slowly, with six- to eight-minute dives. After collecting left-side ID photos of the duo, the Mike 1 crew manoeuvred inshore to find T034 and her youngest, T034B. Still missing two animals from the group, T034A and  T037B1, Mark and Joe lingered on the periphery of the found group and  scanned southwest, toward shore and a few active bait balls. It took several minutes before Mark was finally able to detect the missing pair, with a third, well inside the entrance to Pedder Bay.…” -See full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter 59*Mon, Sep 19 - San Juans (T60D & T60E) - 16:00 - The two brothers sighted off Pender Island. -Kerry Brandon [WSSJI]*Mon, Sep 19 - BC - I assume you  like to keep track of the calves so thought I should send this to you.

While star-gazing in  the moonless hours of a very calm evening, my husband and I heard approaching whale breaths. Due to the number of breaths, close in time to one another, and also spread out in distance (to both sides of our position, near and far), we assume it was a pod of orcas. But we never  could glimpse a dorsal fin in the darkness. We also heard a few splashes. The breaths approached and retreated over the course of about  45 minutes (9:00 to 9:45pm).Photos available?: No*14:42 - They’re [SRKW] probably Race Rocks-ish by now.

Between Race Rocks and Jordan River (like i  said west) we saw at least a hundred humpbacks including several mom  and calf pairs. It was unbelievable to just sit in the middle of the  Strait and see blows 360 degrees around you at varying distances as far  as the eye could see. It was all we could do to tear ourselves away from  the spectacle and if some of us had our way we'd still be there. -Debbie Stewart*Sun, Sep 18 - North Puget Sound (Two Spot) - 13:25 - One humpback southbound mid channel between Shilshole and Point Wells.

These two brothers, aged 14 and 18 respectively, have only loosely associated with the other members of their family since the summer of 2019…” -See full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter 58 *Excerpt from Encounter #57: -“Mark positioned the boat parallel to the most westerly group of whales, which were soon identified as T060, T060F  & T060G. More whales were spread out behind them, so after a quick look at these three individuals, Mark and Brendon opted to start working through the remaining extensive group, which they could see socializing a few hundred meters behind. This group was angled west-northwest and after determining that lighting was most optimal for lefts, the team moved  over to the port side of the whales. Quickly, Brendon was able to identify the group as the T069s, T109As and three members of the T059s:  T059, T059A2 & T059A4. These three have been associating with  members of the T060s and T109Bs in recent weeks, so it was interesting  to see them traveling rather tightly with the T109As…” -See full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter 57 *Reports of 10+ Bigg's/Transient Killer Whales  T109As, T060s and T059 heading west off Port Angeles took us to a fun  excited group. -Sooke Coastal Explorations -photos by Paul Pudwell, September 17, 2022*Sat, Sep 17 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - 12:50 - Farther W of Port Angeles, like 4 or 5 miles and still westbound.  -Lorna VanderZanden is having a good whale week! *09:53 - Lorna reports again seeing orcas, five this morning, off West Bluff Dr, Port Angeles heading westbound towards  Ediz Hook. *Sat, Sep 17 - West Whidbey (T007Bs and T100Bs) - 18:20 - Seemingly disappeared northwest. - 18:05 - Fins visible with binos, backlit blows visible without.

They are  watching who they believe are two humpback whales milling about mid  channel Saratoga Passage north of Hidden Beach (1/2 way between Hidden  Beach and Houston Road). They have been watching them for about 10  minutes, not really advancing in any direction; the whales have just  been gently surfacing, milling about, maybe slow trend northbound.  Described small dorsal, don't look to have barnacles of gray, one seems larger than the other. They are also enjoying the harbor seal swimming  around and mom and baby raccoons feeding on shellfish in the tideline. September 8SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) - Thu, Sep 8 - Haro Strait (J & K Pod) - Excerpt from Encounter #55: “We eventually made it on scene near the south end of False Bay at 0900. There were two large resting lines with all of J  pod being slightly inside all of K pod. All the whales were heading  slowly south. About twenty minutes later, after a little milling, all the whales turned around and headed north again. The K16s, J47, and a  couple others broke off and began socializing a little to the inside of  the main J and K pod groups…” -See full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter 55 *“9-08-22 K-Pod and J-Pod, Haro Strait - 16:35, K-Pod and J-Pod northbound /up-island, one  mile south of Landbank's Westside Preserve.

A three groups of females and young males exploded in a race  down island of extended porpoising. One group was so close together they were obscured by the water that sprayed up around them.

You  see, there are researchers and scientists who track all species of whales. Our pictures help these folks follow the migration and health of  the whales. When I take pictures of a minke I post them in a group specifically for minke in our area. I post the day, time, location and  describe what I observed. There are researchers who record all of this  information and use the pictures to identify the whale. It turns out, this minke was spotted in 2010, 2011, and 2013 here in the SJI. His number is SJI-0031- his name, as dubbed affectionately by those who  follow and research these minke, is indeed Antonio Banderas. -Cindi Crowder Rausch - 16:00 - Our position [approx. 48.516812, -122.672900] viewing Antonio Banderas. -photos by Cindi Crowder Rausch, September 6, 2022*Tue, Sep 6 - San JuansSent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Tom ReeveDate of Sighting: 9/6/2022Time: 9:10 AMSpecies seen: minkeNumber of animals seen: 1Where seen: East of Aleck Bay, South Lopez 48.418168, -122.857124Direction of travel : eBehaviors observed: traveling rapidlyPhotos available?: NoSeptember 5SOUTHERN RESIDENTS (fish-eating ecotype) - Mon, Sep 5 - Active Pass (J Pod) - 06:44 - J pod just went north in Active Pass, have a nice rest day. -Rachelle Hayden [WSSJI]*BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Mon, Sep 5 - San Juans (T65A5, T100s, T101s, T124Ds, T137s) - Excerpt from Encounter #54: “After the T49As moved off to the north, the team  headed back up the hill to the office only to hear over the radio that another group of transients were inside of Sunset Point. So we ran back  down to the porch to see more whales appearing from behind Sunset Point. This was all six of the T60s (including T60D and T60E) plus T2B and  they went inside the reef in front of CWR and inside of the salvage  barge. It was a nice pass and we got some good photos of the group as they headed north. Not long after we again made our way back up the hill, Dave got a text from John Durban saying that their research team had found a large number of transients north of Patos Island. We then headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at 1250. “Orcinus” arrived on scene about 4-5 miles north of Patos at 1345.

I assumed they were of the  few that were part of the groups. But couldn't tell if SB or NB? Too far over. Just assumed SB. I headed to Shore Meadows and only saw one backlit blow at the very northeast corner of Mutiny Bay. Thinking again they would all show up. Stayed there for a half hour. Nothing. Makes me wonder if at that time they changed directions? And me, my heart and  mind is with the crash victims. About that same area.
