Here is a link to my latest Grey Whale video, which was filmed at 2:05 PM, Wednesday, April 13, 2022, from Cadboro Bay, Saanich. https://youtu.be/0D9oL_gDQhg -Gerald Graham * Wed, Apr 13 - Northern Saratoga Passage - 09:40 - Now heading mid channel, west. 09:21 - Two gray whales are heading towards Camano. 9:21am, 4/13. -Terra Parham * ~08:00 - I looked up and saw this gray approaching the beach [near Mariners Cove, Whidbey] from out in the channel and then it cruised along southward toward the Happy Meal Mudflats and onward toward Polnell. I text’d Greg and Terra, and they picked up the sighting down at Polnell, although they saw two of them, so not sure if it was the same grays. This one looks different from any gray I can recall seeing – it has a huge extra bump right behind the blowholes, and if you zoom in, it really looks strange and almost disturbing.  I hope it’s not from injury or something.  Very distinctive though. -Marianne Parry * Wed, Apr 13 - Saratoga Passage - 18:20 - Rachel pointed out gray whale, too, which is north of Summerland and south of Mabana Shores. -via Marilyn Armbruster * ~17:00-17:30 - Around 5-5:30 pm we saw several blows and 2 tails around Race Lagoon headed N/NE. -Erin Keyes * 14:50 - Both grays passed Camano State Park NB Whidbey side of mid channel. -Marilyn Armbruster * 13:00 - The 2 grays passed in front of Langley northbound about mid channel, followed by whale watching boat. -Jorge L.

Hayden, SSOS * Tue, Apr 12 - South Puget Sound/Case Inlet - ~18:30 - Late in the afternoon yesterday (Tuesday, April 12] there was a huge group of seals swimming north through the Treasure Island channel.

According to PWWA naturalists on scene, Valiant was rolling around and trumpeting with each surfacing, a behavior associated with aggression in humpback whales.  This was not Valiant’s first run-in with orcas. In 2019, Valiant, at the young age of 2, was seen following closely behind a pair of orcas in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Last year, Valiant was harassed by a group of orcas but “aggressively chased them away”. The extreme scarring on Valiant’s tail indicates that this whale survived a brutal orca attack at just a few months old. Did that initial encounter shape the way Valiant interacts with orcas today? The message is pretty clear… don’t mess with Valiant! follow-up: …pretty much directly in the Tsawwassen ferry lane. Our operators contacted BC Ferries on the radio and they were great about slowing down and changing course to avoid both the orcas and the humpback whale! -Erin Johns Gless, Executive Director, Pacific Whale Watch Association * GRAY WHALES - Tue, Apr 12 - N Skagit Bay - 11:19 - Grey whale between Hope Island and Ala Spit.

Baron * 13:40 - One gray between mid Baby Island Heights and Camano State Park, mid channel, northbound. Another gray traveling southbound 1/2 mile from southend Bells Beach, Whidbey side of mid channel. -Marilyn Armbruster  April 11 BIGG’S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Mon, Apr 11 - San Juan Islands (T65As, T123s) - Center for Whale Research Encounter #17: The whales, previously identified as the T65As and the T123s, were still milling and feeding north of O’Neal Island near Reuben Tarte County Park, where they had been found over an hour earlier. There was a large blubber oil slick with lots of gulls flying overhead and swooping down to pick up scraps or dip the oil. …” [See CWR Encounter #17 for full Encounter Summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-17  * Mon, Apr 11 - San Juan Islands (T65As, T123s) - 16:56 - [orcas] They’re headed for Cattle Pass.

IDs by Sara Hysong-Shimazu. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network * Thanks to the keen eyes of our passengers, Captain Alan got his wish. The T65As and the T123s were working on a Steller sea lion right off O'Neal Island. We got to watch them strategize, feed, and then strategize some more as they pinned a sea lion for forty minutes until it made a run for it - and then big boy T123A Stanley flew after him in pursuit. -Ellie Sawyer, Naturalist, Maya’s Legacy Whale Watching * 17:25 - Exiting Cattle aiming for Iceberg, moving fast on the ebb. 17:15 - Visible from Cattle Point. 15:40 - Now heading south down San Juan Channel towards Friday Harbor. 14:20 - Drifting closer to Mineral Point now. 14:00 - Drifting a little further south now but mostly milling and enjoying the remnants of a sea lion. 13:35 - T65As and T123s milling off Reuben Tarte. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute * GRAY WHALES - Mon, Apr 11 (since 4/8) - S Rosario Strait/Burrows Bay - CRC2440 has been in the vicinity of Alexander Beach from at least 4/8-4/11 — didn’t look for them today, so could be there today as well.
