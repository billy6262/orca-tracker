When the whales regrouped after their surfing safari, J37 and J59 had showed up again with J40 close beside them. J46 and J49 joined the threesome while J42 and J53 wandered off although J42 soon came back and joined the group again. ” [See CWR Encounter #16 for full Encounter Summary and more photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-16  * Sun, Apr 10 - San Juan Channel to Haro Strait (Js) - 16:10 - Last position update from me, passing Little D'Arcy Island, direction NNE.

I'd guess direction NNE. 15:30 - Tracking a group W of D'Arcy Island, moving north. 15:25 - [SRKW] Faint EL clicks on the LK Hydrophone.

One of his companions was an older calf and the other a female. I couldn't make out her saddle patch. 12:45 - The breaching group had stopped breaching, direction more northerly with SR3, 2 miles from shore across from Landbank approaching Lime Kiln (judging from my location south of Landbank). 12:18 - While watching breaching group, calls heard on LK hydrophone. 11:50 - 12:35 Far to the south, 4-6 orcas milling 1-1/2 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve, 1/4 mile out from shore. Within minutes the group began to move to the W/NW away from shore. The group breached over and over, sometimes one after another in a line. Huge breaches at times with flukes above water. These bursts of activity alternated with long group dives and when surfacing they would be farther from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI * 11:26 - [Js] Stalled near False Bay / Kanaka Bay. -Chris Wilson * 10:40 - Eight orcas just passed Eagle Pt. (west side of SJI).

They stopped to wait for the next dive cycle as the whales approached them. The following dive sequence put the whales a few metres abeam of them. Mark immediately recognized the bull T049C and a group of recently regularly sighted animals in the area, the T030B's, T117B, and T172. …” [See CWR Encounter #15 for full Encounter Summary and photos] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2022-15  * UNIDENTIFIED ORCAS - Sun, Apr 10 - San Juan Islands - 18:40 - Orcas heading south, President Channel.

[video] -Gerald Graham - video - https://youtu.be/DOzg4aKlsDY  * Sun, Apr 10 - Central Puget Sound - ~16:00 - I was out kayaking on Sunday afternoon about 4pm in Liberty Bay. And there was a gray whale surfacing every 5-10 minutes. We watched it surface by the marina first, and then it moved its way to the end of the bay. We were surprised how close to the dock it surfaced. Probably 50 feet from the dock. It then moved its way back to out of the bay and toward the inlet north of Lemolo. It surfaced 3-4 times in the same spot VERY close to shore. But it was far away from us, so I can’t say how far in feet. It then moved out and surfaced probably 20 feet from the naval ship stationed at Keyport. It was surprising to see how close it surfaced from the ship. -Christopher Blesie * Sun, Apr 10 - Holmes Harbor - 18:50 - North of Beverly Beach nearing Saratoga Launch and Baby Island next.

Must be finding a lot to eat. 15:45 - Gray whale in Holmes Harbor milling around mid-harbor near Holmes Harbor Golf course. No real direction.

The surface was choppy and I only caught glimpses of partial saddle patches including J39 Mako (ID Monika Wieland Shields) and wonderful to see J37 Hy'Shqa with 6-7 week old J59. The first group 5-6 members in a loose formation 1/2 mile out. The second group closer in with 2 (3?) calves including J59 with Mom J37 Hy'Shqa. For 10 minutes at 13:45 the tight group formed a resting line. J59 was very bouncy changing sides while swimming with J37, back and forth. After the rest there was active surface behavior, tail lobs and side floating with displayed pectoral fins. To my absolute delight J59 flipped a perfect little upside-down tail lob - lil' baby lob. Photos taken from shore, cropped and enlarged. -Michelline Halliday * 13:15 - Orcas just off Hannah Heights (west side of SJI, btw Pile Pt. and Lime Kiln).
