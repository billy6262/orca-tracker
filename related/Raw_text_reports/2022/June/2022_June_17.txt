Entry 3:
We overlook the entrance to the Saanich Inlet on Vancouver Island, just south of the southern tip of Saltspring Island. The photos were taken on
June 17th, from a reasonable distance. They [orca] were swimming south into the inlet. There seemed to be 5 - a twosome of what seemed like mid size, and a threesome just behind. We could only get photos of the threesome. Keep up the good work; we always look forward to your updates. -Marg Woolley
