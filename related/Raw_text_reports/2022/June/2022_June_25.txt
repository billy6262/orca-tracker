12:15 -

12:45 - The L12 sub-group of L-Pod traveled southbound 1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve
. The
7 orcas
were moving quickly and were spread out. The closest to me were
L25 Ocean Sun and L77 Matia
but I couldn't ID the others except for the large male 1/2 mile out which I am assuming was
L85 Mystery
. A pair of humpbacks traveled north at the same time but were closer in to shore then the orcas were.

00:01 - Multiple orcas blows heard
. Orcas traveling northbound 1.2 miles south of Landbank.
J-Pod met w sub-group L12s six hours ago just south of Landbank Westside Preserve
then traveled together down island. This must be them returning from the south. Continuous blows, occasional fluke lobs, milling slowly northbound 1/4+ miles from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
