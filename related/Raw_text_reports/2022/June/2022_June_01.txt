Orca Sightings for June 1, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (J Pod) -
Fantastic day on San Juan Island with Jill Hein...we decided to go the night before, and wow, it was amazing....seeing members of
J pod from San Juan County Park, Lime Kiln and Landbank
!!!! Sort of like the "old days" when they were here much more often! Thanks to Ariel Yseth for help with i.d.'s....still not sure so maybe Ariel Yseth help me out if I got them wrong? So good to see Cindy Hansen who helped us with updates...spotty service around there! What a treat to see little J59, just about 14 weeks old, so active and playful, especially so close to shore at Landbank! And my adoptee, Star!!! -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 2:
*
A last minute decision Tues night had Bonnie Gretz and I on an early ferry to San Juan Island Weds morning in hopes of seeing
J-pod
– WOW – we started at
County Park and ended at Land Bank
– with several visits to those viewing places - and Lime Kiln – throughout the day. We saw many members of J-pod with CLOSE pass-by’s at Lime Kiln and Landbank. WOW again! We mostly saw members of the
J14s and J17s
, but am so rusty with IDs – thankfully Ariel Yseth was with us to keep us abreast. The biggest thrill was seeing
J59, the newest calf (mom is J37 Hy ‘Shqa
) born about 3 months ago – good news being a girl – she brings some hope to the survival of our Endangered Southern Resident whales. It was almost like ‘old times’ – so so good to see J-pod! -Jill Hein
