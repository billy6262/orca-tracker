We’ve had a real treat watching
Gray 2440
make the rounds to all its favorite snacking spots up here this afternoon. I first heard that there was a
gray feeding down by Polnell
around 3pm-ish, and it veerrrry slowly made its way up here to
Mariners’ Cove
, arriving into view at
4:45pm (that’s super slow progress compared to normal). It chowed down at the Happy Meal mudflats for a good half hour, splashing and waving, and then gradually continued snacking up the beach past Mariners’ Cove (northbound). I confirmed that it was 2440 with the double-hump and white patch. I thought it had moved on to the north, but then around 6pm I spotted puffs midchannel southbound and it appeared to be heading back toward Polnell. Friends at Polnell saw it coming but said it changed direction and was heading back up the beach toward Mariner’s Cove once again. It was zooming along this time and I saw it just a few minutes later, around
7:40pm. I confirmed that it was still 2440, and it cruised quickly up the beach and off to the north. -Marianne Parry
