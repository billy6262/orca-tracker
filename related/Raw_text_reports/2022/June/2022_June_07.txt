Humpback (think it was Kata) at
Point Defiance
6/7/22. Won’t lie, just a little heartbroken that I missed Kata’s spectacular show, I hear up to 50 breaches at one point, yesterday- by less than 40mins!! If only…Still so happy I got to see her a couple of times between Dunes Peninsula and Owens Beach viewing points and got these pictures. Lesson of the day- don’t leave Cherie StOurs when she’s on a roll whale spotting- she really was dialed in on Kata’s movements yesterday and I’m delighted she and several others got to see the Kata show yesterday afternoon! Hopefully will be my turn soon! -Jennifer Swenson
