12:09 -
Matthew Pfab called to report a baleen whale off
Chambers Bay
, milling about 100 yards offshore while trending southbound toward Chambers Bay Creek bridge &
Steilacoom
. Whale has dorsal fin and been seeing the fluke (which would most probably mean
humpback
).
“All the photos are taken from the bridge to the beach in Chambers Bay Park. The whale never surfaced so that the underside of the fluke was toward the beach, unfortunately. The fluke photos are looking south
toward Steilacoom and Ketron Island
, and the whale was about 100-150 yards offshore. The photos of the dorsal fin are as the whale was moving north past Chambers Bay Park. It was about 20-30 yards offshore! It was amazing to see the humpback so close!”
