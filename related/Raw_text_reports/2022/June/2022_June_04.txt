Just wanted to drop a note to say that I believe I saw a
humpback whale in Burrow
channel
(off Washington Park in
Anacortes
), on Saturday, 06/04 at approximately
11:15am. The whale was traveling west. I only saw it once but waiting for it to resurface but never saw where it came back up. -Thanks, Betsy Bertiaux

GRAY WHALES -

Entry 6:
N Saratoga Passage -

14:00 - Gray 2440 in upper Saratoga,
northbound: We just spotted gray 2440 (double-hump and white patch) heading north passing by
mariners’ cove
. It’s not close to the beach, but closer to the Whidbey side of the channel than Camano. Last few snacks before heading north, or perhaps it has decided to stay and be our new summer companion. Have a great day! Go grays! -Marianne Parry
