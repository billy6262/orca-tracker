Orca Sightings for June 11, 2022
============================================================

Entry 1:
K Pod off the Oregon coast
! From Orca Behavior Institute: “Well look who we have here! Check out this video of K-Pod heading south off
Coos Bay, Oregon
on
June 11! What
looks to be their new calf
, first seen in a video from the Oregon Coast on
April 22, is visible at the
0:49 and
1:03 marks. Interestingly, the calf does not appear to be with K20, who it surfaced next to in the previous video, so the plot thickens as to who the mother might be! We will anxiously await K-Pod's return to the Salish Sea and an official update from the Center for Whale Research, who for over 45 years have documented the births and deaths of the Southern Resident killer whale population.” -Link to video taken by Floyd Russell: [
