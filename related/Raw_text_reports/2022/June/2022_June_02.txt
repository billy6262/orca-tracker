On
June 2, they [
J pod
]
headed back west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca
, and all we can do is wait to see when they will make their next appearance, with fingers crossed that it will be sometime in June and that it will be because they are following salmon back in to the Salish Sea. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

BIGG'S KILLER WHALES -
Thu, Jun 2 – South Sound (T64B's & T65As) -
Excerpts from Jami Cantrell day report: "…here’s my story from the day! was watching the
T65As and T64Bs travel between Fox and McNeil Islands headed southeast through Carr Inlet
. Once I no longer had my eyes on them I headed to the Fox Island fishing pier to see if they were going to go south or north after exiting Carr.
I always go to the Fishing Pier in hopes that one day I'll catch them under the pier, swimming just beneath my feet. I had been talking to people who were there with me about it before the orcas got there. It's been one of my biggest dreams, ever since I was a wee lassie.
A gentleman and I stood out there waiting in the rain for about 30 minutes before anyone else got there, and then we waited about 45 minutes after that… I have never seen an orca breach that close to me. Furthermore, I have never seen them swim so close to me before. As they went under the pier, I put my camera down and just lived in the moment.
Then, to top off an already incredible experience, they turned back
down Hales Passage and headed towards the Fox Island Bridge
! I have been trying to see them from this bridge since I lived on the island like 6 years ago!...Well, yet again, not only did they just travel under the bridge, they stayed for 15 minutes! We were all pretty much positive they were hunting a seal, right under the bridge! They kept popping up right in front of us and it was obvious they were just as intrigued with us as we were them. I made eye contact with Ooxjah (I spell it wrong every time lol) multiple times as he glided by just beneath the surface…They swam off into the sunset, and I left with my heart full….Happy Orca Month and Pride Month!" -Jami Cantrell

Excerpts from Hillary Butler day report:" I first saw them earlier in the day from by my house. We took the kids out, but a rain pour scared us back home…But knew if close to
Fox Island Bridge
, I would need my phone and not my camera. I learn they were trending up, so I kept on the mission for FI. Make it just as I see Ooxjaa approaching bridge. I was going to make it, after wifey surely didn't think I would make it in time…Just feeding and playing with everyone that was blessed to catch them hang around the bridge for about 5 minutes. Here is an awesome memory I will enjoy forever. It really was the most connected I have felt certainly. It was like they wanted to say hello and hang for a while with me. Thank you Orcas! See you next adventure!" -Hillary Butler -

13:48 to Sunset -
Had a couple of wonderful encounters with our beautiful orcas again today! First saw a group of approx. 4 on the Peninsula side of the
Carr Inlet opposite Kopachuck Park
at approx.
1:48pm...I thought they had headed north but somehow they had turned back, and I saw them again this time around mid-channel heading southbound past
Horsehead Bay
at
3:54pm. Lots of breaching, spyhopping, tail slapping going on, but they were pretty spread out so hard to catch! Delighted I caught the double breach- first time I’ve ever seen that! Then 3rd time was the charm as the sun was setting tonight! First saw a large dorsal fin close to Horsehead Bay heading south before I heard and then saw at least 2 over on the Peninsula side heading northbound. Another separate Orca seemed to be heading south from Kopachuck, mid channel so not sure how many there were total in the end!! Really hope they’re going to stick around for a while... -Jennifer Swenson
