Where seen: Holmes harbor. .75 miles north of Nichols brothers shipyard. About 300 yards off of west
shore. Appeared to be moving North
Direction of travel : N. Leisurely. Only heard one blow and then saw back.
FOLLOW UP: I am not that sure [
minke vs humpback]
. All I saw was the back 1/3 of the dorsal. No tail, flukes etc. Could have been a humpback. Blow was quite loud if that helps. I didn’t see the blow, just heard it.
