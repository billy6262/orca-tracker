Entry 1:
BIGG’/TRANSIENT ORCAS -

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T49As) -
With a tip from a friend out west of orca, we headed out to see if we could find them. We excitedly found Bigg’s /Transient killer whales (T049a's) sharing a kill! -Sooke Coastal Explorations

Entry 3:
Active Pass (T125A, T128, T137s) -
In the afternoon, T125A with his distinctive notch in his fin, T128, and the T137s (thanks to R. Hayden for ID) went quickly with the tide eastward through
Active Pass
. They were gone in a flash. Photos taken from the shore of Galiano Island, BC. -Karoline Cullen

19:39 - [humpback]
A giant cartwheel. What's in the foreground is the tip of
Cooper Point
. In the background is Gull Harbor. Highly cropped. I'm on the shore of Eld Inlet. Could feel the concussions. And then, of course, the delayed booms.

15:00 -
I watched it [
humpback
] do a lunge feed out of the corner of my eye as it was exiting
Budd Inlet
. It then traveled northeast toward the shoreline between the lighthouse and Burfoot Park. I watched it breach very close to that opposite shore at least 4 times. Last sighting from my viewpoint was its single slow rolling surface heading south west and back into Budd Inlet. So it essentially did a super large circle before it was out of sight. -Kim Merriman
