Orca Sightings for April 5, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
An
orca
was sighted around
2 pm
, when I was walking First Beach, which is the beach belonging to the Quileute Tribe, in La Push, WA. It is only about a mile long. The orca was cruising back and forth, N-S. Never breached, so I only saw the dorsal fin. There were a lot of gray whales around. This is in about 15 feet of water, very close to shore. Also attached is one picture of gray whale from same walk. (photos were sent - looked like a Transient orca following the grays...sb)

Around

5:15 pm
, spotted two
grays
(spouting, diving, and flukes breaking water) between Camano Island Maple Bay & Polnell Point. They slowly moved towards Crescent Bay, and then off towards Oak Harbor.

We live on the West side of Camano Is., on the beach, 3/4 mile north of Cama Beach. I observed whale spouts rounding Cama Head, heading our way at about

5:05PM
. They were
Grey
whales. They passed our place on Manaco Beach about
5:20 and went out of sight to the north fifteen minutes later. For what it is worth, we have seen whales here every day for the last twelve days.

Southern Residents were making their way up the coast offshore; We found about a dozen members of
L pod
just a few miles north of Westport at

8:30
AM. ID photos have been sent out for confirmation of who all was there. We were on one of our 120nm surveys of the outer coast, which we try to do once or twice a month. In addition we sighted 4 or 5 migrating
gray
whales, and a tight group of about 5 harbor porpoise in association with a tiderip that had accumulated some floating debris.

Nancy Nolan of Baby Island Heights called at

3:45 pm
to report 2, maybe 3
grays
traveling fast mid-Saratoga Passage, heading NE, with a small boat hovering nearby.
*
Windwalker Taibi called at

2:20 pm
to report 2 or 3
grays
mid-channel between East Pt. & Camano. Lots of fluking, spouting & action for the nearby Island Explorer, the Capt. was keeping his distance from the whales.
*
Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called to report 2 to 4
grays
mid-Saratoga Passage between East Pt. & Camano Island at

1:10 pm
, doing deep dives. Also had a couple dozen Dall's porpoise in the area, & playing with the boat. At

2:10 pm
he reported an additional 3
grays
off Elger Bay, Camano Island, feeding & rolling in the shallows.
*
At

10:30 AM
we say a
grey
whale near Clinton at Brighton Beach going south at about 100 yards off shore. He was shallow diving then blowing every few minutes for about 5 times while we could see, so we assumed he was feeding in the area.
