Orca Sightings for April 20, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here's a great report from Tongue Pt [
near Port Angeles
] this
morning
from gary korb, a Joyce resident and kayak surfer...sent in by Rob Casey: All of a sudden this 6 foot high spear juts up out of the oncoming swell. It's a male
Orca
fin just ripping along about 100 feet away. There were only 2 of them a male and female, this means they are hunting for seals. They stayed around for about 10 minutes before heading east.
Happy surfing.........Gary

One or two
grays
traveling, again, in an easterly direction, sited to the south of the Clinton ferry dock as the
10AM
ferry took off. One whale was particularly large--the largest gray I have ever seen off Whidbey. They were actually too far out to positively identify as grays--so there is always a chance that they were not.
