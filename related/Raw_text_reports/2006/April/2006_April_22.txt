Orca Sightings for April 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
approx
5PM
: two
grays
travelling in an easterly direction, about two miles off shore, due south of Cultus Bay. What intially caught our eye were some very large splashes--may have been a couple of breeches or some tail lobbing, but by the time we grabbed the binoculars, they were just travelling along at a liesurely pace.
