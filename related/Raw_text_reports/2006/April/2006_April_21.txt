Orca Sightings for April 21, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received an interesting call from Craig, who runs a charter boat out of Emeryville, CA - on 4/21 they were out fishing for squid when they saw ~20
orcas
attacking squid, with several calves. They were near the Half Moon Bay weather buoy. He got video footage of this & will be sending it to Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research....should be interesting!!

gray

1 pm
, very active, heading north.
*
Received a call reporting [
gray
] whales off the west side of Camano at
2 pm
, north of the point.
*
From southern Camano, we saw two
grey
whales moving slowly towards Pebble Beach near Mabana. We hurried to the beach, in time to witness the whales' thrilling blows only 50 feet away (they have bad breath). This is the second time we have seen them feeding there, the last time two weeks ago. Later in the afternoon around 5, we also saw whales, number unknown, out in the middle of Saratoga Passage, moving quickly north east of Langley. There were perhaps four, from what we determined at the distance we were watching from.
