============================================================

Entry 1:
One, maybe two
grays
were on their way towards East point, Saratoga Psg @

2:15pm
this afternoon. I could still see their breathing plumes among the many white caps!

It's

1:00 o'clock
and just wanted to let you know there's some action coming your way.. I'm up a couple of miles from you on North Bluff (several miles north of Greenbank) and we are watching a tour boat follow some spouts out in the middle of Saratoga passage. Probably a
gray
or two, but too far out to see details. They're heading south..good luck!
