We saw our first thrilling sight of three
grey
whales feeding and traveling off Pebble Beach in Saratoga Passage, on the west side of the island and east of Langley on Whidbey Island. There were three of them, feeding in very shallow water just 80 feet from the water's edge. They swam back and forth, feeding on the ghost shrimp in the sand. They had approached from the middle of the Saratoga Passage towards us, fed, then swam back into the middle of the channel and headed slowly south. They approached the beach, again very close, just SE of the Wilkes Gary beach. The time of day was at low tide, around

5:00 pm
, and they swam in the area until about

7:00 pm
.

2:00 PM
- We are watching 4
gray
whales feeding off shore at Elger Bay, Saratoga Passage, Camano Island. They are currently in the bay. We have not determined which way they may be heading. We are on the bluff above Elger Bay and could not see any markings. They were here last year in the same area for several days.

We just spotted a pod off about 15
orca
2-3 miles off Copalis. There were two mature males and at least one calf. They were close together (meters), surfacing in rapid succession. It appeared they might have been the same pod we spotted in the area last year around this time. Unfortunately, they did not come close enough to photograph. We're planning to go out tomorrow from Westport for fish tracking acoustics and will have time to look for them again.

This
AM
, briefly saw 2 [
gray

4 PM
off Langley. With the sun and blue water, I could see the blows from Camano.
