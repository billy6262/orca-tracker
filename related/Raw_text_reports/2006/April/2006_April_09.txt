Orca Sightings for April 9, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
As I was crusing north in a sail boat I saw a
Minke
! We were about 1 1/2 miles south east of Apple cove located on foul weather bluff (N. Kitsap Peninsula). It was approx.

12:30 p.m
. and the whale was alone. It was traveling northward at about 6 knots. The whale stayed within fifty feet of the boat for about ten minutes and the dissapeared. We made no attempt to approach the whale or alter our course during the ten minute encounter.

I wonder if that may have been what was in Agate Pass this morning? sb

After sending out everyone else's wonderful sightings last night, I had a "hearing" of my own! While out in the hot tub between
10:30 & 11 pm, I first heard faint blows, then heard LOUD blows directly below the bluff at Hidden Beach/North Bluff 2 miles north of Greenbank. It sounded like at least 2, possibly 3,
gray
whales feeding close to shore, then traveling SE toward Holmes Harbor.

Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called to help clarify the report we had of "something other than porpoise" off Baby Island Sunday - they were out & saw porpoise at

1:30
off Baby Island, but also sighted a
Minke
whale in the same area around that time (he thought he saw a Minke on Saturday as well in Saratoga Passage not far from there, but we never were able to see it again that day). On Sunday they also found the
gray
whales along the Everett shoreline, putting on a good show.

We got a call from a friend that lives on Sandy Hook, south of the agate pass bridge (Kitsap County). She said a
gray
whale had been hanging out in front of her house for about 24 hours. We went to see it. It was only about 50 feet offshore, rolling around and bobbing up and down. Occasionally it would go under for longer amounts of time, but mostly for about an hour it was hanging out kind of slowly swimming back and forth and hanging around. I do not know what feeding behavior is but it seemed very relaxed and calm. Then it resurfaced and headed over towards Battlepoint on Bainbridge Island and then swam so towards Brownsville. I understand from another person that was down at the shore that the whale had been hanging out in this area for about a week.
