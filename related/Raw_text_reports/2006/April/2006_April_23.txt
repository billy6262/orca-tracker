Orca Sightings for April 23, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Walking west on the Langley beach tonight
near sunset
came upon two
greys
diving in the little bay, lingering there for several blows then heading East along the shore as we walked back east toward town. Some flukes, then a steady swim over to Camano.

I saw patch and another
gray
whale at the entrance to Holmes Harbor (I was in a boat). The timing was probably around

4:30 or so
. Am sure they're the same two who passed by my house (when I wasn't home) and continued on by Race Lagoon, as reported by Bruce Bardwell.

I heard
orca
calls on hydrophone
from 0345 to 0530

gray
spouting near Camano Island State Park, heading south past Elger Bay from approx.

4:15 -
4:30

We were out near Hein Bank around

2:30pm
and found 4
orcas
'playing' with a Dall's porpoise. I am not sure who we were looking at but there was definitely a sprouting male and a female with a calf. The 'show' lasted about 10-15min and involved lots of rolling around and quick surfaces.

2:10 PM - J Pod
about 5 miles off South Beach.
Maya's Whale Watch Charters
*
The call came in that
Orcas
were at Hein Bank heading South (towards Sequim). 4 miles south of Hein bank we spotted first one, then several orcas. First was J8 Speiden (still easily ID'd by her inhale). Then J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J26 Mike, J27 Blackberry (who was "babysitting" J39 Mako)! We also saw a minke whale off in the distance, as well as Dall's and Harbor Porpoises.

At Hein Bank, we encountered
Jpod
, looking to be foraging and milling about - spread out over severals miles. Clearly id'd Ruffles J1 - so glad to see him back this season, I read he had been seen already but there is nothing like spotting that magnifient animal in person!

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called in a report of 2
gray
whales between Mukilteo & Edmonds, heading north at approx.
1 pm
- they were ID'd as #22 & #383.
*

1:00 pm
. Saw a
gray
whale due east of the Possession Pt green buoy, north of the shipwreck. Heading north. Followed closely, around 100 meters or less by a tour boat.

We watched two
grays
this morning off the north end of Camano. We watched them from our place on Polnell Hts (Whidbey) for about and hour around
10am
.

10:30 to noon
, and still within sight: 5
grays
: 2 groups of 2 and 1 solo. Spread out over a very wide area (about a mile). All about 1 1/2 miles off shore (due south of Cultus Bay). One pair clearly travelling east. The other 3 pretty stationary for now.
