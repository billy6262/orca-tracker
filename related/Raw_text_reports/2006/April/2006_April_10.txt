Orca Sightings for April 10, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Scott Harris of Camano Island called to report hearing whales off Madrona Beach, west Camano Island. He heard 3 or 4 blows in quick succession, they didn't seem to be moving too fast.
*
Capt. Hollywood called to report 2
grays
(Patch & 1 other) 2 miles offshore of Bells Beach, slowly heading north at

2:25 pm.
*

9:00 AM
-There are 2, maybe 3
gray
whales mid channel between Langley and Camano headed east.

2
gray
whales feeding VERY close to shore at Hidden Beach/North Bluff. They were weaving in & out, back & forth, feeding side by side, sometimes touching each other. When they were in the shallower areas, I could see half their flukes, their pecs, & often the entire side of their body as they fed! At one point they were swimming in toward shore, & their rostrums were pointed right at me as they came up out of the water - between
4 pm &

4:20
- no real direction except back & forth across the ghost shrimp beds. Went back out at
5:30 pm, & they were still feeding, a little further south of where I first spotted them.

Adam U called to report a sighting from his surfboard off Westport! At
5 pm
he was surfing 1 mile west of the groins off the Harbor mouth, & spotted 2
grays
heading west.
*
Just had another coastal
orca
report, this time off Limantour Beach, Pt. Reyes Natl. Seashore, CA - one male & several other fins & spouts observed at

1:30 pm
by Kay Ryan.
*
Windwalker Taibi reported seeing something he couldn't readily identify off Baby Island/East Pt. at

7:30 am
. When he read the report about the Minke, he looked it up on the web & said what he saw this morning looked exactly like a
minke
(also his description of a long slow dive, with a hooked dorsal fin appearing toward the end of the dive, is quite accurate of Minke behavior). He saw it surface several times. At
4:15 pm, he observed a several smaller groups of porpoise off East Pt, who then joined together into one large pod & headed toward mid-Saratoga Passage.
*
Two whales (
grays
) feeding in front of my Mariners Cove home at
7AM
, today the 10th, bottom feeding and then moving south - they were feeding in 20-30 feet of water so lots of splashing and blowing - quite a sight --

Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island

Nate Kamplin of Makah Fisheries Management, called a little before
noon
to report 4 Southern Resident
orcas
about 1/2 mile off Neah Bay. He was able to take some ID photos which he will send to the Center for Whale Research to confirm ID's.
*
8AM
North End of Agate Pass - Noticed a lot of activity near north shore of Agate Pass. Identified several harbor seals (8 or 9) in a group near shore, along with some sea lions. They were very active, swimming back and forth. There appeared to be a few larger sea mammals that we were not able to identify that had smaller dorsal fins than we would expect for orcas. Not sure what else they could be. A lot of activity for maybe 30 minutes.
Bob Thorson (
this could possibly be the transient pod of orcas sighted off Whidbey this weekend - for those of you in the Kitsap & south Sound area, please keep a lookout for fins out there, & give us a call at 1-866-ORCANET if you see anything - thanks! sb
