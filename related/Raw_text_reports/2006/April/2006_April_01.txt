No foolin'... the very FIRST thing I saw when I opened my eyes at about 7am and looked out our window was the back of a huge gray whale breaking the surface of Saratoga Passage down at the bottom of Park Ave in Langley. And, oh boy, was the rain ever hammering down too. There he lurked for quite some time feeding on the bottom. Then he, or one of his cousins, returned to the very same spot about two hours later, around 9ish.
