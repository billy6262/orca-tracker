Orca Sightings for October 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Across Haro Strait into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We found three whales (
humpbacks
), two adults and a calf SW of Constance Bank about

2:30 p.m.
They were doing deep dives of four minutes down, then four or five breaths on the surface, then a fluke, and down. Then the show curtain went up! First a mini-breach. Then a dual breach! Bigger splashes. Then, no, BIGGER splashes, then airborne to the side, then the head up first and lunge forward, then one tail stand and one spy hop in tandem...and how about a few HUGE tail cartwheels?? Sorta like synchronized swimming routines....and on and on and on...it went for almost an hour!!! Hardly any underwater time. The mother and calf were doing many of the double behaviors. They appeared to be the same mother and calf we saw Oct. 6th and that have been seen several times since then. The other whale was adult size, and the fluke pattern consisted of much bigger white patches covering most of the fluke.
