Orca Sightings for October 14, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Tillman reporting 1
gray
whale off Admiralty Head, Whidbey Island heading south/SE at
5 pm
.
*
The tugboat Wah (?) called in a report of ~5 - 8
orcas
in Haro Strait, so. end of San Juan Island off Pile Pt. at

5:15 pm
.
*
About
2 p.m.
we found
J-Pod
in Haro Strait, one group by shore, and one group about a mile and 1/2 off Hannah Heights. We spent time watching the whales foraging, porpoise diving and swimming, more foraging, and some time just traveling. They stayed in basically the same area the entire time we were out. Looks like J-Pod is taking advantage of this run of fish as they've been spotted off the west side of San Juan for five days running now.
