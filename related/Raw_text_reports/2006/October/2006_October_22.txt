Orca Sightings for October 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We came across
J-Pod
at Otter Bay north of Mouat Point on North Pender about

3:10
this afternoon. The water was flat and calm, the sunshine bright and beautiful, and just a few boats and people aboard had the experience of watching J-pod as the family grouped up, and cruised north along the shore of North Pender Island. Ruffles, J-1, in the middle, lots of syncronized moves, everyone together, a spy hop or two, and yes, one huge breach...full belly display! By
4:10 p.m. the whales kept heading north toward Active Pass.

J Pod
was located just east of Moresby Island at Boundary Pass at approx
1 PM
. The pod was resting and moving in a Northerly direction. We left the area at approx. 2 PM. There was also a
Minke
whale in the same general area - southwest of Mouatt Point on North Pender Island. We saw it surface several times near the tideline, at approx
12:45 PM.

J-Pod
, who had been spotted around Pt. No Point yesterday snuck up Haro Strait, only to show up at Moresby Island. We caught up with the group as they passed Otter Bay heading for Active Pass. They were in an extremely tight group, and moving very leisurely, as if waiting for us to see them. Soon as they crossed the entrance to Plumper Sound, they became very active, with multiple spyhops, tail lobs, and a huge breach. Even little J-41 did a nice little spyhop with his peachy patches glowing in the sun!

Off Victoria at least 6
humpbacks
and
Transients
T103 and T104. The T's were there most of the day but went west in the late afternoon. The Humpbacks on the 22nd were within yards of where they were on the 21st but I only saw 4 on my one trip in the afternoon.

This
morning
there is a
grey
whale right outside the kelp beds; it seems to be swimming east towards Whiskey Creek (Olympic Peninsula) in a liesurely fashion. Yesterday Margaret did the noise for me and that's how I knew there was a whale out there (plus she told me there had been sightings at Low Point and Whiskey Creek, between which I am located.) I heard the breaching noise. When I saw a huge eddy I waited and sure enough it came up again, and again, again. The whale is closer in than the porpoises.
