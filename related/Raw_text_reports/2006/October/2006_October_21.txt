Orca Sightings for October 21, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
John Herman found the pod of
orcas
at

1:10 pm
between Point No Point & Kingston (Kitsap Peninsula) in the shipping lane closer to the west side, heading north slowly. At 2 pm. they were a mile south of Pt. No Pt, at
2:30 still south of Pt. No Pt. but still heading north & nearing Pt. No Pt (where they were first sighted at
7:45 &
8:45 am - they basically stayed there all day!). Then the Center for Whale Research relayed a report of the pod at
3:15 heading quickly north from Pt. No Pt, but we couldn't find them from our land-based lookout on Whidbey, & John could no longer see them from the water - not sure where they went from there! Thanks to John for getting some wonderful ID photos to confirm this was J pod -

Capt. Jim on the Victoria Clipper 4 called to report a pod of 7 - 8
orcas
w/1 male, between Hansville & Pt. No Point, Kitsap Peninsula, in the south bound shipping lanes at

8:45 am
, heading south slowly (very slow as this is the same location of the report below, an hour earlier!). They were too far away to get any ID's.

orcas
, including 3 - 4 males, heading south past Pt. No Point, Kitsap Peninsula at

7:45 am
