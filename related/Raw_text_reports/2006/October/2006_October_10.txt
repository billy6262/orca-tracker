Orca Sightings for October 10, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
4 PM
- Right below the inn and near Lime Kiln Lighthouse. After they cut the engines, they were "attacked by the [
orcas
]!!" They showed me a great photo of a spyhop not ten yards from their boat.

I wanted to let you know that we conducted one of our monthly Westport surveys yesterday. We had a bit of wind in the morning, but then things calmed down and we had a beautiful day on the water. We covered 140 nautical miles of trackline and saw 2 groups of Dall's porpoise and 8
humpback
whales, mainly up on the shelf edge. In addition to ID's of 6 of the whales, we also collected sloughed skin from one of the animals after a breach which we can use for genetics.
