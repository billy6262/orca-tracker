============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson of NOAA's NW Fisheries & Science Ctr. called to report that they caught up with the
orcas
in South Puget Sound late this afternoon, finding them between McNeil and Ketron Islands still heading south. At about

4:45 pm
the orcas turned and headed north - the researchers left them at about 5 pm. The whales were in a slow travel/resting mode, and they were ID'd as members of K and L pods.

At

2:10 PM
[
orcas
] were rounding Pt. Defiance heading into the narrows (the orcas traveling south from Vashon Isl. reported earlier in the day).

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called in the following updates on the pod off Vashon Island today:

9:50 am
: Found the
orcas
off Dilworth, NE Vashon Island, heading south. At least 15 orcas, including 3 males & a calf.

10:30 am
: Orcas still off Dilworth - looks like they may have turned around.

10:50 am
: Orcas still off Dilworth, near the shipping lanes, now turned back south, or may be milling.

11:20 am
: Orcas just passed Pt. Robinson, heading south. Not sure of ID's yet - maybe J's & L's?? - it appears there may be two groups & more males present than believed earlier - getting video & still trying to confirm ID's.

12:15 pm
: Orcas are between Gold Beach & Glacier gravel mine, in shipping lanes, resting for last half hour in same area. 1 blue & white boat nearby, being polite.

2:05 pm
: The whales continued south to the So. tip of Vashon Island, doing much breaching off Pt. Dalco then turning left & heading south around Pt. Defiance into the mouth of the Tacoma Narrows.
