Orca Sightings for October 16, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw some black fins coming out of the water in the distance (I'm 250 feet up and I was looking out to the strait) about a half mile out I'd say. I watched them and could see the bodies under the water and sometimes when they came out in particularly splashing (probably fish catching) moments. So I called Margaret Owens who is my authority since I am new here and just built a house and am getting to know everything, and she thought they sounded like the white something or other pacific dolphins and she told me to tell you. There were quite a few spread out over a distance, going west. I'd say 20-30, who knows. I am located between Whiskey Creek and Low Point, at Fielding Creek on the Juan de Fuca strait. There are kelp beds out here and I think there is a drop off; in any case this place, and the cove just before Low Point where the Lyre River comes out, is rich in water fowl. (There are also resident seals and sea otters.)
(
These could have been either Pacific White-sided dolphins, or possibly Dall's porpoise, who are known for making "rooster tail" splashes when they surface - sb
