Orca Sightings for October 3, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Residents
and
transients
all in one day. J-Pod was first heading north this morning before slowly meandering back south in the afternoon. Spent some time with the T-100's as they headed up Haro Strait. It appeared that they made some efforts at a few Dall's, but we didn't see any evidence of kills.

11:30 am
south of Lime Kiln to
3 pm
at the south end of Henry Island.

In addition to lots of Dall's feeding off Hannah Heights and Land Bank, we had
J pod
moseying up from Pile Point at around

11:45 a.m.
As I watched the J's from Hannah, I could also see a group of
transients
actively traveling in the middle of Haro Strait towards Kelp reef. The groups were no more than 4 miles apart, and perhaps less. J pod just kept slowly foraging north on the flood tide, with many direction changes. J1 Ruffles was a little south and offshore of the other groups, doing his regular angular dives in the rip currents. J26 Mike was all over, switching from group to group, and ending up just inshore of J1. J27 Blackberry was with his family lots of the time. There were lots of tail slaps, cartwheels, porpoising after fish, and more than a few breaches. The youngsters were particularly active, as usual. The transients must have heard J pod, since I could hear lots of vocalizing as the residents approached and went by Lime Kiln. When I left County Park at about
2:30 p.m., J1 was the farthest off shore and appeared to be the leader as the pod went north.

Seen on www.racerocks.com webcam today - at least one
humpback
- other whales around it. About half way between Race Rocks and Victoria. Time was
between 9 and 9.30am
. Couldn't see what was happening - too distant, but a lot of splashing and blowing. They headed off in the direction of Victoria.
