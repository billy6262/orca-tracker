Orca Sightings for October 11, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod
passing by not once, not twice, but 4 times! They were doing the classic "west side shuffle", going up to about Kellett Bluff before heading back down to False Bay. On the fourth pass, which my wife got to witness, the whales began a nice breach cycle as they headed back down island past San Juan County Park. I figure there must be some fish in the area since they have now been on the west side for 3 days running.
