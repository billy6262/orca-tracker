Orca Sightings for October 12, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I read the report today, and thought I would add that we were up in the lighthouse Thursday at sunset and saw one
orca
fin and two blow hole spouts just south of Alki Point. They were swimming south very fast and with the sun almost set we could not see much more.

, a group of 17 of us aboard the R/V Centennial observed 3 Orcinus
orca
near Shaw Island. One adult male and two smaller (female?) individuals were traveling north along the island's southwest shoreline (within 100m of land) toward the tip of Point George.
