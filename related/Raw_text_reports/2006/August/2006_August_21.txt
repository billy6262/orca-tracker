Bob & Diane Anderson aboard "Destiny" called in a report of at least 8
orcas
north of Hein Bank at

3:10 pm
, over the middle bank, with some breaching by calves going on.
*
Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at
1 pm
to report at least 6 - 8
orcas
from the Vashon Isl. ferry, heading south. One calf & 1 adult male present, they are closer to the Vashon side, nearing Dolphin Pt.
*
From the south side of Alki point I watched a group of
Orcas
traveling fast south along the East side of Blake Island and into the entrance of Colvos Passage at

12:15
today. My guess is there were 6-10 whales, possibly 1-2 males, 1 juvenile and numerous females. They spent 10 minutes milling around or feeding on the north end of Colvos Passage before continuing south.
