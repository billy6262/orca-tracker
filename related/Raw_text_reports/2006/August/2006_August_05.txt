At about

6:45 PM
a substantial group of
orcas
appeared rounding Helen Point, heading east through Active Pass. The orcas porpoised purposefully from Helen Point to Matthews Point and then all of a sudden doubled back, retracing their steps across Georgeson Bay and then heading north up Trincomali channel. Throughout they were moving very quickly and moving lots of water as they scurried about.

6:15 pm
--
orcas
travelling very quickly eastward through Active Pass. They were moving so quickly and so close together that it difficult to get a count. Much tail slapping. One group of about a dozen split off at the west entrance of the Pass and went north up Trincolmali Channel.

This morning we had
all three pods
off of False Bay
between 11 and 12
. There was a lot of milling behavior, with plenty of tail slapping and spyhops. It was nice to get a good look at some L-Pod whales as they have been pretty scarce this summer - I personally saw L41, L77, L2, L7, L57, the L55s, L83, L73, and L74. We also had some great vocalizations over the hydrophones. Just as we were leaving scene at noon, we saw a
sea otter
a little offshore from Eagle Point. Fabulous wildlife this morning!

are going up the west side of San Juan around

1:30 PM
. They weren't in a hurry as they passed Low Island heading for Kellett Bluff.

We had a great day with
minke
whales south of san juan island. we identified four whales (johnney rotten, bubbleback and 2 whales to be named later). we observed them lunge feeding and on a few occasions two whales would travel together (actual social behavior). individuals approached us on several occasions, and one lunge fed fairly close to the boat, throwing its entire body out of the water.
