Last night we spent the evening with
all three resident pods
during their return to the west side of SJI approx

6:00
or so. Those we watched were VERY spread out and full of energy. A number of breaches, fin slaps, rolls and great vocalizations going on. Saw a number of K's and J's travel North between
6:00 and

8:30- rumor has it there were others heading South. Looked like a good number of whales also made a nice, close pass by Lime Kiln.

Jim Maya was among them near Discovery Island and the south end of Vancouver Island and he said they were heading east towards San Juan Island. Sure enough, about
7 PM
they were down below, about a mile south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. The three whale watch boats drifting off shore alerted me they were here. After changing directions several times, they finally headed north.

All three pods
decided to return from the ocean today, and we spotted them heading straight across Haro Strait towards Lime Kiln Lighthouse around

6:30 PM
. Our hydrophones started picking up vocalizations from at least 5 or 6 miles away, and they were chattering away! Right before the whales got close a group of 5 or 6 Dall's porpoise passed close to shore, which we don't see too often. Then we had groups of L-Pod around the lighthouse until about
8:00 PM, with the last large group heading north and passing very close to shore. There was some spyhopping and tail slapping, and the tall spouts looked beautiful illuminated by the setting sun. Individuals spotted included L73, L74, L12, L41 and his sisters, L57, L72 and calf, L7, and L90. Also, a friend of mine reported seeing a
sea otter
at Edwards Point at 8 PM just after the whales had passed.

All 3 pods
inbound towards Race Rocks. And sure enough, we saw L's as they passed Victoria, with K's and J's following behind. L-57 Faith was traveling by himself in the lead about 3/4 mile south of the rest of the whales. Later, around

6:30 PM
, the first of the whales began passing Lime Kiln, and as I was driving home, I was listening to 88.1 FM to the hydrophone array at Lime Kiln. Lots of vocalizations and echolocation clicks could be clearly heard! Whales were spread out from Open Bay to False Bay as they slowly moved North.

Well.. after a short and well deserved vacation, the
southern residents
are back! On our way out to see them, we found a lone
Minke
Whale about half way to Victoria. We caught up with them just southwest of Victoria at about
3pm
during our first trip... We were with most of J pod for our first trip, and they gave us quite a show! We saw several breaches, a couple spyhops, and lots of tail slapping. There were several large groups moving through the straits and a few whales traveling solo. Lots of cool vocalizations as well. Our second trip we caught up with members of J pod again near Open Bay and off of Henry Island. At that time they were slowing down and foraging a bit. We Saw J-26 (Mike), and his mom Spirit. While we were watching them, J-14(Samish), J-30 (Riptide), J-37 (Hy'shqa), and J-40 (Suttles) came by as well. We had a couple spyhops tonight too.

We saw
Orcas
come thru Pickering passage between the northern tip of Squaxin Is. and the west main land again today. We only saw one...I think. Back on
July 2nd we saw three. Both times the dorsal was very tall and straight and they were moving fast towards the south...towards Hope Island.
