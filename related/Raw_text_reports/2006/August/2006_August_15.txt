Orca Sightings for August 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
My 18-yr- old daughter saw
orcas
off Pt. Robinson on Vashon Island, Washington. There were six individuals, one tall fin. They were definitely orcas - white saddles. The whales appeared to be playing! They were breaching, spy-hopping, and swimming up to boats. My daughter was babysitting several small children who started to yell and wave and run up and down the beach. Whales moved in to see them and splash with flukes and flippers. They seemed to be moving in a leisurely fashion towards Tacoma.

Those were
T's
off of Whidbey. We followed them in from the Strait past Point Wilson and around Marrowstone Point. Two males, two young whales, one very very small calf, and one or two adult females.

Upon receiving reports of a pod of
orcas
heading SE off Bush Pt. & Mutiny Bay, I jumped in the car & headed for SW Whidbey hoping to catch a glimpse. I didn't get the reports until 7 pm, so made a guess that I might catch up with them off S. Whidbey. I lucked out & got to Scatchet Head at
8 pm
, just as they were heading SE between Scatchet Head & the tip of the Kitsap Peninsula! First I saw a group of 3, with another group of 2 or 3 not far behind. Then quite a bit later, another pod of 3, including 1 male showed up. I watched until
8:30, but the light was fading & they were on the Peninsula side by the time I got to them. At
8:30 they were nearing Kingston, still heading SE.

1420 Hrs
- In the Strait, Approximately one-half mile north of Green Point (Olympic Peninsula between Port Angeles and Dungeness Spit), at least five
orcas
(1 adult male, 1 adult female, 1 calf and 2??? (juveniles or adult females, etc.,). Circling, as if in feeding, at this location. First heard (tail slaps) and then were seen from our home. This group may have been responsible for “tail slaps” heard over the past two nights at roughly the same location (there are also seals in the area).
