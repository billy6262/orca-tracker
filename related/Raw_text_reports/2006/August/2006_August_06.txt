Orca Sightings for August 6, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
6pm
, South Lopez between Aleck Bay and Iceberg Point. There were two small boats towing what appeared to be northwest
native canoes
west toward Iceberg Point. An unusual sight on any day. What made it truly remarkable was that the two canoes were
escorted by at least two dozen
orcas
. There were orcas on all four sides of the boats. The orcas were much more active than we usually see down here, with lots of breaches, tail slaps, pectoral slaps and spy hops.

We encountered three
Minkes
approximately 1 mile west of the northern tip of Patos Island at

10:45 AM
. They surfaced twice .. we set dead in the water for 15 minutes with no siting. We then continued on our way south approximates .5 mile and had another siting of one which surfaced twice. Looking back from where we came we saw the other two that surface thre times.

Yes, there are
blue whales
along the coast of
California
. I've seen them frequently along the southern California coast by Long Beach and Dana Point since the beginning of July. I've attached a photo I took today from the Ocean Institute boat out of Dana Point Harbor.
