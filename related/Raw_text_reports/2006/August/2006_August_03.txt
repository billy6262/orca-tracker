Orca Sightings for August 3, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found
K-Pod
just off the Salmon Bank marker. They were spread out over several miles, and were definitely in a foraging mood. Just as the captain did his salmon dance for our passengers, one of the nearby boats said they were seeing lots of salmon swimming by! As we watched K20 Spock and her youngster swim by, we dropped the hydrophone in just in time to hear some incredibly clear and LOUD vocalizations. Sounded just like kittens to me, and the whales were in no hurry to get anywhere for most of the afternoon. They were making a big zig-zag, and all 5 boats on scene just sat parked with engines off for almost 30 minutes. As we left, all the K's began to gather up and head west towards Victoria.
