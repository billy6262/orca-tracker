Orca Sightings for August 29, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Connie Barrett of Camano Island called at

6:30 pm
to report a
whale
(possibly more) off the west side of Camano Island, north of the State Park, heading north. The whales were close in to shore, gray in color, large spouts but no dorsal fin. A whale watch boat had stopped to observe them, so hopefully we'll get a report & confirmation on species...

Karen Munro called to report a mom & calf
Transient
orcas in Cowichan Bay, BC, just feeding in the bay around
4 pm
. There were several whale watch boats & private boats, & DFO enforcement was out handing out educational pamphlets & reminding boaters to Be Whale Wise.
*
2 small
killer whales
on east side of Camano Island headed up into Port Susan sighted about

12:00
. Sighting made by Carolanne Swenson and reported to Cascadia Research.

We went all the way into Canadian waters to find whales. By the time we arrived, we saw two
Transient
Orca whales at a considerable distance away. A Mom and her baby.
Lynda Imburgia and Margerie Monteperto
South Whidbey Island, WA.

A group of us were in Nanaimo, B.C. SCUBA diving a couple wrecks just east Snake Island when we were greeted by a small pod of
orcas
heading toward the island. I was able to shoot a few photos although I have been having the hardest time identifying them. The captain claimed it was a pod of
transients
which would match up to your other 8/29 sightings in Cowichan Bay. The issue I have with that is a few of them had open saddle patches and I thought that meant they could not be transients. I have attached a few photos to aid in identification and the photos were all taken between

1:48 pm and
1:53 pm
.
