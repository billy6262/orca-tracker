I am happy to report I saw
orcas
! I observed
Transients
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca south of San Juan Island from

6:15-
7:15 pm
. There was at least 1 male and 3 females or immature according to the naturalist on board. This group had been initially reported as moving fast but when we arrived, the naturalist described them as appearing to be in their resting mode.
