Orca Sightings for August 26, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had two
Minke
sightings. The first was in the Guemes Channel at

2:10 PM
. It surfaced three times going east. The second was in the channel between Fidalgo Island and Burrows Island at
2:30 PM. There were three sightings in changing directions as if foraging.

J? youngster "playing" with a baby? harbor porpoise. My friends were sailing from snug to seattle. At approx
11AM
they were at false bay and saw a young
Orca
swimming with a light grey porpoise about 2-3 feet long. They appeared to be swimming along side each other and twice the smallish orca nugged the porpise with it's snout pushing it through the water. They chased each other several times, taking turns.

I want to let you know that the whale that I reported on Thursday is still frequenting the Nisqually buoy area. This morning at about

6:30 am
, it again surfaced twice in the same area. This time I had the light behind me - it was clearly a
minke
. There is a lot of whale in front of the dorsal fin! This morning he came up quite close to several boats - within 100' - eliciting many comments from the fisherman. ("Fish on!", "Hey honey, look what I caught!", you get the idea.) And like last night, after surfacing, he wasn't seen again. There are large schools of herring holding in the vicinity of the buoy - maybe the feed is holding the whale in the area.
