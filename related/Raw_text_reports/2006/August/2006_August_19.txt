Orca Sightings for August 19, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the evening the
L-5s
were southeast bound slowly foraging .5 NM SE of Hein Bank. We observed most of the sub group over the period
1930-2030
. The whales appeared intent on looking for fish in the post sunset twilight.

Kristen Stancata called to report a lone
orca
in Pickering Passage, S. Puget Sound
9 am
, very close to shore at low tide, near a porpoise & a seal. She also had observed the pod of orcas that were in Pickering Passage in July, & said the size of this one was somewhere between a calf & an adult, likely a younger whale.

Our dinner guests reported that they saw
three spouts
in north Hood Canal (south of Hansville, north of Port Gamble) around

7:45 pm
tonight but were unable to sight any fins.

We had a great night with some of
L-pod
down off of American Camp/Salmon Bank Area. We were with L2 (Grace) and her gang (L67 Splash, L78 Gaia, L88 Wavewalker, and L101 Aurora). They were spread out for a little while, but then all got together and headed south. During the time when they were all together, Aurora branched off and headed towards another male that was way out.

A
superpod
came in from the west. I started seeing them at about

10:45 am
as they headed up island from about the False Bay area, with the J's leading. At Andrews Bay the J's and K's went north, while many of the L's turned south. As they fought the flood tide, they alternately drifted, foraged and porpoised. When they got to Land Bank three groups of about 8 to 12 orcas engaged in behavior I had never seen. The group that was farthest south turned north and appeared to be lined up for a greeting ceremony. The northern group also formed a horizontal line. As the group that was farther north approached, the southern group wheeled and went back south several hundred yards. Then it turned north again and the northern group went south a couple hundred yards. Then another group of about 8 to 12 lined up whales appeared from the north, and the two groups did essentially the same thing, with all three groups still in the Land Bank area. During this entire time all three groups were visible floating on the surface about 70% of the time. They stayed at Land Bank for at least an hour doing this surface float in three groups. Interesting, to say the least. All three groups then went south to the Eagle area, then offshore. I left them at about
7 pm
. I'm not sure where they ended up.

Over by Ft. Flagler spotted a
minke
whale, about 100 feet from the boat. The minke was heading west, time was approx
4 pm
.

We were fortunate enough to encounter
K pod
(and others I'm told) heading north around

2:00 PM
at the Turn Point lighthouse. Very spread out, and as the whales passed the lighthouse, they'd get a brief burst of speed.

10:00 a.m
. trip - At Eagle Point we found three adult
orca
, two males from L pod, traveling north, and stopping to forage. We had a nice pass by Nyssa, L-84 and L-74, Saanich. They were in no hurry, although we heard the "rest" of the whales were already further up north along the island. We proceeded further up Haro Strait, & came across more whales, who were definitely in a traveling mode. We were able to parallel them moving along at 5.2k, for at least 40 minutes. There were several breaches and a tail slap or two. I sensed that there were many more whales around us, but they were very spread out across Haro Strait and to the north.

2:00 p.m. trip
- the whales were continuing to move north with the flood tide and so we had an "express" trip to the north. Along the shore of North Pender Island, there were four or five whales shopping for their dinner close to shore. I mean, REALLY close to shore. As they traveled about just feet from the rocky shore, we kept our 1/4 mile stand off and watched from a distance. Then we moved further up the island to the leading whales. Up by Mouat Point we found J-1, Ruffles, J-2, Granny, and....yes, L-57, Faith! Faith was traveling with the J Pod again! We were able to parallel the whale and see whales out in the center of Swanson's Channel to our left, and whales to the right of us following the island shore to the north. It was then we realized we had the K's along with the J's as K-21, Cappucino, and K-40, Raggedy came by the stern of the boat and totally passed us on the right.
