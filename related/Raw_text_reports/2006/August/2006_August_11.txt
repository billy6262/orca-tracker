Orca Sightings for August 11, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nice to see the
orcas
again off Salmon Bank and Eagle Cove this
morning
in amongst the purse seiners. I was just watching an adult male head west around Eagle Point about

4:40 pm
, a
gray
whale (or two) were feeding nearby just off the shallow part of the cove. The whale(s) were around for a while, doing the pattern of a long dive followed by shorter recovery intervals near the surface.

Draw a line from the
L12's
at False Bay, go back and forth a half dozen times between Pile Point and Eagle Point....then have that line go East past Lopez Island, and start heading slightly north up Rosario. Pick up your chalk and now go back up to the Frasier River where we left the
J's, K's and most of L's
. Draw them coming towards Point Roberts. Draw that line back towards the River. Southeast of Cattle Pass, a
minke
whale. A
Gray
whale several miles south of False Bay.
