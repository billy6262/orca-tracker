Orca Sightings for August 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
My name is Jeff Lamarche and I'm the Senior Skipper/Company Biologist at Seafun Safaris Whale Watching in Victoria B.C. I've been a whale watcher for 11 years and my afternoon trip today was my favourite trip yet !!!!!!!!! 52 nautical miles West of Victoria to a couple miles South of Port Renfrew, B.C. At
1630
hrs. we picked up
J,K and L pods
2.6 nm South of San Juan Pt. (48 degrees 30. 449 N ; 124 degrees 30. 581 W) All three pods were spread out foraging (no direction of travel at this point). At 1745 hrs. the pods started to travel West at 5 kts. spread out from 1 nm to 3 nm offshore from San Juan Pt. At
1810
hrs. a few miles East of San Juan Pt. I spotted a
Gray
Whale right along the shoreline at Providence Cove. (48 degrees 31. 095 N; 124 degrees 24. 141 W). The whale was headed in an Easterly direction at 2 kts. At Sombrio Beach (48 degrees 29. 427 N ; 124 degrees 17. 624 W) we spotted another adult
Gray
Whale feeding in the shallows. We shut off our engines and watched the whale from an offshore position. Brett Soberg from Eagle Wing Tours radioed me to tell me that he had found 3 other
Gray
Whales about 4 miles East of my location at Magdalena Pt. At
1850
hrs. I arrived at Magdalena Pt. (48 degrees 27. 481 N; 124 degrees 12. 468 W) to find one adult Gray Whale swimming by himself about 300 yards offshore traveling slowly Eastwards. This Whale had a foot-long gash on his back just in front of the dorsal knuckes. About 500 yards East of this animal, were two other Sub-adult Gray's that Brett was viewing. These two Whales were much smaller than the previous three. They were playing in the mud very close to shore and swimming right next to each other. We watched lots of rolling, pectorals in the air, tail flukes and spyhopping. The water was churning with sand and mud from the bottom.

Saw a pod of 10
Orcas
in Elliott Bay while sailing today from
1615 to 1700
. They were slowly heading north. Lots of activity with hops and fin action. Look like at least two youngsters. The large male had a crook in the tall dorsal fin so hope that helps with the ID.

Several
orca
milling about off Alki Beach,

2:30 p.m.

2:45
- they continue to work their way slowly north in a tight group. Appear to be fishing together, some tail slaps and related behavior, and surfacing pretty much all at once. We count seven, including a baby and a good-sized adult or sprouter male. They are off the mouth of Elliott Bay now, staying in the same place.

3:40 pm
update: They are on their way to Nordstrom's. The orcas have entered Elliott Bay proper, followed by a small entourage of tour boats. I hope lots of people get to see them in Elliott Bay, and that someone gets great photos.

A pod of about 8
Orca
crossed in front of Spring Beach at about

10:20 AM
. this morning. They headed to Sunrise Beach and swam north past Pt. Richmond. They then crossed Colvos Passage again, headed to the Vashon side. There was one large male (?) and the rest were small. They seemed to be moving at an easy pace and close together. The male would surface and breathe then the others would surface in a tight group.
