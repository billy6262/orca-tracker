This afternoon we followed 4
transients
(T30, T30A, T30B, and T30C) north in Haro Strait, leaving them this evening at

6:45
north of Turn Point, Stuart Island, heading NE into Boundary Pass. We deployed another suction-cup attached time-depth recorder/VHF radio tag (on T30C) that was still attached when we left, and hoping it'll stay on through at least part of the night. During the time we followed the whales they made at least 5 kills, including a couple confirmed harbor seals, and possibly a porpoise or two.

2pm
trip out by Race Rocks. So many
T's
passing by, a good 20 or so all in all. I leave it to the experts to I.D, but I do know we had T41, T41A and T44 in one big group of 7-8 animals, the same number behind them, heading for Race Rocks from the NE, and T12 and her son T12A coming in from Becher Bay. White water created by these 2 indicated a kill occuring.
Watch the below transients passing Race Rocks video
. We witnessed a female and juvenile toying, and playing cat and mouse with a young harbour porpoise. Chasing, spinning, lunging, dorsal's zipping through the water. Do excuse the screaming from Marine Biologist Jacklyn, and the uncontrolable breathing and heart palpatations from myself. We do try and be professional, but times like this .. all professionalism out of the window! View the below video links in order, and enjoy ...

We found four
transients
, (possibly the T-30's) cruising up the west side of San Juan Island about

2:15 p.m
. There was one large male, a female and calf and a juvenile in the group. They had just made a kill upon our arrival according to the Cascadia Research boat, which was on scene. The whales continued north, traveling, and then suddenly swerving and diving in foraging action. At one point we saw a seal surface in between our boat and another boat. The whales were headed directly for the spot where we last saw the seal. Again blood was spotted in the water by the research boat. We were treated to several adult spy hops and lots of zippy action by the littlest member of the family.
