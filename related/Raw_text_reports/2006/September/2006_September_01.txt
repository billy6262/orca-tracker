Orca Sightings for September 1, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we had a
super pod
off the west side of San Juan Island after having no residents the last 3 days!! While floating on the water, we watched whales in every direction, going every direction, and spread out over several miles in each view! The whales would speed along a drift line of current, then stop and circle repeatedly while hunting fish. Then they would play for awhile, then speed on a short way, and repeat the cycle many times. Our eyes were treated to many incredible sights of whales hunting, cartwheeling, an upside down back slide that was like a reverse porpoise, and our ears were treated to loud and frequent calls as whales hunted, played, and mated. We had a beautiful pass with L105 traveling with mom L-72 (including some playful rolling around and a mini-spyhop).The whales seemed to just be content spread out doing their own thing.
