Orca Sightings for September 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

7:15 P.M
., from the Burrows Channel overlook in Washington Park (Anacortes) looking back to Burrows Bay, we observed a marine mammal that we are fairly certain was a
minke
whale. It was about due east of the north shore of Burrows Island, slowly moving south. About a mile from us, but with binocs we could see some detail. It had a very small but distinct dark dorsal fin on a long dark body. It came to the surface and blew several times in a row, and after a few minutes did another series of breaths. It seemed to linger just under the surface between breaths, rather than diving.

Transients
were found today off of Patos Island. I didn't get out to see them, but heard it on the VHF around

1:30 PM
. Heard they were very active, but not feeding.

The whale watching fleet found a group of
transients
off Patos Island, and we spent a couple hours with them this afternoon. We haven't gone through the photos yet, but whales present included T20 (aka O20), T21 (aka O21), T100, T100c, T101 (aka AL42), and T102. We thought there were at least 10 and possibly 12 whales present. Last seen north of East Point, Saturna, about 5 PM, heading NW.
