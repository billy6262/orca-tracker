Orca Sightings for September 10, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
T41-44
trio cut a swath through the East Sooke and basin area. predating on at least one and more likely two harbour seals from the colony tucked away in the Bedford Islets in eastern Beecher Bay. Sherrie spotted the three inside of the Race Rocks Marine Protected Area. Link to the hunting image: http://static.flickr.com/87/240227983_71e0778c92_b_d.jpg. The Ts spent most of the day in the area between Race Rocks and the Sooke Bluffs. In the early afternoon the orca luncheoned on a harbour porpoise near Secretary Island. We watched the Ts. for about 30 minutes at
1530
. Around
1545
we heard a lot of excited chat on the VHF about a
Minke
whale amongst the Transients. We were amazed to see a 20-24 foot Minke whale high-speed porpoising away from the three orca. Link to image file: http://static.flickr.com/92/240220508_f5413c9c11_b_d.jpg. The Minke porpoised in a true westerly direction for at least three miles and continued to do so until we could see it no longer. A couple of WW Captains said they saw the Orca chasing it a bit past their boats. As we returned to the northeast we stopped to see the Ts one more time and now they had a small harbour seal they were playing with. The whales "played with their food" for over 30 minutes before eventually eating the unlucky pinniped.

On Sunday
afternoon
we encountered a group of
transients
in Admiralty Inlet near Bush Point. We followed the group northbound, though they didn't cover much ground over the few hours we were with them (last seen south of Marrowstone Point, slowly heading north into a flood current). Whales present included T101, T101A, T101C, T102, T100, T100C, T100B, another T100 calf (presumably T100D), T90, T124, T124D, T124E, and possibly T124C. We deployed one of our suction-cup attached time-depth recorders on T100B. During the period we followed the group there were two kills, a porpoise (we collected a small muscle sample to confirm this genetically), and a harbor seal. The next day we found the tag floating SW of Hein Bank (located using the VHF radio signal), and when we downloaded the data confirmed the tag had stayed on 13 hours, coming off at about
4:45 on Monday morning. Some interesting dive patterns that will take a while to analyze, but particularly interesting that there were clear changes in diving behavior associated with the two kills, with the whales rapidly ascending (from about 10-15 m) and then diving much deeper (34-55 m). I've put some photos and an example of the dive data on the
Cascadia web site
(for those who are squeamish, you may not want to look at the last photo).

Ron Bates called at

12:30 pm
to report 10+
orcas
off Double Bluff, W. Whidbey Island heading north, the same pod of
Transients
seen the evening before.
*
We spotted
Orcas
south of Port Townsend heading in a Northwesterly direction toward Port Townsend. NOAA was with the pod and had tagged one of the smaller orcas for research. We learned it was a transient pod. They were coming from the South heading northwest. They were moving about 3 knots.

I was Salmon fishing just West of the shipping lane separation buoy off West Point (discovery park). At approx
8am
a pod [
orcas
]appeared to be 6 in number with at least one large dorsel fin spotted. Pod appeared to be playing leaping, flipping etc and heading north toward Pt. Monroe area off of Bainbridge Island. Pulled the lines and watched the show from a distance.
