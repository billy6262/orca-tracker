Cap'n Sherry from Seacoast spotted 8-10
T-100 clan orca
near Constance Bank, just off Victoria, located three miles south of the Harbour entrance. How she saw them in such nasty seas is a mystery to me. The crew, Ron Bates and I arrived "on scene" with the FastCat, The seas were in the 5+ range, mostly being generated by a heavy outflow ebb.

The T-100 clan was the only group we saw and they led us on interesting journey as they moved rapidly through one wide tide rip to the next in a southeasterly direction. At times the rips were so rapid that the orca literally surfed through the center of 6 foot waves and then at the edge of the current, pop out into the stiller water of a back eddy. In the calm they would rest-travel and then race through the next outflow. Seeing this combination of skill and exertion gave me even more respect for their will to go where they want, when they want. Ron Bates heard from friends that the T-100 were heading north up Admiralty Inlet along Whidbey. Later Robin Baird said the T-100s had around a half dozen more Ts for company. T41, 41a and T44 were found out at Race Rocks this morning.
