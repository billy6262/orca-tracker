Orca Sightings for September 2, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had about 11
transients
near Java Rocks tonight on our evening charter. There were 5 whales traveling together heading East in Boundary Pass toward Java Rock were they changed direction and headed south to meet up with 6 other whales coming North into Boundary. They met up and started rolling around at the surface also spyhopping, breaching, taillobbing and repeated head stands. It was amazing to watch!! We ID T46, T44 and a new calf born in Feb.06, T100D (according to Dave from the Center, who ID the young calf earlier today).

We had
all three pods
of residents at the Fraser River. They came porpoising over the Strait of Georgia, then right past the South Arm of the Fraser, with some settling down to do a little foraging between the South Arm and Airport, while others kept going even further North. The vocals were amazing, even while they were doing all that high speed swimming. There are lots of of sockeye salmon jumping in the river and on the tide flats just outside of it.

Today we headed for what was reported to be L12's by Hein Bank - turned out to be
transients
!! Looked to me to be T20, T18, and maybe T19B (young male)?? i'm not positive, it was my first real serious attempt at IDing transients......there were three others - T20 and T19B (?) split off from the rest of the group and spent a good part of the day hanging together as they traveled north, just a couple hundred yards or so from the rest of them. Anyhoo, there were a couple of other transient groups spotted today in the Haro Strait area also - J,K,L's all went just plain north to the Fraser apparently.

I did catch a group of 6
transients
travelling north at about noon. They were identified by others as T20's and T18's. At False Bay a family of river otters scurried up the rocks just before the transients went by. At a beach about a mile north, the water fowl paid the transients no mind. Just as I was leaving to go farther north, three of the transients popped up right at the kelp line, about 20 yards maximum from the shore. They then traveled close inshore by Hannah Heights where an elephant seal had been hanging around. It dove minutes before the transients arrived. The transients circled for awhile, but then moved offshore without finding the elephant seal, apparently.

Lots of blowing sounds from
[orcas]
going north by Hannah on the west side of San Juan Island at
6:30 AM this morning.I listened to them as they headed for Lime Kiln Lighhouse. No tail slapping heard, just heavy breathing!
