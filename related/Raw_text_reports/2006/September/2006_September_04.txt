Orca Sightings for September 4, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

8:00am
a huge
Orca
surfaced just 100 feet off shore. We were just South of Grandpa's beach (on SW side of Bainbridge, just north of the Pt White pier. Directly across from Illahee State Park). We only saw him one more time as he surfaced once again down in front of the public fishing pier.

The notorious "west-side shuffle" was in full effect today. We left the harbor going one way, and ended up turning around and going around south, while the
southern residents
decided to turn back north, and as we were arriving on scene, some headed back south.. whew! Eventually we caught up with them. As we arrived some animals starting porpoising southbound. We saw L73(Flash), L41(Mega), L25 (Ocean Sun), and What I believe to have been K22 and K41, the new calf, and K28 and K39 as they were very orange and very small!
