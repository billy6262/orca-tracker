Orca Sightings for September 24, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
In the
afternoon
we heard rumors of
transients
, and we lucked into T20 and T21 off of White Rock heading toward Waldron

Well, the
residents
decided that Active Pass was a nice place to be in the early morning, passing through around
8-9 AM
, then they headed into the fog towards the Fraser River. But we still managed to see the
transients
on the west side of San Juan, and had a nice viewing of the T100's. Surprisingly enough, the transients decided to try their hand at going through Mosquito Pass. The other group of transients that had been following nearby decided to turn around just prior to Open Bay and headed down island towards Hannah Heights, where they apparently made a big kill on a Harbor Porpoise.

Today,
Residents
galore off of the west coast of San Juan Island. We spent most of our time with members of
K-Pod
offshore. The little ones were especially active today.

Our first sighting of 2 whales (
K7 & K25
) was a relief, but we knew there were more out there. We slowly made our way offshore and were rewarded with sighting a group of approx 12 whales travelling together including L57, Faith. We stayed with this group for a a few passes. It was a very different experience for our passengers to see the whales appearing out of the fog, then disappearing again. At one point, the whales started spyhopping repeatedly - one even spyhopped while travelling horizontally. Then several whales breached repeatedly, and the group started porpoising. Shortly after this, we came out of the fog and soon we could see groups of whales spread out for miles. We were almost in line with the South Arm of the Fraser River. The point where all the spyhops and breaches started must have occurred when the whales first encountered the fresh water plume. As it turns out, the
entire Southern resident community
was there, including the L12's.
