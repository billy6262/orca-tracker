Orca Sightings for September 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
The employees at the Point Whitney Shellfish Lab saw a single
minke
whale swim by this morning at
0955
. The animal surfaced 3 times on its southerly course about 100 ft. offshore.

We recovered the tag deployed on T101A off Nanaimo and it stayed on for about 10 hours. We've
updated the web page
with additional information on the study, as well as photos and dive data from some of our recent transient encounters, in case folks are interested.

At LandBank we watched 4
T's
about a mile off the west side of San Juan Island from

6:30 pm to
7:30 pm
. I think it was T30 and family, although I didn't hear anyone identify them. A seal was hiding under an inflatable at the stern of Orca Spirit, according to Annie Mae. The whales circled Orca Spirit, swam back and forth, and under and up, many times. The
transients
finally continued south, letting Orca Spirit leave the scene. From the radio reports the seal apparently survived. After traveling for another 10 - 15 minutes, the transients again began circling, after diving for several minutes. Don't know whether they made a kill, or not, because we were too far away.

Mark from the Victoria Clipper 4 called to report a
Minke
north of McCurdy Pt in the Strait of Juan de Fuca at

7:05 pm

On Friday morning we went north looking for the suction-cup attached time-depth recorder (TDR) we had deployed on T30C on Thursday. Brad had heard the tag off and floating at the surface (based on the continuous beeps on the VHF transmitter) at 7 AM, so we knew the tag was to the north of Orcas Island. We recovered the tag in the southern Strait of Georgia, and then went looking for the transients, hoping they were still in the area. A couple hours later we found a large group of
transients
north of East Point, Saturna Island, heading northwest up the Strait. We followed them until
5 PM
, identifying the T101s, T102, T124s, and T100s, a total of at least 11-12 whales. We haven't gone through the photos yet, so there may have been one or two more whales present. During the encounter we witnessed them killing at least two harbor porpoises, one harbor seal, and at least one other marine mammal that we weren't able to identify to species. We managed to deploy another suction-cup attached TDR, this time on T101A, and the tag was still attached when we left the group at 5 PM. No VHF signals from the tag yet this morning, so it is either still on T101A or they continued north in the Strait of Georgia and the tag fell off out of our range (we can hear the VHF signals from about 80 km from the top of Mt. Dallas on San Juan Island). The TDR from T30C stayed on till
2:13 yesterday (Friday) morning, almost 12 and a half hours of dive data. We'll put an example of the dive data up on the
Cascadia web site
, as well as a couple photos from the encounter from Friday. The most surprising thing from the dive data were some very deep dives, with the deepest to
243 m (797 feet
). We've recorded deeper dives from resident killer whales before, but the deepest we've previously documented from a transient was 101 m (in 64 hours of dive data). We were not with T30C when he/she made the deep dives (they were around 9 PM), so can't say why they were making the deep dives. T30C is fairly young (perhaps 2-3 years?), so clearly indicates that even very young killer whales are able to dive to the bottom in such deep water. Robin

A group of four
transients
were reported, coming down Boundary Pass headed west and south. We reached the transients, again the T-30's, as they were traveling west down Boundary Pass and then making the turn at, yes, Turn Point, south down Haro Strait. We had lots of nice viewing as the mother and calf traveled apart from the adult male and juvenile. Then they all grouped up and started group swimming down the strait. Suddenly ahead I saw some splashes and fins ripping through the water. Then it all made sense, as Dall porpoise erupted out of the water making a speedy escape back past our boat going north. The T-30's suddenly took off in speed swimming and porpoise diving themselves as fast as they could. We watched as the whales porpoised so fast they actually came totally out of the water as if flying through the air, then down in the water, and then back up in the air! You could actually see the entire whale airborne. I was so stunned, although I had my camera, I never got a picture of it. We kept expecting a kill, but the whales just slowed down to regular traveling, and kept moving south. So, it appeared the Dall porpoise was not part of the menu at that moment. As we stopped the boat to watch as the whales continued swimming south in their tight family group we could hear the blows as they passed by us. The smallest member of the family was once again as active as he/she was yesterday, adding many tail slaps and mini cartwheels to the list of today's accomplishments. There is nothing quite like seeing the magnificent black fins gliding through flat water in the late afternoon sun. The mist from the blows was visible a long way off.
