Orca Sightings for July 14, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
L Pod
coming up the west side of San Juan Island near Low Island around

11:00 AM
. It was great to see L-41 Mega and others foraging as they fought the strong ebb tide. Even nicer was seeing K21 Cappucino with K40 Raggedy return to our waters after "disappearing" for awhile (perhaps with the rest of the L's that came it?). Lots of percussives with multiple cartwheels, tailslaps, and breaching.
