Orca Sightings for July 12, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were with
K pod
on the west side of San Juan Island. We left them at about
8pm
traveling south towards South Beach. We had several looks at the new baby K-39. I'm also pretty sure that L-79 (Skana) was hanging around with K pod.
