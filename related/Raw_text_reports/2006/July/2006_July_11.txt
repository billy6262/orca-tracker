============================================================

Entry 1:
John Schrunk called with a report of ~ 5
orcas
off Coos Bay/Charleston
OR
, SW 1/2 mile from the end of the jetty on either
July 10 or 11th. There were 2 males present, 1 of them with a bit of a bend at the top of his fin.

Our afternoon trip met up with
J Pod
near the south end of Lummi Island. They had been heading Southbound, but past the bottom of Lummi Island they started milling about in an area with some tide rips. By this time, the incoming tide was likely slowing their southbound progress. It didn't take long and they had turned and headed back northbound, but at a very slow pace, as though they were just letting the tide carry them. Some were swimming in their matrilines, some singly or in pairs. J1 and J2 were leisurely travelling side by side. We left J Pod drifting in the general direction of Lummi Rocks at 5 PM.

A group of kayakers from our shop were out off of the West anchorage in Elliott Bay paddling with what must be a minke or possibly a gray (or possibly the juve
humpback
?) from

6:30-
7:00
. A police vessel was also with the whale, looking out for its well being while freight ships and tugs continued to work.
