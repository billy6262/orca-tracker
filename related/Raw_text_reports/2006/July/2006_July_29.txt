Regarding the information on the
Minke
Whale Project - I realize that Jonathan Stern is studying the Minke up in your area but I thought I would send 2 photos that I took of a Minke in the Santa Barbara Channel
CA
off the coast of California (from the condor Express). I have seen Minkes off the California coast before but they only showed themselves once or twice before disappearing and I was not able to catch any photos. To everyone's delight, this one hung around for about 8 minutes!
