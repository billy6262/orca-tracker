Orca Sightings for July 31, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received a report from Robert Anthony, a commercial fisherman of 2
orcas

1:45 pm
, heading north off the coast at 41.47.06 N 124.24.01 W (18.0 km WxSW of Klamath

Around
5 pm
the [
orcas
] who had gone north yesterday came back south widely spread across Haro Strait. The L12's traveling north, met lines of whales that were rapidly porpoising south just off Lime Kiln Point. Mega preceded the greeting with two mega breaches. (See photos: http://orcanetwork.org/images/photopage.html). After mingling for awhile and spreading out even further, the whales headed south. They then engaged in great behaviors, including multiple breaches, tail slaps, tail throws and other percussive and non-percussive behavior for hours off Hannah Heights. They seemed to switch from family groups, to mating groups, to foraging groups and back frequently. When I stopped watching them at 8pm, they were widely spread from near Eagle Point to Edwards Point, inshore all the way out to several miles off shore. I also saw lots of salmon jumping close to the shore.
