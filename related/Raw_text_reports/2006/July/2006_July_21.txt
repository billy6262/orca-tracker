Entry 1:
A fine whale show this
evening
around

8:30
.
J pod
, spread out, heading east through Active Pass. Very active around Georgeson Bay -- breaching, tail slapping, spy hopping. Right in front of us, swimming on backs at the surface and under the water.

Today we had the
J's and K's
off the west side almost all day long, often playing to near capacity crowds from shore. They were just north of Beaumont Shoals at about

9:15 a.m
, crossed Haro Strait to Land Bank and Lime Kiln, and then shuffled up and down the west side most of the day. There was lots of surface activity, many tail slaps, tail throws, a number of breaches and much foraging. While there were many boats, the whales did not seem bothered. In the afternoon I saw three young calves traveling south together off Land Bank. J26 Mike and J1 Ruffles seemed to be the babysitters, as the three little ones would swim from one to the other, and back. Both Mike and Ruffles were kelping as they babysat. K pod put on an amazing show at one point, porpoising in unison tight into shore. This was after they had spent about 45 minutes really tight into shore off Lime Kiln Point, playing and foraging. K40 Raggedy and K21 Cappucino spent a lot of time off Land Bank close in to shore rolling around each other and hanging out. It was after that that they went out to the middle and found the porpoise. J pod went north around

2:30 pm
, while K pod went south. K pod was off Salmon Bank heading further south after 7 pm.

I and my students arrived around
9 AM
, and learned that
J-pod
was across Haro, just south of Discovery Island, just milling around with no particular direction of travel. Around

10:35 AM
roughly 15+
orca
came from the south, perhaps three-quarters to a mile offshore of Lime Kiln. Spread out, and moving to the north, with a few of them circling and doubling back, until approx.
11:10 AM. At least one mother with a young one in the lead of that pass. Then, from around
11:30 to
12:30, a second pass--they had turned around and headed back south, much closer to shore this time. Seemed like more of them in this pass; did they pick some up who were coming down from the north? J-1 we think, a little further off, but several others VERY close to shore, just outside the kelp line, from just north of the Light house all the way down past the Lime Kiln overlook and even south of that. Again spread out greatly, and leisurely moving south, with several groups doubling back and circling around. A third pass, from roughly
1:15 to
2:00 PM, moving fairly rapidly north with the tidal flow. Combined over these three viewings we saw, cart-wheels, tail slaps, pec. slaps, pec. waves, several spy-hops, tail slaps while up-side down, pec. slaps while up-side down, a combo. tail and pec. slap while upside down (love seeing those pretty white bellies just below the water surface), and one younger whale did at least 5 full breaches in succession. Some of the tail slaps so forceful, you could hear them even some distance away, and of course, many breaths heard as they came to the surface. Lots of close passes, giving all us shore-based watchers some GREAT viewing. Guess this was a good example of the "west side shuffle."

K40, K35 & K16

8:45pm
we spotted a single
sea otter
just outside the kelp about 1/4 mile west (North) of Eagle Point. It dove and came up with a large red urchin, rolling several times before settling on its back to eat. Then a river otter charged out from the rocky shoreline and both otters disappeared. About 15 minutes later a single river otter came very fast from the west back to the rocks. We did not see the sea otter again.

7:45 a.m.
, there was another
sea otter
about 100' feet off the lighthouse at Lime Kiln Park, on its back, banging on something on its chest, did a barrel roll, and banging away again and another barrel roll. This makes almost 10 sea otter sightings in the last few weeks. Wonder if it's the same sea otter just taking a little vacation from his/her ususal hangout or will more than one be spotted at the same time one of these days...hum...
