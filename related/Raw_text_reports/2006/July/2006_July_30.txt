Orca Sightings for July 30, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cascadia Research offshore survey - Greg Schorr and I did a survey out of Westport on Sunday. The weather was beautiful, and evidently the fishing was great for everyone: there were at least 70 sportfishing boats about 10 miles out, and a number of
humpbacks
lunge feeding at the surface just a little further offshore (we identified eight individuals). In addition to the usual
harbor porpoise
and
dall's porpoise
sightings, we had a very nice encounter with about 40
Risso's Dolphins
. The group was traveling slowly, and included several young calves and one neonate- photographs revealed fetal folds visible on the animals side. Sightings of Risso's Dolphins have been infrequent off Washington, and this was our first encounter with them since we started surveying the area regularly 2 years ago, so it made Sunday especially fun.

Yards off the Hannah Heights community beach there were several
orcas
seemingly involved in mating type behavior, with much rolling around, diving together, and orca snuggling, without any visible sea snakes. To my surprise, two of the seemingly amorous whales were J2 Granny and J27 Blackberry. Was she teaching him a thing or two about a thing or two?? Who knows! When the superpod moved north to Land Bank, many of the whales spent more than an hour close in to shore, breaching, tail lobbing, spy hopping and in general, delighting me and my family from New Orleans. There was also lots of amorous behavior, with the calves bouncing around overhead. When the superpod went north, the L12's split off and came back south.
