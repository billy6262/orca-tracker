J pod
finally came south tonight and passed Land Bank at about

10:00 p.m
. I first picked them up on the radio at about
9:30 p.m. as I passed Lime Kiln. There was no vocalizing, but some slow, loud echolocation trains. After about 15 minutes they started vocalizing. I listened for about 15 minutes before I saw them. There were a number of breaches, including a couple of double breaches, lots of synchronized swimming in circles at the surface, rolling around, and a few tail slaps. We could still hear them, but couldn't see them when they finally passed.
