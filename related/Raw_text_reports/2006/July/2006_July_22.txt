Orca Sightings for July 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
4:30 PM, it was J Pod in Tumbo Channel. As the pod approached Tumbo Island westbound, a few individuals crossed the ridge in as little as 10 feet of water and entered Tumbo Channel, with more than 1/2 the pod still on the Strait of Georgia side. It wasn't long before the rest of the pod found their way around to the channel as well, and they began making their way slowly south. As was reported, the pod was in fine form, with lots of spyhops, tail slaps, some breaches and cartwheels.

A small pod of
orcas
splashed down from the north through Tumbo Channel starting around

4:15 p.m.
and finally headed out to Boundary Pass toward the south around 5 p.m. This is unusual territory for orcas in the summer but it was sure fun to see. It appeared there were about 15 whales but they were too far out from shore to identify. There was a great deal of spy hopping and fin flapping.
