Orca Sightings for July 23, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was with my family last night at whale watching park on San Juan Island yesterday and we saw lots of
orcas
. Many large males and even some babies swam by. An interpreter said it was members of J, K and L pods.

The
morning
had
all 3 pods
coming in from Victoria towards False Bay. The whales weren't in a hurry, and it made for a relaxing start of the day. In the
afternoon
we encountered a mixture of J's, K's, and L's north of Kellett Bluff. First a nice pass with J27 Blackberry leisurely searching the incoming flood for fish. A nice treat of having J11 and J39 mixing it up and being rambunctuous as the little guy rolled over mom's back, did a few small spyhops, but really raised the gooseflesh when he stopped, turned towards the boat, and did a beautiful, long vocalization. We were off to ourselves when L79 Skana showed up and began to forage back and forth, spinning in a tighter circle until he popped his head up and showed off his prize of a huge salmon! A few seconds later, all that was showing out of his mouth was a big tail, and the gulp! Tons of vocalizations, more belly-flop breaches, tail slaps, a few small spyhops by the youngsters.
