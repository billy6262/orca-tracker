Orca Sightings for July 2, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were very surprised to see several
Orcas
(4 or so) in Pickering Passage on the west side of Hartstene Island (north end of the island), heading south.

There were three or four
orcas
in Hammersley inlet and Oakland bay about
9 PM
. There were 2 or three smaller whales with short dorsal fins and one lage male with a tall dorsal fin drooping slightly to the right. They were heading at that time east in the channel but then turned around and headed back into Oakland bay and several of them (or one several times) leaped out of the water. There was also considerable fluke slapping.

3-4
orcas
, one male with large fin, sighted mid-channel, Case Inlet, South Puget Sound, due east of Wilson Pt., Harstine I., about N 47° 12' 16", W 122° 49' 25", moving SE towards Devil's head and Nisqually (not Dana Passage) about

8:30 pm
. Traveling, moving in south direction, arching out of water often at the same time, then under for a minute.

Between

3:30 and
4:30
there was a small pod of about 7 or 8
orca
females and juveniles which slowly came by Saturna Island. They were moving slowly east very close to shore. They headed north around Tumbo Island.

On our afternoon trip, we met up with
Orcas
near the Roberts Bank Coal Terminal. The first group we encountered were believed to be some
L pod
whales.They were spread out over quite a distance, in all directions, quite far offshore. We decided to check out the inshore whales, which turned out to be
J Pod
. Ruffles and Granny were in the lead at first, but then decided to check out a container ship being pushed to dock by two tugs. On this occasion, they did not put themselves between the ship and the dock as had been reported on a recently from WA State, but they did go quite close before coming back out of the port area. During the time we were with the whales, we observed a lot of foraging activity with some deep dives, and some great lunges at the surface. For a time, it appeared that J19 might be teaching the lunge technique to her calf, as we observed her doing this numerous times in the same vicinity, with the calf nearby. They did this for several minutes, then porpoised off side by side to join up with the rest of the pod, who by now, were definitely heading towards the Birch Bay area.

July 1/2 - Received a call Saturday evening (7/1) that a pod of
orcas
was heading into Hammersley Inlet from Pickering Passage. Last night (7/2) about
7 pm
the same pod was heading out of Hammersley Inlet back into Pickering Passage toward Hope Island. They surfaced amongst a pair of kayakers suprising them. Needless to say, they didn't get a clear count or determine sex of the animals.

J, K & L pods
called & filled our voice mail with WONDERFUL vocalizations at

7:30 pm
(we think they had a little help from Capt. Hollywood - thanks!)
*
Capt. Hollywood of Private Whale Watching called at

6:45 pm
to report
J, K & L's
having a Superpod 5 miles off Birch Bay, heading south toward Rosario, actively vocalizing.

Around

11:00 AM
, sighted 6
orcas
in north Case Inlet, east of Reach and Stretch Islands. There was one male and a calf with four females and they were heading south. I wasn't close enough to see any scars or unusual markings.

North Bay, Case Inlet

We have a view of the whole of Case Inlet as far south as Herron and Hartstine Island. This morning I was kayaking between our home and Stretch Point (the northern tip of Stretch Island) at about
ten in the morning
, when I came upon two groups of
orcas
. One was a mature animal with a less mature one close by, and four other animals were in a group about two hundred yards away. Only the mature animal had the very tall right triangle dorsal fin. He also did some tail flapping; slapping the water, and jumping out of the water with a half twist. Either six or seven seen. The location was roughly 122 degrees 49' W and 47 degrees 20' N. They were traveling South from Rocky Bay towards Herron Island. There have been a very large number of seals in the area quite recently. It is possible they were feeding on the seals. One was certainly male.

Amy from the Whale Museum also called to relay this report to us

We watched
K pod
head north past west San Juan Island near Landbank from

9:30 am -
9:50 am
, traveling at a good clip in spread out small groups. Later reports at around

10:30 am
had
K's
continuing north off north San Juan Island,
J pod
off the Pt. Roberts area heading south, &
L pod
heading north near Pt. Roberts.
