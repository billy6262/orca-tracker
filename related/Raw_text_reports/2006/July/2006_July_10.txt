Orca Sightings for July 10, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening we had
K-Pod
southbound at Lime Kiln Lighthouse from

6:30-
8:00 PM
. Individuals I identified were K7, K11, K20 and K38, K25, K14 and K36, K28 and K39. For the last several days, however, it seems only part of K-Pod has been around (about 14-16 whales). K21 and K40, along with a few others, seem to be separate, perhaps traveling with L-Pod?

Orcas
] doing the evening version of The West Side Shuffle at

6:45 PM
near Andrews Bay. Don't know if it's J's or K's that have been out here all afternoon, sun is too shimmery (that's a word, right?) to get an ID.

Capt. Hollywood of Private Whale Watching called to report
K's
off Turn Pt, Stuart Island, with
J's
nearby at a little after
4 pm
. He left a message of vocalizations.

K's
engaged in high speed foraging north past Land Bank at about
noon
, with a lot of submarining and low porpoising. J's followed about an hour later much more slowly, with the trailers just hanging out at Land Bank for about 1/2 hour. Then K's came back south and joined up with with the J's to travel north. At about
7pm
as I was heading into town, I saw orcas traveling south. I got no ID's because as I stopped to watch, a
sea otter
popped up in the path of the orcas off Lime Kiln. It stayed around as 5 orcas, including 2 sprouters, passed, then it dove down.

Cascadia Research received some sighting reports over the week-end and on Monday morning of a possible
humpback
whale (some reports were of a gray whale) in south Puget Sound. On Monday afternoon, after a fresh sighting near Johnson Point (NE of Olympia), Cascadia Biologists (John Calambokidis and Gretchen Steiger) did a survey and were able to find the animal and confirm it was a juvenile humpback whale. The animal did have several fairly fresh injuries including one made from a fairly small propeller that appeared to be from a collision with a small boat. One injury near the head appeared to be more serious but it was hard to judge the extent or degree of threat it posed to the animal.
