Orca Sightings for July 17, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our
afternoon
trip had
K Pod
just south of Sandheads, northbound. They continued past the south arm of the Fraser River, where they went in various directions, and were spread over miles. They eventually regrouped and turned back to the south. We left them heading southbound at about

4:30 PM
, once again passing the South Arm of the Fraser River. While we were in the vicinity we observed some foraging, with the whales chasing fish just below the surface, their dorsal fins slicing through the water. Lots of tail slapping going on today, much of it with whales swimming belly-up.
