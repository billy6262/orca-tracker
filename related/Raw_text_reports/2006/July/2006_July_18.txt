Orca Sightings for July 18, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just spoke with Shane. He's out on an evening tour and found a young
Gray Whale
at MacArthur Bank at about
7pm
. He said that it only looked to be 15 feet or so. No others were sighted and he was watching it for about a half hour. Poor little guy, he seems to have lost his way. Jami Nagel did get photos and she'll send them to you and/or Cascadia soon. It was a 3' chop so it was tough watching the little one.

The whales have been following a pattern of being in Active Pass and Canada in the early afternoon which has made reaching them quite difficult lately. Today we caught up with them just west of Otter Bay by North Pender Island.
J's and K's
were together with K's in the lead for the most part, with the bulk of J's behind. We saw K-26 (Lobo), J-1 (Ruffles), K-28 (Raven) with the new calf. We also saw K-40 (Raggedy) hanging very close to J-26 (Mike). We did see another mother with an older calf cruising along, and the calf was breaching about 4-6 times while cruising along with mom. They continued north and hit Active Pass around

3:30 - 4pm
. Our second trip, we heard that J's split from the K's and the J's continued to the Fraser River, While the K's went East towards Point Roberts.

This morning at

10:00a.m
. as
K Pod
was approaching Lime Kiln Lighthouse from the south (and with at least Blackberry J-27 mixed in with them) there was a
sea otter
about 20 feet off the kelp! This is the third sighting by the lighthouse in the last few weeks... then I got so involved in watching Sequim (K-12) - grandmother to new calf K-39 - as she traveled along with Raven (K-28) and calf K-39.
