Orca Sightings for July 6, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
(Mr. Ruffles and his gang) went through Active Pass at
4 pm
this afternoon, heading east. Some tail slapping, fin slaps, and a spy hop. Moving quite quickly and somewhat spread out.

So far, the best way to sum up the behaviors of the
orcas
this summer would be "just when you think you see a pattern, the whales go and change it". Today we had J's & K's heading up San Juan Island all afternoon, but just before we got on scene, the whales decided to do a split, with J's continuing north past Turn Point and up Swanson Channel. K's in the meantime decided to speed swim back down San Juan Island. We had a wonderful viewing of K28 Raven with her new little guy K39. K39 was speed swimming with mom, coming completely out of the water every time! Also traveling nearby were K12 and K22. They continued traveling down Stuart Island towards Battleship Island doing about 8-9 knots. At one point, K39 was about 200 yards behind mom, and was vocalizing like crazy as he went by the boat (I can only imagine he was probably asking mom to slow down!) As he continued to porpoise after mom, you'd see this little flash of black and peach come up.

J's
were milling at False Bay at
9 am
, then headed north slowly. The trailing half of the pod came in very tight to shore at Land Bank and Lime Kiln for a great look. At Land Bank some appeared to be chasing prey into the rocks, while the calves cavorted. K pod quickly came down the west side this afternoon from about
4 to 5 pm
.
