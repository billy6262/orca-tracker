Orca Sightings for February 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
(Feb. 6 & 7) Once again, we've spotted spouts in crescent bay and off tongue pt west of port angeles while surfing in the area on Monday and Tuesday. We didn't see the actual whale, but figure it's a grey that's been spotted in the area over the past year or so. On Monday evening around dusk and an outgoing tide, I noticed the spouts rather close to the beach and surf zone, in about 4-6' of water.
