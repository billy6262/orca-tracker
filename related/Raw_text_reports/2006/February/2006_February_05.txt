Orca Sightings for February 5, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
A pod of orcas was sighted from the
10:40 ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge. The sighting was around

11:00
. The whales were south of the ferry, probably initially travelling north (perpendicular to the ferry path), but traveling east, then northeast when I saw them, then north as they went around the stern of the ferry. They were about 400-600 yds from the ferry. They were over halfway across Puget Sound, closer to Bainbridge. There was a small skiff, probably fishing, not moving, which the whales surfaced very close to as they passed by. I didn't get a good look at the group, but there seemed to be at least 6-8 animals, including an adult male. They didn't seem to be feeding or playing, just traveling, surfacing relatively frequently (less than 30-60 seconds underwater). I wasn't close enough to see any markings or ID.

Fred Felleman saw the pod of
orcas
heading south from his home in Ballard at around

2:00 pm
, then saw them heading north at around
2:30 pm. He saw at least 10, & observed some whales with open saddle patches, which could indicate it might be J pod, but no ID's were confirmed.

Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called to relay a report from Chris Sly of Bainbridge Island, of a large pod of
orcas
heading north past Bainbridge at

11:45 am
. They seemed to think they were transients, but we have not yet had the ID's of these whales confirmed.
