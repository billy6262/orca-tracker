Orca Sightings for February 11, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were camped on Portland Island on Saturday night and heard what sounded like a large group of
orcas
cruising by between Portland Island and Saltspring, BC probably around
9pm
or so. It was difficult to tell which direction they were travelling though, and obviously we couldn't see anything.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to relay a report of a large group of
transients
at Constance Bank at

11:30 am
, inbound. He updated the report later in the day to say he sighted ~30 Transients off Kelp Reef at
1 pm
heading north up Haro Strait, and at 5 pm they were heading up Swanson Channel.

Here's a brief rundown on the day. Mark Malleson first spotted a large group of
transients
from shore heading east off Constance Bank in the
late morning
(I am without my logbook so my times are kinda general). After an epic search, the whales were finally found again (by Ken flying and by Radar) traveling north in Haro Strait
midafternoon
. When I (finally) arrived on scene, Mark had a large tight group that included T87, T88, T94, and T97 plus several others. Once Mark takes a look at his pictures, he can add more whales. There were several spread out groups about a mile ahead so I headed for those guys. These groups included T14, T20, T30, T40 (the old T2-The Terminator), the T71's(!), T90, the T100's, the T101's, the T124A's(!), T85 and calf, plus 4 or 5 others. I never got on Mark's group but I counted at least 25 whales in my pictures alone so we're talking about probably 35 or more transients today which is even more than our field estimates. The leaders were traveling sort of business like but I saw at least one session of milling just south of Moresby Island with lots of gulls diving so they got something there. Also, T124A appears to have a new calf as does T100. So-the Hood Canal whales (the last batch) have finally showed up again! I left the leaders heading north in Swanson Channel around
1630ish
.

(note: These are the "Slippery Six" from Hood Canal 2005: T71, T71A and T71B, T124A , T124A1 and T124A2....& with T124A's new calf, now the Slippery Seven!)

My partial list has, T14, T20's, T40, T87, T88, T93, T97, T100's and more, hope to have more later. All off Victoria this morning (
1130
).

I spotted a large group of T's (
Transient
orcas) off Victoria's waterfront this morning at
1100
moving quickly for Discovery Island. Finally got contact with them at
1530
east of Sidney Island headed north up Haro. I left Dave Ellifrit (Centre for Whale Research) with them at
1600
.

Prince of Whales Whale Watching We heard from Mallard Mark about
transients
heading up Haro Strait. Mark helped us locate them at Mandarti Island. There must have been over twenty, including Capt Hook who hadn't been seen since 1997!!! Weather was slightly overcast, but very calm. Saw lots of bald eagles and a group of harbor seals hanging out in New Channel by Spieden. There were a lot of Stellars in Spieden Channel on the way back. The transients were at Gooch, heading North when we left them. (

Deer Harbor Charters WOW!! ON OUR TRIP YESTERDAY WE HAD 25 PLUS
TRANSIENT
ORCAS OFF OF SIDNEY ISLAND TRAVELING VERY QUICKLY NORTH TOWARDS MORESBY ISLAND (WESTERN HARO STRAIT). WHAT A SIGHT, WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A FEW COMMONLY SEEN TRANSIENT PODS IN THE GROUP BUT THE MOST INTERESTING SIGHTING WAS THE SIGHTING OF A TRANSIENT CALLED CAPTAIN HOOK, AN OLD MALE WITH A MANGLED DORSAL FIN. HE WAS TRAVELING AMONG THIS LARGE GROUP OFF BY HIMSELF, MIXED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUP. THERE WERE QUITE A FEW VERY YOUNG WHALES AS WELL. INTERESTINGLY, WE DIDN'T SEE A HARBOR SEAL OR PORPOISE WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THE TRANSIENTS. IT'S UNUSUAL TO TRAVEL THROUGH THAT AREA AND NOT SEE ANY. ALONG WITH THE TRANSIENTS WE SAW OVER 30 STELLER SEA LIONS ON OUR WAY HOME NEAR SPIEDEN ISLAND.

I have to add an interesting report from Tom McMillen, though it's not of whales......yesterday, Feb. 11 in Puget Sound he saw a tug pulling a log boom, & on top of the logs were MANY (hundreds?) seals taking a ride! I thought this was pretty funny, & now with the reports of so many transients in the area, I wondered if they jumped onboard to take a safe ride far away from them?!

We received a call from Osh at California's Salt Pt. State Park (north of San Francisco) reporting 25 - 30 orcas heading north off the park yesterday, Feb. 11th. They were in 3 groups, from 100 yards to 1/2 mile offshore. There were also gray whales in the same area at the time.
