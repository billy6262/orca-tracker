Orca Sightings for February 12, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I forgot to mention that the
T41's
appeared this afternoon near Pedder Bay (Jeff Lamarche found them on his way to Race Rocks). I left them at
1600
entering Race Rocks on a west bound heading. Mark Malleson

Have whales going East from Secretary Is. just West of Sooke at
1416
. 2047 update: The inbound whales are a number of the
transients
from yesterday. At least 3 whales off Albert Head South of Victoria going towards Race Rocks at
1455
. Most of yesterdays transients were there but no T14 and T40. These had been replaced by the T2's, all in bound from Sooke. The whales South of Victoria were the T41's, it seems these whales were east of Clover Pt. (Victoria waterfront) at
0930
.
