Orca Sightings for June 25, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

11:45
, we heard on the radio that
J-Pod
had decided to really move across Georgia Strait and was making a beeline for Eastpoint at about 10 knots. So we headed up Boundary and found them about 1 mile east of Eastpoint, and boy were they in a mood to play! Multiple breaches, spyhops, and probably the most amazing cartwheel I've ever seen (so energetic the whale came completely out of the water!) For the afternoon trip, J's were still in Boundary Pass, having slowed up considerably. As they made the turn at Turn Point, the whales got quite frisky again as they entered the "washing machine" of converging currents and went into multiple breach mode once again. And it appears that L-57 is still hanging out with the J's as he was the only L-Pod whale we observed.

We watched a pod of 6-8
Transients
off Race Rocks and heading North past Victoria this mid morning. There was one large male I have a temporary ID as T11A but will confirm after I send my photo to the Center later in the week. There were several females and or young males and one baby that looked like it was about a year or so old. At one point they were all grouped up and traveling tight â€“ easily doing about 7-8 knots! Earlier reports were 8 whales and I have a photo that you can clearly ID 6 dorsals.
