J Pod
was very active in Rosario. They were headed south until around 3 or so when they decided to head back up north instead of buck the strong current. J1 actually cartwheeled twice nearby and in the midst of it all J2 breached alongside him! We got a really good look at J19 and her baby J41. Comparing the picture to an early one last year, J41 looks really good- she's grown a lot and is not very orange at all anymore.

Spent the day with
J pod
in Rosario Strait. In the morning they were very active, physically and vocally: lots of breaching and tumbling and the like. We met them near Tide Pt., where they were headed southbound. We got a good view of (I think) Granny and Riptide playing with the two calves, J40 and J41. Lots of barrel rolls, sommersaults, etc. We rejoined them in the
afternoon
near Pt. Lawrence, as they had turned and headed back to the north. They were in a tight resting pattern, close to shore. As they came around the point they made a turn east across the Strait, and over the next half hour became slightly more awake, beginning to break into two groups mid-channel before we left.

Gray
whales have been feeding, off the kelp bed, east of Chito Point. This has been amazing in the last few weeks. We have had more Gray whale sightings than ever before, mainly concentrated in one area, for longer periods, more than once a day.
