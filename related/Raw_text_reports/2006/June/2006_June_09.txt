Orca Sightings for June 9, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
In Otter Bay, Pender Island, Ruffles and Granny surfaced right in front of us! They were traveling north and as we sat outside Otter Bay, eventually all of
J-Pod
passed us headed north along Pender Island between

6:00 and
7:00 p.m
. The whales were fairly spread out and grouped up, so it took the better part of an hour for the whole family to pass us. There was a lot of breaching at Mouat Point....then fast traveling up island, with J-26 doing a nice back float past the dinghy.

J Pod
came by around noon, heading north (west side San Juan Isl). I was surprised to see another group of whales porpoising by in fast mode also heading north around
3 PM
. Turns out it was J-27 and gang--I heard they were down around Cattle Pass while the main group was several miles ahead of them.
