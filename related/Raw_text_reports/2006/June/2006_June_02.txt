pod sighted at Point Roberts WA

6:30 -
7:00 pm
- approx 7 whales, 2 large dorsal fin males, One calf (with female) heading South. Feeding behaviour, harbour seals were close to shore and away from the orcas, so whales were probably feeding on salmon/other fish as the smelt are running. There was another whale blow, perhaps a Gray, heading North.
