Orca Sightings for June 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Springer's back! The
A11s
, inclusive of A73/Springer returned to Johnstone Strait today. Reported by Stubbs Island Whale Watching.
*
Karl at Alki Pt. reported the pod of
orcas
heading south past the south edge of Alki Pt. heading toward Lincoln Park
between
9:10 &
9:30 pm
. 1 male, 4 females & 1 juvenile.
*
Josh Gillanders on the Goodtime 2/Argossy Cruises called to report the pod of
orcas
at a little after
8 pm
. They had been sighted by 2 of the Argossy boats off Westpoint & the Tango Buoy NW of Alki Pt, still heading south. More details from Washington State Ferries about the pod were that 1 adult male & a calf were present in the pod.
*
It was Big Dorsal day on the West side (San Juan Isl) with
J’s & L’s
swimming together. First encounter was up just South of Lime Kiln at about
2PM
. The whales heading North went by. About a half an hour later I looked up and the whales that had passed by earlier were headed South again! As usual, Ruffles & Granny seemed to be the leaders. As I continued North I looked back and here came L57 with two females, one on each side heading North again! It was amazing- whales back and forth heading every which way. Some were foraging off shore and some just seemed to be milling. There were a couple of tail slaps and one female breached twice! It was just fabulous, with a calm glassy Haro Straight and sunshine to boot!!!
