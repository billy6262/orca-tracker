Orca Sightings for June 3, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Rod Johnson, a commercial fisherman out of Newport,
OR
, reported a pod of
orcas
approx. 10 miles off of Newport. The pod included 1 male plus 2 - 3 others - sounds like the same pod of Transients we've been hearing about lately. They were playing with a seal, he said it looked like they were teaching the young ones how to hunt.

I was out with
J Pod
at about

3:30pm
off of Turn Point. They were broken up in several small groups with 3-5 members per group and they were heading north. A younger animal turned upside down and gave us some nice looks at his pec fins and then started to slap his tail while upside down with his pecs sticking out.. very cute!
