Orca Sightings for June 18, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We met up with
J-Pod
about 1.5 miles off shore of False Bay. J-1 was leading the pack towards Salmon Bank, with most of the J's spread out over a large distance. We were fortunate to see quite a few juveniles practicing their breaches, and had the rare treat of two spyhops back to back (my favorite whale behavior)! Lots of evidence of foraging going on. Later, I noticed J's going by Low Island/San Juan County Park heading North. They were still traveling semi-spread, except for one tight group of 9 whales that was traveling in a quite slow pace.
