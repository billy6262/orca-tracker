There were
Orcas
off the south end of Lopez (Hughes Bay) starting at about
6pm
. I think it was J-pod (I thought I spotted J1) plus another pod but I am not sure, there were a few adult males. They were lingering off the bay for a few hours, and there seemed to be a lot of body contact and playing happening.

K-Pod
decided to throw the "normal" routes out the window and traveled North via Speiden Channel, President's Channel and then headed northward past Patos Island. Part of J-Pod was just passing Pea Pods towards Cypress Island. Very spread out across the entire width of Rosario Channel. Rumors of the rest of J-Pod as far ahead as Hannah Heights came in over the radio around
3:30 PM.

We received a call from the Puyallup ferry, reporting 4
orcas
near Apple Tree Cove in the south bound shipping lanes at

1:40 pm
. 1 male and 3 smaller orcas were reported.
*
We found
K Pod
this morning at

10:15
heading east in Spieden Channel. They were in several groups, one group swimming the shore of Spieden, and a larger group, with K-21, staying on the south side of the channel. The whales spent their time traveling, doing some foraging, a few tail slaps, breaches, and one grand spy hop. They went toward Jones Island, then Orcas, doing some long dives, and finally making the decision to head on to the east. The new baby was very energetic, with lots of fast swimming by mom. There were several other fins that looked a lot like sprouters!

Beginning at about

7:15 am, k pod
slowly made it's way up the west side of San Juan Island, trailed by the sprouters. It was interesting to watch the trailers, who lolled on top of the water for about 10 minutes- double breached and then headed south.
