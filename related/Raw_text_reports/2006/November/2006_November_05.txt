Orca Sightings for November 5, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw two
orcas
from the park just north of the ferry dock (I believe this is called Bracket’s Landing) in Edmonds at about
5pm
. They were quite far out but we were there to look at birds and had a powerful spotting scope. One of the orcas had a huge dorsal fin, very tall and thin. They were making their way south. We lost sight of them once they passed behind the ferry dock.

The
Orcas
passed our home, mid-way between Langley and Clinton, about

11:30 am
. They were spread out across the bay, heading south. There appeared to be up to 20.

It was wonderful to wake up at about

10:00am
to seeing
Orcas
!! There was a pod of about 15 that we saw from our high bank house at Whidbey Shores (East Point) overlooking Saratoga Passage. They were traveling South towards Langley and seemed to be both traveling and playing (some breaching). There was one large male.

My family just saw quite a few
Orcas
between our house (Whitehorse Lane) and Hat Island (

11:30 AM
). I believe there were at least 12 of them ,one seemed very small. We were so excited we quit counting and just watched them.

At about

10:45 a.m
., my husband and I saw a pod of
Orcas
in the Saratoga Passage, swimming Southeast, toward Hat Island. Our house is located about a mile Southeast of Langley - a little North of Sandy Point, facing Camano Head. We saw at least 6 Orcas, including at least one male – larger with big fin – and a couple of smaller Orcas, perhaps calves?
