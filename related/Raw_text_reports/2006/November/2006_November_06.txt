Orca Sightings for November 6, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just talked to Kenny Rich, who lives kitty-cornered from me. He said he watched some
orcas
for about 30 minutes this
afternoon
. They were right off Bush Point, between the point and center channel, feeding on chum salmonâ€”so going every which way. He saw 1 adult male for sure and perhaps another. Hard to tell how many in total.
