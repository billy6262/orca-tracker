Orca Sightings for November 4, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We observed at least four
orcas
slowly swimming north towards Pebble Beach (SW Camano Island) this afternoon at

4:15
. They, fortunately for us, didn't seem to be in much of a hurry.

We just returned from watching the
orcas
heading south off Sandy Point (so. of Langley, Whidbey Isl) then east into the mist off the north end of Hat Island -- maybe the same pod traveling north along Camano turned south?

Barbara Anderson of Camano Island called at
1 pm
to report a pod of
orcas
heading north past Pebble Beach, SW Camano Island, close to the Camano shore.
