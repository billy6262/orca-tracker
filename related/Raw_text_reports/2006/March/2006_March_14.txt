Orca Sightings for March 14, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had a page and several calls inquiring about [
orcas
] spotted at Kelp Reef heading South around
1 PM
.
John Boyd (JB)
Marine Naturalist, Friday Harbor
*
Windwalker Taibi of East Pt. Whidbey Island, called to report one
gray
whale in Saratoga Passage between East Pt. & Camano Island Park at
2 pm
.
*
Finally - I get to give my first
gray
whale report of the season! After receiving Windwalker's & Toms' calls (see reports below) I went out to the bluff & found the gray whale NW of East Pt, heading toward Baby Island at ~

2:15 pm
. I watched as it continued toward Baby Island spouting & diving, then after walking my impatient puppy around the block, found it again at
2:45 pm, this time NW of Baby Island, diving & spouting with no clear direction, but possibly heading across the entrance to Holmes Harbor toward North Bluff/Greenbank.
*
Tom McMillen of Island Adventures/Salish Sea Charters called to report a
gray
whale (looked like Patch) in Saratoga Passage, heading toward Baby Island & the entrance to Holmes Harbor, just NW of East Pt, a little after
2 pm
. Tom also reported that Cascadia ID'd three different gray whales so far during the past few outings: #22, #49 (Patch) & #56.
