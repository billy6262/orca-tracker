============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom Paul of Kayak Pt, Port Susan called to report 2
grays
at approx.
11 am
.
*
3
grays
in the
afternoon
in saratoga passage.
Dodie on Camano
*
At
6 pm
I looked out the window & saw three [
gray
] whale spouts in Saratoga Passage, closer to the Camano side south of Elger Bay. The spouts were close together in quick succession - my guess is the mother & calf pair, with the calf taking 2 quick breaths or possibly a third whale close by. I watched as they traveled north & saw spouts a few more times.

There are two
gray
whales traveling northwest, near Camano, opposite Langley at

4:10 pm
. Through the binoculars one whale’s “breathing plume” and fluke look smaller than the other. Maybe a mother and calf?
