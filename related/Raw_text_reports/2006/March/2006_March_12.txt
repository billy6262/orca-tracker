Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters/Island Adventures called to report two

Paul at Great Bend Charters called to report seeing several spouts of a lone
gray
whale at
2 pm
in Hood Canal, on the Kitsap side near Chinom Pt.
*
We saw an (
gray
)? around

1:05
. There seemed to be only one. Had a very large tail but to small for a gray whale?. It was spotted on the Port Townsend and Keystone ferry. ... seemed to be hunting in a area. We didn't see a fin but we saw the tale of it. I haven't seen any whales in the area but have heard of all the whales on the ferry ride.

My guess is this was more likely a gray whale, since only the tail was seen, & no fin - also, there was a report of a gray at Bush Pt. 2 hours later, which could place a gray in this area at 1 pm - sb

Kerry White called to report 3 or 4
orcas
heading north 1/2 mile out, from N. Sonoma, CA almost to Mendocino County, at
2 pm
. He believed there may have been a gray whale in the area as well.
