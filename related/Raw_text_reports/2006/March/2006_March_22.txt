Orca Sightings for March 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters called to report a
gray
whale east of Camano Head at 2 pm, & 2 other grays off Race Lagoon at around
4 pm
.
*
This morning at

5:30a.m
. a
gray
whale on the tide flats at Mabana Shores Camano feeding on ghost shrimp. Stayed in the area of the flats for approximately l hour. So far this season we have no whale feeding pits....I think things are about to change. In past years we would have had dozens and dozens of pits exposed at minus tides, by this time of year.
