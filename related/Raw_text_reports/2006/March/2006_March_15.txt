Orca Sightings for March 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I left
Jpod
at
1730
headed west a mile south of Race Rocks. J19 & J40, J27, J22 & J38, J35, J34 were positively ID'd. They were very spread out and feeding doing some long dives. They were probably all in the area as I was seeing blows a few miles north of Port Angeles.

Spotted
orcas
today from the Race Rocks webcam travelling on the East side of Race Rocks and then between RR and Port Angeles between
4 pm and 4.15
or so your time - gone midnight here in UK !!!. Too distant to get decent picture but looked like two or three whales. At one point there was a huge splash in the water as if a whale had breeched.
