Orca Sightings for March 28, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
5pm
Two
Greys
just north of Sandy Point, could see the blows from 1st street, and went to Sandy Point to check them out. They were feeding, I got a few good shots. There was a few tale flaps and what looked to be a spy hop. They stayed there for about an hour and then swam toward Camano Island. This is the third time this week that I have seen greys in this area.
