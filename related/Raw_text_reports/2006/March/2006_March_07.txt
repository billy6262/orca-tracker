Orca Sightings for March 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bruce Bardwell of Coupeville called in a report of a large pod of
orcas
Tuesday night
between 5 &
5:30 pm
, near Race Lagoon (east of Coupeville, near the entrance to Penn Cove). There were at least 15 whales, spread out, with one small pod of 6 whales traveling in a tight bunch close to shore. They were heading SE, past Shangri La shores. A neighbor saw the whales again at 7 pm, and they were heading NW at that time.

Just wanted to report that we heard at least two to three
gray's
off the west side of Camano Island tonight at

11:45pm
, close to shore just off Madrona beach heading north up Saratoga passage. I couldn't spot them (since it was dark) but given the frequency of them surfacing and the noise they were making, I'm sure they were grays.

Betty Schneider called from the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry at

9:35 am
, reporting a pod of ~20
orcas
- they were in front of the ferry (it had to stop to let them go by!), porpoising north toward Hat Island.
