Orca Sightings for December 3, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was watching what looked like
J's
travelling west near Trial Island at approximately
1600hrs
today. I'm assuming that the animals south Race Rocks were some of the K's and/or L's. At
1430
a friend of mine spotted killer whales east bound north of Race Rocks. I get the feeling that they were spread out all around the area. It seems as though the winter chinook feeding around here is good right now with the first 3 days of December having KW's in the area. Ron and I were discussing the possibility that the ones on Friday may have been residents instead of the suspected T's. I got a late report today from a friend of mine who saw what he thought were residents near Race Rocks on Friday evening while he was out fishing.

] off Race Rocks at
1403
but South of Race. At
1450
I have a report off 2
Humpbacks
just South of Victoria not to far S. of the V.H. buoy (about 2.5 miles).
Residents
off William Head about 8 miles S. of Vic. going East. Both of these reports put whales North of Race Rocks. At
1612
whales (
res
) going west from Trial Is. J1 in the rear. Fading light but 20+ . There were still a number of whales off Victoria today, no matter who or what.
