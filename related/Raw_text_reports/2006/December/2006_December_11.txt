Orca Sightings for December 11, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

1:04pm
two (possibly three)
orcas
passed in front of the Bremerton to Seattle Ferry (port to starboard, heading south). They then could be seen passing in front of a towboat following us starboard. At their nearest point they were no more than 150 to 200 yards from the ferry. When we encountered them it seemed to me that we were almost halfway between Alki Point Lighthouse and Bainbridge Island. The orcas were headed in the direction of Blake Island.
