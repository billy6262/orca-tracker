Orca Sightings for December 5, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries updated their report of the
orcas
off Kingston & S. Whidbey - they ID'd L12 sub-pod whales along with K pod. They were able to collect a fish scale sample from a feeding event, to help determine what they are eating out there.

Apparently it was the
K Pod
that was putting on a great show about
1 PM
as we took the Edmunds Ferry to Kingston. One orca breached. Both ferries slowed and the whales hung out in the space between them (1000 yards? Probably less). Thanks to the captain who alerted the whole ferry and slowed to give the passengers a show for a short while.
