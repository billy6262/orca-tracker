Orca Sightings for December 31, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We sighted a
dead
whale, I believe a
gray
whale, near the middle of Hood Canal east of Triton Cove. The whale was about 20 feet long floating on it’s side. We reported the sighting to Wa’ Fish & Wildlife. Jan. 1 Update: As of Sunday night it was still drifting, last report was off Quatsup Point at about
2:30 pm Sunday afternoon. We’re having some southerly wind today so I expect the whale is drifting north towards Dabob Bay or the Hood Canal Bridge unless it beaches itself.

Between
1400 and 1700h
biologists of the Farallones observed a pod of 8
orca
near Southeast Farallon Island, California (37°42’ N 123°00’W). There were 2 obvious males (1 taller and thinner with a slight bend at the tip, the other with a shorter wider male dorsal fin), 3 females (1 considerably larger than the others), and 2 juveniles (1 larger than the other), and a final large individual with either a stub of a dorsal fin, or the fin was bent over completely resembling a stub-fin. The pod swam back and forth near the west shore of the island in 2 groups. 1 group was females and juveniles, often swimming in a chorus line, the other group was the 2 males and the stub-fin individual circling about 200m away from group 1. Several individuals were seen tail-throwing, spy-hopping and rolling over. We see orcas here periodically throughout the year.
