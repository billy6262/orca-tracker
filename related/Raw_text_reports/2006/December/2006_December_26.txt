Orca Sightings for December 26, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

10:00 AM
we had a (I believe)
Gray
swam by about 50 yards off shore from Lagoon Point this morning headed south. He was so close at first glance I though it was a submarine in the front yard. It surfaced once near the canal entrance and they blew once down at the south point of Lagoon Point and was gone.
