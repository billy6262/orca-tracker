Orca Sightings for December 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Reports from Annie Stateler, published in
The Loop
have the [
orcas
] in colvos passage at

9:00 am
, heading north widely dispersed. Hyrdophone recording confirmed K's and L's ( L12 members with Kpod).
*
We received a call from a Southworth resident reporting a pod of about 12
orcas
in Colvos Passage at Pt. Southworth, heading NW toward the west side of Blake Island at
10 am
.
*
I was fortunate enough to observe a pod of about 6 to 7
Orcas
this morning (

6:30
) in Colvos Passage in Gig Harbor while watching the sun come up. I saw one male for sure and what looked like a couple of very smaller ones. I was hoping for a little playful action but they pretty much stayed on course heading up through the passage, between Gig Harbor and Vashon Island, towards Seattle.
