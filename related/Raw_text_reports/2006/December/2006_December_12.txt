Orca Sightings for December 12, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Elsa Leavitt called at
2 pm
to report many
orcas
just south of Bush Pt, Whidbey Island, heading north at 2 pm. She saw a calf and an adult male, & a group of 4 females traveling in a tight line, along with others.
*
I headed over to the west side when I received Elsa's call, & finding nothing at Bush Pt (except a frustrated Elsa!), we both headed north to Lagoon Pt. At
3 pm
, we finally spotted the
orcas
again - they had traveled north & were approaching the ferry lanes between Port Townsend & Admiralty Head. They were still heading north, but there were some direction changes, milling & feeding behaviors. I headed north, & watched from

3:30 -
3:50 pm as the orcas approached Indian Island & Port Townsend. I counted 10 - 12+ orcas present, including at least one adult mael. A calf breached several times, & there was more feeding behavior & lunges in all directions, but they were consistently heading NW when I left them at about
3:50.
