Orca Sightings for January 15, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jan. 14/15?? We received a message today from Elaine Wiley, who lives north of Ayok Pt. in Hood Canal. They had been out of town for a week, but today heard from a neighbor that his brother-in-law saw
orcas
from his house last weekend (Jan. 14/15?), putting on quite a show. This is third or fourth hand & not verified or confirmed, but given there was a pod off Whidbey on Sunday & Monday, & transients seen & heard in Haro Strait & Race Rocks the 17th/18th, it's possible they could've popped into the canal in the early part of the weekend.

Today while surfing at Crescent Beach west of Port Angeles, we saw spouts just to the left of Tongue Point during the rising tide. We figured it was a
grey
as we saw one there this time last year. Thanks!

Around
1 p.m.
, my husband and I received a call from our neighbor who said that about 15
orcas
had just gone by our houses (Langley, Whidbey Isl). He didn't think we were home so hadn't called when they were directly in front of our place. He said they were heading north and we may still be able to see them. We couldn't see them from our house so we hopped in our car and headed to Langley where we were able to observe them between Langely and Camano Island heading north. They stayed in one area closer to Camano than Langely for a bit before heading north again. There were males in the group, but not sure how many. Noticed there were two seperate groups and it appeared a mother and youngster.
