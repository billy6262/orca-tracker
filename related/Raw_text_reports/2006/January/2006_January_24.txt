pilot whales

dolphins
, numerous sea turtles, many sailfish jumping, and a crocodile in the Seripe River, off the north part of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica.

Received a call at
9 am
this morning from a Bill Arana, reporting a pod of 4 - 6
orcas
off the Calif. coast (live - I could hear them surface & spout on the message!). There was a group of a female & 2 young ones, plus a large male, & they were out at N 38 56.5 W 123 45.3, east of Plantation, between Horseshoe & Salt Pts. He also reported there were lots of
gray
whales around as well, so I am assuming it is transients again...
