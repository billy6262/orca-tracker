============================================================

Entry 1:
6:00pm
- Spotted one
grey
feeding with fin and tail flukes showing in the shallows just west of Jetty Island. Saw it and the spout of a second head toward Hat /Gedney Island. Not close enough to I.D.

At

7:25 PM
, heading back around Possession point towards the ferry and back home to snug Langley Marina after a wonderful Birthday cruise, we observed two
gray
whales feeding North of Possession Beach. The sun was setting to light-up their flukes and spray but made it difficult to identify them. And just as we turned to say goodbye, we plowed right into a large pod of what looked like Dalls feeding in fast formation thru the boiling current and headed right for our little boat!

Tom McMillen called in a report at

2:30 pm
of four
grays
in Saratoga Passage. Two of them, #21 and #22, were just off the East side of Gedney Island, and two more were in mid-channel, heading north toward Camano Island.

A trio of
gray
whales began feeding eagerly at the high tide shortly before
5am
this morning. Almost an hour later and they're still here - up at the west end of First Street in Langley. Their breathing seems especially robust in the quiet of first light. In the distance a sea lion barks. It's now after six and they're STILL here! (but looks like they're headed east toward downtown Langley)

Observed a large
gray
just at drop-off at Mabana Shores, at

6:45 am
. The whale was feeding. I cannot explain why these creatures are not coming in over the tide flats. In the past 20 or so years I have been observing grays we have had hundreds of feeding pits exposed at minus tides. This is the first year they have not used the flats for feeding. I wish John C. could explain this behavior. They stay at the drop-off and travel parallel to the beach. After feeding for half an hour the whale moved on to the middle of the passage traveling north. They come to the sound to feed on their migration, then why have their habits changed on this particular journey?
