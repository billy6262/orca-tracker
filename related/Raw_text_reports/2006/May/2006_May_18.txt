I was out today North east of Turn Point [the eastern tip of Stuart Island, just north of San Juan Island]. and we had one main family group [
orcas
] by us, while the rest of the pod were still south... J-14, J-30, J-37, and J-40 were all together, zig zagging around that whole area. They did serveral long dives, and eventually headed south with the rest of the pod. We saw a few tail lobs while hanging with them.
