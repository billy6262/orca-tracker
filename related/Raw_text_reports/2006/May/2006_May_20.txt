Orca Sightings for May 20, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters reported
gray
whale #22 off Gedney/Hat Island around
1 pm
, with a new scrape/injury on its back. He saw the same whale Thursday with no injury. Photos were taken & sent to Cascadia Research & National Marine Fisheries Service.
*
1830
. While walking along north Chesterman Beach near Tofino, Vancouver Island, I saw a blow and mottled back of a juvenile
gray
whale. The animal was approximately 50 meters off-shore circling a small islet in a counter clock-wise direction. After surfacing a number of times in a relatively short duration, I heard another breath (
1845
) while the gray was submerged. The quick exhalation and powerful intake sounded different from the first animal I observed. Suddenly a large black triangular fin followed in the same orbiting path as the juvenile gray. I watched a single adult male
orca
surface three times, then expose a side and right pectoral fin. The orca then dove and was not observed again. I continued my walk and finally heard the gray again, still circling the rocky outcropping, and apparently without injury.

As the last vessel on scene last night with
J-pod
, I thought I'd send in the report. we had j-pod all bunched together, resting, slowly moving north from Hannah Heights towards Lime Kiln, San Juan. We departed the scene around
8.45pm
.

Met up with
J's
in Haro Strait off of False Bay around 3pm today. They were rather spread out, heading east. A few leaps from one whale.
