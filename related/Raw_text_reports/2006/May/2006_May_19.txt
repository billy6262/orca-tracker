Some
J's
off of the Peapods in Rosario this

Amanda Hogan saw a
Minke
whale off Vashon Island at

1:18 pm
, westbound in Colvos Passage.
*
Today started out with reports of
J's
heading south in Rosario. We eventually caught up to them near Colville seeing the occasional breach in the distance. Then all of a sudden a
Minke
whale surfaced 40 yards off our bow. To our delight the Minke whale seemed quite intrigued by us. This whale spent 15 to 20 minutes circling the Odyssey several times surfacing just 20 feet away on several occasions. This Minke had three white spots behind and to the right of its blow hole.

#723
was off Possesion Pt. feeding in the water column along with all kinds of birds,seals,sea lions,and an exceptional number of loons. Angela and i have been keeping a log all season of the grays we see and how they pair up and what the tide is doing.

A call came in from Kenbon Pelj in Bandon, Oregon, reporting about 8
orcas
, including one male, travelling north about six miles west of Bandon Harbor. They were seen at
11 AM
. He saw one breach.
*
2pm - Orcas
traveling west between Aleck Bay and Iceberg Point on Lopez – very spread out. Only half a dozen were clearly visible from shore, but more were apparently further out judging from the whale watch boats. Summer must be coming – we had at least 7 commercial whale watch boats with this pod.

My husband and I observed what we believe was a
humpback
whale heading north at

7:00 AM
in Possession Sound, between Hat Island and our home between Clinton and Langley on Whidbey Island. The large whale had a row of knobs along the top and displayed a noticeable "humpback" before diving. It lifted it's tail high into the air before diving. We often observe Gray Whales and this was distinctly different.

We were out today trying to collect prey and fecal samples from
J-pod
. We collected one sample, most likely from J41, that contains a number of bits of fish (we think J41 may have regurgitated the sample). Later in the day we had J35, J37 and J40
carrying a dead harbor porpoise
for 30+ minutes, off the west side of San Juan Island. Earlier in the day we heard radio reports of several unidentified J-pod whales "playing rugby" with a harbor porpoise - possibly it was the same individual porpoise a couple of hours later. Fascinating to see this behavior continuing over from last year, as I think prior to last year the cases of "residents" interacting in this way with porpoises was largely restricted to a few L-pod and K-pod whales.

Here are
some pictures
I took today showing an unidentified member of
J-pod playing with a porpoise
. Thought you might like to see them. I also sent the pictures to Ken in hopes he could ID the whale.

Tom McMillen was with
gray
whale #723 near Possession Pt. (south tip of Whidbey Is.) at

1:30 pm
. The whale was going in circles, apparently feeding, in fairly deep water.
