Orca Sightings for May 22, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Erin at the Center for Whale Research reported she & Dave Ellifrit were out with some of L pod - they were very spread out, but they saw L 57 & L41's group. At around 5 pm they were off Salmon Bank heading out the strait. They had a report of J pod off the Fraser River heading south.

Lpod
on the west side. Well, as you know I am usually putting out fires re a new calf. I guess this time I started it. A very young animal not new today but new this season came out of the fog and rain. Have sent in my few photos but not sure if I got anything but water spots on the lens.

How do you describe the excitment and joy you feel when you hear the news that
L-pod
is back? It's like waiting for your favorited relatives to arrive for Christmastime! Well, that's the way it feels for me anyway. The day was a spring mist type of day. The air was full of gentle small drops that soaked and caressed you at the same time. As we left the dock, the waters were calm and sprinkeled with rain drops. As we approached Cattle Pass, the fog began to roll off San Juan Island. L's were spread out off Eagle Point, but no one could see that far. At first, the visibility was about a half mile, but then it closed in. Ocean Magic let me know where he was and that they were vocalizing on the surface. We headed for his position and the fog cleared for about a quarter of mile and we saw our first fins! Mega was fishing with a few females!!!! You go lad! Shortly thereafter, the fog sighed and disappeared. L's were spread out about a mile or two offshore foraging. Looked like they were finding some good feeding. We moved off to another male and some mom's with youngsters then our time ran out.

Met a medley of whales west of Eagle Pt. this morning. We identified
L57
and one of the L calves (the name escapes me). Some
J pod
whales were also present. They were fairly spread out, so I'm not sure if the entire pods were present. Plenty of play activity, as well as a bit of mating. At least 10 Dall's porpoise were also present in the same area. On the way back to PT (around

3:30pm
) we met a lone
transient
a mile west of Smith Island, heading north.
