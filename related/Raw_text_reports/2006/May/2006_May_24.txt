Orca Sightings for May 24, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We came upon
J Pod
, as they headed around the southern tip of Lopez at approximately
1300
hours. They were fairly spread out, all heading up past Cattle Pass and up the west side of San Juan Island. Ruffles came toward the end of the group, sliding by with a nice show of his dorsal, along with J-2, Granny, and J-8 Spieden. Later, when we thought almost everyone must be by, J-11, Blossom and her crew came through the waves, now beginning to build to 2-3 footers. Blossom had one youngster on either side of her, and then J-27 cruising along beside the group. They were still heading north at 1400 hours when we turned to head back into Cattle Pass.

My dad called me at work at

11:00 am
to report 15-20
orcas
in the front yard, actually at Williamson rocks. Raced out to the house and sure enough my six year old was busy trying to ID ruffles through the telescope, pretty cool!

I spotted
Ruffles J-1
heading towards Lime Kiln. Soon I was joined by Sharon Grace and her grand daughter, as the whales stayed about 1/4 mile off shore, staying in the rips that had formed. Nice little groupings as they headed up. Figuring they were gone for the day, I was again surprised to see them turn at Kellett Bluff and come back down island. We weren't disappointed. J-26 Mike was way inshore of the other whales, about 20-30 feet from shore. I noticed J-1 Ruffles tagging along just behind him with J2 Granny nearby. J26 launched out of the water 20 feet from the shore right in front of us.
