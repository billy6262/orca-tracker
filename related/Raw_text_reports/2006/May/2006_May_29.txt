J Pod
was inside the islands today. J Pod was in San Juan Channel this
morning
and turned and headed down the West Side of San Juan this afternoon. They were very spread out. There were quite a few breaches and tail lobs in the mix.

Looks like the
J's
are still around. Heard a rumor that they were seen this morning in San Juan Channel heading south, but then turned about Brown Island (entrance to Friday Harbor) and headed back north. They must have gone through Speiden Channel, as they are now (
~3 pm
) heading south past Low Island heading for Lime Kiln.
