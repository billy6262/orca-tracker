Orca Sightings for May 27, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
J -pod
going south in Rosario at
noon
and after. They were very spread out this afternoon, and seemed to decide to head over toward Whidbey Island. Very "relaxed" swimming and behavior. On our evening trip, we found that the pod had turned west and north and we found them on the south end of Lopez at
6 p.m
. They were still spread out traveling with a few miles in between the leaders and those bringing up the rear. They were more grouped into their sub family pods by this time, but still, relaxed traveling. J-26 did some nice cartwheels, and then swimming on his back, with peck fins up in the air.

About

12:30 pm
we spotted the first of about 8 dorsal fins. The
Orcas
were heading south at a fast pace, very spread out as they passed by James Island and Bird Rocks for about 15 minutes.

Just before
9 PM
was greeted by an unmistakable "Whoosh" just south of us. I wandered down to the neighbors, and discovered they had been watching the lone
gray
for several hours! The tide was in and the gray was feeding in close to the bluff on the ghost shrimp beds. Should be lots of "whale holes" at tomorrows low tide. The gray finally moved north toward the Mabana Rd. just before 10 PM.

We watched a nice
orca
parade this evening. Probably two dozen orcas traveling east to west between Aleck Bay and Iceberg Point off South Lopez. They were very spread out, taking about an hour (
6pm to 7pm
) for the parade to finish. There was one big male near the back of the group.

gray
whale off Lowell Pt, Camano Island at

(near Elger Bay & Camano Isl. State Park). No direction of travel given.

We received a call at

reporting
orcas
off Newport OR, in 15 fathoms of water. The report was heard via marine radio & relayed to us.
