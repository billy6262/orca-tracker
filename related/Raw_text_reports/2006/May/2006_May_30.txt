Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported they were able to get out with 26 members of

Half of
J's
doing their west side shuffle all day, going from Cattle Point in the morning to Kellett Bluff in the afternoon, then back towards Lime Kiln at

7:30 PM
. Heard that L's were at Race Rocks but they never materialized over hear. Meanwhile, K's were at the Coal Docks heading North. We had a wonderful viewing of J30, J14, and J40 all in a nice tight group. J-30 is getting ready to burst as he begins his sprout. At 11 years of age, he is on track to be Ruffles-sized in a few years!

Since last Saturday night (27th) the Mabana flats have been visited by
Grays
feeding. They come from
l
0:00pm to
1:00 or
2:00
