Orca Sightings for May 13, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had quite a dinner show while at Anthonys in Everett on the waterfront. We saw lots of spouting between the sea wall and Hat Island about
7:pm
. There were several [
gray
] whales and we think a mom and baby, they were out there over half an hour.

We spent some time with
J Pod
off Vancouver, (Coal Docks) from

13:45 -
14:30
. They were moving north, stopping to forage some and then continuing in a northerly direction. One beautiful spy hop, with Granny and Ruffles traveling together as well as Blackberry and Shachi and J-41.

We were gone but several of our neighbors said we had a pod of
Orcas
go buy Lagoon Point.

At

5:45 p.m
. I saw spouts and fins 1/2 mile south of the Bush Point lighthouse, 1/4 mile offshore. When I next saw them, they were headed north, and they were a tight group of 3-5
orcas
. One large, adult male and several adult females.

Christine Landen of the Coast Guard called at
3 pm
to report 4-6
orcas
including 1 male off LaPush, WA south of Cape Alava, 12 - 15 miles off shore. There was blood in the water around them - likely the same transients reported off Neah Bay the evening of the 12th.
