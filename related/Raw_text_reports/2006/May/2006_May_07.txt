Orca Sightings for May 7, 2006
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report 4
grays
feeding in the shallows off the NE end of Gedney/Hat Island at
2 pm
. Among them were Patch/#49, #22, & #723 - he didn't get a good look at the fourth whale.
