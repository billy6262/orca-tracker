I got several photographs showing that
J49 is a boy
! (Note: confirmed by the Center for Whale Research.) The water conditions were amazingly calm and J49 was coming out of the water so many times that I lost count. He was breaching, and spyhopping over and over again. On several occasions
his mom, J37,
and other family members were pushing him out of the water, and I was able to get a handful of shots of his belly! It was an awesome afternoon on the water!
Bart Rulon
Note: In response to some complaints that Bart was following these whales too closely, he sent this description: "I was viewing and photographing orcas in accordance with the law, as I always do when I am out on the water, and I had a witness on board, who is a dedicated whale research volunteer, who can testify to that, along with all my photographs to prove it. I have 12 years of experience working as a naturalist in this whale watching industry and I am well aware of the regulations. I was photographing with 896mm of telephoto lens magnification (400mm lens, plus 1.4 teleconverter. plus 1.6x crop factor on my digital camera) 400mm x 1.4 x 1.6 equals a total of 896mm. With that kind of lens power I, literally, don't want to have orcas closer than 200 yards away because it is too close for getting good photos. I have no interest in eye patch shots. I'm looking for enough room to see action and behaviors. My lens also has a distance range finder on it, showing the distance of my focus, and I check it often as extra assurance that I am 200 yards away."

After that, they were back,

Southern Resident Killer Whales
were spread out from
Salmon Bank to False Bay
today (48°26.51N, 123°02.29W). We viewed
at least 20 individual whales
but there were a number of other Killer Whales seen in all directions further in the distance. The whales were spread out traveling west. There were so many whales at one point we shut off our engines, dropped the hydrophone to listen to the whales vocalize, and simply watched the whales go by. With our engines off we were also able to hear the exhales of the whales as they surfaced. As we began to motor back to Friday Harbor we saw
another group of 5 Killer Whales
bringing up the rear. We stopped and watched these animals cruise by and again began to motor back. We didn't get very far though before
another group of 8 Killer Whales
surfaced. These whales were traveling in very close proximity with one another and included
J37 "Hy'Shqa" and her calf J49!

Many, many
Resident Orcas both yesterday and today
. We left them this evening off the
West Side, San Juan Island
. Much of the time was spent foraging and they seemed in great spirits. We continue to have amazing weather. Ah, September in the San Juan Islands!

I was out salmon fishing today
W of the Port Angeles
buoy. Had
a pod of Orcas
in the vicinity of N 48.11.961 and W 123.36.436 at

11:43 a.m.
There were
at least 6 orcas
and one was large male. A number of smaller orcas (females?) and it looked like one small orca - light gray and a small dorsal fin.

My son, who works on Cypress Island just saw
a super pod of orcas
go by them, I think
from Bellingham (or Guemes) channel toward Rosario St
. I don't know details, but he would.

today we saw almost
8 orcas in Bellingham channel
approaching Clark Point.
