Orca Sightings for September 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 65 -
T10's
Observers: Ken Balcomb, Barbara Bender and Florian Graner on "Shachi."
Earlier in the day, whale watch reports indicated that the T10's were headed east from Sooke, BC. ... Our encounter began just outside of
Cadboro Bay at
5:45 pm
. This group consists of three whales: mother, T10, with her two sons, T10B and T10C. ... We didn't see any obvious signs of a kill, but it is possible that they were hunting at that time. On average, their dives lasted approximately six minutes, except towards the end of the encounter when their dives were closer to eight minutes. The whales zigged and zagged north and east as they brought us back in the direction of home.

T010C
was having lunch to go near Whirl Bay west of
Victoria
. He had been poking around in a kelp bed and surfaced behind us with his prize - a harbour seal having a very bad day.
