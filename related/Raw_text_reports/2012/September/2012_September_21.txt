Orca Sightings for September 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Over
20 Southern Resident Killer Whales
were spread out between
Haro Strait, Spieden Channel, and Stuart Island
. The whales were initially headed north before they changed direction and began to travel east through New Channel. We were surrounded by whales; they were seen in all directions. Among the whales we identified
Scoter (K25) and Cali (K34)
, Scoter's younger brother. Also, we identified Onyx (L87) another large male born in 1992. Although the whales seemed to be spending most of their time foraging or traveling, a few individuals were performing aerial displays: breaching, lobtailing, and pec-slapping. With so many whales in the area and the flat calm waters we decided to drop the hydrophone, an underwater microphone, to see if we could hear the whales vocalizing. While sitting with our engines off listening to the whales exhale at the surface and vocalize and echolocate from below, a group of four whales changed direction. We were mesmerized as the whales traveled by, while their vocalizations echoed throughout our boat.

sighting of
approx 5 orcas off Lagoon Point
, what appears to be two large dorsals and three smaller dorsals ... What a moment to not have my telephoto lens ;-) but listening to their breaths over the calm water is exciting ...

I just got to
Mukilteo Lighthouse Park
and was told I missed
about 15 orcas and a baby
that would have come through about 15 min ago. Transients or Residents???? Going south so heads up Edmonds. Even if you missed the Orca show theres LOTS of sealions feeding on the salmon down here right now.

Note: these are believed to be transients, although no photos have been provided

Six to eight Pacific White Sided Dolphins
showed up about a mile off
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. They were heading down island and gave us quite a ride! More images and a video clip on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.
