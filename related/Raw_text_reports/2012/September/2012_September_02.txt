Orca Sightings for September 2, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bruce Clarkson called to report seeing
four orcas
while crabbing near Zephine's Head, just south of Mink Island in Desolation Sound (
northern Georgia Strait
). They were traveling east about 20 feet off Zephine's Head.
*
We got a call from another whale watch boat that they had found a group of
Transient Orcas
north of our location. Soon we were with the transients (turned out to be a group of 5 transients known as the
T30s
). They were just in travel mode and we relaxed into watching when BAM!!! Out comes the big male
T30a
in a breach that turned into a back-flip! But that signaled that something was up, and it soon was discovered they had just found lunch--
a lone harbor porpoise
. They made quick work of it, and soon settled back into a relaxed travel mode with lots of direction changes, but generally heading northwest... So the whales made an unexpected 180 and we became one of the lead boats. And that's when the fireworks started again! The T30s found yet
another harbor porpoise
and this time the porpoise put up a lot of effort to escape. The whales lunged out of the water repeatedly as they chased the porpoise. It was a strong reminder of why these whales are called Killer Whales, and they "played" and chased the porpoise for 10-15 minutes. Soon the deed was done and the porpoise was killed, but they took their time eating it. Gruesome but so amazing to see the power of these animals.

On our morning trip we ran into the
Transient T30 Pod near Gooch Island
. We last saw them eating harbor porpoise

We had an awesome day with
Transients, the T30's, by Gooch Island
. They were zig-zagging back and forth and then some activity started, one lunge, a big tail slap.
