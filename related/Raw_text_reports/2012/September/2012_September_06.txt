Orca Sightings for September 6, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 62 & 63 -
J's K's and L's
Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich on Orca, Ken Balcomb and Barbara Bender on "Shachi."
... left Snug Harbor at
9:00 am and immediately encountered J's and a mix of K's very spread out in small groups in
Mitchell Bay
heading up-Strait ... "Orca" left Snug Harbor at
9:35 and immediately encountered a mix of K's and L's in small groups heading up-Strait. ... At
10:20, "Shachi" encountered L90 with L92 not far away, both traveling at medium speed and surfacing normally. It is good to see that L90 has apparently fully recovered from whatever was ailing her last year (Encounter 62, 2011, et. Seq.). The entire loose assemblage of whales stretches at one point from Kellett Bluff to D'Arcy Island and north to Stuart and Gooch Island (spread over 18 square miles), and there were still whales being reported off southern San Juan Island. Shachi continued with this assemblage to the Canadian border in Boundary Pass off Bedwell Harbor before ending Encounter 62 (2012) at
12:25. The whales continued up Swanson Channel and went through Active Pass and into Georgia Strait around
16:00.
"Orca" left Encounter 62 at
11:15 and proceeded to southern San Juan Island to check out the report of whales lingering in that area, and by
12:25 found a very loose assemblage of L whales spread out off False Bay, ...these were two distinct groups of whales doing two different things (though all are SRKW's). ... the situation will likely become much more complex as temporary pod dissociation, mixing and splitting, spreading, etc. becomes the norm in this core protected "critical habitat" for SRKW's. The world is changing, the prey base (salmon) is far from natural distribution and abundance, and the top natural fish predators of this ecosystem (SRKW's) are responding in ways that we can barely discern. The most obvious response is in survival (eg., inter-annual survival (Ford, et. al., 2010)), but social organization and distribution also provide clues to change.
"Shachi" joined "Orca" at
2:03 off Hannah Heights to assist in the photo-inventory of the very spread and lethargic acting southern group. The highpoint of the afternoon was Dave's encounter with the new calf, L119, chomping on "something big" and subsequently playing with fish guts. This little female is certainly precocious and vivacious at an age no less than four months, and no more than about seven months. Perhaps these whales start eating solid food at a much younger age than we previously suspected!

I observed several orcas from the BC ferry Queen of Vancouver Island, about
4 pm
. The ferry was headed to Tsawwassen, BC from Swartz Bay, BC., through the
Strait of Georgia
. The orcas seemed to be in 2 separate groups, with at least 4-6 orcas in each group. They were breaching, porpoising, and possibly hunting. There was at least one male with a very tall dorsal fin. They stayed in the same general area, as the ferry moved on.

We had an anonymous report of a whale off the coast of WA - likely a
Gray whale
, spotted at
~
5:15 pm
from South Beach, south of
Forks, WA
. The observers were able to see only a large spout, and the whale was heading south.

We had
Dall's porpoises
bowriding for a good 20 min just outside
Victoria
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There were
four dall's
and one that looked to be a Dalls/Harbour hybrid.
