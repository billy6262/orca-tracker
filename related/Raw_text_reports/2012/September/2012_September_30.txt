Orca Sightings for September 30, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thought I would send this rather dramatic pic of the
T49's
, where one decided it was time for a bite to eat. We had watched the
Transients, all 5 in this group
just drifting slowly with the flood tide. They were slowly meandering through the tide rips off shore of
Race Rocks
. There were many Steller Sea Lions in the water at the same time enjoying the salmon run. It seemed very strange to me to see predator and prey together in what appeared to be a relaxed state. I would have thought the Steller's would have swam out of the way of these whales, but they didn't so it was 'game-on ' suddenly with walls of water and porpoising Transients all over. Even the youngest, a small calf, was in on the action. It was awesome to watch. Eventually after much twisting and turning of all the animals involved the Steller suddenly showed up along side our vessel. It stayed for a few minutes to catch its breath. The Transients appeared to head off in a westward direction but soon turned once again, to seek out the prey. The sea lion took off toward the safety of another whale watching boat, once we headed away to seek out other forms of marine wildlife at Race Rocks. I have never seen this dramatic action, and have no idea of the outcome, but secretly, I hope his 'Smarts ' allowed him to live another day. As we left a harbour seal showed up so perhaps the T's got a snack after all.

We encountered the
T36As with the T49As
pursuing a steller sea lion off Race Rocks. Multiple, powerful lunges were made by the orcas in an attempt to impact and wound the stellar. The sea lion made desperate attempts to get away by hiding under boats, but the orcas were ever patient and waiting for the appropriate moment to strike. We never observed the actual kill, just the chase. Incredible stuff, these are magnificent predators, and their cunning was extremely apparent during this encounter. The orcas had the upper hand the entire time, never letting the sea lion out of their sights.

I've seen at least
two groups of orcas
, both still north of the mid channel buoy (off Kingston). There's a recreational power boat out with them, keeping a safe distance. Almost too dark to see them now...

left with the
orca
still moving south spread out in small groups. A few were foraging mid channel out from
Kingston ferry
just before we left. At least two large males and one small calf were present in this stream of orca. Flaming sunset and golden moonrise. Beautiful male was so close. Once he was south of the ferry and just north of us in front of the marina he was probably 50 yards or so out. I thought we were gonna get a close pass by but couple of power boats exited the marina and he turned out... But no matter, it was a stunning majestic autumn evening! Bonus, the people around us were so excited, first time they saw a whale, and timing had the male dorsal surfacing just as the sun set behind him on the Olympic Mountains.

Pam Ren called at

5:50
with a long distance sighting from Edmonds across the "Possession Triangle" to
just north of Kingston
on the Kitsap side, of a "mess of orcas" spread out in small groups. Impossible to get a good count, but it sounds like more than 4-5, which makes them look more residents.

Elsa Leavitt called to say she saw
4-5 orcas
headed south past
Bush Point, Whidbey Island
, traveling close to the Whidbey Shore.
