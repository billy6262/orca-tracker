Unreal day today in the
Strait of Georgia
! Absolutely FLAT calm day with members of the
T100's, T101's, T124's and T90's
. We followed them heading east and then some
Humpbacks
were spotted! As the two species came closer to one another, the humpbacks started tail slapping and cartwheeling like crazy. I think the first pic are members of the
T124's
, you can see her eye checking us out!
