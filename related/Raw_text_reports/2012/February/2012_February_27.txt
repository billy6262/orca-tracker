We spotted one whale, (
small fin
), traveling South in
Port Susan Bay
. Sighting on the West side of Port Susan Bay near Port Susan Terrace Beach at about

12:45PM
today. We were not close enough for any distinguishing characteristics. We also spotted a whale which may have been a
Humpback
in the same area on
January 31st.

This sounds like it may be the Humpback whale we've had sightings of in Puget Sound recently - those of you in the Pt. Susan/Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage area, let us know if you see this whale - thanks!
