Orca Sightings for February 5, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I got IDs on at least
5 of the transient orcas
seen on Sunday about
2pm
. Near
Eagle Harbor (Bainbridge Island)
we encountered
6-8 transient orcas
-all appear to be female with a calf or juvenile included. They were headed north at a fast pace and split off into 2 sub groups, traveling in the same direction and ended up near
Golden Gardens
when I lost them.

Dave Ellifrit looked at the photos and identified these individuals:
This is the T100s and T124s. Individuals I can say for sure are there: T124, T124D, T124E, T100, and T100B). Jared Towers had these plus T87 up near Nanaimo about a week ago. There are other Ts around. I saw some video (from, I think, the last several days) from PS that had what looked like the T85s (who Jeanne saw from shore up here a couple days ago) plus an extra (third) young bull and others. The vid was not good enough to make any positive ids. Thanks for the pics. Cheers, Dave

I have a couple of pictures (not the best) of the unknown Orcas from this
afternoon
near
Restoration Point
(south end of Bainbridge Island). They were in travel mode, moving fast, and our boat was rocking a bit.

Graham Dewitt of WA St. Ferries just called - the ferry just paused to let
two groups of orcas
pass, off
Eagle Harbor, Bainbridge Island
, at about

2:10 pm
, headed north. He said there was one very small dorsal fin among them.

Was on the Bainbridge

2:05 p.m.
ferry. Two groups of
Orcas
about a half mile off
Wing Point, Bainbridge Island
. Groups were about 500 yards apart. They were both North of the ferry lane and also moving North. Didn't have my usual camera gear or binoculars, but my all too distant i-phone video shows maybe 6 in one group and at least 5 in the second group. Not sufficient resolution to make out good fin definition or possible youngsters. But, it was the talk of the ferry crowd, and I was amazed at how many said it was the first time they had ever seen whales in Puget Sound! Stunning weather and a pretty decent whale display ...

2:05 pm -
I can see them through binocs from my home above the
Sculpture Park
. They're heading north approaching Blakely Harbor on the way towards
Eagle Harbor
. Fairly close to shore. Can't count them from here, though.

Just saw
two groups of 3 or four each
very near each other in
Olalla, WA
. They are heading towards Seattle. The first group had very tall fins. It was so exciting. My daughter just had a presentation at school about orcas.

Stef Winslow We just had
four orcas
swim past our house on
Colvos Passage around
11:55 a.m.
We are about 3/10s of a mile up from Al's Grocery Store near the Olalla lagoon. They were heading north and quietly traveling through the passage. They seemed to be smaller and not stopping to feed. Our location is 47.422639 -122.53533 on the Olalla side not Vashon.

We were right by the boat launch at
Point Richmond
when two groups of
orcas
came through
Colvos passage
around

11:30
today. First group of 6 or so then about 8 more just a few minutes behind. My husband and I were in our kayaks not 100 yards away when they surfaced. It was amazing!! When we saw them there was a variety of fins sizes. One that looked at least 4 to 5' high - really tall - several mid size, and two or three that looked like babies to my inexperienced eye. We were in kayaks and very close. Scarily close, really. They surprised us when they surfaced and they were moving very fast. We counted 14 of them in two distinct groups.
