Tracey and Ian Cobane, who were staying at the beach cabin at Bold Buff today, saw a group of about
9 Orcas
swimming south in
Sansum Narrows
(Salt Spring Islands, BC) about
11 am
this morning. They returned, swimming North about 3 pm. Ian thought there were 3 big males, and a few babies, splashing and jumping (feeding? Playing?)
