Entry 1:
8 am ish
- They were off
Beaver Point on Saltspring, two groups of +/- 6 individuals
, roughly heading north. Fun to see them on a drizzly foggy morning! Bumblebee queens are out, bluebirds are back, currants & Indian plum kinda in bloom and
J pod
creeping about--must be spring!

Via Christopher Dunagan, Kitsap Sun: Don't know where "official" observers now have the status of the
humpback
but we definitely saw one again about

1:50 this afternoon
in EXACTLY the same spot as in January, just
north of the Great Bend
and toward the east shore. Both Jim and I saw it this time, with its tail up and also showing one side fin. It came to the surface only about three times before disappearing. We got two photos but neither show much detail ... going under at the time ... but the tail appeared to match the one photographed at Dabob Bay. Jim got a better look at the side fin and described it as looking like a humpback's.

Two very active
pinnipeds
were seen from the Bainbridge Island/Seattle ferry in mid channel this afternoon. Unusual:
Very dark black, much smaller than our normally seen CA Sea Lion males, no sagittal crest on head
. Very active diving, and jumping together as if hunting fish. Three possibilities: Juv. CA Sea Lions, Rare visiting female CA Sea Lions or rare visiting Northern Fur Seals. If anyone has seen Fur Seals in the Central Puget Sound Please contact Orca Network.
