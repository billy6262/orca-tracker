Orca Sightings for February 19, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
From comment on Watching Our Water Ways blog: The
humpback
is definitely still around. I was with a group of scuba divers at Sund Rock (just north of Hoodsport) on Sunday 2/19 and we spotted it during our surface interval around
11-
11:30am
. It was very close to shore and surfaced twice as it headed south. We got a good look at its back and tail flukes as it appeared to dive just off the point. I¹m 95% sure it was a young humpback; I¹d guess maybe 20 ft or so. It was close enough to shore that I think we would have had a good chance of seeing it if we had done our first dive along the south wall an hour later than we did.

We went out for a nice paddle today around
Gedney Island
, and on the way back to
Mukilteo
, we ran across
two gray whales
feeding, easily identified by the heart-shaped spout. They were about 1.5 miles S-SE of Gedney (~3 miles from the Everett waterfront). They would surface, take a breath or two, then hump the back and go down for 2-4 minutes. We never saw any flukes, so they must not have been diving to deep. We watched for about 15 minutes and they pretty much stayed in the same general area.
