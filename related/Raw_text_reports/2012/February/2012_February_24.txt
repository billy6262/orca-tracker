Orca Sightings for February 24, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got a call from Betsy Greene, reporting a whale with
a small dorsal fin
heading out of
Rich Passage
(east of Bremerton) at
3 pm
. She had also seen it earlier at
9am
. It sounds a lot like a
humpback
, which raises the question: was the whale seen in Rich Passage this morning at 9 am from the ferry also a humpback?
*
We have the great fortune of living on the beach for the winter, just at the west edge of
Langley
.
Two gray whales
yesterday evening, 50 to 75 yards off the bulkhead enjoying shrimp beds. Watched them and listened to the spouts between

5:30 and
6:15 p.m
.

Heard a few
calls on LK
about

10:10pm
just before the ship noise started in there as well. Kind of hinders the orca's conversation and the listening atmosphere.

9:43pm - J pod S4 calls
. Also heard echolocation.

Thanks to Alisa for alerting us to

.

We received a call from Lon Kamann of Vancouver Island, reporting
a pod of what appear to be Transient orcas south of Nanaimo, BC
- in NW Bay, Parksville, chasing sea lions around the logging boom Lon is working on at
~
10:20 am
this morning. There were 5 - 6 large fins, and several smaller fins. One orca chased a sea lion right into the bay and near the logging operation! They appeared to be heading in a northerly direction toward Denman Island.
*

11:43 am -
We just saw it again -- a she, I think. [The
killer whale
] is in front of the
Bremerton ferry dock
headed towards the Sinclair Inlet.

10:27 am -
I saw a single
killer whale
heading south in
Dye's Inlet
towards the Port Orchard Marina. We have seen killer whales in this area before (about four months ago).

John Rogstad of WA State Ferries called to say the captain of the ferry Chelan saw
a gray whale [
according to later reports this may have been a humpback whale
]
this morning about
9 am
, frolicking off Waterman Point while exiting
Rich Passage
.
