Orca Sightings for February 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I live in Olympia Washington near the end of Johnson Point. Looking down Dana Passage and
Henderson Inlet
from out deck at about

11:30 am
, we saw the fluke of an Orca. At one point, two flukes (dorsal fins?) were seen at the same time. They were quite a distance from us, so no further identification could be made. They were heading west, toward
Harstine Island
. We watched for another 30 minutes or so, but never saw them again.

Given the recent sightings of Risso's dolphins in that area and the lack of orca sightings, these are probably Risso's dolphins.

Great day with the whales today. Flat calm water and tons of tail slaps ricocheting across the sound. After the [
orcas
] passed through the
Vashon Ferry lanes
just before
2PM
they spent bit of time milling off of dolphin point then headed south and passed very close to shore along
Dilworth point
, on the east side of the island, at just about
3 pm
. They continued South, heading on to the KVI beach area and ultimately
Pt. Robinson
- where they passed at about

5:15
( missed that one darn!) Last report had them still southbound.
