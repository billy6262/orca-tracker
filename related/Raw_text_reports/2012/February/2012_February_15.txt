Orca Sightings for February 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Humpback whales
just north of the Great Bend in
Hood canal
.
Blessed Homestead
*
I was sitting on the deck enjoying the sunshine at CWR when
a small humpback popped up
just off the reef at about
1645
. I saw it blow once, then ran to get my camera, and then saw about four blows as it headed slowly north up SJI before it arched (did not fluke) and disappeared.
