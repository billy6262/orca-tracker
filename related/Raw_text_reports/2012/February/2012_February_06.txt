Orca Sightings for February 6, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Endangered orcas in Haro Strait 18 hours after sonar use.
Acoustic analysis,
Lime Kiln State Park
, Network news, Orcasound lab, southern residents:
Sounds of southern resident killer whales were detected late in the night on Monday (2/6/12), the same day that the
Canadian frigate Ottawa used sonar in their U.S. critical habitat starting at
4:49 am for about 40 minutes.
. The
calls most often used by K and L pods were automatically detected
first at the Orcasound hydrophone array (around
22:45) and then on the hydrophones at Lime Kiln State Park (

11:04-
11:14), suggesting that the pods were heading south during that period.
The calls recorded at Orcasound are interesting in part because they are audible over a continuously squeaking ship that has peak power in the frequency range of the calls. The most recognizable call in this set of detections is the S16 call which often indicates the presence of K pod.
The Lime Kiln recordings have much less ship noise. Many
S19 calls
are audible (indicating L pod may have been present), along with whistles, buzz trains, and some S10 calls. Around
23:11 the signal to noise ration is very good during a series of excited variable and S19 calls that are interspersed with echolocation clicks.

Transient orca encounter began at

3:05p.m
. Seven transient orca -
T85, T85A, T85B, T85C, T90, T90B and T90C
- heading north in
mid San Juan Channel
, approaching Flat Top and Spieden islands. They turned left and entered Spieden Channel and continued to move along the north shoreline of Spieden Channel, stopping for a few minutes to interact with some Steller sea lions. They passed by the south side of Sentinel Island and Rock, moved out
into Haro Strait and continued moving north
4:15pm
. For more see my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

We received a call from Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries, relaying a report from a ferry capt. of
~6 orcas in San Juan Channel
, just west of Yellow Island, northbound at

2:30 pm
.

Two different groups of
Transient Orcas
sighted today,
3-4 going through Active pass
and
another 6 off the north end of San Juan Island

A lucky day in the sunshine! About

1:30
, 3 whales went eastward through
Active Pass
(into Georgia Strait). A few spyhops, a breach and some tail slaps.

At approx

9:00am
I was at
Titlow Beach in Tacoma
and saw a pod of
6 Orca's
and further up possibly but out of my sight range
3 or more Orca
. I am attaching a couple of photos and I can send more photos directly so that you can get better views. One of the Orca's was almost coming on to the shore chasing seals. Being able to see these creatures was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.

4:49 am.
sonar pinging occurred in the waters off the south end of San Juan Island. The sonar got louder as the ship was heading in what appeared to be a northeasterly direction. The sonar lasted for about 40 minutes. The US Coast Guard in Bellingham was called and asked to pursue the incident. There was a Canadian Navy ship in the area. There is a short sample of the sonar sound on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.

This morning Jeanne (Hyde), our (OrcaSound.net) computers, and other listeners heard sonar pings on the live hydrophones between

4:42 and
5:08 am
. Preliminary analysis suggests the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca and southern Haro Strait were ensonifed by a Canadian frigate. It's possible there was also sonar use early in the day (and late 2/5/12) near the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The blog post regarding the (now confirmed) use of sonar by the Canadian Navy is now published.

Whales and dolphins of BC (and the UK!)
I've just had a message from Charlotte and they said they have been incredibly lucky and saw
a cow Orca , big bull and possibly yearling
at West Thurlow by Hardwicke,
United Kingdom
. They think there may have been one or 2 more.
