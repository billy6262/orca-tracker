============================================================

Entry 1:
Lots of
Orcas, Js and Ks, on the West Side
, and some of them went north in the evening. That means that we well could have them down here today again.

Thanks to a call from Jeanne Hyde and Breanna Walker hearing faint calls, Beam Reach students are observing
members of J pod heading north in Haro Strait
. First calls were heard by Jeanne at

7:15
and by Breanna at
7:20. I'm now beginning to hear clicks at Orcasound (5 km north of Lime Kiln) -- Speiden just passed the lighthouse, so they are pretty spread out.

I saw
a gray whale
yesterday around 6 pm in front of my house by
Boston Harbor, Olympia
. I think there was only one. It was going towards Olympia in the Budd Inlet.
