After a morning without seeing Orcas, I got the call from my wife. She was on the ferry and they just announced that
Orcas
were next to the ferry...But she didn't know where she was because she had been sleeping. In a few minutes we did find out where they were and raced over to
Harney Channel
(north of Friday Harbor) to see them. Later on this evening my wife and I went to see them near
Speiden Channel
. I love looking at Orcas. Great light today.

4:30 pm
on Maya's Charters we met up with the whales that had been spotted from the ferry a short time before. The whales were in
Harney Channel
heading west. They made at least two kills before reaching Pole Pass. After exiting Pole Pass they headed toward Deer Harbor. These whales are the
T49As and T49Bs
.

Dave Lahaie reports
3 killer whale fins
seen at

16:30
from the WA State ferry off Grindstone Harbor (S central
Orcas Island
). Heading west with whale watch boats in attendance. Probably transients.
*
At
1530
Chris Kennedy of Wash State Ferries called to relay a report of
7 orcas in Upright Channel
, adjacent to Canoe Island (NW side of Lopez Island), headed west.
*
One of our observers reported seeing
6 killer whales
west of
Neah Bay
near Warmhouse Beach today around

11:30 am
. He described a few smaller animals but did not mention any obviously large dorsal fins. Unfortunately Jon and I were unable to get on the water but I did call Scott Veirs to see if he picked anything up on the hydrophone.

We found the
Transient orcas
off Bush Pt, watched
8 - 10
of them including 2 males as they hunted back and forth off Bush Pt from
7 pm -
7:45 pm
. The dorsal fins looked like transients, but they were getting too far south & too far away to get ID shots. They seemed to be trending back south and further from the Whidbey side. Others at Bush Pt said they had been watching the orcas since

4:30 pm
.

six Orca
off our bluff (
Bush Point
area)

7:30 PM

1800 - Bush Point. Orca pod
seen between Bush Point and the south end of Marrowstone Island about mid channel. Estimate between
7-10 orcas
, two being big males. They were heading to the south, not in a hurry, viewed them for over an hour. Assume they were feeding. Two Males, one has a thinner fin.

Elsa Leavitt called to say she's watching
6 - 10 orcas
a little north of
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, with no clear direction, just splashing around.
*
Whale whale whale! Perhaps they circled around Vashon again?
Pod of likely transient
s possible same group from Monday with
6 to 7 animals
just passed by heading north in

at

now south end of Blake Island at

10:03 am - Two Orca
sighted heading northbound in
Colvos Passage
(N 47.23.6, W 122.31.94). Appeared to be a mother and calf.

10:03 am - Orcas
just seen heading north in
Colvos Passage
, just north of Olalla. Closer to the Vashon side in two separate groups about 200 yards apart from each other. One group had about 3, with one big fin, and the other group was about 4 or so smaller fins. Quite windy today so difficult to see them without the scope.

9:50 -
Jeff Hogan saw a couple of blows just north of the
Bainbridge ferry
lane, still heading north.

9:32 -
Jeff Hogan called with a sighting of some blows south of
Bainbridge Island
, heading north.

Just had a report of an unknown number of
orcas
headed northbound in Puget Sound - somewhere between
Blake Island and Alki
along the Vashon to Seattle Passenger only ferry route at
8:15 this morning.

Well, after watching the water from the foc'sle of the Tahlequah/Pt. Defiance ferry just about every weekday morning and evening for the past 14 years, I'm pleased to finally be able to report having seen
orcas--TWO of them!
(I've seen porpoises on several occasions--including several Dahl's porpoises this past Wednesday--but these are the first orcas I've seen off the south end of Vashon.) While they were too far away for me to have noted any specific markings, those amazingly tall dorsal fins were a clear giveaway that they were, indeed, orcas. I spotted the two swimming together just off the southwestern corner of
Vashon
(which I think is called Dalco Point, but I can't spare the time right now to check on this) at

8:10 AM
this morning. Given my understanding that that is a rather biologically productive location, I'm guessing that they were feeding--especially since they appeared to be lingering around Dalco Point for awhile. A few minutes before then, though, I had seen them just off shore from the Tacoma Yacht Club. So, it seems as if they may have made a beeline for Dalco Point, then settled in there for a meal.
