Just put my eye to my scope to look at a passing boat and up pops a gray whale with it's tail in the air! About a quarter mile off Whidbey, west of Naketa beach,

Cascadia received a report of a dolphin sighted off the pier near the Farmer's Market in
Olympia
which upon further investigation proved to be
a minke whale
. The whale was initially seen at

16:00
, then resighted and photographed from a distance at

17:23
. The whale surfaced 2 times, was taking longish dives and had no visible blow.
