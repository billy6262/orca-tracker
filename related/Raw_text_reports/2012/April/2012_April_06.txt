Just want to let you know that neighbors and I witnessed what I think was
ONE (possibly two) gray whales
feeding leisurely off shore of the west end of First St tonight,
April 6th, GOOD FRIDAY EVENING, right about sundown. Details: At about quarter to eight I'd gone out on our front deck. We live on First Street, across from the
Inn at Langley
. From our deck I was chatting with our neighbor Tim who was also out of doors enjoying the evening light. Suddenly I heard the telltale BLOW of a whale, and listened for more. Sure enough, there were more blows. Having lived on First St for 12 years now, I'm pretty accustomed to the sound. Tim and I quickly ran across the street to neighbor Norma Jean's place on the bluff top next to the Inn, summoning her from her kitchen. Pretty soon there was a small group of neighbors - Tim, his wife Kate, Norma Jean and her friend Joy, Simon and me - AND A FEEDING GRAY WHALE for all to see and enjoy! For a while we couldn't tell if it was one or two, but I'm pretty sure it was just
ONE LARGE GRAY
. What we were seeing was his pectoral fin and his tail fin as he fed. I believe he was up off of Veronica's, about 3-500 feet off shore there off of the west end of First Street. He fed there off of the west end of First Street for some 20-30 minutes, then we watched him swim eastward, toward Langley's downtown, where he stopped right in front of the INN AT LANGLEY, feeding for a few minutes more. We hollered "WHALE! WHALE!" for the Inn's guests to hear. The sun was setting and a lovely pink sky came over Saratoga Passage. The water was very still and calm. Tim captured all this on his ipad, so he will send us the video soon and I'll post to I LOVE LANGLEY. I call the whale a him, but he could have been a her... don't know. Shamefully I did not have my binoculars. But if Veronica was home, she may have seen and i.d.ed the GRAY whale. It was truly a lovely evening, and very peaceful. LOVE LIVE THE WONDERFUL WHALES WHO VISIT LANGLEY EACH SPRING!
