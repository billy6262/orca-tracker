Orca Sightings for April 17, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
The cool sighting of the day was that down toward the eastern end of the
Burrows Island
(NW of Deception Pass in Rosario Strait) about 100 yards west of the big white round buoy in the channel, I think I saw an
ORCA
! headed eastward around the end of the island. I saw its dorsal fin (a female?) and back, but not enough of it to identify the individual-- maybe a transient. It surfaced the one time that I saw it with the naked eye, and then I was too late to get my binoculars on it, but it resurfaced and I heard its blow. That made my day.

I saw a whale surface off of
Battle Point
sand spit (western tip of Bainbridge Island, Port Orchard Bay) at

6:30 pm
. It surfaced again a mile south then dove displaying it tail. I never saw an orca fin.

Updating, she's saying they're in the cove just S of
Cama Beach, Camano Island
.

My daughter just called reporting
Greys
out front. That's Saratoga between the Camano State and Cama Parks.

I saw a pod of
4-6 transients
from
Bainbridge Ferry
en route to Seattle in the
evening
. Approximately halfway through the crossing, I noticed the pod about a half mile north of the ferry, potentially pursuing prey as they appeared very active. There were some California Sea Lions in the vicinity.

10 am -
I spotted a group of
whales
moving N through the
Tacoma Narrows
, N of the bridges. I saw at least 5 spouts. My friend saw a tail. It was too far from my deck to get a good photo or make an ID. All I could see was the water disturbance and the spouting.
