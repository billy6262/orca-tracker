Orca Sightings for April 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
A few
orcas
did their own Tour de Lopez this afternoon coming past the
south end of Lopez
. A small, slow-moving, tightly packed pod of
5 - 7 orcas
traveled east past Iceberg Point, turned and headed out further in the Strait in a westerly drift with at least a dozen boats in pursuit.

One day the Residents, and the next the Transients, and then the Residents and then the Transients...We are soon to finish the best April that I can remember for Orca sightings. Orcas have been seen about two out of three days this April. Amazing. Yesterday it was the
Ts off of Iceberg Pt. Lopez Island
, with the Cascade Mts. in the background. We left them late, headed in the direction of Deception Pass
Capt. Jim Maya

We encountered a group of
about 12 transients Orcas, including T49As & Bs
, at
Iceberg Pt
on our trip this afternoon. These are the same transients we encountered about a month ago hunting seals near Yellow Island. Today, they were grouped tightly together in a resting pattern.

While I cannot identify them, I (and my flight-mates) saw a number of
orcas (more than 6) in San Juan Channel off Fishermen's Bay on Lopez, Saturday noon
. We were flying in on a Kenmore float plane.

09:19 PM - Transient Orca
are spending more time again close to Myrtle Rocks, just south of
Powell River
. This is the same group of
8 to 10 whales
including the two calves,
T02C and T20
that's been close to Powell River for most of April. There are lots of seals and sea lions in the area, so plenty to eat. Also below are some reports of Pacific White Sided Dolphins and Dall's Porpoise.

7:40 am
A call came in from Steve Grover that there were
Orca
just off the ferry terminal in
Powell River
heading Southward. They started to breach, spy hop and do some great tail lobs. I could identify
T02C
immediately and saw the two calves porpoising close by. With all the birds above, I assume they were on some food. A couple more spy hops, breaches and tail lobs and they carried on towards Grief Point.

10:30 am -
Taking their time, the
Orca
made it past Myrtle Rocks and continued heading South towards Black (Albion) Point and Lang Bay. No amount of activity.

Around

4:30 or 5 pm
: Thanks again for the call today, we really enjoyed seeing the
orca
. I tried to get some photos of their return trip (heading Northward). They were further off shore and doing long dives and milling around, so I guess they were feeding. No good show on the second viewing.
