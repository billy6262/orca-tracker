Orca Sightings for April 14, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted
three gray whales
from
Crescent Harbor
at about

6:30 p.m
. They were a long way off. One stayed quite a ways out between us and Camano Island. Two others traveled near the NEX parking lot on the Seaplane Base. We watched them for about an hour.

We saw a pod of
Orcas
making their way SE towards the
Kingston ferry
dock. Too far out to count accurately, it looked that there were more than four/five.
Peg Boley, South Camano

We sailed past
a pod of Orcas
on Saturday evening about
6 p.m.
about a quarter of the way from a line between
Marrowstone Island lighthouse and Fort Casey
. Approximate Latitude, Longitude 48.117571,-122.684927.
Counted between 9-12
including large males and several smaller ones in two separate groups. They appeared to be diving for 2-5 minutes at a time. Watched them for 10-15 minutes in heavy current.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research reviewed photos taken by John Haynes near Pt. Townsend, and identified the whales as: The
T100s, T101s, and T65As
are there and maybe the
T49As and T49Bs
in the background too. The adult male is
T102
and and there are several pics of
T100C
.

Matthew Clausen (sp?) called at

7:46
to say he had just seen
5 transients
next to the
Keystone ferry
, which was about the time we were watching at least three other smaller groups, 5 or 6 miles to the south, off Lagoon Point. So it appears the 2 tight groups of 6 - 10 in each group that we saw from Ft. Casey before 7 pm broke up into smaller groups, spread out over many miles.

We saw
a pod of about seven Orcas
(including juveniles) about 250 feet from shore heading South across
Admiralty Bay
(SW of the Keystone ferry landing). We are located about 1/4 mile down the beach from the Coupeville ferry terminal. Sighting was about

7:15pm
today!

We found the orcas from
Ft. Casey
, heading toward
Lagoon Point from Port Townsend
in two groups, between

6:30 and 7 pm.
It looked like about
15-18
in total. We headed to Lagoon Point, where we watched what look like Transients from
Lagoon Pt. from

7:45 - 8 pm
, as they continued south in several small pods. Too dark and distant for photos or IDs - hope they show up again tomorrow!

At

4:04 pm
Cindy called from the
Coupeville-Port Townsend ferry
with a report of
3 or 4 orcas
she was watching as she called. She says they are circling off the tip of Port Townsend. That sounds a lot like what the transient orcas were doing off Bush Point yesterday afternoon for at least 3 hours.
*

3:30 -
4:30 pm - 10 Orcas
just south of entry into Puget Sound off Whidbey Island southwest of
Fort Casey
. Generally southbound but kept circling around, pack swimming and at some times looking like they were playing with each other. At least one male. This was our first whale watching excursion.

Not sure when they began, but
transient orcas
were traveling south in
Haro Strait
, passing the Orca Sound hydrophones at

5:00a.m.
They continued vocalizing as they traveled down Haro, fading off and then being picked up on Lime Kiln hydrophones. I last saw them at

6:50 a.m.
, appeared to be 6 animals, they were south of Sea Bird Pt. by a mile or two.

Langley

two grey whales
feeding off their balcony Saturday morning.
