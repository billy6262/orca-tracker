Orca Sightings for April 16, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were in our boat headed to
des Moines off Vashon island
when we were treated to watching
a pod of 10 or so orca
. They had a chase boat with them which was cool. I'll send pix if I have any good ones. We were pretty far away, must have been around

2:30pm
. We were heading east, orca west along dash point side of shipping channel.

Sandra Pollard just called from the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
. She's seeing
4 or 5 orcas
, including two adult males, heading east a bit north of the ferry lane. At the same time the captain of the ferry just reported
a gray whale
off the bow.

We lost them shortly after
3 tree point
. They either turned when I was driving to Point Robinson or managed to shoot past the folks waiting - possible if they hit the far shore as it was pretty blustery. That was around

12:30 ish
.
