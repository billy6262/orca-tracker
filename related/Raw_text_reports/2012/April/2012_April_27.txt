Calm seas, sunshine, and
ORCAS
! Upon leaving the harbor we traveled along the east side of San Juan Island and found members of the
J-Pod
at the
southern end of the island
. For much of our encounter, the whales were spread out over a large distance but would then regroup and spend time within close proximity of each other. Whales were traveling, milling, and exhibited foraging behavior, although no fish were seen. We heard amazing vocalizations using our underwater hydrophone; squeaks, squeals and percussive sounds.

It was SO cool to see these
three orcas, with Monterey Bay
Whale Watch! I've seen
CA20
(adult male) and
CA54
(adult female) before; they were first photographed together in Monterey Bay in 1987 - old timers! It was my first sighting of
CA177
, a younger female and relative newcomer, first seen in Monterey in 1997.
