Entry 1:
Folks - there is a
pod of Orca whales
swimming off of
Anderson and McNeil Islands

Amy Carey reports that a friend heard
orcas
in
Colvos Passage around 11 pm
.
*
Natasha Bevin called after seeing
8 - 10 orcas
from the
Tacoma Narrows park
. They were headed south between Fox Island and Gig Harbor. She said they came very close to shore as she walked and ran down the beach with them. She said at one point three orcas lunged after two ducks, but the ducks got away at first. Then the orcas dove and came back from under the ducks, and "there go the ducks."

8:14 -
There are
2 Orcas
right off of
mcneil island
. Right across from where the ferry leaves steilacoom. Saw a nice big pod of
porpoises
. Big unidentified whale swimming midchannel between steilacoom and mcneil. Tonight is my lucky night! I don't have a camera.

Titlow beach

Narrows Bridge

I spent nearly 8 hours following this group of
transients
from
West Seattle down to Titlow Beach in Tacoma

There was a
pod of Orcas
off
Point Defiance
Sunday night. There were about
5 -6 minimum
. They were close to the shore by Point Defiance headed south towards the Tacoma Narrows bridge. They crossed the channel towards the Gig Harbor side. This was about

5:30pm
. There was some sort of research type of boat trailing them. Later that night (about

7:45pm
), as we were entering our marina, we heard another call on the radio warning a boat "Slow down, there are killer whales dead ahead" so they were
still around
a couple of hours later.

On our
Monterey Bay
Whale Watch trips today, Nancy Black and Alisa Schulman-Janiger saw
three groups of transient killer whales
. On our morning trip we saw a group of
10 whales that included the CA39s and the CA180s
that had killed a minke whale and were feeding on it. On the afternoon trip we first saw the
CA51s, and later saw the CA138s
that had killed a harbor seal.

Just wanted to report
two separate killer whale
sightings in
Monterey
today. The first sighting was a group of 8 killer whales including this male,
CA24
. They attacked and killed a Minke Whale. The second sighting of killer whales was of 5 animals, the ones known as the
CA51's
. They were also feeding on something but could not confirm as to what it was.

6:30pm - gray

whidbey shores
! We are just south of the spit on the cliff. Headed south! Slowly!

While enjoying, the beach on Ala Spit, heard spouts off Hope Island (north end of
Saratoga Passage
). Perfectly calm waters/easy to hear the spouts/not so easy to see them.
Gray
hugged Hope's rugged/rocky bank shoreline. Traveling at a snail's pace. Few spouts/most of the time submerged. Continued this pattern as it cruised over to nearby Skagit and Kicket Islands. First time ever have seen a gray around these picturesque islands. Kudos to Orca Network for posting a gray sighting in this area recently. Would not have gone/been there enjoying this evening's experience without the report. Thank you.

While looking for the Transient orcas reported in Saratoga Passage (anyone else see them yet?), I saw
a Gray whale
spout a few times between
Noon &

12:20
- south of Elger Bay,
W. Camano Island
, looks like it's feeding in the shallows & heading slowly south.

Suspected
whale
surfacing in Oak Harbor as we were finishing up rounding the final stretch of the Whidbey Island Half Marathon today! Definitely something out there, but hard to see exactly what from the distance.

Victoria Clipper III encountered
gray whale #22
today about

10:15
, just north of the
Mukilteo-Clinton ferry
lanes, midchannel. We slowed down for the ferries to cross in front of us, and as soon as they had passed, we saw #22 blow. Followed him north toward G
edney (Hat) Island
, then he crossed our bow and we left him heading SE toward the Everett waterfront. One passenger reported seeing a few porpoises in the area where we first spotted #22, as well.

Just observed a
pod of orcas
swimming south from
Camano Head
past the west side of Hat Island down to the Mukilteo/Columbia Beach ferry crossing. They are still frolicking just north of the ferry crossing. There was one, maybe two full size adults and at least 3, maybe 4 very small juveniles! SO SPECTACULAR!!!!!

Got in from mowing at about the time of your last post. So I went down and sat at the end of the dock at
Baby island
and could see the
2 orcas
way way across from Fox Spit on the Camano side. I then took a drive down to
Bells Beach
and saw them again
(
5:40 pm
), got a photo but it's not very good. then I lost them? Don't know which way they went. There were 2 boats out there, one big and the other smaller, they stayed way back from them :) I just got back and wanted to post right away but blessed to have seen them :) finally!

5:30 pm -
can just barely make out the
Transients
in south Saratoga Passage now - they are nearing Pebble Beach on the south end of
Camano Island
. What a wonderful day for watching whales in the Salish Sea - many thanks to all who reported their sightings today!

4:50 ish
, spotted more of the
Transient
pod in Saratoga Passage, just south of Elger Bay,
SW Camano Island
, still heading south at a pretty good pace.

4:40 -
I just saw two of the
Transients
in Saratoga Passage, just south of
Cama Beach
, closer to the Camano side. Looks like they are still hunting, but still heading south - now they're behind trees, but should be able to see them again soon. Love it - I think this is a first for me getting to see both Orcas and Gray whales from our home/office window in one day!!
