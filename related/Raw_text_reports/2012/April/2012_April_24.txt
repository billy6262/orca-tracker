I received a call that
whales were passing Lime Kiln lighthouse
heading my way. I spotted transient orcas off Andrews Bay heading north at about

12:15
. They soon changed direction and headed back south. Out on Maya's Westside Charters in the afternoon we met up with the same whales as they were heading offshore,
toward Hein Bank
. The whales present were
T49A, T49A1, T49A2, T49A3, T49B, T49B2, T65A, T65A2, T65A3 and T65A4
. They began porpoising and continued to do so as they changed direction heading east. We left them at

3:30
off
Iceberg Pt. Lopez Island
as they continued heading east.

It wasn't until
Pile Point
before we caught up with
3 of the T-100's, including T101 and T102
(48°28'N, 123°05'W), traveling south from Pile Point off the
west side of San Juan Island
.
Another group of Transients
were reported behind us (
6 or 7
). We stayed with the T-100's till the Salmon Banks buoy before heading towards Cattle Pass and home. A stop at Whale Rocks gave us great viewing of hauled out
Stellar Sea lions
covering one end, while several more milled about in the water. And, just like yesterday, we found several groups of
Harbor Porpoises
foraging in San Juan Channel, between Lopez Island and Turn Island.

"Spouting News"
GRAY SKY GRAY SEA GRAY WHALE
On the way home from
Oak Harbor around
5:30PM
, got a call from a friend/neighbor that a gray whale was out front. When I arrived,
gray
was still feeding out front near the shore in calm gray waters, with gray skies. Everything gray. Activity included slow swirling with fins out of water, as the whale fed on sand/ghost shrimp. After a brief snack, gray headed pass Mariners Cove pilings/marina jetty entrance. Decided to go from beach to boat whale watcher. When I got out of the marina, the gray had turned and now was spouting/heading back/southwest towards Polnell Point. Picked up another friend on shore and we followed the gray. Gray was feeding almost the entire time we were out there. Usually hundred to 300 feet from shore. Slowly, moving and feeding; both perpendicular and vertically/straight out from beach. Head popping up, fins out of water, water churning, and spouting when necessary. We left the gray halfway between Mariners Cove and Polnell Point. Still feeding in changing windy conditions and a choppy sea. A timely treat on a truly "gray" day.

At

5:06
a neighbor and I spotted
a Gray whale
just south of
Strawberry Point
(east of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island). S/he was initially heading south, appeared to stop quickly at the local shrimp bed at Mariner's Cove, then turned and headed north.
