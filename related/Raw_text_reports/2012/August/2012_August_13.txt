Orca Sightings for August 13, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Watched from San Juan
County Park
as
J, K and L pass by Low Island
in the morning. Amazing sight seeing so many orcas pass by at the same time.

Around

8:30 AM off Hannah Heights
, West side of San Juan Island, heading North.
Lots of whales
spread out over a wide area. One large group of 10 or more moving together. Definitely multiple males in the group.

J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait
- excerpt from the commentary by Ken Balcomb: "We think that it is quite interesting that the arrival of K pod from the north yesterday and L pod from the west today in a sort of pincer movement around Vancouver Island is suggestive of some sort of pre-planning on the part of the whales. Of course, if there were gobs of Chinook salmon coming into the core habitat area from both directions at the same time that could serendipitously explain the coincident timing of arrival. But, by all official accounts there are not good returns of Chinook salmon to this area from any direction."

I actually saw the southern resident
SUPERPOD
of orcas this morning off
Lime Kiln
!! It was my dream come true! They were the closest I've ever seen.

I cant account for everyone but most definitely had an amazing pass of
members of all three pods
this morning. Nice tight groups,
L41
included in the last group of 22+ whales, modified resting- close to shore, all up, all down. It was something we don't get to see very often anymore - the close knit groups, resting, close to shore. A magnificent start to the week.

Killer Whales from both
K- and L-Pods
were headed north along the westside of
San Juan Island
. The whales were reported heading north from Lime Kiln State Park. We caught up with the leaders near
Open Bay
(48°34.824N, 123°11.685W) who were mostly members of K-Pod. We traveled with these whales to Kellett Bluff where we waited for the rest of the group to travel north. We saw over 15 whales as they cruised by. At times we were surrounded by whales as a few individuals were traveling further offshore as well as the whales that were seen ahead and behind us; we didn't know in which direction to look! It was wonderful. Since the seas were flat calm, we even had a chance to turn off the engine and just enjoy the sunshine and the whales, listening to them exhale as they surfaced. Sigh. It was marvelous.

8:52am -
Hearing some
KW calls on Lime Kiln
, behind and between ship noise.
*
Yup-- I saw the parade (lying in my bed, no less! How awesome is that??) as they all passed Eagle Cove and rounded
Eagle Point
, from a little after
7am
this morning, onward. It was the sound of their breathing that woke me. Pure magic.
