Orca Sightings for August 30, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 59 -
J, K, L pods from Haro Strait, East Point
.
Center for Whale Research

We caught up with
four Southern Resident Killer Whales near False Bay
. This group of Killer Whales included
Cappuccino (K21)
a mature male born in 1985, as well as,
Opus (K16)
and her son
Sonata (K32)
. The whales were initially traveling southeast before changing direction and double-backing to the west. Further to the west we spent time viewing another group of Killer Whales near Pile Point (48°28.0017N, 123°05.6076W). All in all there were roughly
20 whales spread out
along the
southern end of San Juan Island
. Although the whales were largely spending their time traveling, a few individuals performed aerial displays; in total we saw 5 breaches! Crazy AWESOME!
