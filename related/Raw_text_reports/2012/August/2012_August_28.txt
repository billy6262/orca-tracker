South of
Henry Island
(48째35.33N, 123째12.53W) we began to see spray...the spray of
four transient orcas
! They were moving towards the northeast, hugging the shoreline. We believe this group included
T19B
. Just to the west, closer to
Sydney Island
(48째37.30N, 123째15.69W) we observed another group of four transients, possibly
T60s
, milling and then moving to the northeast.

I would like to report a whale sighting: At approximately

2:30 PM
aboard the Sea Lion of San Juan Safaris, we sighted a group of
3-4 transient orcas
swimming south along the shore of
Sidney Island
(Haro Strait). The was 1 male and 2-3 females following closely behind. They were surfacing in rapid succession, then diving for an extended period of time.. I heard something about the T60 pod, but I cannot be sure it was about these whales. Later, at about

3:15
, we saw
another transient pod
, also with 1 male and a few females, but this group was surfacing and circling a point in the water. Perhaps they were tracking prey, or engaging in some other activity.

We watched them attack and apparently eat a harbour porpoise in
Swanson Channel
opposite
Pender bluffs
. Another big leap was involved in this kill, although not as high. And on
Aug. 26-27 (both days) they did a loop across the Victoria
waterfront, occasionally munching on seals and causing shrieks of excitement from onlookers as they cruised close in to the Dallas Road shoreline, including directly below Victoria's iconic Ogden Point breakwater. Same route, both nights!
