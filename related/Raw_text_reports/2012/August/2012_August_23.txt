Orca Sightings for August 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
After quite a search, the elusive
minke whale
was spotted west of
Waldron Island
(48°41.44N, 123°05.42W). Surrounded by seabirds, including rhinoceros auklets, common murres, and glaucous-winged gulls, a bait ball was just under the surface. Several surfaces by the minke allowed us to see that curved dorsal fin and pointed rostrum. My oh Minke!
