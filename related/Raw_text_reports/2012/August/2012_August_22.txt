Orca Sightings for August 22, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 54 -
J's, K's and L's in Haro Strait.
With representatives of all three pods in the inland marine waters of the Salish Sea, we opted for a two vessel encounter with the whales today. Dave, Erin, Stewart and Kathy embarked in "Orca" and Ken and Barbara embarked in "Orca Starlet" upon hearing news of whales in Haro Strait again. More on the this encounter and incredible photos at the link above.

Entry 2:
. We got a very good look at
four Orcas
who were swimming along just off the port side. One was large (large fin on his back), two slightly smaller, and what seemed to be a very little one too. In the distance, we saw a couple more spouts, but were not close enough to get a good look at what/who it was!

off
False Bay
area. A naturalist on-board took a photo that clearly showed the distinctive nick in her dorsal. She was traveling with Princess Angeline/J17. Some K's and L's in the area.
