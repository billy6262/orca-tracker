Orca Sightings for August 31, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 60 -
J, K, L pods in Haro Strait
.
Center for Whale Research
*
'Mystic Sea' went the distance to
Tsawwassen ferry dock, BC
, to spend time with members of
J pod
enjoying the Fraser River salmon. Active whales traveling at speed among the whitecaps - and little J49 knows how to breach...
Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island
*
Today we saw several members of the resident
L-pod
actively feeding offshore of
South Beach, SJI
, (48°26'N, 123°00'W). First we saw members of the
L12 matriline
, including
L41 "Mega"
. He was switching directions and slowly coming to the surface. At one point he rolled on his back and slapped the water with his pectoral fins and tail. We also saw L94 "Calypso" with her calf L113 "Molly". "Molly" was very active, splashing, rolling, tail-slapping. L77 "Matia" was also spotted with her calf L119 born earlier in 2012.San

Just south of
