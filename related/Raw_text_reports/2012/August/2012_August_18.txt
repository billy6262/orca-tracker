Out on the Mystic Sea: Foggy & cold but we did enjoy seeing the Steller and California sea lions on Whale Rock
between San Juan and Lopez Islands
. No orca today but we eventually did have an encounter with
a Minke
somewhere off Iceberg Point, Lopez at about

2:15
. She/he surfaced about 8-10 times (in sweeping circles) before she/he went on a long dive. We moved on to explore the south end of Lopez full of harbor seals and their pups before heading back to port.

The waters on the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
were calm which made the observation of surface activity noticeable! We spotted a harbor porpoise making quick dives just off the bow of the boat. So many different species of sea birds too. Rhinoceros auklets, pigeon guillemots, common murre, and Western gulls were out feeding Then the appearance of the mysterious
MINKE whale
! Feeding in the surface waters, it was silently cruising for schooling fish and plankton (48°24.88N, 122°51.61W). We enjoyed the natural air conditioning as we travelled through the San Juan archipelago today.
