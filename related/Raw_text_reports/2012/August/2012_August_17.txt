With the southern residents having made a quick overnight visit to the west side of San Juan before heading out again, we spent time with
two or three minke whales off Salmon Bank
around

1:00 pm
before checking out the Steller sea lions on Whale Rocks.

I live about 1/4 mile north of the
Tacoma Narrows
bridge, on the water, on the
Gig Harbor
side. About 10 minutes ago, we watched two Orcas heading north at a pretty good clip, with the outgoing tide. They were hugging the Tacoma side of the narrows. I have not seen any emails from you with sightings this far south so was very excited, of course. We have a good pair of Steiner binoculars, so I am confident they were Orcas...not confident of the number though...it i was at least two. Now that I have typed this, my husband tells me they are heading back south and are now back in front of our house, but across the water still on the Tacoma side. I will keep you posted.

Note: Since there were no other reports of orcas in Puget Sound around that time, it's possible these could have been the two Risso's dolphins that have been seen there several times over the past month.
