Helena Symonds reported
Ks & Ls
going by OrcaLab (Hanson Island, N end of Vancouver Isl) silently at
5 am
heading into
Johnstone Strait
, and Nick Templeman reported the following at

3:12 pm
:
Southern Resident Killer Whale are coming up to Browns Bay, Johnstone Strait
, headed South! Should be passing Campbell River in a couple of hours!
*

2:22 pm - There are calls on Lime Kiln
:)

2:21 pm -
Hearing
calls
and echolocation at
Lime Kiln State Park
hydrophones! I think I hear the new baby!!!

Members of J pod
had spread out almost half the length of San Juan traveling south in
Haro Strait
between
Lime Kiln and False Bay
(48°32.15N, 123°00.87W). The first whale we encountered was
Doublestuff (J34)
rolling around and traveling amongst a few females enjoying the sunshine and family time. The next group we came across was Hy'Shqa (J37) and her VERY new born calf J49 with Grandma
Samish (J14)
monitoring close behind. What a blessing to see the little one so healthy and keeping up right alongside mama!!! Then we ran into
Onyx (L87)
foraging by his lonesome and out of nowhere popped up
Blackberry (J27)
right off our stern. I swear he has a "thing" for the Kittiwake because he always pays us a visit on that boat! The last family we encountered were the J16s; Mama
Slick (J16)
leading her offspring and Big
Mike (J26)
.

10:32 - Orcas close to shore at False Bay
heading south now.

10:02 - Orcas offshore of False Bay
heading north.

Got to check in with new mom
J37
this morning.
J49
looked even smaller being so far away, but there he/she was! Amazing how tiny a six-foot, 400 pound animal can look.

Wow - what a day for
Transient orcas
in the Salish Sea! We finally were able to get out to look for them in
Admiralty Inlet
, and first saw them from Lagoon Pt. at
5:55 pm, heading north at a fast pace. We observed two pods, including 1 male, mid-channel - by

6:20 pm
they had passed
Lagoon Pt
. looked like they were heading toward Admiralty Bay. We headed up to a bluff on the border of Ft. Casey/Camp Casey, and found the orcas as the first group had just passed Ft. Flagler on Marrowstone Island, at about

6:45 pm
. They were off
Pt. Townsend
by ~

6:55 pm
, and another group followed and were off Pt. Townsend by about

7:05 pm
. A third group followed, passing Pt. Townsend at about

7:15 pm
. They all continued heading west at a good clip; the three groups seeming to be traveling a bit closer together. We left at

7:25 pm
and they appeared to be continuing west
toward Pt. Angeles
. This made up for missing them last night when they headed into Admiralty Inlet! Brad Hanson of NOAA was able to spend much of the day with them, so we will get more ID's by next week.

7:07 pm - Dozen or so orcas
just spotted near
Port Ludlow.
Anna Henson
*
Just heard from my friend at
Bush Pt
, Barbara Mundell - they got their spotting scope out and the whales were off Bush Pt. at

7:43
, a group of
7
, including a young one. This fits with the sighting off Pt. Ludlow, and makes the 4th smaller Transient pod heading out of Puget Sound today. We saw a total of ~14 - 18 orcas in the first 3 groups, with 7 more, that makes
21 - 25 total Transients in Puget Sound and Admiralty Inlet
today - incredible!

5:58 -
Paul Kukuk called with a sighting of
orcas off Lagoon Point
, headed north in mid-channel.
*

5:30 -
Pat Scott reports the
orcas
have reached
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island.
*

4:50 -
the
transients
have reached
Double Bluff
.

4:18 -
Brad Hanson reports the transients are travelling at 16km/hour (about 10 mph) northward.

3:30 -
Brad Hanson of NOAA's NW Fisheries Science Center reports seeing
12-14 transients
, all females and juveniles, no males, at first angling toward Mukilteo, then turning back NW into
Admiralty Inlet
.
*

3:05 -
Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries reports that the captain of the Puyallup saw
3 orcas
one mile west of the
Edmonds
ferry terminal, headed toward Mukilteo.
*
While sailing, we saw a pod of
6 or 7 orcas
swimming north not far off the
Edmonds
marina. I got some pictures. If someone can identify the individual whales from the pictures, then that would be great. They were swimming fast in a northerly direction. We saw them about
3 pm
.
Martin Proudfoot
*
From the numbers we saw, my guess is these two groups met up. At

4:15
Ed, Pam, and I left Edmonds where we could still see the
Transients
surfacing mid channel of
Pt No Pt & Scatchet Head
, appeared they were nearing Useless Bay. We still could not discern if they were heading up Admiralty or towards Possession. Research boat still with them.

3:40 - T's
are zig-zagging. Difficult to say if they'll head up Admiralty.

3:15 -
still northbound steady pace. mid channel between
Edmonds/Eglon
. Looks like NOAA on scene now.

2:41 -
Pretty sure we could see up to a dozen when at
kayu kayu
.

Graeme Dewitt of WA State Ferries relayed a report from the
Edmonds/Kingston
ferry of
at least two orcas
in the ferry lane, headed north.
*
Ferry enroute to
Kingston
dock. Announcement over the loud speaker of
killer whales
off the port bow at about

2:45
. Two whales rapidly approached the ferry, a large, adult male with a slight bend in the tip of the dorsal fin (tip bent toward the right side) following either a large juvenile or female. Both surfaced quite close to the ferry, within fifty feet, headed north and directly perpendicular to the port side of the ferry. Saddle patches were large and appeared to be closed but the whales did not fully expose the entire saddle patch. Unfortunately I did not have my camera or cell phone but lots of folks were taking pics. Hope you get an ID.

2:45 pm -
Wendy Harper reported seeing
orcas
, including one male, just south of
Kingston
, headed north.
*

2:28pm -
Estimate
4-6 females / juveniles, plus 1 male
in the rear of the group. Approaching
Kingston-Edmonds
ferry lane.

2:21pm -
Another direction change, now east of mid channel. Still headed north.

2:15pm -
Veering towards
Kitsap peninsula
side now. People in and around Kingston: get ready! They're really moving!

2:15pm -
Yep, I have them mid-channel, about half mile south of the mid-channel buoy. Making their way north at a rapid pace.
Dave Haas

2:10 -
still northbound mid channel between
RICHMOND
beach and
Jefferson head
.

1:25 pm - 4 - 5 orcas
including a calf passed
Golden Gardens and Carkeek Park
, heading north toward Richmond at a fast porpoise, closer to the King County side of the water.

1:15 pm - 5-6 whales
heading north off of
Shilshoe Bay
Marina, Seattle. Too far away for more detail.

We saw
two groups of orcas
in the area between
Shilshole and Bainbridge Island
. We sighted the first group between between
1230 and 1 p.m
., between West Point and Shilshole, less than a mile offshore, heading North. They were moving right along in a straight line, and I would think that they were transiting, rather than playing or feeding. There were at least 6-7 total, and maybe more. The main group was bunched together pretty closely, and there may have been a young one in the mix (based on size).
A male with a very tall dorsal
was traveling about 30-50 yards behind the main group. There appeared to be a faint grayish marking 1/3 to 1/2 of the way up the big male's dorsal. About half an hour later (
1:20 p.m.) we saw a smaller group about .8 miles off of Fay Bainbridge park, also heading North. This group appeared to be made up of 3-4 orcas total. There was a male traveling with this group, although his dorsal was not as tall as the previous one that we saw. This male had a slight bend to his dorsal, and a prominent gray saddle immediately aft of the dorsal. Sadly, we twice heard people call the Coast Guard on the radio to report boats traveling too close to the orcas, once before we saw them, and once almost an hour later. As you can imagine, there were a fair number of boats in the area on such a nice day, but everyone seemed to be keeping a good distance off when we saw the orcas. And to top it off, saw a few harbor porpoises a little Northwest of where we saw the second group of orcas.

12:30 - Orcas
heading from Seattle, mid way between
Bainbridge & Shilshole
, very far away, could be 2.

11:39 -
Back out in the
Bainbridge Seattle ferry lanes
!

Attached are a few photos of Orcas seen today at the south end of
Bainbridge Island
. We first spotted them some distance away on the west side of Blake Island - about 4 seen. Then numbers increased and we estimated
10-15 whales
in total, and they then headed over to where we were fishing at the south end of Bainbridge. I'm sure lots of people on the Bremerton-Seattle ferry got photos also, but have a attached a few. We saw them at 11
am to approx. noon
where they headed north following the east side of Bainbridge - a few seemed to be playing and/or feeding - splashing and lifting their tales out of the water.
Sam & Bret Steck
From the photos sent in by Sam & Bret Steck in the previous whale report of transients in Puget Sound: The bull is
T20 and then T37 plus possibly T36A and T36A2
are in the 5th picture. Brad had pictures of the
T37s, T36, T36Bs and the T99s
(in Puget Sound).
Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
T20 and T21 for sure, T28A, I think all the T28s
. T20 (kwatsi) and sister T21 (Pandora ) were sighted last week in Campbell river and travelled south to Puget Sound.
Josh McInnes

1 male, 6-7 females & juveniles
. Spread out, heading south, southeast.

about 8 orcas heading north up Rich Passage
about 100m from the Bainbridge shoreline about

9:30
.

John Rogstad of WA Ferries called to relay a report from the ferry Kitsap of a
"herd of frolicking orcas" off Restoration Point
.
*

Jefferson Head, Seattle @
6:20. There were 4
, I think 3 female and a litlle guy. They were down last night.
Karen Chapin Rhinehart

Just got back from fishing, but wanted to report a sighting. I have attached a video so that may be someone can identify them. It looked like there were
6 orcas
, maybe a juvenile male and the others female. The first sighting we had was on the south end of
Jeff Head
north of
Bainbridge Island
at

6:00 AM
. They made a circuit around the island and we saw them again on the south side of the island near
Restoration Point
at approximately

11:10 AM
.
