3:30 pm -
Eugene Thrasher was at the
Admiralty Head Lighthouse
, at Ft. Casey, Whidbey Island, when he saw
two orcas
headed north out of Admiralty Inlet in the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Report relayed by Janet Hall.
*
Morning surprise - We settled in south of the lighthouse at
Lime Kiln State Park
, and within 5 minutes at

9:55am
, out of the stillness of the morning, we hear an enormous exhale. A
humpback
surfaced 100 feet off the rocks where we sat. It surfaced once again, nearly in front of the lighthouse then went down for a deep dive. From the utter surprise, this calm morning erupted into cheers up and down the park and filled us up with wonderment and gratitude. Humpback continued northward last we heard past
Speiden Island
.
