At 6.15PM
I was parked at Davis Bay on the
Sunshine Coast
, near
Sechelt BC
Canada.
3 Orcas
swam by about 400m offshore, heading S. I have seen a lot of orcas but the big one did the most sensational "spyhop" I have ever seen. Presumably these were the same 3 orcas that have been seen off Pender Hbr this summer........reputedly a mother & 2 calves.

I thoroughly enjoy following the Orca Network emails and photos, and I am especially a huge fan of Capt Jim Maya's photos. I had the great privilege of going on a whale watch with Capt Jim and we saw 4 transients (
T18's I believe? T18, T19, T19-B, and T19-C
) in
Canadian waters north ofSnug Harbor
. Orcas are my absolute favorite animal, and this was truly an incredible day. I've been on whale watches before, and even on a few in the San Juans before, but nothing can compare to the wonderful experience I had with Jim and his assistant Jeanne. I've seen J- and K-pod Residents before, but never Transients. I was beyond excited. We were able to witness them hunting harbor seals! I am passing along a few photos, although I'm sure Capt Jim outdid me with his wonderful photography. We saw the orcas cruise along the shore while hunting, and we even witnessed a few fluke slaps. In the tail fluke image, there appears to be a harbor seal tail just to the right of the orca.

5 Transient Orcas
came into the Salish Sea today, made a kill, and quickly headed back for open water. We found them at approximately

2:30PM
right off
Java Islets
in Boundary pass circling their kill like a pack of wolves. It was the
T18s and T19s
including Mr. Floppy Fin (
T19B
). Within minutes of their kill they had cleaned up the remains and headed north for the Strait of Georgia. We left them rounding East Point, traveling fast, gaining speed to 10 knots.

A
Waldron Island

two transient orcas
very close to shore near
Sandy Point
early this morning.

7 pm - Killer whales
are back!
Eagle Point
heading down island ranging from quarter mile to 1.5 miles offshore. Too far away to tell who's who but as I'm looking out, I can see at least 30+ spouts & surfacing whales spread out over a couple miles. Seriously, they are everywhere! I can see spouts about halfway to Discovery Island.

We live on
Stuart Island
(West side) watching
~ 5 whales
headed north on Sunday at

12:06PM
and were sad to see a vessel headed south that was a white pleasure craft fiberglass boat 30+ft with in board motors and a black canvas top- dingy covering the name. This vessel drove right into the whales ( never slowed down) such that they needed to swim under the vessel. Multiple whale watching craft were near the site of this happening floating at a respectful distance and seemed that their presence should have provided awareness of the whales nearby.

2 Orcas
sighted this morning swimming north along
Smugglers Cove
, Mitchell Point (west side of San Juan Is.) shoreline at about

6:45am
. I saw them too late to note markings or take photos. From what I've been told, they may have been K Pod, based upon their route so close to shore.
