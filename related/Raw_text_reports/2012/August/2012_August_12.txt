Orca Sightings for August 12, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
(
4:45 pm local) and again
on Aug. 20, 2012
(
3:00 pm local) a family of
three killer whales
were spotted in a small bay of
Kodiak Island, Alaska
. The bay had a run of Chum and Pink Salmon plus a few Harbor Seals. 152 deg 57' W. Long X 57 deg 30' 5" N Lat is close to the bay called Hidden Basin. They were a male, a female and a baby. They just circled the bay (a basin) once each time they were in. The attached pictures hopefully show identifying marks. I have other pictures showing other info if anyone would be interested. We sometimes get sightings at other times of the year.

Members of the
resident orca group K-pod
were close by, including
K-27 "Deadhead"
feeding by
False Bay
(48째28'316N, 123째05'047W). Three other members of the K13 matriline were around, including a male, likely K-25 "Scoter". At one point we witnessed SIX BREACHES in a row! What a sight.

Hell of a day! We met up with the
T36s, T37s, and T99s in Sansum Narrows
, between Maple Bay and Crofton around
11am
. They were very active at the surface for over 30 minutes, pec slapping, tail slapping, and even some breaching from the younger animals in the group (
T36B1 and T99C
). In the afternoon, they were still within the Salt Spring Island area of the Gulf Islands, this time off the northern tip of Secretary Island at approx.
15:00. Continuing with the trend from the morning, they were very "playful" at the surface. They made at least one kill during this time, as the gulls began to congregate overhead, and the orcas converged into a cluster to rip apart their prey.

We followed some of the
Js
north this
morning and afternoon
. Then this evening the
Ks
showed up in Boundary Pass. Wow!

Pretty awesome sunset tonight, complete with whales!
K-Pod
and half of
J-Pod
headed south past
Lime Kiln
right as the sun was going down. Despite reports of a superpod, Ls were no where in sight! Mistaken report?

By the time we reached the whales today, near
Saturna Island
(Canada), people had lined up along the shoreline waiting for their chance to see the
Southern Residents
. It was
six members of J pod
slowly moving north in
Boundary Pass
headed for the Strait of Georgia (48째45.88N 123째04.69W). In the mix we found
Hy'Shqa (J37)
and her newborn
J49
, along with Grandma
Samish (J14)
and the 20 year-old orphan from Lpod,
Onyx (L87)
. The group appeared to be resting, staying fairly close to the shoreline, synchronizing their breaths and dives. When we came back for our second visit the group of whales began lobtailling and playing around with one another. We then headed home with news of K pod entering the area.
