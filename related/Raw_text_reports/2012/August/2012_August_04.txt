Orca Sightings for August 4, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

5:00 pm
a report of a group of
five transient (mammal hunting) killer whales, the T30s
, were sighted
near Victoria
British Columbia Canada. The group traveled at high speed south of Victoria towards Race Rocks Pacific Ecological reserve, last sighted at Beacher Bay, a famous harbor seal haul out. The T30s are comprised of an older Matriarch T30 (estimated birth 1967), her son T30A (born 1986), daughter T30B (born 1993), her calf T30B1, and possible female T30C (born 2005). T30A the only full grown male of the group and is very distinguishable from other males by his dorsal fin which tilts slightly to the left. Within the last year T30B gave birth to her first calf T30B1 who already has a distinguishing little notch at the base of the dorsal fin. This group has been seen feeding on harbor seals near shore within 200m around haulouts. They sometimes travel with companions like T46B and calf T46B2 and the T19s. Sightings of this group have become more frequent over the last 7 years Let us just hope we get more opportunities with this amazing group of animals.

This
humpback
was later identified as
#409
. We counted almost 20 breaches in addition to peck slaps and great fluke-up dives! We encountered the humpback near
Andrews Bay
on the west side of San Juan Island.

From
Lime Kiln State Park
we watched a
humpback
in resting mode traveling fairly slowly northbound in
Haro Strait
. Suddenly she/he breached and continued to breach (about 25 in all), pec slap, roll, and fluke diving. Spirits were with us all this beautiful sunny summer day!

One humpback
entertained many people today, with breach after breach after breach. She/he was a little north of
Lime Kiln
early this afternoon. No orcas, but this was a superb replacement!

We left Friday Harbor heading north with word of
a humpback whale
in the area. We spotted the distinct, 10 foot plus blow of a large humpback whale just off the west end of
Stuart Island
. It was traveling north east around Turn Point before making a b-line across the US boarder into Canadian waters. It surfaced two, three, up to four times before living up to it's name and "humping," waving it's fluke in the air before it disappeared and was down for about three to four minutes. We watched this for a while until the pattern was broken when the whale decided to lunge out of the water! It was awesome!

A
minke whale
surfaced at
Salmon bank
. This one had a nick in the middle of its dorsal fin.
