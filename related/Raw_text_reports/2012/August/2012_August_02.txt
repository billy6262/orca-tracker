============================================================

Entry 1:
The OCNMS R/V TATOOSH spotted
a large pod of orca whales numbering between 20 to 30 animals
. Their location was
23 nm west - northwest (WNW) of Cape Alava
(the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states) and they were traveling in a SSE direction.

Five days and no SRKW's to been seen. Today, an early morning report of a
humpback
sighting in
Haro Strait
, and eventual confirmed sightings
south of Eagle Point
, brought us to American Camp by
1:30. When we arrived at the pullout above South Beach we watched
a lone humpback
surface in cycles of 5-6 times then deep diving for 4-6 minutes (love those flukes). We saw a couple of breaches, but it mostly zig zagged back and forth in this pattern in and around Salmon Bank until we left at

5:00pm
. There were also 3 minke in the same general area during this time. We returned to
Cattle Point at
7:15pm
, the
humpback
had moved northbound up
San Juan Channel
, hugging
Lopez
, and milling in the kelp. It quickly turned and made its way back around Cattle Point towards Salmon Bank, again zig zagging, deep diving, and one last breach. We left at

9:00pm
, with the humpback still in that general area.
