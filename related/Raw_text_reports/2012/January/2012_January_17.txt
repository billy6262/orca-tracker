TRANSIENT ORCAS OFF
MOSS LANDING
:
CA51s and the CA140
s have returned home to Monterey Bay! Report via Orca Network: Capt. Jim Davis of Blue Ocean Whale Watch and Captain Michael Sack from Sanctuary Cruises photographed this group of 10 whales outside Moss Landing harbor late yesterday afternoon.
We saw them on
January 1,
January 2,
January 4, and
January 10 from our ACSA/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project at Pt, Vicente; sightings stretched from just south of Malibu to Long Beach.
January 3 they were off Dana Point. They were (likely) off Zuma Beach on
January 11 (no pics), off Avila Beach
January 15, and yesterday back in Monterey, near Moss Landing. WOW! Hopefully they will pay a visit to southern California again soon; we REALLY enjoyed it!

Entry 2:
*
Capt. Jim Davis of Blue Ocean Whale Watch was
outside Moss Landing
harbor late this
afternoon
and snapped a few photos of the
killer whales
that were milling about near the mile-marker buoy. He said they were surfacing infrequently, spread out from one another, and changing their direction often but generally staying in the same area outside the harbor. While we had heard from a fisherman coming in from a trip that there was supposedly an attack on a gray whale, they could not find any evidence of the attack. Looks to me like the CA51s and maybe the CA50s but I can't tell much from the photos (all taken by Jim).

Moss Landing, Monterey Bay, CA: Bill Schlegelmilch, a crabber, called Orca Network at

12:31 with a report of 3 to 6 orcas about 2 miles out from Moss Landing
today, Jan. 17. They were travelling a 210 degree course. Not certain about male dorsal, but he saw the saddle patches. He saw them at
10:15 and
12:00 noon.

9:42 am -
While talking on the phone, I was surprised to notice a blow a short distance off the Westview ferry teminal in
Powell River BC
. Quickly looking through binoculars, a few Orca appeared briefly. Doing long dives and surfacing very briefly, there were only a few chances to really look at them. There were
approximately 7 Orca counted
, but there may have been more. They including at least one large male and one, possibly two juveniles. After a couple of quick breaths they disappeared for quite a while and popped up again quite a distance off before the next breath.
By
9:50 am they were Southbound
well past the viewpoint and almost to Grief Point and out of sight.
