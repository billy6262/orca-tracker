Orca Sightings for January 27, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'd like to report that yesterday, while we were water monitoring, we spotted
one (possibly two) younger [humpback] whales on Dabob Bay in Hood Canal
. They were in the north estuary section near Broadspit (off Taylor Shellfish Lab) and looked like they were hanging out for a while.

Humpbacks in Hood Canal since 1972 -I looked at my old fishing records from 1972 to 1982 and noted that we had Humpbacks in Hood Canal 3 times. Resident Orca on a fairly regular basis from late Sept. to Nov. Two or 3 times a season and as far up as Hoodsport.
