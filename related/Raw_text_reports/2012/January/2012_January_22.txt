I just moved here so im not sure if this is noteworthy or not but i definitely saw
a whale of some sort
while running along
Alki beach (West Seattle)
probably between
3 and 4 in the afternoon
. I didn't see it blow any water but it came up and i saw its big ol tail go up in the air as other went down for a dive. I didn't ever see its front so i couldn't tell if it was am orca. It did it twice and i didn't see it again. It must've swam a long was because it was not far from shore.
