Orca Sightings for January 12, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amy Carey called to relay a sighting of
a large whale
, not orcas,
off Vashon Island, just SW of Alki Pt
., heading generally south around

8:30 am
. Three blows were seen. It's not known i this was a minke or possibly a gray whale, or another exotic whale that shouldn't be here, like the Bryde's whales seen last year.
