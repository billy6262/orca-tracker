Orca Sightings for January 30, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thank you for the wonderful Way of Whales workshop. I have to share the final flourish on the weekend. My father Malcolm, on his last leg home to Victoria on Monday morning, saw from BC Ferries Coastal Renaissance
at Active Pass a group of six orcas heading east into the Strait of Georgia
. The thrill was greater having spent Saturday in Coupeville learning more about these incredible creatures.
