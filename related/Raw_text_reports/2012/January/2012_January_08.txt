Orca Sightings for January 8, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
After a heads up from Jeanne, we went out with Jim Maya on Peregrine this afternoon and had an encounter with
four transients (T68, T68A, T75B, and T75B1) at the east end of Spieden Channel
. We caught the tail end of them beating up a Steller sea lion before they dispatched it and fed and milled in that same general area until we left them around 1610.

We got a call from Kim and Karl at Lonesome Cove this afternoon, telling us that there were
Orcas in Speiden Channel,
3:30ish
. It was the
T68s
. The male is
T68a
. The other two were
T75b and T75b1
, according to David Elifrit. Great news. Love an Orca phone call. We got there in about thirty minutes. Dave Elifrit, from the Center for Whale Research and Jeanne Hyde, our naturalist were on the boat (Jeanne Hyde's Blog). Four transient Orcas were attacking a Steller Sea Lion. About 20 minutes the attack continued and then a long period of nothing. The rest of the time they fed on the Steller right off Green Point, Speiden Island. It's amazing to watch nature in all its variations!
