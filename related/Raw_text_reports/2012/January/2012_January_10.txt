Orca Sightings for January 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
On 10 January, the same day that we had the
CA51s and the 140s
off the
Palos Verdes Peninsula
, the Condor Express saw a single killer whale about two miles north of
Santa Cruz Island in the Santa Barbara Channel
. It was a young male, when we get the photos to Alisa we will let you know who it was.

ORCAS off Pt. Vicente!
1 mile out - headed out/east!! I got on these whales for about an hour (on the Christopher). We saw
10 orcas
- the same ones that were spotted last week: the
CA51s (7 whales) and the CA140s (3 whales)
. We left them about
3.5 miles off the Los Angeles lighthouse
just before 5pm, headed ESE toward Dana Point. Two briefly porpoised; some made a few close passes near our boat. One the earlier trip they had been breaching, spyhopping, lobtailing, apparently throwing prey (sea lions) around, playng in kelp, and vocalizing!

I just watched the
orcas
celebrate a kill for well over an hour. Milling with spyhops, breaches, lobtails, headstands and tail kicks. Alisa Schulman-Janiger already identified them as
the CA140s and CA51s
. The Voyager IV Excursions, LLC got on them also.
