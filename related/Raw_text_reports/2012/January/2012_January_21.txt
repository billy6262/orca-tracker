Orca Sightings for January 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Tom and Jane Cogan, Jeanne Hyde and I were able to see some members of
J Pod
. We got the first call from them at

11:29 AM
. I looked out from our front porch and there they were! Looked like residents from a distance. Jeanne met me at Snug Harbor, and we took off in the Peregrine. Within ten minutes, in very big seas, we spotted them and confirmed that they were members of J Pod. Not all of them were there, and J48, the new calf was absent, sadly. We never did see the rest of J Pod. Check out Jeanne's blog for id's (see below). We see J Pod every month of the year, but not on a regular basis, until the summer when they know all the tourists will be out in force, and they can people watch. Then they are here most every day. Salmon runs have a role in their appearances also.

Orcas
slowly headed north along the
west side of San Juan Island
. Saw the first orcas at about

11:25 am
, with more trickling past until shortly after noon. Some milling, some foraging. Preliminary ID suggests J pod. At first we thought the orcas might be transients, but they looked like they were going after fish. However, after seeing nearly 20 orcas trickle past, and confirming that
J28
was in the mix, we knew we had some Js. The orcas were pretty far from shore, and the seas were getting worse by the minute.

12:02 PM
, on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered the
J16s, J11s, J17s, and J22s
just south of
Kellet Bluff
, northbound (north of San Juan Island, up Haro Strait). The encounter ended at

12:45
as the whales were abeam of Battleship Island, heading north toward Turn Pt. Here's a list of the whales we saw:
J27, J31, J39, J22, J32, J34, J38, J17, J28, J35, J44, J46, J47, J16, J26, J36 and J42
. I'll post pictures on my blog.

At least one male orca
is off
Depoe Bay OR
now (

9:45am
) heading south. Linda and others at the Whale Center saw the dorsal several times, about 1/2 mile to a mile from shore in 15' waves. There could have been more between the whitecaps.
