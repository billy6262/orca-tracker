Orca Sightings for January 26, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
My daughter and I observed one solitary
gray whale about 100yds NW of the Edmonds fishing pier at
3:45pm
this afternoon. I heard it behind me first, spun around and saw its broad back submerge, then it surfaced two more times before disappearing. About 5 minutes later saw it blow twice, several hundred yards off to the southwest. Brief but really exciting. It was such a nice afternoon to be outside for a bit, and the sighting made it extra special.
