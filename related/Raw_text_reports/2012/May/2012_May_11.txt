Orca Sightings for May 11, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I got a killer whale report from one of our fishery observers from Friday. They reported seeing
5 or 6 killer whales
, one described as "huge" with a 4 or 5 foot fin. They were spotted about 3 to 4 miles offshore at N 48.06 which is
offshore of Lake Ozette
(south of Sand Point). Credit to Ian Franco, our observer, for sending in the report and photo.
