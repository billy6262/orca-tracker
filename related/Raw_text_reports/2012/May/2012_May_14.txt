Orca Sightings for May 14, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just off the Shimada and while I was out there I took these shots. There were
3 whales spotted about 15 miles west of Pt Reyes CA

Norm at KOMO TV called (

2:35 pm
) from a chopper above
Jetty Island
, just off Everett, saying they were watching
a gray whale
stirring up mud in shallow water.

As we reached
Hein Bank
, coordinates 48 degrees 20.80 minutes N, 123 degrees 04.089 minutes W, we slowed to almost a stop. Minke whales are difficult to spot because they have a low blow, a small dorsal fin, and if there are waves they tend to block our view. But, we definitely had no trouble today as
a minke
surfaced right ahead of our boat! And because the water was so flat we saw more of the body than I'd ever seen before. We spent some time watching that lone minke surface and dive methodically around our boat before heading back towards Salmon Bank. Again, it didn't take very long before we spotted two more minke whales! (Coordinates 48 degrees 24.53 minutes N, 122 degrees 59.06 minutes W). Their blows were audible and their smooth, rounded backs sliced through the glassy water again and again, keeping us mesmerized.
