Orca Sightings for May 22, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
9 am - While looking for grays this
morning
, we were surprised to find a group of
approx. 7 transients, all females and calves, just north of the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry lanes
. They milled around for a while, looked like they were hunting successfully but we never could see exactly what they had. We left them about halfway between the mainland and Whidbey, heading northwest-ish towards Brighton Beach.

J pod
in its entirety (including L87 of course) reported near
Hein Bank
. When we arrived on scene, they were widely spread out, so much so that the only whales we could find were the
J22s with J32
. The four of them were not traveling in any direction, but instead milling in a tight cluster, likely catching salmon as we saw at least two bursts of speed at the surface. They would rise for 4-5 slow breaths at the surface, then disappear for 4-5 minutes. A few small spyhops here and there, but other than that, they seemed pretty preoccupied with chomping salmon below the waves.

The Beam Reach class spent the afternoon with
J-Pod milling around Salmon Bank and Hein Bank
. We caught up with the whales a little after noon where they were calling and clicking for about an hour! We left a focal group of about five members of J-pod around

3:30
today. On our return to Snug Harbor we happened to encounter more whales! The whales appeared to be in three focal groups spread out but we think they were heading north.

At

6:38 a.m. I heard a few very faint Resident calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophones
. At about
9 a.m. I spotted J Pod at Kellett Bluff
heading down island. Between

9:30 and
10:00 a.m. J pod whales passed Lime Kiln lighthouse
quickly. From then until about
3:00 pm they were off the west side of San Juan Island heading west slowly Then they turned around and at about

4:30 passed by Lime Kiln lighthouse heading up island
. For more of my encounters from today visit my blog: Whale of a Purpose.

We met up with
J22 Oreo and sons, with J28 Polaris and J46 Star
, not far from Salmon Bank in Haro Strait. The rest of the pod was spread out over a large area, like yesterday. Lots of tail-lobbing, pectoral slapping, rolls and spyhops. Seeing both the Ts and the residents was a real treat today!

We traveled around to the south end of the San Juan Island and found the
Resident Killer Whales about 2 miles southwest of Hein Bank
(48°22.25N, 123°06.56W). Everyone was mesmerized by
at least five members of J-pod
. The whales were initially very surface active: spy-hopping, breaching, tail slapping, and cartwheeling. They had short dive times and changed direction frequently. We took this opportunity to lower the hydrophone and listen to the whale vocalizations. AMAZING! The whales then appeared to enter a resting phase, as they lined up in a row and traveled slowly together. When it was time to leave the whales had increased their dive times and appeared to be traveling to the southwest.

4:30 pm -
We watched
a gray whale
approx. 5 minutes after we left the
Mukilteo
dock. It was on the right side of the boat and it was going the opp way towards Mukilteo. It may have turned up left towards Everett?
