Orca Sightings for May 30, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 24
*
J,K, pods in southern Haro Strait
(with photos)
Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Bender
Around
noon
we received reports of groups of whales heading
down Rosario Strait and at Hein Bank
. The reports said that all three pods were present, so we headed out in hopes of getting some follow up photos of new calf L119 who was seen for the first time the previous day. We departed Snug Harbor at
1:45 p.m. with overcast skies and light wind. We encountered whales about
2 miles west of Iceberg Point on Lopez Island
. The whales were spread out in singles and small groups milling and moving generally SW. Although L's had earlier been reported in the area, we only encountered mixed groups of J's and K's. We came across a few fun groups of socializing juveniles. They were rolling and tactile with a few sea snake appearances.
J39, J42, K34 and J45
were in the first group, joined briefly by
J40 and J41
. We left that group, thinking about heading home when we came upon another tight tactile group of juveniles.
K36, K37, K43 and K42
were milling and rolling around, heading out toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We ended the encounter about 10 miles west of
Cattle Point at
4:21 p.m
. returning to Snug by 5 p.m. Whales photographed:
J8, J14, J17, J19, J26, J28, J36, J39, J40, J41, J42, J44, J45, J47, K12, K14, K25, K26, K27, K34, K36, K37, K42, K43, K44, and L87

2 recent reports of likely the same group of KWs heading north on 30 May: At
1055 hrs
, 41.47014 -124.06633 which is Carruther's Cove at the north end of Gold Bluff beach,
Prairie Creek State Park (50 miles north of Eureka
and 25 miles south of Crescent City CA), four biologists observed
four killer whales
traveling slowly north, 75 m offshore.
Then in the evening, around
1800
the keepers of the lighthouse at
Crescent City
saw
four KWs
slowly traveling north close to shore, watched them for over a half an hour. In both sightings no males were described, only similar sized medium females, no calves.

1:30 and
2:00 PM
a
small pod of orcas
was spotted about 1/4 mile off
Heceta Head in central Oregon
. The pod consisted of 1 male and 4 to 6 females/juveniles. They circled the same spot with occasional breaching of a juvenile. The pod was circled by a USCG HH-45 for several minutes.

2:00 pm
on Maya's Westside Charters we encountered J
pod, Onyx L-87 and the rest of the K pod whales
as they headed west along the bottom end of
Lopez and San Juan Island
. Many were in small groups showing playful surface behaviors. Pictures on my blog post from that day are at: Whale of A Purpose.

Members of
J-pod, K-pod, and L-Pod
where traveling together again today out in Rosario Strait just southwest of
Lopez Island
at approximately

1:00 PM
; coordinates 48°24.051N 122°50.23W. Within a few minutes of reaching the area, the Sea Lion (our boat) was surrounded by whales on all sides! It didn't matter in which direction we looked everyone was bound to see the whales surface. And man did it seem like they were in their realm!! We saw almost every behavior possible; from spyhopping to lobtailling to pectoral slapping to breaching. We even got so see a few calves rolling around belly up and wrestling with one another. Just adorable! Once we saw this behavior we immediately dropped the hydrophone and listened in. They were vocalizing as one would expect, with such a big group, chattin' up a storm. The crew and passengers really appeared to be beside themselves listening in and watching an entirely different community communicate and move as one. Today it really struck home that this world is not solely ours, rather we share it with many other amazing creatures.
