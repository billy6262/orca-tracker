Orca Sightings for May 26, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Maya's Charters we arrived on scene at

2:30
. Transients
T18, T19, T19B and T19C
were heading east in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
. When we returned at about 5 p.m. these whales had reached Haro Strait and headed north.
On Maya's Charters we arrived on scene at
noon
. Transients were heading north at Barnes and Clark islands.
T37, T37A1, T36, T36B, T36B1, T99, T99B, T99C
. These are the same whales who were seen near Victoria throughout the prior day.

Encounter # 21
*
T19's off Henry Island
Observers: Ken Balcomb
Around
6:15 PM, Ken heard Jim Maya and Spencer on the VHF talking about a male and a female (presumably killer whales) somewhere between
Kellett Bluff and Battleship Island
. At

6:34 PM
, he cast off in "Shachi" to check out the sighting report, and at

6:53 PM T19 and T19B
were encountered about one mile south of
Stuart Island
. The whales were headed northwest toward Turn Point in plodding fashion, with the male (T19B) taking egular but long dives. The female (mum T19) behaved more cryptic and less regular in her dives before crossing to mid-strait and joining with her other offspring, T19C, who appears to be "sprouting", i.e., showing sign of maturing with allometric growth of the dorsal fin. There had been four whales reported, but it seems that this might be explained by mum alternately swimming with her sons that were about one half mile apart as they headed northwest. They rounded Turn Point and headed
into Boundary Pass at
7:13 PM
, altering course slightly to north toward Blunden Island before the encounter ended at
7:20 PM near the Canada border. No predation was observed or suspected during this brief encounter at the end of a beautiful day in the Pacific Northwest. Two by two, the pelagic cormorants were returning to the ledge at Turn Point, and the osprey stood guard at its nest at Kellett Bluff as the sun was setting.

6+ transients 5nm east of
Thrasher Rock
(Southern tip of Gabriola Island near Nanaimo), heading NW. When we arrived on scene, we encountered
a female with a young calf, its skin still dark orange
. The mother appeared to be
T65
, but no confirmation was made on scene, as the mother/calf pair quickly changed direction and headed in toward the shore. This left us with a group of 4 transients several hundred yards out from the mother/calf. These four animals (which were identified as
T65A, T65A2, and two others
, IDs still pending) grouped up and spread apart at least twice as we watched them for 40 minutes, and at one point, converged into a small milling cluster, possibly having killed something. After that, they began to travel more rapidly NW in a line, almost porpoising but not quite.

Point Roberts, about
7:30pm, Orcas heading across Strait of Georgia
toward Galliano Island. Beautiful calm evening, whales were moving fast, playful, spectacular !

We were on our way to see the whales that were spotted in the San Juan Islands when a fisherman reported seeing some Orca around Gabriola Island. We changed course and within 40 minutes we found the group of
8 animals about 3 miles offshore of Gabriola
. It was a mix of a couple different groups and they were spread but we did ID
T65A and T36A with T36A1 and, what looked like,a new calf! (T36A2)?
It was a perfect day as we followed them west and great to see a new addition to the transient population.

Chatted to a lady at Mutiny Sands, Whidbey, this afternoon - she said she saw
seven orcas in Admiralty Inlet
. A young couple had been following them down the island (so traveling south), and the whales were 'playing' in the wake from ship.

Transients Orcas and Summer weather! Fantastic day on the water: treated to clear skies, summery temps, and a stunning view of Mt. Baker, we traveled north out of Friday Harbor, around the north side of Orcas Island, until catching up with
Transient Orcas on the north side of Lummi Island around
1:45 p.m.
Counts varied, depending on who you talked to, but we finally agreed on
7 total
. Latitude 48°44' Longitude 122°45'. As mesmerized as we were by the orcas, it was hard not to notice the many pairs of Rhinocerus Auklets calmly floating by, as well as a pair of Loons. Our day would not be complete without a Bald Eagle sighting, which was our final reward when a stately adult sailed overhead as we entered back into the marina.

11:55 - transients at Pt. Lawrence
(east side of Lopez Island) and also at Race Rocks. Whalepalooza!

A bunch of us were treated to
a small pod of orcas Sunday in Port Orford, OR
. We were just getting ready to go scuba diving when they appeared- they actually swam through our entry point. Not sure if there's a place to report Oregon sightings, but I figured I would start with your site. We talked to another diver who encountered what sounds like a different pod the day before while spearfishing an offshore reef near Port Orford- he described the whales as having noticeably tall dorsal fins, which doesn't sound like the ones we saw. Here's a link to the video I shot. I figured they were transients. Right after they left, three of us did a dive and when I surfaced there was a harbor seal hanging out a little closer to shore than I would have expected :) We were shocked that they came right into the exact area we use as an entry and exit for our dives- they never would have fit if it hadn't been high tide. It looked like one of them was skritching itself on the rocks. At that point I was trying to get some stills- I wish I had the presence of mind to run down there and dunk my camera for some close ups. Intellectually, we know that they don't bother humans but still- the idea of being in the water with them is thrilling and scary at the same time. I'm attaching links to 2 pics I put on facebook- one is about the only decent still I got, and the other shows just how constricted the area is that they went through.
