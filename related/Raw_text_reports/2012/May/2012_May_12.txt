T102 and 5 others

heading north.

At least
two groups of transients
were sighted moving north, northwest through
Porlier Pass
(north end of Galiano Island) about

2:30 pm
. We caught up with
T87, possibly T90, and one other female with a calf
(appeared to be at least 2 years old). Further off the Valdez Island shoreline was
T102
with at least 5 others, including two younger juveniles. It was frustrating to not be able to ID the younger animals and females! They continued to make their way north up the
Strait of Georgia
, taking steady long dives and surfacing in a scattered formation. There was some predation going on, because when we arrived on scene the gulls were hovering around and picking yummy bits of flesh off the surface. Two roaming gangs of transients out and about today, each at the polar opposite ends of the islands! They were covering all their bases it seems!

The Captain received word that Transient Orca Whales were around, but we would need to boat at least an additional 30 minutes to get there. Off we went again. We arrived on scene at Lat. 48.12.57 - Long. 123.15.29 (8-10 miles
NW of Dungeness Spit
). At first we did not see anything, then after 10 minutes - whale breath and dorsal fins. We counted
6 Transient Killer Whales
. There was not a pattern to their movement and they did not appear to be hunting.

The whales encountered while on Maya's Westside Charters, in the afternoon from
3 to 4 pm
, were
T10, T10B, T10C, T26, T26A, T77, T77B, T77C and T77D
. We were not far from
Dungeness Spit
. When first arriving on scene they were in three groups. Eventually they came together and began moving slowly northeast. We left them heading in that direction at
4:00 p.m.

Sighted
2 Minke whales
traveling together. They were traveling east through the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
and made a clear direction change to NE at eastern bank.

9 am -
While underway towards our fishing hole we spotted what appeared to be
a minke whale
porpoising in front of the boat. Just SE of
Cattle point
.

Susan Stedman We watched
3 grays all weekend long around Priest Point, north of Everett
. They're still hanging around!
*
Gray whale
surfacing as it moved west to east along southern tip of
Fort Casey beach
. Continued east through Admiralty Inlet toward Greenbank area till out of sight. Sighted between

11:30 am and 12 noon
.

Minkes
do not spend much time at the surface at all - so one must keep their eyes moving over the water alert to the small dorsal fin. We stayed in the area about Â½ an hour to watch them surface 3 times. We were at Lat.48.21.9 - Long.122.56.72 (a few miles
south of Cattle Pass
).
Naturalist Colleen, San Juan Safaris

We got really lucky just as we reached Turn Point,
a humpback whale
was spotted north of
East Point
! It was decision time; continue our course, or extend our trip and go for it. We decided to go for it and headed further north. And was it worth it! The humpback whale blew magnificently in the distance. We watched as it surfaced a few times before flashing its fluke in a fluke up dive.
