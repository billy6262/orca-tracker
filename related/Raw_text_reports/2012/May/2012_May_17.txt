Orca Sightings for May 17, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a message from Mike Sullivan of Bainbridge Island, WA, reporting seeing some splashes and small dorsal fins from the
Seattle to Bainbridge ferry, at about
3:15 pm
. He was watching what appeared to be
1 - 3 orcas
, 100 - 150 yards to the north of the ferry, splashing and swimming toward Seattle.
With no other sightings of orcas, but some reports of porpoises in the area, these may have been porpoises.
