Orca Sightings for May 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We met
J-pod northwest of Point Roberts
. They were very spread out; we could see a lot of fins off in the distance while we enjoyed a visit with
J2 Granny, J8 Speiden, L87 Onyx, and J17 Princess Angeline and family
. The youngsters were doing lots of spyhopping.

Victoria Clipper III found
a single gray whale southeast of Gedney Island about
9:00 am
, heading toward the Everett waterfront. We didn't get a good enough look for an ID.

I saw a pod of
killer whales
off
Maury Island
at
7pm
. There were
about 8-10
I believe. I watched them for 90 minutes till darkness took over. They were heading south from Pt. Robinson to Tacoma at first. They came back and stayed off Manzanita (entrance to Quartermaster Harbor) for most of the time. I watched them from my home in Redondo Beach. This is the first time I've seen them off Redondo in my 55 years living here. I did see a big Gray Whale out front of my house about 4 weeks ago. I've seen the Orca's off Friday Harbor a number of times I've been up there. They really put on a great show. "Happy Whale Sighting".

Today we traveled north into Canadian waters and caught up with about
7 or 8 members of J-Pod just off Point Roberts
; coordinates: 48°56.97N, 123°10.25W. As we arrived on the scene the whales were quite spread out allowing guests to look in every direction and see at least one or two. A few members of the pod were lobtailing and a curious male even began spyhopping to check out the scene. It really was amazing to see just how large these animals can be with only half of their bodies rising above the surface. As we started heading back, we caught up with Western Prince who had 3 more members of J-pod traveling parallel to them. We got to ride alongside this group for a while longer, watching them rise and dive multiple times.

Many loud
calls on the Orcasound hydrophones at
04:11 am
(5 km north of Lime Kiln) over noise of two nearby tug boats. Mostly hearing S1 calls with occasional S10, but no echolocation clicks.
Jeanne Hyde observed loud calls at Lime Kiln at

3:38 am.
I heard S1 calls loud, then fading at
3:44. It's been quiet since. Earlier, more distant calls were heard from around midnight to
1:30 a.m. A recording of that call sequence is here.
