Orca Sightings for May 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jay Lark called from the
Depoe Bay
, Oregon Whale Center (saw a poster) to report
a killer whale 1.5 miles up the Umpqua River
at Winchester Bay, swimming lazily upriver, at
2 pm
. It had a large dorsal fin.

While camping in our RV @ the
Winchester Bay Oregon
RV resort, we spotted
an Orca
heading East toward Salmon Harbor. The dorsal fin was at least 3'-4' high and very straight. It looked like he was feeding as there was a very large splash followed by a lot of thrashing. He then turned around and headed out across the bar. The sighting was @

2:30 pm
. We could not identify any other markings.

Across from
Cattle Point
(south end of San Juan Island) we reached our first hot spot for wildlife viewing. We didn't have to go very far, about 500 yards, and we saw
two Minke Whales
! The water couldn't have been better for viewing today! The Minkes broke through what appeared to be glass. They were so smooth in their actions and so flawless. Fortunately, we were able to cut the motor and stay with the Minkes for a while, it appeared they were enjoying their situation and had no intentions on leaving.
