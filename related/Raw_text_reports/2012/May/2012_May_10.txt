3 orcas
heading north along the west shorelines of
DeCourcy and Mudge Islands
(about ten miles south of
Nanaimo
). Looked like 2 adults and a calf. Dorsal fins appeared small and curved. One adult had a gray saddle behind it's fin. They appeared to be feeding off Mudge Island, then started to head south, passing just to the east of Round Island.
