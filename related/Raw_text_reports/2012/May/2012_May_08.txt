Orca Sightings for May 8, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Residents are being seen in all directions! We looped around
San Juan
to the west side and were able to catch up with four individuals from
J-Pod
. There was one large male, a female, and two calves. As we traveled with the group along the shoreline, just past East Point (Saturna Island), they milled around, and the calves began breaching a few times here and there! After about 15 minutes they changed direction and immediately gained speed heading north. We got to travel with them for a few more miles and in that time, the large male even breached!

Whales at
Eagle Point
heading North on SJI. I saw two, but they were close to shore and trees were blocking part of the view.
