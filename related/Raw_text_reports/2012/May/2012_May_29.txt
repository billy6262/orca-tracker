Orca Sightings for May 29, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Encounter # 23

J,K,L pods in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
(with photos)
Observers: Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Barbara Bender
After receiving several reports of lots of whales heading in near Sooke, CWR staff left in Orca at 1055 to intercept them after topping off with fuel in Roche Harbor. At
1206, we arrived on scene and found J and K pods plus L87 and the L2's
in a tight formation heading slowly east
off the Victoria waterfront
(48 21.757N 123 26.811). We left this group at 1217 still west of Trial Island to check out the rest of L pod who were also heading east about two miles to the south.
We got on L pod at 1225 as they traveled slowly east in two tight groups loosely separated with the L12 subpod being slightly behind the rest of the L's. We were able to confirm a report from earlier in the day that
L77 had a new calf. L119
would be L77's second known calf. Her first, L114, was born in early 2010 but was only seen once before it disappeared.
L90
survived the winter and was seen traveling with the L26's after her late summer 2011 health scare although she still seems to have a stiff surfacing motion. However,
noticeably missing from L pod was L5, an estimated 47 year old female, and L12, an estimated 78 year old female
. We will wait for a couple more good encounters with L pod before writing them off to make sure they were not just missed. If these two remain missing, the Southern Resident population will have lost four whales this year so far since L112 washed up dead on the Washington Coast in
February 2012, including J30 who has not been seen since last December. With the loss of four whales and the addition of L119,
the Southern Resident population currently stands at 85
.
We stayed with L pod as they continued slowly east in a resting formation until 1355 when we headed back to the J's and K's who had just passed through Enterprise Channel between Trial Island and the south tip of Vancouver Island. The J's, K's, L2's, and L87 were milling easterly in a tight group in the tidal slop off the Golf course at Gonzales Point. We photographed the whales in this group until 1500 when we left them to find the L pod calf again. L pod woke up, sped up, and spread out as they approached Seabird Pt. on Discovery Island. We followed a few spread out L pod whales, including L77 and L119, as they headed east across Haro Strait in lumpy seas toward San Juan Island. Most of the L's were pointed toward False Bay or further south and we left them around 1620 and began bouncing north toward home, photographing a few spread out whales along the way. The last whales we found were a loose group including
J27, J31, J39, J28, J46, J22, and J34
that surfed north in three foot seas. We ended the encounter at 1642 off the west side of San Juan Island (48 29.118N 123 08.134W) and were back at Snug Harbor at 1705.
The
J's, K's, L2's, and L87 traveled north fast past CWR at 1805
and the rest of
L pod stayed to the south and presumably headed back west
out the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the night.

We spent some time with
J & K pod
at the Victor Hotel buoy (south of Ogden Point in
Victoria
); they were traveling close together, lots of fins in the air at once, and looked like they were covering ground--just surfacing and breathing, no fin slapping or other playful behaviors. Identified
J2, J8, J17s, J22s, K 21, K40, and L87
for sure...many other whales there who I'm not as familiar with and weren't posing for the cameras as much. Granny is looking great, it has been so nice to see her over the past couple weeks!

From the Center for Whale Research -
the birth of a new L pod calf, L119, is confirmed! Born to 25 year old L77, Matia, L119 is L77's 2nd calf
, though her 1st calf, L114, born in 2010, died the same year. We are hopeful for the future of L119, every whale addition makes a huge difference for the survival of the endangered Southern Resident orcas. The encounter summary and photos of the new calf will be posted tomorrow on the
Center for Whale Research website
. Further encounters will be needed to determine whether all members are present.

Residents are back!! Nice to see them home and looked like all of them! We spent most of our time around
Trial Island
with a mix of
J's K's and L's
resting. I heard there was another group offshore with a new calf (L Pod). We had
K21, K40, J27, L78, L100
and may more. Awesome day!

Super Pod! We traveled all the way to Victoria BC to see three different pods of Southern Resident Killer Whales. When multiple pods of whales come together it is called a super pod! Members of the
J- and K-pods were traveling together
, moving through Enterprise Channel
between Victoria and Trial Island
(48 24.46N, 12318.64W), with individuals from
L-pod roughly 1 mile offshore
. The whales were traveling in an easterly direction. We were all captivated by the whales. At times over 20 whales were seen surfacing, including a number of mature males. Super pods only occur a handful of times during the season; such a treat to see so many whales together! A truly AMAZING day out here in the San Juan Islands!
