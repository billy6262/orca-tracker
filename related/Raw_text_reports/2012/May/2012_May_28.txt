============================================================

Entry 1:

3 orcas
about a mile north of

May 28 at

9:30 am.
He saw the poster with the number to call.

We encountered a
lone gray whale
just off the Edmonds ferry dock as we were heading home on Monday night. It was northbound, a little before
7 pm
. The water was too choppy to get a good look for an ID, but I wonder if it was the same one we saw in the same area a couple weekends ago?

Encounter # 22 - T10's in Haro Strait. Observers: Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit and Erin Heydenreich
We overheard a report of
Transients in Haro Strait
on the radio around

4:00 P.M.
We departed Snug at
4:10 p.m. and headed across Haro Strait toward Kelp Reef. We encountered the
T10's (T10, T10B and T10C)
in a loose group heading slowly NW. Within a half hour they spread out and were heading up Haro Strait close to Sidney Island. We left them at

5:10
still moving slowly NE. Whales photographed: T10, T10B and T10C
*
We had
T10's
today from about
1630 to 1720 near Kelp Reef
. Supercat spotted them first. It was also reported that about
24 T's in several groups were up near Porlier Pass
, and we are waiting reports of who they might have been. Simon says he saw the
T124's
up there today, but could not find the others.

Maybe

4:00 pm - orca sighting georgia straight
, Orca pod,
at least 3, maybe 4
, 1 larger and longer with larger fin (probably male). Latitude 49 degrees 28 minutes north, Longitude 123 degrees 55 minutes west. Travelling north between Halfmoon Bay on the Sunshine Coast of BC and Merry Island...casual surface travel, cruising. We viewed them from our cottage on Halfmoon Bay high bank. Unusual for this area! Amazing....

From Bellhouse Park on Galiano Island today around

2:30
, we watched
2 whales leisurely feed off the east entrance to Active Pass
. These were definitely not orcas. From the whale watching we have done in Hawaii, these behaved like humpbacks. They were big, slow moving, small dorsal fin, did tail slaps and a half body breach (Gary saw white splotches on the flecked underbelly), rounded back before diving, raised tail on diving, large blows. Pretty exciting.
