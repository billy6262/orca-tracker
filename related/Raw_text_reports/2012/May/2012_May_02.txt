============================================================

Entry 1:
So excited...saw
a Gray Whale
this morning off the

7:00 am Clinton/Mukilteo Ferry
as we left the Clinton dock. It was heading south and along Columbia Beach. What a great way to wake up!

Sighted two
humpbacks
in Clover Pass near
Ketchikan, AK
at about
5PM
today. Looks like the whales have finally returned to Southeast Alaska.

Note: there were lots of humpbacks on the west side of Prince of Wales Island around
April 1, and in Sitka AK the next week
