8:10 a.m. -
I heard Resident
calls on Lime Kiln hydrophones
, but they didn't last very long. I located the whales as they were reaching the west side of San Juan Island from the west. As they came north starting at about

9:30, Granny J-2 and Spieden J-8 were in the lead with Onyx L-87
offshore from them. Granny and Spieden foraged as they passed they approached the lighthouse and a fish could be seen at the surface. The rest of Granny's group passed on through over an long period. Behind them were the K13s, the K12s and the K14s. Another long time period and the
J11s, J17s, J22s, K-40, K16, K35 and surprisingly the L2s - Grace -L-2, Gaia L-78 and Wave Walker L-88
. The last ones passed by the lighthouse at
12:15pm heading north. More of the encounter and pictures are on my blog - Whale of A Purpose.

10:32 - Echolocation clicks and J pod calls now on Lime Kiln hydrophones
... SRKW sounds were not heard earlier on Orcasound hydrophones to the north, so pod is likely heading north in
Haro Strait
this morning.
