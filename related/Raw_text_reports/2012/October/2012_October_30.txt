From the Queen of Burnaby ferry at about

3:35 pm
between
Little River and Texada Island several hundred Pacific white sided dolphins
seen in two groups some moving South and others moving North. Hard to judge numbers but the larger southbound group covered an area about 300 metres by fifty. Beautiful sight.
