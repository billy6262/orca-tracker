Orca Sightings for October 3, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a
humpback at
9:00
in the main basin of
Puget Sound
. We were in the SB traffic lanes abeam of Carkeek Park. The whale was clearly sighted and was traveling north. Couldn't tell the sex. Very big and dark colored. Blowing, but not playing.

We had been lucky to have seen many killer whales:
approx 25-35 orcas transiting Active Pass
, traveling very briskly towards the Fraser River
1700 hrs
. No ID as to pod.

They're baaaaacccckkkk. So nice to have the rezzies back in area! Whales all over and a couple large mixed groups. We spent most of our time with a group with about
20 animals
(mix of
J's and K's
).

The Center for Whale Research reports that members of
all three pods except the L12s and the L22s
went north up
Haro Strait
today, starting around
9 am
off the south end of San Juan Island. They took their time most of the way with a few bursts of speed, passing Turn Point at

4:30 pm
, headed NW up Swanson Channel. Yesterday afternoon the same whales were coming in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
