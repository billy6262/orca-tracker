Orca Sightings for October 6, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients T049's
yesterday by
Darcy Island
(I heard T036's also?),
6-8 whales
, beautiful views with glass-like conditions. Also we had a wonderful encounter with
Dall's porpoise
on the return trip, they make everybody feel happy! A branded
Steller sea lion
also at Whale Rocks - he was born at St. George Reef in California (the "Y" on his number was the giveaway clue).

3:00PM -
approximately
6 T's west of Kelp Reef
(48°30.86N, 123°16.48W) traveling south. Another busy day on the water with all the familiar faces of the Salish Sea. In addition to watching Transient Killer Whales south of D'arcy Island, British Columbia (48°30.86N, 123°16.48W), we also came across a lone
California Sea Lion
. He was floating with just his head, hind flippers, and one pectoral flipper out of the water, a strategy sea lions use to regulate their body temperature in these frigid 48°F waters. On our way home we picked up a large pod of
Dall's Porpoises
. When Captain Craig slowed the boat to 7 knots, we watched their "rooster tail" splashes as they turned to converge on our bow. We were all in awe as we observed their chunky bodies of solid muscle zig zag around our bow and then breach to the side for a quick breath before taking another pass across our wake. I could watch those critters all day! There were fewer
Steller's Sea Lions
hauled out on Whale Rocks today, but more were milling in the water. We were impressed by a few individuals that were breaching completely out of the water. As was the case for yesterday, the Transients we observed stayed in a tight, slow-moving formation as they performed approximately 5 minute foraging dives. We tried our best to parallel the group as they made their way in a southerly direction toward Victoria; however, after one long dive they popped up right alongside our boat. We shut down and listened to them breath and prepare for their next stealth dive.
