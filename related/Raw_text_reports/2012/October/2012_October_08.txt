Florian Graner and I departed Holmes Harbor just after 11 am and saw the first dorsals
south of Edmonds at about
12:30
. They were completely spread across Puget Sound, meandering and foraging as they moved slowly southward. The highlight was when 8 to 10 orcas surfed a large wake from a big container ship as it spread across the Sound. They were mostly submerged, just black and white forms through the watery lens, with just the tips of dorsals ripping the surface at great speed as they were propelled along, angling forward to maximize the rush. Further south we found that a few orcas, including baby
J49, had meandered into Elliot Bay
and seemed to like it there, maybe feasting on chum waiting for a good rain to head up the Duwamish River to spawn.

6:31 -
they're just passing the south end of
Blake Island
right now. Should be crossing the Fauntleroy ferry lane shortly in the setting sun. Epic. Although they are TEENY TINY from my house. I can still see them though!

Resident Orca
morning to sundown: First from Edmonds watched the orca mid channel
between Point No Point and Whidbey
, then moved to
Carkeek
, then
Golden Gardens
as we watched them foraging, breaching, porpoising, and meandering their way south down Puget Sound, past
Bainbridge and around Alki/Blake Island
on towards Vashon by sundown.

Saw
several orca
behind my house (just south of
Alki lighthouse in west seattle
) this evening around
5
, but there were likely more than that present (just not all surfacing at once). They were just west of weather watch park in West Seattle (4035 Beach Dr SW seattle WA). They swam around for a long time just north of blake island, but eventually
headed south towards Tacoma
. I saw them around

6:30-
7:30
this evening. They were probably feeding, as they hung around a long time in this area. A few breached (jumped out of the water), but mostly, they just porpoised occasionally in the area. Males?: I think so, but I am no expert. Definitely there were some with dorsal fins
*
much
*
larger than others.

I live at the USGS Station in
Fort Flagler State Park
at the north end of
Marrowstone Island
. A coworker and I spotted
a very large group of orcas traveling South
at little after
7 am.
They were traveling in two groups and we estimated
the total number to be around 60
but we weren't sure if it was one large spread out group, or two distinct groups. They were porpoising the entire time and had at least two babies that we could see as well as a few males. They were too far away to see any individual markings or to take photos. Orcas this far south in the sound are fairly rare, they're usually seen once or twice a year here at the station but never in such large numbers. Hope this info helps!

What a way to spend Canadian thanksgiving! We got an early report of
T's heading west along Valdes Island
. We headed up that way and a few miles east of
Ballenas Island, in the Strait of Georgia, we saw the T30's
. The water was so beautifully flat and the whales were traveling in a tight group. The whales were traveling about 8 knots for the last 20 minutes of our trip heading northwest! They were on a mission to get somewhere, I heard about an hour later they joined up with approximately 12 more whales. Nothing like flat seas and T's during the day and a turkey dinner at night.
