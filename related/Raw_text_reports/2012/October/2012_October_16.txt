We had
J's and K's (and of course L87)
travelling south in
Haro Strait
this
AM
, and it appears that they went out the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
in the
PM
. Methinks that they went up along the Sunshine coast and up around Hornsby Island before coming back this way. That has been a pattern around this time of year. Some Chum salmon up this way, but not lots. J49 looked good.
