Orca Sightings for October 13, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Spotted
orcas north of point no point
WA around
9 am
today. Not sure on the number but there were a few. They were feeding on salmon. Not sure of the direction of travel.

I was looking out from Beechyhead in
East Sooke
park (west of Victoria) today and saw
both humpbacks and killer whales
. At about 2PM one humpback breached just off shore and it seemed to have something red hanging from it's mouth. I took video and sent in some screen shots. A whale watching boat was near, they probably got good identification shots of the tail.

Large numbers of
L Pod plus K21
, were near
Beachy Bay headed east
. We even sighted several
humpbacks
but didn't have time to get close. What an afternoon! And as it turned out, early evening. A long, wonderful voyage.

My husband just saw some
orcas
between the
north end of Vashon and the south end of Blake Island
at around

12:30 PM
. Not sure which pod. They were headed south.

Our afternoon trip started out with the possibility of
two transients way out near Race Rocks
, west of Victoria. So we headed out across Haro Strait toward Victoria. At about ten miles before we get to Race, we hear over the radio that the other boats have lost the Ts. Ok! We slow down and we start scanning and slowly moving west. Then we hear that wonderful word. CONTACT! But the
Ts are 5 miles west of Race Rocks
. When you've come this far, you go for it. We reached the
Transient Orcas, about 10 of them
. Great! Even though they were elusive, the water was amazingly calm and the Olympics as a backdrop were stunning. Even for a short visit, lovely. Just before we leave to head back toward our dock, we heard that Residents have been sighted. How could we pass that up. It turns out to be large numbers of L Pod plus K21, were near Beachy Bay headed east (see above report). We even sighted
several humpbacks
but didn't have time to get close. What an afternoon! And as it turned out, early evening. A long, wonderful voyage.
