What an amazing, fantastic day Marilyn and I just had at
Bush Point
! We waited for over 2 hours, were freezing cold, wet and hungry. Had just decided to give up and head towards home unless we heard anymore reports. We were just a couple blocks up the hill where we could see south over the water...and there were blows galore! So we high tailed it back down to the beach. What a sight! Many, many orca spread out, at first circling and chasing fish. After about 15 minutes or so of that, there were still more coming from the south, and they continued to circle and feed. Soon, they apparently were feeling well fed enough to play around a bit. We started seeing many breaches all around and across the channel, some closer to us, some far over near the other side. And then, a tug boat came thru...suddenly there were at least 3 orca chasing and surfing the wake of the tug! One caught up to the tug, and was surfing not more than probably about 30 ft behind it! ...an amazing sight to see. We took photos, but haven't had a chance to download and see what we got. I did shot video of some of the surfing, but not sure how it will turn out.

Here's our "Orca report" just now from Sound Experience aboard the Schooner Adventuress! Crew report "We are having an epic Member Transit so far! Just saw
Orcas off Point No Point
(everywhere!). They were flipping tails, spy hopping and one was rolling in the water. Seven or eight in total, and even some little ones! Then it hailed and the wind came up. Will post photos as soon as possible!"

John Rogstad with WA State Ferries called relaying a report of
orcas off the Kingston ferry dock

Dorsals in front of
Pt No Pt. at
1:35
Breach splash north of
Pt No Pt at
1:41pm
. I'm calling it for Admiralty Inlet.

1:26 -
More dorsals, quite close in, south of
Pt No Point
about 5 minutes ago. Just now, a group further south, spread out from mid channel to a bit east of mid channel.

1:24pm
. I'm at
Haines Wharf Park
(north of Edmonds, south of Meadowdale Park).

1:15 -
I see dorsal fins mostly heading north, favoring mid channel to west of mid channel (favoring
Pt No Point
) side. There could still be east side stragglers like at Richmond Beach earlier today, but greatest number of KWs seem to be more on an
Admiralty Inlet
path so far.

1:08 -
I saw dorsal fins moving north, closer to
Pt No Point / Kitsap side
about 10 minutes ago. Now seeing more sign of KWs N of Edmonds / S of Picnic Point, mid channel. Could go either way at this point.

11:40 am -
Update - sounds like the
orcas
have reached the Richmond Beach and
Edmonds
area, still heading north. Keep an eye on them and let us know if it looks like they're going to head north up into Possession Sound (Mukilteo/Clinton) or turn west out Admiralty Inlet (between Whidbey and N. Kitsap Peninsula) ~ hope the sun keeps shining!
*

11:24 -
Some straying farther east when group passed
Richmond Beach
a few min ago, great time to be at Edmonds about now.

11:19 -
Just saw a bunch pass midchannel heading north from north bluff of
Richmond Beach
park.
Jill Irwin

11:16 am -
Might be stalling or turning around south of
Pt No Point
- some fins going southbound.
Darcie Larson
*

11:30 -
At least
two more KWs
have appeared closer to
Richmond Beach
side now, and others appear to be spreading out from mid-channel, moving mostly north.

11:23 - Wow - at least
one large female
just breached in front of Richmond Beach. She's heading towards Pt. Wells / Edmonds now. Here's a link to 4 photos I took of the female that breached just off Richmond Beach. None are of the actual breach, just her swimming away afterward.

11:10 - Group is tightening up and reforming
. All on the west side of mud-channel buoy, still
south of Kingston
. At least 10 in the group now. Heading north.

11:02 -
Another group I'd missed is heading north; they are south of and approaching the mid-channel buoy, closer to the Kitsap side.

11:00 -
Lead group is roughly ESE of
Jefferson Beach Park's
dock. Still very active behavior (looks like foraging) with lots of sea birds nearby "helping out".

10:41 am -
Seeing them now: lots of blows along the
NE side of Bainbridge Island
. General trend still looks northbound.

9:25a.
.posting helps me find them : ) see many blows north of Eagle cove, probably approaching or near Rolling Bay (south of
Fay Bainbridge Park
). moving steadily north. Mid channel to west of.

8:50 am -
from
Richmond Beach
I could see some blows a bit north of her sighting, very mid channel, but have not had a visual since.
Alisa Lemire Brooks

Orcas
heading back north at

8:35
. Off
Bainbridge
approaching Eagle Harbor now. One may be past my point of viewing, but there are at least 10 including what looks like mom and baby. Good morning PNW!
