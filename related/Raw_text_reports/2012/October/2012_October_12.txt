Orca Sightings for October 12, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
No whales yesterday, but we did see lots of
Dall's porpoise
, and amazing country. Today, just as we were leaving the dock we heard over the radio, "Contact!" Ts at the top of
President Channel
. Great afternoon with the
T100s
and then we went up toward
Patos
to get a quick look at the
T30s
. Just about to head home and then they turned and headed toward the Patos Light. Couldn't leave! I love Orcas with lighthouses!
