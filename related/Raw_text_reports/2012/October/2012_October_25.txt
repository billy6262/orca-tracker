Orca Sightings for October 25, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Heard Orcas at approx.
2115
hrs both traveling and playing or feeding going south to north off
Mouat Point on Pender Island
(48 deg 46.6 x 123 deg 19.1). No idea about numbers or duration, as I had just stepped outside after walking the dog, but I could hear more than a few traveling both north and south of our location. I continued to listen until
2130
. I believe I heard an older and younger Orca playing or feeding at this location for that 15 minute period time before moving north.

I rushed out of the house to see them from Fay Bainbridge Park and caught them out towards
Discovery Park
. The orca endorphins cured my headache, so double thanks!

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries reports they were with
parts of L pod
today, leaving them around

5:30 pm
as the whales continued south past
West Pt.
Some of the whales were traveling very spread out throughout the day, other times bunching up into groups. Some foraging was observed, including a calf and a juvenile both with a salmon in their mouth, but no fish scales were collected today to determine fish species or stocks.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed reports of
Transient orcas - the T49s
- off the
Victoria Waterfront around

4:30 - 5 pm
today.

We found
a Transient Orca Super Pod of at least 28 whales
off the southern tip of
Texada Island
. We were the only boat with them and witnessed major amounts of socializing.... Basically a huge Transient party, everywhere you looked there were whales!!
Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay

We left our dock not knowing if there were any whales out there to be seen. Soon we heard of
humpbacks
up near
Moresby Island, BC
, to the west of
Stuart Island
. As we made our way to the humpies, we came across a group of
Dall's Porpoise
that played with the boat. After about 15 minutes we left the delightful black and white little guys and proceeded to the mom and calf humpback. Beautiful light, lots of fluking.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research relayed reports of a total of
9 humpback whales in the Victoria area
today in several locations, including
Constance Bank, Moresby Island, and Mouat Pt
