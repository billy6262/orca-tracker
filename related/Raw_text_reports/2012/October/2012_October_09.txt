Orca Sightings for October 9, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Made it just in time to see the
southern residents passing Keystone, Whidbey Island
today - spotted a big dorsal fin as we were launching the boat. It didn't take long to see more whales heading north towards a couple of whale watch boats, with Howie Garrett and Florian Graner nearby. Sea conditions were perfect, calm with no wind, and with the engine turned off we could hear those wonderful blows. Whales everywhere, ahead of us, either side of us, coming up behind us on yet another glorious October day. I've had my whale 'fix' before leaving for the UK to talk about the southern residents at Whale Fest.

Florian Graner and I launched under heavy overcast skies just before noon from the south end of Whidbey Island after hearing a report from Ken Balcomb that the
orcas were north of Point No Point, headed north
. We found the first dorsal fins just
south of Bush Point at
1:15
. They were spread out across Admiraly Inlet, with many close to the Whidbey side. I rapidly fired off ID shots as Florian alternately shot stills and HD footage, some mixed with incredible vocals through a hydrophone. We hop-scotched along as small groups and singles appeared at random all around us, ever northward
past Lagoon Point
. As we approached the Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry lane the clouds lifted and blue skies spread across the horizon. From
Admiral's Cove to Port Townsend Bay
dorsals continually rose with the mighty whooosh of orca breath, only to glide back beneath the glassy surface. For miles in all directions breaches were seen and heard, with occasional spy-hops and taillobs animating the flat water, as ferries sailed past. We had the feeling of accompanying a meandering tribe of foraging orcas making their way to parts unknown (to us). It was hard to know how many were ahead or behind us at any time, but by the angled sun at about

5:15 pm we were roughly 2 miles SW of Smith Island
, or 6-8 miles south of Lopez Is., and it was time to head back.

Some of the
SRKW's today in Admiralty Inlet
. What a treat to spend several hours with them as they slowly meandered northward,
between Bush Point and Ebey's Landing
, spread out across the entire Inlet. Granny, Blackberry, Speiden and Polaris were the easy ones to recognize but there were many many whales out there.

I thought I would report sighting what appeared to be
two pods of Orcas
, at least they were quite a distance apart from one another. I was fishing at
Lagoon Point
when we sighted them. Not yet being aware of the kind of information you like to observe, I can only say that the first pod seemed to have five Orcas and one of them definitely had a very large fin (male). They were traveling south to north and if I recall correctly it was shortly after high tide (

1:41pm
) and not long after a submarine had just gone by heading out to sea. They were not playing or delaying, but traveling north at a pretty good clip. We spotted them south of the beach and lost track of them after the
Port Townsend area
. They were too far out to see any markings, pretty much in the shipping lanes. Hope that info is helpful.

Observed what appeared to be
8 to 10 orcas moving north very slowly between Bush Point and Lagoon Point at between
12:50 and
1:15pm
. Lots of tail slapping, spy hopping and a couple of good breaches. Fun to watch!

12:10 -
Karen Anderson called from
south of Bush Point, Whidbey Island
, while watching many orcas very close to shore, breaching, spyhopping and very active.
