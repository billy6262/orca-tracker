Orca Sightings for December 3, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
The endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales visited
Vashon and Maury Islands
, searching for salmon. As they passed Point Robinson, they burst into playful antics that have to be seen to be believed: cartwheels, breaches, tail slaps, spyhops, and beautiful synchronized swimming in their tightly knit family groups.

They're moving north fast - seeing about 4-5 so far.

3:12 -
Moving past the lighthouse now but they're on the
Bainbridge
side and visibility might make them difficult to see.

2:24 -
Seem to me making a pretty good pace. Front of group is just passing
Eagle Harbor
. I am counting at least 8, but I'm sure there are more. My guess is 15 minutes maybe until they come into view at
Fay Bainbridge park
.

Noon -
I saw a
huge pod
that hung out in front of
Lincoln park
after noon today! Nervous seal lion bull swimming back and forth 15 feet from shore. So COOL!!! There were definitely more than 10 and the guy next to me thought 20. The one that brought up the rear, kind of hanging to the east of a tug boat and its ship it towed had a very tall dorsal fin and BIG. They took their time going by, about a 30 minute chance to view them I'd say.

Keep your eyes out - the whales are not traveling as a group. They are clearly feeding and slowly moving north. Just left Alki 5 minutes ago, and there were still stragglers going past Bainbridge.
