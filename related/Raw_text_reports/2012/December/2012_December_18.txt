Orca Sightings for December 18, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:38 -
Jeff Lamarche of Eagle Wing Tours called at to say he's with
all three pods spread out 6.5 miles NW of Pt. Wilson
(north end of Admiralty Inlet) and heading west toward Victoria.
*
Starting from
Bush Pt.
, Whidbey Island about

10:10 this morning orcas were spread out to the south, coming north
. They slowly passed us, so about

11:25
we went to
Lagoon Point
and found them again, still heading north, now accompanied by Ken Balcomb, who came down from San Juan Island to meet them. Ken had ID'd several
K and J pod members
, and L87, and was escorting them north out of Admiralty Inlet as we left them at

12:25
. Ken called at 1 pm to report seeing
all three pods
, lots of L pod orcas along with Js and Ks. He'll have to go over the photos to have a complete list.

.

9:06 AM -
Christine on Victoria Clipper reports
J and K pods north of Point No Point
, between Foulweather Bluff and Useless Bay, spread out, foraging, slowly moving north. The sun's out, the wind is down, but large dark clouds are looming.
*

9:00 AM -
I'm watching
Orcas
right now just outside of
Useless Bay
. It appears they are going north. The are in front of the Victoria Clipper which is barely moving and that is what first caught our attention.
