I did my first watch for
Orcas
today and saw two whales at approximately Lat 47.917323. Long 122.320573 in
Possession Sound along the Mukilteo shoreline
. The time of this sighting was

2:45 p.m.
They were in Possession Sound swimming along the Mukilteo shoreline - not that far out. What I saw was this. First I just saw a fin and back going in and out of the water. Then another fin and back and then the two jumped almost straight up out of the water together. Then they were both swimming along and my view was blocked by a tree. I could see no markings at all. Just some white when they jumped out of the water. I am making an assumption that they were Orcas but really would not have recognized them specifically as Orcas since I was so far away and didn't see any markings. I was on a bluff about 1000 feet away from the water maybe 300 feet elevation and about two miles south of the Mukilteo Clinton Ferry on 92nd Street just past Sunset Lane. The spot was a good one, but I need to get closer to the water. I could see into Saratoga Passage and Port Susan on the other side of Gedney Island and then behind to Puget Sound.
