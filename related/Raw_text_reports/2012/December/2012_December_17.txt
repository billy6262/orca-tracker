Orca Sightings for December 17, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:47 pm - SRKW calls
began on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
. They were distant with noise from the rough seas. The calls lasted seven minutes.

The Captain on the

2:20 PM ferry out of Fauntleroy
announced Orcas off the port side..they were traveling quite fast between Vashon Island and Southworth heading up Colvos passage. One had a very big dorsal, appeared to be at least 8 of them. Sure made for a fun commute!!

11 am -
Amongst all the floating logs there are
a group of orcas in between Bainbridge and Seattle
right now. Mid channel off Rockaway, just approaching the ferry lanes. Looks like a good number, guessing maybe 10 at least. Heading south. 2 males, 4 females and what looks like maybe baby J49. It's pretty choppy and wind swept out there. Log, log, fin... Should be visible from west Seattle now, but closer to BI at this moment. Who knows how many more are hiding in the white caps!

At about

2:15 this morning
I think I heard orca's on the
Port Townsend Hydrophone
. The
calls
were strong and loud, considering I had the volume turned down.
