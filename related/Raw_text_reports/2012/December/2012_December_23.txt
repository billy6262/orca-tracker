1:30 -
I was sitting at
Point Holmes
(
north end of Georgia Strait
, opposite Powell River BC) looking out at the ocean and all of a sudden
a pod of orcas
passed by (coming from the direction of Comox Harbour). Not sure how many. One adult (quite a long upright dorsal fin), maybe 2 adolescent and 3 babies. They were in fairly close to shore and the young ones were playing around a bit. Then they headed out deeper and couldn't really see where they went - possibly toward Powell River or down channel by Hornby Island. What a treat - would they have been residents?
