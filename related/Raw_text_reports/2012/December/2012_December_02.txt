3 pm -
What a day with whales traveling
south down Admiralty Inlet
and an array of devoted 'orcaholics' on the shore. Lots of big splashy breaches and cart-wheels among the white-caps, and shimmering vapor blowing on the wind from the whales' exhalations. Such an energizing sight on this wild day on Whidbey.

Ed & I boarded a ferry, wound our way to Point No Point to spend a day wandering the shores along the orca path. On the beach & in the company of many excited people (many names we recognize from Orca Network FB page) we shared the excitement of seeing these beautiful whales.
The pods were spread across the inlet, north/south, east/west
. The wind whipping fierce, waves rolling sometimes 5-6 feet in height just out where the tide rip rumbles off the point. The
orca passed in groups of 2-5
heading southbound stalling to lunge, breach, spyhop..humbling & thrilling their human bystanders quite wildly. The baby
J49
surfaced very close to shore in & amongst these bonded families of orca. They & we continued this journey
southward, past Eglon
. At last sight we saw one female
nearing Kingston
(could it be J2 Granny?). Another exhilarating day spent exploring this magnificent place we all share & call home.
