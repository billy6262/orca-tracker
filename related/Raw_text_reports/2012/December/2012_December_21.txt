Orca Sightings for December 21, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I are members of your network and live on the water on the Saratoga Passage. We are located on the
northern tip of Camano Island
. We had
a large pod (we counted at least 13)
of whales directly off
Rocky Point, Camano Island
for several hours this afternoon. They spent the afternoon hunting and fishing. Wonderful to watch! We have included a bit of our footage for you to enjoy.

I'm a commercial crabber and I was out by
Smith Island
on Friday 12/21 and saw
a pod of four Orcas
. They were about a 1/2 mile northeast of Smith island. They were traveling west-southwest and all periodically breaching clear out of the water. Didn't notice any particular markings. There were definitely 4 of them though.

Note: these could have been transient orcas
.)

I came across the
L12's and 22's
west bound late afternoon on
December 21st near Race Rocks. They were traveling between 8 and 10 knots with a big ebb current.

They're definitely heading south! I lost them for a while, but now in the waning light, saw a breach and tail lob .... all the way down near Cama Beach. Don't know if these are the leaders or stragglers ...

3:30 pm -
We watched the whales from Kineth Point for well over an hour, and they stayed pretty much in the same area,
between Utsalady on Camano and Strawberry Point on Whidbey
. Now I'm back at my house and can still see blows off Utsalady, which is to the north east. IF i see them heading back south, will let you know. What a treat for for Solstice!!!

1:53 pm - Orcas
observed off
Madrona Beach on Camano Island
feeding and traveling North. At least 1 male sighted possibly 2. Some in close to shore, most out in middle of passage, too far to identify. So exciting!!!

They're still heading very slowly north, I'm heading to Penn Cove to see if they make that left hand turn into the Cove.

12:03 -
They're just
north of Cama Beach
right not, slightly closer to Camano side. 4 positive sightings, just north of Cama beach.

Looks like enough to be residents,
about 15-2
0, and I think I saw an open saddle on the left side. They should be coming up to Penn Cove by now.

11:50
, watched a pod of orcas swim up
Saratoga Passage
, passing our home and Orca Network office just north of Greenbank on Whidbey Island - what a nice way to begin the Solstice! Several adult males, mid-channel, all of them seeming to be in travel mode and moving rather quickly toward the Oak Harbor/Penn Cove area.

Michael Patching called at

to say he had just seen
two orcas heading north up Saratoga Passage
past Baby Island (at the head of Holmes Harbor), toward Greenbank! He said one was a very large male.
