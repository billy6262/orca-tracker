Noon - We received an early Christmas present when a
pod of orca
passed by our home at point
Richmond Beach
near gig harbor on Colvos passage. I'm guessing that this must have been
J or K pod
due to the number (20ish). They were traveling north tightly grouped, angling away, at about 1/4 mile off shore and surfacing 3-4 times before they apparently dove.
