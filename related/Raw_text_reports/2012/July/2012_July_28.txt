Orca Sightings for July 28, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
This time of year we can find female humpback whales and sometimes their calves, usually south of Victoria. Saturday night the Resident Orcas left for the salmon infested waters out near the entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Hopefully they'll be back soon. They were gone two days the last time. We got to see the
Humpies
yesterday, but not today. Too far. West of Pt. Angeles is too far. We only see females and calves because the Humpback males and females only get together during the mating season, unlike Orcas and humans.

Between Lopez and San Juan Island
we spotted
three killer whale dorsal fins
. It was the
K-13's
. Not too far from them was a large male, who we recognized as
L-87 or Onyx
. The whales started traveling along the west coast of the island. We got spectacular views of them, especially when one spy hopped! They were spreading out along the coast, giving us the opportunity to see whales all over.
