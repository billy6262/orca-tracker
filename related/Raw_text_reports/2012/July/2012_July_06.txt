Orca Sightings for July 6, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
This
afternoon J-Pod
and their
five L-Pod friends (L87, L53, L72, L95, L105)
were doing the westside shuffle up and down
San Juan Island
. When I got to Land Bank's Westside Preserve, all the whales were heading north around

3:30 PM
in one fairly tight group. Not all of them continued north, however, and some whales never made it as far as Lime Kiln. From
4 PM - 7 PM
whales slowly made their way back south. Most whales were going on long dives and zig-zagging every which way, presumably foraging. Others were in a social mood, with some rolling around at the surface. They were spread out over several miles by this time. Just before 7, a few whales headed south with a purpose, porpoising against the strong flood tide.

We spotted
killer whales just off False Bay
(48ยบ 27.462' N 123ยบ 03.376' W). We first saw a huge male who looked to be alone, but after a few more minutes we realized that there were whales scattered everywhere. The male was later identified as
J-27 or "Blackberry"
and another male around was identified as
J-34 or "Doublestuf."
Then we saw a group of four females swimming close together. They surfaced almost in unison, allowing us to hear their powerful exhalations before diving back under. Finally, before having to head back we watched as the whales moved close to each other closer to the shore. They started to become playful: cartwheeling, lob tailing, and swimming upside down, allowing us to see their beautiful white undersides.
