Orca Sightings for July 22, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I took a whaling tour aboard Orcas Eclipse Charters based on Orcas Island. It was a great day for viewing and enjoying the beauty of the Orcas that were in the vicinity. Of special note was
Love Play between K20 Spock and J26 Mike at
14:45 off Eagle Point
, San Juan Island. This was identified by the onboard naturalist, Deborah Martyn, Orcas Eclipse Charters. This was an awesome experience!

John Rogstad of Washington State Ferries called to relay a report from the Chelan that
orcas are frolicking in Rosario Strait
.

Headed south out of Cattle Pass, we saw a large collection of birds including rhinoceros auklets and Heermann's gulls feeding at the surface of the water. Then we saw the spray.
Two minke whales
were feeding nearby (48째25.432N, 122째57.013W). Minke whales commonly consume small fish and krill. After observing these mammals for a few minutes, we turned west in search of the largest member of the Delphinidae (dolphin) family, the ORCA! Three miles off
Eagle Point
of San Juan Island (48째24.816N, 123째52.887W), we saw
several orcas actively feeding and diving. J26 "Mike" and J28 "Polaris"
were out and about.
L85 "Mystery"
was also hunting for salmon. The residents were showing flukes-- cartwheeling and tail slapping. Some spy-hopping was observed. Splashing and rolling too.
