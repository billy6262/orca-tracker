We departed Friday Harbor heading north, and did not have to travel far. We caught up with
three killer whales
just on the north side of
Henry Island
(48째 36.720'N 123째 12.300'W). We watched for a while before seeing blows off in the distance. Three,
four more killer whales
were in the area. They changed direction, so did we. Then, all of a sudden we saw
at least twenty dorsal fins
slice through the surface of the water, all less than a body length from each other! We also noticed there was a large group near shore. The sky was full of their misty exhalations. I got to see my second
greeting ceremony
in two days when the two large groups came towards each other. They seemed to synchronize their surfacing as they lined up. But, as they met I saw something different from yesterday: the whales circled each other once before moving off in the same direction they came from! It was spectacular! All in all there were
at least thirty whales, from all three Southern Resident pods
. Again, they were being very active, lob tailing, breaching, and spy hopping. It was difficult to identify individuals since fins and saddle patches were everywhere, but we were able to distinguish
J-27 Blackberry, J-14 Samish, L-87 Onyx, L-86 Surprise, and K-21 Cappuccino
out of the wave of dorsal fins in the groups.

On last night's sunset cruise we caught up with two groups of about
20+ Southern Resident Killer Whales
headed south in
Rosario Strait between Cypress and Blakely Island
(48째34.46N, 123째46.05W). They hadn't gone far since the greeting ceremony earlier that day, but you could tell the excitement had worn on them. They appeared to be resting, moving at a steady pace in unison, only coming up for 3-5 breaths before taking long dives. From what we had identified, it was members of
L-pod including Onyx (L87), Gaia (L78), and Crewser (L92)
. We watched them rest for a while, but they must have sensed our curiosity because eventually they spruced up, spyhopping, swimming on their sides, waving their pectoral fins, and lobtailling. The setting couldn't have been more perfect to embrace these animals. With Mt. Baker glowing in the background, the sun setting, and only 2 other boats around, it really felt like it was just us and them.
