Continuing around to the west side (of
San Juan Island
), we ran into some fog and slowed. We could make out some boats, so we stopped and started to look for whales. Through the fog we heard the distinctive "powoof" of
a killer whale
surfacing to breath. We then saw a single female pass by. The fog began to lift, and we traveled further north. Just south of Lime Kiln we encountered five more killer whales, one of which was J-34, "Doublestuf."
