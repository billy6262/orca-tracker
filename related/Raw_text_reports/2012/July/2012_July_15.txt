Orca Sightings for July 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
3-5 killer whales
between the Amphitrite lighthouse (
Ucluelet
, BC NW of Strait of Juan de Fuca) and the red whistle buoy at
7pm
heading East. I took some pictures where you can clearly identify them as Orcas but not good enough to be sure if that were Transients or Residents. I suppose they were Transients. We were shore based so distance was quite high and the sea was a bit rough.
