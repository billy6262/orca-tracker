Orca Sightings for July 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tonight at

6:38 PM
a group of kayakers who had paddled to
Burrow's lighthouse (south of Anacortes
on the east side of Rosario Strait) saw
two whales
headed south from the lighthouse bluff. It's on Burrow's Island, west side tip, so this is south of Washington Park, Anacortes, near where the ferry leaves from, and across from Shoal Bight (that would be across the channel and south). Hole in the Wall is a kayak club - we were having a dinner paddle from Washington Park to the Burrow's island and back (not very far, just a couple of hours). I don't think we could have seen then unless we'd been up on the lighthouse bluff. These were my first whales this year, so I was pretty excited - you could just see them on the edge of the fog bank, very lovely. Lots of harbor seals in the kelp below the lighthouse. There was one smaller one, then a larger one. From the fin size and shape, and the length and behavior of the whales - we are
pretty sure they were two Minke's
, one smaller in front, and a larger one just behind.

Whales were spread out between Stuart Island and Lime Kiln State Park
. A mama and calf were first spotted off
Henry Island, near Kellett Bluff
(48°34.60N, 123°12.03W). Moving extremely fast, almost to be confused with porpoise, they were headed south to catch up with the rest of the pack. Also rode with another female and
Onyx (L87)
.
