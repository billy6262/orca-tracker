Orca Sightings for July 16, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two friends and I saw what we think was
one adult and one calf Orca
off the mouth of Rendsland Creek (
south end of Hood Canal
), near high tide. Our location is 123deg7'W Long and 47deg23'N Lat. I saw only the splashes, but my friends said they saw one large fin and a small fin, and the splashes also looked like two individuals. My impression was that they were moving northward toward the mouth of the Canal, but I'm not positive. Sorry I can't give you more details; they were quite a ways offshore.
