Orca Sightings for July 8, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was in Howe Sound (north of Vancouver) yesterday around

8:00 pm
I saw
two orcas
traveling very fast in between
Gambier and Bowen islands
(north of Vancouver). I saw them from the bc ferry going from Langdale to Horseshoe Bay. They were traveling west. Also spoke to another couple of people they said they also saw some orcas off Roberts Creek earlier in the day.

I observed
two humpback whales in Port Angeles Harbor,

8:40-
9:30 p.m.
They appeared to be feeding, concentrating in the areas immediately east of the tip of Ediz Hook. Probably a mother/calf pair as one was considerably smaller than the other.

8:30 pm - S. of Hood Pt., Bowen Island, in the Strait of Georgia.(north of Vancouver)
heading to shore. Possibly
2 juveniles 1 adult
. Transients? hunting at the shores. It was high tide so the seals couldn't haul out because of steep shores. The whales appeared after a couple jet skis finally left and it was a quiet Sunday night around
8:30 pm. The rested at the surface a couple times. Saw a fair bit of spouting, no big splashy events. no tails, just dorsal fins.
