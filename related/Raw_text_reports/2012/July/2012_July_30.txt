Orca Sightings for July 30, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Got to go stand-up paddling amongst
grays at Hobuck Beach (Makah Bay)
in the morning. Paddled out all alone, sat down and put on a bull kelp seat belt/anchor, and settled in for the show. Spent almost an hour with a healthy adult gray, lounging and playing just off the kelp bed. A harbor porpoise escort saw me out and back in (feeding in the tideline). Made my week! There were between
3-6 grays just outside of the bay for each of the 4 days we were there
. At least one little one.
