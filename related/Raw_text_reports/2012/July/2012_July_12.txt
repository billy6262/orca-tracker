Orca Sightings for July 12, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Time:
1400
hours, Location: 48 59.963 , -123 36.815 .. West side of Reid Island, near Porlier Pass (
south of Nanaimo
). Small pod of about
5 Orcas fishing off Reid Island
. I was too far away for pictures or identification, but at least one young Orca and one large male. Because they were milling about it was hard to tell exactly how many there were. When a couple of boats came down Trincomali Channel they left, unknown direction of travel.
Note: It's not clear whether these were residents or transients.

We caught up with
killer whales
just as they were swimming across
Turn Point
, off Stuart Island, heading west. The whales were not just slowly traveling by; they were porpoising out of the water, moving fast! All together there were four of them. Two were right next to each other, their bodies flying out of the water in full synchronization. Four more killer whales followed shortly after. There were two large males in this small group. We could see their massive dorsal fins at least four hundred yards in the distance before they too made it to Turn Point and went on by. Finally, we came across two other female orcas. Their bodies also were coming out of the water, providing the perfect opportunity for a young guest to snap a fantastic photo!
