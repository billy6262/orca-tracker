Orca Sightings for July 24, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
My brother and I believe that we witnessed the birth of
a new baby orca calf
. We were traveling North from Nanaimo and had entered the South end of the
Malaspina Strait near Pender Harbour
when we spotted some whales ahead of us. We immediately stopped the boat and took a number of pictures as the whales passed by us at about a 300 yard distance. It was
10:24AM on
July 24th, 2012. We did not know at the time what we had witnessed. We only figured it out after inspecting the pictures - later that day - to see what we had gotten. To our surprise we had witnessed the actual birthing process of a baby Orca. We could see a whale roll to her right side, with another whale right on her underside. We saw one of the whales (possibly the Grandmother) help the baby up into the air. We then saw the other Orca's pushing or eating the afterbirth. What a surprise it was.
