Orca Sightings for July 1, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
2:30pm, my neighbors and I saw what appeared to be the same 2 whales only this time in
Eld Inlet
. The whales were across from Sunset Beach (often called Evergreen State College - Goeduck beach) only on the Steamboat Island side where we live just south of Flap Jack Point. I was on the shore so I didn't see the whales up closely. However, it appeared they were traveling very close together this time showing only their dorsal fins and a small amount of their back. It seemed to me the whales were more lethargic Almost like one of them was trying to help out the other. They traveled south, then north, and then south. I'd say they showed themselves maybe 10 times. Then I didn't see them come up again. I'll keep you posted if I see them again. Feel free to email me if you have questions.

3:00pm
I was boating just north of
Boston Harbor near Olympia
. I saw 2 whales. I believe they were Minke Whales. They were traveling together. I slowed the boat engine down to neutral to get a better view. They showed only their backs and dorsal fin. I didn't see their head or tail above the water line. Their backs appeared to be about 4 feet wide. They surfaced maybe 5-7 times and then didn't come up again. They traveled north and then south. They seemed to be having fun. I'm not sure if they were feeding or just swimming about.

Entry 2:
While underway on our sailboat (under power), we encountered a pod of
4 and maybe 5 orcas in Admiralty Inlet
. We were just south of
Bush Pt
and they were headed in a northerly direction that favored closing in on the shoreline. It was approximately
1230 pm
. Our initial sighting was one (I would guess male) who seemed to be interested in approaching us. He went out of his way and closed to within 200 yards before heading back to join the others.

This afternoon
all of J-Pod and the few L-Pod whales
headed north past
Land Bank's Westside Preserve
on the west side of San Juan Island between
12 and 1 PM.
A few hours later, the group split, and about half the whales came back south, passing
Land Bank between
3:30 and
4:30 PM
.

We continued northwest towards
Stuart Island
and encountered
Onyx, L-87
, slowly traveling the same direction, just south of
Turn Point
(48째39.931N, 123째14.114W). As we continued into Boundary Pass, we encountered
members of J-pod, including Granny, J-2
. Four females were traveling close together as they hugged the south side of South Pender Island (48째42.999N, 123째14.294). After observing these fascinating mammals, we returned south and cut between Stuart Island and Johns Island.

At about
8am
there was a very dispersed group of at least
8 orcas
traveling slowly east to west past I
ceberg Point on South Lopez
. The whales were sufficiently spread out that it took about an hour for all of them to pass.

We had an amazing day on the water today in our neck of the woods. Our Transidential Gangs all showed up today.
T002C's/T086A's/T090's/T100's/T101's and 102 Gangs
! The coolest part of the day though was this guy!!! I did a triple take as i was running and had to come to a stop fast! We found a Sea Otter just off of the
south end of Quadra Island, in Sutil Channell
head south slowly about 1/4 mile from one gang of Transients! As far as I know and I am waiting for confirmation on this its the first sighting on the inside coast in our area if not ever then in a very long time. One of the other operators out that saw it has been on the water as a fisherman on the inside coast for 50 + years and has never seen one!! Well to say the least I am very excited with this find! Picture has been sent to Jared towers (DFO) and he has forwarded it to the DFO Otter specialist. I am awaiting an answer back with some more info.
