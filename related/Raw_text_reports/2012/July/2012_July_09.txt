I took my 5 yr old Scottish grandson Francis out whale watching today - on Mystic Sea - and we had some wonderful viewing,
J22
surfaced right next to the boat, along with J26. Almost too close for photos - what a treat. It was a fairly rough day on the water, but the wind subsided somewhat and we saw roughly a dozen whales, very spread out, south of
False Bay
. Mostly the whales were too distant to ID, but we heard Granny was in the area but we didn't get a good look at her. But Oreo (J22) was very cooperative as she swam right by our port side. A lot of excitement for the passengers AND Francis (and me)!
