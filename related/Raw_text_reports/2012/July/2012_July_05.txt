Members of the
Southern Resident Killer Whale population
were observed along the west side of
San Juan Island
near Lime Kiln State Park (48°31.53N, 123°10.47W). We first saw
L87, "Onyx"
, an adult male that frequently spends time with members of
J-Pod
. Closer to shore we identified
J26, "Mike"
, another large, mature male. We suspected J26 to be foraging as he was changing direction quickly and frequently; his nearly 6 foot tall dorsal fin slicing through the water at all angles as he maneuvered. Another group of at least 10 whales from J-Pod were traveling in close proximity to each other, near shore. This group included adult females, one sub-adult male, and one calf; among them was J27, "Blackberry", a 21 year old male. The whales were slowly traveling north before they decided to perform a number of surface behaviors: one whale spy-hopped, not once but twice then the calf entertained us with a wee breach, while a few other whales lobtailed.
