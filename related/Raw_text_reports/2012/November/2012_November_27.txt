Orca Sightings for November 27, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
What a remarkable day with the whales. Picked them up around noon as they were coming through the ferry lanes towards
Dilworth on Vashon Island
. They were traveling in several groups - spread out like a fantastic whale parade, and kept up their fast southbound pace until they hit
Point Robinson
. From there the lead group made a close pass and went around the bend... then gave us a bonus round as they turned back to wait for the rest. We actually had several groups logging or very slowly milling a hundred or so feet out from the beach. Never seen em stay directly on the Point for so long. About an hour later the rest of the crew lined up for an even closer pass - made even more fabulous by the Mount Rainier backdrop and a just starting to set sun. Wow.
