Orca Sightings for November 9, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:30pm, near Kelp Reef marker in Haro Strait, T-93 and T-97
transient orca. T-97 was toying with a harbor seal before we arrived on scene and continued to do so for multiple hours. At one point the harbor seal lunged at the whale! T-93 was off in the distance during most of our encounter.

Today, down working on the boat, temptation raised her lovely head over the VHF radio..."Peregrine...Fast Tide...I just found
two Orcas near Kelp Reef
!" Kelp Reef is about three miles from my dock at Snug Resort. Called Jeanne and she said she is on her way. 15 minutes later we are under way, and in 10 minutes we spot Fast Tide, out of Victoria, with the Ts.
T97 and T93
, whom we have never seen before. T97 has a big harbor seal, and is doing the "cat and mouse" thing with the seal. For 90 minutes we watch the big male Orca "play' with the seal. Much of the time we had to back away from them as the seal kept swimming toward us to use the boat as protection. I've seen seals climb onto the swim steps of boats to escape Orcas. Not a good thing. When we left them, the seal was still alive. It's a tough world out there, but an exciting one. T97 is huge and so beautiful. An amazing day with two Transient male Orcas in Haro Strait.
