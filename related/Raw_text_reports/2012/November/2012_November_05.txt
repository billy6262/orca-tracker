Orca Sightings for November 5, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lots of Dall's Porpoise
, the fastest small cetacean in our waters. Today the light was perfect and the Dall's were mugging our boat. We also saw lots of Steller Sea Lions, loons, eagles, seals, and amazing scenery.
