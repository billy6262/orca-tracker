Ivan found the
humpback whale in San Juan Channel
out in the middle between
Turn Island and Lopez around
1:00ish
. We followed it up San Juan Channel toward Friday Harbor. It then made a little jaunt up to Yellow Island to visit Phil before it turned and appeared to be heading for Deer Harbor. That's where we left it because it was starting to get dark... :)
