Orca Sightings for November 10, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
T20 and T21
were seen off
Discovery Island
and were heard on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
in the afternoon according to Ken Balcomb.
*
We arrived on scene at about

2:00p.m. in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, west of Victoria
, to meet
J and K pods
, and
Onyx L-87
as they headed east, appearing to be heading for San Juan Island.
Granny J-2, Onyx L-87, Spieden J-8, baby J-49, Cappuccino K-21, Saturna K-43, Ripple K-44, Blackberry J-27
and many more were spread out, taking their time. In the midst of the encounter,
two humpback whales
who had been east of Discovery Island earlier in the day, came west 'through' the residents who were going east. And at about

5:00 p.m.
(reported to me by a reliable source on shore)
T-20 and T-21 passed by Lime Kiln Lighthouse
very close to shore, heading north.
J and K signature calls began very faintly over the Lime Kiln hydrophones at
6:38 p.m.
Over the next several hours they were heard between the Orca Sound and Lime Kiln hydrophones intermittently.
