Orca Sightings for November 13, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted
a large group of T's from shore at
9:30 east bound approaching Trial Island
. They dispersed into several small groups after exiting Oak Bay. Dave Ellifrit and Ken Balcomb of the Centre for Whale Research found the
T123's and T18's
near
Beaumont Shoals at
11:30
and I came across the
T30's 2 miles to the west
. The
T049A's and T036A's
were later picked north bound
near Kelp Reef
also north bound.
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales
