Approximately

11:40 am
an announcement was made from the BC Ferry (going from
Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay
there were
killer whales
ahead. This was just before we entered
Active Pass
, and they were heading out into the Strait, so our time with them was very brief. At least 3 perhaps 5.

2 Humpback whales off Sooke
. While out on a training mission for the new Sooke Marine Rescue and Habitat Watch, we were looking at a large vertical Dead Head and the 2 Whales came straight at us 2 check us out and then dove off.
