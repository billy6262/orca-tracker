From

11:00am to
12:30pm
today I observed over 10 orcas feeding, and frolicking north and northeast of
Point No Point
. The Orcas were closer to the Whidbey Island side than the Point No Point side. It started to rain and visibility became poor at
12:30, but on the whole they were slowly moving westward when I left the beach at point no point.

Just spotted them just north of
Apple Tree Point
, not moving very fast but heading back
towards pt no pt
. A nice treat on this wet, blustery day!

Just saw at least two and maybe
4 Orcas close into Point No Point
, close in and heading south past the lighthouse. At least 1 male from the size of the dorsal fin.
