Orca Sightings for March 26, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients at Lime Kiln
22:57
. Occasional
transient calls
over last five minutes. Didn't hear on Orcasound previously. Also, the newly arrived Beam Reach students saw a Steller sea lion at Lime Kiln at
17:00 and I saw one at Orcasound at 1935. Both were heading south.

I was out for a daysail in
Commencement Bay, Tacoma
when this
pod of orcas
came cruising in at

6:30
. I was the only boat in the bay on a beautiful March day. This sighting made the day even more special. After a short while the group headed out of the bay going south. I have also posted more text along with the attached photos on our blog.

Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries called Monday morning at

8:08 am
to report a pod of
3+ orcas
half way between
Pt. Wells and Kingston
, heading south into Puget Sound (likely the pod that was sighted in Commencement Bay later in the day, and most likely one of the Transient pods that had been off San Juan Island last weekend).
