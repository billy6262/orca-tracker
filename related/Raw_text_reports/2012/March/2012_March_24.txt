Orca Sightings for March 24, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Lamarche, onboard the BC Whale Tour boat, called at

4:40 pm
to report they were with the same group of
Transients
that was around yesterday - the four
T2Cs (T2C, T2C1, T2C2 & T2C3), at Smallpox Bay
, west San Juan Island, heading slowly south.
*
John Boyd called at

2:10pm
with the
T2Cs
near
Battleship Rock
(where Speiden Channell joins Haro Strait). The whales were generally milling with no direction of travel.
*
While hiking Ebey's Landing on the
west side of Whidbey Island, a single gray whale
was following the shoreline north around
3 pm
. Quite a few hikers were thrilled to see it. We noticed a couple of spy hops, but it mostly just seemed to be meandering north.

Around

4:30 a grey whale
was seen at the mouth of
Holmes Harbor
, out from Greenbank beach. I watched it for about 20 min before losing sight of it.

4-6pm - Two grays
feeding in shallow water just north of
Langley
, easily visible from the Langley waterfront.
Rob Plaza, Camano Isl
*
At 4PM
saw spouts off Forbes Pt/Seaplane Base area outside
Oak Harbor
. In 100 to 130 feet of water,
a single gray
continually stayed in this same area. Surfacing to spout a few times, then would roll, show its fluke/dive and each time stay submerged for 5 to 8 minutes. Sure seemed obvious feeding on something, but what? Left gray at

5:30PM
with sun shining above Olympics. As, I headed back to Mariner's Cove, looking back from [Polnell Point] could easily see the spouts shoot up into the air from a distance of a couple of miles away.

Ranger Hawkins at the
Pt. Reyes CA Lighthouse
called Orca Network to report that at about
3 pm, 8-9 orcas apparently killed a gray whale calf
within 10-15 feet of the rocks below the lighthouse, while about 35 people looked on. The episode that was witnessed lasted only about 3 minutes, after which the mother of the calf continued northward. Unfortunately no photos are available to identify the orcas or the gray whale involved.
*
Call from Garry Henkel of
7 to 10 Orca by Campbell River
. There were 2 big males. He had heard they were Northbound by Cape Mudge around
10am and at
12:40 pm
they were around the Browns Bay area looking like they were chasing seals. His call came in as he was watching the Orca breaching and spy hopping as we spoke between

6:50 and 7 pm
. They did not have a direction in mind, but seemed to be milling about.

There were
4 or 5 orcas
in front of
Campbell River
between
5 and 6 pm
, quite playful and slowly heading south. They seemed to be deliberately staying close to a couple of pleasure boats that were drifting near them.
