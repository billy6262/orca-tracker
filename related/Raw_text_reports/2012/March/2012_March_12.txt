Orca Sightings for March 12, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Aloha spotted
5 transient orcas near Anacapa Island
today at about

12:50pm
. Island Packer's vessel Island Adventurer got them shortly after 2pm, about 3 miles off of the west end of Anacapa Island (
between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles CA
, about 15 miles offshore). These whales included the male
CA217
("Chopfin"), who has a very damaged dorsal fin (entanglement injury, then propeller wound). This matriline is the
CA216s
- the same matriline that Ken Balcomb, Mark Malleson and others saw on the ACS Conference Whalewatch trip on
November 12 2010 off of Monterey, CA. The orcas were feeding on some unidentified prey. Luke says that they were very playful: "lots of tail slapping, and one was doing head stands every couple of minutes!"
