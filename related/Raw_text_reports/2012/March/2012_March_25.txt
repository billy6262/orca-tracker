Just chatted with Jeanne.
J Pod
, both As and Bs, with Granny, on the West Side right now about a mile off shore in the
Kelp Reef
-ish area. They came in late this afternoon, after our trip today. Some of my group got to see them from Lime Kiln after the trip with Jeannie Hyde, our naturalist. She took them to the light house to check out rumors, and after a while the reported "Transients" showed up. All of J Pod. I love those guys!

At

3:30 p.m.
I spotted Granny
J-2
traveling north a half mile south of
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. Behind her, spread out for a great distance was the rest of
J pod
. The whales I saw were:
J-2, J-8, J-19, J-41, L-87, the J22s, the J34s, the J17s, members of the J11s, members of the J14s and members of the J16s - Mike J-26
being one of them. I last saw them north of Andrews Bay, more than a mile from shore, continuing north at
6:05 pm. Their
calls
could be heard on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
until after
7 pm
. Pictures and more of the encounter posted on my blog: Whale of A Purpose.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island

After a call this afternoon from Jeanne, I made it out to the westside to see
J pod
very spread out in singles and small groups about midstrait heading north up
Haro Strait
. The whales made it north of CWR around
1810
still mid strait.

Jeff Lamarche called with a report at

4:08 pm - the 8 - 10 Transients
they had been with were 4.7 miles SE of Seabird Rock/Discovery Island, heading SE toward Whidbey Island. At the same time, he had a call from Jeanne Hyde reporting
J pod
heading north up the west side of San Juan Island. She had ID'd
J2, J8
& others off
Lime Kiln Park
.

3:15 pm -
Jeff Lamarche called with
6-10 transient orcas
heading east about 3 miles south of
Discovery Island
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

Two different groups of
Transient Orcas
sighted this morning, in the
Galiano and Moresby Island
area!
Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay, BC
*
Today at
2pm
we picked up
4 killer whales
including one male at 48/55 (
Monterey Bay CA
). They were heading steadily WNW at about 6 or 7 knots. We saw
another group of 3 whales
behind them about a half mile away moving in the same direction. We followed the first group for another 2 miles and then caught up with the group of three which consisted of just females/juveniles. We left around 3pm at 48/57. The two pods were closer together when we left but still separate and continued at the same clip heading WNW. There was a pod of 4 gray whales about a mile north of them. I couldn't match any of the shots with the photos I have, so it's a mystery pod as far as I'm concerned! Been a long time since we've seen some good killer whale action so we were pretty thrilled.
Kate Cummings, Blue Ocean Whale Watch
Three of Kate's whales are
CA20, CA54, and CA177
. Two other transients from Kate Cummings' "mystery pod" look like
CA58 and N160
.

We have a house on North Bluff Rd on the
Greenbank beach
side just in the elbow (2923 N Bluff). Around 9am we had
two greys
about 200yds off the beach headed west towards the beach. Then around
1pm
we saw
two greys
on the other side of the harbor from our house cruising east towards baby beach. Very exciting especially this morning's show.
*
I saw
3 gray whales
. West side of Camano Island, near Mabana (I think Lat 48, Long -122),

5:40 pm
, active & feeding, headed north. They stayed within sight until about
7:30pm. This was my first sighting this year. They were very close in, so exciting! We usually see whales in this area every year in the spring. Feeding pits visible when tide is out.

1:38 PM -
Neighbors to our south in
Beverly Beach
reported
gray whale(s)
feeding in front of their houses, moving north, close to shore, shortly before noon. We went down to the beach and followed. Tom is quite sure there were two whales. We followed their rolls and blows north as we walked along the shore. We last saw them off of Saratoga beach, south of the community beach area south of Baby Island, apparently feeding, about

12:45
. What a treat on this beautiful day.

12:10pm -
My husband and I observed what we think is
a grey whale
heading south from
Libby Road Park/Partridge Point
area (west side of Whidbey Island). L/L: 48.232434-122.765973. This solitary whale was first seen about 100 feet from our bluff when a huge spout was seen before it dove. It surfaced again close to the buoy just south of Partridge Point.

One Grey whale
sighted 100 yds off of
Beverly Beach
in Holmes Harbor at

11:40AM
. It appeared to be feeding heading north around the north point of Beverly Beach. We have seen other grey whales feeding in this area during past years.

We found Patch just south of
Camano Head
, and followed him southbound along the east side of
Gedney Island
. We saw
two other grays
blowing in the distance off the Everett waterfront as well.

Today at

9:30
, we spotted
two gray whales
heading south in
Holmes Harbor
, near the old mussel farm. They were on the west side, and were traveling pretty quickly down the shore toward Nichols Boat Yard. We left them at about

10:25
. We believe it was Patch based on his Fluke and Dorsal ID.

Quite certain it was
a gray whale
I just witnessed passing
Eagle Cove (San Juan Island)
, slowly moving north, fairly close to shore. It surfaced 3 times between Granny's Cove and Eagle Point! Lovely exhales!
