Orca Sightings for March 7, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Carolyn Mercer reports
a gray whale
was under the bluff about
10 pm
, near their house on
North Bluff Road
, down the road from us in
Greenbank
.
*
Dick Snowberger, Sandra Pollard and I were about a mile southeast of
Camano Head
in flat calm water, about 8-10 miles from Naval Station Everett, at N48 03.127 W122 20.779 in their boat to record sonars and document gray whales. At
1430
we heard the first pings and began recording on video tape. At first they were at low volume, but they ramped up within a few minutes to very loud. At 1440 we saw
a gray whale
moving southeast about a mile north of us. We watched as the whale approached the
Tulalip
shoreline and continued south. At 1525 we moved about a mile east, toward the whale.
At 1540 the whale began moving north at a rapid pace
. At 1607 we were at N48 04.260 W122 18.895, less than a half mile from shore. There may have been two gray whales within a mile of us at that point.
The sonars were repeated about every 13 seconds, with two bursts of pings for about 6-8 seconds, then about 4-5 seconds of silence before the next pings. With the hydrophone amplifier turned to the lowest possible volume the pings were extremely loud. I shot video, mainly for the sound but with a few glimpses of whales, and Sandra and Dick were shooting ID shots.

Just watching
two, possibly three greys
approximately 1/2 mile offshore, headed slowly toward
Tulare
. They are diving deeply, staying down over 10 minutes and then coming up for about 3-4 blows, then dive down again for 10 minutes. First spotted them in front of
Tulalip Shores
around

10:00 am
. Can still see the blows out our window.
Jim and Vicki Mattson,Tulalip Shores

We had dorsal fins intermittently poking out of our water for 30 mins from

6:15pm
. Fins were all dark, taller than wide, curved, with concave trailing edge. Location was middle of
Totten Inlet
off of entrance to Little Skookum Inlet. 2-4 animals.

These may have been the two Risso's dolphins that have been in south Puget Sound since at least
December 30, 2011. See Cascadia Research Collective for more on these Risso's dolphins.
