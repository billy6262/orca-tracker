Orca Sightings for March 14, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two grays
have been feeding just off shore along the north edge of
Tulalip Shores
. We first heard them blowing about

10:00 this morning
, and they are still feeding now, at
noon
. They have been feeding in close proximity to two amazed and delighted construction workers!
