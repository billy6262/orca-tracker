Orca Sightings for March 5, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just wanted to let you know that late this afternoon, there were
4 Orca in the Port Angeles Harbor
. They were out in the middle and it was so rough out, that a picture opportunity was not to be had. There was an adult male and 2 female and a baby/juvinile. I was so excited to see them even though it was short lived and not the best viewing.. :)
