Orca Sightings for June 8, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Marie Waterman of Washington State Ferries Operations, relayed a report from the crew of the Hyak, of
3 to 5 whales heading south, 3/4 of a mile off Thatcher Pass
(west side of Rosario Strait, opposite Anacortes) at

8:50 pm
.

I started out on the Western Explorer and found part of
J Pod off Pile Point and False Bay area
. Some were actively foraging, some were socializing. On our way back we were looking at seals at Whale Rocks, and in the distance the
other group of J's were rounding around Lopez
heading up island to where the other whales were. They grabbed our attention far away because of all the breaching, tail lobs, and cartwheels that they were doing! We went back to take a quick peek at this group and they started to porpoise quickly! Saw
Granny (J2)
in that group as well. After the trip, I headed out to the west side only to have whales again! (oh darn!) This time when I saw them they were very tucked into shore. I got to watch them swim underwater and play with kelp right under me.

Meanwhile, L pod was heading south:
I did manage to get out on the skiff to see
L-Pod - some K's too, I believe
, but haven't had time to confirm from photos. They were incredibly spread out from just above the Little River ferry terminal by
Comox to Texada
(northern Georgia Strait) and could see breaching down by Denman and Hornby Islands! Also thought there was some splashing almost by Harwood Island. A huge spread! It was like glass and sunny out there so very easy to spot. They would slow down for very short periods of time then pick up the pace again doing about 6 - 7 knots. Guess they got the scent of home territory! Great vocals though, even with the boat noises.
The last few passed the North tip of Texada Island about 5 pm
. Curious as to what time they made it "home".

We saw
4 Orcas feeding in (north) Georgia Strait
on Friday. There were two larger whales quite a ways ahead of two smaller Orcas. They were assumably feeding as they were up and out of the water and then down for 10-20 seconds and sometimes longer, but always surfacing and diving back down. We saw them at

2:35 PM
at about
Bates Beach
area, off the east coast of Vancouver Island, just north of Comox, south of Merville. The larger two were quite a way ahead and last I saw them was just north of the Powell River Ferry Dock on Vancouver Island. The smaller two were about a half mile north of the larger whales. They were all heading
south toward Texada Island
.

Great to see the
J pod
crew passing
Eagle Cove
just after
9am
. They had a little one in tow, and rounded the point on their way up the Haro Strait passing close to shore near the kelp beds. A beautiful sight with which to begin the day!

11:00 am - They're at Cape Mudge
(southern tip of Johnstone Strait, at the north end of Georgia Strait) right now - I hope to get out with them when they get a bit closer.

Single grey whale off Point Roberts at 9 pm
; travelling slowly and heading North. Breathing every five minutes. A small pod of approximately 12 porpoises was also spotted.

7:50 pm - Spotted a single gray whale off Fort Gardner Bay, Mukilteo
. Probably counted 20 + spouts. Just kind of drifting...
