Orca Sightings for June 16, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted a juvenile
humpback whale off of the point at Fort Casey
, Whidbey Island (right in front of the fort) heading north. He was fairly close to shore. He came up several times and put on a show. Also lot's of harbor porpoise's and harbor seals.
Denise Minke(?) off Vashon - We had a whale surface right next to our boat while salmon fishing off Neil Point on the
South end of Vashon Island
on Saturday
morning
. We spotted him several hours later swimming, and zig zagging with a group of racing sailboats in Colvos Passage near Spring Beach. He did not breach and we could not get a picture of it's tail.

We find
J pod
on the westside of
San Juan Island
, moving north. Today the family is moving along in two groups and we have the chance to spend time with both groups! Although there is a lot of traveling behavior, there must also be some fish around as there are several turn around and lots of tail slapping today. We cut out to go around the 1/2 mile no boat zone in front of Limekiln lighthouse and the whales put on speed. Both boat and Orcas arrive at Andrews Bay about the same time. The second group has both J-27, Blackberry, and J-34, Doublestuf crusing along together. The massive black fins appear and then disappear below the surface.

The rain and fog didn't seem to bother
J-Podders
! Of course they've adapted to their wet ocean world. Over the years I have seen more surface active behaviors off of
Henry Island
, compared to other areas, so I was very thankful we were able to see
J-2
, 101 year old matriarch, Granny in the lead of spread out groups. The sprinkles had stopped, the sun broke through the clouds, a whale breached and another's tail fluke slapped the water! Then did Granny vocalize "come here!"? as Balcomb's Orcas porpoised and sped swam toward Granny's groups and Stuart Island.

Rain could not keep us away from the whales today as we departed North out of Friday Harbor. It was a bit foggy as we left, but the further north we went, the clearer it became. Then, just
south of Turn Point we spotted J-2 "Granny"
swimming along Stuart Island by herself. We watched as the 101 year old killer whale surfaced and dived. The
rest of J-pod
wasn't far behind her including
J-27 "Blackberry"
.
