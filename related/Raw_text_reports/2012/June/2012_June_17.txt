Orca Sightings for June 17, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:00 pm - Southern resident whales
spread out among the whitecaps off
Turnpoint Lighthouse
, Stuart Island, with a couple of small, tight-knit groups. Tucker the scat dog had his work cut out among the choppy waves on a beautiful bright, sunny day.

We met
J-pod on the west side of San Juan Island
, northbound, along with a humpback whale! I was able to identify
J2 Granny, L87 Onyx, the J16s and J27
.

J-pod
was also around the San Juan Islands today, and we caught up with some of the Orcas off
Stuart Island
(48ยบ 40.025' N, 123ยบ 13.402' W). The whales were spread out and traveling north. We watched as one whale tail slapped in the distance, and another even partially breached in front of our boat! As we saw different whales, we were able to identify
"Mike" (J-26)
swimming with his mother
"Slick" (J-16)
.

Saw
J Pod
twice and a
Humpback
! It was initially sighted mid
Haro Strait
offshore of Henry-ish island. The seas were too rough to see it there, but we caught a glimpse of it on the second trip about 5 miles south of South Pender Island.
