Orca Sightings for June 11, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
I wonder if the whales have territorial agreements? We don't often sight the different ecotypes of Orcas-Killer Whales in the same area, at the same time. Since Balcomb's Orcas were out of our range, I wasn't surprised to hear
Bigg's Transient Killer Whales
were by the
D'Arcy Islands
at Vancouver Island, Canada. We went for the international tour! T-020, a 49 year old male was with his 44 year old sister,
T-021
. They were quiet and traveling slowly, appearing to be resting at times, with the 2.5' flooding tide. These whales have managed to share their entire long lives, at times surfacing together, shoulder to shoulder, a beautiful sight!

We caught up with
T20 "Kwatsi" and T21 "Pandora"
1.5nm south of
Kelp Reef
(Haro Strait). We followed them as they made their way northward up to
D'Arcy island
. The pair took deep dives, and during most of the encounter were 200-300 yards apart. Just before approaching D'Arcy, they came together and scoped out harbour seals at the southern tip of Little D'Arcy. No kill was witnessed, but the two did disappear for nearly 10 minutes at one point, and the seagulls started to gather at that time, so one would think they were ripping something apart down there ....

It was another beautiful day on the water. The sun was out in full shine, the water pure glass. Out in
Haro Strait
at the very northeastern tip of
D'Arcy Island
we found two Transient Orcas (48°35.77N, 123°15.61W). We identified them as
male T20 and female T21
. Fortunately we were able to watch them hunt for a while.

two minkes
(close to the shallow rock in the middle were a buoy is supposed to be) They were swimming up and down in NE-SE direction. They surfaced with 5 minute intervals. One of them was a pretty big one, the other one was not small either. They had dorsal fins.
