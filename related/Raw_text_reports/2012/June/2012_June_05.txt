Orca Sightings for June 5, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were our on the water last Tuesday (near
Craig, SE Alaska
) and saw
a small pod of 6 orca
at appoximately noon at the junction of Ulloa Channel & Meares Passage Lat/Lon: 55 16.726 N, 133 11.703 W, heading south right tight against the shoreline. Did not see any large (male) dorsals. There were 2 calves in the pod. Both small and one was as tiny as I have ever seen! I was not able to get very good pictures as they were close to shore. Dark whales against a dark shoreline on a very gray morning. But I attached what I was able to enlarge in hope you can identify them. Whales transit this area frequently.
