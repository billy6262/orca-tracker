Our tour took us east to Bellingham Channel where we spent time with at least
7 members of J-Pod
, including
J26 "Mike"
(48°35.11N, 122°40.29W). Initially the whales were spread out across the channel traveling south, although upon our arrival a calf did greet us with two breaches! As the whales traveled through the channel a few individuals lob-tailed while others were suspected of foraging as they changed directions quickly and frequently. By the time we left the whales, 5 individuals had come together and were surfacing in close proximity with each other as they continued traveling south. We even saw "Tucker", a black lab, working with his team of researchers searching for whale scat.

Sad day today with the
beached Humpback Whale in White Rock, BC
. It was heavily entangled in fishing gear.
