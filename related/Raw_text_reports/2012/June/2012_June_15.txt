Orca Sightings for June 15, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cascadia Research conducted surveys with two RHIBs (rigid hull inflatable boats) off the northern Washington coast (15
June 2012) in excellent weather and covering close to 200 nmi. Personnel included Greg Schorr, Erin Falcone, John Calambokidis, and Kiirsten Flynn. Sightings for the two boats included:
12-14 Southern Resident Killer Whales about 20 nmi offshore of La Push
, identifications still pending (will be sent to CWR for confirmation) but included
members of L Pod
including
L77 and her calf
•
4 transient killer whales
• more than
50 humpback whales
mostly in and around Juan de Fuca Canyon
•
20-30 gray whales
feeding in coastal waters mostly
north of La Push
.
Additionally a medium duration LIMPET satellite tag was deployed on one of the humpback whales.
Surveys were conducted as part of a collaborative research effort with WDFW with support from NOAA.

We found the
Southern Resident Orca Whales off Pile Point
, on the west side of San Juan Island. It was
J pod
- or at least some of J pod. It was about

6:15 pm
. The whales would come up for about 3 seconds with a huge exhale and dove right back down again. We gently followed their path south to False Bay. They continued the same behavior of a short exhale/inhale and down for the next 20 minutes or so. We left the orcas there near False Bay just after
7:00 PM. While motoring back to Friday Harbor the Captain spotted a few Harbor Porpoise. They too were quick in coming up and going back down. Lighting was nice. Water smooth like silk. Temperature mild. Ah......summer - at last.

What a day! We didn't have to travel far, getting to enjoy the company of many
members of J-Pod
, with the star being "Big"
Mike, J-26
. We were on the northwest side of San Juan Island at 48° 36.9345 / 123° 11. 8222.
Shachi, J-19
was leading a group of other females north.

9:20am at least 19 orcas

South Lopez toward Iceberg Point

We had an amazing encounter with this large
gang of Transients
. We picked them up in the am on our first tour Southbound through
Seymour Narrows
with the flood tide. Our afternoon tour went out into the upper Salish Sea and found the Gang out between Sentry Shoal and the Little River Ferry Terminal. We left them still Southbound @
1730
hrs. We only left the scene as the S/E wind Was coming up and the tide was turning to ebb. From what I can see we had the
T002C's/T050's/T086's/ T100's/ T101's and T102
! Which makes it
18-19 animals
I think because of the new calf's not in the book!

8:33 pm -
I got to see
orcas
right off
point no point
. What a blessing. Thanks for sharing your sightings. I would guess they were transients because the seals and porpoises all disappeared when the whales showed up.

6:30-
7:30 p.m. -
We first saw the
pod of Orcas in Useless Bay
traveling south. There was a NOAA research boat closely following them. We believe the pod had around 12 family members including at least two males. Most of them were swimming close together. They went under and surfaced approximately every three minutes. They turned around north of Edmonds and swam back in the direction of
Point No Point
. At one point, Orcas were swimming both north and south. The pod swam close enough to shore that when they surfaced, we could hear that burst of air come out of their blowholes. The NOAA vessel was with them the entire time. We would've loved to have been on that boat with them. A few times, it looked like the whales surfaced close enough that one of the researchers could've reached out and touched them. It was still a THRILL to observe these spectacular mammals from the beach!

NOAA researchers left them about

7:50 south of Double Bluff
, still headed north. They identified them as the
T30's
.

5:50 pm -
the orcas have continued south, now veering
toward Double Bluff and Useless Bay
, closer to the Whidbey side now.

4:30 pm - Bush Pt
, Whidbey Island - 1st heard a loud blow, then spotted 1 adult male, sev. females and a calf, swimming south mid-channel
Admiralty Inlet
. GREAT to see and hear whales live and in person!

Paul Kukuk called from
Lagoon Point to say there were 6-7 orcas

5 orcas, including 1 male, milling off Partridge Pt

Three Orcas
just caused a lot of excitement at North Point,
