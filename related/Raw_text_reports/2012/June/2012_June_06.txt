I was trolling off
House Rock (NW of Brookings OR)
, about 42.04, in 48 fathoms. I saw the splashing SW of me, then they (
orcas
) moved to within 1/8 mile of me. They were feeding, including tail slapping, and I saw the
one male
breach once. There were either
two or three females or juveniles
with him.

Just north of
Active Pass
we spotted
a killer whale breach
in the distance! (48° 53.267 N 123° 17.661 W). It was
J-Pod
. The whales were spread out, traveling in small groups of three to four. We watched them for as long as we could before having to make the long trek back. ~Kristen, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris

Out on
Salmon Bank
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, we luckily sighted
2 Minke Whales
zig-zagging about, foraging, being the unpredictable slinky Minkes they are! I try to imagine I am the bait fish they are after, where would I go?
