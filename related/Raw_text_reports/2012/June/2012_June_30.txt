Just found the

Orcas have been loving
Eagle Point
(San Juan Is.) the past few days, and sometimes linger here for hours. Tonight a handful of them slowly, calmly floated around close to shore within the same 100 yard area, for literally hours. I've attached a photo that isn't "good," but it's kinda cool-- I just took it at sunset this evening from the deck because I loved how the light reflected off the whale, making it seem as though it was either on fire, breathing fire, erupting, or had an urban pin-striping muscle car detail job from the local auto garage!

Ten members of J-pod
were seen along the eastern side of
Saturna Island
in Canadian waters today (48°45.2071N, 123°06.9784W). The whales were spread out and traveling north. J2 "Granny", the 101 year old matriarch, was identified among the group. Also L87 "Onyx" was seen traveling with the whales. Onyx is often observed traveling with members of J-pod (L87's mother is L32 (deceased), siblings, L44, L56, L63 (all deceased). Whales were surface active and lobtailing and one whale even breached.

Interesting report from the WA Coast this afternoon (could be Northern or Southern residents, or Offshores):
I received a report from one of our fishery observers this afternoon at

2:15pm
that there were about
50 to 60 killer whales
(best guess) about
1 mile West of Cape Flattery
(he did not give an exact position) and they were traveling Northeast. Sounds like some of them went right by the boat, there were at least 2 very big males but most of the others that were close by were smaller animals. He was not able to get pictures before they were too far away. He also reported at least two humpback whales off of Tatoosh Island, and on our survey last week we
also saw humpbacks
.

Edmonds ferry dock
