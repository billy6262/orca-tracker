Onyx L-87 and all of J pod

We cruised through the Strait of Georgia towards
Point Roberts
with a view of Vancouver in the background. At 48°57.35'N and 123°05.66'W we found
four members of J-pod
. Two males and two females were noted, spread apart as they swam in a consistent direction to the southeast. It is amazing how everyone onboard falls silent to hear these massive mammals breathe as they reach the surface.
