Orca Sightings for June 23, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
10am -
spotted them from
American Camp/Cattle Point
overlook heading west from Lopez at a good pace. We spotted
L87 around
11:00am at Eagle cove
moving steadily northward. The trailers slowed at the north end of South beach, then resumed northward passing Eagle cove about
11:50. We moved up island viewing them from the land bank moving north. We moved to Lime Kiln but they stalled and turned back south and hung out around Hannah Heights. About
2pm
they headed north again and passed the
lighthouse
by
2:30 just as a fierce squall hit with sideways rain, high winds and huge swells. A young one breached 7 times in succession! We made our way to the county park and watched them head north to Andrews Bay area, where they stalled and became very active, breaching, tail lobs etc. They then started moving southward again, so did we. By
6:00pm they were passing Lim Kiln still southerly in groups of 2-4, and they kept coming. I noticed J28 and her babe Star pass, they had not been in the pod earlier so I think they met up north by Andrews Bay (Jeanne said the other group of J's may have been north). We watched what we now believe to be all of
J pod and L87 stream by until
8:15
. When we left they were still streaming southbound.

After rounding Cattle Point heading around the west side of the island, we spotted two members of
J-pod just outside False Bay
. It was an adult female and a smaller whale that looked like a calf. The whales were traveling south but stopped moving and started to dive and surface in one spot. We turned off the boat to watch and see what they were up to. Then, we saw the white underside of the calf's head followed by a squeaky sound. The whale was vocalizing above water! That is something I've never experienced before! The whole boat was silent and focused until the female, who we identified as
J-16 or "Slick"
, changed direction and surprised us by surfacing near our boat's stern. The smaller calf followed, both sticking around for quite some time. It was amazing!

Beautiful calm water today - and right after leaving Anacortes on "Mystic Sea" we found
T's at Thatcher Pass
......
6 or 7 of them
, special thanks to Josh McInnes for ID'ing them, they were the
T49's (T49A3 was the juvenile, plus T49A3, T49B, T49A1, T49A2)
. We then headed towards
Eagle Point where some J-pod
stragglers had turned south, much to our delight, so we spent a half hour or so with Slick and her family, before heading back to port - as the wind picked up and the sunshine turned to the liquid variety.

Bonnie Gretz called at

1:30
with a report of
6 transient orcas south of James Island
, in Rosario Strait.

I was looking out from shore and saw two
humpbacks
. One was about 2 miles off
William Head at about
12:24
and after a hour it went through Race passage at about
13:25. The second sighting was about

13:00
about 3 miles east/southeast of Race Rocks. It looked like it lunge fed or did a low breach, twice, before I lost it. Vincenz Eberl
