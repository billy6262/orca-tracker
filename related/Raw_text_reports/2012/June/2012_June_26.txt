Orca Sightings for June 26, 2012
============================================================

Entry 1:
This
transient Pod
(I have video of a kill) was about
15 strong
and discovered
between 1800 and 2200
. They were heading north through the
San Juan Channel
from about Friday Harbor until sunset north of Waldron Island.

These
two gangs
came through
Campbell River
today southbound. They are not animals that i can say i have ever see come through here actually. Without the new guide book and the digital copy on my computer now i wouldn't ave been able to figure them out, hope i got them all right Mostly they were just traveling through the area today. The most action we witnessed was some speed swimming past the entrance to the Campbell itself. Excited to see this gang through...means
in 2 days we had 24 different Biggs (Transient) Killers in our area!

J pod and a few L's went slowly north in Haro Strait
.

We then went around the top of San Juan Island and saw our first
killer whale just off Henry Island
, traveling north west (48 35.480'N 123 12.887'W). There were two of them and they seemed to be propoising out of the water and traveling fast. We then noticed we could see dorsal fins off in every direction. We spotted two large males, one of which was L-92 "Crewser," and also around was L-41 "Mega" and L-26 "Baba." After watching them for some time, and cruising across the US border into Canadian waters, we took the scenic route back to Friday Harbor, going between Stuart and Johns Island and the eastern side of Spieden.

We left this morning with the report of
whales at turn point
southbound. By the time we got there the whales had made it almost down to Eagle Point but luckily another group of
J's
were found along the
Pender Island
Bluffs! When we first arrived on scene, the whales were VERY active. I was able to ID
J2, J8, L87 and the J16's
. Breaching, cartwheels, spyhops, even double spyhops!

A note about the
gray whale in Puget Sound
reported by Stephanie Raymond aboard the Clipper III, at
8:20 am heading north just south of West Point, just north of Seattle. Based on the barnacle patterns on the head, I was able to confirm that
the gray whale we saw on 6/26 off West Point was the same one we saw off Point No Point on 6/11
.
