We first caught up with
"Granny" (J2)
and one other female and watched as they surfaced and dove under. We then caught up with a male killer whale at 48ยบ 53.31' N, 123ยบ 02.87' W who lob-tailed, exposing the bottom half of his large, fusiform body. Once he surfaced to breath I was able to identify him as
"Blackberry" (J27)
who is 21 this year. He surfaced a few more times before rolling over, giving us an amazing view of his giant, paddle like pectoral fins. We then started to head back, enjoying the sunshine, flat water, and company all the way to San Juan Island.
