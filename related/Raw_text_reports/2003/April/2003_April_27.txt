Orca Sightings for April 27, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research was able to ID one of the transients off S. Whidbey on 4/27/03 (many thanks to Mark Tavelli for sending us his photos):
The one female that there is a okay picture for, I believe is T122 who often hangs with the T46's.

Time observed:
0800 to 1000
Location: Mukilteo and Clinton ferry landing mid-channel
Number or Orcas: 6 to 10
Direction of travel: Observed over 2 hours in the same location
Interesting note: Orcas appeared to be training younger Orcas how to attack a sea lion
My son and I observed a group of 6 to 10 Orcas mid-channel between Mukilteo and Clinton. The small pod had a large live sea lion surrounded and appeared to be working with their young Orcas possibly training to hunt and kill the very large sea lion.
Observed the following:
The larger Orcas would strike the sea lion and completely knock the sea lion out of the water sometimes flipping the sea lion in the air end to end then simply swim away and let the younger Orcas work with the sea lion. At times the Orcas would pull the sea lion under for 5 to 10 minutes then re-appear. The younger Orcas would jump on top or swim over the sea lion.
The small pod had at least 2 or more fairly large males and 2 or more large female plus 2 or more younger and much smaller Orcas.

. - J pod passed traveling very quickly, porpoising, breaching, tail slapping, the works! AND we saw the new baby traveling with a very tight group of 7-8 - there was quite a bit of swimming upside down by a couple of the wee ones!

6 pm
- At least a dozen 50 feet off the beach, right out front, and another dozen or so out deeper. With a huge pink run in September, and a reasonable sockeye run this summer, we'll be seeing them alot.
