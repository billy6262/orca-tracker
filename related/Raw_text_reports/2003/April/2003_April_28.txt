Orca Sightings for April 28, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...with Jpod for a short period this afternoon as they "woke up" they were all bunched up crossing Open bay towards Henry Is. A few turned to the East, J1 turned to the West, the rest stopped and milled. Then they all turned back South with breaching and a great show of exuberance.
