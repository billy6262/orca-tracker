Orca Sightings for April 25, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Greenbank Postmaster had orcas in front of their home (east side of Greenbank, Whidbey Island) on Friday, Saturday & Sunday mornings (4/25, 4/26, 4/27) - she said it looked like it was a pod of ~4.

I found T61(Victor) heading west out the Juan de Fuca within a half mile of East Sooke Park. He was moving at a good clip with the outgoing tide. There was an earlier report from a fisherman that there were a few transients off of Victoria waterfront. We did not find any others as they were probably out ahead of Victor.

... Cattle Point (So. end of San Juan Is.). They were headed North... then suddenly they turned back South... then headed back North again. Very spread out... Maybe 2 miles between the first group and the last? and some were way out in Haro... none were close enough to shore really. Though one male was in kind of close... J1? While up the West Side and all the way to the County Park... when in the car I had 89.1 FM (live orca calls) on... never heard a call once. Some echolocation but that was all.

We had J-Pod today right in front of Anacortes at
1pm
. The pod was spread out in Rosario Strait and traveling south. As they turned around the corner of Lopez Island we were able to view most of the pod including, Ruffles, Granny, Blossom and her new calf J-39. Great to see both the old girl and the new sprout today!

Mary Pacher called again at

saying the 3 gray whales were still feeding off N. Bluff Rd, Hidden Beach area. At
1:3
0 she said they were heading south toward our place, so I went out and there they were, right below the bluff! We watched the whales feed from

1:30 - 4 pm
, busily feeding the whole time - can't wait to see the feeding pits at low tide. They just kept zigzagging back and forth, north & south, east & west, flopping around with flippers and flukes in the air - it was wonderful! I was able to identify one of them as "Patch", and one of the three seemed smaller.
