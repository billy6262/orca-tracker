We live on the shore of Hood Canal at the mouth of Little Anderson Creek (halfway between Bangor and Seabeck). This morning we sighted an orca about 2/3 of the distance between us and Brinnon. The sighting came about in this fashion. My wife is a birder. She was scoping the birds in the canal at about

10:00 a.m.
and noticed a great activity of gulls. As she continued to observe, there was a large splash occurring every few minutes with the dorsal fin showing occasionally. My wife saw head and body. My son and I took binoculars and also observed the event. We interpreted the activity as being an orca feeding on a seal with the gulls attracted to the remnants. We continued to observe for about 30 minutes. We can testify to only one orca. The event occurred about 1 mile south of Oak Head on Toandos Peninsula.
