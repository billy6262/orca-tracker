Wednesday
April 2, and a killer whale surfaced about 20 feet from his boat at Octopus Point! He was startled. There were 4 in the group. (He thinks 2 moms and 2 kids). They followed him South in Sansum Narrows, hugging the Vancouver Island side of the Narrows. He saw more blows at Hope Point(near Burial Island) on the Salt Spring Island side of the Narrows. He thinks c. 4 in each group.
