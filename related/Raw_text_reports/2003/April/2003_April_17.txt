today, northbound slowly in resting formation.

And Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales was with Gray Whales today - he called in to report 3 grays off the south end of Whidbey Island, about 3 miles south of the Clinton Ferry, heading north at

2:30 pm
.
*
7.30 AM
whales cruising through Maple Bay on their way North towards Crofton. (this area is in Sansum Narrows, between SaltSpring Island & Vancouver Island, north of Victoria). I would estimate at least 6 to 10.

4-5 gray whales feeding and moving slowly past Langley. We saw them off of the Inn at Langley at

6:30 am
, followed them east toward town and lost them in the deeper water.

We encountered J-Pod just south of Lime Kiln. As we watched Blossom and her brand new calf, J-39 (just 2 weeks old), swim past the bow of the boat she lifted the entire baby orca out of the water with her nose!!! We got a great look at the new baby's belly and I hope my photograph taken of this event may aid in determining the sex of the whale. Very exciting!
