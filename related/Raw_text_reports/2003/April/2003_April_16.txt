Jpod going S. off the West side of San Juan Is. my encounter started at
1501
at Pile Pt. The whales were reported earlier further N. I was not off the dock in Victoria until 1400 but they were southbound at that time. All seemed normal at that time.

, one gray whale spotted going past Tulalip Shores, about 1/2 mile offshore, heading north. Then again at

5:00pm
, two large whales were slowly working their way north about 200 yards off Tulalip Shores. They were feeding and finning and stayed in the neighborhood for about 2 1/2 hours, rounding the corner and out of sight, still heading north, about

This morning at
10 am
there is a whale diving and blowing in Possession Sound east of Whidbey island, just north of Possession Beach, close to the Whidbey shoreline. Not showing much of himself, and hidden by some trees between us, so no real identification possible.

Jim Maya just called to alert us here at the Highland Inn that J-pod is below. My guests are thrilled to see them and to hear them blowing. They seem to be moving slowly along the west side of San Juan Island towards Lime Kiln Lighthouse.
