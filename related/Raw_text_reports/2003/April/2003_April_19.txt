J pod is here again today, but you already know that. I first heard them at
0746
going north, they went up to Kellett Bluff and turned around and went south with the outgoing tide. They are probably off Eagle Point by now (
1330
).

Just got back from a great visit with the Orcas. We started about

10:30 am
and finished around

3:00 pm
. We first saw the whales off South Beach (south end of San Juan Island), followed them to Eagle Cove and then waited for them at Lime Kiln.

7:30am
- J Pod is about mid - channel in front of Kens (Center for Whale Research, west San Juan Island) going north. Hope they stick around again. There is evidence of a lot of fish and a lot of bait. If they don't have to travel so far this time of year to find enough food it sure helps their situation.

7:30 AM
: Just saw three greys feeding heartily about 75 yards off our deck heading towards Langley. Highest tide seems to be the ticket.
