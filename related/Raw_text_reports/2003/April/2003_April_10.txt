From the

6:30pm
Mukilteo to Clinton run: There were two grays milling about a half a mile off the Mukilteo shoreline just north of the ferry route. One presented a good view of unbroken back from spout to fluke. They were keeping close company, but did not appear to be in a hurry to get anywhere. Average time down between spouts was 2-3 minutes, and the spouts came from the two whales came in quick succession as they surfaced. Ciao!
