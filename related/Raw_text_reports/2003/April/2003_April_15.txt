Robert Stonefelt called this morning to report 1 Gray Whale at

8:15 pm
at Mariner's Cove (NE of Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) feeding & heading south toward Polnell Pt & Oak Harbor.

4:30 pm
Went out to the bluff to see if we could find the 3 grays reported by Barbara - and we found another Gray north of Cama Beach headed south toward Camano Island State Park. We saw the other 3 grays, though they were WAY on the other side, hugging the Camano shoreline. At about
5 pm
, just as they got close to Elger bay, they turned and headed south. When we left a little after 5, the single gray was nearing Camano Island State Park and still headed south.

We talked to Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research while we were watching the grays, and they were watching & listening to J pod as they headed south past the Center (~

4:45pm
)

We found a group of transients milling off Stuart Island at about
11 a.m
. They went down on a long dive, and J Pod came up where they had been. The transients then went west across Haro Strait with the J's following behind. At Mantare Island, the transients turned north, and the J's continued to follow them. At Gooch, the transients turned west again, and the J's continued to pursue them, with both groups porpoising, and the J's slowly gaining on the transients. At the west end of Gooch, the transients turned south briefly, but actually headed north. The J's milled for a while where the transients made this move, then headed north as well. At the north end of the group of little islands, the transients headed west again. However, the J's continued north a little ways and stopped to rest. We left the transients as the Annie Mae pulled up, and from the radio chatter it sounded as though additional whales may have joined them. The J's headed east after their nap, then turned south back to Gooch, and then headed back to Stuart and on to San Juan Island, where they passed Limekiln Lighthouse headed south from about

4:15-
5:15.

T14 (04) transient, off Victoria going from west to east
most of the afternoon
, left him 5 miles S.S.E. of Hein Bank. Had heard of the whales off Gooch Is. but my info was they were not J's but transients. Started North for Dall's when reports came in of J's coming S. in Spieden Ch. and the Transients going N.E. Meet Jpod in Andrews Bay very far apart but going S. Never did see J1 or the new calves but only on scene for 15-20 min. Great Dall's show in mid Haro on the way back to Victoria.

Patrick of Bon Accord Charters called to report seeing a pod of 5 or 6 orcas, including 1 large male, from the Sidney/Friday Harbor ferry today
at noon
(sounds like it could be J pod?). He said they were south of Gooch Island, heading north up the east side toward the Gulf Islands.
