Orca Sightings for May 5, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod went north today, & the US Navy was going north as well, pinging like crazy. The whales behaved very peculiarly, and the pod split up - J 17 et al looked like they were forced south, the rest went north. The sounds we were hearing from the hydrophones were incredible, and we documented the event on videotape.

...about 1

1:30 a.m
., I saw two gray whales off South Whidbey between Randall Point (north of the ferry dock) and Waterman's Dock. They were quite close together the entire time I saw them and both appeared to be adult size. They were moving about in the same area,, possibly feeding, and which was several hundred yards offshore. They varied between shallow dives and some longer dives. They continued this way until a motorboat sped by very very close. I feel certain the boat was not at all aware of the whales' presence. Then the whales were down for quite a while and started moving north after they resurfaced.
