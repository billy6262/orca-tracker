Orca Sightings for May 30, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pseudo-Orca? Friday,
May 30th we encountered an interesting, and unconfirmed cetacean sighting off the west side of San Juan Island. We were watching J-Pod in a resting pattern just north of Pile Pt. when a Canadian zodiac got on the radio & said he saw a cetacean surface just ahead of the orcas close to the shore. A few of our guests saw the animal and the radio-talk leaned toward identifying the animal as a pseudo-orca. I was unable to see the animal myself, but there was definitely something there. If it was a Foster or another lone cetacean is unknown....did anyone else see this animal? If so, please add to this sightings report.

We left J Pod at
7 PM
, just south of the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, headed south, with the winds increasing. They flip-flopped all day, between Cattle Pass and Henry Island.
