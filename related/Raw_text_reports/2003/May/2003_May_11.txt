Orca Sightings for May 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Cher Renke reports an orca Mom & calf off American Camp (SW San Juan Island) heading north at

8:15 am
, porpoising at a fast rate of travel, with no other whales around that she could see. Mom did a breach. At

8:20
they had reached Eagle Cove. She saw Mom orca breach 4 or 5 times.
*
Ken Balcomb at the Center for Whale Research reported orcas heading north past the Center between
10 &
10:30 am
, very spread out, so it is likely the Mom & calf were just trailing behind the others.
