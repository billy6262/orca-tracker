Orca Sightings for May 13, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Spent time with J pod today. Caught up with them about
1345
on the north end of San Juan Island. J-1 was with a small group there. Further down we had J-8 and her entire family. J-11's new calf looked pink and very energetic. The J's were split up into three groups that were back and forth along the west side when we were with them. They spent a lot of time traveling or hunting underwater, could have been either. We observed a few animals doing the backstroke at the surface and J-1 did sort of a half breach at one point. Around
1530
the most southern group turned back (they were just south of Lime Kiln) and headed NO. (J-17 and J-22).
We also had a large Minke feeding off of Burrow's Island on the way home. Observed a few harbor porpoises SO end of Lopez Island.
