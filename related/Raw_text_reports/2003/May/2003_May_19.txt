Orca Sightings for May 19, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Observed J-pod passing through Active Pass yesterday afternoon. They were still heading North when we left them. They were traveling very close together. It was my first observation of them transiting Active Pass. The Pass is quite narrow and the Canadian ferries run through there so I wonder if that is a common method for them to make sure everyone gets through. The whale watch boats were polite. Lots of private traffic. We observed M3 keeping an eye on proceedings but did not notice them approaching anyone while we were passing through. Little J-39 was very energetic and showed us a lot of (his/her) chin and belly...but not close enough or the right angle to make out the calf's gender. The whales did spread out a bit after they cleared the pass by about a quarter mile. They did a little "porpoising" and a breach.

The Island Explorer went through Active Pass with J-Pod around

3:00 pm
. After heading through the pass the whales headed north towards the Fraser River. With the big ebb tide, we expect to see them on our-side-of-the-pond today. We will give you an update on what the day brings.

We left J Pod south of Pt. Roberts, heading south, at

8:15 PM
. I would suspect that they will be on the sourh or west side of San Juan Island in the morning. They had gone through Active Pass at about

3:30 PM
and usually head north to the Fraser River, but instead headed toward the Coal Docks and then headed south. We picked them up at

6:30
near Pt. Roberts.

Susan: Given the recent concern about harbor porpoise, I thought I'd pass along the following. Two dozen harbor porpoise seen today by Anita Lopez (NOAA Corp officer from NMML) between Edmonds & Kingston around

6:05am
this morning. Middle of shipping lanes. Are they typically found in this particular area?

I talked to Candi Emmons this morning, & J pod was heading north past the Center for Whale Research at

9:45 am
.

We saw two big blows and nice fluke display from the Mukilteo ferry at

1:05 pm
. Could have been one whale or two (Grays) south of the ferry, perhaps a quarter of a mile, within a mile of the Mukilteo side.
