Orca Sightings for May 8, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...around

8:15pm
two grays were just offshore. It appeared at first that they were swimming separately, as their courses seemed so different. But then, the one heading north changed course, swam south and met up with the other one, both continuing south.
