Orca Sightings for May 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod off west coast of San Juan Island between Pile Pt. and Edwards Pt. heading north this afternoon. Our naturalist identified J11 with J27, J31 and the baby J39; J16 with J33 and J26 who breached; J22 with baby J38; and J17; and J1 (Ruffles) came right up to and under our boat. What a thrill to see them.

Observed J-Pod from Salmon Bank to Pile Point, spread out and then coming together at about

13:00
hours with a few breaches and some upside down swimming splashing and tail lobbing. And a Minke whale off shore about a quarter mile away.

After flipping and flopping all day, J Pod was heading north at

5:00 PM
past Henry Island. In other news, a dead young Harbor Porpoise was spotted early this afternoon off of False Bay (San juan island). We were able to retrieve it. Ken Balcomb took it to the Friday Harbor Lab where necropsies are being performed on several other porpoises. When and if I get any results, I will let you all know what they are. Several dead porpoises have been found since the recent sonar incident.

Tonight at

7:00
a single gray whale came close to shore past Tulalip shores. It was on a dedicated course to Spee-be-dah, where finning and feeding behaviors were displayed.

This morning we received a message about whales off Clinton (S. Whidbey Island) headed south toward Possession Pt. at
8 am
. The first part of the message was cut off, but I'm pretty sure the caller was reporting a gray whale or whales.
