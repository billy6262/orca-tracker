Orca Sightings for May 1, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gene Carey of Hartstene Island (north of Olympia) called to report 4 orcas traveling north in Pickering Passage from

9:45 - 10 am
. He said there was 1 adult, 2 smaller orcas and 1 juvenile in the pod. This is their second sighting of orcas, the first being last December (we had several reports of transients in the Olympia area the week before Christmas).

J pod
came around the south end of Lopez to Salmon Bank during mid-morning through mid-day while a large group of
Offshores
was apparently up in the Gulf Islands or Boundary Pass. Late in the day J pod continued north along the shore of San Juan Island and Henry Island as the Offshores headed south in Haro Strait spread out in subgroups mostly on the western side. The closest point of approach was around
1730
? When J pod was in a tight resting group near Kellet Bluff, while the Offshores were in many groups spread out from mid Haro Strait to D'Arcy Island. The offshores were vocalizing, so J pod must have heard them. This is another example of these different types of killer whales not intermingling when there was opportunity. Very interesting, and quite different from what we would expect had K or L pod come that close to J pod party time! We last saw the Offshores heading toward Oak Bay around 2030, still vocalizing.

Ken, Dave, and Candy (Center for Whale Research) are way too busy in the basement with photos of Offshores to be reporting for awhile but Ken said he recognized at least eight to ten from this pod last year. Judging from the numbers I would say they are all the same Orcas assuming they stay in the group like residents and I see no reason to think otherwise. This would be their fourth or fifth trip inland in the last about 18 months. Ken and I left the Offshores about

5:00
and headed in. We were probably three miles off Kellet Bluff when we left them. We ran into J Pod at Kellet Bluff. They were grouped tight together and moving north. All were there and looking good, acted just like normal. As we were watching them I looked across and could see Dave and Candy in Orca (small boat) about two miles off and assume they were with the Offshores as they wanted a few last minute shots. I think Dave said he had about 364 [digital photographs] which isn't near enough. With Candys 400 or so and Kens 350 you know why we won't hear from them for awhile. Anyway, I think we can start assuming these guys definitely don't intermingle. I saw no signs of J Pod even being excited. I'm sure this isn't their first encounter. For us, a lot of excitement. For J2, Granny, at 90+ just another day on the block.

Between about

8:00am and
10:00am
on the North tip of Harstine Island in the South Sound, looking west onto Pickering Passage, the Orcas had reached the North tip of the island, had rounded the island, and were heading south in Case Inlet. They lost sight of them as they neared Heron Island. They were first seen about 1 mile north of the Harstine Island Bridge, swimming north in Pickering Passage (between the island and the mainland to the west). They must have then rounded the north tip of the island as they were next reportedly seen swimming south in Case Inlet, which is the water to the east of Harstine Island. From the people I have spoken to, they were last seen swimming toward Heron Island, a small island just off of Harstine Island. Guess that they were just on a little jaunt around Harstine Island.

From the reports, it appears that there were at least 4 Orcas (seen at once) and maybe up to six. One woman was quite sure that there may have been a baby or juvenile with the pod from the size comparison when it surfaced along side a larger (or so it appeared to her) one.

had report of 6 killer whales (no males) in so. Puget Sound off Steilacoom heading south on 4/30 and in Still Harbor off McNeil Island on 5/1. Whales were reported chasing seals at the Gertrude Island haulout in Still harbor. Observer reported whales coming up on the beach and chasing seals up on beach. Apparently seals were fleeing out of the water.

...whales passed by on Moat Point (west side of N.Pender Island) tonight at around

9:35 pm
. ...in the darkness, there appeared to be at least six. They seemed to be 'transiting' northward.

2:00 pm
- lots of whales were seen at Turn Point on Stuart Island headed south. The Center for Whale Research is on site so we may hear some official information soon. Shane didn't recognize any of the whales, so they could be offshores -
