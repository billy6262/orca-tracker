Orca Sightings for May 18, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Enjoyed watching the J-pod
9-
10:30 am
. There were about 11 orcas, including Ruffled fin male, females, youths and a baby. They were feeding northward past Limekiln Lighthouse on the W. Coast of San Juan Island. The whale research boat was there filming. The orcas moved northward in a tight group, turned offshore of Henry Island and then fed southward. As more spectator boats appeared [some, too close], the pod split into three smaller groups and several whales displayed the slapping actions of being bothered.
Thank you for your web site.

So sorry I did not see this until today. I was so busy watching whales all day that I never turned on my computer Sunday. We saw two grays southwest of the mouth of Cultus Bay, remaining in the area between
11AM and 3PM
. They appeared to move eventually toward the northeast (toward Possession Point). Then again, at

4:30
we noticed a gray in the same area. Whether it was one of the same coming back to feast on whatever was so tasty in the area, or a different whale foraging in the same area, we do not know. These grays were well offshore, but were still attracting the attention of local boaters. All seemed to keep a respectful distance.

J POD passed by Low Island/San Juan County Park from

6:45AM-
7:30AM
, very slowly and very spread out. Then they turned around and headed back South towards False Bay.

At

2:00pm
a single gray was spotted between Tulalip Shores and south Camano Island. It lingered in the area for about 30 minutes and finally headed south. Then at

7:20pm
, two grays came by just offshore from Tulalip Shores. They were headed north into the waters off Spee-bi-dah, where they finned and fed along the shore.
