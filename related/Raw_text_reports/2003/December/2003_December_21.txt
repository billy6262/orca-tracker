Orca Sightings for December 21, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We heard back from Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research, who was able to ID all members of K pod off Pt. Wilson Sunday afternoon - then a little before
4 pm
they turned and headed south, just as they did earlier in the week.

Whales off west Whidbey. Elsa Leavitt of Bush Pt, Whidbey Island, just called in at

11:50 am
to report a pod of orcas off Bush Pt, heading north. We'll see if we can get over to take a look, and Ken Balcomb is out in his boat looking for fins, so hopefully we'll have more info. and ID's for you soon -

12:35 pm:
We found the orcas off Lagoon Pt, west Whidbey Island. Very spread out, traveling north, doing lots of splashing and foraging, and swimming back and forth.

1:45 pm:
The whales were approaching Ft. Flagler, still spread out, but closer to the Ft. Flagler side, continuing north.

2:15 pm:
The orcas were in front of Port Townsend, very spread out, making themselves scarce and hard to see.

2:30 pm:
The orcas continued north, between Port Townsend and Pt. Wilson, some great breaches happening, just as Ken Balcomb caught up with them!

2:45 pm:
The whales were off Pt. Wilson, and Ken has Identified them as K pod. We left them at about 3 pm, in Ken's hands, as they were getting too distant for us to see (except for the breaches!).
