Orca Sightings for December 26, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
10 am
Number of animals seen?
Approx. 6, most traveling in pairs, a couple were solo and on the outskirts...
Where did you see them (latitude and longitude if possible)?
I had the awesome pleasure of being on the
9:35 Eastbound Ferry, leaving Bainbridge to Seattle, we were in the middle of the crossing.
What direction were they traveling?
They, initially, were heading towards Elliott Bay. But headed south, when they found themselves in the unfortunate position of being in the middle of the East bound Ferry, to the south, the West bound Ferry to the North and a large cargo ship to the east, heading to into port. A small john boat with two men followed them from the west, then turned and went quickly off in the direction of Eagle Harbor. When the whales were penned in...they then turned south. Their sonar must have been going nuts. I was on the port side of the boat on the lower cardeck and had the distinct pleasure of a mother and baby breach then dive right at the side of the boat in front of me.
When did you see them (date and time of day)?
12/26 approx.
10am
...in the middle of the sound.
W
hat were they doing? Playing? Feeding (on what)?
They were cruising along, with much breaching, almost in parallel to each other, but spread out.
Were there any males (very large fin on their back)?
Believe there might have been two on the outskirts...

Melanie Salonin of Vashon Island called in a report of a pod of orcas off NE Vashon Island passing Beals Pt. heading north at

1:50 pm
. She reported 3 females and a calf swimming by close to the shore, with at least 4 others swimming further out, spread out, doing some lob-tailing.
