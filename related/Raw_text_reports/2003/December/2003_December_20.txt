Orca Sightings for December 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Hogan called in a report of 10 - 12 orcas off the west side of Vashon Island today - at

2:15 pm
, he had them in Colvos Passage headed north, about 3/4 of the way up the island; at
4 pm
, they had turned around and were heading south through Colvos Passage (the first time that Jeff has observed them traveling south through the passage - they always seem to travel north). He was unsure of ID's, but maybe K pod?
