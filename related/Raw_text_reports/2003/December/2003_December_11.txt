Orca Sightings for December 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Finally had to pull myself away at about

4:30
.. Whales were on the Tacoma side of the Vashon / Tacoma ferry run. Rick Frye and I watched them for hours down there. One moment they were about to take the turn down to the narrows, the next they were headed nearly up Colvos passage and the next they had all turned completely around and headed east only to do it all over again leaving a complete mystery as to which way they decided to go. Last I saw they were still headed West.

11:20 am
- Jeff Hogan called to say it's K pod off Vashon Island. They just passed the Pt. Robinson Lighthouse & were still headed south. Youngster K36 was looking bright & orange, and there were some breaches happening for the crowd of about 30 lucky people watching from the shore!
*

11:37 am
- Rick Frye of Vashon Island called to report on the whales - he had just left Pt. Robinson and was further south at Gold Beach, watching the whales as they continued south, further out from shore. Closer to shore he saw two small groups of Dall's Porpoise heading north.
*

12:35 am
- Jeff Hogan called again to report K pod at the south end of Vashon Island, still heading south, and still traveling very spread out.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales just called - his wife Amanda saw a pod of orcas from the Vashon Ferry at

8:50 am
, off the east side of Vashon Island heading south. No ID's yet, (probably J's as that's who has been around) but thought we'd let you know they're there so those of you down south can run to the beach with your binocs! Also, a
little blurb on our Urban Orcas
from the Seattle Times today -
