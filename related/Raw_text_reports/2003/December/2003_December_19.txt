Orca Sightings for December 19, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted two groups of Orcas today as follows:
0930
. Saw two females in Admiralty Inlet (approximately one mile southeast of Marrowstone Point). They were headed north along the tide line. Observed some tail slapping.
1230
. Saw a pod of at least six females and one male in Admiralty Inlet mid-channel between Marrowstone and Whidbey Islands (at the southern end of Marrowstone). The pod was headed south. Quite a bit of tail slapping.

I found the orcas between Lagoon Pt, Whidbey Island, & Ft. Flagler at

10:15 am
. They were very spread out, actively foraging, but mainly heading in a northerly direction. I thought I saw a large male that could've been J1, but he was WAY on the other side, so can't be sure - but it looked like the same pod that passed by Whidbey two days ago, & likely the pod that was off Vashon and Bainbridge Islands yesterday.

Susan, there is a pod of Orca South of Lagoon Point, North of Bush Pt. near mid channel. Too far for me to see much other than the Victoria Clipper stopped to take a watch. I can not even tell what direction they are traveling. (

Elsa Leavitt just called at
9 am
to report a pod of orcas (likely the same pod that went by Weds.) heading north off Bush Pt., west Whidbey Island.
