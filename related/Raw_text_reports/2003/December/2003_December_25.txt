Orca Sightings for December 25, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our family saw the orcas in Penn Cove on Christmas Day. We counted 6 tall fins and watched the whales having a marvelous time for awhile - around

3:30 pm
. We watched them from Monroe Landing, at first, and then followed the road to San de Fuca road and back to the landing.

We had what looked like two groups of whales in Penn Cove at approximately

3:15pm
. We watched them for about 10 mins. until they headed further into the cove and we lost them in the sun. We never saw them come out of the water but could very plainly see them spouting.
