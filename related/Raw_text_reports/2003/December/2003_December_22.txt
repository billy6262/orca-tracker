Orca Sightings for December 22, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found the pod of orcas reported earlier just off Lagoon Pt, west Whidbey Island, at
4 pm
heading south at a pretty good pace - not foraging and milling like they were yesterday. It looked like probably K pod again, from what I could see in the late afternoon light. Those of you southward, listen for them tonight and let's all look for them again tomorrow~

Hi, just observed 6-7 Orcas passing north beach and Point Wilson (near Port Townsend), heading south about
1415
. One or two large females the rest were smaller.
