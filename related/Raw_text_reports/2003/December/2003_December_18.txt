Orca Sightings for December 18, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters, who had a report from Chris Sly of Bainbridge Island that J pod was off Yeomalt Pt, SE Bainbridge Island at 10 am. The orcas were close to the Bainbridge side, heading south.

We've received some updates on the orcas travels down south from Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales:

1:30 pm
- the pod was off NE Vashon Island near Dilworth, and still heading south - so all you Vashon orca fans get out to the beach on this beautiful day to see some blows & fins!

2:45 pm
- The orcas are just north of Pt. Robinson, SE Vashon/NE Maury Island, foraging
