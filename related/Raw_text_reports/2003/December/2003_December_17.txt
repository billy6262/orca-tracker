Orca Sightings for December 17, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I received a call from Elsa Leavitt reporting a pod of orcas off Bush Pt, west Whidbey Island, heading south at a little after 2 pm. She saw one large male, & said the orcas were closer to the Whidbey side. I'm taking off to see if I can find & ID them - all of you on S. Whidbey & down into Puget Sound should be on the lookout for fins!

I found the pod of orcas just south of Bush Pt, west side of Whidbey Island at about

2:45 pm
. They were very spread out, except for one tight group of six that were almost on top of each other! I counted at least 15 whales, and though I didn't see any BIG male fins, I saw one or two that looked like they could be sprouters, and two sets of Moms/calves. They were mostly moving south, but doing a lot of feeding under the surface, some of them turning north occasionally, but when I left them at

3:30 pm
they still seemed to be heading south slowly, getting so spread out and spending so much time under the surface it was too hard to watch, count, ID or videotape! But what a treat to see a pod off Whidbey with the setting sun - truly a beautiful day, and some much-needed good whale news.
