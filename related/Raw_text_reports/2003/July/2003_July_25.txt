Orca Sightings for July 25, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod and I think K pod off westside of San Juan Island, just south of Lime Kiln. Definitely was J pod, saw both babies. There were breaches, spy hops and LOTS of porpoising 3 or 4 together. Also, Big Ruffles was there and he was rolling around alot and through my binoculars I could definitely confirm that he was in an amorous mood, if you get my drift. Big as life!!
