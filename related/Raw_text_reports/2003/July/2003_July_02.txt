Orca Sightings for July 2, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
The L12's were joined by the K's yesterday (
July 2). Mega (L41) appears to have a cut about 6-8" long, about a foot or two from his fluke on his right dorsal side. Yesterday it seemed slightly wider than today. It doesn't seem too bad.

We had the extended L12 group foraging near Salmon Bank on Wednesday 7/2. Skana sure is getting big! I heard a few other operators talking on the radio, so I know some people are aware of it but Mega has a pretty noticeable cut on his right side between his saddle patch and tail. I didn't get a very close look at him that day but from what I could tell it looked to be at least a few days old and not too serious. Did anyone else out there get a better look at it? (see previous report) It's probably something to keep an eye on, especially with his immune system potentially compromised from PCB's.
