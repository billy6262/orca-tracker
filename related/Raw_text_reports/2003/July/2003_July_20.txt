It was a long haul from Anacortes to Race Rocks, but we finally came into the presence of many whales. I think J, K, and L pods were there. ...we were only able to observe them for a few minutes before they headed out to sea.

Well, it appears that the residents have decided to hang out around Race Rocks all day. They appeared to be heading back towards San Juan Island and then around

3:30
did a turn around and went back to Race Rocks. As we were going back towards Friday Harbor in San Juan Channel, we had a Minke Whale feeding in the calm waters.

Dale Martinis of Private Boat Tours called this afternoon with a cacophany of whales in the background - all three pods, 2 miles off Becher Bay (near Race Rocks), moving eastward. He said they were foraging, playful and talkative - sounds like a Superpod!
