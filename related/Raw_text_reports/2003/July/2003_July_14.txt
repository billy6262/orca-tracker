I took my troop of Girl Scouts aboard the Mystic Sea for a trip out to see the whales. It could not have possibly gone any better. There was a superpod off San Juan Island, with much breaching, tail lobbing, spy hopping, and pec slapping. Even some mating activity (one mom's experience - hey, what's that big pink thing? Uh, its a.....salmon, yeah, a salmon...) These second and third grade girls will remember this the rest of their lives. Also a minke, harbor seals, and harbor porpoise.
