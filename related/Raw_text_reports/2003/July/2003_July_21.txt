============================================================

Entry 1:
L-57 and many more L's milling around and headed back toward Waldron Island about
1330
. ...from Boundary Pass, south past Waldron, and right down San Juan Channel! It's always a great sight to see orca cruise the shoreline of San Juan and go right by the entrance to Friday Harbor. Left them going south toward Turn Island about
1700
hrs.
