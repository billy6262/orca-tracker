Orca Sightings for July 26, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we saw feeding, milling, and even some breaching right in San Juan Channel near Yellow Island. A repeat of last weeks visit by L-Pod you ask? Actually, it was a minke whale! No reports of any of our black and white orca friends today. But at least the day wasn't completely whale-less!
