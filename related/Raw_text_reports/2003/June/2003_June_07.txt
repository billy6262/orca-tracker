We received a message from someone who saw 3 adult and 1 juvenile orca on
May 31 or
June 1 near Coos Bay, actually going up Coos River, 3 miles inland, heading upstream!
*
And another call from Joe Schmitt, of 7 orcas - 1 male, 1 calf, and 5 gender unknown, off Whiskey Creek Beach (west of Pt. Angeles, across the strait from Sooke, BC), headed west, close in to shore in 25' of water. (sounds like it could've been Transients?)
