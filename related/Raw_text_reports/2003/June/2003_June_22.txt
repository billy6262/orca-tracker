Orca Sightings for June 22, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went to Point Roberts on U.S.- Canada border to see J and K Pods. They were really forageing and getting their fill. As I came through the rip at East Point I just had to stop and watch the action. The Sockeye run is definitely on and everything you can think of was in that rip. Eagles were diving for fish finning on the surface, Seals were everywhere, saw one Steller Sea Lion that must be lost or an old one that just hangs out these days, Sea birds everywhere. Js and Ks have been using Boundary pass lately when they come south and last night was probably no different. The early Sockeye use Rosario Strait for some reason to go to the Fraser so the Whales go down Rosario ( always southbound, as the fish are swimming toward them ) and now as the fish begin to use Haro and Boundary Pass to go north the Orcas come this way southbound. And for some reason for the past four years they go up Swanson Channel more when going north.
The L 12s went west and bet they come back with the rest of the Ls in the next day or so right on the heels of a salmon run. The rains of the past few days will make the salmon move toward the river and so does everything else. Pretty cool world we live in.

. Lots of breaching and K-20 (???) circled our boat 2 times very slowly before joining up with the rest of the group. Very active vocalizations.
