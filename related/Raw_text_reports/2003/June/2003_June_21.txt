The Orca Sing was wonderful, the sun came out and so did the whales. J and K pod showed up a bit early (

7:30 pm
), but none of us did mind. It was during the sound check that the whales decided to show up. Accompanied with Brazilian samba rithms, members of J and K displayed spyhops, breaches, and their own beautiful vocals.

Unidentified orcas, northbound at Kellet Bluff
10 p.m.
last evening (
June 21). Looked like a fairly large group. Possibly some southbound. Difficult to say from a kayak in lumpy seas past sunset. Probably part or all of the group from Limekiln earlier.
