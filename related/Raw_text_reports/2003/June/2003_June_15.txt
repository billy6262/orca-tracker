J pod as went north off the west side of San Juan Island. At about

5:00 p.m
. J pod came from the north and L and K pods came from the west and met up just south of Lime Kiln, close in to shore. J pod lined up in a greeting line, but the others didn't. The show was great-- many spyhops, tail slaps, tail lobs, breaches, and lots and lots of rolling around. Even one of the new calves got on its back and waved its pecs, just like the big guys. They were still socializing when we left after

9:00 p.m
.
