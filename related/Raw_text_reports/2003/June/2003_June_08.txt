We saw a pod of orcas both Saturday and Sunday,
June 7th and 8th while in Rosario Strait. They were seen around
9 or 10 am
. They were heading south (towards the Strait of Juan de Fuca). Several whales were breaching and jumping.

On Sunday the fabulous K-pod ladies were porpoising in a perfect, close formation abreast of each other, while the little calf surfaced to a rhythm of her own! (Still working on her buoyancy and breathing) At one point, two juveniles did an identical breach together. So beautiful.
