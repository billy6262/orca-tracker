A nice day on the water today with L-12's hangin' out on the west side of San Juan Island. A nice pass with L-79 Skana---he's sure starting to sprout!

The L12's and K's went north up the west side of the island this morning. The K's continued north. The L12's turned back south and spent the day off the west/south side. At around

5:00 p.m.
the orca magic began. The L12's passed south of Lime Kiln, then suddenly began travelling fast. At the same time reports were coming in that the J's and K's were travelling fairly rapidly down Henry Island. They met the L12's at the southern end of Mosquito Pass. Then the festivities began, with breaching, tail slapping, pec waving, spyhopping, and cartwheeling the norm. This activity kept up to a greater or lesser degree at least as far south as Edwards Point, with feeding going on as well. When a group orcas went kelping off Land Bank, several held salmon in their mouths kind of like toys -- although after a few dives, the salmon disappeared.
An interesting behavior I observed involved Mega (L41) and Ruffles (J1). Offshore of Edwards Point about 50 to 100 feet apart, each swam with two to three other orcas and appeared to be escorting at least one adult female. I left the orcas as they rounded Edwards Point at about

8:00 p.m.
