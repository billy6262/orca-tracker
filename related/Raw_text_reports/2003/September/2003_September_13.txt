J,K, and L Pod were once again enjoying the day off the West Side of San Juan Island near False Bay. Lots of activity too--we observed whales porpoising near the shoreline in groups of 3-5, while a majority of the whales were in no rush to move North. We could tell the whales were getting close as we observed all the fishing boats reeling in their lines, and soon we were surrounded by dozens of whales. L-41 came by, and we saw L-71 and L-57 close by as well. Superb vocalizations by all three pods (unless it was a very talented whale doing all three pods calls). A final group of 10 whales gracefully passed underwater the length of the boat and left us in awe at their beautiful passby. The whales were continuing on Northward past Edwards Point towards Lime Kiln.

A friend of mine just called to report (

3:20pm
) two orcas traveling into Pedder Bay, near Victoria. The boat was located at the mouth of Pedder Bay, approximately 1km off of Race Rocks. The orcas (I assume transients) were porpoising along. She gave no further description, therefore I am unsure as to whether or not they were male or female.
