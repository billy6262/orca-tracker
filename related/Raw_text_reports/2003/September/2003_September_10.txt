Orca Sightings for September 10, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We encountered the superpod offshore between False Bay and Eagle Point (west side San Juan Island). L79 "Skana" was swimming upside down under j8 "Speiden"????? J17 "Princes Angeline," J28 "Polaris," and J35 "Tahlequah" swam a circle around the "Odyssey." Besides incredible passes the vocalizations were out of this world.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report J & L pods milling off Hein Bank, San Juan Island at

10:15
this morning. He reported that J1 (stud!) and L53 were having a great time romantically.
