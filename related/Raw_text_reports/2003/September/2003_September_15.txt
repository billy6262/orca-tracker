I was on my way home from Seattle this morning on the

8:00 AM
Clipper and as we exited the fog just south of south Hein Bank I told my dad that I was going out back to have a quick spot. A bull surfaced about a half mile off of the port stern quarter... Fortunately, for my credibility, almost immediately upon my pointing the bull lunged out of the water which looked like the final slam on either a seal or porpoise. Two or three other orca surfaced after (females of juveniles).
