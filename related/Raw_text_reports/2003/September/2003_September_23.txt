Orca Sightings for September 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
My neighbor reported hearing something Sept 23 around the same time (

10:30 pm
). Said it woke her up, wasn't sure if it was a seal or not. We have had a lot of seal action this week in Saratoga Passage.

hmmm - guess I did hear something...the sounds I heard sounded more like whale blows, but were too faint to be sure, & it sounded like they were headed south down Saratoga....sb

Captain Jim found T-14, a BIG solitary Transient male, all the way down by Race Rocks and followed him back east on a flood tide. We were even able to observe T-14 take a seal!
