Orca Sightings for September 2, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
From about

10:30 a.m. to noon
a minke whale surface fed for more than an hour off Deadman's Bay off the west side of San Juan Island. It just kept circling. It would dive for about 4 minutes each time, then would surface with its mouth open and baleen dripping about 6 to 7 times before it would dive again. It did one spectacular lunge feeding before heading out more to the middle of Haro Strait. There were at least 4 bait balls in the small area around Deadman's Bay at the time. One was directly beneath me off the cliffs just south of Lime Kiln, for about twenty minutes. Seagulls and a small seal feasted on that one for awhile. Some of the birds were so full, they didn't even bother. Pretty interesting morning.
Later four L pod orcas came north to Land Bank about an hour after I last saw the minke, but they turned around and headed back south after about 5 minutes. The minke show was much better.

It seems as though the T41's must like the area around Race Rocks. My buddy who I was out with yesterday when we had the T41's go by us off of Sooke just called me to say that they went by him off of Bechey Head (East Sooke Park) inbound. They are probably going to give the pinnipeds at Race Rocks another scare. He called me at around

4:00
when he saw them entering Becher Bay.
