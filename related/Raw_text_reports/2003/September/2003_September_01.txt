Entry 1:
Orcas past Point Roberts (afternoon heading south). The False killer whale is also spending more time here.

We launched in Becher Bay and proceeded to Secretary Island off of Sooke Basin. Before we even got a line in the water I spotted 3 transients working east through the kelp beds. This was at approximately

1:00
. They were T 41, T41a, and T44. My understanding was that there were several transients further west outbound at this time as well as a couple of humpbacks a little south of us. I stayed with the T 41's until the sun went down in hopes of filming some great carnage. They never made it east of Race Rocks but spent a lot of time in Race Rocks as well as inside the gap between Bentick Island and Vancouver Island. All that I could tell that they successfully nabbed was a seal inside Bentick and one in Race Rocks reserve. I left them at

8:15
heading west in Whirl Bay.
