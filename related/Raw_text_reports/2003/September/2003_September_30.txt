Orca Sightings for September 30, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found the False Killer Whale, still off Lagoon Pt, West Whidbey Island at about

1:40 pm
. I videotaped it for 15 or 20 minutes, as it swam north, then south, then north, then in a circle, obviously feeding. I watched for another 45 minutes or so, and it seemed to move further out into the Strait and was heading in a southerly direction when I left it.

- We have one lone whale in front of our home at Lagoon Point. It continues to surface in about the same place Â½ mile West of Lagoon Point. I don't believe it is an Orca but do not know what it is. Small dorsal fin that curves toward the back.

I believe this whale is probably "Wilter" ("Wilma/Foster/Willy") Pseudorca or False Killer Whale.
