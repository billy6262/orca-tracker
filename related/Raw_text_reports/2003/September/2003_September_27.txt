5:20 pm
: Jim Maya called to report J,K & L pods 1 mile off the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, heading south. They left the Super Pod traveling south past the Whidbey Naval Air Station a bit before dusk, perhaps a mile off shore. They were all having a great time.

6:50 pm
: Ray Ditchfield called to report at least 6 orcas off West Beach, Whidbey Island, at Hastie Lake, close in, circling, and drifting south.
*

7:10 pm
: Rudy Deck called to report a pod of orcas off West Beach at Partridge Pt, Whidbey Island, heading south. And more from Rudy:
My wife counted about 25 orcas off of West Beach heading South at
7PM
Saturday. They were no more than a few hundred yards off of the bluff. Two other neighbors independently estimated 25 and 30.

I talked to Pat Kelly and confirmed the whale he'd seen in the Blair Waterway was the Pseudorca. He also saw it Sat. morning, Sept. 27, and reported an orca had also been seen in Seattle on Sept. 26, possibly the Pseudorca as well.
*
We saw what was probably the pseudo-orca from the Point Defiance Ferry at about

10:00 am
. Smallish fairly deeply curved fin, submerging and coming up again, blowing periodically. She or He was surrounded by small fishing boats at anchor.

My Friend Ana Garzon at Earthshare Washington sent along information regarding what I believe is a young Orca alone in the Blair Waterway in Tacoma, WA. The first sighting was on or around 9-17-03. The whale was "pacing" back and forth alongside the Oil Tanker Overseas Washington docked at the U.S.Oil terminal in Tacoma. I wanted to let you know that it was back this morning (Sept. 27) following a car ship.
