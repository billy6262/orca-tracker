Orca Sightings for September 6, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod decided to head North, so we went around Cattle Point where we heard K & L Pod were hanging out and slowly moving South. Sure enough, we had a nice encounter with K Pod just North of False Bay. Soon we saw some wet stuff that someone said was "rain" coming from the sky as we noticed some of L-Pod further out from shore. A few vocalizations on the hydrophone, and lots of vocalizations on the marine radio as everyone was helping each other out with the very spread out whales. Every time we would try to head around the whales and return to the dock, another group of whales would show up to see us! The whales seemed to take turns being the "active group" and we observed lots of splashing, breaches, tail slaps, and pec slaps. Cappucino came by the boat to show off his ever-growing dorsal fin. We left the well-mixed group of K's & L's still moving Southeast towards Cattle Point as the rains began to shower the parched islands! A wonderful day to add to a wonderful summer!
