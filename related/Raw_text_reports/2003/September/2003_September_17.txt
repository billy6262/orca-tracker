Orca Sightings for September 17, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call about a pod of 4 orcas about 6 miles offshore at Seiku, WA. The caller also reported that 1 Gray Whale had been hanging around the area lately.

I got a call from Tom (Sooke Coastal) at

9:30 AM
that there were 5 or 6 transients south of Sooke inbound. We were already on our way to a Superpod which were north bound approaching Battleship so I didn't get to see them until they were east of Race Rocks. T14 (Pender) was present and was travelling with a large bull (I identified him as T 162? but there is argument that he is an unknown) If this is T162, he has only been seen once on Vancouver Island as he is usually seen in southeastern Alaska (according to the 1999 Transients by John Ford and Graeme Ellis). I took some great id shots today and will get them back on Friday. I will pass anything on if he has not been positively id'd by then. There were also 4 others (looked like three females with a new calf) which were possibly part of the T46 group. I never got a really good look at these ones. They are presently (
5 pm
) just south of Discovery Island still heading in an easterly direction.

A report of 3 orcas off Snake Island near Nanaimo, heading north.

0900
- Lots of Orcas, likely Js and Ks, headed north past the County Park, northwest side, San Juan Is.
