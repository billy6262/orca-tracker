Susan, We also saw this
false killer whale
on Saturday, Sept. 20. It was near American Camp, where about 30 recreational fishing boats were that afternoon. It kept swimming around and around the inside circleof the boats. It was all black/dark gray with a small dorsal fin. We watched it for about Â½ hour before it swam away. It breached once, but I missed it, so I didnt see its head to determine which kind of whale it was.
