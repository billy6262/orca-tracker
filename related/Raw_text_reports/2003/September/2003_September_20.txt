Orca Sightings for September 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call on the hotline over the weekend that a lone whale was seen swimming off Eagle Pt. on Saturday Sept 20th. The caller described what could be a
False Killer Whale
or Pilot Whale. I have no other reports on this animal.

L pod off of East Point Light House on Saturna. L-5's were a bit shy of the main body, but they merged soon after. Lots and lots of activity.

We joined L Pod up East of Eastpoint heading towards Point Roberts. We observed more double/triple breaches and spyhops than we've seen in some time.
