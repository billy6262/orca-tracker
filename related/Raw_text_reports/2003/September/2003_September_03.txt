Orca Sightings for September 3, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a pod of whales (about 12) travel by here (Lopez Island) on Sept 3rd at about
3pm
. I was near an offshore island called Swirl Island in my kayak and a few of them came particularly close. One larger young male or large female surfaced within a paddle length beside my boat. She didn't just surface she stuck her head out of the water to look at me! Then she carefully dove below my boat, sideways so her dorsal fin would not hit my boat. No splash, no wake, it was incredibly gentle. She was with 3 smaller whales. Anyway, I am sorry to say that I did not have my wits about me to identify any individual or the pod. There was so much breaching and slapping going on I was just awe struck.

We saw what other people said were a couple of small humpback whales spouting off in the Strait about

6:45 PM
as we were coming back to Port Angeles on the Victoria Clipper. The captain kindly slowed the boat so we could all hang over the railing and gawk at them.

We joined a few boats over near False Bay (San Juan Island) to observe the L-12's, who were doing the random "West Side Shuffle" (heading one way, then the other). Slowly they moved towards Eagle Point, where there was ample evidence of salmon in the form of pinks (humpy) salmon every direction we looked. No L Pod vocalizations though. As we headed towards Cattle Point, we saw J-Pod in speed swimming mode coming rapidly across the entrance of San Juan Channel. We put the hydrophone in the water and we were greeted with a virtual symphony of J-Pod calls and echolocations! It was truly amazing to hear the volume and quantity of calls as they approached the L-12's. As we prepared to head back to port, Ruffles (J-1) decided to pay a quick visit and let everyone see up close why he's named the way he is.
