Orca Sightings for September 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was a day of whale romance...a day reminiscent of Barry White songs...well, let's just say that all three pods (J, K, & L) were feeling mighty frisky as they hung out off the West Side of San Juan Island. In the morning, the whales were close in near False Bay/Eagle Point. Later in the afternoon they moved out about 3-4 miles off the coast and got quite active. Tons of breaching, lots of male/female interactions, several "sea snakes" were in ample evidence, and even Ruffles showed us a thing or two! At first they were quiet and not many vocalizations were heard, but later they vocalized quite a bit as they moved back towards San Juan. On the way home we saw a feeding Minke whale off Cattle Point.
