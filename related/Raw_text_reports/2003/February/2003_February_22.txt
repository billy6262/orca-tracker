Orca Sightings for February 22, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had started out at
7.20am
at the Shellfish Lab and within 10 mins T-074, several females and offspring appeared exiting out of Quilcene Bay (122 degrees 51'W Long & 47 degrees 47' N Lat). A number of times a calf did a complete roll-over while still moving forward next to his mother... pretty neat! They all came through the center of the channel slowly heading southeast into Dabob Bay but were doing quite a lot of lunging, diving and even showing tail flukes. It appeared they were hunting but I didn't see seabirds hovering above so perhaps did not hunt successfully. I watched them for over 90 mins from several vantage points as they moved down the bay. At about Camp Harmony ( 122 degrees 51' W Long & 47 degrees 42' N Lat) they seemed to have made a kill as there was lots of splashing, twisting and turning and something was thrown in the air... but could not distinguish exactly what that was. This time seagulls were hovering above.
I also was able to count 32 harbor seals, heads out of the water at the same time, right at the waterline, while the orcas were out in the bay...I did not pick up the whales again until about
2.35pm
when I stopped in the Seal Rock area. I saw a female and calf way out in the bay to the southeast nearer to the Kitsap Peninsula (122 degrees 51' W Long & 47 degrees 40' N Lat). Then T-074 showed up much closer and gradually they moved slowly north, again making several eratic turns with long dives. We all gradually moved to the Pt. Whitney site and watched those three come in and head towards Quilcene Bay (122 degrees 51' W Long & 47 degrees 47' N Lat).

At the very stroke of
three
, we had Orca sightings again. They ARE sticking to their schedule. Looked like one male doing the wide radius circling, and a calf that seemed to be alone, or perhaps a calf and mom. (This is in Dabob Bay). Just then, one speedboat went by very fast, and another was following the whales staying right where they were coming to the surface (but with motor killed when they reached the Orca surfacing sites.) This seemed to immediately drive the whales away, for they stopped the circling/feeding/training activity of the past two days and submerged and took off.

7:15 PM
: Orcas passed fairly close to shore on western side of Dabob Bay. Heard four separate blows. Could have been that same group of 4 that the boats seemed to drive off at

3:00 PM
. The Orcas must have been traveling tonight, because they were soon out of hearing range, even though I sat for quite awhile. --
