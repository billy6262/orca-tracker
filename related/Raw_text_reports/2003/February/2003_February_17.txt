Orca Sightings for February 17, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dick Johnson of the Glen-Ayr Resort had seen 8 orcas moving north from just outside Hoodsport at
9.00 am
. Apparently both T-014 & T-074 were patrolling the east shoreline and the females and offspring were moving up the west shoreline.

8:30 am
. They were swimming near Hoodsport heading towards Lilliwaup (Spelling?). When they got near Lilliwaup they cut accross the other side of the canal. In the pod there were (That I saw): 1 Male, 2 or 3 females, and about 2 juveniles.
