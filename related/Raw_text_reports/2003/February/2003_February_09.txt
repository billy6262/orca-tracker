Both pods (but not together), from Triton Cove (122 degrees 59' longitude & between 47 degrees 36'-37' latitude). Both pods were heading north. We eventually got them sighted about
5.15pm
off Tabook Pt and Camp Harmony across on the east side of Dabob Bay (122 degrees 49' longitude & between 47 degrees 43'-46' latitude). One large male, (could not positively identify T-014 or T-074) and several females with two, possibly three, young.
Cheers
