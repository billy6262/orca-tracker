Orca Sightings for February 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:00-
3:20 PM
At least four separate Orca breachings close to large orange Navy beacon (floating ball) in the eastern, close to center, part of Dabob Bay. Get binoculars. Orca going in circles. At least one female and calf swimming and diving in synchrony. One fin appears larger than others, but cannot tell for sure because the Orca are surfacing very briefly, then diving, then surfacing, repeatedly. Amidst the Orca, a large number of BROWNISH creatures were headed, or attempting to head, north, cruising in and out of the water. The orca seem to be circling these brown creatures, sometimes with only the very tips of their dorsals showing. The brownish creatures do not look like harbor seals, which are dark-colored and way smaller. They look more like sea lions, which do occur here. The Orca are still circling, and a great to-do is going on among the gulls circling the area. Even the eagles are commenting from their perch. --

And Kirie also sent this:
confirmation of sea lion presence in Jackson Cove (adjoins Dabob Bay): We heard the Sea Lions barking here in [Jackson] Cove last week, hadn't heard about the Orcas being around until yesterday. I followed the King News truck over on the ferry yesterday afternoon. They did a broadcast from Pt. Whitney on the news last night and showed a seal-less Dosewallops spit. They said the Orcas could have eaten 800-900 seals while they were here. I was just helping Pete move the ladder and we saw a nice seal down by our deck. So, there is at least one left.

Hi Susan... sorry this is late but out of the area all day and late in last night. Feb 20 - Arrived at Pt. Whitney near to 4.50pm after driving down south and getting no information, sightings or reports of whales seen today. Apparently they had been up at Pt. Whitney putting on a show according to some reports! Russell Rogers, Fish & wildlife Biologist at the Shellfish Lab told me he had observed, what he believed, was the whole group, just hanging around the Eastern Dabob Bay opposite the Lab, swimming slowly south. Then some females, juveniles and calves were playing "keep away" with a fish, a salmon, throwing it in the air! They did this for some time and seemed to have the youngsters in a "training session". Where was I with the camera for that one? I did get to see them about 5.00pm further south and there appeared to be one male, couple of females and offspring. (122 degrees 50' W Long and 47 degrees 44' N Lat) Though too far to I.D. which male, they were doing plenty of lunging and quick turns and a few seagulls were following along. Presume that was part of a serious hunt! Unfortunately it was dusk and the tide coming in so my view was limited. Better luck next time.... Cheers... Judy Dicksion

As I have the front row seat here, a half mile or so from the tip of Pulali Pt, friends have been calling to ask/tell me about Orca sightings. So about two hours after the big feeding frenzy I saw from 3-
3:30, here's another sighting, heading south: >>Kirie, You got us all excited and Pete just happened to look out (just after we saw a big sea lion off our deck at about
5:30), and there they were, three similar-sized Orcas, kind of frolicking, then they submerged, didn't see them come up. They weren't in the [Jackson Bay] Cove. They were out about halfway between Pulali and Dose, heading south.
I have noticed that I only see the Orcas if I look for them. Seems obvious, but you can live on the water and not look out expecting to see Orcas, or nuclear submarines, you know? The only way I figured out the first time they were here was from hearing the blows at night and recognizing them from my childhood. So now I'm going out to my little "whale watch" seat on the cliff about every hour of the day, on into night. --

Last night 2.20.03, after the "Orca hunt" moved south from my place, my parents, one half mile further south, say possibly nine (9) Orcas remained in their cove up until dark. One large one (male?) and several mother/calf pairs. --
