Orca Sightings for February 14, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...both T-14 and T-74, plus possibly 2 females and 2 babies and a juvenile entered Quilcene Bay around
10.30am -11.00am
. I got there after 11.15am. Since several of us at Pt. Whitney boat launch could not see them for some time it was thought they had moved around the west side of the Bolton Peninsula and were in the east side of Quilcene Bay possibly hunting. I hear the seals are pretty plentiful in that area! (122 degrees 51' west longitude and 47degrees 47' north latitude). T-74 did move around the bay to the west side then went back to the east around noon. Around
1.44pm
we saw the group coming out of the bay hugging the south end of the peninsula. There was no sign of T-14 but T-74, probably T-73 and perhaps two or three of her offspring as well as another female and calf. They were definitely "on a mission", porpoising fast and close together. T-74 and one baby were very close and it was hard to know exactly how many (estimated 6, possibly 7) because of the speed, closeness and no identifiable separate blows due to wind. They headed straight across the entrance to the Dabob inlet to the east side of Dabob Bay and then moved south near Zelatched Point and out of sight.
Cheers...
