Orca Sightings for February 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research this afternoon, reporting that J pod swam past the Center (west side of San Juan Island) at about 1300 this afternoon, heading south. He said they were spread out and foraging, with lots of calls and echolocation being picked up on the hydrophone.
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research later reported that J pod was passing Whale Watch Park at 1406, still heading south.
