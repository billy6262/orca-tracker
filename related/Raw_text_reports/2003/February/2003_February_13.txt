I found what appears to be J pod off Lagoon Pt (west Whidbey Island), heading north at

1:30 pm
. They were very spread out, doing some milling & fishing, some lob-tailing & breaching. Saw one male, presumably J1, way on the other side. I left them a little before 2, still heading north & passing Ft. Flagler. Also saw some Dall's porpoise earlier in the day heading south down Saratoga Passage, and yesterday there were Dall's in Saratoga with J pod, heading south.

Around
10.30 AM
, one or two groups of transients entered Dabob Bay, traveling quickly, headed north. I thought I could see six from my house. I ran north up the paths and ran into some workers at the little Navy lookout, and they said they earlier saw big guy, two females, and possibly two calves, also headed north. The six I saw looked all the same size and were swimming parallel to each other.

And Judy Dicksion of Bremerton called with this report: At

10:30 am
, the Transients were on the east side of Dabob Bay, near Pt. Whitney Shellfish Lab. She saw T74, with several juveniles & females. It looked like they made a kill, then went north into the north end of Dabob Bay, coming out around

12:30 pm
. She left them near Camp Harmony, traveling south.

Susan,
We live on the water, in Seabeck between Hood Pt. and Fisherman's Cove. ... two smaller whales, not babies but not the big males. This was at about

5:20 p.m
. They were off Fisherman's Cove heading North. ... At

5:50p.m
. I heard whales behind me. I turned around and there were three medium sized whales moving slowly North about 35 feet off the shoreline. They were about 200 yards South of Hood Point, about 15 yards South of where I stood.

Hi Susan, its Barbara from Shadowfax and I wanted to tell you a huge pod just headed north past Bush Point! Big group, it was spread out all over about a mile, playing, diving and hopping, tail splashing and the works! They ought to be at about lagoon point now, at
10 min to 1pm
. Seemed like lots, maybe more than 20? 25? Big ones, middle sized ones and small ones!
