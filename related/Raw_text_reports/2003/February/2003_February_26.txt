Orca Sightings for February 26, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
...approx
3pm
arrived at Pt. Whitney. Apparently one male and perhaps 3 females with 3 offspring had passed very close to shore about 15-30 mins prior to my arrival. ...the whales were over on the east side of the bay out of sight for about an hour (122 degrees 51' W Long & 47 degrees 48' N Lat). Then we started seeing the male just cruising around at the north end and gradually some females and youngsters started moving into action also. Quite a lot of splashing, tail slaps, I believe some breaching and definitely the eratic movements of a serious hunt for "dinner". There were some seabirds on the water that kept getting scattered but stayed around above and then diving, apparently able to find "left-overs"
6.00pm to 6.15pm
...listening to the male (I am sure by the sound) who seemed to be moving back and forth in front of the Bolton Peninsula. He seemed to be alone and eventually sounded like he finally moved to the Dabob Inlet side of the Peninsula (122 degrees 50' W Long & 47 degrees 47' N Lat).

We received a message from Marilyn Dahlheim of NMML, who was out with the Hood Canal Transients yesterday to see how they're doing and to take some photos. She said they found all 11 orcas, and that they looked really healthy. They were with them from
noon - 5
on Feb. 25, and observed 1 seal kill. They followed them from the Hamma Hamma area north to Dabob Bay. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research was out with them as well yesterday.

At

2:30 PM
today, the Orca seemed to be engaged in a hunt close to the western shore. They were very spread out in a long line about a quarter mile long, then went under and re-appeared way far out in a tiny tight group of nine. One of the nine was the male, and the rest were a combination of females and babies. When they were close to shore, one of the Orcas spy-hopped, the first time I've seen that during this 7 weeks of whale watching outside my window. --
