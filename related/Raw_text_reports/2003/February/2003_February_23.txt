Orca Sightings for February 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I first saw some gulls flying and diving in one area on the east side of Dabob Inlet about
8.08am
(122 degrees 48' W Long & 47 degrees 48' N Lat). I later only saw, I believe, T-074, then a female and calf. They worked their way slowly down the east side of Dabob Bay and appeared to again be on the hunt.: quick turns, some splashing, tail slaps etc. and they were diving more steeply after each blow. I managed to keep track of the trio as they moved to the south end of Dabob Bay (no further evidence of a successful hunt like before) and into the center of the channel (122 degrees 51' W Long & 47 degrees 40' N Lat). I received a call from Carol Johnson at Glen-Ayr Resort, just north of Hoodsport (123 degrees 8' W Long & 47 degrees 25' N Lat), who said a male, female and calf were just going north along the near shore (west side of the canal) about
2.15pm
after spending about an hour or so down south of them.

Hi,Susan.
I live on the west side of Hood Canal, directly across from Bald Point, on the Great Bend. At
2am
this morning (2/23), ...I could HEAR. It sounded like a whale party... blow after blow... directly below our lawn (we live about 200 feet above). There was splashing, too, and a couple quite distinct plopping noises (??).

Hello!
I saw Orca Whales today(2/23)! Saw one large male and 3-4 smaller whales just South of Hamma Hamma river on the Hood Canal. They were swimming North pretty steadily. He would come up to breathe 3-5 times and then dive, reappearing farther North. He was to the west of the center of the canal but too far out for photos. The smaller whales were ahead of him and more towards the east. I watched them from about
3 pm
to about

3:30 pm
.
