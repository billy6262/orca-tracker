At

4:15 pm
there are Orcas traveling fairly rapidly southward past Possession Point Park. Theyre nearer the west side of Possession Sound. Hard to count, maybe 7, but at least one large male and at least one calf.

Hi Susan!
I finally got some video footage of Orcas in the canal! Today, about

3:30pm
, about a quarter mile south of the Hamma Hamma River, heading north.

First spotted T-14 at Hoodsport area opposite Glen-Air Resorts.at
2.07 pm
. He seemed alone at first but then two young calves rose right next to each other and looked like they were playing tag. They stayed together it seemed for almost the next hour and looked very cute! All were moving north so I drove up and stopped south of Lilliwaup several times.
2.17 pm
saw T-74 and a female moving north fairly slowly.
2.26 pm
T-14 was ahead and the two babies were following then I sighted T-74 and a female again. They were moving nearer to the east side then seemed to be using a zig-zag pattern to cover the width of the channel.... maybe hunting? I did not see any seagulls around them so didn't think they were feeding but one whale watcher said he saw one seagull pick up something around one of the males earlier and then flew off. Further up the canal near Eagle Creek (west side) at
2.39pm
I saw the babies again (presume the same ones as still rolling around each other) but nearer the east side with a female nearby and then T-74. Maybe it was T-73 and her young in close vicinity. I wondered if the adults were hunting and the babies were purposely left to the rear. I do wish I knew more about the behavior patterns and what to look for specifically! I was not able to see good enough for a nick in one of the babies' fins for identification. Near Jorsted Creek, south of Eldon, I watched for them coming north and saw distinctly five blows, all split seconds after each other, and later at
2.46 pm
saw my last view of T-74, two females together and two small ones. I believe T-14 had gone on ahead with perhaps a female and maybe others including young. Cheers....

Just received a call from Nancy Nolan, who lives on Saratoga Passage near Baby Island (SE side of Whidbey Island) She saw 2 orcas (there could have been more?) heading south toward Langley at

11:40 am
. She said they were active and breaching - I hope some of you on South Whidbey get to see them too! I'm heading out with our scope and binocs to see if I can catch up with them!

WOW! What a day for whales off Whidbey! At
1pm
I found the pod that was reported earlier, just entering Langley (Saratoga Passage, east whidbey island). They were very spread out between Camano Island and Whidbey, but several were very close. I thought I saw 2 males, but the whales became so spread out that I lost sight of one of them. They were doing some lob-tailing and splashing, and were still heading south. At

1:30
some were near Camano Head, others near Sandy Pt, and some were real close in, between the Langley marina & Sandy Pt. Off Sandy Pt. and around Hat/Gedney Island, they seemed to be milling and feeding, changing directions but still generally heading south. At.
2:30, there were whales north & south of Hat/Gedney Island, and a small group of Dall's Porpoise further out. At
3:15 the whales were AT the Clinton ferry dock - 2 were so close in they were right off the pilings for the dock, totally oblivious to the ferry that was landing, and the jackhammers and other construction noise taking place during dock rebuilding! At

3:45
the pod came by Glendale, really close in where I could see them well, and I was able to positively ID J1 (Ruffles, the male with the ruffled fin). I saw a mom/calf pair, and counted between 12 - 15 whales total, swimming in several tight groups, and moving faster. I could not find the other male I thought I'd seen earlier (but there is a report below of a pod that passed this same area 3 hours earlier....so it sounds like there were several pods out there somewhere!). I watched them continue south past Possession Pt. between

4:30 & 5
, and left them still heading south off into the sunset.....what a glorious day for whale watching! And many thanks for all the following reports that were sent in as well, and to Nancy Nolan for her call this morning to tip me off that the whales were here!

Hi Susan,
I just saw your note about southbound Orcas near Langley, so looked out the window and there they were! I just saw them briefly, about

12:35 p.m
., traveling south, fast, out from Columbia Beach, perhaps about 4 of them. No theatrics, just a head above water here and there. I got only a brief glimpse before they disappeared. Then a ferry crossed their path, but I saw them once again when they were nearing Glendale - only 3-4 minutes later. What a treat!

NOTE: This is a different pod from the one reported earlier, as they didn't reach Langley until 1 pm -

Four or five orcas passed by the ferry dock at Clinton. Two were quite close to the ferry dock and two were about a third of the way out in the passage. They were slowly moving South.

At

3:20
one fin lazed along columbia beach unti a motor boat zoomed out to follow. 4 minutes later two smaller fins lazed along. 3 minutes later another fin appeared. definitely 4 heading south.

Hi Susan,
At

3:25
a phone call came saying "orcas off Columbia Beach headed south", and sure enough there they were again - different ones, I presume, from the last group at

12:30
. These were taking the same course south as the others. I saw a pair, then another pair, then a single one. Either there was more than one single, or he/she was hanging about in one general area for awhile. Both of the pairs, however, disappeared from my limited view quickly with apparent motivation to get somewhere. That makes at least 9 that I saw today, assuming the two groups were not composed of the same animals.
