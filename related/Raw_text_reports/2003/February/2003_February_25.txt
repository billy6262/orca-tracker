Orca Sightings for February 25, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan
I got the info of the
9.15 am
sightings... I picked up T-74 alone cruising the far shore south of Eldon (east side of the canal) (123 deg 01 W Long & 47 deg 32' N Lat)... Moving down towards Lilliwaup ... one male, T-74 had already come by and some females and offspring were within sight but closer to the west side (123 deg 02' W Long & 47 deg 31 ' N Lat) ... We spotted several females and offspring, probably 5/6 whales in all, as T-74 had joined them around
11.20 am
just east of the center of the canal south of Holly on the Kitsap Peninsula (123 deg W Long & 47 deg 33' N Lat). 2 Females and T-74 seemed to be on a hunt towards the east side of the canal... At
11.44am
they broke off and were porpoising north moving quite fast. About
noon
two females with two young, who were a short distance behind, quickly changed course and headed into a cove just south of Holly (122 deg 59' W Long & 47 deg 33 ' N Lat).

Hi Susan
A odd day re transients, we decided to go into Haro rather then Race Rocks. Around Kelp Reef we found a few Dall's and decided to push on towards Kellet Bluff were we found a number of Dall's. We started to return to Vic. when we met 1 transient, called in Jim Maya who reported at least 3 whales and Dave and Candi had the same. Returned to find a 4th transient T61 going into Oak Bay left that one to check on Dave's transients, found all 3 of Discovery Island. At this point I agree with Dave's Id. As S.E. Alaskans.

Susan,
At the stroke of
four
, I heard breathing. Finally, I saw the Orcas. They were traveling fairly rapidly north into Quilcene Bay at that point. They were going in and out of the water so quickly, it was difficult to count them. But there were no big males. It looked like four females, maybe calves, but again, they moved too quickly for me to do anything but note the breathing and head, then spray.

Just received a call from Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research, relaying a report of orcas in front of Salty's at Alki in Seattle at around
9 am
this morning.

Candi and I just got back from a transient encounter. Around
1350
, we got a call from Jim Maya saying he was with whales heading north near Kelp Reef in Haro Strait. When we got there we found three whales- a female, a bull, and a sprouter. I am all but positive that these three were T94 (AH2), T93 (AH1), and T97 (AH5), respectively. I'll let you know if our pictures tell us they are someone else. These transients are seen most often in Southeast Alaska although they have made it down this way before. The AH numbers are their old Alaska numbers. There was another bull about a mile west of these whales deeper in Cordova Bay. All the whales turned and backtracked south and out with the single bull (who turned out to be T61 (V1)) checking out the Chain Islets and the north side of Trial Is before heading west (?). Ron and Mark were on Mallardand were with him last and would know where they left him. T93, T94, and T97 went south of Seabird Point on Discovery Island and we left them about 2-3 miles south of Trial Island heading west at
1825
. We did not observe any kills while we were with them-even though there were porpoises everywhere!
