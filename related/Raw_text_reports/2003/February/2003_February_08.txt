At

10:30 am
this morning I spotted 3 of the T-pod at Dewatto Bay. It was 2 calves and T-14. Going South. Then at

13:00 (
1:00 pm)
I spotted through my binoculars about 3-4 at approx. Hoodsport heading north (I am about 10 miles from there). As they got closer to my location I seen that there was 8. Just a little past Dewatto Bay still heading north in a straight line. T-14 was in the middle of the pod. As they approached the mouth of Dewatto Bay they split. 4 (2 calves, what looked to be a female then T-14) just to the east of them approx. 50 foot or so 2 more and behind them just about in the middle of the 2 groups was 2 more. As I continued to watch the 2 on the farthest east side continued north, the 4 in the middle reversed heading south and the 2 that were in the middle lagging back headed west. This went on for about 5 minutes and they all regrouped in the original formation and continued south of 4-2-2. There was no spouting just a normal pace of surfacing.

Today's update was T14 and his group all 7 of them come back to the south end and T 14 had shown some great action this morning about
11 am
they arrived and T14 jumped way out of the waters. Then they tried for the first time go father down to the east side of the canal - they have never done that in the past just to the elbow then back up in the afternoon about

3:30 pm
.

Susan-made it out on Saturday and ran into both T14 with 2 females and T74 with 7 or 8 others heading south near Lilliwaup. We left the T14 group near Ayock still heading south and never saw that group again. The T74 group with two calves headed into the shallow flats at the Skokomish R in 15'-20' of water, the along the dropoff edge to the east, ending up on the corner flats near Union. Put on quite a show chasing something we never saw. Got good photos most all including the two calves which we believe are the only small whales in the Canal. In general, they travelled without a lot of boat attention although when they got to the south end, lots of crabbers got interested. Believe WDFW Enforcement will be watching if any blatant harassment goes on.
