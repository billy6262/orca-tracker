Orca Sightings for February 19, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported that J pod was still off the west side of San Juan Island yesterday (Feb. 19), as of

2:30pm
., traveling south through Haro Strait. And it appears there is a new calf with J pod! After several earlier sightings by Tom McMillen, and Center for Whale Research staff (& I even got a pretty good look at it when J pod was off South Whidbey), and having a good day with J pod this week, Ken was able to get photo-documentation of the new calf, and will soon confirm who it belongs to. This is great news for the Southern Residents - let's all hope it's a strong and healthy little orca.

We received a call from Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures, who reports that his brother, a Ranger at Deception Pass State Park (n. Whidbey & FIdalgo Islands) had a report of a pod of approx. 15 orcas off Deception Island.

Candi Emmons & Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research report that J pod went past the Center (west side of San Juan Island) again this morning, 2-19, at

10:15
, spread out, with some breaching. They were with J pod yesterday (Feb. 18) from Cattle Pass up into San Juan Channel and past Friday Harbor. They left J pod yesterday evening (2/18) east of Flattop Island (NE of San Juan Isl) very spread out and heading in a northerly direction. We had another report of a pod of orcas yesterday (2-18) from Tom McMillen, who saw them from the Anacortes/Friday Harbor ferry in Rosario Strait at
2 pm
. He thought they were headed south, but wasn't sure.
*
We received a call from Jim, at Glen Ayr Resort in Hoodsport, of ~6 orcas traveling north at approx.

2:30 pm
. 1 large and 4 or 5 smaller whales.
*
And another call from Jim Connelly of Ayok Pt, Hood Canal (just north of Lilliwaup), reporting a pod of orcas milling around near Jorsted Creek at approx.

4:30
. He saw one male, and at least 2 females, and said they appeared to slowly be moving north.

Hi Susan! ...Orcas heading north up the canal. At

4:30PM
they were rounding Ayock Beach. Not much out of the water activity, so limited visibility, but saw one or two adults and several young. I knew they were out as the King5 News helicopter was hovering over my house!
Is there any confirmation yet on sightings of these same (canal) transients outside of the canal since their arrival?? I'm still wondering if they are moving freely through the Hood Canal Bridge, or at least past any Naval sonar. It's been brought up that the sonar can disorient them. Any new news on this??
Thanks!

I've not heard of any sightings of them outside the canal since they were first reported on Jan. 3rd, & we've had sightings of them almost daily in the canal since then - sb
