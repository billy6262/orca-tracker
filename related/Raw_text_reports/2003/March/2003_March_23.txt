Orca Sightings for March 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw 3 Grays on
March 23 on the

12:00pm
ferry run from Mukilteo to Clinton. I saw the first in Possession Sound at approximately 47 58.345 N and 122 19.413W at

12:15pm
. It was small, perhaps a calf. I saw the blow, then its tail as it dove. It was heading in a northerly direction.
The next sighting was a few minutes later. I saw two Grays swimming together just east of the Clinton ferry landing at approximately 47 58.504 N and 122 20 720 W. I saw them blow a couple of times and then saw their tails as they dove. They also seemed to be small -- about the same size as the first one.

Hi Susan -
We were at our cabin this weekend (
March 22 & 23) and saw a single grey apparently feeding close to shore mid afternoon. We are just south of Harrington's Lagoon (SE of Coupeville on Penn Cove). Exact same location and behavior as we witnessed last year. A couple of hours of blowing and circling within a couple hundred yard area - right in front of the cabin!

Hi again,
We were wrong. There's at least 3 gray whales off of possession point (it's

3:10
now), and most likely 4.

This morning at

7:10 AM
here on Bells beach, we are watching 2 boats off of Fox Spit as they are whale watching 2 Grays. Pretty far, so can't tell exactly if they are feeding, playing, or what direction they are heading.

Well now its
8:50 and the 2 grays have just passed Bells Beach, mid passage, and are heading south toward Langley. Big dudes!

Good morning. I live next to the Inn at Langley, and there has been a gray whale feeding off and on very near shore here all morning. I first saw it around
7 am
, and again it just came by at

9:30 am
, making its leisurely way to the south. This was my first whale sighting ever, so quite an experience!

Gray feeding in front of us here @ Bells Beach for about 20 to 30 min. Heading toward Langley. The markings look familiar after 3 years of watching from here...but hard to describe. There is a fluke/fin? up front that has white wavy stripes and he has a white round spot on his/her back on his left side, near the spine..larger than a barnacle, maybe as big as my hand...hard to tell from the cliff!
