Orca Sightings for March 13, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
Nancy Black (California Orca Researcher) just emailed me a photo taken by a passenger on a whalewatch boat in Monterey Bay on the 13th of March. It clearly shows a shot of L71 among a reported thirty or so whales heading southwest. They made it down there again!

This is an astounding report from the Center for Whale Research - for the second known time in history, members of L pod (and maybe???) have once again been recorded in Monterey Bay, California taking a Spring Break! A photo confirms the presence of male L71, with a pod of ~30+ whales.
On
January 29, 2000, 33 members of L pod (including L71) and 12 members of K pod were photographed and identified in Monterey Bay for the first time, representing the furthest travel record of Southern Resident Orcas in the history of the Center For Whale Research's study.
It is not known whether this is a typical travel pattern for them, and they just had never been seen or photographed in the past; or whether this is a new thing for them. The winter travels of the Southern Resident Community have remained one of the mysteries of this population, and reports such as these provide important information for researchers trying to help this orca population.
We received a report of a pod of orcas, reported as Transients, off Pt. Reyes (CA) on
March 8th - we'll see if we can obtain any additional information or photos in case they were actually some of our Southern Residents on their way south....stay tuned for more info. on this exciting news!
Here's the report from the Center for Whale Research, along with more gray whale reports:
