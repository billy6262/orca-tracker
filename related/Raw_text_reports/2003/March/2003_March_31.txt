Orca Sightings for March 31, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We live on Saratoga Passage down from the Inn at Langley just inside the Langley city limits. Went to let my puppy out this morning just after
8 AM
and heard that wonderful whoosh. Two greys, not sure if they were mother and calf, were feeding no more than 50 yards from our deck. We had the best view ever of the flukes. They were heading up to Langley. Hope they stay around for a while this year.

Hi, Susan,
A single, large gray whale was travelling swiftly east toward Sandy Point in shallow water at

9:30
this morning.

A caller left a message that from

12:50 to
1:00 PM
he had seen a gray whale about 1/4 to 1/2 mile south of Polnell Point (NE Whidbey Island, near Oak Harbor), heading south.
