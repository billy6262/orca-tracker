Orca Sightings for March 3, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call tonight from Judy Dicksion of Bremerton, who heard from Chris Dunagan that the Transients had passed Bangor, and that people on the Hood Canal bridge said they believe they observed 7 - 9 orcas going north through the bridge and out of Hood Canal
around noon
today.

I can see three Orcas in Possession Sound, just north of Possession Park, in the center of the channel. There is one adult and two juveniles. They're spending a lot of time on long dives, heading slowly northward. It's

5:34 pm
