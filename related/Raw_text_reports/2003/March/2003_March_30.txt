Entry 1:
At

Tom McMillen reported at least four grays apparently feeding just off Possession Point, at the south tip of Whidbey Island. They cruised back and forth in water in about 70 feet deep for almost an hour.

Hello all:
My son and I have been here on Bells Beach listening to gray blows from about

7:45 PM -
8:30 PM
. For the most part, single blows about every 15 to 25 seconds, so thought that it might be one gray but a couple of times hearing blows about 3-4 seconds a part, so thought it might be a couple. Not sure but we are sure its eating time for the length of time it or they have been out front. Not sure of direction as they are left to right and right to left for 45 minutes.

I was awakened at

3:30 this morning
by loud splashing and breathing right outside my back door, next to the Inn at Langley. I couldnt see them, but there seemed to be two and perhaps three whales feeding about 50 yards off shore. They kept at it until at least

4:45 am
. Wow! What a magical way to wake up!
