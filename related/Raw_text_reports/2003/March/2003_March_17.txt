Hi, Susan,
...

8:20
this morning. A large and a small gray are feeding just west of Sandy Point - further out than usual, maybe 100 yards off the beach. Huge fins, turning and tumbling - hundreds of shorebirds gathered to nibble up any extras unearthed by the huge whale. Now the big one is moving West and North further out into the channel, blowing and showing its full back, moving deeper, then shallower to feed; the little one is difficult to see, except that its plume is small. There was another whale further east at the same time I spotted the other two - it was sporadically feeding, then appeared to head around Sandy Point.
