Susan,
I was on the beach at west end of Langley at around
8:15 am and saw a grey whale spouting a bit further east, and heading that way. I also saw one from
6:30 am Clinton ferry yesterday (

I stopped by the lookout near Lake Hancock (west Whidbey Island, just north of Greenbank), and got to see a pod of orcas traveling north, closer to the other side near Fort Flagler. I watched from

5:45 - 6 pm
, but counted approx. 8 whales, very spread out but traveling at a good pace.

Brad Hanson of NMFS called in to report a pod of orcas from the Kingston Ferry at
