About
11.03am
... T-74 to the east, north of Camp Harmony on the Toandos Peninsula (122 deg 49' W Long & 47 deg 45' N Lat). He appeared to be foraging along the shoreline on his own but about
11.27am
we definitely saw two large females, and maybe 1 juvenile and calf, who had joined him in the hunt... About
1.14pm
the action started as the whales came out of the inlet. A female and juvenile started some serious huntinging in front of the Bolton Peninsula (122 deg 50' W Long & 47 deg 47' N Lat)... with much twisting and lunging. T-14 got into action ... At
1.26pm
a juvenile close by arched and went into a deep dive it seemed and then T-14 and the 2 females were hunting seriously. About
1.40pm
all five orcas rose and started quickly transiting the area to the south. At
2.28pm
I saw with alarm that two females and two calves were going to pass right through the middle of about 6 - 8 boats.
