Orca Sightings for March 22, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:15 a.m.
We've been enjoying watching two gray whales feed for the past 15 minutes. I think they are headed north toward Bell's Beach. I lost them when I came in to fill my coffee cup. We're about 3 miles north of Langley on Saratoga Passage.
