Orca Sightings for March 2, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
... just South of the Hamma Hamma River at about

1:00
, and I saw one male surface farther north. ... It didn't take long before we saw a female and the calf. They were swimming fast and steady south.

hi susan
I did find the Transients about
1430
near the Hamma Hamma River heading north - by that point one boat was with them and a few cars on side of road - - I stayed with them until about
1630
when they were off the Duckabush River - surprised they had been hard to find - sighting conditions were ideal - overcast and calm - didnt see any obvious predation events but there were numerous nervous harbor seals
Thanks

...there was one report a family from Poulsbo had of the whales being sighted at the end of Dabob Rd..... that is on the east side of Dabob Inlet on Tarboo Bay (122 deg 49' W Long & 47 deg 50' N Lat). ...a friend in Dabob Inlet who said that he had seen three orcas leave the area, moving south, around
9.00am
but no sightings since that time. He also said the neighbors told him the whales had spent the night just north of Broad Spit (122 deg 49' W Long & 47 deg 49' N Lat).

Hi,
... saw a large male orca with what looked like a v-shaped notch in the back side of its dorsal fin (sounds like T74)... Approximate position: 47 36.225N and 122 56.787W. It was East of Triton Head swimming down the middle of the Canal.
Also, there was quite a bit of orca activity just offshore from Nelita at approximately 47 35.411N and 122 57.119W. I saw at least 2 females (possibly more) and at least 4 babies or juveniles (don't know the proper term). It was hard to tell exactly how many because they were milling around in the bay.
I spotted the same group again right off the beach at Ayock Pt. at

2:15 pm
