A call from Moclips, WA (from a boat off the coast) today - Larry Sevick reported a pod of a dozen orcas traveling northward at
3 pm
. We are hoping it's L pod on the way home from Monterey!
And another orca report, from the west side of Whidbey:

I just returned from Homes Harbor -- prowled up the south side and checked out an overview from the Freeland dock -- I couldn't see any sign of orcas in distress -- of course it's a big harbor, but I think I'd have seen something. I saw one splash off Beverly Beach, but I suspect that was a seal -- no blows and no fins that I could see (difficult to find a viewpoint because of all the private property).

Hi, Susan,
Two large grays rounded Sandy Point (SE of Langley, east Whidbey) at

5:00 PM
, heading east, then south between Whidbey and Hat Islands, mid-channel. One looked slightly larger than the second, and was taking the lead. Nice fluke views, deep dives, travelling swiftly S by SE.

Orca Sighting in Oak Bay, BC:
My sister Ann reports a sighting this morning around

8:30am
off of Harling Point on the southeast tip of Vancouver Island (between Gonzales Bay and McNeil Bay). They came up right in front of her while she was doing her morning ritual of touching the water.
Three were spotted just immediately off of the shore, within 15' of where she stood on of the rocky shoreline. The rocks drop off very quickly there. It is a popular spot for sealions, perhaps because of the sudden depth. One large (not overly), one medium size and one small (a calf?), they moved slowly in a westerly direction.
The large one had a notch near the top of its 3' (approx.) dorsal fin. The mid-sized one had a ghosty white saddle at the base of its dorsal fin. The small one wasn't distinctively marked. She thinks they were feeding, moving slowly westwards. She followed them to the extent possible as they gained speed traversing the entrance of Gonzales Bay.
