Orca Sightings for November 13, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I don't know how many there were, they were spread out over a large area. I'd say at least 20 or 30 Orcas. I saw them at the South end of Whidbey Island, around the Possession Buoy, Scatchet Head Buoy, and from Cultus Bay to a couple miles south. I was in my 12' boat, so I didn't want to travel too far.
It was between

1:00 pm and
3:00 pm
when we were out taking pictures of the whales. A friend had called me between
12:30 and
1:00 to tell me that there were Orcas just feet from our channel entrance buoys to Sandy Hook (Cultus Bay).
The whales were surfacing and spouting, and moving slowly. We saw a couple breach completely out of water. Saw some tail slapping and a couple roll on their sides. Don't know if they were feeding - though I heard the chum salmon are probably running through the area. They looked playful.
A male orca had some definite markings on his dorsal fin, it was really wavy.

My wife just called (

7:30 am
) to let me know that she is watching the whales now. They are just off of possession pt. (S. Whidbey Island). She reported about 7 - 9 whales, heading south towards kingston, pretty spread out. She did see a spy hop too.

Ken Balcomb received a report from a fisherman that the orcas were between Double Bluff & Possession Pt, west Whidbey Island at

11:30 am
(no direction of travel was given).

Charles & Mary Pacher called at

12:20 pm
to report a gray whale in Saratoga Passage, about 3 miles north of Greenbank, heading south.

Orcas off south Whidbey at about
2 pm
, just as they were headed south out of Possession Sound and coming around Possession Pt. Ken Balcomb was over by Point No Point, where he had been able to hear J's & K's with his hydrophone, but hadn't yet been able to see them. I steered him toward the whales as they headed south west, and he was able to confirm that we had J & K pods. I watched until about

3:30 pm
, they seemed to be doing a fair amount of fishing, some back & forth movement going on, tail lobbing, a breach or two, as they slowly made their way south-westward.

Mum and calf humpback 4-5 miles due south of Victoria at
1330
. At
1100
"Mallard" and Rhonda were again hiking at Beechey Head when Rhonda was sure she had a male and at least one other Orca about 4 miles south west going east. A Prince of Whales zodiac was notified and found them at about
1330
south of Race Rocks. Mallard went out at
1400
and confirmed 5-6 transients, no male but a very young calf only a few months old, he left them at the VG buoy east of Race Rocks going east just after
1500
.
He went to find the humpbacks I mentioned earlier and 2 others (humpbacks) that Jeff LaMarsh of "Seafun" reported at
1420
from Beechey Head.
Now radio reports from a few fishermen are talking about transient off Victoria. 1 male 3 others going east off Beacon Hill park at
1630
so not the best light. The male had a clean dorsal but 1 female a nick half way down the back edge. At first glance maybe the T7's, hopefully the photos will tell.
