Orca Sightings for November 3, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw what I thought might have been a sea lion surface less than 100 yards off shore by the Mukilteo Light house Park beach Monday (just to the south around the point from the ferry dock) about

5:00pm
+/-. I waited to see if it would resurface but didn't see any more activity. I didn't see any flukes or blowing.

The whales out front (west side of San Juan Island) this morning (
9am
) were J,.K, and L pods spread out and foraging. Lots of chum salmon. Last seen the whales moved back out into the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca by noon.

Jim Maya of Maya's Charters called at

1:15 pm
to report members of L pod out west at Bechy Head, heading west. At

9:30 - 10am
all three pods were at Lime Kiln.

I went for a hike along East Sooke Park trail today and spotted quite a few orca heading west (offshore Bechey Head). This was at

11:00
. I figured they were a group of Offshores or Northerns as I had just recieved a call that all of the Southern Residents were at Limekiln light at
10:00. I informed the only two whale-watching boats out of Victoria that were on the water at this time and they determined that it was L pod with a positive ID of L 57. From talking to them it seems as though it was only the L 25's. Maybe the L 12's stayed back at San Juan with the J's and K's. I drove to Sheringham lighthouse and watched them cruise by within a mile of shore. It looked as though they were successfully catching fish as there were many seagulls following along with them. I observed a lot of tail-lobbing and cartwheels. They passed Point no Point at

15:30
and were making great time with the ebb tide.

Lpod slipped by Victoria this morning but were found off Beechy Head (just west of Race Rocks) at
1203

A humpback known locally as "Whitey," as his tail under side is almost all white was found 1.5 miles east of Albert Head at
1345
.
