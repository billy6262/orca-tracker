Orca Sightings for November 6, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research sent another update - they left the orcas just north of Kingston on Thursday afternoon & had confirmed only J's & K's present at that time.
*

3:30 PM
--very spread out--well over a dozen orcas but mobing too fast and too spread out for an accurate count. Heading from Point No Point tward Possession--or at least on that trajectory, anyway.

I had T20 and T21 (Transient orcas) this afternoon from Mitchell Bay to Sentinel Island where they made a probably but discreet kill (milling whales and diving birds). I think I saw a chunk of something in T21's mouth. They then headed east down Spieden Channel, then north a little at the east tip of Spieden Island and then I left them heading east again just south of Flattop Island near sunset.

11:20 am
- Virginia Lindsay called to report orcas heading south past Bush Pt., w. Whidbey Island.
*

12:30 pm
- Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research was with at least J's and K's, in mid-Admiralty Inlet near Point No Point.
*
Noon
- We drove over to the west side of Whidbey, & found the orcas between Pt. No Pt. & Scatchet Hd. There were at least 2 dozen in a resting pattern across the strait, heading south. They were quite a distance from us but we were able to count the blows easily as they all surfaced together in a long line. There were three other small groups behind the large group, with 3 - 6 whales in each group, possibly a total of approx. 40 whales.
We followed them south, saw them again across from Maxwelton Beach (

12:45
), then went down to Scatchet Head (
1 -
1:30
) as they continued south from Pt. No Point. From Scatchet Head we also saw the Mukilteo Mystery whale! There was a
gray whale
just off Possession Pt, heading up toward Mukilteo - must be the critter reported from the ferry by folks recently.

- We just received a call from Elsa Leavitt reporting several small, tight groups of orcas heading south off Bush Pt, west Whidbey Island......those of you on south west Whidbey & points south better grab your binocs & head to the shoreline!
