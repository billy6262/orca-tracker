Orca Sightings for November 10, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
T46's at
1500
just west of Race Rocks. It looked like they made a kill at Bentick Island and then proceeded through Race Passage on an easterly heading. We left them at
1630
offshore of Pedder Bay.
Mother and calf humpback earlier in the day 3 miles south west of Race Rocks.
