Orca Sightings for November 2, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research just called, saying they were looking for L pod off the west side of San Juan island, but hadn't found them yet. They were responding to an earlier report of L pod inbound, which we also just received - see below.

Just got in from a windy, wild ride with L pod near Race Rocks. I first picked them up at

11:15
3 miles south of Race Rocks (thanks to an anonymous call over the VHF "I've got the whales!"). It looked like all of L pod as I saw all of the sprouters and L57 and L 41. There could have been J's and K's nearby as they were spread out over at least 2 miles. They were making between 4 and 6 knots in an easterly direction.
