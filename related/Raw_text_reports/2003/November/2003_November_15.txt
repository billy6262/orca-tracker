Orca Sightings for November 15, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 Orca swimming from south to north.
Where: Directly west of the lighthouse at West Point, in Discovery Park, Seattle WA. At their closest, I'd say they were about 100-150' off-shore.
When: 2003 Nov 15 Saturday about

12:00-
12:30PM.
Direction: swimming from somewhere further south, towards the north.
Activity: Forward motion seemed to be the task at hand. They seemed to be moving in a pretty direct line and didn't noticeably stop for any feeding or other activity. Most of the time, only one would surface at a time. For quite a while, I was doubting my earlier sighting of 2 and thinking it may just be a single one -- then, as they got further away to the north, I again had a few looks at 2 surfacing together. Given the way that 2 looked like 1 for a long time, it seems possible that more than 2 were out there.

From the Washington birders list: Today my family and I took a boat ride out to Destruction Protection Island and Dungeness Spit. About a mile west of Protection Island we came across five orcas (2 adult females, 2 juv, and 1 calf). They were quite active as we approached, breaching and splashing their tails on the water. As we got closer I noticed a harbor seal in the middle of the group. For the next 20 minutes, they tossed the seal around between them like a beach ball. My assumption was that this behavior was the females giving the youngsters a hunting lesson. Then they all disappeared for a few minutes. Then the orcas surfaced along with miscellaneous seal parts. These seal parts then attracted a large group of gulls. In with the gulls was one NORTHERN FULMAR.

Tom McMillen called at

3:10 pm
to report J's & K's between Pt. No Point (Kitsap Peninsula) & Possession Pt (S. Whidbey Island), still heading north.

We saw about 7-10 Orcas off of West Point (just S. of Ballard)
between noon and 1pm
. They were swimming north. We had a female and a young whale swim directly under our moving sail boat. Both rolled upside down as they swam under the boat. The whales were fairly spread out and did not appear to be bothered by the boats under sail.

Another update from Tom McMillen - they have at least J & K pods, spread out between Wells Pt. and Kingston. The whales have now turned & are heading north toward Possession Pt.
