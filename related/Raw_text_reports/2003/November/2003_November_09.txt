While Ron Bates was watching a single humpback within a couple of miles of Beacon Hill...the rest of us were out west of Race Rocks with T20 and 21 or waching the mom and calf humpbacks near Constance Bank. Ian from Naturally Salty Excursions first picked up T20 and 21 at Bentick Island (near Race Rocks) at

12:00
. He watched them make a kill on a jovenile stellar sealion. They then proceeded west. I left them at
1330
1 mile south of Becher Bay. On my way home I stumbled into the single humpback that Ron had been watching. At
1530
I received a call from Jeff on Wildside that he picked up T61 southeast of Constance Bank headed west. I left T61 and 1645 approaching Race Rocks.
