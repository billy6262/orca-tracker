Ken Balcomb called this afternoon to say some fishermen had reported seeing a pod of orcas between Kingston and Shilshole (N. Seattle) this morning. I headed over to the west side of Whidbey at about 3 pm to see if I could see any whales, & on the way got a call from Elsa Leavitt, reporting a pod of orcas heading north past Bush Pt (west Whidbey) at
3 pm
- what timing! I got to Bush Pt. at about

3:25 pm
, & watched the pod as they were heading north of Bush Pt, spread out between Marrowstone & Whidbey. 1 male was way out front (looked like J1, but too far out for a positive ID), the rest were spread out or in small groups heading north. Then the lead male turned to head south as he neared Ft. Flagler, & others in the group also turned south, while some were still heading north, & it became apparent they were busy fishing & going in all directions! At about
4 pm
I drove up to Lagoon Pt, the next point north, & watched from there as they continued north, & continued their milling & fishing. When I left them at

4:30
, they still hadn't gone any further north than Ft. Flagler, & seemed to be staying a little closer to the Whidbey side of the inlet.
