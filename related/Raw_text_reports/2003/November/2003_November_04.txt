Orca Sightings for November 4, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I also thought I saw a gray on Tuesday, from the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry. I was on the
5:00 ferry. I saw it blowing, which is what caught my eye in the first place. Then a big huge fluke.

I was on that ferry and my friend Jim, Langley, saw the whale described in David Freed's report just before the boat pulled from the dock leaving Mukilteo. (

5:00 PM
) Jim saw a large blow, followed by what he described as a "classic" tail fluke. He described it as looking like a Grey whale, or possibly a Humpback. We were all puzzled, much like your initial report from David, by the timing of this sighting.

I overheard two ham radio guys saying that there was a whale seen off of the

5:00 pm
Mukilteo to Clinton ferry, somewhere mid-channel. The crew was saying it was a Gray.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called with more reports. It was J's & K's, going back & forth in the Bainbridge/Vashon/Seattle area, going from Eagle Harbor south to Restoration Pt then north to Shilshole. At

3:45
they were spread out between Bainbridge Island and Seattle, at

4:30
they were at Shilshole going north.
*
Happy to say we saw at least 20 orcas heading north on the Bainbridge/Seattle ferry today at around

2:30
(roughly mid-channel)!

No swans or killer whales but at least four humpbacks off Victoria all day. I see that myself and others made a spelling error yesterday it is Beechey Head.

Jeff Hogan called at
3 pm
to report the whales had turned & headed north again, now they are near the Bainbridge Island ferry run, near the Winslow Ferry Landing.
*
11 am
- Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report the orcas were 1 mile due north of the Vashon ferry dock, looking like they might head down the east side of Vashon. He called at

11:10
to say they were getting closer, and there were a lot more than 12 whales present, including at least a few mature males. At

11:20
Jeff Hogan called back to say it looked like it could possibly be all three pods - LOTS of whales. He positively ID'd J1, and thought he saw L41.
*

11:38 am
- Marilyn Dahlheim called with a report, and also emailed it: Just heard from my husband Bob aboard the Crowley Tug "Guide". Spotted a very large number of killer whales (large bulls too) off the Faultleroy Ferry Dock at
1138
heading southbound. They were very spread out!

We just got a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters, who recieved a call from Chris Sly on Bainbridge Island, reporting a pod of approx. 12 orcas heading south off Bainbridge at

9:45 am
, no males present.
