Orca Sightings for November 26, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Anna spotted the blows of the mother and calf humpback just south of Race Rocks. Within a few minutes upon arrival we experienced the most amazing sight both of us have ever seen with a humpback. The calf breached beside the boat within 40 feet and then swam underneath the boat and breached again within just a few feet. Anybody that was on the back deck wore a fair bit of water from the splash. The calf continued breaching for a few more minutes before it joined the mom on a line for Constance Bank.
