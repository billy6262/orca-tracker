============================================================

Entry 1:
And Stefanie Hawks called in to update 1/11's reports on K and L pods - they left them at

Hi Susan,
We had a great day with Ks and Ls with Tom and left them at

heading North past Crown Hill (Shilshoe Marina).

Tom McMillen's last report of K and L pods was at

2:55pm
, with the pods spread out between West Pt. (just north of Seattle) and Wells Pt (just south of Edmonds, and heading north at a slow, leisurely pace.
*

1:15 pm
: Tom just called back - Candi Emmons of the Center for Whale Research has ID'd the whales in Elliott Bay as the K and L pod whales they saw yesterday. The pod has turned and is now heading due west out of Elliott Bay. There is another pod over near Magnolia Bluff as well.
*

1:10 pm
: Laurie Davidson called to report seeing the orcas in Elliott Bay - one male orca present.
*
Approximately 5 Orca's at Point Whitney on Dabob Bay in Hood Canal. They were traveling North into Dabob Bay fairly close to shore at our location. There was one male. I didn't get close enough to see or photgraph the whales. We were kayaking, after hearing about the transient Orcas that came into Hood Canal. Our encounter was brief, but exciting. No playing or obvious feeding. The time was

1:10 PM
.
Thank you, Karl Hadley

1 pm
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report the whales are now in front of Safeco Field in Seattle (is there a game today?!!). They can see one adult male - will get back to us with ID's soon.
*

12:30 am
: Hi Susan,
My wife Amanda just woke me to the sound of about a dozen or so whales headed North. The halfmoon keeps her secrets well but Amanda swears she heard J8 again. They were traveling in 2 groups one in front, sporadic blows, the second a whole symphony of blows. One real tiny blow in there with them. Great way to finish off the Friday whale show.

12:05
-- off Magnolia Bluff now, close in and active - will they go downtown?!?!
John and Joyce Loftus, Alki Beach, Seattle

NOON
: The whales are now right off of West Point and quite active, although they spend a lot of time underwater. There are at least 8-12 whales, including at least on large male. They appear to be fishing a rip tide.
*
We are seeing whales off Bainbridge Island opposite West Point, just saw one do a triple breach, can't tell how many or what direction. They are quite far from us. It's

10:15
. There are a few boats near the whales.
John & Joyce Loftus, Alki Beach

We just heard from Tom McMillen, who was watching a pod of orcas from a hillside in Seattle. The orcas were between Bainbridge Island (near West Pt) and Seattle, mid channel. They first were heading north, but at
10 am
turned south. No ID's yet.
