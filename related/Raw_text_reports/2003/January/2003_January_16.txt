this morning, I heard the "blow" and grabbed my binoculars. A huge bull was rising up, blowing, then repeating this action while headed in a southern direction. Unlike earlier cruisings, which occur on about a 12 hour interval, near to shore where the seals hang out, this time the Orca group was in the middle of Dabob Bay. Dabob Bay is one mile across and maybe six miles deep (the latter a guess). He did have a distinctive dorsal pattern...At one point, three little dorsals, close together, appeared together, alternating with the large one. Oddly, just two hours later, I again heard a blow. I ran outside and saw the Trident Nuclear Sub following on the exact same path as the Orca, except headed South instead of North. It was doing a "quick submerge," with water gushing up at each end. The middle of Dabob Bay is one of the deepest inland waters in the continental US. A neighbor describes an Orca in front of her house "chasing" a seal, which dodged every which way trying to escape. She did not witness the outcome. The shorebirds, all relatively rare species, are back along the shoreline. When the Orca were cruising the eastern shoreline of Dabob Bay, the shorebirds went somewhere else.
