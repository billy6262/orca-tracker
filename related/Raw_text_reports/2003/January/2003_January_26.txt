Orca Sightings for January 26, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a group of whales across the canal from the winery heading south today Jan 26 at about 1PM. There were some fins and some blowing but with no binoculars it was hard to see how many. About

2:30PM
we saw one lone whale in front of Hoodsport heading north. The fin surfaced about 6 times before it was completely out of our view. What a thrill.

Just wanted to let you know that the pod(s) are still in Hood Canal. Seen about 4 heading south down Hood Canal in the Lilliwaup area at

11:30 a.m.
. There was the one that everyone is calling T-14 in the pod. Then at

13:30 -
14:00
they came back north. The following is on the return trip at

13:00
. Seen them in the canal at about mile post 323. Where I live, which is about .5 up from the water you could see the dorsal fin of one. There looked to be about 4-6 in this pod. Was not surfacing to much. as extremely windy and rough water, and was traveling faster then we had seen them just the past Sunday. Please take note that last Sunday when we seen this same group that there was a boat circling them at a rapid speed. In what looked like a close area. Today did not see any boat around them.
Thank you so much for the information that you provide for the novice whale watcher.
