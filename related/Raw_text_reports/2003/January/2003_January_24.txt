Orca Sightings for January 24, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I got this report of orcas off Dungeness Spit: Mike Rauch of Port Angeles called to report a pod of orcas passing the Lighthouse at the tip of Dungeness Spit at around
2 pm
. There were 9 - 12 orcas, 1 male, and several smaller orcas. They were spread out, with some smaller groups traveling close together.
*
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters just called in a report of at least L pod (he says there are lots of whales, and he hasn't seen or ID'd them all yet). He first saw them off Possession Pt, south Whidbey Island, heading south at

1:20 pm
. At

1:45
they were nearing the Edmonds/Kingston area (north of Seattle), and had slowed down a bit to forage in the riptide. So those of you down south, get out to your bluffs and beaches, look out your windows, and let us know if you see any fins!

4:30
, with the orcas nearing Shilshole (just north of Seattle) at

4:30 pm
, and still heading south, doing lots of foraging. He has identified K and L pod whales, but hadn't seen any of J pod. He did see both L67 and K16 with their calves.

Hi
I heard the whale's out front of our cabin last night around
9:30 just south of Ayok Point. They sounded really close. They were doing alot of blowing. They were driving my dogs crazy.
