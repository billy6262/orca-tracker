Orca Sightings for January 13, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hood Canal Orca, number unknown, passed close to east shore of Dabob Bay, between Brinnon and Quilcene, at

6:15 PM
. The exact location was between Whitney Point Shellfish Lab and Pulali Point, Off Lot 5, Section 18, Township 26 N, Range 1 West, Willamette Meridian. They were moving, didn't stay in one place. They seem to be maintaining their stroll along the east Dabob coastline. That is where the seals are. All the migratory birds that were hanging out, red necked grebes, loons, etc, seem to have taken off since the Orca showed up. --
