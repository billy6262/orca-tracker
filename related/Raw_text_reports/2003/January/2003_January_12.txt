Orca Sightings for January 12, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received a call from Karen Holland reporting a pod of orcas in Hood Canal again this morning at

11:30
. They were in the Stetson Beach area, on the east side of the canal just south of Ayok Pt, headed south - she could see two blows. Most likely part of the Transient pod that's been in the area the past week or so.

Hi
At least 20 offshores off Victoria this afternoon (Jan 12) going East. I first spotted them at
1401
right off the waterfront, at first I thought I had transients but they kept coming. Also a number of babies, and at last 2 males with those shorter dorsal fins.
