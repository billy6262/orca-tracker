Orca Sightings for January 18, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw three Orcas in Hood Canal this last Saturday, 1/18/03. The time was around
1pm
. There appeared to be one male, large fin, a female and a baby. They were heading north. Location was at Hoodsport. They seemed to be heading out to sea as they were swimming constantly and not stopping.

We could see them today at Potlatch State Park south of Hoodsport. They were at first pretty far out and closer to the other side of the Canal, but at one point came closer and right out in front of the Park and put on quite a show breaching. Then some idiot went right up to them in a boat and they disappeared. I was concerned that no one was around to prevent this type of behavior. Most boaters were keeping their distance. They were seen heading north only briefly after that. It seems they are still in the area they have been reported all week. But we stayed around for several hours then drove home along the Canal heading north and never saw them again as night fall came. We did see a lot of seals close to shore quite a ways north, but saw no sign of the whales there.

On 18th were opposite Hoodsport nearer the east shore with much blowing, and splashing. Too far away and difficult light conditions for good identification and exact action going on. They turned southeast towards the Union area and Skokomish delta region. Where we were, north of Hoodsport, there were many seals in very close to shore and staying up near surface. Never saw the orcas rest of the day. On 19th heard many reports along the road of one pod around Hoodsport and then when pod moved north, 2nd pod joined in trail also moving north about
3.00pm
