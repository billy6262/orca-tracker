Hi Susan,
We have finally been able to accumulate enough photos thanks to Steve Jeffries, Josh London, Brian McLaughlin, and Chris Dunnagan and Larry Steagall from the Bremerton Sun, to be able to identify most of the transients that have been frequenting Hood Canal for the past few weeks. We haven't been able to positively identify all the calves, so made some assumptions based on the females present.
The list includes: T014, T073, T073A, T073B, T073C, T074, T077, T077A, T077B, T123, T123A. It is possible there are more animals that were not photographed, but 11 is the total number that show up in the pictures.
Hope this is of interest to your readers.
Cheers,
Graeme and John

Aloha Susan,
I was delighted to see what may have been a pod of Dahls porpoises in Saratoga Passage this afternoon about 3 pm. They appeared to be headed north from between Greenbank and Camano Island, but suddenly showed up right off Fox Spit. It looked like they were feeding, as they went back and forth and over towards Camano Island. Then i lost sight of them. Nice to see our friends out there, and if they are eating what orcas eat, maybe the local residents will be coming by for a snack soon!
