One lone male orca chasing seals off my beach

11:00
this morning. Saw 2 seals swimming faster than I have ever seen, they would surface about every 20 feet, swimming like a porpoise. The whale was about 200 yards away, the only one I saw. Just saw off the beach what looked like a seal lion swimming on the surface, not sure but it could have been a baby orca, didn't see a dorsal fin though, but longer than a seal.
