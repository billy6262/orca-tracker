Orca Sightings for August 23, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
About
1PM

August 23 saw a single Orca approximately 2 miles west of the Edmonds Ferry dock headed north. The Orca had its dorsal fin bent over to the right. I did not see any other whales.

Jim Maya of Maya's Whale Charters called in a report of all three pods spread out off False Bay (west side of San Juan Island) and heading SE at
8 pm
, after spending a day of socializing together. He also said there were more pink salmon jumping out of the water than he's ever seen before...(that should make for happy whales!)
He also said Sea Quest out of Sidney BC reported a pod of 3 to 4 Transients (the T18's) Aug. 23rd off Gooch Island, west of Spieden and Stuart Islands.
