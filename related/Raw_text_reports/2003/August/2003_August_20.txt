Orca Sightings for August 20, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Karen and I sat in our little boat in front of the Center for Whale Reseach (west side of San Juan Island) and watched J, K and L pod go by on both sides of the boat. Best
lunch hour
of our life.

Not much to add re the transients on the 19th except for all the talk there never was an adult male. Today J, K and Lpod going E from Sooke at
0630
, vanished for a while in the fog. In the late morning J's, K's and a few L's raced up North and were in Swanson Ch. in the afternoon. The rest of L,s between Salmon and Hein bank in the late afternoon.

4:19 PM
- Just received a report of a small pod of three orcas in Saratoga Passage, approx. one mile off the west side of Camano Island at Sunset Beach, headed south. This means they should soon be visible from the East Greenbank area, so we're headed out to the bluff to take a look-see. Sounds like one of the Transient pods that have been around, maybe the T-18's? No obvious mature male was reported - we'll let you know if we find them -

Jim Maya called this
morning
to report the Southern Residents back along the west side of San Juan Island at 11 am. He had J's & K's 2 or 3 miles off False Bay, heading north from Hein Bank to False Bay; and other whales, most likely L's, further out and heading in.
