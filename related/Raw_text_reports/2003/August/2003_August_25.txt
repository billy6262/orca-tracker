Orca Sightings for August 25, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Overcast skies did little to dampen spirits as we had the good fortune to observe most of L-Pod
around noon
as they headed North towards Henry Island. Lots of activity as most of the L's were traveling together, with the L-12's following a ways behind them. As they rounded Henry Island, they stayed extremely close to the rock face. Lots of spyhops, breaches, tail slaps, but no vocalizations.
Later that evening
, we once again observed L-Pod as they continued their northerly trek past Eastpoint heading towards the Fraser River. About

5:30
, we saw J Pod in President's Channel between Orcas Island and Waldron Island heading westerly. They were very tightly grouped as if in a resting phase. It was so incredible to see most every member come to the surface simultaneously. At

6:30 PM
we left the scene with J's heading towards San Juan Channel.
