Orca Sightings for August 28, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
All three pods moved north up the island. First, all of J pod came by Land Bank, high porpoising all the way past. They were followed by K and L pods. L pod came back south later, while the J's and K's continued north.

Capt. Hollywood called again at

4:11
to report he was with the transients about 1.5 miles west of Deception Pass bridge. They were mostly milling, but moving slowly southward toward Smith Island.

We had a great transient show near Skagit Bay this morning. T14 (Pender) was definitely present as well as possibly the T46's with that tiny little calf and 3 others that I couldn't identify. They took 2 Harbor Seals. Fortunately for the seals it was over pretty quickly. It looked like the females did most of the work while Pender supervised (I'll refrain from saying anything about a typical male). After we went to Friday Harbor and then visited with L12's for a few minutes we came back and the transients had gone through Deception Pass! We caught them resting in Rosario Strait. They were heading south, so this may have been a short visit, but a welcome one as I personally hadn't seen Pender in 3 years.

North of Henry Island, we spotted J Pod approaching. But a large cargo ship was passing by, and as we got closer we observed 6-8 J Pod orcas surfing in the wake of the cargo ship! They were speeding along, and would literally burst out of the wake in a large splash of water. The orcas were in a playful mood today with lots of vocalizations to accompany the breaches, spy hops, and splashing!
