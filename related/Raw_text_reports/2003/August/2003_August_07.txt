We had an interesting sighting today. We were in the middle of Haro Strait when J-pod (
note: see report below for correction of whale ID
) was coming back in from the west. As they passed right under the boat about 15 of them breached - one after another on each side of the boat. I had never seen so many of them breach all at once. Then, about 15 minutes later we were observing what appeared to be 4 whales kelping. Before we knew it, two of them came up right beside the boat with something in between them. At first I thought it was a large fish, but it was a mammal. The two whales were helping the little one breathe. It was about 2 -3 feet long and gray. My first inclination was that it was a baby orca, and then after it was gone, I began thinking that it could have been a harbor porpoise. The breaching behavior right before all this occurred and the way the two whales were helping it breathe really mad me think it was a newborn orca. I've heard of L's interacting with porpoise, but I've never heard anything about J's. It was an amazing sight regardless and I would love to hear from anyone else who may have seen this or who has ideas as to what may have been happening.

Some of our staff and ew'ers were on the boat with tom yesterday and saw a porpoise get harassed by some whales They thought they were the L5s...they have pictures and video, but we haven't looked at it yet. Apparently the whales had the porpoise for 2 hours and there was another porpoise in the area. After the 2 hours the porpoise did swim away (probably to go off and die from a massive heart attack or the likes).
