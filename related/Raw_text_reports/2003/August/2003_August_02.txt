Orca Sightings for August 2, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had several (at least 3) feeding minke whales at Hein Bank. They were allowing the birds to gather up the fish in a bait ball, then the minke's would lunge through the middle of the ball taking huge swallows of fish! A late report of whales took us over to Victoria to see K's & L's coming back in the area! Lots of spy hopping, and boy is it good to have the black and whites back near the islands!

Kim Hallahan called to report the Transient pod of orcas off Polnell Pt (near Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island) from
4-5 pm
. She said it appeared they came in from the east, but weren't really going anywhere, just breaching and playing off the point! They saw at least 5 orcas.
*
In the afternoon whales everywhere off Victoria going east.
