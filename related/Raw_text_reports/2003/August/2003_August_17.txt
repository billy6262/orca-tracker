We joined J, K, and L Pods (yessiree, another great Superpod day) several miles off of the West side of San Juan Island between Hannah Heights and Lime Kiln. All three pods were interspersed and milling in no apparent direction. Off in the distance, we could hear other people oohing and ahhing over the splashing of the orcas as they fed in the abundant humpy (salmon). And then it happened...(pause for suspense). Across the bow of the boat came 3-4 whales. Always exciting. And then the vocalizations picked up in tempo. Something was up. A few seconds later, excited splashing accompanied corkscrewing like motions, lunging, and we knew the orcas had found some fish in front of us. Before we knew it, the vocalizations were loud as the orcas came from all around to join in the all-you-can-eat buffet! But the best was yet to come! We saw what we called the nursery group approach the boat. As this group of 2-3 females and 2 babies came closer, they were joined by Ruffles, Cappucino, Splash, and others. Soon, as if to show off their offspring, the mom's were actually hoisting the babies out of the water on top of their heads!!! INCREDIBLE! I could just picture the little ones saying "Mooommmmm...stop it-you're embarrassing me!" Ruffles came up and was actively making almost a growling-type noise from his blowhole as several females caroused around him. Several times the whales would linger on the surface making vocalizations while a certain naturalist (name withheld so I won't incriminate myself) was stunned! Without a doubt, these whales left their mark on everyone who beheld them today! I now have a new best whale day ever. Thank you J,K, and L-Pod!
