Orca Sightings for August 27, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
L41 (Mega) became romantically involved with a tall-finned female (yes, female--they both came belly up several times) just off Land Bank south of Lime Kiln. Mega appeared to be similarly involved with the same female up at County Park, with other orcas, including at least one juvenile, attempting to join in the fun.

Tom McMillen called at

11:30
with 8 transients off Ebey's Landing (west Whidbey Island), heading south. Some CWR people are on board, and they ID'd T14. There is also a pink newborn calf. At

12:15
they were even with the Keystone ferry route, closer to the Whidbey side, still heading south.

L pod went south through Active Pass at around
1830
and passed by the CWR (west side San Juan Island) from
2200
to
2230ish
. Some sounded quite close from the hydrophone and blows. The L pod whale that has a J8-esque wheeze is L54. Part of our crew just got back from an encounter with T14, T46, and others. I haven't taken a close look at the pics yet but apparently there were about 8 whales there including one new calf. The boat left them heading into Admiralty Inlet.
And finally the Northern Residents.... well, we got some pictures back that were taken from the Annie Mae during the big evening showdown and the only whale we can ID is (drum roll please) L73. If anyone else has pics from that evening we'd love to see them, but I think it's pretty safe to say that it was L pod, not Northern Residents. It seems highly unlikely that a big group of NR's could have snuck in past all the boats from Victoria and/or down Haro Strait without being seen to show up right where a bunch of L pod whales were seen only minutes before (according to Soundwatch and Tom McMillan of Salish Sea Charters).
