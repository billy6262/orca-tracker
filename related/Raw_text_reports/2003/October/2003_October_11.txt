Orca Sightings for October 11, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found the orcas off Lagoon Pt, west Whidbey Island at

10:30 am
, very spread out from the Whidbey side to mid-strait and slowly heading north. Lots of tail slapping, a few breaches, but difficult conditions with wind, rain & lots of white caps. I saw at least one large male, but didn't get a real good count due to waves and how spread out the pod was. The Center for Whale Research is headed north to catch up with the pod, so hopefully we'll have some ID's by the end of the day.

We received a call from Christina Baldwin at

9:50 am
this morning, reporting a large pod of orcas between Mutiny Bay & Bush Pt, west Whidbey Island. She said there were at least 12 orcas and at least one large male. They were porpoising slowly northward, splashing & fishing. I'll get out to see if I can find them, though the weather isn't quite as good for watching whales today!
