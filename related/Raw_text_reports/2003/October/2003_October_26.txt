Orca Sightings for October 26, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
We got to spend some nice time watching a Humpback whale off of Victoria this afternoon. It would come to the surface for an average of four respirations between an average of six minute dives. Most dives entailed an arching of the peduncle but only two showed "fluking" before diving. Fluking behavior did not noticeably increase dive time. Aspect to animal was not conducive to getting an "ID" shot of the fluke's underside. It did appear to be a fairly large animal, at least 30 feet (best guess).
(Note: It seems as though there are at least 8 individuals that have been around over the last month. This includes a mother and calf which have been around for over a month. Every time a boat goes out to find the two of them we come across at least one of the other ones. I am pretty sure there have been 9 but there is a juvenile out there that never lifts his or her tail flukes up for an id shot.)
Approximately 25+ Steller Sea Lions on Whale Rocks. Half were enjoying the last of the sun's rays and quite a few were cavorting in the water around the rocks. Saw one chasing a salmon that jumped out of the water to get away...don't think it did.
