Orca Sightings for October 7, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
My guests just returned from watching the whales at Lime Kiln Lighthouse. They said they were there from about
2 to
2:45 PM
. Several very close to shore and many more further out.

Orcas swimming along San Juan's West Side, slowly trending towards the south. The sun (yes, sun) was reflecting on the water making an ID sketchy, but it looked like L Pod out there!
