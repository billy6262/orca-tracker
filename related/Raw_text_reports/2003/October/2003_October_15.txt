Orca Sightings for October 15, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Well, we started with a single humpback. Then a Mumn and calf. Next we had 3 at once and now we have 4 humpbacks off Victoria today, including the Mum and calf.

- We received a call from the Bremerton Naval Shipyard, reporting a lone baby orca hanging around the pier and docks. I asked if they could see any white on it, so the caller went out to check and reported it didn't - he also said he had just heard from someone else that this whale seems to like tug boats, so I'd say it sounds like "Wilter", the False Killer Whale that was off Whidbey last week.

) followed them from Port Angeles to Tacoma yesterday afternoon (Oct. 14) and from Tacoma to Bremerton this morning. Received report from Puget Sound Shipyard that he is there this morning (Oct. 15) hanging out..
