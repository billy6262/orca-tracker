Orca Sightings for October 22, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
"Wilster" (sp) (the Pseudorca) off Victoria from about
0730 -0800
. Seen from the breakwater and the "harbour patrol" Last seen going East.
Humpbacks - had Mum and Calf, radio talk indicated 2 more out by Sooke, later talk said there were 2 more E. of Sooke. We may have 6 Humpbacks off Victoria. I have seen 3 myself.

At
3 pm
one (or possibly two) orcas came very close to one of OrcaSound's hydrophones near Smugglers Cove on the west side of San Juan Island. The vocalizations are like none heard here before. A short description and a
sample sound are on the web
under Orca Vocalization. After coming to within a few feet of one hydrophone, the orca (or orcas) sped off to the south porpoising parallel to a purse seiner.
p.s. The FM radio at this site has been re-tuned to 88.1 to avoid radio interference with a station on Vancouver Island. If you are within a mile of Smugglers Cove, listen to the underwater sounds on your radio!

We (actually it was David Howitt who thought of it) think it might be a pseudorca. This
July 23rd we recorded a psuedorca (? Willy) off Cracroft Point. This little whale only emitted a single call type in our recording but there is a similar quality to the sounds in this latest recording. Let us know what anyone else suggests.

This makes sense, with Ron Bates' sighting of "Wilster" (Wilma, Willy, Foster the Pseudorca) off Victoria on the 22nd, & the recording Val Veirs made of the weird sounds was also on the 22nd off west San Juan Island - thanks Helena & David! sb
