Orca Sightings for October 10, 2003
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dale and I were down at the Mukilteo State Park a little after 4pm, talked to one gal that had heared the Orcas came through around
3pm
and heard they might be heading back north where we were. At
5:15pm Komo 4 news had just started the "live" story of Luna about his family being in the area when we spotted another group of 7 over by the Clinton ferry dock heading south so of course Komo 4 zoomed in on them. At one point they appeared to be feeding for awhile and then continued to the south end of Whidbey Island.

I finally found the whales between Edmonds & Mukilteo, close to the mainland side of the passage, at about

1:30pm
this afternoon. There were several large groups - one group was further north, heading south, with 3 or 4 mature males, the other group was further south, heading north, with 1 or 2 mature males. When I first saw them, they were both in very tight groups - what a sight to see all those dorsals so close together! The two pods met up into one big pod for a moment or two, then disappeared for a bit, then one pod continued south while the other continued north. I watched until a little after two, with the southern group nearly to Edmonds, and the northern group nearly to Mukilteo. There were many small fishing boats out in the same area the whales were (for the same reason!), & the pods seemed to just converge on the boats and go right through them!
Apparently they've been spending the day swimming back and forth from N. Seattle to Mukilteo - here are other reports that have come in throughout the day, beginning with the most recent report from Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research -

Dave Ellifrit just called in a report at
6 pm
- they had finally caught up with the pods about an hour before, and so far had identified J and K pods, the L-12's, L7, L53, & L57, and believe other L's are around as well. They found them off the S. Whidbey/Edmonds area, headed south, and at 6 pm they had reached Shilshole, where the pod stopped and seemed to be milling. There may be more whales further north at this time...

KOMO 4 News had great live footage of one of the pods off Mukilteo at

5:15 pm
, and had earlier footage of the whales from 3 pm.

We just got a treat on the

3:00 Pm
Mukilteo ferry as we saw the same pod of Orcas (approx 15-20) that has been playing around all day. They came up from the south very close to the lighthouse and kept heading nothward on their way to Everett. Now that was a tgif treat for all of us!

John Yeagar of Q13 News said they found whales at noon off Richmond Beach (just south of Edmonds), heading north. At
1 pm
. they were between Edmonds and Mukilteo, which is where I picked them up.

At

9:05am
we counted what we think were about 18-20 heading south, fairly close to shore off North Beach, Ballard [off Meadow Pt. in north Seattle], traveling at a pretty good clip.

At

9:50
or so this morning I saw lots of Orcas. Looked like all 3 pods together...off the east side of Whidbey between Whidbey and Hat. They were headed north slowly.
