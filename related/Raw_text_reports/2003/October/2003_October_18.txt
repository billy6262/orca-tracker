============================================================

Entry 1:
...at

12:10
I picked up 5 or 6 Transients off of Trial Island heading east. I positively id'd T 20 and 21. There was one other bull and 1 or 2 other females with a fairly young animal. I watched them hunt in the kelp bed off of Discovery Island for almost 45 minutes before they went out into some very ugly sea conditions in Haro Strait. I left when the
1:00 boats arrived but they unfortunately lost them in the 6 foot seas. They were last seen at around

14:00
near Beaumont Shoals heading towards Pile Pt.
Mallard
p.s. I mentioned that I would confirm the T's that were with T 14 on
September 17 inbound off of Victoria. They were the T 23 group.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called this morning to report J & K pods off west San Juan Island at
10 am
, near the Center for Whale Research, heading north. Tom called back at
2 pm
to say they were off Mowaut Pt., Pender Island still heading north.

Saw one or 2 pods of Orcas today in the Puget Sound due West of West Point in Seattle. It was close to
3.30 pm
. There were about 30-40 animals and they were traveling North with the current.
