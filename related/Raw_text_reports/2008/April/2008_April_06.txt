Orca Sightings for April 6, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

4:30 pm
I saw two
orcas
travelling N then NW from my house on Mitchell Point off SJI. There was a male with a very tall fin and a female.
Gretchen Bailey, San Juan Island
The Center for Whale Research confirmed these were Transient orcas T20 and T21.

One
gray whale
raced by Whidbey Shores/East Point at

6:30 PM
. Very limited feeding. Then 2 grays feeding heavily about

9:30 PM
in same area.

Around
10PM
last night there was the familiar swishing of [
gray whale
] pectoral fins beating the water, then two clear blows from the beach below. They stayed only a short while.
Windwalker, Whidbey Island

I heard radio chatter that two
transients
were coming across from Discovery Island, so I kept watch. After a few hours I heard some chatter that these transients were near Lime Kiln, near the shore and were near a kayaker. One minute the whales were going north and the next south. Soon they made a decision and continued north. I was able to seem them as they passed-by Andrews Bay. One male and one female. Not long after, I received a phone call from Judith, who told me of seeing two whales, just a short while before, passing-by the lighthouse close to shore and one dove right under the kayaker!

I was out with Mystic Seas today - Patch (
Gray whale
# 49) did a beautiful breach at the entrance to Holmes Harbor. Then northbound we found two grays between Harrington and Race Lagoons, they were slowly heading south, AND about a half mile east of the wharf in Coupeville there was ANOTHER gray whale. I tried following him (via car) and caught up with him at Suzy Smith's house on Rhodena Drive, where we watched him slowly traveling south- eastward for about a half hour.

Carolyn Mercer called us at

12:55 pm
to report seeing a
gray whale
breach right off North Bluff, north of Greenbank. By the time we were able to get out to the bluff for some whale watching, it was

2:10 pm
. Howie spotted 1 gray whale diving, & ID'd it as Patch by the fluke pattern. He was out a ways & slowly heading north. We watched him spout a few more times. Then from the beach from

3:18 -
3:40 pm
, we saw a spout SW of Rocky Pt, Camano Island. The whale seemed to be heading west toward the entrance to Penn Cove at a pretty fast pace.
