Orca Sightings for April 24, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
A lone
Minke
Whale was sighted in Boundary Pass, just south of Blunden Island at approximately
2 PM
. By the time our boat arrived on scene, the whale was travelling in a mostly Eastbound direction, rambling a bit in a typical Minke fashion as it went. It showed absolutely no distress at the boats being in the vicinity, and even surfaced at one point aiming directly for our stopped vessel. Some lunge feeding was observed, with the rostrum just over the surface, and baleen just visible in its upper jaw. A closer inspection of a zoomed and cropped photo shows scars from what appears to be a boat propeller. On an otherwise whale-free day in our vicinity, this little Minke made the day for our passengers!

We just saw our first
Orcas
of the season. For sure there were 3 (1 male and 2 females) but there could possibly have been 4. They were right in front of the Whale Center in
Depoe Bay, OR
, less than a half mile out. They were heading north. We should have known something was up cause the bell buoy is full of steller sea lions jockeying for a safe position!
