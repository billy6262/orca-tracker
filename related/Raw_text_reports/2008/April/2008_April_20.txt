Orca Sightings for April 20, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I went for a flight at about

4:00 PM
Sunday afternoon. I had seen the whale watching boat head over towards Everett, so we flew that direction hoping to see some whales. Sure enough, we spotted
FIVE gray whales
feeding close to the Marine Marker between Gedney (Hat) Island and the entrance to Steamboat Slough! To see it on a chart click here. The whales were right near the marker, feeding close to the edge of the drop off. It was amazing watching the whales rolling on to their sides, feeding with big plumes of mud streaming out behind them and then coming up to breathe! (see photo above) There was a raft of scoters and other sea birds feeding on whatever the whales missed. Patch was easy to ID.

There were (still)
gray whales
close in to shore at First Beach at
La Push, WA
. I saw one good spyhop, several briefly emerging heads and many bits of backs. At least one pair of blows close together, half a second apart and nearly side by side: mother/baby?

When we got near the shallows just west of
Priest Point
, there they were. Three
grays
, one of them was Patch I believe. Lots of feeding and blowing. They seemed comfortable. Then as we were about to leave, one of them did a SPY HOP!!! Slowly and gracefully.
