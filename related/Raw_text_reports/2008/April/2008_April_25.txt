Orca Sightings for April 25, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw two adult
Grays
from the Clinton Ferry.

A group of
Transient
Orcas (I counted 7), in southwest Haro Strait, a ways offshore from Gordon Head. We definitely ID'ed
T14
, and were informed that the remainder of the group was the
T36A's and T49A's
. When we arrived, the T's were travelling slowly Westbound, doing typical long dives. A short time later, the whole group turned and headed Eastbound, now appearing to swim with a purpose in mind. Our Captain, wisely looking ahead, observed a Steller Sea Lion amongst a crowd of seagulls. The Sea Lion was obviously enjoying a fresh meal, and seemed oblivious to what was approaching from behind. We observed the T's lunge at the sea lion, and what followed was much splashing and turmoil at the surface, with the sea lion's flippers appearing several times, pointed upwards. There was an extended period of no action at the surface, followed by the departure of the T's, once again headed back in the direction from whence they came. We felt that was rather quick for the dispatch and consuming of an animal as large and powerful as a Steller. A minute later, the Steller appeared at the surface, heading away from the whales. Where we expected to witness a prolonged and possibly messy battle, we instead observed the prey putting on a brave and effective defence. There were some cheers for the sea lion, and some expressions of respect being heard over the radio. As the T's headed towards Discovery Island, we were finally able to finally get a closer look at them and observed that one female had some extensive damage to her dorsal fin on the left side. As this was the first time I had seen these T's this year, I don't know if the damage had been inflicted during the brief battle we witnessed, or if it had occurred earlier. A zoomed and cropped photo is attached (see above). Our passengers were thrilled with seeing the whales, and there was not one complaint about the long journey on a chilly April day to witness the amazing power of these top predators, even if they weren't successful, this time.

We sent this photo to the Center for Whale Research, and here is more background on this damaged fin - sb:
This is T36A. Mallard had her first with the rakes the same day we had our big group of transients and J pod on
April 5th. Her rakes were decidedly worse looking when Adam and I had the T49's and T36A on
April 16th. The rakes actually look a little better now than they did on the 16th.

We saw a total of five
[gray] whales
from mid- channel off Mukilteo to the south, north to Camano Head. We saw resting behaviors, traveling behaviors, feeding behaviors and, remarkably, SEVEN spyhops - from the same whale (#383 - see ID's in report below)! He certainly seemed quite interested in us.

We first saw
Patch
, #49, & #21 just off Gedney Island about 1/2 mile. We then found #383 who became the showstopper with 7...yes 7 spyhops just off the southern tip of Gedney Island!!! Amazing, my first time seeing a
Gray Whale
spyhop and it simply just took my breath away! Before heading back to the dock we found another whale, #22 near the delta.

Here are a couple of images of the
Transients
doing in a Steller sea lion. Sun, calm seas, and we were the only boat there. Amazing. Three miles east of Race Rocks,
1500
hrs.

Well, it's been a busy whale day for Haro Strait. First we had
transients
around

8:30 AM
heading SOUTH, then later a group of transients headed towards Race Rocks going west. Later this afternoon, around

3:30 pm
, I got a call saying all the transients were now heading in with the floodtide. So I wasn't too surprised at

9:30 PM
to hear a group of whales passing Kelp Reef. The water was so still you could see the lights of Victoria reflected on the water, and the sound of multiple whale blows clearly carried on the cool evening air!

There were up to 30
Orcas
feeding on a
gray whale
that they had killed on the 23rd (in Monterey Bay, CA)!

Mark Malleson of Victoria called at

11:29 am
to report Transient orca T14, "Pender" off Victoria, heading west. He also had 7
Transient
orcas - the T36A's & T49A's - off Race Rocks, heading east at the same time.
