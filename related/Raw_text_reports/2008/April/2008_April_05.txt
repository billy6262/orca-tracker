Orca Sightings for April 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We observed 12 or 13 members of
J pod
pass Thieves Bay on Pender Island. Positively identified J1, and quite certain that we also were watching J26 and his new sister J42 along with their mom J16. There appeared to be another male with this group. We speculated that it was J30. They moved by slowly between

3:30 and
4:00pm
, traveling north in Swanson Channel about 400-500 metres offshore. First sighting of the season for us. Has there been any sign of J43?

We had
Transients
off of Beecher Bay at
1pm
heading West towards Sooke. It looked like 6-8 in total, 3 + females 2 calves and 1 juvenile. Attached are a few pictures.

Mallard reported them as
T49A @ B, T36A
, and their kids-. The group we (Ctr. for Whale Research) had included T87, T88, the T124's, the T124A's, the T90's, and the T71's- 15 whales in this group and T14 was trailing the group when we got on them at Kellett Bluff. All were traveling north/northwest fairly quickly and we left them
1030ish
mid Haro Strait off Spieden in tidal slop. We last saw T14 parallel to the big group but way inshore near north Kellett.

Mallard's Report: Picked up the
T49A's and T36A's
westbound off of East Sooke Park at

1:50 p.m
. Left them at

2:50 p.m
. at 48° 19.55 N, 123° 44.48 W, moving quickly west against flood current.

Center for Whale Research report: At

7:30 a.m
., faint
transient
killer whale calls were heard on the Lime Kiln hydrophone, and at
7:52 a.m. approximately 15 killer whales were observed traveling north, line abreast, in Haro Strait off Bellevue Point. As they passed the Center for Whale Research at
8:20 a.m., T87, T124, T124A, and T88 were identified from the porch; and, at
8:55 a.m. "Orca Starlet" cast off from Snug Harbor to ascertain the remaining identifications. Almost immediately, at
8:58 a.m. we observed T14 by himself heading rapidly north off Mitchell Bay in Haro Strait toward the larger group of whales off Kellett Bluff. As the breeze picked up against the ebbing tide, the seas became rough, but we managed to approach the larger group and identify
T87, 88, 124, 124A, 124A1, 124A2, 124A3, 124D, 124E, 71, 71A, 71B, 71C?, 90, 90A
in a tight fast traveling group in mid-Haro Strait by the time they reached the turbulent eddies west of Speiden Channel. At

10:25 a.m
., we terminated the encounter for safety reasons because of rough water. Mark Malleson on Mount Young spotted another group of killer whales in a tight group off Bellevue Point as soon as we left the transients, so we responded via calmer waters in Mosquito Pass and ventured back out into the churning water to encounter
J pod
in Haro Strait in front of the Center for Whale Research. At

10:55
. We took proof of presence photos and left them heading toward Kelp reef at
11:05 a.m. Back at the Center for Whale Research, we heard T14 calls on the Orca Sound hydrophone and observed him on the SE side of D'Arcy Island at the same time that J pod was 1 mile SE of Kelp reef.
For a brief time, a few J pod calls were heard concurrent with the T calls.
Reports from the whale-watching fleet indicated that the T87 group continued north to Swanson Channel and through Active Pass by day's end; T14 remained behind them several miles traveling north off the west side of Pender Island; and J pod also continued north in Swanson Channel at last report. In the afternoon, Mark Malleson went west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and encountered seven additional transient killer whales heading west toward Sooke (see above report). They were T49A, 49A1, 49A2, 49B, 49B1, 36A, and 36A1. Mark took photographs of some very interesting fresh tooth rakes on the dorsal fin of T36A, suggesting that there may have been a very recent agonistic event of some kind.

Listening to hydrophones about
7:20 I began hearing 'strange' faint sounds. I was sure it wasn't J Pod calls, but I just didn't tune in to it being Transients, as I am not familiar with their calls. All of a sudden I saw blows coming straight up Haro Strait and less than a mile off shore! It was
Transients
! I guessed there were about a dozen of them and I got a pic of T-20, adult male who has a big rectangular notch on the upper portion of the trailing edge of his dorsal fin. I heard calls over a period of more than 2 hours - transients are usually more quiet I thought! Hearing the faint calls of the Ts moving off, I look up and there are more blows coming from the south! Then I saw Ruffles dorsal fin!
J Pod
seemed to be very quiet, grouped together as they moved north. Then I was fortunate to go on the Western Prince in the afternoon and see Pender T-14 for the first time! It seems that Pender had split off from the rest of the transients - who had moved off north. J Pod wasn't far away and they continued moving north.
