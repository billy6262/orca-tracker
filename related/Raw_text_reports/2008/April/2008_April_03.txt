I observed a
minke
whale between
0950-1030 Hrs
. The whale stayed in mid channel, north of Point Wilson feeding. Most likely on herring, working the area where the Rhinoceros Auklet, Pigeon Guillemot, Double- crested Cormorant and Glaucous-winged Gulls were also feeding. This behavior is typical of the Minke I have seen in Admiralty Inlet.
