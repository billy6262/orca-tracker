Orca Sightings for April 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
In rough seas, we were the last boat with
Transient
Orcas
T36A's & T49A's
and
T14
on Monday, west of Victoria, near Beecher Bay headed Southwest at
1230
hrs. This was the fourth day in a row that this group of Ts has been in the San Juan Island/Vitoria area. That's unusual. Also unusual is to see T14 "podding" like this. Could he have found a new "home"? Most of the time he is by himself, which from my human mind has always seemed more than a bit sad.

- First
gray
sighted, 1 mile NE of the Green Can buoy off the Southern point of Gedney Island. ID'd as #49 (patch). Patch was milling, doing very short shallow dives.

12:24 - We spotted another gray in the shallows of Tulalip. Too far in for ID.

12:45 - Our third whale sighted, actively feeding about .5 miles SE of the dolphin day marker. again no good ID shots.
