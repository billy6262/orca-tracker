Orca Sightings for April 27, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just wanted you to know that there is a
humpback
in Skunk Bay. It has been here most of the
afternoon
. Pretty sure it is the same one as yesterday. Passive early but seems to be more active right now. Mulling around - currently heading East.

My husband and I watched what might have been the same reported juvenile
humpback
in shallow water in Skunk Bay (Hansville- NW of Point No Point) casually staying on the surface for long periods of time. Later in the afternoon and early evening it was more active (feeding?) closer to the shipping lanes off Double Bluffs, a little south of Mutiny Bay. We never saw its fluke, but it appeared to roll, exposing large pectoral fines, and what looked like open jaws breaking the surface. In the deeper waters, the whale would dive for a minute or two, then surface, roll, double back as if making circles.

T14
accompanying
T36a's and T49a
's (I think). Animals were originally sighted at Salmon Bank marker approx

14:20
(by another whale watcher). I arrived at
14:55, .3 NM NNE of Northern Hein Bank marker. 6-7 Transient orca were traveling West-bound, zig-zagging to the North every so often. Witnessed harbour porpoise in the immediate area but no hunting behaviour. Animals turned northbound at approx.
15:55 appeared heading for Lime Kiln.

Saw two
grays
off of Clinton Sunday around

11:30am
. One appeared to have a cut on its back.

We saw several
grays
(6 or 7) in different directions. Three were south of Hat/Gedney Island, two were south east of Hat, towards Mukilteo, and at least one more even further south of the first three. I'm fairly positive we saw #21, #22 and #44, but photos were not clear enough to even try to identify the others.

Just got a call that
Pender (T-14)
and several other
transients
were cruising down near Salmon Bank (San Juan Island) around

2:30 PM
.

Here is a great photo of Pender, T14. If you look at the front base of his big male dorsal fin, you'll see some bumps. These are old scars left from a time when he had a transmitter bolted - yes, bolted - to the front of his dorsal fin. Somehow he or another Orca ripped it away from his body. This all happened over thirty years ago, but still make this one way to identify this
Transient
orca.

Heard that there are 3
minke
whales around the ODASS buoy in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
