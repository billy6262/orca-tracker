Orca Sightings for April 12, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I've attached two photos that I was able to take of the
minkes
. We were on the Kingston Ferry when we saw them and only had a quick chance to see them.

Just had dinner with the neighbors and several saw a
Minke
off Suquamish.
Jean Boyle, Director, Tourism Development, Kitsap Peninsula Visitor & Convention Bureau
Again, was this the minke that was sighted & photographed above, or was it the possible juvenile humpback sighted & photographed in Port Madison on Sunday?! sb

We found two
gray whales
swimming close together just north of Mukilteo heading toward Everett today at about

2:30pm
. They were #22 and #383. I attached a photo of #22 (above) for you. I also saw two whales from the ferry in Clinton at

8:30am
this morning heading south. We found one gray whale, at

11:45
just south of Jetty Island, that I was not able to identify.

We found 2
grays
between Everett and Hat Island - one looks to be #383 (see photo below), couldn't get a good photo of the 2nd whale.

On the Beach Watchers fundraising cruise we watched two
gray whales
, traveling closely together in the deeper water, from about
2pm to 3 pm
, down south in the Clinton, end of Gedney Island, near Everett area. Saw a lot of the two backs and flukes. One whale was definitely #383. There were only 2 whales, but they provided us with some great viewing.

A friend saw
greys
while sailing off Possession Point and said that they were heading north. So I drove over to Possession Beach State Park to watch them go by. There were a series of spouts but no dorsals, flukes or fins. There were glimpses of their backs. They were in mid channel between Possession Beach State Park and Mukilteo at

11:45AM
. They were slowly heading north. There was considerable boat traffic that was oblivious to them. The whales would disappear while the worst of the traffic passed and then surface behind them. I was able to watch them for about 15 minutes during which time they traveled less than a mile (guesstimate).

I have attached a picture of a whale I saw at
Noon
today while halibut fishing. This whale was seen north of Protection Island on the north end of Dallas Bank. The whale's presence coincided with a large school of baitfish. I suspect I've seen this lone whale before in this area and read reports of it of recent, but I would like to know if it is a false Killer Whale, a Pilot Whale, or ?. Locals that fish this area call this type of whale a "Black Fish". Jeff Dodd, Langley, WA
This whale is a Minke, & we may even have an ID on it soon from the NE Pacific Minke Whale Project, thanks to your great photo! I have heard locals call orcas, & sometimes pilot whales "blackfish", but have not heard this term applied to Minkes before - sb

Minke whale
spotted in Central Puget Sound, straight out from Discovery Park, near Seattle,
5 pm
. Whale was surfacing for an hour and heading South.

Orca Network received a call from Susan Thompson of
Shelter Cove, CA
, reporting a sighting of a pod of Orcas attacking and killing a Blue whale calf in Shelter Cove, N. Calif. She said she believed the whales are hanging around the Shelter Cove & Eureka, CA area.

I'm forwarding you a sighting I received via e-mail earlier this week. Sighting from Kerry Ross from Mad River Biologists in Eureka, CA: "I saw a small pod of 6 orca about 9-12 miles off the coast of the Eel River, Humboldt County, California on
April 12, 2008. I was aboard the Humboldt State University vessel the Coral Sea. I think I got images of all the animals but the male is most noticeable with a 'deformed' dorsal fin." I forwarded the pictures to Ken Balcomb, and he confirmed they are transients. He also gave some interesting information on the recent sightings of the distinct male. Turns out "this male is likely the one Greg Schorr got off Westport on 6/22/07 with fresh scarring; and, it is surely the one that Eric Martin got off Channel Islands (SoCal) on 3/11/2008 (last month!)."
Dawn Noren, NOAA Fisheries
Comments from Alisa Shulman Janiger on the
March 11th sighting of this same Transient: >From the first few photos available, I identified the distinctive adult male killer whale as CA217, a transient-type. This male has a damaged dorsal fin. When first photographed (
December 1998 - Santa Catalina Island, So. CA) the fin was injured at the base, flopped to the right and completely collapsed; necrotic tissue loss starting at the tip of the dorsal fin has reduced it over the years to a distinctive ragged stump. He has been photographed regularly in Monterey Bay since
February 1999. I also photographed him off the Los Angeles area in
January 2003. He was photographed in the Santa Barbara Channel several times, including
September 2006. He is usually photographed with the same four companions; at least one of those was with him yesterday and in
January 2003.
