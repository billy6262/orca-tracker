Orca Sightings for April 2, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
April 1 & 2 - We had that group of
Orcas
that were off of Catalina on the first of April, up here in the Santa Barbara Channel. The 2nd of April, there were confirmed at least 20, one large male, and two juvenile males with distinctively larger dorsals than their female counterparts. It was great, lots of mating behavior, they also beat up a Gray whale before we were there and let him go and continued westward on the southside of Anacapa Island, the Island and Vanguard (Island Packers) were on scene with them for quite some time.

out in Saratoga Passage on the West end of Langley, middle of the passage. They seem to be heading toward Langley, toward the East. They seem to be headed to the Dog House, and beyond.
