Orca Sightings for April 9, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

1:30 pm
: We were privileged to see three
gray whales
feeding in the waters between Mukilteo and Everett, about 1/4 mile from shore. We were on the Mystic Sea Charter Whale Watch Boat. An incredible sight! We watched for about 1/2 hour. Another brief sighting of one whale off the north coast of Gedney Island, about
1:00 pm.

I woke up this morning at

4:15 AM
and listened to the blows and splashing of at least two
gray whales
feeding in the shallow water NW of Langley. I listened to them for about half an hour.

We were in our hot tub about

12:10 am
& heard what sounded like 2
grays
blowing right off Hidden Beach/North Bluff, just north of Greenbank. We listened for about 20 minutes as they passed by heading south - almost as good as seeing them! Given the timing of the above report, it's likely these were the two whales that showed up off Langley in the wee hours as well.
