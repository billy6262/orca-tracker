Orca Sightings for April 14, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted this guy around
5 pm
. I saw him from our house just off Browns Point. I got 2 shots each time he surfaced. He did not stay up more than 5 to 7 seconds each time. Fortunately he did not swim far each time. Then just made a lazy surfacing and rolled back down. The first time he surfaced he was only 100 yards or less from me. He was close to shore and I got a good look from our 2nd floor. I could see about 20 feet of length but I never saw his head or tail. So I am guessing he could be 30 feet or more. He blew very loud and very high.

Cascadia Research replies after seeing the photos: Definitely a
gray whale
and could even be ID#53 based on the one white spot visible but there is no way to confirm this at this level of detail.

Orca Network received a call from Leland Jacobson, of
Astoria, OR
at

9:20 am
, reporting a pod of
orcas
(~2 males & 2 females) at the mouth of the Columbia River, going after a gray whale & her calf, 1/4 - 1/2 mile inside the jetty.

Will Elmquist called Orca Network at

10:50 am
, to report a whale approaching his boat while he was fishing west of Possession Pt, S. Whidbey Island. The whale came up to within 5' of the boat & looked right at him! He was in 50 - 60' of water, the whale had a pointed rostrum, he saw some white underneath it, & it was sort of rolling around. The whale was headed SW. At first we thought it was a Minke, as we'd had several reported in the area, but then when we got the report & photo above, of the possible juvenile humpback that also approached a boat yesterday - it is possible this could be the same whale.

Learned something new as a single
gray whale
was feeding off Mariner's Cove, south of Strawberry Point. First seen, at around

6:30 PM
and watched gray feed for next half hour, as it slowly made its way heading south; towards Polnell Point. What was surprising is it was at a low tide (1.0 at 7PM). Always thought feeding took place at a much higher tide.
