Orca Sightings for March 31, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Off of the Northeast tip of Vashon Island (Glen Acres) we saw a whale that I believe is a
Gray
. I have some pictures but the head of the whale is not in them. The head had a lot of the white mottling on it. It came up about 4 times in front each time going in a different direction and then I didn't see it anymore.

2
gray whales
just went by my house!!! Finally! They were heading slowly southward past Race Lagoon at

6:30 pm
. The air is so still, we could easily hear their blows, but were too far away to ID.

Orca Network received a call from Lisa Stockert reporting 2
gray whales
off the boat launch at Harrington Lagoon (SE of Penn Cove, Saratoga Passage), heading south at

6:05 pm
. She called several minutes later to say they had turned around & were heading north.
I have a feeling these two whales turned back south & are the two reported above by Jill Hein - sb

We were in Langley for a Welcome the Whales Day meeting with Langley Chamber president Fred Lundahl (MANY thanks to Fred & the Chamber for helping with the event!), & knew there were some whales in the neighborhood - so we finally caught up with them at

12:20 pm
,
2 grays
NW of Sandy Pt, feeding & slowly heading south. We went down to Sandy Pt, they swam & dove a bit, then stopped to feed some more as they rounded the point, continuing south very close to shore at about
12:45 pm. As we watched these two, we saw a 3rd spout WAY out over by the mainland shore north of Everett.

I saw two large spouts at

11:05 AM
apparently S-SE off Camano Head, viewing through binoculars from the bluff directly above the Langley marina looking toward the green buoy.

1030am
Bells Beach, 2
grays
cruising toward Langley, slowly. A boat with "POLICE" on the side spotted the grays coming toward them and they paused. The whales kept coming and the boat would move back, whales got closer, they'd alter course several times.

Whales are SMART! An interesting observation about

9:30 this morning
in Saratoga passage, mid-channel directly East of East Point; three
grays
then two more! FIVE all together rolling around, exchanging greetings blowing & puffing and then three moved off towards Langley (SE) and two moved down the channel towards you (NW toward Greenbank). As if they were knew that together they could overburden a feeding area. Too far away to recognize who they were - but fun to see them all grouped together!

Finally, my first sighting of the year. Four
gray whales
, one definitely smaller spout, feeding in the deep water south of Mabana, heading slowly south.

I live on South Camano Island looking West over Saratoga Passage almost directly across from Langley on Whidbey Island. This morning between
0800-0830
there were three
gray whales
circling around in front of my place about 500 yards offshore. I believe they were feeding and seemed to gradually move their circle North. One seemed exceptionally large and one seemed very small, the third I never got a close look at, I only saw the spout from that one. I have seen gray whales here about this time every year for some time. Best regards,
W. Tom Weeks, Camano Island
