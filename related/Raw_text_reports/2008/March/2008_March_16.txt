Orca Sightings for March 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I've been listening to and then watching at least two
gray whales
enjoy breakfast between Sandy Point and Langley this morning. They were there at

6:15 am
when I left for a walk and they're still out there now at

8:15 am
.
