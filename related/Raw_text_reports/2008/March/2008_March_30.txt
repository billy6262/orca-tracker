Orca Sightings for March 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw the spouts of approximately three [
gray
] whales - late
afternoon
in the middle of Admiralty Inlet just off Sandy Hook by Cultus Bay. I assume grays since several have been sighted by friends.

showed up at Kayak Point, in Port Susan. Moving north towards Warm Beach, close to shore .

We had 3
Grays
off Possession Pt. this afternoon at around
1pm
. Two were very close to each other about 1 mile SSW of the point, the other further away close to the buoy. Feeding and milling around for the duration of our stay with them. Unfortunately no ID shots.

A
grey whale
feeding just below Edgecliff Drive, Langley on my walk with Shadow this
morning
. Always a reliable spot to witness feeding when Greys are feasting in our local waters.
