Two big
Grays
are feeding in front of our place (East Pt. Saratoga Psg), then went out to mid-channel, turned around and came back in. They are putting on a great show - sounding with flukes high in the air, coming up to blow showing most of their backs and kicking up quite a storm as they have a breakfast of shrimp. They seem to be working their way toward the mouth of Holmes Harbor. Update at
