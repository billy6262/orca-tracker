Orca Sightings for March 22, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

10:00 a.m.
we sighted 3
gray whales
about 1 mile north of the Langley and about 200 yards off shore. They traveled slowly down the channel and came in close to Sandy Point where we spotted another whale closer to Hat Island. All four last seen headed towards Clinton.

At about

6:10 pm
I was on the ferry coming back to Clinton from Mukilteo. The announcement of "whales off the bow" came over the loud speaker and we took off like shots for the pickle fork. Sure enough, there were at least two [
grays
] heading toward Mukilteo and were exactly in between our ferry and the other one crossing at the same time. There were several double blows (two whales).
