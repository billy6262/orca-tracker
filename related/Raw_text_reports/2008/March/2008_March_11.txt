Orca Sightings for March 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had our first sighting of two
gray whales
feeding close to the shore, north Langley at

9:15 PM-
9:35 PM
. We watched them through a pair of night vision goggles and listened to them breathing. It was difficult to tell which direction they headed off in.
Veronica, Langley

Teresa Spratt called Orca Network to report 2
grays
had been sighted off Fox Spit/East Pt, Saratoga Passage late last week, & then this morning there were 3
grays
there at

8:45 am
, heading SE toward Langley. Then one of the grays turned back & stayed in front of their house feeding for 45 minutes!
