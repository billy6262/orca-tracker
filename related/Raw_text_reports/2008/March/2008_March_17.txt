Orca Sightings for March 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I did hear a few
grays
around
10 p.m
. - too dark to see them then.

Kim and I were lucky enough to be using a friend's hot tub just up the hill from Sandy Point on the Southeast of Whidbey, right across from the southern end of Camano Island. From about
9pm or 10pm
or so, we could hear
gray whales
blowing sporadically. We think they were feeding, because they stayed in the immediate area for some time, and we also think there were two or three because we could discern differences in the blows. One of the blows was more shallow and we wondered if this is the calf or young whale I've been reading is in the area. Around 10pm they started to move off the point toward the southeast, further out into the channel, and we left to go home and sleep. It was wonderful to hear them in the quiet night, and their sound carried wonderfully up the slopes of the island.
