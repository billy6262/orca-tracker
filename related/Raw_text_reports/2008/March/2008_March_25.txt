Report from the NOAA Ship McArthur II: Weather chased us in to the Straits of Juan de Fuca last Sat night so we waited there for a couple days rather than go home and it did pay off early Tues
AM
when we picked up
J pod
inbound off Neah Bay on the towed array. They turned NW near the Sekui River and we followed them over to near Port Renfrew and then west to Pachena Pt -
