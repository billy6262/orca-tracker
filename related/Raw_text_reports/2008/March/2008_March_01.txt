Orca Sightings for March 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I am happy to report a
Gray
this season! The sighting began at

14:20
right at Possession Pt, only about 200 yards SSE of the buoy. The whale was heading south, doing longer (timed 6- 8min) dives, most likely foraging on the shallower bank around Possession Pt. We stayed with it for a good 40 min, sighting ending at
14:43, travelling only about a mile south.
