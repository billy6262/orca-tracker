Orca Sightings for March 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ron Bates of the Marine Mammal Research Group in Victoria called to relay a report they got this afternoon of a large pod of
orcas
observed from a ferry in Active Pass this morning around
11 am
. The orcas were heading toward Georgia Strait.
*
Orca Network received a call from Ann, who is visiting the area & observed 3 whales from the Deception Pass Bridge at about 2 pm. She said they were west of the bridge, fairly close to shore. They didn't see any fins on the whales, they weren't moving in any direction, & there were a lot of gulls & birds flying around them. It sounds like it was likely several
grays
possibly feeding in the area. She said there was one small one & two adults.
*
Our first spout! At
1445
off Bells Beach (Saratoga Psg, just north of Langley) a
Gray
, out a bit, past the bouys by a fair bit. He seems to be generally heading toward Langley, but slowly. Skimming the surface, then diving for 10 min and then skimming. He's not going anywhere fast.
