Kelly Doran called to report sighting a whale off Salmon Beach near Tacoma at
10:30 pm Saturday night. They heard it spouting, & saw it heading south toward the Tacoma Narrows bridge. A dorsal fin was not observed.
It's possible this could have been a gray whale, but given the location & timing it is more likely it was the humpback whale that has been in this area - s&h

We got to see the
humpback
between the two ferry docks - pt defiance and Vashon. it was swinging its flukes and tail, and even did a spy hop. so darn cool!!
