Orca Sightings for June 9, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod
reported heading west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We still saw a variety of wildlife; beginning at noon, a California sea lion right in Friday Harbor, then at least 12 bald eagles, harbor seals, and a river otter along the shore on Spieden Island. A nice view of a dozen? or more Dall's porpoise at Turn Point, Stewart Island, then a parade of a large pod of harbor porpoise.

I received a report from Ivan on Western Prince that the little
humpback
is still around the San Juans. He/she was sighted off Yellow Island in San Juan Channel in the morning and off Stuart Island in the afternoon.

I caught sight (on the Race Rocks webcam) of a couple of
Orcas
passing very quickly in calm water on the south side of Race Rocks this morning at

6:05 am
. They seemed to be travelling towards Vancouver Island but I lost sight of them after only a couple of seconds.

There was a group (4-8 people at different times) of us watching the
humpback
whale at Pt. Defiance earlier today, from about
11am to 2pm
. It was circling at its usual spot then disappeared down the Narrows for at least 20 minutes. We got several good looks at its back but nothing else, wasn't too active. After reappearing near Pt. Dalco and coming back towards us. It then breached completely out of the water 3 times in a row heading towards Owens Beach. After that it spy hopped and held its fluke up in the air a couple times before disappearing again. The only photos taken showed the back and splashes, nothing that could identify it. I'll be back on the 5 mile drive tomorrow trying for a better shot and maybe some video.

Whale off of Turn Point, Stuart Island.
