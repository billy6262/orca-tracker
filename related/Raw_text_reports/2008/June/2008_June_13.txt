Orca Sightings for June 13, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
About 6
Dall's porpoises
passed by Langley headed to the Southeast. When I first spotted them they were traveling right along the drop off, where the eel grass is, possibly hunting for fish? I have never seen them so close to shore and also with the tide so low. The porpoises then headed off into deeper water but continued to the SE.

L pod
returns to join
J pod
traveling north through Haro Strait. Astrid van Ginneken, Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, and Stewart Macyntire of the Center for whale Research responded to a call that
L pod
and possibly
K pod
are traveling with
J pod
east from Beaumont Shoal toward the west side of San Juan Island. The Center arrives on scene at

3:15 p.m.
(48째 28.990 N; 123째 07.665 W) and confirms that some members of
L pod
are present along with all of
J pod
.
No members of K pod
were sighted. After milling off of Pile Point the whales grouped up and traveled North. The Center staff followed them up to Stuart Island. The encounter ended at
7:00 p.m, at 48째 40.190 N; 123째 13.760 W. The L 9 sub group, L 54 subgroup, L 2 subgroup, L 22 subgroup and L 12 were not seen or documented.

It wasn't a superpod, but it was spectacular. The
Js
and many of the
Ls
came together yesterday afternoon in the big waves off of Hannah Hts., and acted like a superpod. Jumping, rolling, spyhopping, the whole nine yards! And then, right out in front of Snug Harbor, our dock, the amazing views continued for our

5:00 PM
trip. I haven't seen so much porpoising in unison for years. Five and six at a time. Big wows from everyone on the boat, including me. We followed them all the way to Turn Pt. on Stuart Is. where they all passed between us and the cliffs and the light house and Mt. Baker. The sounds were amazing as we sat there with the engines off. Long after we could see them the sound of their blows came floating back to us over the calm waters.

Capt. Jim Maya called Orca Network to report on what sounded like a WONDERFUL day on the water with
J pod
and parts of
L pod
! He said they were very active, lots of breaching and mating behavoir. He left them at

7:30 pm
, at Turn Pt, heading north up Swanson Channel.

Orcas
moving slowly northbound. No social calls -- Lots of echolocation clicks. Orcas close to shore as are commercial boats.

Orca
whales have been here just south of Lime Kiln Lighthouse for over an hour, (
7 to 8 AM
) on the west side of San Juan Island. I imagine J-pod. About six or more coming by now going north.

9:20 AM
. My guests saw the baby with the earlier group.

Reports of
J pod
west side of San Juan Island heading north, at
noon
. The folks on land all the way up to LimeKiln Point State Park got a great view! Wait, they turned & started heading south, so we headed down San Juan Channel, through Cattle Pass, to find them spread out from Hannah Heights to Hien Bank & beyond. A bit bumpy out there with the wind & fairly strong flood tide. We saw some breaches in the distance & were able to ID, through binoculars, first J-30 Riptide, who did some long dives. Right behind him popped up his mom- J-14 Samich with his sisters, J-37 Hy'Shqa & J-40 Suttles sticking close to J-14. J-37 did back to back breaches & little J-40 followed with her own breaches! They had been traveling somewhat easterly, near shore & then they turned rather abruptly south & west as if to catch up with the rest of the pod. I was wondering to myself why the pod would be going against the flood tide, when they had been riding it up earlier in the day, when we got the report that
L pod
was heading in from the west! When we left at
2pm
, J pod was heading west, perhaps to meet up with L pod? And of course we are hoping that K pod is right behind them!

Don't get too excited but my Dad just called and thought he saw a couple of
orcas
from the Bainbridge/Seattle ferry- right off the ferry dock (

8:30 am
- ish). I suspect they might have been
porpoises
but I guess you never know!
