I just got back from whale watching on Mystic Sea tours out of Anacortes and saw
ALL 3 pods
up in Canadian waters near Vancouver.

4+
orca
sighted at N 48° 53' 35.30" W 122° 59' 26.08" (off Boundary Bay, upper Rosario Strait), traveling south,
1300- 1320
, including an adult male.

This location is near where the reports of J, K & L pods were on the 22nd, so these whales were likely Southern Residents - S & H
*
J, K and L pods
passing Lighthouse Marine Park in Point Roberts. The first group starting passing at
1115
and the second group were following about one hour later. The second group was the most active when close to shore that I have seen in many years. Multiple breaches, head views, tail fluke slaps and other social behaviours. The land based adventure lasted two hours.

We had a rough trip to Birch Bay and saw some of
all 3 pods
, very rough and difficult to ID, but lots of whales again, quite a few breaches, spyhops and tailslaps. They appeared to be heading towards the shore, and south towards Lummi.

between rocky point on camano and polnell pt on whibey at

6:00 pm
. It blew once then sounded.

I just wanted to tell you that the same (
gray
) whale has been hanging around now for the last week. Coming in and feeding in the evenings for long stretches and we have heard him off and on through the night and into the early morning! It has truly been an amazing treat and we have whale holes galore here now. We are on Saratoga Passage facing the backside of Hat Island and the lights of Everett.
