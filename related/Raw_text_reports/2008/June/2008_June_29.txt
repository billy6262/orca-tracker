Orca Sightings for June 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm aboard the Island Explorer 3 headed toward Victoria. We saw
Polaris, Granny with Ruffles, K-Pod mom with her baby
, an unidentfiable very large male and many others. It was difficult to make any ID's with the glare of the sun but I estimate there were about 22 or more. They were coming at us from all sides.

Dave Ash called Orca Network to report a pod of 5
orcas
, including 1 adult male, 3 females and 2 calves at 1 pm, off
Tatoosh Island, WA
Coast. The whales were milling between Tatoosh and the mainland, and heading east.
*
Grant Allen called Orca Network to report 2
orcas
west of Clallam, at
11 am
, heading west 1/2 mile offshore.
*
The Kittiwake encountered a
Minke
Whale, the smallest of the fin whales, a
Humpback
Whale, and the
Transient Orca T14
. The Sea Lion trip had some playful Dall's Porpoises on our first trip who used our boat for "target practice" as they zigged and zagged around the Sea Lion. We even saw a Dall's jump clear out of the water, something I've never seen before. Our sunset trip allowed us to see Transient orca T14. T14 is a pretty famous Transient as he helped to put an end to live captures in the United States.

Reports of
all three pods
coming in from Race Rocks at about

6:30 pm
on
June 29th. At

9:30 pm
that night, just as the light was fading I glimpsed a whale diving about 1/4 mile off Hannah Heights, then nothing for about 15 minutes. After that I began hearing a small number of blows but could see nothing. Finally I located J26 foraging about a hundred yards offshore and saw several smaller fins. The whales all appeared to be foraging, but the light was getting dimmer and it was difficult to see. There did not appear to be many whales in the group, and I couldn't see any blows farther off. The last I saw anything was J26 taking about 4 short dives in a southerly direction at about 10pm. At that time I had not heard any blows for about 10 minutes, except from J26.
