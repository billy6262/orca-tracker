Orca Sightings for June 20, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

2:30pm to
3:30pm
, many members of
J-Pod
in tight formation, resting, as they crossed Open Bay, northwest San Juan Island, heading north, strong flood tide just starting to pick up. In my years of observation, I have seen the most resting behavior in this area. They woke up, broke up into smaller groups & became active with breaches, percussive behaviors, body rolls, and some kelp draping again. J-1 Ruffles with L-57 Faith, close behind, brought up the rear.

At
1730
I was traveling north at location 47 11.075N 124 39.132W (about 20 miles west of
Pacific Beach WA
) making 7 knots off the coast of Washington when I sighted four
Orcas
traveling west. I could not tell male from female and could see no markings but one looked noticeably smaller than the other three. They passed astern and disappeared.

J Pod
- Pender Island - between

4:15pm and 5pm
, we counted 14-18
Orcas
pass Thieves Bay, Pender Island, heading north through Swanson Channel. The three leaders travelled by slowly, approximately 1 NM ahead of the rest of the group. The next two, slightly in front of the balance of this group rolled onto their sides several times. We thought they might be mating. Photo ID's included: J1, J2, J11, J16, J28, J30, J33, J34, J35, J39, J42 and L57. Lots of tail slaps and several spyhops. The trailers were very close to shore, within 10 metres. We counted 22 private and whale watch boats observing these whales.

Around

8:30 pm
or so a
gray whale
came by feeding up and down the coast north of the ferry dock past Witter Beach (SE Whidey Island). He was around for quite a while and came back periodically throughout the night.

Went over towards the northwest side of San Juan Island to meet up with the
J-Pod
of Orcas that have returned from their venture out to sea for the last 2 days. The
orcas
were moving very slowly the whole afternoon - a few of the "leaders" of the pod were about a mile ahead while the rest of the pod was in a tight group all surfacing within seconds of each other to breathe.
J-1
(Ruffles) was among this group! I love that big guy! Very cool to see them in this relaxed state. It seemed as though a few awoke because we saw a few calves breaching, as if to say "Mom, wake up, wake up!". We also noticed that L-57 (Faith) is still hanging out with the J-Pod - perhaps looking for a mate - spending some time alongside J-28 (Polaris).
