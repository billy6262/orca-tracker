This morning we had
J-Pod
nice and close at Cattle Pass. They were spread out. As "usual", the whales were in a bit of a hurry to cross the entrance and then slow down once past. We found a nice group of 3 trailers about 2-3 miles behind the other whales, so we settled in to watch this small group. They were moving slowly up island until---they discovered salmon! They began lunging around and around, putting up nice sprays with their dorsal fins. We knew they had caught some fish as they surfaced, the wind brought over the distinct aroma of fresh salmon sushi! For our afternoon trip, the whales were making a south and westerly movement, so we didn't see the whales again until we got out past Hein Bank. Once again, the whales were very spread out over several miles, and the water began to get a bit choppy. But we did get to see two nice groupings of whales, one of which had J16, J33, and little J42 traveling together (big brother J26 was hanging out further away with J27). The best part of the trip was getting to see J42 traveling so tucked in by mom, but the bigger waves meant she kept popping her chin out of the water! (see photo) Later that evening, whales were reported way out west, but slowly heading back in (of course, now that I'm typing this on the next day, we know they went out west this Monday morning).
