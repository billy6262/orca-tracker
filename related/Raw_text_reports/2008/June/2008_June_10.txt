Orca Sightings for June 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today began with no confirmed
orca
reports and rumors that
J Pod
was hanging out closer to the Pacific Ocean. We received a report of a group of
Transient
Orcas hanging out near Iceberg (Lopez Island) and heading northwest towards us. We scooted down the west side of San Juan Island, after getting a quick look at the Mouflon Sheep on Speiden, in pursuit of the Transients. We arrived on scene just south of Cattle Point to see four Transient orcas: one mature male, two females, and a calf. The group was later identified as the T30s being the mother T30 and her three offspring: T30A (the bull), T30B (the other cow), and the calf T30C. They were swimming around pretty eratically; changing direction, grouping up, and splitting apart in no predictable fashion. They were swimming at about 4mph and were surfacing in intervals of about 7 minutes. We observed the Transients for about 1/3 of our trip.

Glanced out our window about
7 PM
and was surprised to see the spout of a
gray whale
feeding on the ghost shrimp flats off Mabana Road (west Camano Island). This is the latest in the season I've seen grays. Even more surprising was that the boat that hydralically harvests ghost shrimp in the area had just left the same area!

orcas

, about 400' offshore, heading west toward the entrance to Hood Canal. They were 2 miles west of the Lighthouse, at 47 55N 122 34W.
