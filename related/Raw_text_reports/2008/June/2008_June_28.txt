I'm almost certain I saw an
Orca
about

11:30am
in Sinclair Inlet at Bremerton, Washington, near the Manette Bridge. It was headed from the interior of the inlet toward Puget Sound. I realize that's an unlikely spot, but I understand there was a pod of Orcas in this inlet a couple of years ago. When I saw it, I was "positive" it was an Orca, but I'm new to this area and have never seen an Orca anywhere before as a comparison. So I visited your web site to research what I saw. I'm still fairly certain it was an Orca, and I wanted to report it to you as a possible sighting. I was about 50 to 100 feet away from it (I live on the water). It was sleek and black, and I could see the typical white markings as it surfaced and "blew." It was probably 20+ feet long, and the spray from its blow was maybe six to eight feet high. It surfaced several times (moving maybe 50 feet farther away each time) in a graceful "dolphin like" motion, and it blew each time it surfaced. It had a dorsal fin that looked like some of the photos on your web site, although perhaps a bit more rounded and not quite as "spikey" as some of them.

We were at The Boat Shed Restaurant at
11AM
when a single adult
grey whale
sighting by a neighbor was reported. We went out to the deck and sure enough - within 2 minutes, it surfaced three times. It had just passed under the Manette Bridge and was heading North towards the Sound (Sinclair Inlet?).

We had the privilege of seeing the whale off the Bainbridge ferry. What a magnificent sight. I too am hoping someone on the ferry has a picture.
