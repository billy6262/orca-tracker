Orca Sightings for June 2, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We left
J Pod
slowing working their way south about 1.5 miles south of Matia Is., just north of Orcas Is, this evening at
1930
hrs,
7:30PM landlubber time. They spent the day working into a large flood and the ebb was kicking in so that they should be moving down toward San Juan Is.

Today we had the good fortune of having
J-Pod
right at Cattle Pass, which meant a very short trip for us! Knowing that the J's tend to porpoise their way across the entrance to Cattle Pass, we waited off shore for them to slow down. The sun came out just in time for J27 Blackberry to make a very slow pass. The whales seemed almost leisurely in their pace once past the pass, and we were not prepared for the display to come. As we were telling the passengers that our time with the whales was coming to an end, we saw a group of four orcas passing about 150 yards to our stern. Then WOOSH (ok, that wasn't the actual sound we heard but a little creative writing to paint the picture)--a huge breach! Followed 30 seconds later by a 2nd, then a 3rd, 4th, and 5th breach. It was amazing to hear the huge slap on the water as this gravity-defying whale leaped repeatedly with apparent abandon. A perfect ending to the day. Later in the evening (approximately
8:30PM), the trailers were passing mid-Haro channel heading northward.

The
humpback
was spotted off of Pt Richmond Beach (Gig Harbor) mid channel, on Colvos Passage at

7:35 am
. Whale was drifting north just playing around.

We've been watching a
gray
off Race Lagoon for over 30 minutes, since

8:30 am
. Saw his dorsal a couple of times, but too far away to ID (If I had to guess, I'd say Dubnuk, simply because of the barnacle patch in front of the blowhole - but still no photo). He was feeding fairly close to shore, going back and forth and then seemed to disappear when a crab boat came by. Difficult to say what direction he was heading.

Sandy Poust of the Windjammer Gallery in Coupeville called Orca Network at

11:40 am
to report a
gray
whale in Penn Cove, near the wharf heading east.
*
At approximately

11:50 AM
, spouts were seen near the Coupeville, WA dock in Penn Cove, east side of Whidbey Island. Believed to be a
gray whale
.
