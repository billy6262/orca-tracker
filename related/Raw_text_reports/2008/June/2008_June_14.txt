Our
AM
trip took us to south Rosario Strait off Lopez Island to view members of
L pod
. The whales were bucking the tide as they moved past at about 5-6 knots, in small groups. The groups were spread out over almost the entire Strait, and heading south when we left them at about noon. On our afternoon trip, we were fortunate to join up with members of
J Pod
near Lummi Rocks. The J Pod whales were spread out over the entire area, moving slowly and randomly over miles of glassy calm waters. They didn't seem to be going anywhere at the time, just milling in the area and enjoying a relaxing Saturday afternoon in "the pool". There were no vocals, and the whales were all doing their own thing, even the calves. We had one pass-by of little
J42
, all by her lonesome. She spyhopped a few times, then swam slowly along the south Lummi Island shoreline, sometimes circling, sometimes on her back with her tiny pec flippers in the air and her tail flukes paddling on the surface. It reminded us all of a child swimming confidently in a pool without Mom hovering anxiously beside. Brothers J26 and J33 were in the vicinity, but not nearby. We left the whales at approximately

17:30
, and they were still circling around off the west side of Lummi Island.

J's and L's
milling off the west side of San Juan Island. Astrid van Ginneken, Dave Ellifrit, and Stuart Macyntire of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J and L pod
at

1:15 p.m.
off South Beach at the southern end of San Juan Island (48째 26.720 N; 123째 01.39 W). L26, L90 and L92 were milling close to the Center boat.
L92
(male born 1995) caught a fish and was pushing it around with his rostrum for several minutes. The whales were very spread out and aparently foraging. After a few hours, small sub groups began traveling north. The Encounter ended at

3:47 p.m
. Just off shore of Lime Kiln Sate Park (48째 30.73 N; 123째 09.84 W), where the whales turned around and started moving south.

We saw 2 adult
orcas
and a smaller whale off of the Skunk Bay Light (5844 NE Twins Spits Rd Hansville, WA) at

19:30
. They were staying in one general area while we watched so we wouldn't be able to tell you which way they were going.

I am quite certain we saw a
humpback
whale in the evening. The time would have been about

5:30 PM
. It was definitely a whale and it was not a gray and it was not an orca. We were watching from Mukilteo. The whale was alone and was heading from south Whidbey north toward Clinton closer to Whidbey Island shoreline. We watched it spout several times as it moved and we saw its back roll out of the water.

8:25 AM
- about six
Dall's porpoises
came by again, northwest of Langley, heading to the northwest. Doing the same behavior, traveling right along the drop off where the eel grass is. They're moving right along. I watched them for about 10 minutes before they were out of sight.
