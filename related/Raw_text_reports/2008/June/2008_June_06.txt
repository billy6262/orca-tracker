Orca Sightings for June 6, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Well the weekend was off to a fast start with
orcas
passing Point Roberts at
1207
Heading South.
J pod
was in small groups and spread out over a few miles. The last ones past the park at 1250. Many of them, including J1 Ruffles was very close to shore most likely looking for food as J pod does. They were travelling for the most part but some heads can be seen as they moved along. At
1350
they were still nearby at approximately 2 miles off the Lilly Point reef marker. In the evening they were heading into Rosario Strait.

Orcas
(J pod +?) spread out for miles passing by Lummi Island on their way south from

6:30 on until after 8 p.m
. They spent some time circling and lunging in the rips north of Village Pt. with a couple of toddler breaches to add to the excitement.

We had to travel quite a distance to find the whales south of Point Roberts, however, the time it took to get there was worth the trip. After our journey out, we found
J Pod
traveling towards the Rosario Strait. For much of viewing, we traveled alongside J26, Mike. Mike was much more easy to distinguish because of his large dorsal fin. While cruising back to harbor, a few guests spotted harbor porpoises swimming along.

We had a fantastic day watching
J-pod
just south of Point Roberts around

2:45pm
. J-pod was breaching like crazy all over the place. It looked like almost every member of J-pod must have breached at least once or twice all the way from the little ones up to the old timers. Ruffles (J1) breached several times, and even Granny (J2) made a full breach (see photograph above of her breach landing). Blackberry (J27) was really showing off with multiple breaches and cartwheels. They were breaching the entire time we spent watching them. We must have seen 75 breaches or more if you count all the half and quarter breaches. I've been out here for 8 years now and I was so excited that I was shaking. It was just awesome to see J-pod having such a great time, and to be able to share it with passengers that might never see another orca in their lifetimes! They will be orca fans for the rest of their lives.
