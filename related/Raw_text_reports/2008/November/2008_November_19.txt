Orca Sightings for November 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky to be out this afternoon in POW Zodiac. We were hoping to see some of the Residents that went out west yesterday. Sure enough we suddenly saw
Ruffles
. It wasn't till after a visit to Race Rocks that we finally saw a few more members of J pod. J 30 and J 33 heading toward Trail Island. There were several other females spread across the Strait.

Cathy Bacon called Orca Network at

8:50 am
to report she was hearing
orca
calls on OrcaSound's Port Townsend hydrophones. We listened in after receiving the call, but must have missed them. We were headed to the Kitsap Peninsula to do a presentation, so looked for whales from the Whidbey-Pt. Townsend ferry from

10:15 -
10:45 am
. Twice I saw something that COULD have been an orca blow (the 2nd time I thought I saw a dorsal fin with the blow, but it was too distant to confirm). Then we received a call from Chris Dunagan of the Kitsap Sun late this afternoon that he had received reports of two possible single orca sightings - 1 orca sighted at
11:48 am near Illahee at the Brownsville Marina, the other was a single orca in the Port Orchard area at 2 pm. We were still in the area so scouted around a bit, but the light was fading. So given all these clues, we think there may have been 1 or 2 Transient orcas in Puget Sound today.
