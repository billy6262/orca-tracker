Orca Sightings for November 9, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1445
hrs., 3.6 nm Southwest of
Constance Bank
, we arrived on scene with a single
Humpback
whale. The boats on scene, Peregrine and Cetacean, had told me that the animal was one of the juveniles not on our Humpback I.D. Catalog. The whale was one of the "Y" Humpbacks (had white tips on the flukes) and during our stay, it circled a specific area which was loaded full of Gulls, Rhinoceros Auklets and Common Murres. For 30 minutes the Humpback lunged through the giant bait ball always staying within 200- 300 yards of our location.

Here are
a few pics
of the amazing behaviours of these
Transients
chasing the little Ancient Murrelets. We even saw some of the whales spit these little guys out in a fountain of water.

We headed West to
Race Rocks
to find the T-46B's and the T-124's. The
Transients
were all grouped up and headed West right along the shoreline at Christopher Pt. (1nm West of Race Rocks). We spent about 25 minutes following this group to the West. They were high-speed lunging, with lots of dolphin leaps, obviously trying to capture something? Twice during our stay we saw two separate animals come up for air and we could see what looked like a Harbour Seal in their jaws. At
1610
hrs. we entered Becher Bay with this group at which point I noticed another group of Orcas to the Southwest of our location. We ventured over to the other group to find the T-100's swimming North directly into Becher Bay probably to join up with the other group. These three Transients pods made quite a wrecking crew. At 1630 hrs. our encounter ended with all the animals together (T-46B's, T-100's and the T-124's) right at Beechey Hd. still headed West right along the shoreline.

It was an incredible encounter with at least 7, possibly 9
Transient killer whales
off
Albert Head
. Orca every which way you turned. They were so very active chasing after and playing with tiny Ancient Murrelets all around us. Several of these tiny seabirds were floating on the surface and not consumed. Hard to understand this kind of behaviour. They must have made a big kill earlier before we arrived, for they were quite vocal on the surface. Definitely, this 5yr old Transient can be ID as T46B1. Its unique spider -web markings on its saddle patch makes it easy to ID, so one can assume the rest of the T46's were among these animals seen today.
