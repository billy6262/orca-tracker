Orca Sightings for November 24, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We are now able to report which whales were seen off
Alert Bay BC
. The DFO has confirmed that it was part of the
Ls
. This is only the 2nd time that we know of that southern residents have chosen to head north in the late Fall via Johnstone Strait. Two years ago, southern residents came through in early December. At that time, it was dark so pictures were not possible. However, they were vocal. This time, we don't believe they were vocal while in range of our hydrophones but Paul was fortunate to be in town at the time they passed by and was able to take a few pictures.
L85, L41, L77, L78, L79 and L25
were identified from the pictures. Thanks to Jared and Graeme for their help with the identifications. Last night we had northern residents turn up in Johnstone Strait. They had been absent since Nov.3rd. This morning, we have been watching 4 humpbacks wandering back and forth feeding.

My
2:00 trip this afternoon was the only whale watching boat out on the ocean today - It proved to be an absolutely magical trip as we picked up
all 3 Resident pods (J,K&L)
3 nm South of the Victoria Harbour. The conditions on the water were perfect as it was flat calm with little to no wind. We had clear skies with a brilliant sunset at the end of the tour at
Race Rocks
with the Olympics in the backdrop. Ron Bates (MMRG) was the "Man of the Hour" as he was the person who spotted the Orcas from shore and was able to direct me by cell phone and binoculars to the right location. At

2:25 pm
we arrived on scene approx. 1nm West of the VH buoy. The first whales we spotted were J-30, J-14, 37 & 40. At this point the animals were very spread out (foraging) traveling slowly to the West. The vocals were superb as their were no other vessels anywhere around us. J-40 was fishing with her mom (J-14) and the little one (J- 40) kept showing off her catch by spyhopping with the intact salmon in her mouth. We saw this behaviour 3-4 times in about 5 minutes. We left the J-14's and ventured further South as we could see more animals in the distance. Upon arrival, we encountered K-13, K-20 and her calf K-38. These animals were not foraging and seemed to be grouping up with other animals from the South, which I assumed to be the rest of the K's. At this point, Ron Bates phoned me and told me that he could see quite a few large males far to the Southeast of my location, right next to the Coho Car Ferry which was coming from Port Angeles. At this point I felt like I was on a treasure hunt - So I continued Southeast to see who else we could find and as we approached this next group we found the rest of J-Pod and L-pod. We noticed that J- 1 and J-2 were swimming with L-7, L-53 and L-57. These animals were travelling Northeast towards Trial Island with purpose at about 7.5 kts. As we followed this group to the Northeast we noticed that all the whales seemed to be converging together at or near the West side of Constance Bank. For a final set we positioned far to the East to get a look at the lead animals. We found the lead whales to be between Constance Bank and Clover Point and I.D.'s were found to be K-11, K-40, K-21, K-22, K-33 and Lea's group (the K-14's). Our encounter ended at

4:04 pm
1.8 nm Southeast of Clover Point as the whales continued Northeast towards Trial Island.

Beautiful views at
Lime Kiln
. We did see about a dozen Dall's Porpoise fairly close to shore.

Ron Bates of MMRG in Victoria called at
3 pm
to relay the ecstatic news that he had just sighted a
superpod
from the
Victoria
waterfront! Seafun had a boat out and so far had ID'd J & K pods, with more whales (including lots of males) to the south, so likely L pod present as well. They were spread out, and unfortunately heading SW toward Race Rocks.

Jeff LaMarche of Seafun Safaris called at

3:45 pm
with an update on the superpod - the whales had turned around, now heading NE toward
Trial Island
and San Juan Island at a fast pace. All 3 pods are confirmed to be present.
