Orca Sightings for November 3, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1455
hrs. we approached the area just South of Constance Bank. We heard reports from "Radar" and "Jim Maya" that they had a single Humpback and several Transients (see Transient report continued below) in the vicinity. Arriving at 2.2 nm South of
Constance Bank
, we stopped well over 250 yards away from Peregrine (Jim Maya's vessel) and sat with engines off for a few minutes as I introduced Humpback Whales to my passengers. About 4 minutes after being completely shut down, the single juvenile
Humpback
came up right along the port side of our vessel and swam at the surface as it inspected our boat for what seemed like a few minutes. The whale swam clockwise around us while at the surface the entire time. As the Humpback came to the starboard side it submerged and then came straight up out of the water doing a full spyhop literally 5 feet away from me. Absolutely incredible to see from this distance !!!! After this close encounter, the whale continued on its way to the Northeast and started a deep diving sequence.
At this point we headed 1 nm to the Southeast to view a group of 5
Transients
which "Saltchuck" from Prince of Whales was viewing. The 5
Orcas
were doing long dives and being quite elusive. No I.D.'s were made on this group as we were viewing them from quite a great distance (300 yards+) We had noticed lots of seals in the area, therefore, I'm guessing the whales were actively hunting as I heard no sounds on the hydrophone and they were swimming very fast. For 45 minutes, the 5 animals circled the area just to the Southeast of Constance Bank looking for dinner. We left the area at 1600 hrs. and continued West to Race Rocks.
