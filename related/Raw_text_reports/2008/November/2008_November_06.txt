Orca Sightings for November 6, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving a call about [
orcas
] off
Marrowstone Island
just before
noon
on Thursday, we headed over to the west shore of Whidbey to try to find them. We arrived at Lagoon Pt at
12:30, and spotted the orcas spread out between Ft. Flagler, Marrowstone Island, and Lagoon Pt, Whidbey Island, heading south. Most were mid-channel, so difficult to ID, but as we watched them pass Lagoon Pt. between

12:30 and
1:10 pm
, we estimated as many as 40-50 whales, with maybe 8-10 adult males. We observed several breaches and tail lobs, but they were mostly in traveling mode, not a lot of foraging going on. We drove down to Bush Pt. and watched them pass by between
1:20 pm and
2:40 pm. They came in a bit closer to the Whidbey side, and we were able to get a few ID shots, confirming J pod with at least some L pod whales. They did a little more foraging off Bush Pt, but mainly continued their way south, and we stopped watching at
2:40 pm as they spread out between the entrance to Hood Canal and Bush Pt, still heading south.
