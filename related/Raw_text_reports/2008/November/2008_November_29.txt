Orca Sightings for November 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I paused just south of
Discovery Is
. to take a look with the binocs, and there they were. We got to see
J Pod
today, just south of Victoria. We left them headed Southwest at

3:30
this afternoon.

I woke up this morning listening to
J-pod
on the
Salish Sea Hydrophone Network
. I believe the whales, at this point, were Southbound in Andrew's Bay near Ken's place. My tour left the harbour at
1:30 this afternoon and approx. 30 minutes later we arrived on scene 2nm Southeast of Clover Point (Victoria Waterfront) with a very spread out J-pod which were heading Southwest towards
Race Rocks
. We had great vocals this afternoon and were treated to a very close spy hop with J27 (Blackberry). Talking to Capt. Jim and Radar, all J-pod whales were accounted for except J-1 (Ruffles) and J-2 (Granny), however, I'm sure they were out there somewhere. The conditions today were not ideal, foggy and rainy, with the whales spread over many miles North/South. Positive I.D.'s were J8, all the J14's, J27, 31, 39, J17, 28, 35, and the J16's. On my way home from Race Rocks at
4:15 (sunset) we passed by the animals which were now 2 nm Southeast of Albert Hd. still heading out.
