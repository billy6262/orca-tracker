Orca Sightings for November 25, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
It is

7:07am PST
and I am hearing
Orca
on the
Orcasound Hydrophone
. There is a lot of clicking going on at the time. Calls are faint. It is now
7:30 am PST and I am hearing a lot of calls, specifically J Pod. Extremely loud calls at this time. It is
8:23 am PST and the Orca calls are getting very faint. They must be heading North as I never heard them on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. I am still hearing the calls, not as numerous as before, but they are still in the area. It is still J-Pod that I am hearing.

Began hearing very faint

Lime Kiln
at ~

. Based on this sequence of (mostly S1 and S16) and the sequence at Orcasound, Js and Ks were heading south.

10:03:
Hearing frequent, very faint S1 and S16 calls again over a very quiet background. Maybe they're turning and coming north again with the flood tide? (It's nearly slack now.)
