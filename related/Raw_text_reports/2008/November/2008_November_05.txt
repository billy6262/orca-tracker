Orca Sightings for November 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I have been working on a new home at
Bush Pt Whidbey
Island. At about
2 pm
at least 30
orcas
were in the area. They were spread out over a large area and heading south. There seemed to be a few big males and lots of females and smaller ones. We watched them for quite some time, they seemed to be feeding or looking for food. I have been working here since the 1st of Nov. and this is the third time that I have seen them.

Orca Network received a call from Carol Roan-Dennis of
Bush Pt
, west Whidbey Island, reporting 2 orcas at around

12:30 pm
just north of Bush Pt. They were at quite a distance so could not definitely confirm they were orcas. We went out this afternoon after the call and looked for whales off Bush Pt., but only saw 1 porpoise.
