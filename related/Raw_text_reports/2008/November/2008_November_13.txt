Orca Sightings for November 13, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:00 AM Humpbacks
sighted
Western Puget Sound
in the vicinity of Port Madison and Indianola heading North toward Kingston. Believe to have seen two to three animals, at least one of them was very active jumping out of the water. Our vantage point was from several miles away so no further details.
