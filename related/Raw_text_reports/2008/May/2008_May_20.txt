Orca Sightings for May 20, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
More on
Trinidad, CA Transient orcas
: I spoke with Mark and he said there were about 6-7 orca that he saw. The other images that he sent me are also of a poor quality so they are not going to help. He did describe one of the 2 males as having a "large chuck" out of the dorsal fin that left behind some light scarring. Sorry there isn't more detail.

Orca Network received a call from a reporter for the Eureka (CA) Times Standard about an
orca
that charged up on a beach and grabbed a harbor seal. Half of the whale's body was out of the water. The whale then tossed the seal away and slid back into the water. At least 3 juvenile orcas were nearby. Was it all a hunting lesson for the young ones? He said there were some reports of a larger group of orcas further offshore. Orcas are known to beach themselves to catch sea lions in Patagonia, Argentina and in the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean, but this is believed to be the first report of an orca grabbing a seal off a beach in North America. This occurred in front of about a dozen people who all tell the same basic story. The beach is called Indian Beach, in Trinidad Bay, about 20 miles north of Eureka CA, near the Humbolt Bay Marine Lab. The story will appear in the above paper tomorrow. No photos were taken as far as the reporter knows.

Two adult
grays
put on quite a show this evening for an hour and a half or more before sunset. They were feeding about 30-50 feet from shore. There were quite a few shows of pectoral fins and flukes.

About

11:30
I was down at Pt. Defiance and caught two quick glimpses of the
mystery whale
. I heard a blow earlier from Owen Beach but saw it from the Dalco lookout on the five mile drive. I couldn't tell what species but it wasn't a very large one. I also saw no tail while it dived. It was mid channel between Pt. Dalco and Pt. Defiance. A man who had been fishing from the beach came up for a better look and told me it had been swimming in circles all morning.
