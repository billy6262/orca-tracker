Orca Sightings for May 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Not an orca, but black, long, 2 fin - maybe a psueorca. 1 of them, off the south side of vashon. It was going in circles around that south end of colvos eating. -
6pm
- 8pm and the previous week. Sorry - no photos, but we watched him for a couple hours and my father in law saw it last week in the same spot.

hmmm - could possibly be a Minke, or maybe the humpback that has been down that way? Did anyone else see this? sb

Bill Applegate called Orca Network to report at least 2
orcas
, observed from Joseph Whidbey State Park from
10-
10:15 am
. They were between NW Whidbey and Lopez Island, way out in the channel, heading SW toward Smith Island. There was one adult male and one female.
The timing is right that this could have been some of the J's coming down from up north before swinging up the west side of SJI - Sb

Orca Network received calls from Carolyln Mercer and Mary Pacher, at
3 pm and
3:05 pm
, reporting a
gray whale
off Hidden Beach, N. of Greenbank. We got down to the beach at
3:25, and watched one gray feeding back and forth, in and out, until after
5 pm
when we had to leave (it was still there feeding!). It didn't show its back very often, but from what we could see of the dorsal ridge and the flukes, we are pretty sure it was Dubnuk/#44. (see photo above - the left side of the fluke has a flattened tip with 3 distinctive white circles on it.
