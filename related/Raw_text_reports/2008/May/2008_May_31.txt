Members of
J pod
entered the study area (Limekiln, W. San Juan Island) at
1453
heading north. 6 powerboats and 16 kayaks accompanied these whales through the study area. No boats were seen outside the study area. The last whale left the study area at 1513. Time from the first whale to the last whale over our line was 5 minutes, what we call our spread-out time. The rest of J pod entered our study area at 1538 heading north, though we only saw 14 pass over our line. 4 powerboats and 6 kayaks accompanied these whales through the study area. 17 powerboats were seen accompanying these whales outside the study area. The last whale left the study area at 1602. Time from the first whale to the last whale over our line was 19 minutes. Dividing this by 14 gives us what we call our spread-out time, in this case 1.36. this translates to mean that these whales were, on average, 1.4 minutes apart.

Humpback
Sighting - Pender Island. This evening at

7:35 pm
, we observed a large animal 50 metres south of Thieves Bay Marina and 100 metres offshore. Seconds later we heard a loud breath followed by the appearance of an arching back and then black flukes. This apparent humpback then showed us the underside of its flukes (
7:38pm), which were almost solid white. It looked to be headed in a southerly direction in Swanson Channel. We scanned the horizon for the next 20 minutes but did not see it again. Our first thoughts were that this was a young adult whale. In five years, this the first time we have seen a humpback (if it was a humpback?) in Swanson Channel.
