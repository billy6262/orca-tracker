Orca Sightings for May 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

2:45
we were out kayaking and spotted a
gray whale
. The whale was headed east through the passage between Point Defiance and Vashon Island. We weren't close enough to see any identifying features.

We didn't get an exact time, but approximately
5pm
two
grey whales
slowly worked their way along the south end of Camano Island, south of Pebble Beach; they were also spotted yesterday morning heading north. Most of our sightings this Spring have been one or two whales heading south to the Gedney/Hat Island area. Perhaps they travel between Gedney and Camano each day to feed?
Peg Boley, South Camano
