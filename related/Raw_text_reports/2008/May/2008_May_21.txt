Orca Sightings for May 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spent 45 minutes following the
humpback
down the beach, from

8:50 AM-
9:35 AM
) from the tip of Point Defiance (where it nearly came up to the shore) to Owen's Beach and then to the Point Defiance Boathouse and then off toward the middle of Commencement Bay and out of view.

We got positive IDs on
J-1, J-8, J-16, J-42, J-26, and J-27
. It was much easier to see them today because they were traveling together and moving slow. We began our encounter at
2pm
about 1/2 mile off Lime Kiln Lighthouse and traveled with them for a while heading north, up the west side of San Juan Island. Little J-42 proved to be a favorite again as she popped up frequently in the middle of the pack. A point of interest: We learned from Gato Verde, the Beam Reach boat, that the orcas were not very vocal today (an unusual occurrence). There were no calls or clicks, which proved curious to the Beam Reach group. Like I've said before... every day is a new experience and we've barely scratched the surface of all there is to learn.

Amy Carey called about
3 PM
today from the south end of Vashon Island to say she had seen the "mystery" whale, (so far identified as a
juvenile humpback
) that was first seen there
April 13, unless there's another large whale cavorting in circles between Pt. Defiance and Vashon Island. Amy said the one she saw was at the entrance to the Narrows.
*
Judy Moore of Greenbank, Whidbey Island called in a report of 2
gray whales
apparently feeding about 100 yards from the beach off Greenbank in Holmes Harbor at

9:30 AM
. She estimated that one was about 40' long and the other was about 25' long.
