Orca Sightings for May 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Js
were off SJI. A lone Minke whale Heading West off Point Roberts.
Peter Hamilton Some friends on the South end of [Vashon Island] called me at
3;40
with a report of the
minke/humpback mystery whale
. Sounds like it was in the same spot as the morning sighting. I'll try to go do some scouting tomorrow.

Orca Network received a call Monday AM from Gregory Gilbertson about a sighting of roughly ten orcas
~
2:30 PM
, approx. 25 miles west of
Newport OR
(240 degrees from Newport), in an area known as the "chicken ranch." He described them as hunting whales so these may have been Transients (or Offshores? or Residents?).

J POD
passing by Andrews Bay at

8:30 PM
heading north very slowly. I was on my way out around
7:30 but the water got pretty rough, but by the time I saw them at
8:30, the water was flat calm again. Last saw them passing Kellett Bluff still going north!

J pod
was here. The pod traveled up west San Juan Island in the morning, turned around at Lime Kiln and made wonderfully close passes along the beach. Many calf spyhops, almost as many adult spyhops, lots of the spyhops? where they come way out of the water and fall backwards, tail lobs, tail slaps, and rolling over and rolling over each other. J27 (Blackberry) was doing many angled dives seemingly right on top of other whales. As they went south in the afternoon fighting the flood tide, they swam in place in some of the rip currents for up to half an hour or more. It seemed they were exhibiting lots of the behaviors you see in superpods.

Sighted a
whale
this
AM
approximately .75 nm west of the Tahlequah Ferry dock, Vashon Island. Solitary, inconspicuous blow, prominent dorsal fin, didn't show fluke when it dove - looked more like a minke but we did not see white sides.

Near Strawberry Point (NE Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island). Around

10:30 PM
or so, I heard a sound like a neighbor opening/closing sliding door. When it happened 30 seconds later right in front of me I knew it was sound of a whale spout. Stepped outside tent and heard/saw puff of a third spout in light of a full moon. Neat stuff!!! Heard fourth and final spout as whale was just passing through heading southwest towards Polnell Point. Most likely a single
gray
as we have had prior gray visits this spring.

At

9:25 AM
a
gray whale
swam by Langley, right along the drop off (it was low tide), traveling from southeast to northwest. The whale did not seem to be doing any feeding just traveling slowly along.
