Orca Sightings for May 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today's trip took us back again to Point Roberts (see Tuesdays report) to spend time with
J-Pod
. We had an interested group, calm seas, and sunshine to make the day even better. We spent about an hour with J-Pod watching them forage as they headed south towards Rosario. They were all spread out and we began our encounter with J-8, Speiden, and then moved on to view J-1, Ruffles, and J-2, Granny. Granny is the matriarch of J-Pod and estimated to be nearly 100 years old!!!
