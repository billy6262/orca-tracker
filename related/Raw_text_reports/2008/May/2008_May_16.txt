Orca Sightings for May 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Regarding the Point Defiance "Mystery Whale," I believe I saw the same animal from afar on the afternoon of the 16th in the same area. I'm voting
humpback
; dorsal was too small/blunt to be a minke, and the shape of the back didn't strike me as a gray whale would. (/twocents)

I was sailing with 3 friends yesterday evening around

7:30 or
8:00 p.m.
and three of us sighted what appeared to be a fin whale. The whale (or whales--Ken saw one first and Mark & I saw one a few minutes later) was dark sable brown, very large, moving slowly on the surface for about 10 seconds. It dived, keeping its back low in the water, bending at the base of the tail without exposing its tail. At the break in its back (i.e., the flex point between the body and tail), a small, scimitar-shaped dorsal fin was seen clearly. The whale was very large, on the scale of a grey or humpback (which it did not resemble). Two of us have seen fin whales in the Bering Sea, so they aren't unfamiliar to us. Still, a live fin whale would be unusual in Puget Sound. Later that evening, I also saw an unusual orca whale, what I think might have been a lone female. It seemed unusually large for a female, but it had a very "bent" --scimitar-shaped-- dorsal fin, so I assumed it must be female. Its back was all black, no visible saddle, no notches or distinctive marks. (The light level was good enough to have seen a bright saddle, but maybe not a dark grey one.) It did not show its head or tail and I didn't see it again.At the time of the whale sightings, we were west southwest from Shilshole marina, slightly north of Murden Cove , in the south- bound shipping lane. Murden Cove is Degrees Minutes Seconds: Latitude: 473906N Longitude: 1223022W Decimal Degrees: Latitude: 47.65167 Longitude: -122.50611

Spectacular day on Monterey Bay CA! Followed three
Orcas
, transients I assume, for a while, then had two VERY friendly
humpbacks
. The Orcas looked like a mom with a calf accompanied by a not yet full grown male.

We watched
J pod
foraging and playing a few miles off Saturna heading eastward towards Point Roberts. We got great looks at J-1 and J-26 as well as a group of unidentified J-Pod females. They seemed to be in high spirits and breached and spy hopped multiple times. We even got looks at a dozen Steller Sea Lions hauled out on Boiling Reef as well as Harbor Seals hauled out nearby.

We are seeing
J Pod
right out in front of my house, just south of Henry Island, headed north.Summer is here for a couple of days.

Thanks to Jim's email, we tuned into OrcaSound and heard
orca
calls from

8:51-
8:56 am
, then a large ship passed by & the calls stopped.

At about
1240
, while surveying for marbled murrelets from R/V Rosi, I came across
J pod
passing by Iceberg Point heading towards San Juan Island. They were moving at about 5kts in classic "groups spread out" formation, probably occupying at least one square mile of water. I was able to see J19, J41, J16, J36, and J42 together with J26 a bit farther out, followed by the J11's, then the J22's and J17's together, while what I'm assuming were all of the J14's passed by about .5 miles away (I could only confirm J30 but he was with two other female-sized and a juvenile, which would make sense). Other animals were passing by well outside of binocular range. We left them as they were passing Long Island and approaching Middle Channel.

(Minke's(?) were apparently feeding. Couldn't determine direction as it (or they) were coming up in different spots.

In looking at the photos, and noting the location, we are thinking this might be the juvenile
humpback
whale that has been in the area and was recently spotted off Pt. Defiance. The fin, & the presence of a large spout make us lean more toward a humpback than a minke - but it's difficult to tell at this distance - sb

A pod of
orca
surfaced around me in Ladysmith Harbor (south of Nanaimo, BC). They stuck with me from outside Transfer Beach through the narrows and all the way down to the sawdust barge pier at the mills, about 2 NM. Distance varied between 5 and 15 meters the entire way. 5 of them, I am pretty sure. A calf and an adult that always surfaced together, two adults that always surfaced together, and a single adult that was always by himself. Or there might have been two singles, but no way to be sure. They were short dorsal fin, by the way, and all seemed to have sort of lighter grey patch somewhat in front of the dorsal fin.
