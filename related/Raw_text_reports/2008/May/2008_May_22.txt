Orca Sightings for May 22, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We flew the Twin Otter survey last Thurs. Our opportunistic whale sighting effort was for about 45 min. along a saw-tooth pattern from Cape Flattery to James Island. We were restricted to within about 10-15 miles from shore and only encountered
a few gray whales
. No killer or humpback whales were observed. Sighting conditions were actually very good.

You know its a good day when you get to take a beach stroll with a
humpback
whale. I went down to the South end of Vashon again around

1:30
today and sure enough saw spouts and some rolling pec fins just off Point Dalco. The water was absolutely flat, the tide was out and the whale was only about 50 feet off shore. As I hit that section of the beach there was not another person in sight. No boats either. Just me and a whale. I spent about 1/2 hour that way. The whale slowly moving along the shoreline and me walking along with him ( or her). As the tide changed, the whale moved a bit farther out and lucky me got to see some fabulous fluking. Watched until about
3:30 and at that point the whale had moved to the other side and was just off Point defiance.

spent most of the day on the west side of San Juan Island. They were very spread out, fishing and traveling north slowly although they turned around several times. We got great view of Ruffles, J1 and and Slicks family, including the one year old and Mike.
