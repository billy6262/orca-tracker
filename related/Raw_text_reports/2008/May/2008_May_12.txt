Two
gray whales
passed by our house(south of Mabana) about
8PM

Today we were treated to a half-hour show of two
greys
feeding off of our high bank, about half way between Pebble Beach and Camano Head, on Camano Island. They have been cruising by us the past few days, but today about

5:30 pm
they stayed, swimming back and forth below us, delighting us with lots of blows & fins.

Ideal conditions to spot quite a group of Pacific White Sided Dolphins kind of meandering around slowly, as if just taking a break. As we began moving parallel to the group, they decided that is was playtime and made a bee-line for our boat. It was amazing seeing these creatures darting around the bow of the boat, gliding along almost effortlessly. Then they'd let the wake catch up to them and would surf in the waves, only to shoot forward back to our bow. It was truly a humbling sight to see that they chose to interact with us for a few minutes, then they decided to go off elsewhere, so we continued on our way knowing we had just encountered a rare interaction. It was truly magical!

Adam U told me about seeing some
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
down near False Bay (SW San Juan Island). We zoomed on down to Pile Pt. and got our the binocs. After a half hour search we found them just north of Eagle Pt. and had a great 45 minutes watching them play, feed and travel east along the shore.

Lifeforce received a report to our Whale and Dolphin Hotline that approx. 20 orcas were in Georgia Straight heading south off the Fraser River, BC. We confirmed that it was
J pod
when they passed Lighthouse Marine Park, Point Roberts, WA at dusk. J's spent nearly 3 peaceful days in BC waters. Off the park they were moving fast and did two great breaches.

Nancy Nolan called Orca Network at

3:45 pm
to report a whale in Saratoga Passage, off Baby Island Heights, heading south toward East Pt. and Langley. She said it was close in, she heard it blow and saw the flukes, probably a gray whale?
