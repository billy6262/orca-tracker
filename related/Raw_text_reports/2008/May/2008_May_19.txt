Orca Sightings for May 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Scott Veirs called in a report of observing one
gray whale
in the kelp out side the entrance to Neah Bay the
morning
. They also observed at least 100 feeding pits in the sandy beach in front of Hobuck Resort, half way down Makah Bay.
*
Asa Spade called in a sighting of two
orcas
from
Mendocino Head CA
. He saw 1 adult and one calf, milling in the same spot just outside the surf for 20 minutes, while several seals acted agitated. Location was N39.16.436 by W123.47.987.
*
We saw just part of
J pod
off Iceberg Point, Lopez Island yesterday at about
noon
- I know we saw
J26, J27, J30 (whose fin has really sprouted!), J16 with calf J42
. Not sure who else was with this group, we did not see J1. A wonderful quiet day with them as they were moving slowly, spent a lot of time at the surface and were making their way south/southwest when we left them.

We had a report of a small group of
orcas
(appx. 6-7) near Iceberg (Lopez Island). It was part of J-Pod! We had
J14, J26, J27, J30, J40 and 2 others
just rolling around on top of one another, pushing each other around, rolling in kelp, logging on the surface, sticking their noses out of the water, tail lobbing, and a couple of large surface percussives. Our
afternoon
trip we had
J16, J26, and J42
about 8 miles south of the morning location (the rest of J-Pod was spread out over a 5-7 mile radius) and again it was so neat to see a family grouping just milling about somewhat aimlessly in the glassy waters. J42 gave us quite the treat as he breached 6 times!

I believe the
transients
in Sansum Narrows on Monday were T20 and T21. I left them Sunday night off Coal Island(Swartz Bay) at

6:30pm
and then picked them up again in Sidney Channel between James Island and Sidney Island at

8:30pm
.

Two
Transients
went south in Sansum Narrows between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island, BC
between noon and 1 PM
. One had a big dorsal fin. The other was small. They swam right by Burial Island, which was littered with many nice seal sausages hauled out on the rocks. The Transients paid no attention to these tasty morsels - obviously not hungry!
