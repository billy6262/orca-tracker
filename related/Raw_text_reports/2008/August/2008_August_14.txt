Orca Sightings for August 14, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed out about

3:00 pm
in the 19' open outboard "ORCA" that Ken Balcomb has used for field research for over thirty years. Erin Heydenreich at the helm, Ralph and Karen Munro and myself headed down the west side of San Juan Island after reports that
J's, K's and L's
had come in from Race Rocks and were out between False Bay and Eagle Pt. Ken was ahead of us in the 17' "Starlet" with some special guests. Under bright sunshine, mostly flat water or low chop, the whale- watching boats were spread out and stationary over a few square miles off South Beach by the time we approached from about a mile offshore. Soon a male dorsal rose in the distance, heading north close to shore, followed immediately by three or four smaller fins, and it was clear they were moving up the coast. We gradually angled toward shore, and soon we could ID J1 about a quarter mile away, then a sprouter and several females or juveniles. The sprouter turned out to be 13-year old J30, who proceeded to come up slowly about 20' from Ken and his guests, then circle them around their stern, rising twice more until he had given them a thorough 180 degree inspection, before moving on with the rest of the pod. As we witnessed this close encounter, 75-year old J8 suddenly rose and wheezed her distinctive blow only 30' from our bow, giving us a closeup view of her saddle patch markings. Feeling completely in the sway of orca magic, we returned to Snug Harbor just after 4 pm. Back at the Center for Whale Research at about

4:30 pm,
we watched from shore as the whales passed by heading north fairly close in. J pod and members of L pod were ID'd, we watched as more small groups came by in the next hour or so, some off in the distance.

Approximately 12
Orcas
passed Point Roberts heading North between
8 and
8:30 pm
. They were travelling at a steady pace and spread out in two groups. One whale was swimming on its back and tail lobbing for a good part of the passing. We also observed some breaches and lunges. We didn't see any large males, but we did spy one calf travelling with two adult whales.

We were fortunate to have another look at the new
L111
baby with mom L47 and siblings! The same subpods that we saw earlier that afternoon in Bellingham Channel were now further north almost off of Point Whitehorn. It was a bit of a run to get that far north, but well worth it! This group of Ls of about 15 or so Orcas was traveling at a steady speed all day and staying in a tight knit group during both trips that we observed them. There were a few times when these Ls split off into two or three family groups - but after a few dives would join back up side by side - very much a protective group of moms and their calves. A few female adults would at times spyhop and look around.
