Orca Sightings for August 12, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Island Explorer 3 was on scene with
Marina (L47), Moonlight (L83), Muncher (L91) and little L110
in the
morning
as the whales milled about in the waters near Salmon Bank. I saw a very small dorsal fin tucked in between Marina & Moonlight - L111 was born!! It sure is amazing to see just how fast last year's calves have grown! We will hopefully be saying the same thing next year about L111!

We spent the
afternoon
in close proximity to where we were yesterday, just off of San Juan Island. Members of
L pod
were coming down island at full speed when we got out there! Porpoising as if they had someplace to be - we had a few nice looks at a young Orca calf - possibly L-109 (just over a year old) or L-106 (a 3 year old male) swimming near it's relative L-27? . We were later caught off guard by a calf coming at our stern, and as required by law, we just shut down waiting for the little one to pass by. Interestingly, he or she was swimming in various directions staying within close proximity to the boat. Perhaps a little curious about the world around him or her? There was a spyhop or two and then the calf swam off. We and another boat were very surprised by a loud splash and then another as the calf did 2 full breaches, entirely clearing the water!

We saw the new baby (
L111
)! There were 3-5 whales traveling together off the south side of San Juan Island.

Center for Whale Research discovered
a new calf in L pod
, early afternoon. The new calf, designated L111, is the 6th calf of L47. L111 joins sisters L83 and L91 and nephew L110 as the newest member of the L21 subgroup. L47, at age 34, is not only a new mother but also a grandmother. Her last calf, L107, was born in the summer of 2005 but did not survive more than a few months. Based on L111's size and the apparent fetal folds (visable in the above photographs), Center for Whale Research staff believe the calf to have been be only a few hours old. Also, L47 was observed by Center staff without a calf in the evening of
August 11, aditionally indicating that L111 was born less than 24 hours before its discovery. Dave Ellifrit and Courtney Smith encountered the L21 subgroup of L pod traveling north from False Bay (48 28.47 N; 123 05.59 W) at

12:54 p.m
. Center staff immediately noticed the presence of a very small calf traveling close to L47. L47 was observed the previous day without a calf, therefore indicating that the new calf, designated L111, is less than 24 hours old. The calf is very small and orange and the fetal folds are still clearly visible (see photographs in above report & link, & at link below), further supporting the conclusion that the calf was just born that day or the night before. L111 was observed traveling tight with mother L47, sisters L83 and L91 and nephew L110. The group was traveling up and down the west side of San Juan Island close to shore and apparently foraging. L83 was seen with a fish in her mouth and the others were observed chasing and milling. The encounter ended at
2:36 p.m. just north of False Bay (48 28.62 N; 123 06.54 W). The whales continued south traveling tight and close to shore.

We then headed out to Salmon Bank where we heard we would find some of L-pod and rumors had it the exciting news of a new calf! We first viewed what we believe were the
L55's
. We then spotted a
Minke
and watched it surface several times. I have to concur with Captain Ivan that this was the smallest Minke I had ever seen. Everyone was delighted to see the little orange tinged calf popping up next to mom.
