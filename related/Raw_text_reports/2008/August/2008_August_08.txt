Orca Sightings for August 8, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod and the L part of J pod
were spectacular with close passes off the west side of San Juan Island
all day
. Lots of foraging and surface activity, mostly between Eagle Point and Lime Kiln Point.

I had been listening to the hydrophone at Lime Kiln for approximately an hour when all of a sudden at around

12:00pm
I started hearing the unmistakable sounds of Orcas passing through. This lasted until approximately
12:20pm.

Orcas
spread out from the south end of San Juan Island into the Strait of Juan de Fuca today. We arrived off of American Camp at about

2:00pm
and watched J-26 & family for the next hour do the 'south side orca salmon waltz'! First they were heading southeast, then northwest, circling, milling, zig zagging, foraging, porpoising, then slowing down, some breaches and pectoral slaps. They changed direction so many times I lost count! We also listened to incredible vocalizations! We pretty much stayed in the same spot until they were headed back northwest at about

3:15pm
, and it was safe to leave.
