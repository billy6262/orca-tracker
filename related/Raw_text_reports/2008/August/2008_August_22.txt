For over three hours (
1800 to 2100 pm
) approximately 60 members of
J pod and L pod
stayed off Point Roberts. For nearly 2 hours there were eight orcas that socialized a few hundred yards off Lighthouse Marine Park. There were repeated breaches, double Head Views (spy-hops), tail slaps and much more.

From

6:00 to
8:00 pm
: 25 plus
Orcas
cruised, foraged, and played off Point Roberts! What a treat today for those of us who watch from the beach as some whales were as close as 1 km from shore. The whales moved slowly in small groups as they spy hopped, breached, foraged, tail lobbed, and rested right off the Point. The Orcas were heading south, but as they approached the marina entrance they headed West. We observed at least 4 large males. One group of eight whales including two large males remained in the area resting and playing until

8:00 pm
.
