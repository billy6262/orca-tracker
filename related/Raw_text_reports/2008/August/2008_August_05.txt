Orca Sightings for August 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call this weekend from Randall of
Guallala, CA
, reporting an
orca
sighting, at Sea Ranch, just south of Guallala, CA, about .5 mile offshore. He saw ~ 20
orcas
cavorting, spread out over about a half mile, breaching, spy-hopping, & splashing. He said they were using the swells to propel themselves to breach higher! He thought they may have been in a school of fish, but no proof of that was given.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Courtney Smith and Mackenzie Consoier of the Center for Whale Research responded to a report of transients in San Juan Channel. The T124's, T20 (see photo above), T21 and T90 were encountered traveling south in a tight group mid channel north of Friday Harbor (48째 34.45 N; 123째 02.20 W) at
4:18 p.m. The Center followed the whales past Fisherman's Bay on Lopez Island (48째 31.67 N; 123째 56.20 W), where the encounter ended at

6:18 p.m.

Six
Orcas
passed Point Roberts between

9:00 and
9:30 pm
. The whales were far off shore, heading South, and moving quickly with a few breaches and some tail lobbing. One large male was with the group.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Reserach encountered
L pod
off Sheringham Point, Vancouver Island, B.C. at

10:00
. The whales were spread out in groups traveling east. Most of L pod was present including the L9 and L54 subgroups, which have not been previously documented by the Center this summer. The group of L's came in to Salmon Bank in Haro Strait where they met up with
J pod
at sunset. The encounter ended at Salmon Bank just after

9:00 p.m.
with the whales milling in mid strait. Report & GREAT photos at Center for Whale Research.

Spotted an
orca
pod and was visited by them up close and personal. That was an amazing experience to view them in their natural state. We couldn't believe it when they came right towards and under us to show their stuff.

Turns out they were
transients
in the channel between the Cactus Islands and Speiden Island, and we were able to ID T20 (with his distinctive notch), the T124's, and I heard we also had T19. We called the Center to let them know, so they will be able to confirm the IDs. We watched them as they slowly moved down San Juan Channel, and we last left them passing Reid Rock near the entrance to Friday Harbor. Just before we left, we saw what appeared to be either a large harbor porpoise (or maybe a Pacific White sided dolphin?) leaping out of the water a good 3-4 feet a ways ahead of the transient pack). I can only speculate that this poor animal somehow knew transients were heading his way and decided that it was best to speed out of the way before he became supper.

While traveling on the

5:05 PM
Washington State Ferry from Friday Harbor to Anacortes we were treated to a very nice show by a small group of
orcas
just outside of Friday Harbor, south of Shaw Island. We don't know how many were in the group, possibly three or more, with one large male.

The rest of
L pod
came back this
afternoon
. They were at Race Passage around
1700
and we left them at
1930
about 3 miles east of Seabird lighthouse. Lots of breaches, tail slaps and quite a bit of porpoising. They were really booking it to the west side!

From the first transit run out to the south end of San Juan Island at about

10:20am
,
orcas
off South Beach, ebbing tide. They took their time, looking like they were going to ride the now flooding tide up Haro Strait by
2:30pm. Nope! Fooled ya! They turned around, back south by
4:30pm. The south end shuffle today, for at least 6 hours!!

Jpod
and possibly
L57
? (got a good view of what looked like him) passed the Orcacam west San Juan Island today around
1:30pm (Caribbean time that would be

Here is a photo of
L-57
, well his fluke anyway, taken at the Lime Kiln SP light
this morning
. He surfaced in the kelp several times, including twice right in front of some lucky folks.

We came across [
orcas
] near Eagle Point. They were very spread out, and foraging in many different directions. First came J27 Blackberry, who's dorsal fin seems to loom larger every time I see him. We dropped the hydrophone in and were hearing lots of faint calls at first, and then they grew stronger as more and more whales began to show up. Before long, we also were able to ID J11 Blossom, the J22's (J22 Oreo, J34 Doublestuff, J38 Cookie), some of the L26's (which this year must think they are J's). Amidst all the whales swimming in all directions, passing the boat several times, we had a very nice visit with J31 (Tsuchi), who decided to log on the surface for a bit. Then she lifted her head and gave the kids a very loud, 6 second surface vocalization.
