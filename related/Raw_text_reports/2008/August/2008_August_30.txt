Orca Sightings for August 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
About 2 miles off of American Camp we spotted a
Minke Whale
! A little detour to the left and we were able to watch a few of the Minke's dive sequences! Typically an individual will have a sequence of shallow dives, surfacing to breathe every 30-60 seconds, followed by a deeper dive that will last for several minutes. Just before we entered Friday Harbor we watched a small pod of
Harbor Porpoise
swimming about! Up the west side, (of SJ Island) we met up with the
J & K Pods of Orcas
cruising with the flooding tide. They were moving and most were hugging the shoreline! A few peeled offshore a bit. We ended up with some great looks at J27 (Blackberry), and what looked like the J-16s as they came up to Open Bay. There were breaches off in the distance, tail slapping, probably some socializing going on between Orcas.

As we got a water view from the south end of San Juan Island, at

1:20pm
, we could see fins and whale watch boats all along the south end. At about
2:15pm, we saw the leaders and we scrambled to Lime Kiln Point State Park. We, and many others on land watched approximately 45+ [
orcas
] passing by close to the shoreline! There were many tight groups traveling very fast with the strong flooding tide. I'm guessing they were going 10 knots or more! I could ID L-57, hard to ID any others swimming so fast! Jeanne Hyde was there and got photos of J's, K's, & L's. One whale breached, near shore, right before the lighthouse, as if it knew it's adoring fans were watching! Lots of vocalizations came over the hydrophone array while they passed! As they headed toward Open Bay, there was some tail slaps and percussive behavior in the current line. They were in the distance in about 20 minutes, but we waited til the last 3 orcas passed much further out in Haro Strait at about
3:30pm.

Marc of the Victoria Clipper lll called Orca Network to report 3
orcas
off Marrowstone Pt. in Admiralty Inlet at approx.

5:55 pm
. He called back at 6 pm to say there were 4 orcas - 1 male, 2 females & 1 juvenile. They were inbound, heading from Marrowstone Pt. toward Bush Pt.
*
At about
6 pm
I was able to watch the whale (
orca
) spouts in the bay off Ft. Flagler. A small yacht was very close to them, following them for an hour or so; after a while the yacht seemed to be just floating and watching. I thought I saw 5 or 6 spouts. I tracked the whales off and on until it got too dark (a little after 8), when they were just off the southern end of Marrowstone Island, still slowly heading south. I didn't see spouts as they moved south, but I saw fins-one male, several medium-sized, and at least two very small. At first, the male fin was next to a med- sized fin, and later the male seemed to be alone. Two little fins were very close together. I'd say there were at least 7 whales, and maybe more.

1700-1730
. Four
orca
were sighted from Point Wilson heading east in Admiralty Inlet. Two males a calf and female all were staying close to each other. Off of Admiralty Bay there was a big commotion with splashing and tail slaps by the two males, then I lost sight of the orca. This maybe the four orca that I observed on 8-28-08.

orcas
off Eagle Pt, San Juan Island. There were approximately 8 orcas, heading east, no males present.
