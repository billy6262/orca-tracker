Orca Sightings for August 2, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Park Campground

6:00 til
6:35 p.m
. About 13 whales. Led by a couple of single whales. Lots of distance between whales. Whales quite visible but pretty far out from shore. We had heard at Lime Kiln Interpretive Ctr. that J's and L's had joined up quite a ways out in water from False BAy earlier that day in a mini Superpod. So I imagine these were a mix of both. Unmistakable Ruffles and other large males in this group. After a LONG pass of whales far out, we were SO VERY lucky that they decided to switch direction and head back South. SO now they came by the opposite direction and much closer to shore. They passed VERY close to island in front of campground. Some milling (males I think) and some sexy play close to shore. We got a great view from shore and cheered them on as a few passed between little island and campground. WHAT a SHOW!! Then I quickly headed to Lime Kiln at
6:45 p.m. Another great show as they passed the lighthouse area close in. Saw 3 porpoising toward us in synchronicity. Got a great photo of Ruffles following (Granny?) and lots of other great passers-by (males and females) that I can't ID. I also got an unbelievable photo of a sea snake fully extended out of water in front of campground. Was he flashing us on-shore onlookers??? These whales engender so much love and wonder from us gawkers. I feel lucky to have spent a week on San Juan.

The sun was shining, the water was calm, and
Js and Ls
were on the move. We visited the two pods on the west side of San Juan Island. Our first trip took us to False Bay. Our subsequent trips found us at the entrance to Mosquito Pass and then north of Stuart Island. The animals seemed to be moving quite fast all day and with purpose. We got positive IDs on L57, J1, J2, J22, J34, J17, the J11s and L53. The animals seemed to become a bit playful as the day progressed and we even saw a J1 BREACH!!!! (A first for me.) We also saw multiple cartwheels and spy hops.

At

1:30pm
, while tide pooling at Eagle Cove, San Juan Island, we saw
orcas
heading along the south end, up the west side of San Juan Island with the flooding tide! We headed to Lime Kiln Point State Park. J-Pod groups spread out & passing the lighthouse by 3pm, although we watched a male in the distance for another 20 minutes, that was milling & circling back, seemed to be foraging.

Orca Network received a call from someone on Mayne Island, B.C. reporting first 10, then 20
orcas
off Mayne Island heading toward Active Pass at
8 pm
.

At

3:15 pm
we finally actually saw
orcas
on the OrcaCam! At
3:25 we heard some calls on the OrcaSound hydrophone.

This
morning
on Hein Bank (south of San Juan Island) we topped off our morning spending time with the
Orca
. Members of both J and L pods making their way to the west side of San Juan Island to feed.

Orca Network received a call from Timothy Cleaver Stoddard, reporting a very interesting incident off west San Juan Island. He and his captain, Cody Johnson, were anchored in a small bay south of False Bay Saturday night in 30' of water. At
11 pm
, a whale came up under their 25' sailboat and 14' skiff, lifting them both out of the water 2'! They didn't see a dorsal fin on the whale, and the whale had barnacles on it -
sounds like a gray whale
, which also would be likely to be in such shallow waters if it was feeding.
