We just left the whale park at San Juan Island, we saw the
J and L
pasing by. It was very close to the rocks. They were so close I had to zoom out with my lens.

2 pm
- As we approached Henry Island
J Pod
was moving north across to Stuart Island. The Orcas were spread out - we had J19 and J41 cross by our stern offshore of the others. Looked like almost the entire J Pod was there, maybe a few members further south where the other boats were. We paralled J1 and the other Orcas swimming close by to him till they were off of Turn Point, Stuart Island. Throughout this encounter, we had a few direction changes and one great look at J1 on a deeper dive foraging. There was some splash activity: a few breaches, more foraging, and tail slaps.
