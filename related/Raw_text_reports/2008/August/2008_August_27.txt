Orca Sightings for August 27, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

4:30 PM
I heard that there was a group of 6-8
transients
(reportedly the T19s and T30s) heading north from Pile Point on San Juan Island. I saw them travel quickly north from several places on shore, and they were mostly a half mile or so offshore. The most amazing encounter occurred in Andrews Bay, where two animals (a male and a female with a distinct notch at the base of her fin) passed Low Island and then headed straight for the shoreline! At the northern part of Andrews Bay as they headed directly at me. Then, they started circling, and just as I was wondering if they were about to make a kill a relatively small harbor seal head popped up between the two whales. I saw the seal for a few more seconds, then a little splashing, and then both the whales continued on their way north. What I couldn't believe is that all this occurred within 75 yards of the shoreline! You don't see tranisents from shore over here all that often, and certainly not that close. Most of the kill occurred under the surface and it was all over in a matter of a couple minutes

From looking at the Transient ID guide, I'd say the female pictured above looks like T18 - sb

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J's, K's and L's
spread out heading north at Battleship Rock at

1:00 p.m.
The whales continued to travel up Boundary Pass, where the encounter ended one mile north of East Point at

3:00 p.m.

Today we watched most of the
L12's
traveling northeast along the south side of Saturna Island, with the strong flood tide, from

2:30 to
3:20pm.
A glimpse of L2 with L67, and just one of the boys- not sure if L78 or L88. Sadly, did not see L101. Then L25, with L12 (Ken Balcomb was taking photos- hope he can confirm), L77, & L94. L41 close to his family. As they passed East Point, L41 headed around the reef with 2 of the females, while the other 2 cut across the reef into the Strait of Georgia. There were a couple of breaches and an answering tail slap as they passed the point. They seemed to be heading toward Point Roberts, where further ahead, through binoculars, we could see a large group of whales. Saw the last group of 3 to 4 trailers as we headed home.

L25, L77, L41, L94, and L72
passed close to shore by Lime Kiln yesterday. Neat to see them in this configuration, especially since most of the other KW's rocketed by in singles and pairs.

We heard some
So. Resident
calls on the OrcaSound hydrophone at about

11:20 am

morning
headed north towards Lime Kiln Lighthouse, W. San Juan Island,

9:30 AM
.

At
0815
we started hearing some high frequency sounds and whistles on the Lime Kiln hydrophone. These progressed into southern resident calls (S1, S2i, S2iii, S4, S16, S17, S18, S19, S37, S40) and it sounds like
all three pods
have joined together and are moving north along the westside!

We have only lived on the sound in Gig Harbor, Wa for a little more than a year so we were very excited to see
orcas
last night, at

7:00 pm
. We were in our backyard so we didn't see any specific markings or get photos but there were two large orcas and one smaller one traveling south. We live directly across from Pt Defiance Park in Tacoma and are north of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

We saw at least 4
Orcas
last night. They were headed south under the Narrows Bridge in Tacoma. We saw them from our house on the bluff but there appeared to be at least one large male and two to three others. It was approximately
7pm
.

Hello from
Adak AK
! As I hiked along the beach of Kulak Bay, I spotted a whale, probably a
Minke
. It was quite a ways out in the bay but I had binoculars and watched it for about 20 minutes.
