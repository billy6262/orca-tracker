============================================================

Entry 1:
Between

5:00 and
5:30 pm
six
Orcas
were again heading South as they passed Point Roberts. They were travelling far offshore and moving quite quickly. There was one large male present.

As we sighted Lime Kiln, the
orcas
had turned back south! Caught up with them at about

3:30pm
south of Hannah Heights, J1 so nicely visible from a distance. Another directional change back northwest- the south side shuffle again! Several groups of 3-4 whales spread out foraging, some pausing to tail lob, breach, lunge, and do full body rolls!! We got a good look at J2 & L57 swimming together! The orcas were still heading northwest, when we left at about

4:15pm
.

Jeff Hogan called at about

7:40 pm
to alert us of
orca
calls on OrcaSound's Lime Kiln hydrophone - we tuned in to listen to what sounded like a rowdy party, but within about 10 minutes they had faded away.

Well, once again
JPod
has decided to divide and conquer when it comes to hunting salmon. Yesterday we had the J11's, J22's, and L26's, and today we had the rest of J's (yesterday's whales are up north where todays whales were yesterday--got it?) Whales were quite spread out off False Bay, and were slowly foraging towards Lime Kiln. It was a classic day however for observing whale behaviors---you could practically use a checklist: tail lob (check), pec slap (check), spy hop (check x 3), vocalizations (classic J calls, check), upside down swimming (check), breaches (check x 3 as well). First we observed J2 and J1 traveling along with L57, and the rest of the gang. After watching them a bit, we decided to head over to the other group (J16, J26, and I think J33), and observed the "poop sniffers" training Tucker the wonder dog to find scat in the water.
