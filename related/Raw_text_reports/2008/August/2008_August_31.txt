J, K and some members of L pod

10:33 a.m.
The whales were spread out in groups and traveling slowly south. All of J pod was documented, and most of K pod as well as the L26's, L4's, some of the L47's, and a few others. The encounter ended at

Orca Network received a call from Janet Cavelero reporting a sighting of a single
orca

. She saw 1 female orca, 100 yards offshore heading north. At

2:45 pm
she saw it heading south, then saw it heading north again.

Watched the
T41's
with what looked like the
T137's
Sunday
afternoon
. They were killing harbour seals off of the reef near Oak Bay Marina. They were in the same spot for over an hour. At
1800hrs
they continued back to the west. Earlier in the day they were spotted inside the mouth of Victoria's harbour.

We came out of Cattle Pass into the Strait of Juan de Fuca at

11:35am
, slack ebb tide to calm conditions and great visibility. We could see groups of [
orcas
] that appeared to be heading east. We were about 1/2 mile from shore and realized the whales were traveling fairly fast and we would not be able to head out and around them, so we shut down and stayed put off of South Beach- Mt. Finlayson. L-57 with 4 other whales passed about 500' away, at first heading out toward Salmon Bank, then circled back in front of the boat! We had given the whales lots of room, so it really felt like the whales chose to come closer to us. Several other groups of whales, including a large tight group of 12 or more were further out in the Strait heading to Salmon Bank. People were fishing on a small boat near us, so I hollered 'how's the fishing?',(thinking it might not be so good with the orcas around), they held up a 38 pound Chinook salmon, saying they caught a 41 pound Chinook a few days before!! It seems unusual to me that most of the SRKW community has stayed together for 6 days now- hope that means they are feeding well too! Sure enough, after the sweep, (checking out the salmon buffet on Salmon Bank?), all the groups turned back toward the Island! We were treated to vocalizations and echolocation clicks on the hydrophone. Several whales were lunging, pushing up huge wakes! Then breaches, spy hops, and tail slaps!! ID'd J- 2, J-1, J-16 & the kids- J-26, J-33, J-36, J-42. L-72 with L-105, & L-95, L-104. L-22 with L-79. Many more distant groups, all heading northwest by
12:45pm.

I saw this Whale at
7 pm
off Iceberg Pt. Lopez. It was just going around in circles; 30' to 40' Long. I think it was a
Minke
can you confirm? (
Yes it was a minke - sb
)
