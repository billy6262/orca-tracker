Orca Sightings for August 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
transients
we thought might be lurking in the area- -T20, T124's turned up at Bedwell harbor with the T19's!

From about

19:45 -
20:30
, observed 30 - 40
orcas
, heading west in Boundary Pass. A good number of mature males were involved. I can say that between them, there were an easy 150-200 breaches alone. For about 20 minutes, as they passed from Skipjack Island to Monarch Head on Saturna Island, there was what appeared to be a competition, with sometimes as many as five orcas breaching at the same time. A number of them seemed to be just breaching their way west. It just went on and on. Mixed in with that was every kind of tail slap, flip, cartwheel and moves I can hardly describe.

The
L12's
shuffled between Eagle and almost as far north as Lime Kiln Point
all day
. Lots of tall fins--L79, L74, I think L73, L41. Also females. L25 had dinner at about

6:15 pm
just north of Edwards. She was slowly foraging, seemingly lackadaisically, when she emerged with a fish in her mouth. Then she did a swan dive, still with fish in mouth and emerged several more times before she went down for a couple of minutes and surfaced fishless. There were no other whales in her immediate vicinity, so I don't think she shared. There were about 10-12 whales altogether off the west side today.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Courtney Smith, and Mackenzie Consoier of the Center for Whale Research encountered members of
L pod
spread out off Land Bank (48 30.169 N; 123 09.468 W) at

11:57
. The whales were milling, but generally moving slowly south. The individuals encountered were L12, L25, L41, L77, L85, L22, L79, and L89. However, a few more animals may have been in the area that were not seen. The encounter ended at
1:54 1.5 miles northwest of Eagle Point (48 27.574 N; 123 03.402 W) with the whales still spread out and heading down the west side of San Juan Island.

I am wondering if any one else had any thoughts on the behavior seen by one female? I don't know that either of us ever got a photo of her, but she was with the group including L77. While watching her, both Caroline and I thought she was either sick, or in labor - especially since a few orcas (potentially an auntie?) surrounded her. (see Caroline's report from that day for a recap - below). I had watched a show about a captive orca giving birth, and she arched her back up like a cat several times during labor (contractions?) to try to push the calf out, and while watching this mystery female it almost looked as if her back arched up a few times. The new calf showed up sometime between that evening and the next afternoon, so I feel like this must have been L47, but again, no ID was ever made.

We arrived off the south end of San Juan Island, in glass like waters, at
2 pm
to see
L-85
zig zagging his way northwest. We could see other small groups of
orcas
spread out from Eagle Cove into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, some heading southeast, so we stayed put. Soon L77 and her sister L94 came into view. Then we noticed a female that just stopped and logged on the surface. Well this female stayed at the surface for the next 20 minutes! She seemed to be drifting, shallow breathing, resting, her body sinking at times so we just saw her rostrum and tip of her dorsal fin. Then her chin came up out of the water several times, as if her body had sunk vertical. Other times she rolled onto one side, holding the position, or onto her back with pectoral fins raised. Meanwhile, L-77, L-94, and L-22, L-79 were circling her, milling, appearing to forage in the same area, staying close to her. She rolled on her side once again, slowly raised her right pectoral fin, slapped the water twice, which was repeated by a whale near her. The other orcas slapped their tail flukes on the water repeatedly, she rolled onto her back again for a while, logged a bit more, then dove, resurfacing swimming northwest with L-77 & L-94. L-22 and L-79 foraged for awhile more before also heading northwest, when we headed back at
3:30pm. I didn't ever see her saddle patch, that's how low in the water she was, but from the nicks in her dorsal and fin shape I think it was L-12. At one point there was a circle of boats about half a mile wide, drifting with the orcas, observing this most unusual behavior. We put our hydrophone in the water, but they were pretty quiet, a few vocalizations and echolocation clicks. I can't recall seeing anything quite like this before! What struck me was I have seen resting formations many times, but several whales resting together- not just one in the group. Also, I think of orcas as being in constant motion, even while resting they are still making some forward progress. And when we really are only witnessing such a small portion of their lives, that which they show us at the surface, it was pretty incredible to see this orca continuously at the surface, relatively still and in the same area for 20 minutes! I am very interested to hear others ID on this whale and their interpretations! (L-12 is estimated to be 75 years old, but I've not seen J-2 take long naps by herself! Then again, the "L-12's" do tend to exhibit some of the most unusual behaviours in the community.)

About a dozen or so L-pod
Orcas
were just off of Eagle Point and South Beach off San Juan Island. It was one of the calmest days out there this summer. On both trips we saw the L-12s - grandmother Alexis with her grand-calves - L-41 (Mega, a large male with 2 notches on the trailing edge of his dorsal), L-77 (Matia, a 21 year old female), and younger sister L-94 (Calypso, born in 95). The other sub pod included L-85 (Mystery), with cousin L-22 (Spirit) and her 2 sons L-79 (Skana) & L- 89 (Solstice). We could hear their breathing and L-12 (Alexis) would log at the surface for minutes on end. There was very little vocalizing, but some echolocating on both trips. Both L-12 and one of her daughters L77 or L94 were logging, and rolling onto their sides, with flipper slaps and a little spy hop with just their chins sticking out! These L-pod members were here all day, changing direction, just milling about. In the evening the L-12s paraded south together to Salmon Bank.

I was in a small boat off East Point, Saturna Island at about

12:30
as 12-15
orcas
, travelling in three groups, made their way across Boiling Reef and past us heading north. There were two mature males, but I never got a good photo of their saddles. They changed direction a number of times, but didn't really appear to be foraging, just travelling.

Residents were reportedly about 6 miles north of the Fraser. We had a call from Alison (one of our naturalists), who had heard that a friend on the ferry had spotted whales between Shaw & Lopez Islands. Then another call from another of our naturalists (Cindy, who already sent you a report) said she saw some whales in San Juan Channel. So off we searched down San Juan Channel, and sure enough, 3-5 dorsal fins were spotted working the flood tide near Goose Island. Residents! We were looking at the
L12's
. They were a bit spread out as they headed out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but there was L12, L85, L41, and all the rest of the gang. We watched a minke whale over a mile away! And it was so amazing to watch a few of the whales actually head over and chase the minke for a couple of minutes. Later in the afternoon on our second trip, the L12's were doing the classic West Side Shuffle between Hannah Heights and Eagle Point. The whales didn't seem to be in any hurry to get anywhere, and were doing a lot of echolocation clicks and vocalizations, a few of which were so loud they echoed underwater. On the drive home after work, L12's were at the Landbank property heading slowly towards Lime Kiln.

Beam Reach alumni Laura Madden and Celia Barroso called from the Island Commuter at
1355
, saying a few members of
L pod
passed them off of the south end of SJI traveling southward, with other members of L (and other?) pods approaching them from points further north in Haro Strait.

Today we took the ferry from Pender Islands to Swartz Bay. We left the terminal around

8:30 a.m.
and were soon told by the captain that the
orcas
were off the port bow. The ferry tilted as all ran to the port side to view the whales. There were 6 whales about 200 or 300 feet away. They were blowing and swimming near the shore of North Pender Island.

I was on the ferry coming into Friday Harbor at

7:40 am
and there were 3
orcas
right outside the harbor heading south down San Juan Channel. I unfortunately didn't have binoculars or a camera with me and only caught a few glimpses so I couldn't get any id's but maybe someone will be able to id them later today.

Just spotted what I'm pretty sure was a
Minke
at
1030
. About 20' long, very pronounced sharp curved dorsal fin makes me think it had to be a Minke. Heading north in Colvos Passage, very close to west shore apx 1 mile south of the Southworth ferry.

This morning while fishing I saw a
Minke
Whale in Colvos Passage heading north. It was about 1/3 the way from shore on the Gig Harbor side and surfaced 3 times.
