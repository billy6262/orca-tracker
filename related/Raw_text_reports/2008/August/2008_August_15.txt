Orca Sightings for August 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Heading north in Haro Straight just south of San Juan Island on San Juan Safari tours we were so lucky to see the
superpod
. It was about

2:30 pm
. All three resident pods are believed to be a part of this superpod (see photo above). Ruffles was easy to pick out.

Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Kathy Babiak, and Mackenzie Consoier of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J's, K's and L's
traveling southwest from False Bay (48 27.615 N; 123 03.734 W) at

4:52 p.m
. The whales were spread out in tight groups. The first group encountered was the L22's just north of Eagle Point. The next group encountered was the L47's with new calf L111. L47, L83, L91 and L110 were traveling tight with the new calf , exhibiting a lot of social and tactile behavior. L47 was observed pushing L111 around on her rostrum which allowed Center staff to get a photo of the calf's underbelly and determine that
L111 is a female
. She still has a piece of her umbilical cord attached. The L47's were shortly joined by K21, K16 and K35 who also appeared to be playing with the calf. The animals were very tactile, rolling around and breaching. J pod as well as the L12's and the rest of the K's were reported in the area but were not seen or documented by the Center staff. The encounter ended at

6:00 p.m.
, north of Hein Bank (48 24.800 N; 123 02.430 W). The whales continued traveling southwest.

Superpod
! How does one describe an encounter with 87, or a good portion of, the southern resident community of
killer whales
in their natural habitat?! First we saw a Steller sea lion on Whale Rock, numerous harbor seals in the water, to come around the corner into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the south end of Lopez Island at

2:30pm
to see the first of 3 huge groups of orcas heading west with the strong full moon tide, although with no wind, the water was a pond and excellent visibility. The first close formation of whales was mostly J-Pod, could ID J-1 & many others. They seemed intent on continuing west. The next 2 groups passed slower, we could ID lots of L's, also in close formations, with newborn L-111 again tucked in close to mom & aunties. We were awed by seeing 12 or more whales surface together, breaches, tail lobs, cartwheels, headstands, spy hops in unison, back flips, side breaches, full breaches, lunges and upside down swimming! We actually had a hard time identifying individuals as there were so many, so close together, so active! Headed back at

3:30 pm
.

There are some
Orcas
on the West Side (San Juan Island) this
morning
. We think it's a few Ls. And there are Orca going west out west of Victoria.
