Orca Sightings for August 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Mike, with a report of
orcas
off the
OR
Coast at 42 10 N 125 25 W while tuna fishing (offshore, about half way between Brookings & Gold Beach, OR). Water temp was 61.5 - 62.5 degrees. There were 4 orcas, including 1 adult male. No direction of travel, just milling behavior.

Strong afternoon flood tide, members of
J Pod
heading east off False Bay, San Juan Island, at about

2:15pm
. I think the 1st group we saw, of 3 orcas, might have been ?J-11 with J-31 & J-30, but J- 27 wasn't with them. Then J-30, followed about 5 minutes later by J-14, J-37, J-40, & J-19- again I am not positive on ID's. This group paused and did some tail lobbing and one individual did an impressive head stand- holding their tail flukes above the water for quite a few seconds!

5:53pm
Orcas
observed from San Juan County Park shoreline, traveling Northward. Approx: 48.542921, -123.163133. Orcas demonstrated occasional direction changes and pectoral fin slaps. Most stayed in a tight formation, turning tail lobs over to the side at the last moment, with two breaches. Two males with large dorsal fins traveled behind, closer to the shoreline. The center group included one orca who performed a rapid series of tail lobs. Another went into a slow-motion spyhop breach, followed by other breaches closer to San Juan Island. Females at center formed a tighter group with more direction changes and a double-breach.

6:11pm
- more breaches from tighter group; two males continued to flank and follow closer to shoreline. Tail lob.
6:19pm - males criss-crossed each other just in front of houses at point North of the Park, including a 180 degree roundhouse tail lob. Center group moved to join males close to the point, then changed direction to swim Southbound toward the small island off the Park shoreline. More spyhops were observed, and a large dorsal fin was visible on the other side of the small island.

6:40pm
- breach off point. Two orcas swam between the small island and the shoreline, visible about 100 feet offshore as they continued Southward out of sight.

J's
are being chatty again on OrcaSound. Clicks, whistles and calls - everything! I tuned it at
6.15 pm
but around 6.25pm the boat noise overpowered - too bad.

Today we went to the the southern part of San Juan Island past Cattle point. There were
orcas
. Some jumped out of the water, while others slapped their tails against the surface. We saw J-pod family members J-8 Spieden, J-19 Sachi, and a lot of other females!

It was time to walk the minke. we came across a small
minke
west of hein bank. it was very active, each first surfacing in a sequence was a vigorous one. either high out of the water, a lunge, a breach or something. we thought at first it was feeding, but there were no birds in the area, and no fish on the fish finder. the whale started on more or less a straight line course, and we headed in the same direction. each first surfacing in a sequence, not only was vigrous, but became closer to us. it became apparent the whale was interested in us. over the course of three hours, we had a pleasant stroll over to Smith Island - a boy and his minke. We got an identification, and some idea of large scale movement of an individual, but other data were biased, thus unusable since the whale was obviously very interested in us. but it was one of those days that we will remember, for it makes up for all of those days when we see a minke once, and then not again, or for when a whale is acting squirrely, in other words, just like a minke.
