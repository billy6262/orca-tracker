on the south end of San Juan Island, Cattle Point to Kanaka Bay. Milling & foraging? the 1st few hours in the last of the ebb tide, then seemed to head offshore more toward Salmon Bank as the flood tide kicked in.

. three
harbor porpoise
hanging out about a half mile off the point with an adult bald eagle over them. LOTS of juvenile coho and chum and small inmigrating coho and big chinook - eagles after salmon and porpoises after all that mix of smaller stuff. The porpoises move west then east. The eagle is over them for about 15 minutes, dives a few times, comes up empty. Flies to shore. Porpoises going south.
