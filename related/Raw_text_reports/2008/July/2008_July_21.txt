Orca Sightings for July 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a wonderful encounter with
J1, J2, J27, L57, the J22's, J28
. We were spending some quality time with J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny who were leading the group and were actively fishing in the strong currents near Kellett Bluff. Then they slowed down to allow J19 and J41 to catch up with them. It was so cool to watch this little group travel along the shoreline, frequently coming to the surface amidst the thick kelp beds that line that part of the island. Then Ruffles did something I've never seen him do. He'd come to the surface, dive down, and the next surfacing would be a big spyhop. Then 2-3 more surfacings and another spyhop! He did 4 of these, and one time he had a bit of kelp on his massive pectorals! Then J41 started holding his tail flukes high out of the water, as if to show "uncle ruffles" his bit of acrobatics. It was so relaxing yet so fun to watch these whales carrying on in their daily lives.

By sea; The
noon
reports were that
J-Pod
was slooowly heading north up the west side of San Juan Island. Indeed they were meandering with a flood tide just starting to pick up, as we watched them south of Mosquito Pass from about
2pm
until we left at

3:35PM
. There were 2 groups that passed heading north, then seem to circle back. J1 was then in the lead, J2 right behind, followed by J8- she still has that raspy blow! Next was J14, J30, J37, J40 all close to shore. Further out, J27 was with little brother J39, followed closely by J41 with J31. The last group stuck close to the shoreline. A bit of milling, foraging, directional changes, but mostly a very, very slow northward travel mode. We sighted J1 shortly after we arrived, yet he had only just made Henry Island well over an hour later!

Another sighting by my wife, over the Hood Canal Bridge, yesterday, at
10 am
. She saw maybe four or five spouting marine mammals. Close to Sisters Rock. Saw no dorsals or backs, spouts about 3 feet high puffs she says.
