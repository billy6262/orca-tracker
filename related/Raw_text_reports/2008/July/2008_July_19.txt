Orca Sightings for July 19, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, on the vessel Starlet, encountered members of
J, K, and L pod
traveling south from Point Roberts (48째 57' 51.48 N, 123째 2' 8.16 W) at

10:30 a.m.
The whales were spread out across Boundary Pass. K21 was seen and documneted in this encounter and appears healthy. In addition to K pod, some members of J pod were present as well as the three L's (L7, L53, and L57) that have been traveling frequently with J and K pod. The encounter ended at
4:18 p.m. with the whales continuing south past Saturna Island, B.C (48째 5' 11.88 N, 123째 6' 18.00 W).

Rick Hoover called Orca Network to report a sighting of 5 - 6
orcas
, including a few younger ones at 6 am off Ediz Hook, near Pt. Angeles. He said it looked like they were rushing the beach for salmon.

gray whale
heading south in Possession Sound at

This morning on the Kittiwake, Captain Nancy and I headed south down San Juan island on the west side to False Bay. We had an excellent time with
J-pod
! In the afternoon we were out again, this time deciding to head North. There were J-pod family members and
K-pod
together. We went up to Boundary Pass, and saw the large male Cappuccino. There were several females, and we saw a lot of breaches!

2pm-
5:30pm, Orcas
once again visited East Point, Saturna Island, making it at least 5 visits in the last six days according to locals, four of which I myself witnessed. Saturday afternoon's visit had two separate pods coming together at East Point (J's and possibly both K's and L's), working against a very stiff flooding current, making for very slow going, and spectacular viewing. Upwards of 40-45 orcas, travelling, foraging and playing around for over three hours. Lots of breaching, tail slapping and spy hopping. My neighbors out in their 15' fishing boat attracted a lot of attention, with numerous orcas stopping and spy hopping 5' from the boat before moving on. A small group of about 7 orcas crossed boundary pass late in the afternoon and appeared to be foraging around Bare Island and Skipjack Island, and seeing as they spent about an hour there, must have been meeting with some success.

The whales decided to stay in the area and congregate up around the Fraser River. Well, most of the whales that is. Adopting the "lone group" strategy of the L12's (or L11's depending on who you are talking to), the
J14's, J16's and J8
decided to buck the big group and hang out on their own. So we had the new "J-Loners" down on the west side and the rest of J's, K's and some L's coming down Boundary Pass. As near as we can tell, the K's and maybe the L's went west in the night, while the larger group of J's went back up north. And the "J-Loners"? Once again, they decided to hang out doing the "west side shuffle" between Eagle Point and Deadman's Bay for most of the day. During our morning trip, we watched the whales do a lot of foraging at False Bay, with many direction changes as they pursued fish. About half a dozen breaches interspersed with long dives. In the afternoon, the whales decided that perhaps it was time to go searching for the rest of J's and headed up north. We mostly watched the whales from about 1/4-1/2 mile until after they passed the lighthouse, and then we had a beautiful viewing of J16 & J42, with J42 sticking his head way out of the water on every surfacing! BUT - wouldn't you know it, the other J's that were up north were last reported in Rosario Channel heading South!
