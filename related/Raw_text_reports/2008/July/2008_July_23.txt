Orca Sightings for July 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We arrived at Open Bay, San Juan Island about

2:40pm
, slack ebb tide, as part of
J-Pod
was heading north at a leisurely pace. Could not positively ID the first 2 groups we saw, then J14 passed with J37 & J40. J30 was not with them. then came J1 who seemed to be foraging, as he circled & zig zagged several times while making northward progress. The time between his surfacings and dives were so slow, everyone was able to get photos! J2 fairly close behind. The J14 group went in toward Spieden Island, exhibiting a burst of activity- 5 tail lobes in a row, J14 breached twice followed by a breach by one of the youngsters!

Today Captain Mike, Naturalist Megan, and I all went to the west side of San Juan Island. We all gathered to watch
J-pod
family members today. Mike, his little sister J-42, and their mother Slick were together. The large male Ruffles was swimming with them too. Ruffles is such a unique orca, that it is always fun to watch him. He was fishing today. There a few others farther away that we couldn't identify, but I'm sure they were from the J's.
