Orca Sightings for July 9, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Toward the end of a weak ebb tide, at about

2:15 pm
, we found
J-Pod
heading southeast along San Juan Island. They were in small family groups, not quite porpoising, yet swimming with purpose. Little J-42 was keeping up. J-1 Ruffles was a bit further offshore, by himself. They all were heading offshore into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, past Salmon Bank. About a half an hour later, a resting group of 10 to 15? killer whales were slowly heading southeast, also offshore. A powerful sight with many males, all those tall (& small!) dorsal fins right next to each other & some breathing in unison! They were taking long 3 minute or more dives. We ID'd L-12 Alexis, L-41 Mega, L-57 Faith. Reports were that there were K's in this group also. Was anybody able to ID?

We got to Hannah Heights where we were staying at about

2:15 pm
, & looked out the window to see
orcas
out front! We watched until about
2:45 pm as J's, K's & some of L's passed by heading south in two groups. One small group took a long dive, bunched up, and then headed SW in a resting line. When we returned to the house at

9:15 pm
, we drove up, looked out the window, and were thrilled to luck out to see a pod of ~6 orcas heading north past the house.

At around
0645
this morning I saw what appeared to be 2
dolphins
crossing our bow just off Silva Bay on Gabriola Island BC. I only got 1 brief look at the animals but I am able to write off Harbor and Dall's Porpoise as a possibility as well as Orca. The fin was very hooked but with a rounded tip, I wish I could draw it. It was smoky white in color and was quite large (in comparison with a porpoise) but not big enough to be an Orca. My first thoughts were Pacific White Side (the only marine mammal of these waters I have not seen before) but it looked wrong compared to the pictures and there were only 2 animals, showing no signs of playing with the ship. If anyone has any idea please let me know (via this site). I was a captain in the whale watching industry for 5 years and can normally ID these animals with some ease so this is stumping me!

Thanks to some help from Alana of the BC Cetacean Sighting Network, one of the "mystery" dolphins that was reported earlier this month has been identified as a Risso's dolphin: After following Alana's suggestion to have Mike take a look at photos and illustrations of Risso's dolphins, we received this reply from Mike: I would say that is exactly what I saw.
