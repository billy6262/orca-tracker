Orca Sightings for July 31, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Watched about 12 - 15 members of
J-Pod and K- Pod
pass by Saturna Island in Boundary Pass travelling west, from around

13:30
when they were just East of Boiling Reef to about

16:00
when they reached Monarch Head., ID's on J1, J8, J17, J22, J27, J28, and K26. A calf with orange/pink coloration was among the first to pass by East Point, accompanied by two adults, but the current was too strong for it to keep up, and it ended up at the rear of the pod by the time they reached Monarch Head. Some foraging in the roiling waters of the sill just out east of Boiling Reef where they spent close to an hour before turning back towards Saturna and heading West.

Hearing a few faint [
orca
] calls (S19s?) over rising ship noise on Lime Kiln hydrophone at
2115
.
2130
, Now hearing many calls on Orcasound and Lime Kiln hydrophones. In between ship and boat noise there was a pleasant postprandial serenade this evening, probably from
J and L
pods. I heard many S1s, S2s, an S10, and some S4s and S7s. I uploaded two recordings to the Lime Kiln and Orcasound archives.

Traveled north this
afternoon
into Canadian waters to meet up with the southbound
J-Pod
. Got our first good looks at dorsal fins out at Boiling Reef - with the flooding tide there were some really nice currents, rips and whirlpools out there! The dozen or so Orcas we encountered were in a tight traveling group, slowly making their way against the incoming tide. They traveled towards Saturna Island (the most southerly of the Canadian Gulf Islands) and really hugged the shore as they made their way south. Great looks at who we identified as members of J- Pod. J-27 (Blackberry) was amongst the pod with his mother J-11 (Blossom), aunt J-19 (Sachi) and younger brother J-39 (Mako). It was a beautiful sight; the Orcas moved so gracefully and surfaced to breathe within seconds of each other. Looked as though there was a little resting behavior, then a few spy hops as well as the occasional tail slap or flipper slap.

I observed 15-20
killer whales
at 48 21.3 N 124 45.09 W at
1300
(between Cape Alava and Cape Flattery). The whales were traveling north. It appeared to be members of L Pod. I have attached two sample photos.

Vicki Druge of the Makah Museum called Orca Network to relay a report from some hikers who had just come off the Cape Flattery trail and saw 11 - 14
