Orca Sightings for July 28, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I attach a photo of one of the seven
Transients
that were travelling in waters south of Point Roberts. There was an unusual type of "puncture hole" located behind the saddle patch. It almost looked like a blowhole. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who may have some thoughts about was caused this wound and if it could be life threatening.

My neighbor, Brandy, was out kayaking and spotted the
humpback
very close to her.

We had the opportunity to see a group of
transients
, which we see much less frequently in the area. Captain Mike, naturalist Megan, our guests, and I headed up towards Matia Island to check out a group of seven transient orcas. When we first approached the orcas and other whale watch boats, we could spot T20 in the distance. T20, a male transient orca in his forties, was travelling with six female transients. The T20's (a family group of transients that tend to travel together - T20, T21, and T22) have a interesting story connected to J Pod, one of the three resident pods we see in the islands. Typically, the resident orcas and transient orcas tend to either ignore each other (acting as though they don't notice), or the transients will actively avoid the resident community. No cases of any other kinds of interaction between the two groups was documented until 1993, when 10 J Pod members were spotted off the coast of Descano Bay charging at high speed toward the bay and toward T20, T21, and T22. These three orcas were fleeing from the J Pod members. After the encounter ended, the J Pod members involved in the incident met up with J17 and her newborn calf, J28. This interaction could possibly have been related to the calf, because transients are marine mammal hunters and J Pod could have considered them a potential threat to young J28. However, the exact reason for this apparent attack is unknown. Encounters like this may be related to the transients avoidance of the Southern Resident community. They would surface together and take about three breaths each, then go under for about five to seven minutes at a time. (The Transient/J Pod story was summarized from a depiction of the encounter in Transients: Mammal- Hunting Killer Whales by John B. Ford & Graeme M. Falls.)

A group of seven
transients
were travelling in Washington waters from Rosario Strait to Point Roberts. Based on Lifeforce photographs orca expert Graeme Ellis, Canada Department of Fisheries and Oceans, identified the orcas as T020 (a male est. Birth 1963), T021 (a female est. Birth 1968), T090 (a female Born 1980), T090B (sex unknown, Born 2006), T124 (a female est. Birth 1967), 124D (sex unknown, Born 1996), and 124E (sex unknown, Born 1999). For approximately 30 minutes the transients stayed in the area of a cluster of approximately 10 whale watch boats and a few pleasure craft. It is thought that these clever hunters of the sea may use boats as part of their herding strategy or may find seals and fish hiding by the boats. One Lifeforce photo depicts a harbour seal on the rostrum of one orca later after the boats had departed. And one of these transients has a puncture type wound just behind the saddle patch. Photos can be seen on our website.

Transient orca
T14 was in Haro Strait, and another group of transients were north of Lummi Island. In the Strait of Georgia, just south of White Rock, at about

3:15 pm
, there were 7 transient killer whales slowly making their way north. We did ID T20, a distinctive male. There were 3 females, 2 youngsters, and another that looked like a sprouter? Very triangular dorsal fin. At first they were all together, like a resting formation, but going on long 5 minute or more dives, then coming up far left or right of where they dove, with some bringing their heads out of the water, as if they were making a sweep of the area. They split up 3 to the right, 3 to the left, T20 in the middle, and the hunting drama unfolded. Two of the 3 to the left lunged in unison toward the other group of orcas. Another lunge, a spy hop, T20 milling about. The group to the right, of 2 females with a calf, started going back & forth in the same area when we saw they had something- a baby harbor porpoise. They would take turns with the porpoise, sometimes it was between them, sometimes held in their mouths- hunting lessons for the calf? At about 4pm, when we had to start back, they were still 'playing' with the porpoise. I am having a hard time describing the graceful power, agility, and prowess of these orcas! An encounter I will long remember!

A whole group of
orcas
, as many as 5 or so. There appeared to be a male and a female and some baby orcas, we weren't sure. That was at latitude/longitude 38 degrees 57 minutes N and 123 degrees 50 minutes W at
0800
. That was
30 miles south of Ft. Bragg CA
.

The above report & photos were sent to our Coast Researcher list, and we received this reply with ID's of this pod: Some of these images are clear enough to identify these killer whales as transients that frequent Monterey Bay. They are known to target sea lions and gray whale calves. These images include two males - CA41 and CA44 (a younger sprouter with an extremely distinctive dorsal fin) - who often travel together within a small group. Some of the females are CA46 and probably CA45 (who may be CA44's mother). CA41 was first photographed in
November 1990, while the others were first photographed in
October 1992.

Orca Network received a call from Sandy at the Windjammer Gallery in Coupeville, relaying a report from Brandy who had been sailing in Penn Cove & heard & saw a gray whale swimming mid- cove off Coupeville's downtown at around
4:10 pm. The whale appeared to be heading west, into the cove. Orca Network volunteer Jill Hein went out to try to find and photograph the whale, as we are trying to get ID photos of these late-staying grays. She only saw the whale surface once, at about
5:30 pm near the mussel pier on the far side of Penn Cove, and was able to take the photo above, which looks like a dorsal fin, meaning this likely wasn't a gray, but
possibly a ?humpback?
John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research comments on the photo of the whale in Penn Cove on
July 28: I think it very much does look like a humpback. We got several reports of a humpback whale at the south end of Bainbridge on Sunday evening that then appeared to move east and then apparently north, so could even be that animal.
