Orca Sightings for July 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Belated reporting -
Orcas
cruised past the south end of Lopez

7:30 pm
. Seas were rough. Whales were close to shore. Lots of spyhopping and breaching. Heading west in groups of 2-5.

Another boat from Vancouver called us to say they had found
J-Pod
, right above the top of Lummi! The whales had actually gone briefly to their old routine of the "25 hour circle" around the San Juans. So we didn't have to go far to see J-Pod along with L-57 Faith. Whales were spread in 3-4 groups, and moving along at a fairly good clip. We saw L57, J1, J28, J19 with J41. As the group headed down the Strait, we saw about 8 breaches, a few other surface percussives, but no vocalizations. During the afternoon trip, the whales began slowing down a bit until they passed the Burrows Lighthouse near Anacortes, and began to spread out more. Most of the boats were up with the leaders about 4 miles ahead of us, but we were content hanging back with L57, and a group of 5 J-Pod whales.

We met up with
J's
in Bellingham Channel spread out in the early afternoon. We came down Bellingham Channel with a small group, while other whales went down the west side of Cypress. We continued south with J's and met up with L53, L7 and later L57 who apparently are still hanging out with J pod. We then left them at the north side of Whidbey to check out a
minke
that appeared to be chasing L57 although not sure what was going on! All we saw was L57 suddenly shoot out of the water with the minke surfacing behind him.

Katherine Ayres was with the
southern residents
. The orcas were traveling south in Rosario Strait between the confluence of Bellingham and Guemes Channels (at
2 pm
) and mid-Strait WSW of Deception Pass (at
5 pm
).

As we came out of Peavine Pass, we were quite surprised to see one
minke
whale (confirmed), and sighted a second, much larger cetacean off in the distance (but never found again). It was doing the somewhat typical minke dive ratio of about 4-6 breaths at the surface, and then off on a long dive of 5- 7 minutes.
