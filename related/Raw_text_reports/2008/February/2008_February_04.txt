Orca Sightings for February 4, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The same juvenile
humpback
that I saw on Saturday, 2/2/08, was seen this
afternoon
off of Bellevue Pt. San Juan Island, by Ken Balcomb. I went out to see if I could get a better shot of the underside of the fluke so that it might be identified. It was feeding in erratic directions, so I didn't get the shot I wanted.
