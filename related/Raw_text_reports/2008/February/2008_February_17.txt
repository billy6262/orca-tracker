Orca Sightings for February 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
While fishing off Church Rock at
9 am
this morning, observed a playful pod of 8 to 10
orcas
breaching and tail-slapping between Church Rock and Swordfish Isand at the west end of Whirl Bay (Southern tip of Vancouver Island). They were headed east towards the Race.

J POD
!!!!!!!!!! We located J pod crossing the Oak Bay area(Victoria) bucking a big ebb tide with the help of a on shore whale enthusiast. They were last sighted at
1600
heading for San Juan.

We've had OrcaSound.net on ever since we got the reports of
J pod
heading east. Nothing for an hour or two, then suddenly at about

8:30 pm
a bunch of very loud calls on the OrcaSound (NW San Juan Island) hydrophone - and then - nothing! We're still listening hoping for a few more calls - tune in, & let us know if you hear them tonight, or see them on Monday!
