Orca Sightings for October 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Malleson was with
JKL
in the afternoon off

Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research
*
On both Zodiac trips today we had four
Humpback
whales, just
south and east of Victoria
. They seemed to be circling east and then west at times. A steller sea lion took pleasure in playing with them later this afternoon. All the 'humpies' have been ID from the Humpback Whale catalogue that Mark Malleson has produced.
Marie O'Shaughnessy, Ocean Magic
