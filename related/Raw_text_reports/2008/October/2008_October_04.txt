Orca Sightings for October 4, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just wanted to report that I was able to hear
Orcas
for over 1 1/2 hours at Lime Kiln state parks hydrophone. Since they didn't appear at OrcaSound after this, I guess they are heading south. I didn't get a chanch to record them, though, still it was lovely to hear! First they were very very faint and not so much to hear. But after 45 minutes, boat noise came up, and so did the Orcas! It was so lovely to hear them again! It started
21:59:03 (the faint ones), should be
12.59 PM
over there. The last call I could hear was at
23:06:45 (

14:06
over there).

I just wanted to pass along that
J, K, and L pods
were all on the west side of San Juan Island on Saturday during the big storm. They went up the island all the way to Lime Kiln, then turned and headed back down the island.

A wild, windy grey day out there in the Strait of Juan de Fuca between
12.15- 3pm
. The Ocean Magic travelled south east of Race Rocks and found at least three members of
L pod
taking deep dives. Mega, L41, Ocean Sun L25, and Matia L77 were ID and spread far out.

I was on the

10:30
Blackball sailing out of Victoria. About a half hour out from Victoria we saw two sets of whale watching boats. The first set of 7-8 boats was around two baleen whales that sounded just as we passed (pretty sure these are the
humpbacks
reported in this area - see reports above & below). The second set of two-three whale watching boats were approximately 100 yards south, and following a large male
orca
that appeared to be paralleling the baleen whales. I've never seen these two so close together-it seemed pretty clear there was an interaction unfolding. Hope others have provided additional observations-we kept heading south so lost sight of all within 10 minutes.

The same three
Humpbacks
seen yesterday were seen again today, almost the same place. SE of Victoria.
