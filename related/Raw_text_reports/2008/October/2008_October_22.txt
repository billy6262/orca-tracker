Orca Sightings for October 22, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
On our second trip we observed
K pod
off Middle Bank. It was great to see the little one K42, along side its sibling and the new matriach K 11, Georgia. They seemed to be in a hurry heading out west, but there was time for a breach or two. I forgot to say we saw
L87
right with K pod (see photo). I gather he has been a consistant companion to K pod this summer. Must have a girlfriend in this pod.

Just wanted to give the report for the evening;
K- pod + L-87
travelling WSW from
Middle Bank to 2.5 miles South of Constance Bank
. I left them at
1810
doing 8 kts pointed for Crecent Bay/ Race Rocks area. Lots of socializing, tail lobbing, playing in the kelp, 45 minutes straight of beautiful vocals/ echolocation.

2:20
we had searched McArther Bank, near
Smith Island
, out toward
Hein Bank
, then toward Middle Bank and bingo! Far in the distance orca fins! By

2:40
we were viewing K-11, Georgia and fins started to appear all around, headed west from San Juan Island. The whales spent a lot of time foraging and breaking off into sub family groups. K-26, Lobo was circling around with K-14 Lea and Yoda and the new littlest of the K's. The energetic little whale flashed his tail stock and fluke right in front of us! Rainshadow passed by, and Cali. It was magical to see the whales, as this time of year it is always as if this "might be the last time this season." We left them at approximately
3:30, but I heard on the radio they were east of Discovery at

4:00 p.m.
