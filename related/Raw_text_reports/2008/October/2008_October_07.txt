Orca Sightings for October 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here's a visual/audio report:
J, K and L pods
(or at least members of all three pods) came north past
Lime Kiln lighthouse
. By using my mp3 player with an FM tuner I am really 'plugged in' to the sounds. A small group was approaching, with a calf, a juvenile and an adult. At first they were in close proximity to one another. Then they began to spread out and after a few minutes I realized that the vocalizations I was hearing were becoming more frequent and intense. They were not terribly far apart, within 100 yards of another, but not together and the seas were really rough. The frequency and intensity continued and as they joined back up then intensity and frequency slowed down to a softer and quieter sound (and at that time they were right by the hydrophones in front of the lighthouse). Sure, we know they 'talk' to each other, it is just amazing to see what's going on while they are talking.

I first started hearing very faint [
orca
] calls on
Lime Kiln
hydrophone at

14:40
. They are nice and loud at the moment (
17:00).

At
5 pm
we tuned into the
Limekiln
Hydrophone to wonderful, loud, varied [
orca
] calls! We listened for about 20 - 30 minutes. Then at
6:05 pm - we began to hear great calls at Orcasound! so it sounds like the Southern Residents were heading north up San Juan Island.
