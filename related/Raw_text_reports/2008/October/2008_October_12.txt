Orca Sightings for October 12, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
For the last week, 4-5
humpbacks
have decided to linger at the buffet at
Constance Bank
. A few times the whales would get a bit active and would slap the water with their enormous pectoral fins or tail flukes. The water was absolutely flat, and the backdrop of the Olympic Mountains added to the serenity of the whales interactions.
