We found
L pod
moving along to the east and then to the north and east from off of
Port Angeles, WA
. at approximately
2 p.m
. We quickly got the picture that there were lots of whales, all moving along, with occasional foraging behavior, and some rolling and pec slapping. Soon we were seeing many groups of whales, breaches in the distance, (some very young ones joining in the fun!), and then more and more males started showing up. We easily spotted
J-1, J-27, J-30, and L-57
! We left the pods at

3:15
as they continued aimed almost at
Cattle Pass
in the misty, rainy weather.
