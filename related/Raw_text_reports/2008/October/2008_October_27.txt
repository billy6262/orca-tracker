Orca Sightings for October 27, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
My co-worker, Brenden, saw many
Orcas
about 2 nm to the Southeast of our location (2.5 nm
Southeast of Constance Bank
). Upon investigation, we identified them as
K-pod
. The animals were very spread out milling about 4 nm South of Constance Bank. We left K-pod at
1820
hrs. still spread out headed slowly Southeast as we watched an amazing multi-colored sunset to the West. At the same time we were viewing the
Humpbacks
(
1645
), Simon (Ocean Ecoventures) picked up two male
Transients
3 nm Northwest of our location (Constance Bank). Simon believes the I.D.'s were U38 and U39, which are California Transients. At
1645
hrs. we picked up 3
Humpbacks
2.5 nm Southeast of
Constance Bank
. Among the group included BCY 0160 (Heather) and two others which we did not identify, however, they were X Humpbacks (solid black flukes). The three animals were very active at the surface often bringing their heads right out of the water. Full profile on the tail as they went on their deep dives which lasted approx. 7.5 minutes. At
1750
hrs., on his way home to Cowichan Bay, Simon (Ocean Ecoventures) picked up a large
Minke
Whale 2 nm South of
Trial Island
headed West.
