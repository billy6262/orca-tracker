Orca Sightings for October 25, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Once up by Spieden we heard of humpbacks at Hein Bank, so we headed south to see them. We had a wonderful experience watching two
humpbacks
around
Hein Bank
from

2:30 -
3:30 p.m
. They were slowly surfacing and then doing long dives of about 8 minutes each dive.

The afternoon departure took us East of Victoria into the San Juan's. Two
Humpback
Whales were spotted by Island Explorer III just West of Hein Bank traveling Westwards. After spending 3-4 surfacings with the pair of HB's we left them at
1710
hrs. 2.7 nm SE of Seabird Pt. (Discovery Island) still headed West.

The morning departure took us 46 nm West of Victoria to
Sombrio Beach
(just across from Neah Bay - on the Canadian Side of the Strait). Upon arrival to Sombrio Pt. we encountered 13-15 ft. swells crashing into the shoreline. Absolutely stunning scenery here with massive Sitka Spruce trees and beautiful sand beaches coupled with huge waves crashing into the rocks at Sombrio Pt. Just to the West of Sombrio Pt., at the Western approaches to Sombrio Beach, we encountered 10-12
Gray whales
feeding right in the shallows in the kelp forests. Our encounter lasted from
1200 til 1230 hrs
. Along with the Gray's there were lots of surfers enjoying the huge swells coming in from the West.

I was a stow away on Western Prince today as I just couldn't bear to see the season drawing to an end - so with no sightings we left Friday Harbor and headed north. We knew there were some T's headed north yesterday (10/24), and then heard a sighting at
9:30 a.m. today near Bedwell Harbour (Pender Island). When we headed home (from Hein Bank - humpback portion of report below), about 1/2 way to Cattle Pass, Ivan looked to the shore along San Juan Island and said, "What is that splash?? There shouldn't be a splash there!" With binoculars he soon spotted black fins, headed north on the shore of San Juan Island! Orca! Soon we were able to identify
K Pod
! Many K pod whales were headed
north along San Juan
, porpoising, traveling, and yes, the little K baby was doing a few breaches! L- 87 was also among the K's. We traveled north with the K's from

3:45 -
4:05
. What an incredible ending to our trip today!! We heard later that they had turned south by
4:20 p.m.

Kendall Berry called Orca Network to report
K pod
off
Cattle Pass
, S. San Juan Island, heading north at

3:30 pm
.

At
1710
, from Discovery Island we continued eastwards towards Eagle Pt. where we picked up
K-pod
. They were all grouped together about 2 nm offshore of
Eagle Pt.
heading down island. Lots of breaching and vocals as they played and frolicked all together. We had a very short visit with them as the sun was setting at this point. We left them at
1810
hrs. 2 nm SW of the Salmon Bank marker still headed South. Still no sign of K- 40 or K-21?
