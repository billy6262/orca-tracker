Orca Sightings for October 14, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had the
T41's and T44
, a total of three
Transient
Orca making several kills just off William Head, Metchosin. I was on the Ocean Magic at
noon
. We didn't have to travel far from the
Victoria harbour
to encounter these whales. There were bits of prey items floating along that kept the gulls swooping in. We were also lucky to find one
Humpback
whale, that looked like one of the four that have been seen over the past week in these waters.
