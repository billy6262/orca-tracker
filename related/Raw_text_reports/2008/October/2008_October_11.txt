Orca Sightings for October 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We then encountered three lazy and very restful
Humpback
whales. The same three seen the day before. We even caught site although fleetingly, of the younger of the four that have been hanging out just
south of the Victoria Harbour
for several days now. Great whale watching especially for the Humpbacks in October.

I was out this afternoon, on the Ocean Magic and we had a beautiful pass at the stern from the
T49's
. There was one really small calf and another youngster too swiming along with a total of six Orca.

We rounded Race clockwise, had a good sea lion show and proceeded to take the flood back home. We viewed three if not four
humpbacks
resting on the surface and occasionally diving. That's when one of the whales surfaced what seemed to be very close behind us and headed towards us (about 30m or 100'). We were speechless, then another came up between the first and us, and another, we were literally weak in the knees and our heart rates doubled. These whales were moving so slow and seemed to be following us (we were drifting ever so slowly with the mainsail up), we altered course to try to get out of their way and they altered too, then one of them came up to have a look at us at 10-15' away and did a slow spy hop and hung there, unbelievable. It rolled over on its side and raised up its pectoral fin out of the water and slowly rolled away. The whales slowly passed and we finally got to breath again. I told my friend that this was an experience of a lifetime and we both agreed.
