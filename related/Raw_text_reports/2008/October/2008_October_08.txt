Orca Sightings for October 8, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a very large pod of
Orcas
off the north coast of
Gabriola
and they were heading north. As a guess I would say there were over 50 and some of the younger ones were circling, playing, and catching air. It was about

1:30PM
.

As we rounded Turn Point into
Boundary Pass
, we saw the large wavy and oh-so-distinctive dorsal fin of
J-1 Ruffles
about 300 yards away. It was shortly thereafter that one whale became many, and we were in complete awe. Distinctive blows were sounding from all directions as whales surfaced in groups all across Boundary Pass.

We saw
T 20 and T 21
near
Sooke
Vancouver Island while out on the Ocean Magic at
noon
. These two were heading further west toward Sheringham Lighthouse, when we caught up with them. The three
Humpbacks
, that have been seen for several days were still hanging out just south of the Victoria Harbour.
