Orca Sightings for October 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
1pm
POW Zodiac out of Victoria found two
Humpback
whales today in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
. They were south west of Race Rocks. One was 'kelping' which was fun to watch. These two animals were quite curious about us. After their 3-5 mins deep dives we found them on a couple of occasions, all too close.
