Orca Sightings for December 23, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We reached the lookout at
Lagoon Pt.
at

2:34 pm
, just as
J pod
was passing by heading north! They were VERY spread out, with the leaders at Marrowstone Pt, and the trailers not yet to Lagoon Pt. Most were mid-channel or closer to the other side, but J1 came by close enough to give us a good ID on him. There were some lunges, porpoising, breaches and direction changes that indicated possible foraging. We observed one very tight group of 6 to 8 orcas that surfaced close together and remained on the surface for awhile. They surfaced several more times further north, still traveling in a close group. We left at

3:10 pm
as the trailers were approaching Marrowstone Pt.

There is a small pod of
Orca

Tuesday. Looks like maybe 2 males and one female from what I can see in the middle of the channel.

We think we sighted a single pilot whale with a small dorsal fin off
Lagoon Pt.
today at

10:30am
Heading north. Black in color with no markings and staying up on the surface mostly. (
we have observed a Pseudorca in this area before, which would also fit with this description and behavior - in the past it's been the lone Pseudorca known as Foster or Wilma - sb
)
