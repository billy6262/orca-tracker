Ken Balcomb had ten transients near Victoria BC around

T30, T30A, T30B, T30C, T49A, T49A1, T49A2, T49B, T49B1, T123, and T123A
. They mostly traveled northeast toward Trial Island in their matrilineal groups, grouping occasionally at the sites of three seal kills enroute. The only indication of feeding was gathering of gulls for scraps.
