Orca Sightings for December 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:29 AM. Possible sighting off Alki?
Hard to tell, but from my 8th floor office there seems to be a few large mammals way out beyond the light house splashing about. Could be chop, but if a report from closer by comes in, this is good confirmation. I am in Belltown.
