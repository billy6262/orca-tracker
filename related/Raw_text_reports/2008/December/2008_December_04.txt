Orca Sightings for December 4, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approx
1545hrs
I witnessed
8-10 possibly even 12 Orcas
travelling
south
. My location is in
Powell River British Columbia, Canada
. The Orcas were difficult to count as they were spread out over a vast area. I spoke this morning with a boater who feels there were at least 2 juveniles among them.

While listening in at Lime Kiln, I heard an interesting clanging sound reminiscent of a bell. And then a slight squeek. I turned up the volume and listened more intently, and heard a vocalization that sounded kind of like a cross between a humpback and an orca. Then it got louder, and I realized it was
vocalizations
from
RESIDENTS
that were very far away, and I was picking up echoes, which gave it a longer duration. Soon I was clearly picking up
J calls, K calls, and a few L's.
So I called to Jeanne, who happened to be out on the west side, and she confirmed that residents were several miles off shore, heading from San Juan Island towards Discovery. Those guys sure did some swimming, as they were also spotted at Turn Point lighthouse at

9:00 AM
. So they must have gone from Seattle yesterday, probably up Rosario (and maybe to the Fraser River?), and then back down Boundary and out towards Discovery Island.
