Orca Sightings for December 10, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
There's an orca sighting in the email below, by a reliable observer who does a lot of seawatches. The message came from a birding email list (OBOL), but there is an orca sighting at the end. Boiler Bay is very near the town of
Depoe Bay, OR
.
