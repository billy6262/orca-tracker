Orca Sightings for December 29, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately

4:15 p.m
. from the Island Packers whale watch boat out of Channel Islands Harbor in
Oxnard, California
. We saw several
Orca
including males on both sides of the boat traveling west along the south side of East Anacapa Island of the Channel Island chain at approximately 34 degrees N by 119 degrees W. The school of Orca were trailing a large school of several hundred common dolphin first sighted at approximately 4 p.m. swimming west rapidly past both sides of our boat. The crew explained that they have seen Orca only once before in this area, and their presence could explain the absence of the gray whale they had sighted on their morning excursion to the same area that day.

On the

1:30 p.m.
Whale Watch trip with Island Packers out of
Channel Islands Harbor CA
saw
6 Transient Orcas
on the southside of Anacapa Island traveling west about 1/4 of a mile behind a large pod of Common Dolphins. They didn't seem to be in a hurry to catch up to one of them and make a meal. We spent about 30 minutes with them till they passed our boat; the Islander from Island Packers.
