Orca Sightings for December 2, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on the

1:10
ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle today, when we encountered a pod of perhaps
15 Orcas
accompanied by two small "escort" boats of biologists. The view was spectacular, even from the ferry and they were very active on the surface!

The whales turned back north about
5 PM
after spending at least 8 hours in south Puget Sound, according to Amy Carey on Vashon Island, as relayed by Jeff Hogan. We're monitoring the Port Townsend hydrophones but so far have heard no calls. After spending the day with the NW Fisheries Science Ctr. shooting ID photos, Jeff Hogan called with sightings of
J's, K's and L7, L53 and L87
. Jeff said the whales were often in resting lines but also milled and foraged, and changed direction often, as evidenced by the many reports throughout the day. Hopefully they found enough chum salmon to fill up on.

orcas
between Blakely Rock and Tyee Shoal, about 1/4 mile east of the ferry route.

A large pod of
Orcas
has been spotted heading
south
from near Bainbridge and is now in between Vashon Island and West Seattle near the ferry lanes. That was about

10:50 am
today. Just went down to Point Robinson on Vashon. Heard that they turned around and headed back North after West Seattle. I guess I missed them this time.

the captain of the Ferry Issaquah called to say
orcas
were milling near the Fauntleroy dock.

Brandy Chapin emailed: My husband is on the

10:20am
Faunt/Southworth ferry. The captain announced and he saw a pod of
orcas
. There appeared to be at least 5 different whales. They were remaining somewhat
SW of Alki Point
and traveling in an easterly direction originally and are now in a NW direction. They appear very active and look to be feeding. The one male was off from the other four (females), who were almost in a line. The male appeared to be herding salmon down to the others.
*
A co-worker coming in to Seattle from Bainbridge said she saw a few
killer whales
from the ferry. Also, I just received a similar report via e-mail (below).
