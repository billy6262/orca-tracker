Orca Sightings for December 31, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found myself riding alongside Captain Ivan out in
Haro Strait
. And lo and behold,
2 orcas
show up!!! We were shocked to say the least. A closer peek found us looking at very familiar dorsal fins--- Transients
T20 & T21
! They weren't in a big hurry, coming to the surface for 4-6 breaths, and then a long dive. We watched them travel from about
Gooch Island
to the bottom of Sydney Island before we had to head back. A great way to end 2008!!
