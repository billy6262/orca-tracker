Orca Sightings for January 6, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We are a family that lives on Vashon Island on the water near Dolphin Point (Glen Acres). We were lucky enough to see the
Orca
headed South around

10:30 AM
. We then went down to Point Robinson and to our delight , they came very close to shore (100 yrds?).

Spotted a pod of
orca
swimming south between the ferry docks of Pt Defiance and Vashon at approximately

2:30
. I personally counted 5 while another person said there were 10. They swam south past the ferry dock towards the end of Pt Defiance and then turned around and headed North, swimming directly in front of and underneath the ferry. In the group I spotted one very large dorsal fin and one young orca.

12:05 p.m.
