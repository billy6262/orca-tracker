============================================================

Entry 1:
We were alerted that KING 5 TV's website has posted some GREAT orca footage:
Orcas near Gig Harbor
This looks like K pod doing some active feeding & playing! sb
And more confirmation on the ID of the orcas in the video:
That's great Susan. Looks like
K pod (including L87)
to me. Some nice stuff of L87 and K21 messing around. Thanks,

I was in Bremerton today when someone called with a sighting of the
gray whale
. I found it at the entrance of Port Washington Narrows about mid channel. It was taking 2-3 breaths followed by ~3 minute dives, and stayed in the same area for the entire hour I observed. I did get some distant photographs and have attached a few here.

Gray whale
in Bremerton - from Kitsap Sun's Christoper Dunagan's Watching our Water Ways Blog: A sighting of a
gray whale
in Bremerton this week meets both criteria. The animal was still in downtown Bremerton this morning, swimming around near the end of the destroyer Turner Joy.
