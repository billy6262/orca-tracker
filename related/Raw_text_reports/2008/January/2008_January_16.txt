Orca Sightings for January 16, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I work in the 3131 Western Ave building, and I just spent about 10 minutes watching a pod of
Orcas
playing in Elliott Bay. I was using a telescope, but I'm not a whale expert so I can't offer much more information than the fact that there were about 6 orcas, and it appeared that there were about four larger fins (adults?) and about two smaller fins (juveniles?). They are still out there (it's currently

10:01 A.M.
), between the downtown waterfront and West Seattle (currently closer to the downtown side). It looks like they're playing and feeding. I'm so excited because I've been working in this building for a year and a half, and this is my first sighting! This made my day. Thanks very much for your great work,
Deb Hardy, Seattle

Amy Carey of Vashon Island relayed some additional reports she received of the
Transient
pod as they headed south this afternoon. They were observed going south past Pt. Robinson, east Maury Island, in the early afternoon; from

3:30 - 4 pm
they were off Gold Beach in the Maury Island Preserve heading south, but another report soon afterward had them heading north.

Orca Network received a call from John Fortin at

3:25 pm
, reporting a male & female
orca
off Double Bluff, west Whidbey Island, heading north.

We jumped in the car & headed over to Bush Pt. after receiving the above report, and we found the
orcas
at

4:07 pm
off the entrance to Hood Canal. They unfortunately stayed on the other side of Admiralty Inlet so we didn't get any close looks, but we were able to shoot some video. There were 4 orcas - 2 adult males, 1 sprouter & a female. They continued NW in Admiralty Inlet, closer to the other side. We left them at
4:40 pm, just south of Ft. Flagler, swimming in a line not far offshore. The entire time we watched them, we also were watching small groups of Harbor Porpoise all across the Inlet - the orcas must have been well fed because we didn't witness any of the porpoise becoming dinner!

Orca Network sent stills from the video we took to see if anyone could ID any of these whales (though it was from a LONG distance away!) - here's what Dave Ellifrit has to say: I will go out on a limb here and say that the one bull does indeed have all the looks of T87. Mallard had him and T88 over a week ago with the T124's and T90's so I would not doubt that that group could be bopping around (& as noted above, T124 was ID'd in Jeff Hogan's shot of the T's off Alki). I'll go out on an even bigger (smaller?) limb and say that the other big bull looks like T93. That's about the best I can do. Good catch and send them up here! Cheers,

I just wanted to let you know that I am watching
orcas
in Elliot Bay from my office window,

10:00am
. I have never seen them this far into Elliot Bay. They are on the west side of Elliot bay, southwest of the Ferry Route, closer to the Alki side, down where there are some cargo ships moored out in the bay. It's now

10:38 am
and it looks like they have moved south and west around the point at Alki. There was a helicopter very high above them for a little while so I'm guessing it might have been one of the news stations.

A pod of
Orca
passed Alki point heading south at app.

10:30
this morning. Don't know which pod but I would estimate 10-15 individuals, without an obvious adult male. They were travelling quickly, with long periods (and distance) underwater. I first saw them 10 minutes earlier passing SW close to Alki Beach, appearing to be coming from Eliiot Bay.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales in Seattle called at

11:05 am
to report seeing the pod of
orcas
just south of Alki Pt, south of Elliott Bay, Seattle. He saw ~9 orcas, no males present, & identified them as Transient orcas. He called again at
11:30 am to report they had just disappeared - when he saw them they weren't traveling in any direction - he did get some photos so we hopefully will have some ID's on them soon.
