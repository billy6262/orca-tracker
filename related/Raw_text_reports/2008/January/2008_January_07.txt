Orca Sightings for January 7, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Luann Fortin called at
10 am
to report a pod of
orcas
off Mutiny Bay, headed north toward Bush Pt, Whidbey Island. She said they were very spread out, the pod included several males & a female with a calf

After receiving the call about
orcas
heading north toward Bush Pt, west Whidbey Island, I headed over to the west side of the island & caught up with them from the beach just south of Bush Pt. at

10:50 am
. They were mid-channel at first, then headed closer to the other side - I saw 2 males & several females, at one time I saw 5 females surface together, so my guess is there were at least 7 - 8+ orcas, but they were spread out & distant so difficult to be sure. I watched from Bush Pt. until
11:20, then headed north & watched from the bluff above Lagoon Pt, where I watched them continue north at
11:35, very close to the opposite shore & just south of Ft. Flagler State Park. By
12:18 they had passed Marrowstone Pt, & were traveling in a tighter group half way across Pt. Townsend Bay. At
12:30 pm they turned & headed SE back to Marrowstone Pt & toward Ft. Flagler, but at
12:45 pm they turned again & continued on in a N/NW direction, so far away it was difficult to see them even in the scope. I tracked them back across Port Townsend Bay, & left them just N of the tip of Pt. Wilson at about
1:15 pm.

I just watched a pod of
orca
pass Bush Point heading North. It was a good sized pod, spread out in mid-channel. The whales were moving at a good pace. Two whales breached near a passing (southbound) sailboat that was moving under power. The pod included at least one large male and a number of females. They passed by
between
10:50 and
11:10 am
.
