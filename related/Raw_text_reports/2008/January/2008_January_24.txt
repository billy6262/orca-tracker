Orca Sightings for January 24, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Erin Falcone and I conducted one of Cascadia Research's Westport surveys. Despite the clear skies, we had marginal sighting conditions due to some strong southeasterly winds. Our sightings included a few southbound
gray whales
, 2 harbor porpoise and a group of 6 or 7
transient (orcas)
. The photos have been sent to the Center for Whale Research, DFO and a few others to confirm ID's - so far, Dave Ellifrit of CWR has ID'd two (CA26, and CA36) and a possible on CA33 with a mark change. I'll let you know if we get more ID'd.
