Orca Sightings for January 13, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amy at the Whale Museum just forwarded us this amazing report of
L pod
in Rosario Strait:

9:45-
10:15 am
. Location: Rosario Strait between Burrows Island and Bird Rocks (just SW of Anacortes). 12 to 20 orcas, but could not see much to the south as the sun was shining (for a change), stretched out about 2 miles east to west and Â½ to 1 mile north to south, moving south at about 8 mph. Every now and then they would circle around in one spot. Pod was spread out with a couple of small groups; three females with a juvenile, two females, a male and a female, and others within a couple hundred yards of each other. There were at least three males with very tall dorsal fins, one appeared to angle slightly forward and the two in the photos, which I am pretty sure were different ones. At one point we stopped and were watching several swim by a couple hundred yards away when all of a sudden the male in the close-up picture surfaced near us zig- zagging and making sharp circles as if chasing fish.

L57 report clarification: This clarification is in regard to the report of L pod in Rosario Strait Jan. 13th: I felt compelled to quickly drop you an email so as not to start any false rumors. Jeannie here at TWM reminded me that it's not unusual for L-57 to travel alone with J-pod (as he did many times during the winter of 2006 I believe). As such, I feel I was erroneous in stating that it was L-pod spotted in Rosario. It could have just as easily been J-pod with L-57 traveling with them - I guess it would have more accurate for me to state that L-57 was the only whale ID'd in the group.
