Orca Sightings for January 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a frustratingly late call of [
orcas
] that were heading up past Maple Bay in the
morning
, but we did not get the report until about three o'clock. We managed to race down and get a few quick id's before dark, but that's all. It was a group of transients including T124's, T124A's and T090's, 9 in total.
