Orca Sightings for January 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on the

1:40
ferry leaving San Juan Island. We were blessed with about 6
orca
in San Juan Channel. They were pretty far way, so I could not ID any them, but there was one big male. They were in a tight group and one spy hopped.

Orca Network received a call from Wendy Demeter, reporting 6+
orcas
off west Vashon Island, heading north in Colvos Passage near Cove at

9:30 am
, closer to the Vashon side.
*
Around
noon
, my wife and I were kayaking out of Shilshole Bay near the shipping lane and sighted 2 male
orcas
, and at least 1 female and 1 baby, maybe two of each, but couldn't confirm they were not the same pair. One of the males came very close to us (about 40-50') and was quite beautiful. I did get this picture but not close enough for identifiable details. The whales were heading South at a moderate pace. They did split off with one of the males coming closer to the east side of the lane, and 1 female and baby actually went into the bay area behind us and worked their way over to West Point Lighthouse. The other male was farther out in the shipping lane heading south.

At around
noon
or so today, New Years Day, we were coming from Port Orchard to Shilshole Marina in our boat and when we were west of Elliott Bay, but in the main basin of Puget Sound, we saw
orcas
. There were about six that we saw....there may have been more. Re gender, I think we saw two males, in distance, then two females nearer us, and what looked like a female and calf also nearer us. They were swimming south. It looked like the two females may have been feeding for a bit - they weren't going in a particular direction and were surfacing more, blowing a fair amount, but then they joined the others, heading south.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report
K pod
in Elliott Bay, heading south at
1 pm
.

Found the fins off Dilworth at about

4:30 pm
. Spread out with the closest whale being about 100 feet from shore. Traveling South but Moving slowly. Went to Point Robinson and waited and waited and waited in the dark. I left the beach at about
6:15 and Lynne Brevig, who had been at the beach all day hoping for an Orca sighting called me at

6:25 pm
to say that they were passing the Point.

Today I made a trip over to Vashon/Maury Islands to look for the Orcas. I scanned the horizon all day waiting for Orcas to pass by Pt. Robinson. Alas, no luck. At
4:00 p.m I was about to leave when Amy Carey called to tell me that about 12 Orcas had just passed Dilworth and were heading South. So I waited until after dark. Amy joined me and we both waited and watched the dark horizon at Pt. Robinson. At about

6:00 p.m.
we both called it quits. Amy left and while I was still in the parking lot, I heard blows. From the beach South of Pt. Robinson, I saw 3 fins somewhat close in. The [
orcas
] travelling straight through with no time to stop and visit. Two big male fins.
Lynn Brevig of Seattle

We received a call from Monte Hughes of Mystic Sea Charters, reporting a pod of about 5
orcas
southbound off President's Pt, south of Kingston at

11:10 am
this morning. He had a New Year's Eve charter last night, & while watching the fireworks they heard orcas in Commencement Bay just after midnight!

K-Pod

11:30 AM
