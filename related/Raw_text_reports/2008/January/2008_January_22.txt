Orca Sightings for January 22, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

2:30 pm
, from the viewpoint on marine avenue Powell River BC I observed 4
Orcas
. I first saw them about 800 yds off the ferry terminal. They were traveling south down the Malaspina straits toward Grief Point in a very leisurely manner. They were surfacing every 20 to 30 yards. I watched them for some 20 minutes using X10 binoculars. There was one very large finned Orca. There was one Baby, Very small fin. then one with a fin one half to two thirds the size of the big one. The fourth one had a very slightly larger fin but it had a very distinctive kink at the top 18 inches or so. They stayed in the same order the whole time I watched them. They traveled about a mile or slightly more in that time. They did not appear to be feeding and they were not in any hurry to go anywhere.I hope this is useful, Kind Regards,

A couple of sightings for your records, actually rare sightings in this area, which is on Malaspina Strait about a mile west of Secret Cove. In the first week of January, two or three [
orcas
] passed heading south into Welcome Passage. I cannot be more precise, as they were perhaps a mile off and I caught only one fleeting glimpse before they dove and did not surface again within sight. They were traveling in loose association with Pacific whitesided dolphins - loose because the dolphins seemed to be keeping their distance, staying many hundreds of yards from the orcas. Whether this means the orcas might have been transients, who's to say? The dolphins were so widely scattered, I couldn't begin to estimate their numbers. Last Tuesday (Jan 22), what appeared to be the same pod returned, heading west. This time they were much closer, so that I could make out a female and quite small calf, plus a third animal which was most likely a half- grown male, as the fin seemed too narrow at the base for a female. No dolphins this time.
