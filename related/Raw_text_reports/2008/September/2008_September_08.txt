Orca Sightings for September 8, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our first day on the water this trip, working with
J-pod and some of L's
. We collected 2 prey samples and 2 fecal samples, A good start to the project. The Center for Whale Research boat was also out working with us. We both had PBS film documentary crews onboard for a project that is to be a two-hour film running nationwide on the weekly PBS documentary program FRONTLINE next spring.

Orca Network received a call today from Greg Marcello, reporting ~15
orcas
.5 miles in the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Tatoosh Island, heading toward Makah Bay, off Neah Bay at
noon
. The pod included 1 male and 3 calves, they appeared to be feeding in an area where he was fishing. The photos were forwarded on to several researchers, so far we've heard back from Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research that he would "guess they are
Northern Residents
".

Center staff encountered
J pod with L57, L53 and L7
milling off Pile Point (48 28.757 N; 123 06.258 W) at

10:02 a.m
. The whales were spread out in groups and apparently foraging. J40 was observed catching a salmon, as seen in the above photograph. The encounter ended at

12:20
off Hannah Heights (48 30.153 N; 123 08.996 W). The whales had begun traveling north, still spread out in groups. The J's and the three L's reportedly continued north up to Point Roberts.

Margaret Fleter called Orca Network to report 4 whales below the bluff, in the kelp beds at Dungeness Spit from 8 am - 2 pm. She said they had no dorsals & looked scaly (sounded like gray whales to us). These photos were taken along the bluffs of the Dungeness Spit (Sequim WA) at about

8:45 am
. They are grays!

On the afternoon trip, we were fortunate enough to catch up with the
Residents
from J-Pod along with a few L's. Lots of foraging behaviors with some speed-swimming, multiple direction changes. Vocals were minimal, and seemed to be mainly L-Pod S calls. L57 Faith, the honorary J-Pod whale was definitely checking out all the current lines looking for salmon. As the whales moved closer to Pender Island, J26 Mike did a beautiful breach that had all our Elderhostel charter oohing and ahhing. Couple all this with views of Dalls Porpoise, Harbor Porpoise, Bald Eagles, flat calm water, sunny skies, and you have the perfect September whale outing! We decided to go north and then meet them (So. Residents) somewhere maybe near Kellett Bluff. But they stalled out, so we kept our eyes open for a group of transients that had been reported earlier that morning. So we weren't too surprised to find a group of
transients
near Kelp Reef (or properly it would be Kelp Reefs). As we approached cautiously (transients are so well known for their erratic travel patterns), we realized that we were once again observing T18 and T19's. T19B is so distinctive with his huge, floppy dorsal fin! They seemed so content to just hang out in this area, making circles and rolling on top of one another. T18 earned the nickname of "Slappy" today as almost every surfacing she did, she ended with a huge tail slap. She was hanging out about 200 yards from the other 3. We wondered if perhaps this was some sort of diversionary hunting tactic since she did it so often. Soon the whales discovered a harbor seal amongst the kelp, and a few short lunges later, the seal became a meal. Afterwards there was one spyhop, but no vocalizations.

Summer has returned with the
Resident
Orcas! We encountered
J pod
off of Henry Island northbound crossing to Stuart Island this afternoon. Last night (9/7) we heard a report the Residents were sighted inbound, from their 3 day stint out in the open Pacific Ocean. J pod was spread out moving at a steady pace, with J2 Granny and J1 Ruffles leading the group when we first met up with them. They were spread out in their subpods, or family lines - a little playful action with some breaching and tailslaps. Ruffles did a belly roll too! As they passed Turn Point, Stuart Island there were lots of spyhops as if to check on each other and make sure they were all going the right way! Just off of Turn Point we also saw some Dall's Porpoise slicing through the water.
