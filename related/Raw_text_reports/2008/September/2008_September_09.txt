Orca Sightings for September 9, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
The Gray whales were here (Dungeness Spit) again. Also, some visitors reported to our volunteers that they saw the dorsals of
Orcas
here as well. We originally saw 4 Grays, including what we thought was a much smaller whale with this group. Then they disappeared and now there is only the one.

There was a small pod of
Orcas
that visited the Port Angeles Wa harbor, and headed East down the coast line towards Sequim and on, from
1400 - 1700
. There were at least 1 single male, in Port Angeles I did see 2 males and 2 females, then as they past further down the strait, there were 1 male and 4 females. I have some pictures of them, there were 5 to 6 in all.

PORT ANGELES - A pod of three orcas made a rare trip Tuesday afternoon into Port Angeles Harbor, trailed by about a dozen boats of whale watchers. The marine mammals arrived at about 2 p.m. and were headed back into the Strait of Juan de Fuca two hours later. Observers on land called the Coast Guard Group/Air Station Port Angeles and the Port Angeles Police Department, concerned that the boats had driven the orcas into shallow waters or had trapped them there. But Coast Guard Operations Specialist First Class Ian Banks said the crew of a helicopter that was detoured over the area saw no boats within the 100-yard no- encroach zone set by the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act. A Coast Guard patrol boat also was sent to the area off the Rayonier pier to enforce both the no-encroach zone and a 400-yard no-wake zone that requires boats to reduce speed. Most, if not all, the boats were operated by professional whale tour operators from Canada, Banks said. Rich Osborne, former director of the Whale Museum of Friday Harbor, now a Clallam County employee, said the orcas could have been hunting fish or seals. "In either case, they were probably exploring," he said. Osborne said orcas observed on the Strait side of Ediz Hook probably are hunting fish. Closer to shore, they may hunt weaner harbor seals, animals newly independent of their mothers and easy prey for orcas, also called killer whales. Orcas are either fish eaters or marine mammal eaters, according to Howard Garrett of Whidbey Island, co-founder of Orca Network. Garrett said a pod of orcas had been spotted near Port Angeles on Saturday and near Dungeness Spit on Thursday. Banks said that, besides staying 100 yards from an orca, observers should approach them only from the side, not from in front of them or behind them. He said this warning, and more cautions about observing orcas and other marine mammals, can be found in the pamphlet, "Be Whale Wise." It and other information about orcas can be found at the Orca Network Web site, www.orcanetwork.org. The site includes both a link to report orca sightings and accounts of recent sightings, plus links to photos, books and other marine mammal organizations.

Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Erin Heydenreich and Mackenzie Consoer of the Center for Whale Research received a report from Captain Pete on the Odyssey of
J's and L's
traveling southwest in Boundary Pass at
3:00. The center staff responded and encountered J pod as well as L57, L53, and L7 traveling south at Turn Point (48 41.173 N; 123 14.718 W) at

4:02 p.m
. The whales were very spread out and traveling at a medium pace down Haro Strait. Due to the calm conditions, the Center was able to continue the aerial photogrammetry contract work with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The encounter ended at

6:10
just outside Snug Harbor (48 34.068 N; 123 11.764 W). The whales continued to travel south, spread out from Henry Island to Bellevue Point.

Transient Orcas
at Port Angeles heading west. We decided to head north. As we headed towards Vancouver Island we came across several Dall's porpoise rooster tailing in Haro Straight. Found
J-pod and company
heading SW at Blunden Island. We headed up into Boundary Pass and were honored to see J2 "Granny" and J1 "Ruffles" leading the group towards Turn Point. We caught site of L57, L7 and lots of small tight groups heading towards Turn Point. We went ahead to the west side of Turn Point to watch the Whales come around. J27 suspiciously swimming on his side at the surface with a female's fluke facing his!!!!, great orca vocalizations.
