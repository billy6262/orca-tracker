============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, Erin Heydenreich and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research staff encountered
J's, K's and L's
at

4:43 p.m.
, at Turn Point (48 40' 58.44 N; 123 14' 19.68 W). The whales had been coming down from Point Roberts since mid morning. They were spread out across the strait traveling south. Staff observed whales milling, as well as social and tactile behavior. The encounter ended one and a half miles west of Mitchell Bay (48 34' 22.08 N; 123 11' 38.40 W) at

6:40 p.m.
The whales began porpoising south, still spread out in groups.

Orca Network received a call at

4:30 pm
from Marilyn on the Windwalker - they saw a pod of ~15
orcas
in Boundary Pass, between Stuart Island & Bedwell Harbor (between N. & S. Pender Islands) heading east to west, likely heading toward the west side of San Juan Island. A few large males & a calf were seen - they were spread out over 1 mile, with some breaching, tail- lobbing, then they re-grouped & went into travel mode.

We met up with members of
J, K, and L pods
just east of East Point on Saturna Island. They were spread out between Saturna Island and the middle of Boundary Pass. The interesting thing about the groups, was that they were initially divided into male groups and female groups. We got a spectacular look at a group of calf-bearing females and young females all traveling together inshore. This group had around thirteen members and included mother-calf pairs of J19 (Sachi) and J41 (Eclipse), J16 (Slick) and her two youngest calves J42 and J36 (Alki), L72 (Racer) and her son L105 (Fluke), K14 (Lea) with her two youngest K36 (Yoda) and K42. This group also included J31 (Tsuchi) and J28 (Polaris). The group was mostly comprised of females and I was happy to see J28 in the mix - could she be being groomed for motherhood by the other females? I sure hope so. She's fifteen years old and at the age of having her first calf. We also saw some of the boys hanging out together: J30 (Riptide), K26 (Lobo), J1 (Ruffles) and L57 (Faith). Towards the end of our encounter (around
3:30 pm) they seemed to join up in more mixed groups. We left them in the middle ouf Boundary Pass toward the east end of South Pender Island.

All
pods
stayed in Canada overnight and passed Point Roberts in the morning heading South East. Unlike other days with lots of activity they were just travelling through with a few tail slaps and breaches. One male logged near the Lighthouse Marine Park but quickly moved on with the others.
