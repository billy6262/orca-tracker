Orca Sightings for September 13, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

12:43 p.m.
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Stefan Jacobs and Mackenzie Consoer of the Center for Whale Research encountered some members of
L pod
traveling southeast a few miles off Cattle Point (48 40.161 N; 123 14.941 W). The whales were spread out in loose groups mostly milling and traveling toward the south or Rosario Strait. The groups encountered were the
L2's, L4's and L47's
. The Center vessel, Orca, continued to coordinate with a helicopter to conduct aerial photogrammetry surveys. The encounter ended at

2:31 p.m
. with the whales traveling north up Rosario Strait (48 45.477 N; 123 18.480 W).

Watched 6
transients
in
Monterey Bay CA
have some odd interactions with 3 young California Sea Lions and 2 huge Humpback Whales! The sea lions seemed to be watching the Orcas swimming in some very relaxed synchronized exercises that would make Olympic athletes jealous. They didn't appear injured or concerned, just curious. After we had watched for over a half hour, however, things changed. The Orcas began to charge the sea lions and bat them around, but not bite them; it appeared that they might be teaching the young one in the group how hunting worked. There was no blood, and the sea lions showed no external wounds when they swam close. After nearly another half hour two
humpbacks
that had been a couple miles away suddenly appeared right in the middle of things! They seemed to be actually swimming right at the Orcas and occasionally trying to swat them with their tails. Periodically they would dive and be down for 3-5 minutes, then come back up right in the middle of things again.
Later
: Could have been 7 or maybe 8, hard to tell for sure, as they were pretty active most of the time. There was one male that appeared to be about the size of the one from the earlier encounters, the one smaller whale that I think was male, but was so small it was hard to be sure, at least for me. Noel Flores, captain of Sanctuary Cruises, said that just a couple days before this trip he had been watching this same group of Orcas trying to separate a humpback calf from its mother. While they watched, several other humpbacks converged on the action and drove the Orcas off. Seems like the humpbacks are "mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any more!"

One of Steve's photos from the 13 September killer whale encounter shows transients CA51 and CA138. These adult females often travel together. They have been known to engage in what appears to be extended "training lessons", demonstrating attack behavior involving sea lions. The CA51 matriline is composed of 5 whales from 3 generations, including a 5-year-old juvenile. CA138 has a small calf who was born last year, so there were most likely 7 killer whales present. CA138 has also been traveling with that juvenile male. If all were there this would be a sighting of 8. This is truly a VERY interesting encounter that Steve reports here! Richard Ternullo of Monterey Bay Whalewatch described to me very similar behavior that he had observed at least twice in the past several weeks. Possibly it is the same killer whales or humpback whales that are repeating this very odd behavior
