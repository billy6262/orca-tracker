Orca Sightings for September 3, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We heard it was confirmed the Resident Orcas were westbound for the Pacific Ocean. No J,K,L pods. Next a report from another captain -
Ts
off to the south, somewhere off of Hein Bank. We met up with a group of
11-16 Transient Orcas
. A "superpod" if you will, made up of the T18s, T46s, and T30s. From what I heard via other captains and what I saw - the 2 males were T19B (a 13 year old with a large dorsal that leans to the left) and T30A (22 year old male). These 2 males were cruising around separated from the rest of the group. Maybe a little male bonding time? The others included the T46 pod - and T46 is a grandmother again with new baby T46B2! And this little one is very active! Lots of spyhops and breaches. The group as a whole was very active, milling about and changing direction, no real place to be, a little logging as well. We were also fortunate enough today to listen to the Transients vocalizing! I've never heard Transients "live". They sound incredibly different than the Residents. The calls were loud "MeeeOWWS." The encounter got better, which is hard to believe, as we witnessed an Orca hunting-training session. A Common Murre (a diving bird) was sitting at the surface, the T46s and T18s pass beneath the bird. All of a sudden we see the Common Murre try to take off, as if it was being chased, much like a jumping baitfish would! It was hopping on the surface, as if tip-toeing on hot coals - but couldn't quite take off to fly. Then one Orca did a breach/cartwheel as it chased and landed right where the Murre had been. The bird was fine and swam off, lucky that it was not a pre-dinner snack. Probably a little training session for the younger calves and baby. Interestingly enough, the hydrophone was in and the Orcas had become somewhat silent compared to earlier - a little sneak attack on the bird?
