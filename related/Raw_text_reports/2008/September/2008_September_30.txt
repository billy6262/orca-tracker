Orca Sightings for September 30, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here's a grey sighting on Freshwater Bay west of Port Angeles from our contractor building our cabin there just west of the Elwha River off Place Road. "I thought you'd like to know, we did a little whale watching from your new cabin today! As I glanced out the window frame, a very large gray whale was breeching the surface and leaping high into the air. We figure it was only 1000 yards from the beach, very visible, and it did it for about 20 min.

The description of how this whale is behaving sounds more like a
humpback
than a gray whale - though grays will sometimes breach into the air, it's something they RARELY do up in these waters (more likely to see that when they are down south in their mating/birthing lagoons). Since a humpback was sighted in the Strait of Juan de Fuca Sept. 28th, & again in Admiralty Inlet Oct. 3rd, I wouldn't be surprised if this was possibly a humpback. But there also was a gray sighted off Seiku on the 29th - so without a photo, we can't be sure. See our report from Sept. 29th for two great photos showing flukes of a gray whale & a humpback. sb

Saw these
orcas
on Tuesday right near Sandy Hook, feeding and heading north past Useless Bay. There were probably around 30 - ? It seemed like 3 different groups.

The photos sent were of Southern Resident orcas, all three pods were present when we also saw & photographed the same whales (see above photo) - Susan & Howard

8:45 AM
- At least a half dozen
orcas
were heading south down Puget Sound. They were heading south down and looked to be in the north bound shipping lane (approximately 47 degrees 50 minutes, halfway between Scatchet Head - Whidbey and Kingston). Most were traveling, but there were occasional tail slaps and occasional quick turns. Some of them must be large because I saw them from my house which is about four miles away.

9:30 AM
They are still there and moving north again.

We gathered our binocs, camera & video cam & headed for the west side of Whidbey Island. We first stopped at a road end off Mutiny Bay, where we immediately started seeing fins & blows, at

11:05 am
. The whales were closer to the Kitsap Peninsula side, between Pt. no Point & Foulweather Bluff, traveling north. There were whales everywhere we looked - many large, tight groups, with tail lobs, spy hops, direction changes, & lunges indicative of foraging. We saw at least 6 males and counted over 30 whales within the leading groups, & it became apparent we had all three pods traveling together - yippee!! By

11:50 am
, the trailers were at Foulweather Bluff, & the leaders were heading over closer to the Whidbey side, so we headed up to Bush Pt. where they typically like to come in close to shore. From about noon to

12:50 pm
, we watched from Bush Pt. as they passed by, many of them within 50' of the beach! They continued north, still foraging & active, some direction changes, but moving faster than they had been earlier. At

12:50 pm
, the leaders were approaching Lagoon Pt, though more into mid-channel, still heading north. At 1 pm we observed a small research boat come on scene. By
1:30 pm, the trailers were off Lagoon Pt, mid-channel, with the leaders between Port Townsend & Admiralty Head. They were getting more difficult to watch from shore, and all our batteries had run down, so we headed for home, thinking they were on they way either up to the San Juans or back out the Strait. But at
2:17 pm we began to hear faint calls on OrcaSound's Port Townsend hydrophone. Then the calls just kept getting louder - by

3:10
they were quite loud, & we got a call from the Center for Whale Research that orcas had been seen by someone on the Keystone ferry at
3:30 pm, in the same place we had observed them heading north at
1:30 pm! .

We were out working today in Windmill Heights on Whidbey Island, in between Mutiny Bay and Bush Point and saw about 25
orcas
headed north. It was about

11:30 am
. They were feeding as they went, I think on salmon. They traveled in groups of about 2 to 5 individuals, at least two small ones with the adults.

Sue Morrow Flannagan called at

12:30 pm
to report many
orcas
, including large males, were off Bush Pt. where she had been fishing (& was now gleefully whale watching)!
*
I sighted a large number of
Orcas
in front of my house. First noticed large number (estimate 50 plus) travelling north between Lagoon Point on Whidbey Island (I live at the north end of Lagoon Point) and Fort Flagler/Port Townsend. First sighted at

1:20 pm
. Continued observing large population travelling north until about
1:50 pm. Some possibly appeared to be feeding while most appeared to be heading north. I quit counting after 25. The group spanned from 1/4 mile offshore of Whidbey Island to 3/4 of the way across the sound approximately due west. Appeared to be males and calves in the group.

1450
: Faint
calls
on the Port Townsend hydrophone. Not sure if they've been audible for more than the 5 minutes I've been listening.
1554
: I'm currently uploading a couple recordings to OrcaSound. (Scroll down in the Flash-based player until you get to today's date 080930). There are some listening notes under the Port Townsend tab. Calls getting a bit more intense now. Just heard an S16 (K pod?).

The
orcas
are just hanging out in one area it seems (between Lagoon Pt, Ft. Flagler & Admiralty Head).
Chrissy McLean, Port Townsend Marine Science Center

Jeb Marshall called Orca Network to relay a report of the
orcas
off Ft. Casey State Park at
5 pm.
He said they seemed to be milling in all directions, with no real direction of travel.

- Still hearing great calls,
J, K, L
-- and lots of them at the moment -- at Port Townsend! Recordings on-going and those made earlier this afternoon are at OrcaSound PT
