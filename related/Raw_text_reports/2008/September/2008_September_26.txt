Orca Sightings for September 26, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We arrived on the west side of San Juan Island around
2 pm
, with reports of
Js & a few L's
north of the Center for Whale Research, west San Juan Island, heading south. But the whales were moving very slowly, spread out, many of them offshore. We heard they were off Lime Kiln around

3:30 pm
, by 4 pm they were off Land Bank & nearing Hannah Heights, VERY spread out, mostly off shore - though we got to see a few of them foraging not too far off the rocks. They kept heading south & last we heard was they headed out west.

Today was our third day in a row of observing the
Southern Residents
! Today was a day of watching them slowly progress down Haro Strait. We found
J pod
traveling in small groups and foraging off the lighthouse this afternoon. First J1, Ruffles was spotted way in the distance. Hard to miss that majestic dorsal fin, slowing disappearing and reappearing on the surface of Haro Strait. We were able to watch them and visit different groups of whales, for an hour. J30, Riptide and J14, Samish headed toward shore with lots of short dives and turns and twists changing direction. Hopefully they were finding lots of salmon today! The ability to see these incredible animals, in almost flat calm water, and mild weather was wonderful. Our route home took us the rest of the way around San Juan Island.

We were pretty lucky today to have amazing encounters with
J Pod
, Dall's Porpoise, and a Steller Sea Lion. We began our trip seeing J Pod. They were all foraging between Smuggler's Cove and Lime Kiln. There were a few tightly packed family groups (the J2s were all foraging together inshore) and then other individuals who were a bit more spread out offshore. We had fabulous looks at the J11s (sans J11). J27 (Blackberry) and his younger siblings were all fishing together. It looked like Tsuchi and Mako (J31 and 39 respectively) took up the rear of the group while Blackberry steamed ahead. The animals were bucking the current as they headed down island. We got some great looks at the family groups as well as a few sightings of J1's flailing sea snake - for more information on this, ask your parents.

By

1:30pm
I was mid channel between cattle and iceberg points as a
minke
suddenly crossed my bow about 150 yards distant heading offshore towards the the south. I shut down and heard and saw it again this time at a much greater distance. I changed course to follow at a respectable distance and was rewarded with another blow, again from quite a distance. I shut down again and it showed once more after making two changes of direction, first s.e. than west in the direction of hein bank.
