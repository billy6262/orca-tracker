Orca Sightings for September 1, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
An
Orca
pod was viewed from the BC Ferries vessel on route from Mayne Island to Swartz Bay near the NW corner of Portland Island, just North of the lighthouse. There was only a fishing boat near them and they appeared to be fishing. One whale dove displaying a tail fluke.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research ID'd these whales as the T10 Transient orcas. sb

The
T46B's and T30B
traveled north past the Center for Whale Research at

6:30 a.m
. Ken Balcomb responded to the sighting and encountered the transients off Kellett Bluff at

7:20 a.m
. The whales were traveling tight together and close to shore. The individuals encountered were: T46B, T46B1, T46B1, T46B2 and T30B. The encounter ended at
7:30 a.m. just off Battleship Rock (see photo), with the T's continuing north through Haro Strait.

The
T10's and T100's
were sighted traveling north past the Center for Whale Research at

9:00 a.m
. Dave Ellifrit, John Durban and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research responded and encountered the transients near the south entrance of Mosquito Pass (48 34.68 N; 123 10.51 W) at
9:15 a.m. T10, T10B, T10C, T100, T100B, T100C, and T100D were traveling close to shore along Henry Island. At
10:00 a.m. the whales began to spread out and travel west across Haro Strait toward Halibut Island B.C. The encounter ended at
10:23 p.m. near Halibut Island (48 30.57 N; 123 15.41 W). B.C. with the whales in loose groups traveling quickly toward Sidney Island.

Around

6:30 am
a group of
Transients
made their way northward off W. San Juan Island). Heard it was the T46's and apparently they had a calf with them. Next up on the "parade" route were the T10's around

8:30 am
.

Day seven that at least 1/2 of the
SRKW community
has been together! In Haro Strait, we saw members of
J, K, & L
swimming at a moderate pace north past Stewart Island with the flood tide, from

2:08pm until
3:30pm
. They were split into in 2 large groups, about 15 minutes apart, and loosely spread out into 2's and individuals. As the first orcas closed Stewart Island, they spy hopped, one after another! I counted 12! We ID'd J-1, J-2, J-8, J-28 in the first group, and J-30, J-42 with J-36, L-7, and K-40 in the second group, where we also saw some lunging as they passed!

[
Orcas
] coming up the west side of San Juan pretty much all day (see Transient, Minke & porpoise part of report below). Later in the day,
J's & K's
decided that northward was the way to go so up they went (off west San Juan Island). By the time we were out on the water just north of Battleship, we were watching the few K's that were hanging back and traveling with some of L-Pod. The whales were very spread out, and seemed pretty content to let the flood tide do most of the work as they scooted up north. It was hard to get ID's on some of the whales, but we definitely saw L41 Mega and his distinctive notched dorsal fin. As the whales passed Turn Point, they went from fairly smooth water to very confused seas as the currents collided together. As we left, we also encountered a small (perhaps juvenile)
Minke
whale near Satellite Island (next to Stuart Island). We also saw 5-6
Dall's porpoises
that were traveling in a tight group near a single Dall's calf (but it wasn't swimming with the group which we thought was strange--perhaps it's mother was taken by the transients?)

J, K and L pods
exited Active Pass. Upon leaving the pass at aproximately
1800
many orcas sped through the bubbling tide line with some tail slaps and breaches. There was one spectacular breach just outside of the pass.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported pods of
Transient orcas
heading north past the Center on the west side of San Juan Island at

6:30 am
and again at

8:30 am
. Center for Whale Research staff also sighted a
minke
whale close to shore near Kanaka Bay, west San Juan Island.
