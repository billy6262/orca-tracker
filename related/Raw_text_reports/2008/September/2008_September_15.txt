Orca Sightings for September 15, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research, in continuation with the National Marine Fisheries Service contract, coordinated with a helicopter to conduct aerial photogrammetry surveys. The encounter began at

12:10 p.m
. in Spieden Channel, just northeast of the entrance to mosquito pass (48 37.55 N;123 08.94 W). The whales were spread out in tight groups traveling southwest. The groups seen were the
K14's, K12's, L4's, L47's, J19's
as well as a few other individuals. However, there were many more whales in the area that were not documneted. The encounter ended at

1:30 p.m
. off Kellett Bluff (48 35.17 N;123 12.62 W). The whales continued to travel south down the west side of San Juan Island.

While on route I heard that all
residents
were present on the West Side (SJI). I arrived at
1400
and this was one of those days where there were
orcas
everywhere. They could be seen as far as one could see in every direction. They were taking long dives as they foraged and did some socializing. They moved off shore and some would move back to the shore. At
1740
the trailers were heading towards Hein Bank to meet up with others there and further south.

We had reports of whales along the west side of San Juan Island, and suspected that it was J & K-Pod. So by the time we left, they were already passing the Lime Kiln Lighthouse heading down the island. So off we went towards Cattle Pass. Captain Ivan spotted a lone dorsal fin to the east of us near Iceberg (Lopez Island). It only took me 3 seconds (literally) to hear the dulcet calls of
L-POD
! Soon we were in close enough visual range to start ID-ing whales. L41 and L73. L22. It was a cornucopia of whales, and our passengers got a virtual primer on whale behaviors and vocalizations. Breach after breach, dozens of huge tail lobs, spyhops, and whales just seeming to enjoy the company of other whales. At one point we had L41 come to the surface right next to L22, who had her pectoral fin on his back, as if hugging him close.

Orcas
heading southwest down President's Channel at noon, then through Spieden Channel by
1pm
, at Limekiln Point by 2pm, against a fairly strong mid-flood tide. (They don't go through Spieden Channel very often, so I wonder if they chose that route to utilize the counter current there?). We caught up with them at

2:30pm
in calm, no wind, great visibility conditions, to find the whales spread out from Limekiln far out into Haro Strait and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. It was the west side dosey- doe, as J's and L's were spread out over 5 miles! in singles, two's and a few three's, actively milling and foraging. Very loose groups with youngsters 50' or more from an adult. A few breaches and tail lobs! Numerous directional changes required a diligent watch of where a whale might surface next. A mile off of Hannah Heights, we noticed a group of 2 adult Dall's porpoise with a baby, and a male Orca in their midst!! The Dall's circled, leaped, and zig zagged for a few minutes, with L-57 following every move! (We were at a distance, but my photos show the distinctive right side dorsal tilt of L-57s'). I was holding my breath, hoping the "play" wouldn't be fatal for the calf, as it had been in the past for harbor porpoise. I exhaled when the Dall's and baby broke off heading north, while L-57 continued southeast. At 4pm, off of Eagle Cove, Captain Pete had safely guided us through the last of the whales, an encounter why all of us naturalists love September whales and our summer days in the San Juans!

We tuned in at
1:30 pm to hear calls on OrcaSound, then turned on the OrcaCam and watched as a large pod of
orcas
, including several adult males, passed by the Center for Whale Research,
between
1:45 pm &
2:45 pm
, heading south. Began hearing calls on Lime Kiln Hydrophone around 2 pm, still going at
3 pm
.

I took these photos today at about

7:30am
just west of the Dungeness Spit. He/she (
gray whale
) looks like they are having a good time in our bay.
