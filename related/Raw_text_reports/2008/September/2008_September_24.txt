Orca Sightings for September 24, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We arrived at

2:35pm
to see
J-K-L Pods
on the horizon in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, heading in from the west in 2 large, fairly tight groups, 1/4 a mile apart, swimming at a fast pace with the last of the flood tide! There was a large flock of hundreds of birds reeling and diving over them- as if they anticipated a coming feast of leftovers! As the orcas reached the confluence of Haro Strait, numerous whales began spy hopping, breaching, and pectoral slapping! I have to wonder if the 2 groups were communicating their next moves, as the first group headed up the west side of San Juan Island, while the second group, with L-74, L-87, L-41, and others, spread out in smaller groups all the way to False Bay. They began to forage, mill, and lunge about in the current rips. As a strong southeast wind kicked in, we departed at

3:25pm
, to rock and roll our way east through building seas, watching the orcas behind us leap a little higher with each breath to clear the waves, while the full range of autumn weather showed a rainbow over the island!

After a week without seeing the
Southern Residents
it was very good news that they were headed in past Victoria late this morning! We came across
L pod
as we ran up San Juan Island from Cattle Pass, near False Bay. About

3:00 p.m.
the whales were headed to the shore of San Juan from the west side of Haro Strait. It seemed everywhere I looked, there were large male fins cutting through the water. (
L-78, L-57
) They appeared to be intent on foraging and traveling today. The whales were very spread out, and although I heard all three pods were present, I ID'd only L pod whales. Many whales were traveling or foraging in groups of two or three,(L-79 and L-87) and a lot of the males were grouped together. We traveled northward with the whales, reaching Andrews Bay by

4:20 p.m
. As far as I could see to the north, more blows and fins.

We left for the Victoria area, where the
Resident Killer Whales
were inbound towards our waters and fast, all 3 pods returning at once. We had some great looks at K21 & K40, then later of L72 Racer, brother Nigel, and calf L105. When we caught up to the rest of the
Js and Ks
3 miles off Hannah Heights they were playfully swimming through the current rip along with all the birds! J1 & friends got a little playful, there were breaches, belly rolls and tail slaps. I still can't get over all the birds! Seemed like there was a lot of bait fish in the water, which is good news. The wind started to pick up out of the East as we headed back for Cattle Pass.

S2 and S16
calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone at
1525
. No calls on Orcasound hydrophone and whale watch vessels on Highland web cam, so whales likely northbound.

This is my first time reporting anything, but I was listening to the Lime Kiln Hydrophone and since

15:10
apx. There was a couple of orca calls. It was repeating the same phrase with a change here or there. I do not know if any orcas were sighted around this time, they were in the area for definately 30 minutes.

We tuned into OrcaSound at about

4:10 pm
and listened to some GREAT orca chatter for awhile at Lime Kiln, then switched to OrcaSound hydrophone to listen some more - probably listened for about an hour as the whales traveled north. At about
4:15 we watched on the OrcaCam and spotted a few whales swimming past the Center for Whale Research too.
