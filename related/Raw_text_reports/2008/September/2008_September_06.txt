Orca Sightings for September 6, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Erin Heydenreich and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research found
T30B, T46B1, T46B, T46B2
traveling in a loose group off Port Angeles (48 17.111 N; 123 20.039 W) at

2:02 p.m
. A few hundred yards away, the rest of the T30's (T30A, T30C, and T30) were encountered at
2:27 p.m. At
2:45 p.m. the group of T30's, now joined by T30B, made a kill on a harbor porpoise. After the whales moved on from the kill and rejoined the T46B's, Center staff observed a pair of lungs still attached to the rib cage floating on the surface of the water. Straitwatch soon came over to collect the harbor porpoise remains for analysis. The encounter ended at

3:15 p.m.
a few miles northwest of Dungeness Bay (48 15.66 N; 123 17.02 W).

We arrived on scene (Strait of Juan de Fuca, north of Port Townsend) with the
T-46's
soon after they had made the porpoise kill. Mixed with the described play and social activity were hunting behaviors. I had my binoculars directly tuned to a murre who was nervously scuttling away from the milling whales, and I could see the bulge of water being pushed by a pursuing transient. Just as the murre started to achieve some air (about 3 feet), the orca came up from behind, breached and captured the bird in its mouth, disappearing with it into the water.

We got to the
orcas
after 26 nautical miles ONE WAY nearly to Port Angeles, WA. We encountered the
T46s and T30A
just outside Port Angeles and boy was it an adventure! When we arrived on scene we witnessed a kill. We believe the animal they pursued and ate together was a porpoise. Chatter on the radio was that there was a rib cage and lungs floating in the area and the research vessel on site was scooping them up for analysis. After the porpoise kill, the Ts took their time playing, spy hopping, and rolling around each other. They definently seemed content with their meal. And a relatively new orca calf in T46B2.
