There were
Orca
moving south in Sansum Narrows between

9:30 -
10:30 am
. A fellow named Jim Ingram, in a tiny sloop called the "Scout" was hanging out near Burial Island, and he thought there were 6 whales: 3 with big fins and one baby. The 15+ seals on the island were nervous, he reported! I saw 2 orca diving near Burial Island and went out to look but never saw them again. Would anyone know who these whales might be?

My guess is these were Transients, given the pod size, behavior, & the scared seals! sb
