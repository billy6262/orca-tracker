Orca Sightings for September 21, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just wanted to let folk know that after discussions with the Cascadia/NOAA team and studying the id shots they took of the small
Minke
whale in San Juan Channel Jon and I confirmed that this was one of the new whales that we encountered in early August. This was a whale that we named Ellie, in memory of Ellie Dorsey who pioneered the study of minke whales around the San Juan Islands in the early 1980s.

Right out the gate in San Juan Channel, we sighted the small
Minke
whale, north of Shaw Island, three Brown Pelicans flying by north end of San Juan Island, and Harbor Porpoise.

We had a
minke
and
orcas
As we left Friday Harbor, we had heard earlier reports that a minke whale was in San Juan Channel heading down towards Friday Harbor, so we had all eyes scanning the water as we headed north. And "eagle eyes" Captain Ivan saw the minke near Yellow Island. It was a small juvenile with a very interesting "divot" in the lower spine near the tail flukes. It would surface 4-6 times and then dive for 4-7 minutes. We observed the minke for 15 minutes and then headed north to see the orcas.

On the Western Prince we encountered the
T2s (T2, T2C, T2C1, and T2C2)
near Moresby Island around
4 PM.
At one point, a Steller sea lion came to the surface with a fish and was being bombarded by sea gulls. One of the whales, which hadn't surfaced in a while, did a huge full-body lunge right where the Steller sea lion had been surfacing, scattering all the gulls. We thought a chase might be on, but we didn't see the steller again and the whales just slowly continued on their way.

A group of 4
Transients
by Moresby Island at about

2:40pm
, all amid very little tidal exchange, glass like conditions. The T's (too far way for ID's) took long, slow, graceful dives, unpredictable course, covering large distances between surfacings, yet in the same general area when we left at

3:30pm
.

When we arrived north of Gooch Island (over on the BC side of Haro Strait), we observed 4 whales traveling slowly westward. Turns out it was the
T2s
(with the very distinctive notch on the lower trailing edge of I believe it is T2a?). They were surfacing very slowly, and as they rounded the top of Moresby, one of the T's then launched out of the water and landed smack on the gulls, scattering them to the sky and frightening the sea lion. No critters were apparently munched on as we saw the sea lion swim away, and a few minutes later the T's continued their way west. I've read a few reports this summer of T's going after birds, but this was the first time I had ever witnessed this behavior.

I am listening to OrcaSound, and about half an hour ago I started hearing something weird. It started with ship noise, but there was more. I recorded it, however it is really short. I also sent the file to Scott, still waiting for responce (yes I know it is early in the morning). My guess is Transients, but I might be wrong. I started recording at
15:23, wich is
06:23 over there.
