Orca Sightings for September 5, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
While on a whale watch out of Anacortes we did observe
T-14, "Pender"
, cruising for about thirty minutes, (about
two pm
PST) near Discovery Island, with eight to nine surfaces before regularly taking deeper dives for about five to six minutes. I captured one photo of this majestic fellow and thought I would share, just in case there were any particular Pender fans out there who wanted to catch a recent glimpse of that towering dorsal fin.

Radio rumors had the residents off the coast by La Push, although heading into the Strait of Juan de Fuca by late afternoon, (
last I have is the whales off La Push were Humpbacks. Ron Bates, MMRG, Victoria, B.C.
) and a group of transients by Race Rocks. We headed to Discovery Island, Canada, in calm slack low tide conditions, where we watched
T-14 - Pender
, hunt back and forth by bull kelp beds, from
3pm to
3:30pm
, although we had seen a few harbor seals in the water on our way there, none were visible in the kelp beds or surrounding rocks. He slowly passed the edge of the kelp, then sped up at times, slapped his curled tail flukes on the surface 3 different times, arched his back, and made a few lunges as he headed toward Victoria. His is a poignant story to share, considering he and his mother T-13, were some of the last whales to be captured and released in 1976, (without the injunction stopping the captures, there could be a very different ending, certainly not the sightings we've had of him this year-) as well as the scars he carries from the radio pack pinned to his dorsal fin. Now he is an orphan, solitary, one tough whale!
