Orca Sightings for September 11, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit, Astrid van Ginneken, Mackenzie Consoer and Stefan Jacobs of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J, K, and L pods
two miles southwest of Trail Island B.C. (48 21.563 N;123 19.609 W) at

3:03 p.m
. The three pods were extremely spread out and traveling northeast. Although there were several reports of J's in the area, the Center only encountered J27. However, several K pod and L pod individuals were documeneted and it is believed that all the southern residents were in the area. The whales were mostly traveling at a steady pace northeast, but some foraging and milling behavior was observed. The Center vessel Orca was again coordinating with a helicopter to conduct aerial photography surveys. The encounter ended at

6:35 p.m.
just off Kellett Bluff (48 35.189 N; 123 12.577 W). J's, K's and L's were still spread out along the west side of San Juan Island from Lime Kiln past Turn Point.

We took off from Friday Harbor to make it to
all three resident pods
who were swimming towards us on a flood tide from west of Race Rocks. We believe we saw
J14 and J30
when we came on scene. We also saw K11 plowing through the water on her way into the Haro Strait with the rest of the resident pods. We were surprised when L85 (Mystery) and his cousin L22 (Spirit) showed up right near our boat! It appeared that some salmon were hiding near our boat and these two took advantage of that. We also had another close pass from L57 (Faith) as he traveled relatively alone in the group. The animals were very spread out and difficult to keep track of, but we had some really awesome looks at L Pod animals on their way back into our area. On our way back to Friday Harbor, we stopped for a
Harbour Porpoise calf
who seemed to be disoriented as it leaped repeatedly out of the water.
