Orca Sightings for September 17, 2008
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had an interesting encounter today with the
T18s
, not only because of their behavior, but because we could catch a glimpse of a research vessel in action as well. We saw the T18s in Rosario just outside of Thatcher Pass. The research vessel Phocoena was on scene. The animals moved from Thatcher Pass up Rosario and then back through Peavine Pass and we left them in Upright Channel. It was difficult to predict their movements today because they were making long dives and swimming in no particular direction. They would dive going one way and surface somewhere completely different! Typical Transients!

At about
10AM
I saw 2 or 3
orcas
from my kayak. One of them was a male. They were very close to shore immediately west of Freshwater Bay outside of Port Angeles. They were heading west. 45 minutes later when we arrived at a place we call seal cove there were 30 harbor seals hauled out on the rocks. That is the most seals I've every seen out of the water there. I imagine that they all cleared out of the water when the whales came in the vicinity.

There was a good looking
Grey Whale
at the Bluffs, Dungeness Spit today. It was busy foraging and giving us some big blows and tail flukes. Seen by Mark's Zodiac Prince of Whales.
