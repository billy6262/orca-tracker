I was trying very hard not to pout. But the last two days have been amazing. Yesterday the T60s made a very close pass just off the rocks at Point Caution. And today, T75B3 and T75B4 (thanks Monika and Sara for help with the IDs) were kelping just feet from shore at South Beach! I have never seen whales that close at South Beach. I didn't even know it was possible for whales to come that close at South Beach. -photos by Cindy Hansen, August 14, 2024*T75B2 Jasper & T75B Pebbles - T49A6 Charlie II - [I] had a fabulous day with two beautiful encounters on the west side of San Juan Island.

August 12BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Mon, Aug 12 - San Juans (T75Bs) - 75Bs. -John Boyd [WSSJI]*Mon, Aug 12 - San Juans (T65As minus T65A5) - Sorry to be so tardy in reporting this. However, this is new for me, and I have been searching, trying to find out if something else had been reported about these whales we saw while on the ferry coming from Lopez to Anacortes on Monday evening. We have been traveling on that ferry route for more than 30 years, and in that time, this is the first time I have ever seen whales on that crossing! And actually it was a passenger in the car with me who spotted them. She was visiting me from Turkey and I was taking her back so she could catch her flight back to Istanbul. One of the things she had wanted to do, and we didn't have time for, was a whale watching trip. We were on the very late 6:20 pm departure of the Yakima from Lopez and we were in Thatcher Pass between Blakely and Decatur Islands. We were in the car on the upper deck facing Blakely when suddenly she announced "Whales!" and was out of the car like a shot! She had her phone with her and had her camera running and filmed about 50 seconds of video of them. She was over the moon excited!!!! And so was I!!! The ferry captain made no announcement about the whales. We were traveling east toward Anacortes. The whales were heading west. We thought at first there was only one whale. However when we later looked at the video, there are two. I am estimating that the video was shot at about 7:55 pm on Monday. Anyway, my Turkish friend ended up with a whale sighting from a Washington State ferry and was extremely happy. -Mary Ann Cameron*Mon, Aug 12 - San Juans (T60s) - 14:23 - The T60s are still heading into Bellingham Channel, close to south end of Cypress Island now. -Cynthia Nielsen*Mon, Aug 12 - Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca (T37/T37Bs & T77s) - T77D Alcyon, T77 Asja, T37B Harald, T37B3, T77C Neftali - T37B Harald & T37B316:00 - 17:00 - We saw the T37s and T77s just north of Admiralty Inlet. -photos & IDs by Kyla Bivens, August 12, 2024*Mon, Aug 12 - Strait of Juan de Fuca (T34s, T37/37Bs, T77s) - T37B1 Lance - T37B Harald & T37B3 -IDs by Rachel Haight, Orca Network*Flat calm waters today allowed us to go the distance to see the T034s and T037s, accompanied by T077C.
