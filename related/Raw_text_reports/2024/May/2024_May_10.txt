Several individuals from shore were trying to slow the boater down.Photos available?: Yes, I will email the photos to sightings@orcanetwork.org*Sent via form submission from Orca NetworkName: Marcia RDate of Sighting: May 10, 2024Time: 11:55 AMSpecies seen: OrcaNumber of animals seen: 4Where seen: Oakland Bay near SheltonDirection of travel : Eastward out of Bay via Hammersley InletBehaviors observed: Traveling. Had been hunting out of our view near the marina.If orcas, any males?: Unknown as high bank view.Any unusual markings?:Is there anything else you'd like to share about your encounter?: They were being followed too closely by a small teal green boat.
