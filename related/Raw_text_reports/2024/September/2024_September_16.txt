Entry 4:
Excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter #96: “We got on scene at 0930 about a mile off Hannah Heights. L90 and L128 were tight together, as one would expect, and pointed slowly up Haro Strait. Despite early hopes of other whales being around, L90 and L128 were the only two SRs seen in the strait. The pair were near the border but not so close that we couldn’t get the drone up over them. We attempted one photo-ID pass but L90 turned away from us before we could even get within 200 hundred yards. It was clear she was not ready for anyone to be close yet, so we stopped trying and took proof of presence photos from a distance while we flew over them…” Read more here at Center for Whale Research Encounter #96.*Mon, Sep 16 - Haro Strait (L90 & L128)14:00 - Passed Smuggler’s Cove headed northeast. -Anna Gelb [WSSJI]*13:35 - Seeing from County Park northbound. -Kendra Nelson [WSSJI]*13:16 - Northbound from Lime Kiln.13:09 - Northbound from Land Bank.12:52 - In dark current west close to Land Bank pushing her north but facing south.12:40 - From Land Bank far south east of mid southbound. -Thé Hsin [WSSJI]*09:20 - Visual line of sight between Land Bank and Discovery, far offshore. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute [WSSJI]*07:35 - Listening to SRKW calls this morning on the Lime Kiln webcam. -Marla Smith, Orca Network*BIGG'S KILLER WHALES (mammal-eating ecotype) - Mon, Sep 16 - Strait of Juan de Fuca (T63 & T65)13:30 - T63 ‘Chainsaw’ and his mom T65 ‘Whidbey II’ are westbound at my map spot [48.219204, -123.065093 (2mi.
