Entry 1:
*

3:50 p.m. -
just saw them heading north, mid-channel slightly
south of Bells Beach
. -Emily Wandres
*
Southbound spy-hopping
member of K pod heading towards Langley, Whidbey Island, as seen from Hidden Beach
, followed by an apparent consensus by the 7-8 orcas to turn around and head north again from Langley mid-afternoon. Their welcome arrival was an uplifting sight for visitors and regular whale-watchers alike, drawing 2016 and the losses to the Southern Resident community to a close with a message of hope. -Sandra Pollard.
