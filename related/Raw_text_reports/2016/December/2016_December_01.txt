Orca Sightings for December 1, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
How fun to be on the ferry with a bunch of folks heading to the big event tomorrow and have the ferry captain get on the PA and tell us we had some whales in front of the ferry. Saw between
8-9 Unidentified orcas just off the Anacortes ferry terminal
in mid-Rosario, southbound. 2 big males. 3 breaches, but we never got close enough to be able to get any IDs. -John Boyd (JB)
*
10-12 orca southbound off Reef Pt. in Rosario Strait
. -Marie Waterman, WS Ferries

On our way to Sydney, today, we saw a group of
about 10 Dall's porpoise cavorting in a bay off San Juan island opposite Spieden Island
