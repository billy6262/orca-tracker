Orca Sightings for December 21, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the morning of 12/21/16, Dave Ellifrit was notified by Jane Cogan that there were J pod calls audible on the hydrophones. Dave called Melisa Pinnow and they both left Snug Harbor at
10:46 aboard Orcinus. At
11:03, Dave and Melisa arrived on scene with J36, J39, and J52 off of Bellevue Point traveling in a loose group south down Haro Strait. The three whales paused to forage for a few minutes and J39 breached once before splitting off from J36 and J52 and moving offshore. J26 was a little further south and inshore of the other three, also traveling south...See photos and full summary report at CWR Encounter 124. -Center for Whale Research
