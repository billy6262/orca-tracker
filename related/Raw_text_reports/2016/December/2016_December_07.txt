Orca Sightings for December 7, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
... arrived on scene, offshore of the
San Juan County Park at
14:50
. While the leaders were long gone, the trailers were spread out, slow traveling west-southwest. While Giles drove, Jim first photographed
J34
, followed by photos of
J47 and J44
engaged in social behavior including rolling over on each other. The next whale photographed was
J45
, youngest calf of deceased J14, who was observed swimming nearest to J34. J22 was first photographed alone heading south but within a few minutes she was joined by her son
J34
and both whale changed direction, as did the other three young males, and headed west southwest toward Discovery Island.... See photos and full summary report at CWR Encounter 123. -Center for Whale Research

3:45 p.m. - Saw for sure J16s, 14s, 17s, and 19s
but quite a few more way off- one nice pass!

2:42 p.m. - We're at Lime Kiln and see them, Js.
Leaders past Lime Kiln very spread. Some porpoising, moving quick with the ebb. -Monika Wieland Shields

Unidentified whales - Saw
one blow from Whidbey Island near Lagoon Point
, but haven't seen anything since. That was about 30-45 minutes ago (

3:10ish
). -Margaret Marshall

1:00 pm - Just saw a brief glimpse of a tail on the Edmonds-Kingston ferry
. Closer to Kingston side, my guess is a humpback. -Madelyn Gilbert Aman
