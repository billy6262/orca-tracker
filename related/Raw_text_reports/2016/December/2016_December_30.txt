Orca Sightings for December 30, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Center for Whale Research Encounter 127 with the
T86As and T124As in Haro Strait
: "The photos were good enough to determine that there were actually
two new calves and that both T124A and T124A2 appear to be the mothers
. If this turns out to be the case, we will refer to
the new calves as T124A6 and T124A2B respectively
, per Jared Towers and DFO."
*

4:15 p.m. - Saratoga Passage, I was at Camano State Park.
They were heading steady North after meandering a bit. There was 3 in front of the beach and I think 2 more were further north and further from the beach. -Jerry Purnell (
ID confirmation by Sara Hysong-Shimazu
)

My birthday twin bro Howard Garrett met up with me at B
aby Island area, we patiently waited, and FINALLY saw a blow
could see they were heading southeast. We both headed off to
Fox Spit
and this is where we saw the best of them,
with K26
cruising southbound with his family nearby in
Saratoga Passage
, totally awesome! Orcas continued southeast towards
Langley
and met up with others there to watch them
until around
3:30
. It looked like they were heading back north again? that would be kewl. It surely was a great day! Love belated birthday presents blessed, so blessed! -Marilyn Armbruster

End of year greetings to you guys, what a way to end it with
Kpod
out there today....Not sure how many whales I saw, but could ID (after briefly looking at photos) the following: Members of the .
K12s, K13s and K14s, K13, 25, 26, 21, 44, 22 (I think), 27, 34 and 43
. They were having 3-4 minute down times, and then ALL surfacing at the same time, heart-stopping - so beautiful to see!! A bit choppy out there, not getting good saddle patches. Hopefully others did as it sounds like the water was much calmer near Langley. -Jill (and Clarence)
(
ID notes by Sara Hysong-Shimazu: the lighting doesn't make it easy on any of these but. looks like the two whales on the left is K22 and K33. Maybe K38 in the background.
)

About

4:30 p.m. - from the same location (Saratoga Rd) looking out onto the Saratoga Passage

*

4:21 p.m. - Right off Camano State Park
right now! They were spread out in the channel, but two came by about 50 feet off shore. -Joanne Ring Reman,

2:51 p.m. -
they appear to have approached
Langley
, stalled, and turned N again. Leaving them now. Amazing to see them on this sunny, calm day on Saratoga. -Steve Smith

It was a wind chill kind of day, but after searching for 45 minutes from near Baby Island on Whidbey with a 180 degree view from Mabana Beach to Greenbank, K pod orcas finally began to show up. They were scattered far and wide, mostly one at a time, diving 5-10 minutes and very hard to predict where they would surface. Most were way over on the Camano side but
K26, K42, and K20
came close to our side. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

1:15 p.m. - Orcas in Saratoga
. I viewed
a mother and 2 babies in the Saratoga Passage
moving towards Langley. I can't tell any markings but were in the middle of the passage. Mother breached as she passed our house on
Baby Island
. -Adam Wendt
*

12:20 p.m. - Passing Hidden Beach southbound
. -Sandra Pollard
*

12:12 p.m. -
I'm just
east of Baby Island high bluff and have finally spotted them due north
and I would say east of Shangri La shores 1/4 mid channel Whidbey Island side kind of veering southeast. -Marilyn Armbruster

11:10 a.m. - Group of six close together passed Shangri La
heading steadily south. -Sandra Pollard

between Race and Harrington (Lagoons)

10:32 a.m. -
Right off
Harrington Lagoon now! At least 6
, mid channel, heading south. (Pod flipped )

9:40 a.m. - Standing at Harrington Lagoon, I can see them over on the Oak Harbor side, moving north
. They are right under Mt. Erie from where I am standing, for a site line. -Mary Fell Cheston
*

9:12 a.m. - They've passed my house (2 miles south of Penn Cove) northbound, 4-5 of them
so far. Mid-channel, but "could" be angling towards Penn Cove. Heading out in a few minutes... -Jill Hein

almost to Race Lagoon

10:26 a.m. - Checked out Holmes Harbor - lots of harbor porpoise
. -Sandra Pollard
*

8:57 a.m. -
There are at least
5 Harbor porpoise deep into Holmes Harbor
. They seem to mill around together for a few minutes and then disappear and surface in a different spot. They were definitely not orcas. Very small fins. -Cindi Bowen
