Orca Sightings for December 16, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:45 p.m.
- Rosario Strait - Just wanted to report
two whales seen in Rosario Strait
, just outside of Burrows Island and Washington Park, headed north. One male for sure and one female, I only saw them surface a few times in the choppy water. -Krissy Burkhart
*

6:07 p.m. - Saratoga Passage -
(
No IDs, but we presume these to be residents
) - I can hear the orcas! Very close to the shore, just
off of Pebble Beach (south Camano Island)
. Direction of travel...unknown. -Sarah Malmsteaad
*

3:00 p.m. - 2-3 near Bells beach
lots of splashing headed south. -Jaime Scaggs
*

2:59 p.m. -
Behavior change.
Seems like they've woken up
. Breaches, cartwheels, porpoising.

2:54 p.m. - whales approaching Bells Beach
southbound mid channel.

2:43 p.m. - passing Fox Spit midchannel/Camano side
. Still slowly southbound. Too far for IDS. -Rachel Haight
*
2.00 p.m. - Whales heading steadily south as seen from Hidden Beach
. Appear closer to Camano side....Day Four of Southern Residents in Puget Sound (at least we believe these were Southern Residents in Saratoga Passage today) (unconfirmed- ALB) ...too far for IDs and lighting conditions were tricky with distortion on the water. Mt. Baker looks stunning with all that fresh snow. -Sandra Pollard
*
It would take a little magic to ID the
whales we saw this afternoon headed south in Saratoga Pass
. This image was taken from
Hidden Beach
as the whales passed the headland that is Camano Island State Park. I can only assume they were the SRKW's that were nearby yesterday. I can say for sure they were Orca. -Richard Snowberger
