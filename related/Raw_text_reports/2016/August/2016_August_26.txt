Orca Sightings for August 26, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J28 Polaris - Haro Strait -
Got to watch
J28, J46, and J54
from shore for hours. We did see J46 actively lunging and chasing salmon, so I am hopeful she shared some with her mother. I have to remain hopeful that whatever is going on with J28, she can overcome it. For her sake and the sake of the Southern Resident Killer Whale community, I have to keep up the hope. -Traci Walter

It was pretty bonkers today up north! Big beautiful resting group all the way along the bank travelling about 1.5 knots. They hit the
coal port
- Georgia Strait - and then I've never seen anything like it......It looked like
the majority of Group A just started launching
!! Caught a few,
J19 Shachi breach, J37 Hy'Shqa launches
too, but missed a lot of them....no idea where to point the camera. -Gary Sutton
*
Later this afternoon we saw another
J-Pod group (with J2, L87, and J16s among them) way up north (south of Point Roberts)
. L87 Onyx was traveling with J2 Granny and another J pod whale in Georgia Strait.Lots of social behaviors, spyhops, tail and pec slaps, rolling around, cuddle puddles, you name it, they did it). -Astrid Heinisch
*
I've been thinking about
J28 "Polaris"
and her family ever since I heard the news that she wasn't doing well. When I heard whales were sighted I had to go and watch from shore. It was nice and cool by the water compared to inland near town. As bittersweet as it was, I am glad I went and spent the time at
Lime Kiln
. Got to watch
J28, J46, and J54
from shore for hours. We did see J46 actively lunging and chasing salmon, so I am hopeful she shared some with her mother.

When I left at

3:30 the J17s were still off Land Bank
, but may have been actually moving south after hanging there for the last 4 hours. J22s looked to be off False Bay based on boat locations.

2:05 p.m. - J17s & J22s
very spread and foraging from
Lime Kiln to False Bay
, facing south but not really moving. Shore-based encounter with the J17 matriline off Sand Juan County Land Bank's Westside Preserve. Everyone was there - including J28 Polaris - but she's still looking really underweight. Notice the depressions around her blowhole and eyepatches. She's clearly a fighter! Hoping by some miracle she finds a way to pull through. -Monika Wieland
*
With soaring temperatures, out on the water was the best place to be... Just beyond
San Juan Channel we spotted a Minke whale
surfacing, before continuing along the
west side of San Juan where the J22's, Oreo (J22), mother of Doublestuf (J34) and Cookie (J38)
were moving in a southerly direction with evidence of feeding patterns (milling) along the way. It's always a delight to see these closely bonded whales in their family groups. Our return journey took us past Whale Rocks, where a number of magnificent Steller sea-lions were holding court among the cormorants and oyster-catchers we were fortunate to get a glimpse of today. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

12:25 p.m. - orcas just east of yellow buoy south of Useless Bay
, beaching etc... very active. Seem to be trending north more into Useless Bay. As seen from north Edmonds shoreline. -Stu Davidson

Pod of about ten Orcas came into Puget Sound
today. The video starts where the group was just south of Useless Bay (South Whidbey) hunting. After a successful hunt the Orcas started heading southerly passing Edmonds and continuing further into central south. Long distance videoing from North Edmonds waterfront. -Stu Davidson

11:05 a.m. - 10 to 12 orcas mid channel
southbound
between Point No Point and Indian head
(Whidbey Island, south end). -Christopher Lewman

At

8:15 a.m. on the west shore of Whidbey Island
we counted at least six orcas (with two young?) tight into the
Lagoon Point
beach and headed south - fantastic! -Dianne Dianne Br√§tz

At least
4 orca seen going south at Lagoon Point about

Juan de Fuca...off Botanical Beach in Port Renfrew the day before...found 10+ humpback whales
... -Paul Pudwell
*

8:00 p.m. - 3-4 Dall's Porpoises feeding off of Whidbey Island Fox Spit
in Saratoga Passage throughout the evening. They were black and white and looked like a smaller version of Orcas. They could possibly have been Orcas, and I might have been confused by the distance between us. We've had them pass through here before.N 48 degrees 5'30.1632 W 122 degrees 29'34.044 Fox Spit Whidbey Island. -Jim Lovvorn
