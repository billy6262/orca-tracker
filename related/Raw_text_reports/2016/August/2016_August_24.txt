Orca Sightings for August 24, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J28 Polaris and her 7-month-old son J54, Juan de Fuca - Southern Residents Killer Whales
were feeding well off Jordan River in the "Traffic Lanes" with 20+ Humpbacks in the area. -Paul Pudwell
*
In the night the whales continued going out the Strait of Juan de Fuca and by the afternoon of the 24th August they were off
Clallam Bay
, Olympic Peninsula on the US side of the border, still heading toward the Pacific Ocean. We were
concerned about J28's physical condition
as she appeared emaciated three days ago when seen by Melissa Pinnow from shore, and since we did not see her yesterday we asked Mark Malleson to report if he saw her. Off Clallam Bay
he did see her still alive in the group
, but we still have concerns that she has apparently lost weight.
