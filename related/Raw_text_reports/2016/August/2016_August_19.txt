A breaching
humpback
! On yet another glorious summer's day, Mystic Sea cut through clear, calm seas towards Port Angeles where we encountered
juvenile humpback 'Split Fin' (BCZ0298)
, calf of 'Big Mama' (BCY0324), another of our well-known visiting humpbacks. No-one knows how 'Split Fin' sustained the original injury, but it was good to see this playful and curious young whale exhibiting an explosive breach followed by some exuberant tail-slapping with those mighty flukes. Humpbacks, the most acrobatic of the great whales, have made a welcome return to our local waters, impressing whale watchers with their sheer size and power and providing everlasting memories. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

a spout mid-channel just south of Narrows Bridge at

I'm not sure if any of you are interested in these two sightings of
common dolphins near Bellingham
, but here they are just in case. Attached is a photo from the first sighting. Below is the information for each one. WDFW personnel (Fenner Yarborough, Paul DeBruyn) spotted 8-10 common dolphins on 8/19 at 48.728988 -122.594725 while doing surf scoter surveys. Species was confirmed by Whale Museum. We have more pictures if need. There was 1 possible juvenile in the group, we noticed this by its continual jumping out of the water. WDFW personnel spotted 10-12 common dolphins on 8/21 just south of Vendovi Island. No GPS point was taken. -Gary J. Wiles, WDFW
