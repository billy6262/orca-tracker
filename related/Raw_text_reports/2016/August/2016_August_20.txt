Orca Sightings for August 20, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of all three pods (J, K, & L)
mostly traveling & foraging (with some sweet surface activity & calf activity at the end) while making their way through Haro Strait. Filmed from shore at Land Bank, west side San Juan Island. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

A hot summer's day into a warm summers night on
Haro Strait. Whales from
6:40 in the morning until
9:40 in the evening!
Early morning
Minke
followed by a steady daylong presence of combinations of
Js, Ks, and Ls streaming by in Haro Strait
foraging very spread out, up and down San Juan Island all day. Such a gift to watch little
J52
(among all the among all the others) engaged in some excellent breaches, tail lobs, spyhops, and more. Their presence traveling up and down island continued into the dark of night where we sat, under a blanket of stars (& planets), listening to above water exhalations while listening to live underwater vocals of the same Southern Resident orcas as they drift southbound....dreamy. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

First whales seen at8 this morning, last whales seen at 8 tonight
. I'm exhausted (and not complaining one bit!) Members of all three pods present -
perhaps even all the Southern Residents
- but basically spread from the Fraser River to the Strait of Juan de Fuca when all was said and done!

K13s were the first.
K25 Scoter
spent a lot of time foraging back and forth out from Land Bank. Another group arrived grouped up, maybe that was
L47s
? Then a few more. Looking south I did not see anymore coming so came up to house. Happily surprised short time later when more showed up, at lease 4 probably more like 6. Two open saddle individuals (L72 and L105), then looked like L92 Crewser at rear with an adolescent (
L110
). I look forward to expert ID's, but I'd say approx 20+ whales? (Thanks to Monika Wieland for ID help/confirmation)
