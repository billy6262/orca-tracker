Orca Sightings for August 2, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:45 am -
reports and sent short video of
Fin in Case Inlet, way north near Victor
, circling then last seen heading south. -Beverly McCallum
*
We left port with no whale reports so headed around the
south side of Lopez Island via Colville Island
to see the seals hauled out and - aha -
minke whale reports at Hein Bank, and humpbacks
a little further to the west! So off we headed in that direction. The trip was a little bumpy at times but Capt Eric kept us on a steady course - we found
a humpback a few miles west of Hein Bank
and had quality time viewing this gentle giant as (s)he fed in the area. There were a few good fluke (tail) shots, and a few "almost" fluke shots. Homeward bound we encountered two (or three) minke whales, still
near Hein Bank
. No orca today, but two of our favorite baleen whales were well worth watching! A long but enjoyable day aboard Mystic Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
