Down to

around sunset. Approx
6 orcas spread out in 2's off Salmon Bank
and just to the west. Calf breach but otherwise very lazy and long dives. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

...I definitely saw
J28
. We didn't' know it was her until we looked at photos. She was logging and
J54
was rubbing on her. -Cindy Hansen

4:22 p.m. - Group of 7+
one ahead of them, then tight northbound group close in shore who would have goneright on rocks at
Lime Kiln
, but some boat right off shore off the lighthouse, so they turned out as they went past the park. 2 flipped, showed up off Land Bank heading south now. Others are coming from south. All spread
About
3:00 p.m. - 2 group meet-up middle Land Bank
coming from north and south. Just before contact SB group porpoised towards NB group, both groups went down for 4-5 minute dive. Surfaced in two groups again in same general area, now all southbound, lead in a line side by side...beautiful.

2:35 p.m. -
So many babes! Many have flipped and are now southbound. Currently spread off
south Land Bank and Hannah Heights
. Shortly after

1:00 pm
went out to the rocks to see leaders coming from the south. In the hour or so following watched lots o milling & foraging. Middle Offshore Land Bank. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

2:00 p.m. -
foraging as they still slowly go north. I only positively identified
Js
but didn't see all of them, some were maybe still south and there may have been more than Js present, tough lighting.

1:40 p.m. - I know J2, J19s, J14s, J16s
were in lead group that went north, but wasn't sure who all was in that next big group with all the babies from the initial pass.
J28
was in that big foraging group of moms and juveniles
off Land Bank at
1:40
. Lots of lunging, rolling, surface activity, and vocalizing at that time from the whole tight group.

12:50 p.m. - leaders at Edwards Pt, west side San Juan Island
. -Monika Wieland
*

8:50 p.m. -
heard them before I saw them, a
group of 4 Orca (including 1 adult male) coming up from Discovery Bay
, north along the shores of Cape George. They were blowing loudly and slapping their tails on the water...playing as they traveled lazily along the shore. What a sight to behold! ... I lost sight of them in the darkness as they head north to the straits. Feeding, playing, traveling, avoiding whale watching boats, breaching, slapping tails on the surface, flapping fins on the surface. -Terri Brown
*

8:20 p.m. - A small pod of orcas (4-7) swam into Discovery Bay twice
on Thursday

Entry 2:
once in the morning, and then again in the early evening
. On the second visit they were followed by some whale watching boats and then disappeared - but after the boats left, on their way back out, they gave an amazing show breaching multiple times out of the water! -Lisa Chick
*
I am 7, and we saw
about 6 orcas (including adult male) in Discovery Bay about
7:30 tonight
. That was cool and amazing. Feeding and traveling. -Braedon Bibb
*

6:06 p.m. -
They headed south
past Smith island
to the channel marker thing then they went west. Three boats were with them. -Melinda Killian

3:24 p.m. - Orcas heading south along Whidbey. Seen from West Beach RD
. -Hazel Foster

3:08 p.m. - Orcas just passed Rocky Point Beach at Whidbey
heading south.
Maybe 4
. Just by Smith Island. -Mary Janowiecki
*

2:00 p.m. -
live on the west side of Whidbey Island, a little
north of Ft. Bey State Park
. This afternoon I saw
three Orca
whales, one large and two smaller (one adult male I think), about two miles offshore, heading south. There were three whale watching boats in the vicinity in no time! I watched them for about 45 minutes. It's my first sighting since moving to the island in May!! -Shirlie White
*

2:00 p.m. -
Anna Stevens reported a Big pod near
Deception Pass
.
*
Today, we were greeted by
12 to 15 transient orcas right there near Blakely island
! We stayed with this bunch as they headed towards Bird Rocks. Upon arrival at Bird Rocks we were also able to see harbor seals and steller sea lions as we continued watching the black and whites. ...we ventured back towards the transients who were now at Lawson's Reef. During this 30-45 minute stint with them we watched closely as they ate, porpoised, slapped their tails and even did a couple of breaches!...-Amy W., Mystic Sea

This
morning
from Cpt. Dan with The
T60's off Sooke
, BC. -Paul Pudwell
*
Very early aug 25 (about
2 am
) I was awakened by
a solo whale (presumably orca) heading west towards Monarch Head
(property is
near E Point, Saturna
). About 20 min later this same orca (?) came by again now heading east in opposite direction. Behavior is rare since it seemed it was a single whale and reversing direction in the middle of the night. -James McLarnon
*
Just west of
Chito Beach Resort
, near Shipwreck point - Juan de Fuca.
Gray whales
hung around for 4 evenings and one morning in one week. They quite often will show up for days, leave and return. -Amy Harmon Cramer
*
I went out to
Washington Park - Rosario Strait
, overlooking Burrows Pass (SW Anacortes), to do a Harbor Porpoise survey. Only saw 4 Harbor Porpoise but at
4:30 pm I heard blows that were not from any porpoise. A Gray Whale had just entered the east end of the pass, blew a couple times, dove and resurfaced at the west end of the pass. Love field work, you just never know what you'll see. -Pattie Hutchins
*
Took a comp day and spent several hour scoping from various West beach locations. While looking at some harbor porpoises, a shape appeared behind them, disturbing some gulls and auklets on the water. I continued watching and saw a form rise and clearly saw the scimitar shape dorsal fin come up a couple more times. It scattered seabirds each time it rose. This was just
south and a bit west of Smith Island at about
3:15 pm
. This is my 2nd ever
Minke
sighting with the 1st being years ago when one crossed the bow of the ferry coming from Port Townsend. Not long after
a pod of at least 4 orcas came through between the island and the beach
- very close with lots of splashing! Whales rock!! -Steve Ellis

I went out to Washington Park, overlooking
Burrows Pass (SW Anacortes)
, to do a Harbor Porpoise survey. Only
