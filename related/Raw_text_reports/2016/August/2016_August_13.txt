The
T65As swam down San Juan Channel
. They were hugging the shoreline. -Monika Wieland

We headed through the San Juan Islands and found
whales hugging the shores south of O'Neal Island, and heading towards Friday Harbor
! We traveled with these whales -
the T65As
- into the Harbor on a very busy Saturday afternoon, sharing the water with ferries, whale watch boats, private boats AND float planes, wow, what a sight! After a brief visit the whales continued towards San Juan channel, stopping for an active meal en route. What a treat to spend time with this family group....-Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist Mystic Sea

2:30 p.m. -
We live on Sutherland Rd, off Turn Point Rd (San Juan Is.) and today at about
2:30pm, we saw from our living room windows,
a pod swim East of Turn Island going South
. There may have been
3 or 4 of them
. (including 1 adult male) Lots of whale boats following them and even a few boats from Fisherman's cove on Lopez came across to see them. It's the second time we've seen them here. Always the biggest thrill! We love it!! -Nancy Larsen
