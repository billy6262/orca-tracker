This afternoon was quite magical.
Js and Ls in a few different groups
being super social and playful as they made their way towards San Juan Island. Glassy water and massive clumps of whales. Hope they are finding enough to eat. -Traci Walter

, what a killer
morning

6:40 -
Jack Burchard reports
4 orcas heading south into Admiralty Inlet near Port Townsend
, about mid-channel.
*
Another beautiful day on the Salish Sea! We left the marina with news of resident orcas west but quite far and not moving much, but headed south west to find
humpbacks
. Which we did! With reports of multiple sightings, we were watching one, when Captain Eric spotted a big breach back toward the north east. We caught up with
Split Fin BCZ0298 (2006 offspring of BCY0324 Big Mama) and Heather BCY0160 about 5 miles north of Dungeness Spit
, and watched them fluke up tail dive, skim along the surface, and even have a close encounter (with engines shut down!). Thrilling to see these big, majestic whales feeding along the current lines and one huge breach that we're hoping a passenger captured on film! Also spotted some adorable harbor seals, harbor porpoises and bald eagles. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

7:15 p.m. - Spotted Common dolphins at Chambers Bay
they were closer to the Fox Island side around
6:00 heading South then came back up again heading north just now. -Soun Nonthaveth-Moffett
