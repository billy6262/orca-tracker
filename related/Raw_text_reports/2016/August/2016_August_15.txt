Orca Sightings for August 15, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Approximately

4:30 pm - K12s and K13s northbound at Hannah Heights and Land Bank
. Some foraging, some shuffling but general northward direction, slow and spread. Too far away at that point to get individual IDs.
Once they got to Lime Kiln they flipped and headed south
, grouped up into family groups, came in close to shore and began porpoising south.
Passed Hannah Heights southbound at approximately
6:15
. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network
*

1:23 p.m. -
Saw some
Orcas passing Lime Kiln state Park
. Someone there said it was K pod. -Sarah Ehle
*
...With reports of some of the Southern Residents (fish eaters) inbound we left the transients searching for lunch, and soon encountered
K-pod leaders off Discovery Island, B.C.
heading at a fast clip towards the west side of San Juan, one of their traditional foraging areas. Passengers had their breath taken away by the sheer magnificence, beauty and grace of the whales as
the rest of K-pod powered past
, their dorsal fins slicing through the waves and the sound of their exhalations carrying on the wind. Our return journey took us past Whale Rocks where Steller sea-lions ('wildlife with attitude') basked in the warmth of the afternoon sun - thanks to Captain Eric for yet another memorable day at sea. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea

A fair swell greeted us as we headed out through Rosario Strait and past Lopez towards Victoria, B.C., where the
T65A's (five transient orcas, a female, sprouter male and three youngsters) hunted for prey among the kelp off Trial Island, B.C
. With reports of some of the Southern Residents (fish eaters) inbound we left the transients searching for lunch, and soon encountered
K-pod leaders off Discovery Island, B.C
. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea

Humpback whales - central/south Puget Sound
- We received a call at about

8:20 pm
tonight from Rosemary Teforo who was calling from Vashon Island, at the end of Manzanita Rd. They were watching a whale 500 ft. away from shore, going back and forth, headed toward Portage, had been there at least 10 - 15 minutes. They thought it was in trouble, seemed to be very close to shore. They confirmed it had a dorsal fin, so not a gray whale feeding. At
9:30 Rosemary's sister Elizabeth called, saying it was still there,
100 yards from shore
, breathing a lot and they were afraid it was stranding. While I was on the phone with them I got a message from Amy Carey - she couldn't get there before dark, but called a friend who lives near there, and her friend had been watching it for the last 45 minutes. It was at the
mouth of Quartermaster Harbor
, a place they don't usually go, but it seemed to be doing deep dives and breathing and acting normal, and they saw it breach and species was
confirmed as humpback
. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
