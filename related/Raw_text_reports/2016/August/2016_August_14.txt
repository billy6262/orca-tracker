Sunday we started with heavy fog, so Capt. Monte took us through the San Juan Islands, to the north end where we had whale reports of K-pod whales "in thick fog". A good choice - by the time we arrived with the whales the fog had lifted and the sun was shining!! We identified members of the
K12 and K13 matrilines, very spread out along the shoreline, traveling southbound past the Center for Whale Research and San Juan Island's the West Side Reserve
. Many many breaches, what a thrill for us all to witness. It's such a privilege to see our Resident whales in the Salish Sea again, let's hope they'll find enough chinook salmon to keep them here. Homeward bound we found seal moms with pups, harbor porpoise, turkey vultures and a bald eagle. A foggy day turned into a truly beautiful day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

This morning we got out to
Lime Kiln at
11:45 AM just at the K12s and K13s were flying past
heading north in the fog, barely visible from shore. Luckily the fog lifted before
the same group came back south between
2:00 and
2:30
, fighting against the strong flood tide. -Monika Wieland
*
Orcas at Point Hudson, Port Townsend. We saw 4 or 5 of them
heading slowly north at about

11:00 a.m.
8/14/2016. Possibly one male. They were close to shore, about 200 yards from the beach. Closer than R2 navigational buoy. -Jeff McLean
