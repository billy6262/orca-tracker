Male & female off Westside preserve at
7:35 AM heading down island
. =Jack Collins

1:27 a.m. - Calls on Lime Kiln now
! Really loud! -Ali Barratt
*
We caught up with the closer group of
T46 transients about 6 miles south of Lopez
and spent a lovely time with five of them, most traveling fairly fast south west. Included in this group were
the female T46
, who is estimated to be 52 years old, and was the last orca captured in Budd Inlet, in Puget Sound, in 1976, and released. She is now a great-grandmother! Also seen were T46E, a young male who was born in 2003, and T46D, another young male, born in 2000. Both of these bulls have already "sprouted" (dorsal fin growing) to impressive size... -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

0820 - three orcas in San Juan Channel headed south
along Shaw Island shoreline. -Breck Tyler
*

7:40 a.m. - Transients passing off the west side of Yellow Island in San Juan channel
. -Julia Wallace
*

7:30 p.m. - Unidentified killer whales - Orcas, 2-3.
Only saw backs and dorsal fins briefly from our deck on shore. It is very unusual to see them so close to shore. They were being followed by Orca Spirit II and another smaller boat. Very calm seas and no wind. The sighting was
just offshore in Ross Bay, Victoria, BC. Between Clover Point and Gonzales Bay
. They were much closer to shore than we have ever seen them. Headed East towards Gonzales. -Jeanette Jeffery

11:52 a.m. - Puget Sound - Gray or humpback south side of Fox island
. -Jill Goodman
*
...We then headed a bit more south toward Dungeness Spit, and found
a humpback off the southwest corner of Eastern Bank - Juan de Fuca
. We got great looks at this beautiful baleen whale with a 100% black underside of the tail fluke. It's always amazing when we can hear their big exhalations and see their gnarly heads! -Bonnie Gretz
*

10:15a.m. - We had a gray whale feeding just north of Spee-Bi-Dah in Port Susan Bay
. First noticed about
10:15 am and continued to feed until
11:00. Definitely feeding. -Malcolm Lindquist,
