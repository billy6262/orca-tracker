Entry 1:
In the

, we saw a pod of
about a dozen orcas of lighthouse Park in Point Roberts
. They where traveling south. -Stieny Klomp

2:21 p.m. -
They're now offshore of
Land Bank
facing south not really going anywhere.

2:00 p.m. - They're just approaching Land Bank
. Seem spread...Milling, some offshore some in shore, but still trending north at the moment. -Monika Wieland
*
It was the
L-121 Windsong
show Tuesday morning from the shores of
Grandmas Cove (American Camp, San Juan Island)
. He was quite energetic with multiple breaches, rolls, pec/dorsal/tail slaps. L94 Calypso and her son L121 Windsong off south San Juan Island. Whales came within 100' of shore. -Ariel Yseth

3:29 a.m. - Very faint calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone
behind the vessel noise! -Ali Barratt

T11A skulking around east of the mouth of the Elwah River
. -Mark Malleson

Whale Sighting.
4 orcas
traveling. My Son-inlaw sent this picture to me
off the spit in Port Angeles
today. He said there were 4 of them 2 babies and 2 adults. The dorsal fin of one of them was about 5 feet high. He also heard from someone that they traveled into the Port Angeles bay by the coast guard station. -Doris Williamson

At one point about
50 yards off shore at Point No Point
. We watched from about

7:50 until
8:20
as it was feeding
between Norwegian Point and Point No Point
, just meandering. -Marilyn DeRoy
*

7:06 p.m. - Seeing a humpback off of Norwegian Point Park in Hansville
. Surfaced several time. Spectacular with the sun reflecting off its body and dorsal fin. -Mike and Jenn Szerlog
*

14:37 - Common dolphins off Meadow Point (Golden Gardens, north Seattle)
, 400 yards out: I'm either looking at harbor porpoises on crack, or those are (un)common dolphins tearing it up! Slowly undulating south, jumping completely out of the water and making my task of doing the dishes slightly less mundane. -Ben Blankenship
