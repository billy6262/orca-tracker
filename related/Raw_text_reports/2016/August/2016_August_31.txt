Orca Sightings for August 31, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our evening trip.
Star, J46
. I'm giving her a 10 on her forward lunge breach! -Capt Jim Maya
*
Even though it's still summer, this felt like a fall day! But captains Monte and Eric steered us through the raindrops to first get a good look at
a lone gray whale by Kellet Ledge in Rosario Strait
, then headed up toward
San Juan Island to catch up with some of K pod and L pod
. We got great looks at the young male
K25 Scoter, lovely female K20 Spock and her son K38 Comet
, and a few more males and females, approximately 10 whales. They were quite active, breaching, tail slapping, spyhopping, porpoising, some hunting for fish, and generally headed first south and then west. Even though it was cloudy, the water was glass smooth, creating beautiful patterns as the whales surfaced and dove, with their big "whoosh" of breath announcing their presence. What a privilege to see them, as always! ...-Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
