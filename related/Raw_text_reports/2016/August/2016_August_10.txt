Orca Sightings for August 10, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
I don't think I've ever seen
so many transient (mammal-hunting) orcas together at one time
.
T065As, T018/T019s and others with Vancouver city in the background.
Usually these orcas rely on smaller numbers and stealth to exploit their intelligent prey. However, this massive grouping of matrilines stayed in the same spot in the Strait of Georgia doing circles for HOURS in the same spot, predating on harbor porpoise occasionally and interacting with one another. Lot's of vocalizations, social behavior, and breeding ... others even joined in the ceremony later in the evening, probably hearing their vocals some miles away. It was simply an incredible thing to observe. -Heather MacIntyre

...we sailed on up to East Point to see
a large group of T's socializing between East Point and Pt Roberts
. I recalled seeing the
T65A's, T18/19's, T46's
- I think some members of the 36's were there as well. The vocalizations were incredible and T19B aka 'Mr Floppy Fin' breached multiple times. Mind = Blown! -Barbara & David, All Aboard Sailing

6:00 p.m. - South Puget Sound. 20+ common dolphins traveling back and forth (north and south) north of Boston Harbor/Budd Inlet
. A freighter just came in (
7:30) and they are following its wake further south into Budd Inlet. VERY active. -Kim Merriman

Looks like
10-13 harbor porpoise (
?
) visiting Case Inlet about
10:00 this morning
. As of
10:30 they are heading South....They were smaller and played with a passing boat. Jumping and "porpoising". (reported as porpoise but behavior and size of pod
sounds more like the dolphins
- ALB) -Bev McCallum

Saw a sweet
porpoise
family while out SUPing on Wednesday. They were feeding and stayed in the area be
tween Shilshole and West Point
, Seattle. The baby was so tiny! -Brittany Lynn
