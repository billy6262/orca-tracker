Orca Sightings for August 7, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:30 p.m. - Fin whale in Colvos Passage, seen from Gig Harbor:
I Heard this whale blow about
12:30 and just happened be standing there with my camera and a 100-400 lens. (see photo below) It was diving when I got the first pictures and it stayed down 2-3 minutes then blew again. I saw no tail. I didn't see it again after the second dive. -Archelle Reynolds

2:00 p.m. - I saw it (fin whale) pass Olalla headed north around
2:00PM
. It was close to shore and, like you, I heard it blow before I saw it. It looked just like your picture. -Steve Henderson
*

9:06 a.m. - Either a humpback or fin whale in Mukilteo
just south of the ferry dock slowly heading south right now. -Lee Anne Tobin

Puget Sound (live strand) - She was moving around
Fauntleroy Cove at day break
when WS Ferry staff first took notice. They called it in as
a sighting and then a stranding
once it was clear she was in distress. As the tide receded, she beached and lovely devoted humans did their best to keep her comfortable. I arrived about 15 minutes before she
took her last breath just before
11:00 a.m
. As the tide continued to ebb, her beautiful young body lay more exposed. From her appearance it was clear she was emaciated. Her long graceful white pec fins stood out. Researchers and staff from all entities, NOAA, Cascadia Research, DFW, Seattle Aquarium, Stranding Networks, Seal Sitters, and probably others were present. Much gratitude to all responders. A prelimiary exam was conducted telling us she was a
1-1/2-3 year-old juvenile and she is 39 feet long
. Many of us naturalists lined along the ferry dock answered questions through out the day. She was towed in the evening at high tide to a private location for full necropsy. This is nature's cycle, and maybe humans somehow played a role in her death, we will not know until results of a full necropsy are shared, either way it is sad such a young being lost her life. Looking in the eye of a giant creature who has just passed is a moment etched in my being forever. I am relieved she did not have to suffer too long under her own weight. Rest little one. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

9:15 a.m. - Two Humpbacks and a Minke off Westside
preserve heading up Haro Strait. -Jack Collins
