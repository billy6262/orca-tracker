Another beautiful sunny day and an early whale report took us north along Bellingham Channel on a search - Resident Killer Whales far far up north in Canada, but another whale watch boat saved the day by finding
Transient/Biggs killer whales north of Patos Island
! The whales were heading away from us at a fast clip, and spread out, we had some great looks at the
T65s and T34s, with possibly some T37s in the distance
. A nearby harbor seal avoided detection by these mammal eating whales - it was his lucky day! After some quality time watching these magnificent mammals, we reluctantly left them, finding seals with new pups on several rocky haulouts, harbor porpoise and many bald eagles en route back to port. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Traveling out of Everett heading towards Mukilteo Thursday morning,
August 4th,
spotted a whale breaching (surfacing?)
that had a blow hole or nostral visible, and then as it breached, approx. 25-30 feet back came up a small curved fin, approx. 18"-24" tall. Never had seen anything like this before, so researched when we got home and
looks like it was a fin whale

Humpback MMZ0004 (Malleson/CWR catalogue)
dorsal and fluke compilation photo. One of the few humpbacks encountered in Juan de Fuca Strait. So when a
humpback
heads directly towards your boat, most would zoom their lens out, but I was intriged enough to just leave it.
