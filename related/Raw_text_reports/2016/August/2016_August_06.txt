the captain came on the loudspeaker and announced orcas were on the starboard side! I jumped out of my car and raced to the front of the boat where I saw three frolicking!

The attached pictures were from
a Humpback whale
sighting on Saturday,
August 6th. The location is
just North of Shilshole marina
out at mid channel: Starting Coordinates at approximately
11:30am: N47043'.84 W122o24'.84. Moving in a southerly direction over the next 30 minutes that we watched. The cow put on a continuous show for as long as we watched. We believe there was also a calf at her side but was hard to confirm from our distance. N47o43'.67 W122o25'.03. -Michael Spruch
(
This report and beautiful breach sequence are of (and a nice tribute to) the female juvenile humpback the night before she live stranded in Fauntleroy Cove, West Seattle the morning of
August 7th. Sadly she eventually died while being cared for by a team of researchers and stranding network staff and volunteers as reported on in our
August 13th Whale Sightings Report - ALB
