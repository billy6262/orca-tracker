Orca Sightings for August 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We celebrated
the return of K pod
who had been MIA from the inland waters for months. We've never seen all of K pod MIA from the Salish Sea for so long and were incredibly happy to see their familiar fins again. Hopefully there's enough salmon here for them now that they will stay. -Heather Macintyre

9:30 a.m. - More Southern Residents down south
. -John Boyd

6:35AM - 4-5 Orcas heading up island off Westside Preserve
. -Jack Collins

Large pod of
Common dolphins this morning in Dan Passage
- Puget Sound. -Chris Hamilton,

Entry 2:
*

9:30a.m. - South Puget Sound. Olympia. Large pod of common dolphins (20+) mid-channel between Budd and Eld inlets
. Very active/feeding along the tide rip. Even squealing! -Kim Merriman

...we had a brief visit with the
T18/19's in Upright Channel
as they were headed east before we ventured off to see the
T99's, T36, T36B's (?) and the T38's outside of Fisherman's Harbor, Lopez
. I am still sorting through photos but I believe the 36B's were there as well. They ended up hunting/milling for quite some time near Big Rock and also in Griffin Bay before making a brief visit to the Port of Friday Harbor. I heard they continued north and took Spieden Channel. -Barbara & David, All Aboard Sailing

Prof Fujita is visiting the Whiteley Center from Japan this August and snapped a photo of Bigg's in Friday Harbor. -Masahisa Fujita

...
Rosario Strait
where we immediately found two groups of transient orcas -- the
T36s and the T99s off of James Island
. We stayed with these groups as they made their way through
Thatcher Pass and on to Upright Head
. After leaving these two groups, Mystic Sea continued on towards
Blakeley Island where we found another group of transients, the T18s
. We stayed with this group for a while as well. In total, we saw approximately 16 whales today -- which did tail slaps and spyhops while in our midst....~Amy W., Mystic Sea
