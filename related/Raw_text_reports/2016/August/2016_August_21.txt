Orca Sightings for August 21, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a call from Loren Goldman in Vancouver tonight, he was reporting
a pod of ~ 10 orcas off Pt. Roberts, 7 pm
, breaching, tail lobbing, and more for 40 minutes, then traveling from west to east toward the San Juans. He said he this summer has been the worst for seeing whales (this was one of his first times this summer), and that he had heard that it was the worst season for Chinook salmon in BC in over 100 years.

5:20 p.m. - Orca off Clover Point
, Victoria, but such crazy winds we lost them. One large male with one other. Very close to shore mixed in with kiteboarders.... A mother and baby ended up
corralling a seal right up to the rocks of the Oak Bay marina!
(We were parked off beach drive) We followed them up
till 8pm
when they turned back to Trial Island...All together there were
6 transients
. Markus says two females, one baby and three males. But at first we saw only two males and one female but then three more appeared in Oak Bay. -Maria Peronino
