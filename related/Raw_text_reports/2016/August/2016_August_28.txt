============================================================

Entry 1:
T011 and T011A this afternoon south east bound off of Pillar Point, Clallam Bay
, WA - Juan de Fuca Strait. -Mark Malleson
*

7:00 p.m. - San Juans - Orca Sighting - Wasp Passage and Harney Channel
. Saw a group of
at least 4 orca
whales heading east past Crane and Bell Island toward the Orcas Ferry Terminal from my deck on the east side of Crane Island. -Bethany Shimasaki
*

15:00 - Bigg's killer whales.
I saw three killer whales head south, pass
Brown Island
(San Juan Channel). I was watching from Observation Park. Thank you to the Whale Museum letting me know they got notice that Transients will passing in front of Friday Harbor. -Page Smith
*
We found
two groups of 6-7 transients between Spieden and Sentinel Islands
. One group was lunching on a seal when we arrived on scene. Mystic Sea stayed with this group as they traveled towards Green Point, stopping for food several times along the way. While feeding, passengers were able to watch as these orcas spyhopped, breached, and slapped their tails - preparing their prey for consumption. -Amy W., Mystic Sea

Playful
Transients off Spieden Island this morning
. -Monika Wieland
*

10:40 a.m. - Transients in Spieden Channel
hugging the south side of Spieden shoreline-westbound north of Sentinel. Looks like 2 groups total of
8-10 orcas
, surfacing and long dives. Several boats including a huge yacht that thought they were a whale watching boat. -Peggy Mauro
*

6:19 p.m. - Humpback at Point No Point
harassing boater? The humpback is
following a boat
, going under, tail slapping and seemingly pushing the boat. Boater appears to be trying to back away but whale is staying with them. Seems like the boat either pissed the whale off or it is in love :). Looks like the whale has moved on. Wish these boaters would keep their distance better. -Patty Michak
(
some "friendly" humpbacks are curious enough to approach boaters and interact, we call this a mugging, it is benign - ALB
)
*

5:41 p.m. - One or two whales going north in front of Point No Point
right now. Probably humpbacks. At one point we saw a tail coming straight out of the water. -Judy Anderson Soupe
*
Humpback in Skunk Bay around 10am
. 1 milling around a boat and kayaks, then headed south. -Lisa Cheever
*
Another great day on the water ...
20+ Humpbacks just west of Sooke, BC. - Juan de Fuca
-Paul Pudwell
*
Spotted
four harbour porpoise swimming past East Point, Saturna island around 8.00pm
today plus plenty of seals. -Sandra Arthur
*

12:00 Noon - I saw at least 3 harbour porpoises while I was surfing at Hobuck Beach in Neah Bay
. They were swimming together close to the surfers, for at least an hour. Closest the came to me was about 20 feet. It was about high tide, around 12 pm. -Jeanne Cavenaugh
