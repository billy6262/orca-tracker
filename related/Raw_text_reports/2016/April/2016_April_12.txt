Orca Sightings for April 12, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Received a call at

7:00 pm
from Rob and Marilyn Hrycenko,
Honeymoon Bay
, to say that whales were passing their window (again) and
heading into Holmes Harbor for the 4th day in a row.
... By the time we arrived at the Beachfire dock at
7:15 pm, the whales were in our sights powering through the waves and whitecaps. About 500 yards from the dock they seemed to have a change of plan, turned and went back north! Difficult to say how many whales were present due to sea conditions and fading light, but Marilyn thought she saw about ten. The best ID shot we obtained shows Doublestuf (J34) and maybe that's Cookie (J38) ahead of him. These whales are certainly setting quite a pace for us landlubbers trying to keep track of them. -Sandra Pollard & Richard Snowberger

3:04 p.m. - Orcas seen from Toby's in Coupeville
. just saw a pod of orca. At least 4 of them. Looked like some young ones with the larger ones. One orca had a very large dorsal. Just traveling out of Penn Cove. -Steven Iezzi
*

2:59 p.m.
- they just went past
the pier in Coupeville
, seemed to be moving quickly out of the cove, in the middle of the cove,
think there are 6 - a few are little dorsals.
-Shanna Petersen

2:30 p.m. - Report of Orca in Penn Cove

Ts were amazing...the
T99s and T36s show the many stages of a Steller Sea Lion kill
.
Haro Strait, off of Mitchell Point
. -Capt Jim Maya
*
Passengers aboard M/V Peregrine and Imagine with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching got to witness some special behavior from our
mammal-hunting Bigg's killer whales today! The T036A and T099
family groups participated in a successful sea lion predation event. Observers had the chance to view some incredible surface behavior like breaches, tail slaps, head-stands etc. Those behaviors were all incredible to view, but in our opinion the best part was the aftermath, when these killer whales lit up the water column in beautiful vocalizations. -Heather MacIntyre

T049A1 harassing a steller sea lion in Middle Channel in the morning

12:53 p.m. - south Puget Sound - This gray whale
wandered into the Foss Waterway and right down to P-Dock. Probably one of the coolest things you'll ever see at Foss Harbor! Thanks to marina tenant Jim M. for the great video! (video is of the juvenile emaciated gray whale that has been traveling up and down Puget Sound the past month- ALB) -Ian Wilkinson Marina Manager, Foss Harbor Marina
