4:35 p.m. - south Puget Sound - Just saw a small Gray Whale (I think) heading NE in Pickering Passage
north of Walkers Landing. It was very small and close to my beach. I think there was another out in the passage because the gulls and duck things were going crazy farther out in one spot...like they were eating parasites off something just under the surface. Awesome.... Life is good. -Katje Hansen

Gray whale was in Eld Inlet around noon
.
*

*
However, I believe I saw it last night, too, near the tip of Cooper Point at Budd and Eld inlets. Today it headed south into the inlet to near Flap Jack Point and then turned around and headed north - very close to shore as seen by this image taken from my beach. It continued north passing by Steamboat Island,
under the Harstine Island Bridge
, and then kept going. Slow and shallow surfacing series right near the beach/shoreline. -Kim Merriman
