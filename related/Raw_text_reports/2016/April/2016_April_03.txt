Orca Sightings for April 3, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
(afternoon trip): On yet another glorious day, we encountered
gray whales #56, 383 and 723 shortly after leaving Langley marina
. It's not often we see
three gray whales traveling so closely together
, a truly magnificent sight against the backdrop of the snow-capped Cascade mountains. After rounding Gedney Island and
heading north up Saratoga Passage, we spotted #21
, one of our returning males whose identity is rather unique - this whale does not show his flukes. Once again another wonderful day with our visiting gray whales. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea
