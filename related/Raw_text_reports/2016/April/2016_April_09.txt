============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30 a.m. - 5 whales spotted in Holmes Harbor
, - J17s & J22s. They were about 100 yards off our beach. We are located just about a 1/4 mile north of Dines Point. Traveling. -Lynn Fallows
*
In the late evening light I was blessed with a beautiful pass by the
J17s and J22s in Saratoga Passage
. I finally got to "meet" J53 and J54! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

J-34 Doublestuf, watching from Shangri La Shores over towards Camano Island

Day report and photos: Incredible to see the
J-17s on the EAST side of Whidbey Island
!!! (slowly moving north from Greenbank Farm). At first we assumed they were transients, but after closer looks at open saddle patches, and especially J-28 Polaris's notched dorsal fin, it was obvious. They were leisurely spy-hopping numerous times, gliding through the glass smooth late afternoon spring sunshine. What a thrill to see them, and of course, the darling babies! -Bonnie Gretz
*
Day report and phtos: Today was spent chasing
J pod up and down the east side of Whidbey
- I followed them from noon until just before 8pm. I spotted them at
Hidden Beach where they went deep into Holmes Harbor
, then traveled north all the way to just south of Penn Cove, last seen at
Hidden Beach headed south
. I ran into so many orca loving friends along the way, I laughed so much, enjoyed the sunshine, and closed off the night enjoying dinner with beer and friends. Just another day on Whidbey. -Rachel Haight
*
Day report and photos: What a dilemma - with whales reported on the west side of Whidbey and then on the east, which way to go? Opting to follow up on the Orca Network report of whales heading south in Saratago Passage on the east side, the day took on many twists and turns. Tracking them proved difficult as
they went deep into Holmes Harbor, but they were visible fleetingly at
2:15pm
from our doorstep (a rarity indeed). After turning back towards Baby Island, the whales headed north in Saratoga Passage, passing
Hidden Beach around
3:30 pm
accompanied by Mystic Sea, who observed they were with possibly
11 members of J pod
. Spy-hops, breaches, and logging behaviors were all seen from shore as the whales moved in leisurely fashion north in calm, clear conditions between

4:00 and
5:00 pm
, until eventually disappearing from sight in the distance. A truly amazing day to have Southern Residents so close to home. -Sandy Pollard

Watched though a spoting scope so much easier to see and count then the sighting ( which likely was the same group) that was seen from shoreline on Thursday.
