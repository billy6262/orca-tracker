slow steady pace southbound. Shallow surfaces in 3-4s every 8-10 minutes in glassy water. No fluking though one does arch on last surface. Carkeek would be next place for shore viewing...they are probably almost due west of there.

...We were promised rain but were lucky - we headed out to find
gray whales and right off Camano
, directly opposite Langley, we found
#44 Dubknuck
feeding along Camano's shoreline, heading slowly north. After watching him feed on his side with one pectoral fin and half of his tail visible, he then come out to deeper water and we saw his tail fluke several times. We then headed south towards
Hat/Gedney Island
and found
#723 Lucyfer
feeding along the southern shallow banks. He was very visible near the surface, we could see his entire body in the shallow water. Heading back to port, #44 had turned south and we saw him again! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
