Anna Gullickson of Kenmore Air just sent in this report: A fellow pilot just spotted a pod of some type of whale about 5 miles South of Smith Island at
3:36 pm. She thinks maybe Fin whales? She thinks there were about 4 of them. They are dark grey, almost black w/ a bit of a white understreak. They were feeding on herring balls w/ the seagulls and that is how she spotted them.
