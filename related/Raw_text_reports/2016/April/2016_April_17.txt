Orca Sightings for April 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon at
2 PM
we met up with
transient killer whales
moving quickly north from
Kelp Reef in Haro Strait
. We were with
T11 and T11A
, and a little ways ahead of them (identified by others) were the T
46Bs and possibly T46C2
("Sam"). After traveling with them for about 20 minutes, we headed back over towards San Juan Island where we picked up the
J16s heading north at Mitchell Bay around 3 PM. We followed them to Open Bay, where they met up with the J19s, and continued north
. All members of both matrilines were present, and we left them still heading north from Battleship Island around
4:15. -Monika Wieland

Afternoon cruise - Finally got to see some of our
North Puget Sound Gray whales
today! Lots of fluking going on, sadly did not get any good photos of Patch, but we got to see him! And
#383 and 723, south east of Hat/Gedney Island
. Thanks to Mystic Sea, our great volunteer crew, and all who came with us on our Orca Network fundraising cruise! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

5:05 p.m. - Multiple blows east of Hat Island
. They seem to be heading south-I took a few photos but they are pretty far away. Looks like at least two or three. -Sharon Ann Clark
*

4:05 p.m. - Two grey whales rising,
just now at Driftwood park (by the Keystone ferry) here on Whidbey! Heading South along the coast, pretty slow. -Courtney Wilson
*
We also saw
#383 in this same area, at about
3:45
. -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

2:03 p.m. - #49 Patch southeast of Gedney
. Feeding in about 40 feet. -Renee Beitzell
*

4:18 p.m. - south Puget Sound -
I don't know who is in Olympia right now, but there is
a gray
snugging the shoreline. It
came north out of Budd Inlet around
2:00
and headed south into Eld. It is now slowly making its way back north. Very shallow areas. Beauty blow! This is the same gray whale from yesterday, who was in deep south Sound (Budd Inlet then Eld Inlet) before it headed north passing under the Harstine Island Bridge. Apparently it returned some time during the night and started the route all over again. -Kim Merriman
