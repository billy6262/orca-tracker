Gray sighted from Clinton ferry
Saturday evening. I was on the Clinton ferry about
6-
6:30
on Saturday,
April 2, and we saw a gray whale. It was a few hundred yards south of the boat, mid-channel. We saw three or so blows, then a tail, then nothing more for the rest of the trip--we assumed it dove. Too far away to get any details or markings. -David Freed

This big
Gray (on it's side, pec fin up) was seen with another this afternoon
from Mystic Sea along the
Tulalip shoreline
feeding. Eager scoters ready to munch on the leftovers. Richard Snowberger

2:30 p.m. -
my friend and I were at
Haines Wharf Park (Edmonds)

southern end of Whidbey Island, we saw three gray whales
