Orca Sightings for April 23, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient Orca super pod all traveling together - 65A's, 49A's, 123's, 65B, 65B1 and others
were making their way to the group. -Brian Goldberg

EPIC day with the
T49A's, T65A's, T65B's, and T123's! A little ways north of Protection Island
. Incredible action from these guys: pirouettes, double breaches, super spyhops, sea snakes, and mid-air barrel rolls. Here are images of orcas defying gravity. -Katie Jones

Transient Orcas socializing. North of Protection Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca

...Later that morning we got a report of killer whales
near the mouth of Puget Sound between Admiralty Inlet and Port Townsend
. When we got on scene I quickly identified the commonly known
T065As, T065Bs, T049As, T049C, and T123s
. I had not seen T065B and T065B-1 in quite some time, so that was exciting! I just love these large groupings of mammal-hunting killer whales (Bigg's/transients) we see in the spring! I wonder what initiates such groupings, but I suspect the reason is ecological. We saw hundreds of breaches and displays of social behavior. This is usually very rare for these types of killer whales because they need to be very quiet and stealthy in order to exploit their intelligent prey. They must have all had very full bellies ... I think the orcas spent more time out of the water than in it! We saw back flips, spyhops, cartwheels, breaches, head-stands, and heaps of tactile behavior.... -Heather MacIntyre

Incredible encounter with
3 transient pods in Admiralty Inlet
. -James Gresham
*

12:17 p.m. - they are steadily traveling NW on their way out of Admiralty inlet
. Harder to see now - will be out of sight from Whidbey soon.

11:49 a.m. - At Fort Ebey state park, can see the pod mid channel
. I've seen some crazy surface activity in the few minutes I got here. Water like glass and easy to see. -Rachel Haight
*

11:12 a.m. - Transient orcas at Ebeys Landing
northbound. Out on Redhead, amazing activity and vocalizations. -Trevor Tillman
*
With much better weather conditions than originally forecast,
gray whales #49 (Patch), #383 and #723 put in an appearance between Gedney Island and Everett
in search of their favorite food source, ghost-shrimp. For much of the time #383 and #723 were traveling together, with all three whales changing direction frequently and intent on feeding. Just getting on with life. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist, Mystic Sea
*

12:04 p.m. -
Just got back in from gray whale trip from Edmonds with Puget Sound Express. Watched
two gray whales north of Everett
fantastic morning...
Gray whale #383 was north of Everett
. -Karen Knight

We encountered
BCY0160 "Heather" the humpback right outside of our harbor early on. (Snug Harbor)
I'm grateful that we have these gentle giants in the Salish Sea again. They were nearly eradicated by one whaling station here at the turn of the century but are making a huge comeback, known affectionately as the "humpback comeback"! This is Heather's 14th consecutive year here according to researchers. Interestingly enough, she was the last humpback I saw here last November. -Heather MacIntyre
*
.....As if the day wasn't epic enough we also encountered
a Minke whale
(second smallest baleen whale in the world) on the way back to our harbor. (
Snug Harbor
) As Jared Towers documents in his 2014 publication on seasonal movements and ecological markers as evidence for common minke whale migration, I also observed numerous cookiecutter shark scars on this individual which was very interesting! This individual must have just gotten back to its summer range... -Heather MacIntyre
