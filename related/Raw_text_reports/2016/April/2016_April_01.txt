4:02 p.m. -
the ferry Chelan called in a report of
6-8 orcas in the traffic lane from Lopez to Anacortes
, frolicking around with no clear direction of travel.

Approx.
3:50 p.m. - Orcas sighted from ferry Chelan while heading from Anacortes to Orcas Island

Gray whales #383 and 21 off Tulalip and #723 off Gedney Island
earlier today. -Langley Whale Center

Another wonderful day on the water today, no April Fool's joke!
Three whales were found - starting with #723 feeding along the south side of Gedney/Hat Island, and then #383 and #21 were feeding together near Tulalip shores
. Lots of "on their side" feeding behavior and some dives, many looks at #723 and #383's flukes. #21 has a very old injury that prevents him from showing the underside of his tail....well documented, but no known reason for the injury. We were also lucky to spot a flock of Brant geese on their migration to Alaska for their summer breeding. April is starting off well! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Today brought a repeat of the beautiful sea conditions but this time with
2 Humpback whales! "Heather" BCY0160 and an unknown since it wouldn't show its fluke! Near Patos Island Lighthouse
. -Traci Walter
