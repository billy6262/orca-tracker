while they were having dinner. -Sandra Pollard

I thought you might enjoy these photos from the
J-pod visit to Holmes Harbor
today. We had the
J17 and J22 subpods in there all day today
. Feel free to post them on the orca network email list. What a fascinating surprise to have residents in Holmes Harbor, and I'm still scratching my head a bit wondering what their purpose was? They seemed to be resting, socializing, playing, and just wandering around during our two visits with them on the Island Explorer 4 today. -Bart Rulon

again! Assuming it's the
