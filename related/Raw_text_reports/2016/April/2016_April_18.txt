12:07 a.m. - Just saw a gray whale in lower part of Eld Inlet
. It was incredible!" -Jace Cotton

Trip report - In record breaking temperatures we headed out to find whales - the water was so flat and beautiful we could see for miles. Wasn't too long until we found
#44 Dubknuck and #49 Patch
feeding side by side, very
near to Camano Head
. They were in shallow water, it was so calm we could even see them underwater, a most unusual sight. We then headed
further south and found #383 and #723 Lucyfer
, also feeding together
by Hat/Gedney Island
. They too were in shallow water, too shallow for any fluke dives. We really didn't want to return to port because it was such a wonderful day being out on the water. But - we had to. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
