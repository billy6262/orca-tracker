Orca Sightings for April 14, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a wonderful encounter with the
J16's south of Secretary Island (near Sooke)
! They had been picked up by Ocean Magic and we were the second boat on scene and soon identified the J16's but could see other Orcas further to the west. We were the only boat on scene and watched the J16's playing around with each other being very tactile. They were slowly heading back west but in no great hurry. It was great to see J50 & J52 playing together. -Andrew Lees, Five Star WW

Dall's porpoise pestering
J27 and J31 off Sheringham Point
. -Mark Malleson
*
The
J22, and J17 subpods
were spread out for miles exhibiting lots of foraging behavior as we watched from the Island Explorer 4 around

11:00am
today. J35, Tahlequah, took a break to breach 3 times in a row along the southern shoreline of Whidbey Island, just south of the ferry lanes. Also included a picture of gray whale 531 who was swimming very close by as J-pod swam through. The foraging behavior became even more intense
at Possession Point
where we left them heading mostly southwest. (see gray whale section) -Bart Rulon

Unless they turn around, it seems
J17s & J22s visit to Saratoga is finally over
. It was nice to be able to catch them at Possession State Park as they went by this morning. -Rachel Haight
*

6:00 p.m. - Reporting a pod of 6 orcas seen traveling south past Kingston
. No boat traffic anywhere near them. Traveling and feeding undisturbed. -Carol Anderson
*

5:52 p.m. -
Just saw some from the
Edmonds Kingston ferry Kingston side. 4 or 5
... very active. Headed south. -Anouska Willett
*
While at
Double bluff at
1:15
I thought it looked like they turned
south towards Point No Point
(keeping to Puget Sound) but I got thrown off by an exiting WW boat so headed to south Mutiny Bay, found Rachel, but no J pod (we scouted there until 3pm). Have good hunch they are around Eglon or south by now. Bart said a lot of foraging behavior earlier. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
I'm the "smaller craft," they headed out toward the middle of the channel and then disappeared. We were with them for a while just
off of Indian Point in Useless Bay
. Brian Berry

12:51 p.m. -
they seemed stalled - line of sight from
north Edmonds
is the dark V midpoint Double Bluff, Whale boat still with them as well as a smaller craft

12:36 p.m. - they are headed westerly
. Line of sight from north Edmonds is Double Bluff. -Stu Davidson
*

12:11 p.m. - We are at Possession Beach Waterfront park and 3 or 4 orcas just passed by heading south around Whidbey Island
. -Harriet Sparling Arnold
*
Noon - Possession Point
now, lots of foraging. -Bart Rulon
*

11:55 a.m. - At Possession Point
: whales spread out and some long downtimes. Westbound around the south end of Whidbey, headed for Admiralty it appears. -Rachel Haight
*

11:50 a.m. - From Haines Wharf Park, north Edmonds I could see dorsals rounding rounding Possession Point
at the south end of Whidbey Island, looking like they're heading for Admiralty Inlet. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

10:56 a.m. -
We just received a report from Bart Rulon from Island Adventures they are with the J
17s and J22s who are southbound south of Clinton Ferry
terminal in Possession Sound very spread out heading towards Possession Point.

Gotta love the baby face! We were with the
T86As, T37, and T124A1
today! Our captain/owner of Western Prince Whale & Wildlife Tours of sighted them by land! Such a special treat! I had not seen the T86A's since March of 2013! It appears that T86A has a new calf, but waiting to hear confirmation from the Center for Whale Research. Her last known calf was T86A3 which is to the left of this image with the large nick up top of the dorsal fin. So curious to hear what they have been up to the last couple years and how long they might stick around! -Traci Walter
