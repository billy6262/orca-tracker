Orca Sightings for April 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Finn Gatewood of Whidbey Island, who at

7:15 pm
was in the lobby of WICA (Whidbey Island Center for the Arts) in Langley, and saw some whale activity out the window. Judging from the behavior and number of whales, she believes it was an orca pod, and they were
heading north up Saratoga Passage
. (unconfirmed SRKW, but J pod was in Saratoga next morning
April 9)
*

2:45 p.m. -
Langley Whale Center volunteer Shari Devlin reports seeing
several Orcas from Possession Beach
, S. Whidbey Island. Mid channel, no direction given.

Two reports relayed by Renee Beitzell from boaters at Edmonds Marina of
a pod of orcas in north Puget Sound at approx.
11:20 past Possession Point
. Neither reporting party gave details as to which way the pod went, up Admiralty or up Possession Sound towards Mukilteo/Clinton.
