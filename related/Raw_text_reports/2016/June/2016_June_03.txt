============================================================

Entry 1:
3:25 p.m. - Killer Whales
right out front off Sooke heading west now...
and a humpback a mile south of Secretary Island
.

11:07 a.m. - Many many orca heading west from Victoria now! L pod, and?
Should be around Sooke in a couple hours. -Paul Pudwell, Victoria, BC, Canada Sooke Coastal

. -Mark Malleson

L Pod and Race Rocks and the Olympic Mts. and the Elwha Valley
! -Capt. Jim Maya

We were with
L pod
today! This is the first time they have been in the area this season so it was very good to see them. They were really
spread out and foraging off Victoria, BC
so it was a challenge to know where to look or point the camera. Again, a good problem to have! Two of the most recent calves born into the pod,
L122 and L123
were there and look fantastic, in my very un-expert opinion. Two adolescent boys hanging out - L105 Fluke (born 2004) & L106 Pooka (born 2005).
L103 and her 7-month-old offspring L123
. Also got to see one of my favorites, L92 Crewser, who was having his very own photo shoot with Center for Whale Research. -Renee Beitzel

L pod
is back! Here is a highlight of today's encounter with
Lpod off Victoria
during our morning tour. This was the first time Lpod had been seen in the Strait of Juan De Fuca this year! -Andrew Lees
*
Transient Orca pod off Crescent Bay
, Washington... just west of Port Angeles. Seen about 9am. Slowly heading west. There were
about 8 of them
. 1 big male, looks like a sprouting (juvenile) male, 2 maybe 1-2 year old calves and a brand new baby (still dark orange) as well as 3 females. (ID'd as
T75Bs & T77s
by Sara Hysong-Shimazu). -Don Baker

Juan de Fuca - As we left the marina (Anacortes), we heard of
L pod heading west off Victoria
. Captain Monte decided to make the long run and hope to catch up with them. It was a magnificent day, warm and sunny with flat glass smooth water. We made good time, but as the tide turned, the whales sped up and eluded us! The good news is that
L-91 and her calf, L122 were seen
, as was most of L pod. This is the first sighting of L pod this spring. We did spend time with
a lovely humpback on Constance Bank
, due south of Victoria, BC. His/Her tail fluke looked to be 100% black, making identification very difficult, although he/she had a very distinctive gray patch behind the dorsal fin. On the way back, a large group, perhaps 15+, of harbor porpoises were also feeding. It's unusual to see so many together! Also seen was a mature bald eagle, enjoying lunch on the edge of Lopez Island. Another lovely Salish Sea day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea

I was taking the ferry from
Vashon to Pt. Defiance on the
8:00 pm ferry
, and saw three splashes...It was clearly a whale. But it was far away -
between Pt. Defiance and S.W. side of Vashon
...Then I saw all the boats turn and gather round. I never got any images. And, there is no way I could have ID's the species. (
unconfirmed humpback
, but one was reported same area next morning). -Kim Merriman
*

7:30-
8:00 a.m. -
My husband & I were treated to an amazing humpback show of one this morning....with a lazy pattern of antics - on its back and slapping its fins on the water, frolicking, diving, then breaches. We are located
just north of Edmonds
... Whale was in between us and Possession Point on the
south end of Whidbey
. He/she was slowly heading north. -Laurie & Paul, Edmonds
*

7:10 a.m. - Humpback whale juvenile sited at Olympic View Dr and Sunset way. (Edmonds)
Was not moving for at least 10 minutes in same place rolling over a bit no breaching. Saw tail. Very very slow moving. From our home 9100 block Olympic View dr looking north west on Puget Sound. Pretty close in, could see easily with naked eye. -Starla Sage
