Orca Sightings for June 28, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juans - Ken called Dave at home in the morning to relay a report of
transients heading north at Land Bank
. Dave headed over to CWR and could see the whales off Bellevue Point from the porch a little before 1000. By about
1025
, the whales moved in and the young whales hunted briefly at the reef
in front of CWR before continuing north
. These whales were the
T36's, T99's, and T49C (nine whales total)
and they were loosely spread out as they passed CWR. We later heard that the
T73A's passed Lime Kiln about an hour later
...Excerpted from CWR Encounter 60 -Center for Whale Research

Sightings of transient mammal-feeding orcas have been astounding this year..Another incredible day with
approximately 7 different matrilines (over 20 whales) doing some crazy socializing near Mandarte Island!

10:30 a.m. -
We first watched the
T36's, T99's, and T49C from shore at Land Bank
(west side of San Juan Island, WA) who looked to be finishing up a kill. They then moved northbound at a slow-medium pace, as they continued on we could see from the distance they cut in very close to the rocks at Lime Kiln. We missed them there but got ahead of them at
County park
and watched them pass slowly northbound - some nice lazy tail lobbing, looking to be winding down into resting. We left County Park as they were in front of the Center for Whale Research around
10:30am. (per CWR:
T36's, T99's, and T49C (nine whales total)
