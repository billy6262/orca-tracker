Orca Sightings for June 4, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
On board the Peregrine with Captain Jim he had a report of
T124A's Biggs killer whales in Canada
.
Up Haro Strait, up Swanson Channel and into Trincomali Channel
where we caught up with the still northerly bound
T124As off Wallace Island
. They appeared to have prey with them as they would travel a bit and then pause for predation behaviors such as directional changes, tail slaps and deeper dives. This pattern continued most of the time we were with them until at last they picked up the pace as we bid adieu. Beautiful backlit blows, calm water, and great looks at a wild and free family. -Debbie Stewart

I was just heading home from a walk and
a humpback
surfaced about 25 feet out from the beach (
Gig Harbor side), it was moving north up Colvos
, feeding and blowing frequently, it probably was at Sunrise Beach 30 to 45 minutes ago. -Michele Riley Campbell
