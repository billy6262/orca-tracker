Orca Sightings for June 11, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:40 pm -
Looks like they all came together, good group of orca now just
east of Otter Point
foraging on salmon, no direction, maybe west.
Noon - At least a dozen Orca at Sherringham Light
house an hour ago heading east, and many orca off Beachy Head heading west. -Paul Pudwell in Sooke, BC

Had a message this morning from Carrie Newell reporting a pod of
5 - 6 orcas heading north past Depoe Bay, OR
in 138' of water
June 11th at

12:30 pm
. The pod included 1 lg. male and a juvenile, and there were also
two young gray whales
near the shore, that stayed there as the orcas went by. She has not yet had time to go through photos to ID the orcas.

A challenging trip with wind and confused seas as we headed
out of Cattle Pass towards the Salmon Bank marker
, where a number of Steller sea-lions were doing a precarious balancing act. After passing the marker at

12:45 pm, we spotted the distinctive blow of a humpback
whale among the whitecaps. Lucky to get these two shots as we bounced around in the waves, but a calmer trip home! -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

A gregarious, unidentified
humpback waves hello North of Spieden Island
, Saturday. -Steve Smith
*

6:47 p.m. - Puget Sound -
Beautiful sunlit huge blows and arch into deep dive - definitely
Humpback
!

6:38 p.m. -
now I'm thinking I'm seeing
multiple Humpbacks in the East Useless Bay area
. Last blow was a lot closer and the whale was westerly.

as seen from
north Edmonds
.

6:31 p.m. - Whale blows! (Guessing Humpback)
- East of yellow buoy off of east Double Bluff (south edge of Useless Bay). Believe direction is easterly. -Stu Davidson
