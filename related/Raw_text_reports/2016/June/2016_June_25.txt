Orca Sightings for June 25, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tonight was a beautiful evening spent with the
T137s & T124C between Orcas Island & Peapod Rocks
. T137A & T124C traveled next to each other through the entire encounter, with the rest of the T137s not far off. No words to describe how much I love those backlit blows. -Rachel Haight
*
3- 4 orcas off SE Lopez Island at
4:10 pm
, going back and forth hunting/foraging, then heading south along the island. -Veronica von Allworden
*
The
T036A's and T075B's
never disappoint in the evening! These two family groups, called matrilines, make a deadly combination for any harbor seals in the area they're traveling through. These individuals are notorious for playing with their food ... punting a seal some forty-ish feet in the air, blood splattering everywhere, insane vocalizations, incredible social behavior, sunshine, engines off, and enjoying this without any other boats on scene for the majority of the time...Between Blunden Island and the Saturna shoreline. After already killing this Harbor seal, one of the Ts punts their prey some 40 feet in the air. Shows the power and precision of these mammal eaters. -Heather MacIntyre

We caught up with the
T123s near Skipjack Island around
2:15 PM
. They were looping all over the place. First they seemed to be aiming for President's Channel, but then they followed
along the north side of Waldron to Sandy Point
. Just when it looked like they might aim south to San Juan Channel, they flipped north again, then went west, and finally
east across Boundary Pass
. For whatever reason, they decided not to intercept the other group of transients that had just made their way down Swanson Channel. At
3:30 PM we left the T123s and headed over to the other group heading east along Pender Bluffs, made up of the
T36As and T75Bs
- six whales including two one year-olds. They were all slowly traveling in a tight group, and with their more predictable surfacings it was easier to get a good view and snap some photos. When we decided to peel off and head home around
5:15 PM, they were just at the bottom of Plumper Pass, seemingly undecided as to whether to head north or continue east. -Monika Wieland
*
T049C in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on Saturday afternoon
. He's been swimming with 42 yr old female,
T091
who has no surviving pod mates for the past several days. When we got on scene with him she was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly he breached and began pounding the water with his flukes. He swam over near us and submerged. A couple minutes later she appeared in a strong tidal rip on the opposite side of the boat from where he'd been. She took a breath, submerged and they disappeared. Sneaky T's. Here one minute, gone the next. -James Gresham
*
Humpback CS631 aka 2 Spot lunge feeding near Sook
e on Saturday afternoon. (She spent most of late summer and winter 2015/2016 in Puget Sound) -James Gresham
*

4:52 p.m. -
We are with what we think is the same whale that we saw a few hours ago. It was heading northwest and we are now out in the Strait. Still moving rapidly but west now. It's a juvenile gray whale! Looks to be ok.

1:39 p.m. - One gray at Marrowstone point/ Fort Flagler
, feeding. Only saw once, then dove. -Renee Beitzel
*
Erin Cora and others at Orca Sing report
Nick and another minke spent time off Lime Kiln
during the ceremony.
*

6:00 p.m. - They're back...both minkes, including Nick Jagger, southbound past middle Land Bank
. Nick leads, surfacing with his head above water, very cool. They traveled south and stalled in the rip, swimming against the current drifting north.

8:35-
8:55 a.m. - Again from Land Bank...a northbound minke
, different than earlier whale. Connie ID'd this one as Nick Jagger. The guy was being all active, looking to be lunge feeding. Sweet! Bob Otis said the past few days they have been seen going past the Lighthouse northbound. Minke doing a west side shuffle.

6:00 a.m. - At Land Bank/West Side Preserve
, San Juan Island getting enjoying the peace that comes with early morning on Haro Strait when suddenly surprised by a large whale with dorsal breaking the surface of calm seas. Turns out to be a
Minke traveling southbound
. Few surfaces then deep dive, continued in this pattern until out of sight at
6:18 a.m. Beautiful morning! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON
*

6:00 p.m. - Nick Jagger
is trying to swim south against the flood tide but really not going anywhere. Evening southbound pass in
Haro Strait past Land Bank
, west side San Juan Island. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Minke whale
"Nick Jagger" on a
8:30 am
morning northbound leg of a day spent shufffling up and down the
west side of San Juan Island
from shore, Land Bank/West Side Preserve. -Connie Bickerton
*
I just saw the
commons again on the south side if Elliot Bay at 1745
. Same size group
8-15 or so
. In water taxi route so couldn't spend time with them. Did get this far away video (viewed, but not able to share here), but if you can zoom you can at least see they are Dolphins. -Christopher Howard
*
Several
Harbor porpoise
foraging through out the day, from sunrise to sunset, 200-300 yards off
Land Bank/West Side Preserve
(between north and middle), San Juan Island. Most seen at any given time 6+. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

1:07 p.m. -
A large group of
something
is active nor far off of Sunnyside Beach in
Steilacoom. Probably porpoises
, but not the usual visible dorsal fins that we see so often. They appear to be feeding.
Guessing 15 or more
. We are pretty high above the sound, and I was observing through binoculars... I caught glimpses of shiny sides sporadically, but no clear dorsals. The tide is fairly low and they were perhaps 30 yards off shore. Hard to gauge from here. Most of the time, there were three distinct groups of them, with the water visibly agitated around each group. Sorry to be so scant with details! -Tari Poe Norris
*
Noon - There was a small pod of about 3-4 harbor porpoises in Henderson Bay
, Gig Harbor at around noon today. They happened to swim pretty close by us. -Anne Mae Anderson
*
Humpback CS631 near Sooke
, BC flick feeding. I had never witnessed this before Saturday. When a humpback flick feeds it stands on it's head in whatever the food source is and sweeps the flukes up and forward, concentrating the food source in front of itself. It then simply opens the mouth and engulfs the food source. -James Gresham
*

8:35-
8:55 a.m. - northbound Minke whale "Nick Jagger".
The guy was being all active, looking to be lunge feeding. Sweet encounter from
Land Bank/West Side Preserve, San Juan Island
. -Video by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network,
