Orca Sightings for June 29, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
T137A. He and T100C (both 14-years-old)
were having a breaching contest last night.
North Rosario. Neptune Beach/Sandy Point
in background. (The T137's have become one of my favorite families in recent years, as we watched this young male try to attack two adult grays this spring (#56 and #531) near Camano Island. This family also skinned a harbor porpoise and launched it out of the water several years back right next to our boat.) -Michael Colahan

Around
12 noon
, while in town we got word that
two bulls were northbound in San Juan Channel
. Marilyn Armbruster and I headed for Reuben Tarte County Park on the north end of San Juan Island where we arrived in time about

12:35 to watch these two big guys
navigate the waters headed north at a steady pace. We could see they were
angling west towards Speiden Channel
so we Reuben Tarte around
1:00 & headed to a friends place on Spieden. From shore we watched them continue westbound maintaining a steady pace on the north side of the channel. At one point they looked like they might head south but eventually turned northwesterly and we lost sight. We left around

1:30 p.m
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Possible
humpback sighting at Talequah ferry area (Dalco Passage) at south Vashon Island
today approximately

8:30PM
. Lots of fluking and tail slapping. Exciting! -Ann Melone
*

8:20 p.m. - Two humpbacks spotted about 50 yards offshore of Marine Park near Point Ruston in Tacoma
, heading toward Quartermaster Harbor. Big blows, big sounds, lots of tail flukes. -Ranell Nystrom
*

4:10 p.m. - We found the 2 humpbacks south of Three Tree Point
.

4:01 p.m. - They are in the path of the ferry between Fauntleroy and Vashon
now. Possibly heading North. -Eileen Wolcott
*

12:30 p.m. - Humpbacks are near Elliott Bay
, we can see a Harbor Cruise vessel with them.

11:34 a.m. - These two humpback whales are movin'! Passing Discovery Park
now, still east of channel, heading south.

10:23 p.m. - Humpbacks heading south past Richmond Beach
, Humpbacks are one from last year and a smaller one...

10:02 a.m. - And 2 humpbacks between Kayu and Richmond Beach
, right by the beach. -Janine Harles
*

7:40 a.m. - Two large whales just sighted off Jefferson Head in Kingston heading North
. They did have dorsal fins. Both were blowing. Irregular surface, not smooth. Dorsal fin not remarkable. Blows were sizable. I would say humpbacks. -Nancy Langwith
*
We found
one of our very well known "Saratoga grays", #723 "Lucyfer", heading south just off Edmonds
on
June 29. If I am not mistaken, he was the first of a small group of grays to arrive this year and was spotted in late February (
February 17th by ON staff- ALB). The grays are usually gone by now as they will feed on the outer coast for the summer and have only been known to come in to Puget Sound for about a month and a half (Feb/March-April/May) to feed on ghost shrimp. It is now July, so this is rather alarming since he should be gone by now. Hoping his reasons for staying behind are that he's finding plenty of food in here still. The fact that he was not in Saratoga and heading south toward Seattle is a little worrisome. Generally, when a gray whale is found around Seattle or south of it, they are juveniles that are lost and/or already dying. We headed south on our second trip and found humpbacks again, but not "Lucyfer". Hoping we will see him again and that Cascadia is able to monitor his condition if he stays. -Renee Beitzel
*

10:56 a.m. - The humpbacks are heading south towards Shilshole
, still on East side of channel,
Gray whal 723 Lucyfer was mid channel between Point Wells and Kingston heading South
, we will try to pick him up again later.

9:59 a.m. -
We (Chilkat) are with
Lucyfer #723 grey Whale off of Point Wells!
! He is currently heading South. -Janine Harles
*

8:44 p.m. - dolphins
are still out. Just to
north of Southworth ferry
right before the turn to Vashon. -Joslyn Cynkus Mintz
*
Common dolphin mom and calf central Puget Sound
. -Renee Beitzel
*
Common Dolphin in the Fauntleroy/Vashon ferry lanes
. There were about a dozen, so cute, and had a baby with them. -Janine Harles,
*
(
reported as orcas, but more likely this is the pod of
Common dolphins
seen later in the same area. We had no other reports of orcas in Puget Sound
)

11:52 a.m. -
just sighted several Orcas moving across in area of Portage and Vashon Island..north of Point Robertson. Just saw them moving across surface, no breech. Looked like 3 or 4. Nothing moving now. -Laurie OBrien
