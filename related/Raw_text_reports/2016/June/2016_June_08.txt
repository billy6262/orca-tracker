Orca Sightings for June 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
This is the evening cruise 6-8-16 with Jim and April, we followed this
Humpback from North of Battleship, to Stuart Island
. At one point it even looked like it was going into the Harbor at Pender. The juvenile humpback we had did have some markings that might help in any ID's. I didn't get a good tail, but I have several of the Left side dorsal on down to the flukes and to me it looks like this humpback even has possible propeller scars? -Cher Renke
(
We sent the below and several other of Cher's photos to Cascadia: "I do not think these are prop scars which tend to have a very distinctive look with multiple cuts in a pattern. The ones shown here could come from any of multiple sources including entanglement." - John Calambokidis
