A pod of killer whales - probably five
- was spotted and photographed as it traveled north this weekend at
Yaquina Head on the Oregon Coast
! Tourists and BLM staff at the lighthouse quickly gathered Saturday at the Yaquina Lighthouse to witness the rare sight. The entire passing lasted about 10 minutes - long enough to be a "truly wonderful experience," according to BLM staffer Meredith Matherly. "It was a first for some of us and definitely made our evening - week -- lives?!" wrote Matherly via email. Amazing photography courtesy Mitch Rohse, Bureau of Land Management Oregon(
