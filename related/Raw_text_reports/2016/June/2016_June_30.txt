Orca Sightings for June 30, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
With an early report from a ferry captain of
Transient (meat-eating) Biggs orcas north of Orcas Island
, we headed out into the sun/clouds, hoping they wouldn't continue north too far. We caught up with them just south of Matia Island, west of Bellingham. This group was identified as the
T100s
, and included a large male (
T100C
, who is only 14 but quite big already!),
about 4-5 females, a very young orange-tinted calf, and another calf who was approximately 2-3 years old, T100B & T100B2 (First seen
May 30. Mom was seen
May 22 with no baby)
. They were extremely active, spy-hopping, breaching, obviously hunting though we didn't see any actual prey. The male must have tail-slapped at least 50 times during the time we spent with them! They were swirling around, changing directions, grouping up together, then split apart a bit to hunt some more. Very exciting to see these magnificent predators going about their business while we watch in awe! Also saw 5 bald eagles and some chubby harbor seals with their pups. On the way back to the marina, we stopped to admire the beautiful and varied landscape of the islands. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
