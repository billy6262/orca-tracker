L55 Nugget Saturday evening on Salmon Bank

L123 near Salmon Bank
, off south San Juan Island on Saturday
evening

...At
1242, about two miles east of Race Rocks
a fin briefly appeared in the choppy gray water beneath a darkening sky full of moisture. This is the Pacific Northwest, after all. The encounter nonetheless began. The first group of whales encountered were of the
L47 matriline - grandma L47 with daughter L91 and her 10 month old son, L122
. The six year old male,
L115
, was with the group, and
L83 with L110
were several hundred yards off their right flank.
L90 and L92
were a bit further off, and some whales (leaders) were reported to already be nearing
Constance Bank
and travelling quickly at about 9 knots with an incoming tide.... -Center for Whale Research

Kasatka L82 breaches off Lime Kiln State Park
. Taken from shore. -Melisa Pinnow

We had the
L4s, L26s, L47s, and L72s pass Lime Kiln
so it was a pretty good number (
L54s off False Bay
when everyone else was at LK)

3:32 p.m. - Most passed LK offshore
but they've flipped and are heading slowly south against strong flood.

3:00 p.m. - Very spread, most may hit north of Lime Kiln
. -Monika Wieland

2:24 - Orcas on Lime Kiln hydrophone

11:04 p.m. - Many SRKW coming in east from Sooke
! -Paul Pudwell

While conducting Encounter 54 with
L pod Residents heading east off Victoria
, a report came in of
Transient whales heading out on a near collision course on the southeast edge of Constance Bank
...The Transients were travelling in a close knit group and heading southwest outbound, passing within one mile of the Residents heading east inbound. This is one of those rare occasions where the Resident and Transient ecotype whales nearly overlap in habitat use in time and space....-Center for Whale Research,
