Orca Sightings for July 13, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
WOW.
L Pod passed Sooke late this afternoon
and nobody even knew. Keep You eyes peeled. THEY ARE BACK! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke, BC,
*
J41 Eclipse
saying hello today.
All of J pod met this evening on the west side of San Juan Island
, and L pod are reported as incoming tonight. -Barbara Bender
*
Amazing evening with
J-Pod
! It was an epic pass at
Lime Kiln
. The party continued up the shoreline. Later (on the water) we left
most of Js northbound at Battleship
then ran into the
J16s just north of Kellett
on our way home. So funny we're hearing Js making L calls and I said Ls must be on their way in! (reports of Ls in Strait of Juan de Fuca heading inland). -Monika Wieland
*

5:16 p.m. - Vocals and Echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. -Melissa Mikey Howes
*
Around
2pm, Saw about 7 orcas off of Western Preserve, SJI
. I'm guessing J pod? they were heading south along the coast. One adult and one juvenile continued south. Another group with one large male (someone near me said so, but not 100% sure), two other adults and two juveniles headed south along the coast and then turned out toward Victoria/ more open water. -Julia Wallace
*
Trip report - It's always good to hear that whales are close by, but really exciting that they're
members of J-pod
- still in our waters - and hopefully finding enough food! We headed towards the west side of San Juan Island where they were doing their "west side shuffle", traveling very close to shore, and were able to identify J
-26 Mike, J-16 Slick with her calf J-50
, and several other members of the
J16s and J22s (and possibly the J17s
) - always a delight to see them. We had a fleeting glimpse of
a Minke whale
on our return trip, with several Steller sea lions resting on a channel marker, some harbor seals, and eagles. And it was a really beautiful sunny day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
*

1:30 p.m. - Faint calls/echolocation on Lime Kiln
right now! -Mandy Johnson
*

12:54 p.m. - Faint echolocation on the Lime Kiln hydrophone!
They started chatting as soon as I posted yesterday so let's see if my luck continues! -Amy K Fowler
*
Humpback whales -

Entry 2:
Juan de Fuca
- Oh today. You will go down in history as one of the few days where I'm utterly speechless. To see such an incredible scene in nature with one's own eyes, creates such pure happiness that I carry for life. I love encounters with any wildlife, but there is something extra special about those whales. I had an incredible encounter today with
nearly 30 Humpbacks
in the general area we were in. (Strait of Juan de Fuca) Lunge feeding, cartwheels, and lots of tail flukes in the air! Oh, and we also saw Killer whales. -Traci Walter
*

4:00 p.m. - Puget Sound - Humpack went past Point Defiance, Tacoma and north into Colvos Passage
. -Zeno Martin,

Entry 3:
*

3:00 p.m. - This is how close it went by the shore and the houses at Salmon Beach, Tacoma
. -Kim Merriman,

Entry 4:
*
Approx
12:45 p.m. - Watched this humpback very close to shore at Chambers Bay golf Course
. Headed north, toward Narrows. Slow surfacing, breathing. No fluke. No jumps. Very mellow pace, but steady. No boats near. Came within 100 feet of shore. Stayed under for a bit while a train passed, then continued easy surfacing and still north bound. -Dean Burke
*

9:10 a.m. - Humpback surfacing with blows between Ketron abd Steilacoom
as seen from the 9 am ferry! She/he was heading south along the shoreline between Ketron and Steilly. I saw her/him on the west side of Ketron first, but thought I was just being optimistic given all the sightings lately! -Danielle Vance
*

7:50 p.m. From Johnson Pt, saw a pair swimming toward the point.
6:41 p.m. - Neighbor saw the dolphins
about a half hour ago from Johnson Pt. over toward Taylor Bay. -Joan Ahre

Gray whale sighting off of Chambers Bay Golf Course (south Puget Sound) at 7am and 8am
. Headed North into the Narrows as the tide turned from low to high. (
Unconfirmed gray, there was a humpback in this area at this time - ALB
) -Raphael Barry
