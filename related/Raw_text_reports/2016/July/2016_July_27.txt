Orca Sightings for July 27, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Most of J pod had been spread out down San Juan Island all morning while J2, L87, the J16s, and the J19s had been found in Boundary Pass
and were heading south around Turn Point. Dave headed down to Snug Harbor in the early afternoon and left aboard Orcinus to go and pick up Ken over in Oak Bay on Vancouver Island. By the time Ken and Dave came back across Haro Strait, the southbound J pod whales were in Andrews Bay....Photos and full encounter report at CWR Encounter 75. -Center for Whale Research
*
Sailed to
False Bay where members of J pod group B were foraging close to shore while group A was coming down from the north a little offshore. J27 Blackberry
breached multiple times leading a track to Salmon Bank.
Granny
was in the mix of the group B whales. Between the two groups was
a pair of humpback whales
. We sailed together to Salmon Bank and then all whales headed to Hein Bank and continued west into the sunset. -Barbara Bender
*
I'm still reliving the amazing encounters. We watched the
J11s (J27, J31, and J39) traveling with J2 and adopted son, L87
. They sure seemed to be in high spirits ... J2 Granny (oldest southern resident orca) looking gorgeous. She and J27 spent more time out of the water than in it! And then there was
that humpback
that popped up surprisingly in the distance breaching over and over and over ...-Heather MacIntyre

2:40 p.m. - West side. They just passed quickly - L87 still offshore. J16s and J19s plus J2 with J26
! -Monika Wieland

J42 and I are on a roll! Here she is breaching by Monarch head
this morning! -Gary Sutton,

Entry 2:
*

7:20 p.m. - 3 to 4 orcas in St of Juan de Fuca between Dungeness Spit and Ediz Hook
. Viewed at
7:20 PM from bluff at private residence on Osborn Rd mid-way between Dungeness Spit and Ediz Hook. 3 to 4 individuals only 1 male seen. Heading west towards Port Angeles. -Michael Scuderi
*
Wednesday morning started out foggy, but the skies cleared and the sun came out just as our cruise was getting underway. We found the
T65s near Peapod Rocks
. We sat and watched them for quite some time as they fed and slapped their tails. As these 5 transients began to travel northbound, so did we. Just a bit further on we found this group of
transients again near Sister Islands
as they continued to feed and slap their tails! We spend an additional 45 minutes watching them before our return to port. - Amy W.

While watching the
J11s....this humpback breached in the distance
, and continued breaching over and over and over. -Heather MacIntyre,

He appears to be feeding and swimming in tight circles in the open water

outside of Gig Harbor. Humpback
traveling and breaching several times from Point Defiance to Kent/Des Moines. Very large in size in comparison to past sightings. -Darin Edwards

5:57 a.m. -
I'm sure I just saw a
whale off Alki
. Looked just in time to see a big hump then a tail come out of the water then it was so gone. Anyone else see this guy? Was heading west towards Southworth/Manchester. As viewed from just off 54th place and Alki.-Rusty Garner

9:40 a.m. - central Puget Sound - Dolphins off Ballard buoy
just now. The north buoy by Golden Gardens. And it was hard to tell which way, but I would say north. (direction of travel) It was pretty foggy. -Ryan Johnson

7:00 a.m. - south Puget Sound - Common dolphins very active heading north out of Budd Inlet
. Flat calm and foggy is making a great backdrop. -Kim Merrman
