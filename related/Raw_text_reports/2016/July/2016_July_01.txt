San Juan Clipper on scene now! He's head

Ann Casey of Whidbey Audubon called while out in a boat checking her crab pots and seeing a whale that from the description
sounds like a gray whale, close to shore near Sandy Point
, at the south tip of Whidbey Island.

I heard blows and I spotted what I think was
a small Gray Whale in the middle of Saratoga Passage
swimming southbound toward Langley at about
8:00 am this morning. -Sydney Lynn Wolcott

...I also observed
a small group of orcas on
July 1 in the vicinity of East Point, Saturna. Male is T137A

Saw
6 Orca being mobbed by whale watching boats, between Turn Point
(US side of Boundary Passage) and Fairfax Point (south end of Moresby Island), east of the marker for Helen Rock (I think it is called?). They were traveling steadily northwards, but I didn't see exactly where they headed. Gotta love these work days, -Frank Gee, Parks Canada staffer
