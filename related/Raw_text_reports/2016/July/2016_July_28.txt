Just spotted this
Gray (or Humpback) whale in Admiralty Inlet
heading south, just above Lagoon Point, about
8pm
. Figured it was a Gray since it was only the one and because of the spout, but I can't say for sure. (reported as Gray, but humpbacks have been consistently present). -James L. Bogart
*
Pod of Common dolphins - Olympia, WA
-Laurie O'Brien,

Entry 2:
*

5:50 p.m. - Common Dolphins are "screaming" south down Eld Inlet
. What a lovely (and fast) sight of them porpoising just below the surface, throwing a wake, with every single animal. Throw in the total breaches once in a while and it's a grand night on the water. -Kim Merriman
