Last watch they were headed south off Alki lighthouse mid channel at 530pm

4:15 p.m. - We had some great sightings off Bainbridge Islands Rolling Bay
when a pod of
about 10 Orcas
milled around feeding. There were what appeared to be a couple of young orcas being instructed on hunting for food, many long dives for short distances and you never knew where they would show up next giving a couple tour boat riders a treat, here's a few of the shots I took. Milling in Rolling bay and feeding then they split with some heading towards mid channel and 3-4 staying on the Bainbridge side heading south when we finally went back to sailing. Last count was around 8-10 in the pod. -Gary Peterson
