Entry 2:
*

8:30 p.m. - We saw several whales (no dorsal fin, so not Orcas) on the crossing of the Coho between Victoria, BC & Port Angeles, WA
in US waters. They appeared to be feeding, and heading west on Strait of Juan de Fuca. We did see the tail flukes of 2, one very close and distinct. One of our group got a video of them blowing and the tail of one, though it's fuzzy. We dont know if Grays or
Humpbacks
have been seen in the area, but that's best guess. -Elizabeth Blake

Jess Payton took this picture of the
fin whale on Saturday about 4pm South of San Juan Island
, from the Blackfish San Juan Island Whale and Wildlife tour. Captain Tom did a great job getting us close -- but not too close -- to see several surfaces. -Sheryl Geuder Payton
