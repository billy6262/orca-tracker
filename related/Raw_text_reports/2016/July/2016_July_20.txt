Orca Sightings for July 20, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
So glad to finally catch up with the
L12 sub-group
today! They've been around for a few days, but have stayed in southern
Haro Strait
and out at the banks. Today they finally rode a huge flood tide up and made it north of Lime Kiln! L
77 Matia and her four year-old daughter L119 Joy off Lime Kiln State Park
. -Monika Wieland

L85 slowly passed LK until
19:25
. He was south of the light, offshore but not out of sight.
L77 and L119 came fairly close. L94, L25, L113, and L121 weren't too far offshore and grouped up together
. It was a nice time watching them and just good to see them. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Entry 2:
*

5:04 p.m. - Watching one large orca and one small slow diving in tide churn off Eagle Point
, San juan for last 20 mins. We're at grandma's cove and facing into sun, so can't get a good pic yet. -Krista Paulino
*

4:33 p.m. - L pod
coming up. Might be a good time to sit at the
Landbank
. -Ariel Yseth
*

4:15 to
4:45 p.m. - Off the west side of San Juan Island we watched the L11s, L25 (and believe the L22s)
very spread out foraging, but in general trending northbound. We first encounter
L41 who was a mile or more offshore
heading inshore away from us. At first it was difficult to get a sense of how many whales were present as they were very spread out. We then spotted L25 as she swam a bit more inshore steadily northbound.
L119 and mom L77
were nearby. The two separated for a short time when L77 seemingly alone headed in our direction then turned parallel several hundred yards inshore of us and just behind L119 who was full of spunk. After a nice breach, L41 eventually turned in and approached others inshore as did
L55 & L119
where eventually all the L11s (heard the L22s were there too) grouped up and porpoised for a minute somewhere around Pile Point. Once huddled in a tight group they resumed a steady northbound course interspersed with tail slaps by little ones. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

10:00 a.m. - 2 adult male orcas at Eagle Point, San Juan Island
.
T65A4, T65A5, T65A3 scouting the southern strait of Georgia just before they came upon a pod of harbor porpoise
-Ariel Yseth
*

2:09 p.m. - Just saw them NNW of Orcas
this morning.
T65A2
spent a lot of time chasing a porpoise unsuccessfully but so fun to watch.

Pod of
5+ Orcas Pod sited off Long Beach Peninsiula, Washington
. Feeding. -Eileen Crookes

5:20 p.m. -
After watching the
L11 and L22 subpods off San Juan Island
, we headed south to see the
many humpbacks
that have been feeding in the area
north of Dungeness Spit
....In the distance...the
fin whale
was spotted by the naturalist so we went to check on that individual and caught glimpses as it powered through the waters then disappeared for several minutes only to surface on our starboard side much close to the boat. We watched fin surface several times while humpbacks lit up the horizon with their blows. A magical time on the waters of Juan de Fuca. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

5:20 p.m. - After watching a couple of subpods of resident L pod (L11s & L22s) off San Juan Island
, we headed south to see the
many humpbacks that have been feeding in the area north of Dungeness Spit
. We arrived on scene around
5:20 p.m. where we lay witness to a most beautiful sight, approx 25 plus humpbacks surfacing and blowing as far as we could see. We watched as groups of anywhere from 2-6 traveled in tandem, blowing and fluking near, mid a far. Some surface activity in the distance as several would pec slap and roll, but otherwise mostly circling whales and sun illuminated blows. A paired popped up near the boat, another group of 3-4 surfaced and logged for several minutes nearby. In the distance...the fin whale was spotted by the naturalist so we went to check on that individual and caught glimpses as it powered through the waters then disappeared for several minutes only to surface on our starboard side much close to the boat. We watched fin surface several times while humpbacks lit up the horizon with their blows. After about 30-40 minutes it was time to head back. A magical time on the waters of Juan de Fuca. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

25+ Humpbacks & 1 Fin whale - north of Dungeness Spit, Juan de Fuca Strait

Entry 3:

6:00 p.m. - On the return trip after watching Ls off San Juan Island and humpbacks and a fin whale north of Dungeness we came upon a minke whale approx 2 miles west of Point Wilson
foraging in glassy calm waters. We watched her/him make a wide circle first heading south then north where we left beautiful minke about
6:15 p.m. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
