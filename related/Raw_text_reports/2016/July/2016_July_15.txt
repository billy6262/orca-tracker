Orca Sightings for July 15, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern resident (salmon eating type) youngster
L119 Joy with a deceased Harbor porpoise in her mouth
. She was observed
off Salmon Bank (south end of San Juan Island)
pushing , flipping, and playing around with the porpoise for quite a while. -Janine Harles
*
We encountered
Four-year-old L119 Joy playing with a dead harbor porpoise at
7:30pm 2 miles W of Salmon Bank marker
. She was all by herself flinging it, holding it in her mouth by her teeth, and draping it over her rostrum. We first heard radio reports of an L pod whale playing with a dead harbor porpoise about
3:30/4pm. I included some photos for reference - fully zoomed and cropped to show as much detail as possible. -Barbara and David
*
We watched
L119 play with this harbor porpoise for about an hour
. She lifted it out of the water on many occasions, she swatted it with her pectoral fins, and she pushed it up into the air by balancing it on her rostrum too! It was a very entertaining experience! When we finally left the scene
she had finally caught up with her mom, L77, and she was still playing with her new toy
! -Bart Rulon

It was a Magical Day aboard the Mystic Sea with THREE kinds of whales! With reports of
members of L-pod (Southern Resident orcas) out by Hein Bank
, we headed out, spotting many seals on Colville Island en route. The first whale we found was
L-85 Mystery
(born 1991) with his 6' dorsal fin, a beautiful sight. Fairly close by we found a group of L-pod whales -
L-77, L-94 and calf L-121
, and several other members of their family. We had wonderful views as they interacted on the surface, in very calm sea conditions. Then we learned of Humpback whales - in the path of our homebound trip! We headed eastbound - and saw
three Minke whales
on the way to viewing
at least TEN Humpback whales
- WOW. A couple of these whales appeared to be quite friendly as they approached the boat - we were all in awe at the close looks and size of these whales. Along with harbor porpoise, turkey vultures, bald eagles and a newborn seal pup, it was truly a magical day! Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Small group of
Orcas just passed Point Roberts
heading south. Some breaching. At least two large males.
6 to 8 whales
travelling quickly and fairly close together.
Between
9:30 and
9:50 PM
. -Sandra Scott

Juan de Fuca ...near Race Rocks
this morning and our Local Southern Resident Killer Whales in the afternoon feeding around Sooke, B.C. Some Grey and & Fin Whales seen in the area...WOW THE SEA IS COMING ALIVE IN THE JUAN DE FUCA! Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW

L103 and her 8-month-old offspring L123 - and L86 - Sooke, BC
. -Paul Pudwell

On
July 15th at roughly
9am I saw two orcas a few hundred yards off Carmet beach in Sonoma County CA
. They were heading north, moving relatively slowly and sticking around a disturbance in the water, most likely some kind of feeding behavior as I saw sea birds in the area as well. It was a bit too far out to note any specific distinguishing features of individuals, but I thought I'd let you know as it is the first time I'd seen an orca in the area. -Skylar deWitte

Entry 2:
east Juan de Fuca...Then we learned of Humpback whales
- in the path of our homebound trip! We headed eastbound (from Hein Bank) - and saw three Minke whales on the way to viewing at least TEN Humpback whales - WOW. (north of Eastern Bank) A couple of these whales appeared to be quite friendly as they approached the boat - we were all in awe at the close looks and size of these whales....Jill Hein

Just one of the
many humpbacks near Eastern Bank
....this one has a crazy cool tail with rake marks, but check out the lower Jaw! -Janine Harles,

Entry 4:
Kingston Edmonds ferry had the pod crossing in the opposite direction
(heading towards Kingston) around
8pm
? -Shannon Mitchell

5:30 p.m. -
I think, we saw them today from
Bainbridge island ferry
! They are bigger than harbor porpoise, dark gray with lighter belly, with more prominent beak and dorsal fin. It was about
5:30 pm in the Elliott bay, very close to the ferry terminal. They were moving north. -Olya Dmitrieva
