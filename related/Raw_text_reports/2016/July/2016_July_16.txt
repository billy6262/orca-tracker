Saturday evening we (Island Adventures) were with
9-10 or more humpbacks southwest of San Juan Island
. The whales were mainly in pairs but also came together in pods of up to 5 animals. It has truly been spectacular out on the water. One of the large group of humpbacks that have been on the banks southwest of San Juan Island for the past few days. -James Gresham

This humpback was seen southwest of San Juan Island Saturday evening
. It has a severe parasite infestation which is indicative of poor health. It seemed to be behaving normally but this whale is not in good shape. -James Gresham
