Orca Sightings for July 4, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J2 Granny and her crew made their way back south past Lime Kiln
this evening
between
7:30 and
8:30
, spread out with
J2 and L87 trailing
, after a trip to the Fraser River. Fingers crossed that they found enough to eat to stick around for a while, and to call in the rest of J-Pod! I realized while watching her tonight that I've now known this whale more than half my life....pretty amazing. -Monika Wieland

After leaving the
Bigg's Transient killer whales near Kelp Reef (Encounter 65)
, Ken headed north to
Turn Point to meet with Granny's subgroup of J pod that was spreading out and foraging
in the very active swirls of incoming tide off the point. Presumably, an aggregation of salmon was riding in with the fast moving tide flow, but the sea surface was so turbulent that it was impossible to detect any predation events.
J19 and J41
were the west flanking whales and
J14, J37 and J49
were the east flanking whales while
J2 and L87 charged in a zig zag pattern down the middle
of the tide rips that shot up vertically like haystacks of water, dousing the boat and camera. The others (J40 and J45) were here and there in the swirls,... See photos and full report at CWR Encounter 66. -Center for Whale Research

July 4th from
Saturna Cottage
. Subgroup of
J pod
heading west. -James McLarnon

...As they passed
the reef in front of CWR
they were about 400 yards offshore when Ken snapped a photo from the porch. The male was
T51
! And the others with him were the
T36A's, the T75B's, and T49A2
. The same grouping, minus
T49A2
, were encountered last year on 24 May (2015 Encounter 36) as they travelled in a social group in front of the Lime Kiln lighthouse and moved slowly offshore zig-zagging along in relaxed transient fashion...See Photos and full report at CWR Encounter 65. -Center for Whale Research

I always love "meeting" a new Killer whale. This is
T51 born in 198
1 and more typically hangs out in Southeast Alaska. He was hanging with a few other groups of T's in north Haro strait on the 4th of July! -Traci Walter

7:25 p.m. - 3-4 orcas headed south toward Lime Kiln State Park
! -Maria Carney

6:35 p.m. - Group of transients heading out of Friday Harbor. 2-3 transients?
They went northbound along San Juan Island after. -Bri Wilson

Nice and close to home, we had our own 4th of July Parade with
Transient/Biggs killer whales off Lopez Island
today. As they traveled
by the Lopez ferry terminal and continued on around Shaw Island
, we had some excellent views of the three of them,
T123 (mom, born 1985), son T123A already a large male at only 16 years of age, and little sister T123C, born in 2012
. They passed by several nervous seals hauled out on nearby rocks, so were not in hunting mode, lucky for the seals! After great looks and local inter-island sight-seeing, we glimpsed these three again before heading back to port ..... finding a mom seal with her newborn pup, and bald eagles! What a great 4th of July, back in port in time for the festivities. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

T123s.
San Juan Clipper saw them take a seal in
Upright Channel and then head towards Friday Harbor
. -Stephanie Raymond
*

11:27 a.m. - East side of the Lopez spit
, we saw three orcas. I'm no expert but it looked like one big one (maybe adult male) and two smaller ones. Looked like they were moving northwest but also foraging (?) around. So beautiful! -Michelle Wormell Hollomon
*

11:00 a.m. -
WA State Ferries report from the ferry Elwha of
8 orcas at the west end of Thatcher Pass
. No direction of travel given.
*
Coastal killer whales -
Thayer Hollis a commercial albacore fisherman, called with
two orca reports from different days
July 4 &
June 28
) , both of solo males, but not the same animal. On
7/4 at noon, he was at N46 03 x 125 02, (about 40 miles west of Astoria) in 700 fathoms, when he saw a different male orca, also 4-500 yards away, heading ESE
.

July 4 Humpback Whales in Long Beach WA
- At least
2 humpbacks
were spotted off the beach just past the surf zone 2 miles north of the Ocean Park beach approach on the Long Beach Peninsula, WA. They were actively feeding near the surface and on multiple occasions the whales surfaced with most of their head out of the water and breached a few times. Sea birds were circling and diving into the water near the whales. Continued feeding for about an hour from
12:15 pm to
1:15 pm. -Garrett Knoll

Entry 2:
1:10 - Common dolphins heading north passing Boston Harbor Marin
a and toward the southern tip of Harstine Island. -Kim Merriman
