Orca Sightings for July 25, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:50 p.m. - Juan de Fuca - Ts are headed south into Admiralty
it looks like. It was rough out there! Five to six footers. I haven't looked up at a wave since Monterey Bay! I'd say more than fifteen. At least 20 and I wouldn't be surprised it it was pushing 25 individuals. Aiming that way definitely, they were zigging and zagging and was hard to keep track of all of them!
T65As
were in there. Pretty sure
T37s and T37As
. Plus many more. -Sara Hysong- Shimazu

WOW...what an AMAZING DAY! Capt. Dan on Sonar this morning was the first to find
Transient Killer Whales in the FOG just SW of Race Rocks!
We also visited
a few Humpbacks
. Then on our afternoon adventure we caught up to the same
Transients/Biggs (T065 & T037)
maybe others...with an acrobatic show of
12-20 Humpbacks
interacting or responding to the presence of
a dozen Orca
! Seas were rough but everyone had a BLAST! -Paul Pudwell
*

7:58 p.m. - Puget Sound - 2 humpback whales Camano side
of the passenger ferry lane traveling north
Mabana and State Park
at present. -Sally Olin
*
Juan de Fuca - A humpback riled up after the T065A's and T037's swim past on the afternoon of
July 25th south west of Race Rocks
. Notice the killer whale teeth rake marks on its pectoral fin from a previous encounter. -Mark Malleson
*

6:18 p.m. - 2 Grays, cow/calf pair, off South Beach, San Juan Island
now. They seemed to be heading away from shore when we left 20 minutes ago. Taking long dives. One surfacing every 3 to 5 minutes. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network
*

5:50 a.m. -
Tony Woelke, WS ferries reports
8 Harbor porpoise just out from the ferry dock at Kingston
.
*
A special visit of
two Gray Whales
- a rare thing, and especially out of the ordinary for the time of year. We met the pair
South of Iceberg Point
after exploring the remote cliffs, islands and hidden Bays
South of Lopez
. The Greys passed Whale Rocks and looked to be going through Cattle Pass, but turned and fought the flood current at the lighthouse to continue North on the San Juan shoreline. -Barbara & David, All Aboard Sailing
