Orca Sightings for July 6, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
A surprise to see these
9 precious Jpod whales (including L87) at the Fraser River two days in a row
. Their presence and behaviour would indicate they are being somewhat successful foraging here for right now. They have been spread out between the north and south arm of the river. We were fortunate enough to get good looks at the
J19 matriline a few times. J40 "Suttles" was with them and J51 "Nova"
has been full of beans apparently. J51 on his grandmother's back. J19 and J41 appeared to be rounding up a fish when this happened. Maybe J51 was a little to eager for a chunk of salmon from his patient grandma. -Tasli Shaw

I watched
4 Orca, 1 large male, 2 females (?), and I believe a young of the year, at the NE side of Miners Bay, Mayne Island at 0930
this morning. They were very active, surfacing a lot from shallow dives (the water is fairly shallow there), but all 4 were very active. Watched for 10 minutes; they played in the same area all the time. The male was distinctly large and I would describe his dorsal as shapely, in profile (smaller in the middle), if that helps. -Frank Gee, Parks Canada staffer

From transiting from our club outstation in
Gambier is. to WVYC we came across a small pod (two females and a male) on the north side of Bowen Is. between Hutt Is. to Hood Point.
That I can only think that they are Bigg's transient orca's. They have been lurking around the area since April. -"Orca Spirit"

2:59 p.m. - Humpback
(long down times and very little fluking) near
Possession, South of Point No Point
. -Janine Harles

Entry 2:
9:15 a.m. - Common Dolphins just headed north out of Eld Inlet.
It is so calm and quiet, I can hear every single surface. It's breathtaking this morning. Glassy water, and flying dolphins. -Kim Merriman
