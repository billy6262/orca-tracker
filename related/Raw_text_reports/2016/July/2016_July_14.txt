12:30 p.m. - Saw some orcas today near Lime Kilm on San Juan Island
. I was told it was the J pod over the radio I heard that possibly J27. I am new to this so if I am wrong about identification I am sorry. (ID's unconfirmed) -Kelli Carlson

...We saw our first group of
whales at 1002 heading north inshore of us between Eagle Point and False Bay
. This group included the
L55's along with L105 and J31
and they got by us with just a few proof of presence photos taken. We kept moving south in hopes of finding members of the
L12's (the L11's, L22's, L85, and L25-L87 is also a L12
but he was up north with the rest of J pod). We saw a male and a female inshore at Eagle Point and this turned out to be L22 and L89. These two milled briefly at the point before heading slowly south. Another boat reported that they had J27 a ways offshore of us. The J11's had not been with the rest of J pod when they had been inside the past week so it was interesting that they came in with the L's....

Absolutely beautiful, sunny, calm day on the Salish Sea! We had early reports of Southern Resident orcas "all over"....We slowed down to take a brief look at some chubby harbor seals and their pups, including one reddish one, which is unusual. We first caught up with the big male,
L41 Mega
, who is 39 years old, as he surfaced within great viewing distance. As all the whales were spread out, hunting for salmon, we saw brief glimpses of others, but enjoyed Mega's presence for a while. We then moved closer to San Juan Island,
around False Bay and Eagle Point
, to delight in the antics of
L121 Windsong
, who is now about 16 months old, with his mom
L94 Calypso
. Also seen with this group were the female
L22 Spirit
, who is estimated to be 45 years old, and the male,
Mystery, L85
, who is 25 years old. (final I.D.'s to be confirmed) With reports of
multiple humpbacks
out by the Romeo Alpha buoy, we motored out and had a wonderful encounter with
two of these majestic baleen whales
, who stuck very close together. We saw
at least 5 others
in the distance, and there were perhaps 15-20 to the west. We are so lucky to have these beautiful giants increasing their presence in Puget Sound. On the way home, two bald eagles were spotted and a harbor seal surround by gulls, enjoyed a fish feast. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
