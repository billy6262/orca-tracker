Orca Sightings for July 21, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J50 Scarlet and her mom J16 Slick
- just two of several whales seen from the ferry from
Salt Spring Island, B.C
. -Brett Forsythe
*
After missing the - I kid you not -
nine hours of west side whales in the morning and afternoon
, we made up for it by catching the
three hour evening extravaganza
, complete with sunset, lightning, rainbows, and some of the coolest clouds I've ever seen. And we LIVE here!! Around

9:15 p.m. the L12s did come up to meet Js
, and were very spread slowly southbound. I believe just
J Group B came back south? J17s, J11s, J22s
. There were practically whales in sight of Lime Kiln for all daylight hours today! -Monika Wieland
*

7:50 p.m. - SRKW on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. Echolocation and calls. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
1805-1815 - Seeing whales out front of County park. J28 and 54. Male offshore
. Not going very fast. A short time later they picked up the pace a bit still southbound. -Sara Hysong-shimazu
*
While out, we had L89, L22 and looked like L77 and L119, by False Bay
, southbound. We found a couple more at Pile Point southbound. A bit later the L94's southbound at Pile Point, but not really going anywhere. This was between approx.

5:25 and
5:50 p.m
. -Barbara Bender

WOW!!
J2 Granny, THE matriarch of an entire population, playing with a neonate harbor porpoise?!
J2 is possibly the oldest killer whale alive with an estimated birthday of 1911. She is a southern resident killer whale that feeds primarily on Chinook (king) salmon. J2 is the matriarch of the 83 southern resident killer whales that remain alive. Since this ecotype does not feed on mammals, this behavior is rare. It sure has scientists stumped ... Of course, it is also quite possible that this behavior happens more often than we know since we only see them a fraction of their day-to-day life. During the encounter,
J2 played with the porpoise
, pushing it around on her rostrum, back, side and would peridcially let it go to chase it down again. At the end of the encounter, she thrashed the baby harbor porpoise around a bit then left to join her adopted son, L87 Onxy who was waiting patiently about 300 yards away while she did her thing. Want to know the most interesting part?
The neonate porpoise actually survived
, for the time being at least. In other rare instances that have been observed where southern resident individuals "play" with harbor porpoise neonates, they actually play with them to death and usually drown. J2 knew just how much pressure to put on this neonate and deliberately did not kill it. This was indeed a rare behavior to witness. -Heather MacIntyre

The footage - Facebook Video - is of
Granny playing with a small porpoise 7/21/16 off Pender Island. Onyx was by her side
for about 15 minutes as she played a cat and mouse game with the dolphin. Eventually she came right along side us pushing the little porpoise along. About 10 minutes later she lost interest. The porpoise was seen twice afterwards swimming and surfacing. Granny and Onyx continued on their way north. We were on a whale watch tour with Salt Spring Island Adventure Co. Very unusual activity. -Joy McFate Lee

Another magnificent day on the Salish Sea! On the way north, we checked out some fat harbor seals, including the young reddish pup. Caught up with
two orcas, a male and female, just south of Eagle Point on San Juan Island
, and caught a few glimpses in between their very long dive times. With a report of orcas coming in from the west, we headed out and found
L94 Calypso, and her young son L121 Windsong
, with daughter
L113 Cousteau
following. As they sped toward San Juan Island, we were able to get great looks at this lovely family, including some with beautiful Mt. Baker in the background. As we left them to find other wildlife, they had formed up in a tight group, still heading very swiftly toward the other whales spread out all along Haro Straight, mostly heading north toward the Frasier Rive and hopefully a lot of salmon.
Out by Hein Bank we found 4-5 minke whales
, with a close encounter of the minke kind, to get a really good look at these beautiful small baleen whales. A splendid day! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

1:24 p.m. - Watched a few whales pass Land Bank northbound
. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

11:06 a.m. - Just saw J16s and J17s north of Lime Kiln
heading north. A male is approaching the park.
9:18 a.m. - J17s and J19s for sure traveled very slowly northbound from Lime Kiln and County Park. Lots of foraging and stalling out. J17s were doing above water vocals in front of the light. Those two groups were still going north when I left the park. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

11:30 a.m. - A few of the J17's passing Lime Kiln
on a morning pass (one of several today) just beyond the kelp patches. -Elizabeth Zwamborn
