Probably one of my most favorites of the season so far! This was taken during a pretty rowdy
"T-party" as we call them. 18 Bigg's Killer
whales in total came together for quite the parTy. Breaching, tail lobs, spyhops, cuddle puddles, you name it, we saw it. What I also love in the series I have of this image is that the little whale on the right just continues to do a headstand with the tail in the air for a little while. -Traci Walter

Entry 2:
7:00 p.m. - Dolphins moving very fast now south into Eld Inlet
. They are cruising and kicking up quite a wake as they go.

5:40 p.m. - they turned around and headed south into Budd Inlet. 8-9 surfacing at the same time
. Very impressive. And they're moving with a purpose.

2:30 p.m. - there is the other group of common dolphins currently heading north (slowly) just to the west of Zangle Cove (Budd Inlet)
. Very active! -Kim Merriman

Entry 3:
6:50 p.m. - Common dolphins still by Mukilteo!!
On the ferry headed to Clinton and Josh spotted them just south of the ferry lanes. East of mid channel. -Rachel Haight
*

6:30 p.m. - Common Dolphins still South of the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry, mid-channel
. -April Bosley
*

10:03 a.m. - A few minutes after departing Mukilteo, atop the deck on the
10:00 a.m. ferry Kittitas I spotted a lot of dorsals and knew instantly I was being blessed with the presence of one of the pods of common dolphins
that has been in Puget Sound the past month. The pod of
at least a dozen, including little ones
, was moving steadily westbound to the north of me in between the ferry lanes. They went on a dive and I could not relocate them at any time during the crossing to Clinton or once on land. Video below. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
