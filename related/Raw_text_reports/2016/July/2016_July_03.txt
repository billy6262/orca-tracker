Orca Sightings for July 3, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark and Hannah Malleson encountered
"J pod" in the morning inbound near Race Passage
in pretty rough water. The whales had been reported earlier off Otter Point as a 'big group' but
there were only J2, L87, and the J14's and J19's in a spread pattern
as they continued inbound. Ken was returning from Sequim by automobile/ferry so did not get out on the water in "Shachi" until 1620, and then it was only to photo-document J2 before fueling the boat to be ready if more residents come in.
Notes-Comments: The continuing pattern of only a few residents widely spread can be correlated with the Chinook salmon pattern of relatively few fish making it to the Fraser River Albion test fishery nets. This is another bad year for Chinook salmon in the SRKW core summer habitat!... See photos and full report at CWR Encounter 64. -Center for Whale Research

J2 Granny leading the J14's and J19's into Active Pass
this evening. Shortly after I shot this we (Island Adventures) ran a bit ahead of her and were going to sit and watch the J Pod whales stream pass when
suddenly the T100's/101's, T36A's, T75B's and T051 came out of the pass! The residents and T's were very nearly in the pass at the same time.
They gave each other a wide berth but the encounter ended with L87 who was off by himself headed directly towards one group of T's about 1/4 mile away before he veered into the pass. -James Gresham

2:59 p.m. - J2s in lead followed by J19s all porpoising, L87 trailing more than a mile back slower. L87 fishing offshore of Lime Kiln now. After 3 weeks away, some members of J-Pod finally returned to inland waters today! The 10 whales rocketed past Lime Kiln this afternoon, porpoising north on a flood tide. While it took them only a couple minutes to pass, it was great to see some friendly fins. That's J2 Granny on the right!

2:34 p.m. - They're nearing Land Bank, west side San Juan Island.

2:25 p.m. - They're crossing the Haro Strait fast

WOW! Great to hear an early report from Tory of Going Coastal Fishing Charters of
MANY Orca coming east from Muir Creek
. We had the pleasure of being the first to find some of
J Pod just off Otter Point
passing Sooke eastbound Juan de Fuca 14 minutes from our Dock! Great to sea some of our Southern Resident Killer Whales returning to our area! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW

5:22 p.m. - Common dolphins are heading north right now out of Eld Inlet
. They are cresting just under the chop.

5:15 p.m. - The common dolphins are still in the south Puget Sound
traveling back and forth between Budd Inlet (south) and Eld Inlet (north) and northerly toward Squaxin and Harstine islands. Very active at times; alternating that with feeding. Lots of onlookers. there are still about 15-20 here! -Kim Merriman

...there's another group (
common dolphins) we saw in our first trip off Kingston! Probably around 10-12 of them
. (in response to Kim's post on our Facebook page -ALB) -Renee Beitzel
