Orca Sightings for July 8, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:00 p.m. to
7:00 p.m. - Part of J pod had been in since
July 3rd (J2, L87, J14s and J19s)
. Morning time brought word of more incoming (or eastbound Juan de Fuca Strait) residents. This group turned out to be
the rest of J pod minus the J11s
. Both groups ended up
in Haro Strait off the west side of San Juan Island
, spread out quite a distance, and moving in all directions. Around

6:00 p.m. we caught up with what turned out to be the J16s (and possibly others) off False Bay
. Sweetly, the first whales we encountered were
J16 Slick and her 19 month-old daughter J50 Scarlett
who were first heading south then soon made directional change heading north, then south, then in circles. J16's family, daughters: J36 Alki and her son 17 month-old J52 Sonic; and 9 year-old
J42 Echo were foraging for Chinook salmon
.
J16s eldest offspring, 25-year-old son J26 Mike was to the north
and much further offshore. After spending time with the inshore whales we turned northwest to spend time with J26. No sooner had the boat gone idle did he veer towards us in a zig zag pattern. With engines now cut J26 headed right for us and dove under our bow where I stood. A meaningful moment to say the least. He continued on southbound, still zigzagging and well offshore. Soon after he veered inland all the while in foraging mode. We left the group still spread, with moms and calves inland and Mike still further off around
7:00 p.m. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

2:00 p.m. -
It's beginning to seem like summer...
Orcas cruised past again today!
Traveling east to west along the
south end of Lopez Island
, but they lingered a long time with many changes in direction.
About 10 orcas
, very spread out. And I saw two breaches! -Sally Reeve
*
We were lucky to catch up with
J-Pod (Group B) in Canadian waters yesterday, 4 of the new group of babies were there
...J-28 Polaris with her 7-month-old son J-54. We did the full distance today when hearing "incoming J-Pod members" near Race Rocks, west of Victoria BC! Fortunately the tides were in our favor, outbound and inbound, and what a thrill to find
J-Pod group B whale
s, who hadn't been seen in the Salish Sea for a while. Four of the newest babies were there - a real treat. As they slowly traveled east, we heard that
J-Pod group A whales were near our homeport of Anacortes!
So homeward bound, we picked up Group A by Cattle Point, on San Juan Island, heading north - traveling very close to shore.
L-87 Onyx
who travels with this group, was off-shore so we caught a good look at him. Wow, what a day, long but included with all these whales were seals, a Steller sea lion, bald eagles AND a Minke whale!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

J17's
(tho I didn't see J17 and others were saying J28's on radio),
J22's and J16's
were all inbound at Race Rocks this morning. They were fighting the current so only going like 3-4 knots! The kids all look great. We heard on radio later that
Jpod group A (granny and Onyx) were southbound at Bird Rocks
in Rosario. Hoping we will hear them tonight on LK! -Renee Beitzel
*
"Another BC Moment." Part of
J pod east bound past Beechey Head

7:55 a.m. - Many ORCA (inbound or east) off Sooke
right now! -Paul Pudwell

6:00 p.m. - Single Humpback

*
[pause point during a run at Ft. Ebey SP, about

3:30 p.m.
, Friday, 08 Jul 16 from
Partridge Point
looking out and to the right of the big green buoy that goes "ding"] Whale spout! Big splash! Flukes? It was close enough in to see the flukes and decide it was
most likely a humpback
; far enough out to wish it would turn toward us. After the third misty puff of air and, perhaps, a smallish breach, all went quiet. -John Morelock
*

Minke whale
, quick glimpses of this guy only.
South end of Lopez
, heading to Colville Island. -Jill Hein
