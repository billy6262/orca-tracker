Orca Sightings for July 7, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's been awesome having J-Pod around for a week straight, the kind of thing we expect this time of year, but had not experienced in May and June!
On
July 7th, the J2s (J2, L87, and the J14s) and J19s headed north past Lime Kiln around 3 PM
. We left them heading north off Turn Point at 6 PM.
On
July 8th, the J2s and J19s started passing Lime Kiln going north around 4 PM
. The rest of J-Pod (minus the J11s) was inbound, however, and just as we saw the whale-watching boats rounding Discovery Island, the J2s and J19s veered out and went to meet them. All the whales met up in the middle of the straights and headed back towards San Juan, "hitting" the island around False Bay. At
6:30 PM some whales started going north again past Lime Kiln, including the J2s, J19s, and J17s. Whales were in sight to the north and south not really going anywhere around
7:45 PM. From our boat, we met up with the northern whales at about

8:30 off Stuart Island, where they were very spread out and still going north
, making beautiful vocalizations in the quiet evening.
At some point during the night, the J22s and J16s must have gone north, because
at 11 AM on
July 9th, all present J-Pod matrilines headed south past Lime Kiln
, spread out and well offshore.
At
3:30 PM, however, as they made their way back north past Lime Kiln, they gave us shore-based whale watchers the passby we've been waiting for this season, with lots of surface activity and playing in the kelp. They were all still slowly. northbound at 4 PM

Caught up with members of
J pod off Henry Island split in 3 groups. L87 on the outside, a group of 6 in the middle and 2 much closer land
. Steady northbound with a pause in the rip for a few breaches & tail lobs, and possibly chasing a salmon. Steady progression north mostly with occasional bursts of activity. Out from Spieden Island a succession of tail lobs by several in the pod, and they all kept their course. Just south of Stuart Island we headed east towards inshore whales, one of who engaged in multiple breaches. We left with them still steadily northbound SW of Stuart Island just after
5:00 p.m.
Yep,
those 10 whales! J19s, J14, and J45 were middle group inside of Onyx. J37 was breacher near J49. J2 was in their vicinity and J40 was way inshore by herself.
Thanks to Monika Wieland for help with ID's and who was where. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

...On
July 7th, the Odyssey was able to see the
Js and Onyx L8
7 again. They had come
back down from the Fraser River via Rosario Strait and were coming back up the west side of San Juan Island.
We arrived on scene with them as they neared Lime Kiln State Park. The ten of them were very spread out but we ended up seeing
Granny J2, Hy'shqa J37, Ti'lem I'nges J49, and Onyx L87. Onyx L87 stayed offshore while the other three were inshore.
Granny J2 was in the lead and when we reached Open Bay, she surfaced with a piece of salmon in her mouth. We left them at Open Bay as they continued on their journey, perhaps back to the Fraser River... See Melisa's photos and full reports at San Juan Orcas Blog. -Melisa Pinnow

3:28 p.m. - Large group of residents heading north past Lime Kiln
. Ken and research boats following. -Bri Wilson
*
The subgroup of
J Pod comprised of J2 et. al. was found mid-day near the south end of Lopez Island
as they were
coming back toward Haro Strait along the coastline of Lopez
. Ken launched in "Shachi" to encounter the
very spread out group
as the whales came toward False Bay, San Juan Island following their typical foraging pattern. The encounter began at
1433just off Pile Point
with the whales very spread out moving northwest against the ebbing tide just as it was turning to flood. The whale-watching boats were very disciplined and staying in a line about one half mile offshore of San Juan Island as the whales swam along conducting very long and unpredictable dives in the corridor between the shore and the vessel-based observers. L87 was the offshore flanking whale, and he zigged and zagged a half mile or so between surfacings with very unpredictable intervals on either side of the line of boats...

Have not seen many of these this season. About a dozen vessels traveling slowly from east to west with one large specimen (Clipper) joining the pod from the west. Pod generally stayed close together with a sailboat tour hugging the shore and a few others meandering in search of great photo opportunities. Did notice several humans leaning over railings but no spy hops or breaches or slashing. There may have been feeding activity on the larger vessels. This activity was viewed by
about a dozen orcas as they cruised past heading to the west
in two tightly packed groups and one solo male. The orcas had an enjoyable time, glad they decided to visit
Iceberg Point, Lopez Island
and hope they do this tour several more times this summer. -Sally Reeve
