Orca Sightings for March 9, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:50 p.m. - Large humpback (or gray) sighted approx 200 yds off Camano shore near Indian Beach
. (when I saw it from my window so close and large I actually gasped, and my first thought was "that's a humpback" due to the hump as it dove. I then heard it surface (it was behind a tree from my view) and saw it surface one more time. It was also alone, making me think humpback. But in retrospect I can't swear I saw a dorsal fin so I may be wrong.) -Ruth Westra
