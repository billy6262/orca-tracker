Orca Sightings for March 24, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J54 is confirmed male.
Five of the eight remaining calves from the SRKW "baby boom" are male. This sex ratio does not bode well for growth. -Center for Whale Research

What a great end to spring break. Spent some time with the
J17s and J22s up in Trincomali Channel and then with the rest of J pod at sunset in San Juan Channel
. -Melisa Pinnow

J54 SEX CONFIRMED AS MALE.
- I couldn't believe how lucky we were with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching. Together, Captain Andy and I made a great team to find J Pod traveling slowly north in Swanson's Channel! Because of Andy's hawk eyes, I was finally able to spend some quality time with
J54 and his mother, J28 Polaris
. During that time, J28 Polaris lifted him up on her rostrum in a playful display of affection, and I was able to get a clear photo of his abdomen confirming his sex. I can't take all of the credit though! Researchers already knew that he was male from previous photographs, but I was able to provide them with a clear shot that they could share. Luckily, I was in the right spot at the right time and had my camera ready. I love it when teamwork works out! -Heather MacIntyre

Whale sighting. Lots of spouting and tiny whale tale. Then saw the whale again spout appx 15 minutes later, headed South towards Downtown Edmonds. Moving Slow.
First spotted at
5:21pm.
Didn't make it more than a mile traveling in half hour. Baby humpback?! I recognized the humpback back at one point.. maybe the adult.. and then this video though is such a tiny tail. It was a side view of course and my phone camera was zoomed in, so a bit far away. But close enough to shore to catch a glimpse at least. I see a tiny spray first in the video! Much smaller than the other sprays we also saw! You can count on it here first...Oh yeah. Baby whale! -AnaLisa Gerbig
