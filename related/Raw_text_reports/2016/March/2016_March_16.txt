============================================================

Entry 1:
6:50 p.m. - Hidden beach
halfway across the passage. Maybe a baby? About
5 of them
. -Penstemon E. Gayfeather

Finally found
T046's today, 4 very elusive orca as they left Penn Cove, around
3:50 this afternoon
. They started to head northbound from Penn Cove, but then appeared to turn southward ..... haven't seen them since.
Long long down-times, 20 minutes plus
.... easy to lose them. Am watching Saratoga now, will let you know if they're spotted again. -Jill Hein
