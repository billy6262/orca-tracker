============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a Good Friday!
J Pod, including Eclipse J41 and her son Nova J51, came to visit us in Sooke, B.C. this morning
...we had a great day following a spread out Pod from Race Rocks to Sooke. -Paul Pudwell, Sooke, BC
*
Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage
They were incredible! Especially from Fox Spit, we were so lucky as they would dive down for long periods of time but decided to come up right out in front of Fox Spit, this side of mid channel, closer to Whidbey. First saw them at Bells Beach and then left them at the end of Baby Island dock while they headed north, but were coming towards BI. A lot of Sea Lions in 3 separate bunches barking up a storm, like crazy! The pod flipped, turning southbound in the early evening. -Marilyn Armbruster
T
his pod has been ID'd as the T46C's and probably the T46B's, by Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale for Whale Research.

9 Bigg's killer whales, members of the T46Bs & T46Cs traveling northbound up the east side of Whidbey Island through Saratoga Passage between Clinton Ferry and Langley
. What a great day to be out on North Puget Sound and have the bonus privilege of observing Orcas where they belong: In the wild and free! In a "Whale-Wise" way - I watched the Pod as they slowly hunted and frolicked north into Saratoga Passage.

Hood Canal

11:00 a.m. -
Follow up report from yesterday. Saw two today;
two blows, two fins, one smaller, heading south down Hood Canal closer to the east shore just north of Lilliwaup
. Seemed too few for Orcas. I hope someone else saw these and can ID them...Dorsals look like Orca, their bodies are dark as they come up out of the water. They traveled like Orcas too. Height of the blows have to guess at several feet. I was seeing them across the wide part of the canal without my binoculars. Saw them yesterday at
5:30pm near Hoodsport too. (see Nick's report below and Jeni's
March 24 report) -Jeni Gray
*

9:30-
10:00 a.m. - We had a pod of orcas cruise by us about half way down the hood canal
today. Was very cool. We were fishing a beach on the west side of the canal when we saw them cruising south near the Eastern shore. They were definitely orcas and from what I could see there
appeared to be three of them
but I'm not 100% on that. They were cruising south around 930-10 am, and about an hour and a half later we saw them cruise back along the same side heading north. Would have been not too far north of Dewatto. -Nick Clayton
*
San Juans
Saw these whales while on the ferry right after
leaving Lopez Island going towards Anacortes!
around

9:30 am
. (Unable to share FB video which shows several blows and WSF can be heard announcing
pod of 4-5 orcas
on starboard side - ALB) -Ashlee Gaetz
*
A quick update: A very successful day on the water for this area. We
IDed 6 whales (21, 49, 56, 383, 531, 723) with that being the first day 21 has been seen this season
. We obtained
two biopsies, of 383 (not sexed yet) and 531 (known female due to calve and which we can use to test for pregnancy)
.
Three deployments of vide tags (49, 383, and 723)
with two still on into the night. This is way more than I hoped for out of one day on the water. We are headed back out this morning to do another survey and to look to do tag recoveries (if they are off) but likely not deploy any more tags. We will be looking for an opportunity to biopsy 56 who has not been sampled or sexed yet and would complete our sex determinations on the most regular whales. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research Collective

7:00 p.m. - from Grand Ave Park in Everett, we watched 2 possibly 3 gray whales
this evening west of the marina that's across from Jetty Island. They were spread out. Watched them come from between Hat Island and Camano ENE towards the estuary and Jetty Island. -Shelby Hight Fifield

2:55 -
3:30 p.m.
From beach east of Mukilteo ferry I watched what appeared to be
at least two gray whales blowing and sounding, south and east of Hat/Gedney Island
w/Cadscadia Research on scene. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

9:36 a.m. - Grey whale just south of the clinton ferry dock
heading north. Very close to the Whidbey side. -Danielle Pennington

...Also encountered
a humpback whale feeding at the entrance to Holmes Harbor
in one of the herring spawning areas (good ID and sample). -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research
