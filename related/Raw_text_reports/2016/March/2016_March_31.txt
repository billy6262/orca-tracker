We had a magical encounter with

J28's...(photo of Polaris J28 and her son J54, and Star J46, her little brother J54 & their mom Polaris J28)
. Every whale is special, but the longer you are out here and spend time with these orcas, there are certain individuals you end up gravitating towards for a multitude of reasons. J28, Polaris, is one of those whales to me. When I first starting seeing wild Killer whales in the San Juans, I almost always saw her. It likely had something to do with how identifiable she was with her nick in the dorsal fin, but nearly every encounter, there she was. So she quickly became a whale I loved now for almost 10 years. It's been a great pleasure and joy to watch her go from a little teenage rascal to a very caring and responsible adult with now 2 kids. So this encounter, while would have been special no matter which whale, was elevated for me because it was Polaris. We got to see special family bonding time, rolling, cuddling, and just being together.... -Traci Walter
