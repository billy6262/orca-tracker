Orca Sightings for March 18, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a beautifully calm sunny day we left Langley and very quickly spotted the spout of our
first gray whale. It was #531, just south of Camano Head
. Then more spouts to the south - so off in that direction where we eventually found
two whales traveling together, #56 and #723
. They were feeding along the shallow bank just
south of Hat (Gedney) Island.
Such a good feeding area for these whales in approximately 25 feet of water. Homeward bound we found something you don't see too often - a bald eagle landed on tree trunk debris in the middle of Saratoga Passage .. we caught him taking off to catch his lunch. A fun day on Mystic Sea, as usual. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea
