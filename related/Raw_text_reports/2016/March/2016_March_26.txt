Orca Sightings for March 26, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:20 p.m. - a large pod of Orcas briskly exited Hood Canal
. We last saw them between the entrance of Port Ludlow and Foulweather Bluff heading northward. There were
at least a half dozen
. Also, nearly a steady stream of hundreds of Porpoises, were observed for hours late afternoon and evening along the Hood Canal side of Foulweather bluff.
All were swimming northward
. -Douglas Paeth
*

4:43p.m. - Looking across Hood Canal south of bridge/Lofall area at what appears to be a pod of Orcas
. Anyone have insight? Trying to get photos but we are on the opposite side of canal. They seem to be stationary right now and hunting. Lots of breaching. Will let you know if we get a sense of direction. At least 3. -Leslie Boyd
*
Spent the afternoon with the
T137s. Caught up with them just south of San Juan Island and kept pace with them as they traveled past Friday Harbor and up into San Juan Channel
. Just south of Yellow Island they hit pay dirt and purposefully dispatched of a harbor seal. Lots of pecs and fins and a big spyhop for good measure. We left them as they continued north. Epic encounter! -Debbie Stewart
*

6:30 p.m. -
We left the whales about 25 mins ago. They milled around
Yellow/Low Island and looked to have made a kill
. They are now working their way north. They may head over to San Juan before the night is done!

4:51 p.m. -
Watching them now on our skiff. They are .
passing FH
but along Shaw Island coastline

4:04 p.m. - Orcas going up San Juan Channel
, believed to be
T137's

We heard from Western Prince that they found the
T137s this afternoon south of Lopez Island
.

Admiralty Inlet - T046B's and T046C's exiting Admiralty Inlet
in the afternoon. -Mark Malleson

! About 5 of them cruising along the shore, headed north! With a huge bald eagle sitting pretty taboot! -Emika Wnag
*

11:35 a.m. -
Bart Rulon from Island Adventures just called in a report as well. He just left the the
T46Bs and Cs north of Double Bluff
, grouped up heading north at a good pace, angling towards Marrowstone?
*

11:26 a.m. -
Puget Sound Express with the
Transient T46 (Cs & Bs)
Orca's northbound off
Double Bluff

. 120' of water. -Jeff Dodd

4:42 p.m. -
Wanted to report that we just saw
1 (?) small gray whale 100 yards off shore at Boston Harbor (just north of Olympia)
. Didn't get a good look but was definitely a whale and we saw it breach 3 times! -Linnea Madison
*

1:15 p.m. - Two calls from WA State Ferries, both the Salish and Hyak Ferries reporting a Gray or maybe Minke whale between Orcas and Shaw Islands, just below the surface, possibly heading east
.
*
...Three deployments of suction-cup attached video tags (on
49, 383, and 723
) with two still on into the night. Both tags were on until early this morning (did not hear them at 0500 but were off at 0600 so sometime between then) and recovered them later that morning, both appeared in good working order and recording but will not know for sure if the data is good for a day or two).
Documented feeding in the shallows of the Snohomish
by two whales at high tide both this morning and evening, two others feeding shallow
just south of Tulalip Bay
, and tonight
three feeding off W Camano near Mobana
. Collected one fecal sample from one of the animals we tagged yesterday (49) and also got a skin sample of one more of our unsexed animals (56 which leaves only one left we have not sampled and not yet seen this year). -John Calambokdis, Cascadia Research Collective
*

6:30 p.m. - Spotted two gray whales heading north from Bells Beach
pier. -Alan Cohen
*

6:00 p.m. - Two gray whales in Saratoga Passage
this evening! Traveling and feeding. First off Camano then crossed over to Whidbey heading North, turned and headed South and then back over towards Camano. -Ron McCabe
*
Gray whale #723
with Mt. Baker providing the backdrop, near Hat/Gedney Island. I was out with Island Adventures and we saw
all 6 of the Saratoga Grays confirmed in the area. 723 was swimming with 531
. Saratoga Grays 723 and 531 were being quite cozy with each other this afternoon. Logging on the surface together, cuddling and repeatedly lifting their rostrums out of the water. We even saw them swimming backwards. In my yrs on the water I have never seen anything other than an orca swim backwards. -James Gresham .
*

12:50 p.m. -
Eric and Jill from Mystic Sea report
gray whales #49, Patch, #531 & #723 on East side of Gedney Island, #21 & #383 on West side of Gedney Island
. They are headed to Baby Island to check out possible Humpback Sighting!
*
There are
3 Gray's
out there and another one a little further North. -Janine Harles
*
It was a chilly evening with gray skies when we encountered the
transient killer whale family T137s
. They zig-zagged across
San Juan Channel
, traveling from seal haul out to seal haul out and spent at least 20 minutes predating on one seal. We left the pod of four traveling north through
President's Channel, Orcas Island
. -Kevin Culmback, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris

The T137s around the San Juan Islands
. -Traci Walter

Spent the afternoon with the
T137s

2:30 p.m. -
Whale Sighting. In 60 years I have never seen
a whale in the lower end of Hood Canal
. 1 whale traveling. (
reported as Pilot whale but all
probability is orca
. See
1:30 report below, and our
March 27th includes reports of orcas on the 26th. - ALB
)
*

1:30 p.m. - Orca Sighting
, The one I saw as not real big. At the time I was thinking a smaller female. We were approximately
a mile north of Belfair State Park on Hood Canal
. The weather was perfectly clear and I had a totally unobstructed view of Hood Canal. All of a sudden I saw a whale blow and an Orca surface, then go back down. It had a large dorsal that was sagging over and I could see the black back. It didn't come out of the water enough to see any white on it, but I know it was an Orca. (Years ago I spent 10 years commercial fishing in Washington and Alaska and have encountered many whales and marine mammals). I alerted the other people who were there and we began watching for it to surface again. About 10 minutes later we saw it surface and spout a few hundred yards down the beach. That was our last sighting. I am familiar with the waters it was in and it was traveling northward along a shelf that is about 30 ft deep. It was like it was feeding on something, but I have now idea what as it is not salmon season. I know Orcas travel in pods and there certainly could have been more off the beach that we were just not seeing. -Michael Birkland
