Orca Sightings for March 20, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:10 p.m. - J Pod on Lime Kiln
. -Connie Bickerton
*
Today we had our
first on-the-water encounter with J pod
this year! It was a bit of a dreary Northwest day, but that certainly didn't dampen the excitement. The entire pod was traveling slowly in tight groups near Discovery Island. Lots of social behavior and lots of antics from the new babies! Icing on the proverbial cake! -Katie Jones
*
Just an incredible encounter with
Jpod off Discovery Island
. Very tight groups with a lot of surface time, some seasnakes, and lots of baby play. There is something so magical and powerful to see these incredible families and their strong bonds together, like
15-month-old J50 Scarlet and her mom J16 Slick, J17 Princess Angeline and her 5-month-old offspring J53, and J34 Doublestuf aside a belly-flopping nearly 4-month-old J54
. As I watched this scene take place, I think to the future. Will they have enough food to eat? What will the year ahead bring these Endangered animals. We still need to talk about Salmon and dam removal! Please remember to call the White house and urge President Obama to remove the lower 4 Snake River Dams. We also got to observe Ken Balcomb from the Center for Whale Research. He's been studying these whales for 40 years! -Traci Walter

J Pod today on the West Side of San Juan Island

Nice to see
gray whale #383 has returned to Saratoga Passage
. He was seen today
feeding with #56, just south of Hat Island. Whales #531 and #49 Patch were near the entrance to Port Susan too
. Great to see Patch back in our waters, he's been recorded being here locally every year since 1991 (Cascadia Research Collective records). -Jill Hein
*
S
aw #383 today! About noon, between Everett and Hat Island
, we were with #383 and then as we were leaving we saw another one in the distance near Hat Island. Out with Chilkat. Mystic Sea and Redhead had just joined us so they probably got an ID on the other one. -Janine Harles
*
Some sort of
large whale at West Beach, Whidbey Island at
8:30
this morning, fairly close to shore, trending south, saw several blows and its back but no fluke or easily identifiable parts. (unconfirmed, but sounds like gray - ALB ) -Teri Bozeman
*

11:00 a.m. - Juvenile humpack off Brownsville
. Friend and I were leaving Brownsville Marina this morning when a juvenile humpback surfaced directly ahead of our vessel. Was alone.
Headed towards Agate Pass
the last we saw. (Brownsville is on Kitsap Peninsula across from Bainbridge Island). -KC Crowell
*
Received a report today from Dan, reporting a sighting of
3 - 5 orcas
March 20th at noon, close in off Bella Beach, north of Fogerty Creek (and State Park) Oregon
. No direction of travel given. Approx. lat/long 44.861863, -124.048618

Around

15:30 we spotted a gray whale
. We were in
Fay Bainbridge park in Bainbridge Island
. So exciting! It's the first time we spot a wild whale. I believe it was going north east...I am not sure whether it was a gray whale or a humpback. It might have been the same humpback someone else spotted earlier! We only saw it for a few second when it came out for air and then its tail came out all the way and it was gone. It was kinda far from us, we were looking through binoculars.
