Orca Sightings for March 19, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
3:19 p.m. - Patch is southbound along the west side of Gedney
. We watched him swim right into the middle of a bunch of kayakers. A group of kayakers at the northern end of Gedney Island got quite a surprise Saturday afternoon when
Saratoga Gray #49 Patch
who had been seen further offshore suddenly surfaced in the middle of the group and decided to hang around while foraging on the bottom. The group did a very nice job of calmly backing up and giving him room. Saratoga Passage
Gray Whale #531

We believe we saw a
mama grey whale and her calf
(can't rule out mom/calf, but we haven't heard anyone else report that) We were
east of Camano Island near Camano Head
. They were close to the shoreline as you can see by the houses in the background and we assume feeding there. We watched them as they stayed in that area for over an hour. Couldn't really say they were traveling they appeared to be busy feeding and circling around, mostly close to the beach....The second one was smaller and sometimes snuggled up close to the first one but was usually traveling fairly close behind. We could see that the tail fin was much smaller, the length of time you saw the back was much shorter and the blow smaller too. -Erica Rayner-Horn
