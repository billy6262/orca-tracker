Orca Sightings for March 15, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today I went on my usual whale scouting routine and just as I was driving up to
the mouth of Penn Cove, I saw orcas heading in! They made a kill off Monroe Landing
and stayed there for almost an hour before heading back out. They made it just south of Fox Spit before turning back north. Such a beautiful day spent with whales!
ID'd as the T46s

T46's in Penn Cove

Captain Carl Williams and Naturalist Tyson Reed on the Island Explorer 4 did
ID a new gray for the 2016 season. Photo confirmed shows that #383
has returned. "Just as we reached
the end of Gedney island
Captain carl spotted a blow, and then another blow, it was two more gray whales. We got in nice and close to them and found out it was #56 and #383 swimming side by side..." -Jess Plier, IA
