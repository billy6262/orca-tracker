Orca Sightings for March 28, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:25 p.m. - 4 Orcas (looks like T137 and family) just passing Harrington Lagoon, Whidbey side
, looks like they're heading to Penn Cove! -Jill Hein
*

7:13 p.m. - 4 orca whales (one was little) heading north in Saratoga passage toward Penn Cove
/Oak Harbor, moving pretty quick. -Fran Farley Kendall
*

4:00 p.m. - at least 2 Camano side
of mid channel passing Mabana. Then
4:15 male passed Mabana much closer to Camano.

3:50 p.m. - T137A from Mabana on Camano
, seeing blows and dorsals powering through the chop, heading north mid-channel sightline between Mabana and Langley. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
Dick Snowberger called at about

3:30, watching from Boy & Dog Park on First St, Langley, seeing one or two Gray whales feeding south of Camano Head
, and also saw the four Transient orcas pass by them heading north up Saratoga Passage, off south Camano Island.
*

3:17 p.m. - T137's within 200 yards of two grays
.
(Below is the description of what ensued)
Major altercation between the 137's and #56 and 531.
137a drove into them from the south and mom drove in from the North. Both grays rolled over maybe a dozen times, pecs flying. T137 and 137a trashed about around them for about 5 minutes and then moved on. 56 and 531 are now in the shallows of Camano Head and look no worse for wear. Pretty wild!....When we watched that incident with Patch several years ago it was pretty brief, the 8 or so kw passed under him and he spun around, showed his belly to the surface and probably gave a bubble blast to ward them off. As Tyson and myself recall today, it seemed like 137a (14 year old) kind of went in on his own, and mom bolted in after him. The grays were not having it, and all three calves quickly bolted away after the scuffle, mom following behind them after they were clear. Tough to say, but it seemed like 137a was just being a punk and picking a fight he shouldn't have.

3:10 p.m. - T137's!

2:50 p.m. -
Got them. N side of Gedney moving to Saratoga. -Michael Colahan

2:15 p.m. - Group of 3 Orcas sighted just north of Clinton Ferry Dock

2:15 p.m. -
Sandra Pollard just called to report seeing
4 Transient orcas from the ferry at the Mukilteo ferry landing
. She sees one male, two females and one juvenile, heading north toward Gedney/Hat Island. And added: "We were returning to Clinton on the
2:00 pm ferry, and almost at the ferry dock. The ferry captain announced that there were 'porpoises off the beach, port side.' I went outside and saw a fast disappearing dorsal fin on the port side, then saw three dorsal fins pop up on the starboard side heading towards Gedney (Hat) Island, seemingly on a mission. Two shorter dorsal fins and one smaller dorsal fin, then husband Dick spotted a big dorsal fin coming up behind."
*
Today at
630pm we spotted a pod of 5 (we think) orcas in Campbell river.
Between the light house and red bell bouy. There was 2-3 very small orcas. They were travelling south. -Micah Anderson
*
A gray hung out just South of Titlow Beach
with Tacoma Narrows Bridge at sunset tonight and was feeding along the Northern tip of Day Island. He seemed to be so black and so big but not like an orca. And he seemed to be alone unless there was a baby. I kept seeing a little fin. (pec fin while on side feeding). -Karen Caldwell

While sitting on the ferry, two blows were spotted about .5 miles east of the Clinton Ferry terminal. The was a whale watching boat nearby. No fins noted, just blows. At least two whales were present. They looked like grey whales from what little I could see. Scott Shea
