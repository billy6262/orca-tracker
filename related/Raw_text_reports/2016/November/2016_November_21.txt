Swam south toward Beverly Beach and then crossed to the west side of the harbor and continued south all the way to Freeland. They then turned north and swam back up the east side of the harbor....swam rapidly until they were south of Beverly Beach...They stopped and appeared to be feeding just south of Beverly Beach for about 30 minutes.
