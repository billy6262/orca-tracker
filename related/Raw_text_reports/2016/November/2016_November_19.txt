Orca Sightings for November 19, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:47 a.m. - Two whales mid channel between Seattle and Bainbridge Island heading north
. I would say they are orcas because of how fast they are moving and blowing. Living a life dream because I can report a sighting to Orca Network. -Mary Freiburger

Spent some time with
Humpbacks in Swanson Channel near Prevost Island
. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Dall's porpoise bow riding in Boundary Pass
