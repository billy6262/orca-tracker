now.
Approx.
10:00 a.m. - From Owen Beach Large Humpback? Headed south past Point Defiance
(Tacoma area) on the near near side... Moving fast. Heavy fog is obscuring viewing from point South to Titlow and beyond. -Ryan Spence

2:30 p.m. - Feeding Humpback Sighting.
S/he was a
bout half way between the south end of Vashon island and the North tip of Point Defiance park
. Surfacing for air for 4 or 5 times, then diving for 4 or 5 minutes at a time, and resurfacing a couple hundred yards out from where last seen. I watched this pattern of behavior for about 90 minutes via kayak. I was viewing the whale at a distance of 100 to 300 yards for this period. At one point early on, the whale seemed to be curious about my actions and came very near the surface, after a long dive, just 20 ft in front of me. I was quite startled and quite elated! It did not appear to break the surface, but stirred up the water in front of me enough to set my kayak a-rocking! -Vince Walzem

(
Unconfirmed gray.
There was a gray included in our last report (
October 30th) during the time this whale has been moving back and forth in same vicinity. - ALB)

10:24 a.m. -
Hi there, we're at the Cliffside RV park on
Whidbey Island NAS, near Rocky Point
. There's been a whale, possibly 2, in the waters since last evening. Has it been reported or checked on? I find it strange to be hanging around vs traveling. I have not seen a dorsal fin nor fluke. It seems to be on the smaller side too. Just checking in. Thanks for your time and efforts! -Gretchen Shephard

Entry 2:
3:52 p.m. -
Last Thursday, 27 Oct 16, I noticed there was a
single gray or humpback whale
outside of where I work. He/she has been to the
East of Smith Island
cruising up and down along
NAS Whidbey Island
. We have seen it every day for the last eight days and he hasn't traveled more than two to five miles up and down the coast. It seems unusual that it hasn't moved on and it's not in a pod. I have worked here for two years and usually the whales just pass through if we see them at all. At first it was great to see it, but now we are worried. The crab pots were here, and we don't want him to be tangled. Our address at work is 3675 W Lexington St, Oak Harbor WA 98278. Our Latitude 48.3434 Ã‚ and Longitude -122.6814 is for my work. My guess is, it is between 200 and 400 yards off base. If someone could check it out, that would be great. -Sandy Mattingly
