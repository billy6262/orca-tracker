Entry 1:

Late last night (24th) the Surf was rough and it was very windy but I'm sure

Orca sighting 11/24/16 at
3:30 Discovery Bay.
To the best of our limited knowledge there were
5 Orcas (Large adult with baby, another adult and two juvenile sized whales)
that appeared to be eating in Discovery Bay. There were many Sea Gulls while they circled and ate. We watched from our condo at Worldmark Discovery Bay (Orcas Dr, Port Townsend). After eating there were multiple breaches by the juveniles celebrating there feast. They then slowly made their way to the north toward the sound. -Tom Miller

3:30 (Thanksgiving) - Unidentified baleen whales - I saw a single whale blow in north Budd/Eld inlets heading toward Squaxin Island
. It was pouring rain and getting dark so I never saw another blow. Tall blow. Drifted north as the wind was blowing from the south. Did not see a 'dorsal' as in orca. -Kim Merriman
