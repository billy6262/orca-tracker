"The male looks like T49A1", Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
)
*
South Puget Sound - I watched them for about an hour in
Case Inlet south of Herron Island, between
3:30 &
4:30pm
, trending south. Not in a hurry, diving for 1-2 minutes at a time, with some changes in direction. There were
at least 4 of them
: one male and 3 likely females or juveniles. Unfortunately, they were being shadowed by a jet ski, who was much too close. Will post some (distant) pictures later. -Dave Berliner
