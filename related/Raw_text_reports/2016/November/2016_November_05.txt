Humpback! Pt Defiance in Tacoma, Owen Beach. At 1100 it was out by Maury Island
and disappeared into the fog. It reappeared 100-300 yards off shore at
11:15, swimming toward Dalco slowly. We walked along as it swam leisurely toward Dalco until the west end of Owen Beach around
11:40. It mostly stayed shallow with a couple of deep dives along the way. Video to be added later. -Lissa Brod Anderson

10:30 a.m. -
Over 30 lob-tailing flaps seen from probable gray whale (other reports/photos confirm
humpback) in Dalco Passage
this morning between
10:30 and
11:00 AM. Many sprays, a few breaches....Moved back and forth in front of Point Defiance ferry terminal. Seen from Tahlequah. -Janice Stixrud
*

11:15 AM - Unidentified cetaceans - Dash Point (north of Commencement Bay, Tacoma)
- Small pod of what appeared to be Orca. Rounding Dash Point close to shore, heading south - definitely too large for porpoises. No large male dorsal fins observed. Unknown numbers, maybe 5 or 6. (this pod was never re-sighted and we had no other reports of orcas.
Possible this was a small pod of the common dolphins
who have stayed over from June, or another group. See Dolphins section above of
November 7th dolphin sighting- ALB). -Eric Elgar
