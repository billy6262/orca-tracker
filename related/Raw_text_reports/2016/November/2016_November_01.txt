I observed the whale from on the water this morning moving north and south (back and forth) in the center area of the Dalco/ Narrows/ Colvos Passages (the area between
Point Defiance, Gig Harbor and Vashon Island)
. Slow surface rolls and breathing followed by dives. Same patterns I've seen the last several days. Was paddling and did not manage to get any good fluke shots. But a good size and healthy looking whale. -Dean Burke

Dalco spot
