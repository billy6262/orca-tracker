Orca Sightings for November 25, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
...At 1218, with 'Big Eyes' I saw
distant whales in mid-Haro Strait heading south
very spread out and taking long dives. They acted like Transients I thought to myself, but at
1237 a distant male appeared with an open saddle! J26!
...See more photos and read full summary report at CWR Encounter 122. -Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research

Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - North Puget Sound - Of all the years I've been here, I've never seen an Orca in the wild. I carry my camera everywhere I go just in case I hear of a report of whales. I got a text from a friend and left my company and the end of the Apple Cup. Grabbed my camera and son and rushed out the door! We were able to follow
5 Orcas from Penn Cove down to Monroe Landing
. My pictures aren't perfect, but the experience was amazing. Just listening to my son's adorable screams of excitement and pure joy made the whole experience just wonderful. I am so happy that they have finally returned to our beautiful island and I hope they continue to do so. I will never tire of their beauty and will run out the door every chance I can to see them. -Cynthia Vick Allen
