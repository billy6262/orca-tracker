When we headed over to Vancouver Island this morning, we never could have imagined we would be seeing
a couple transients so close from shore in Saanich Inlet! Here's T2B

We ended up with a gorgeous day of sunny, blue skies and a glass calm sea....Mystic Sea departed Anacortes at
10:45am with reports of transients near Smith Island traveling south. Once we arrived at
Lopez Island
, we went 15 miles due south to catch up with our first group of transients for today, the
T60s
. We stayed with this group for about half hour, when we saw in the distance another group of transients who seemed to be having lunch. Captain Monte cruised over just in time to see this group, the
T65s
, while they finished off a seal. We stayed and watched as they continued to feed on other seals, and even got a mouthful of seagull! This group included a large bull with a 6 foot dorsal fin, and several females and calves...-Amy W., Mystic Sea
