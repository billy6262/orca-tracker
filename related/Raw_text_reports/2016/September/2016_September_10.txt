Orca Sightings for September 10, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Headed out from Snug Harbor at

4:00 PM
on Saturday,
September 10 hoping to see southern residents. We knew some were down south and started to head that way but then got a report of whales up north which was closer and probably calmer conditions. We caught up with the
J16's on the south side of Saturna Island
, leisurely, and I mean leisurely (about 1.5 knots), traveling along. Also present were
J27 and his sister J31 of the J11's and I believe J28, J35 and J47 of the J17's
. I didn't have any images of the
J17's
until the end and I presume J54 was tucked down in as there were calves present. They were grouped in two very tight groups for the most part interchanging groupings periodically. They seemed very relaxed and unphased by a large container ship directly in their path. We were hoping the kiddos would get rambunctious but even they were perfectly content with their leisurely weekend swim through the beautiful Salish Sea. Here is the big guy J26 and little sister J36 swimming in perfect unison and harmony. -Debbie Stewart

5:39 p.m. - L12s and L54s flipped at Land Bank
...L12s in a resting line! L12s are now southbound off American Camp. -Monika Wieland
*
With whales (the L12s) in Haro Strait
. Tight family group, lots of big boys in the mix, exhales blowing in the breeze. Magic. Today was definitely different - and worth the swells, spray, and salty decks. -Barbara Bender/David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

The infrequently seen
L54 matriline with I think L84 Nyssa
in this shot. This afternoon as they crossed
Haro Strait
inbound towards San Juan Island. The L54's came in early this afternoon and we (Island Adventures) caught up with them off Victoria and came across Haro with them. As they crossed in resting pattern, little L117 Keta was swimming with big, L88 Wave Walker. -James Gresham

Left the marina with a mild breeze and sunshine, but with a definite fall feeling in the air! With reports of
many resident orcas heading southwest down Haro Strait
, we eagerly headed out to
Salmon Bank
to catch up with the leaders, who were moving pretty fast, with pauses to fish and play. We had a great visit with males
L89 Solstice (23 yrs old) and L85 Mystery (25 yrs old), females L77 Matia (29 yrs old) and her young daughter L-119 Joy (4 yrs old), as well as female L-22 Spirit
(est. 45 yrs old). There were some big breaches, spy hopping, rolling around, tail slaps, and pec slapping, though overall they seemed pretty intent on heading southwest. On the way home, the wind died down as we got some great looks at the magnificent Stellar Sea Lions on Whale rocks, and enjoyed the beauty of the small islands around Lopez. All photos taken with a 300 zoom lens and cropped. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

J16s
were also there so they weren't alone. Sounds like whales basically
spread from offshore of Salmon Bank to Swanson Channel and across both sides of Haro
. We saw lots of active foraging. J46 was babysitting J54 which was nice to see, and they were splashing around together so he had energy

12:45 p.m. - Just found all the J28s off Kellett
.

11:58 a.m. - We're alone with some Ks and Ls off Battleship, all Js plus more Turn Pt and further north
. -Monika Wieland

Saturday (Sept 10) between

9:30 am and
12:00 I watched approx 40 SRKWs traveling Northbound past San Juan County Park
. They were spread out over several miles and all across the channel in small family groups, pairs and singles. Single male was on the trailing end. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

9:00 a.m. -
I want to report seeing about
10-15 orcas between 9 and 10 am Saturday morning on the west side of San Juan Island by County Park
... they were in that area for a bit then continued Northward. -Shawn Hendricks

8:35 a.m. - Calls on Lime Kiln
, just started! -Ali Barratt

Humpback whales feeding west Juan de Fuca Strait near Neah Bay

Observed numerous breaches by large whales, presumed to be
humpbacks
. Observed from
W Beach Rd bluff a half mile north of Hastie Lake, Whidbey Island

8:00 a.m. - Humpback at Useless Bay (Whidbey)
. We spotted a humpback in front of our house at
8:00 am this morning at
Double Bluff, Useless Bay, Freeland, WA
. Rolling, maybe feeding, then headed out to the inlet. -Terry Smith
