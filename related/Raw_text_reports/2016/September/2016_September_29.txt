Orca Sightings for September 29, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:40 a.m. - saw two whales
frequently blowing water spouts over by Salmon Beach. Could see all the way from the Gig Harbor side! They were pretty tall spouts!! Could not see the bodies, but they were moving fairly quickly and headed south
towards the Narrows Bridge
. (Humpbacks?) -Gaby Kinnear

For approximately one week, back from Monday, we've had
3 to 5 dolphins traveling back and forth through Hammersley Inlet
during the day and night. A lot of activity. Not sure what was see in Oakland Bay in Monday. -Brenda Rix

11:19 a.m. -
I'm watching
at least two porpoises swim between Dash Point and the south end of Vashon
. I feel fairly certain that they were porpoises because of the quick way they were swimming and their small size...the size and shape of the their dorsal fins looked much more like a type of porpoise. -Heidi Vincent
