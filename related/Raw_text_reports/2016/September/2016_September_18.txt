Orca Sightings for September 18, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a message from Arlene Solomon calling
from Village Bay, Mayne Island, BC Canada, reporting a pod of 10 orcas with one calf passing by at
4:48 pm
, heading toward Active Pass or maybe Trinconelli Channel. Then at
5:48 pm they saw three more adult orcas pass by.
*
We spent time with members of
all 3 southern resident pods
today. Notably
L41, K35, L85 and the J17's
. I did not see J28 or J54 though. Still have to go through pics but I didn't notice her and was looking for her, although I heard she was sighted today. This is L41 Mega in close to the boat. At 39 he is the oldest and also the largest of the southern resident males.-James Gresham
*
A magic moment. Today we spent time with members of all
3 SRKW pods at Hein Bank
. As we drifted with engines off
J47 Notch
decided to pay us a visit. He came directly to the boat then turned and passed along the rail just under the water before surfacing right at my feet. Here he is just beginning to lift the surface film as he comes up. -James Gresham
