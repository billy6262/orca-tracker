Orca Sightings for September 20, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of J, K, & L pod
- "Orcinus" got underway again around
1055
and arrived on scene around 1130 off the north end of South Beach. The whales were very spread out again in singles and small groups.
J36
was seen chasing a salmon and K25 came over to her briefly before traveling south. A small group closer to shore included the
J35s and L85. J44 and J46
may also have been with this group briefly before dispersing....-Photos and full encounter summary at Center for Whale Research Encounter 101.

L88 and a humpback cross paths in the morning
off the west side of San Juan Island. -Mark Malleson
*

9:02 a.m. - Calls again at Lime Kiln
after silence for a couple of hours.

5:48 a.m. - Calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone
behind extremely obnoxious vessel noise. Sometimes I think they are having to yell over the noise, and this is why I suddenly hear them, as there has been no audible vocalisations until now. Either that, or this vessel does a really good impersonation of orca! -Ai Barratt
*

7:40 a.m. - heard faint calls on Lime Kiln Hydrophone
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

7:23 a.m. - Good morning Jpod Orcas on the hydro (Lime Kiln)

6:35 p.m. - We spotted a young humpback whale traveling alone northbound off Ebey's Landing
, approximately 50 yards from shore. This is the second time we have seen this whale, the first time being Sunday evening,
September 18th, traveling in the same manner (steadily northbound, close to the shore, and with many spyhops) and at the same time of evening--around
6:30 pm. The stubby dorsal fin was clearly seen through binoculars verifying a humpback. Spyhopping; traveling. -Laura Golden

Gray Whale CRCID 30
(left side & blow holes) -
Cattle Pass (South end of San Juan Channel)
, heading south into Straits of Juan De Fuca. -Connie Bickerton,

Sandy Dubpernell received a message from Marty Crowley at

10:34 a.m. who was on the ferry to Port Townsend and reports a whale
of some sort (not an orca) off the port side of the ferry mid channel
between Keystone and Port Townsend
.
