Orca Sightings for September 19, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Members of J and K pods headed north past CWR in the morning while K and L pods members had been sighted heading in toward San Juan Island behind them
. We delayed our departure to let a heavy rain squall blow through before heading down to Snug Harbor..."Orcinus" saw K43 heading south by herself off Pile Point at 1148. The whales were very spread out in singles and small groups so the next group Dave encountered was
J28, J46, and J54 at 1205 off of American Camp
. This threesome was in a tight group heading slowly southeast.
J28 and J54 were still looking very thin

5:57 p.m. - Lots of whales visible from American Camp
heading north, for the moment anyway. Some close to shore. -Monika Wieland Shields

Breathtaking - there's no other word to describe today's encounter with the Southern Resident orcas. Dampness soon gave way to sunshine and sparkling seas after we left the dock, passing Colville Island on our route to the south side of San Juan Island where members of
L-pod, including Mega (L-41)
, the exquisitely marke
d Racer (L-72) and her son Fluke (L-105)
ranged freely with their family, grouping up for a photo-shot as they passed under the watchful eye of Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research. These are the most studied whales in the world, and the Center has been responsible for photo-identification studies on this endangered population since the start of Orca Survey in 1976. In addition, the orcas are currently being monitored by hexagram under NOAA's permit to collect images for health assessment. Chinook salmon is what they need to survive - and plenty of it. Our return route took us past Bird Rocks, which not only provides refuge to our feathered friends but also to Pacific Harbor seals and Steller sea-lions, one of which looked as though it had learned to fly! -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.

Here are a few photos of the
T100 and T65B transient (Bigg's) killer whale pods attacking a Steller sea lion between Point Hudson and Whidbey Island
on Sept. 19 2016. The killer whales appeared to attack the sea lion by ramming it head first, and by striking it with their tail flukes over and over again. They were using a technique that seems to be pretty common when they target a Steller sea lion. They start with a frenzy of attacks, then they swim away (100-300 yards) as if they've decided to move on, then they circle back and start another frenzy of attacks. Then they swim away again, and circle around for another attack. They repeated this "attack, leave, circle back, and attack again" sequence over and over again! The sea lion must have been significantly injured, judging by his labored rolling around at the surface, but somehow he found shelter in a mat of floating bull kelp. He wrapped himself in the kelp as much as possible, and this seemed to be a relatively successful strategy because the killer whales were more cautious with the tangle of bull kelp in their way. I've seen this on multiple occasions, where seals or sea lions take shelter in or on bull kelp and it always seems to hinder the effectiveness of the killer whales attacks - at least for a while. The killer whales don't seem to want to slash right through the kelp. It looks like they try to create powerful currents with their bursts of speed, and tail fluke kicks, to wash their prey away from the kelp. On this particular occasion T100 seemed to be doing most of the really hard work, but T65B also played a significant roll in the attack. Occasionally the younger pod members would slash at the sea lion, as if they were mimicking their mother's work. 14 year old male, T100C, didn't appear to be involved very much, if at all, in the real attacking work at the surface. -Bart Rulon

A few minutes from our docks in Sooke we start seeing
Humpback Whale blows towards Otter Point and to our surprise there was at least 60+ a few miles off shore
...Just so amazing to see again! On our way to Race Rocks Lighthouse we came across the
T11 & T11a Transient / Biggs Killer Whales right out front of Sooke Harbour
...but they did not go in this time...Wow September is Great! -Paul Pudwell
*

4:00 p.m. -
Unidentified killer whales - this afternoon, and group of
four Orcas (including possibly on adult male) were playing in Brown's Bay, North of Campbell River
. They were on the east side of the bay, which is unusual for this spot; they are usually in the middle of the channel. They stayed mostly at the surface, blowing and even vocalizing! They stayed for about 15 minutes and then continued south. -Laura Grandmont

Entry 2:

7:00 p.m. - Puget Sound - I saw a single Humpback whale off of the north side of Blake Island
around 7pm on Monday
September 19th. I watched it circle around back and forth diving for short periods for approximately 1 hr. until it got dark. -Paul Ruppert
*

2:53 p.m. - Just passed another humpback heading south on Colvos Passage just south of Pt. Richmond
. Given path of travel for the first, it's likely two different whales. -Andrea Hennings
*
We also came home to find these reports of the first humpback from Mark Mallard of WDFW at

1:20 pm
, in front of the Ram Restaurant in Ruston,
in Commencement Bay
; and a call from Maia of the WA State Ferries, reporting
a humpback at
1:40 pm near the Pt. Defiance dock
.
*

1:33 p.m. - Humpback just off the Ram Restaurant on Ruston Way in Tacoma
. -Andrea Hennings
