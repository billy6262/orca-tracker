Orca Sightings for September 11, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Started my shift as the naturalist at the
San Juan Island Land Bank just as members of K and L pods came in close to shore
, others were spread out to mid channel. Positive IDs for
L55s, L90, K44 Ripple, L92, K13s, K14s. One lone humpback
also got in on the fun. Could actually hear the HB and some Ks vocalizing above water! -Ariel Yseth
*

7:00 a.m. - J26 and other members of the southern resident clan
in the early morning calm. Near
Washington Park, Anacortes
- off Burrows Bay, Rosario Strait. Spotted several Orcas at approximately 7 am on both ends of Burrows Bay along the Rosario Strait (near Washington Park). They were very active. Could not count all of the whales, but there seemed to be upwards of 20 throughout the Strait and Bay. Playing and feeding. 1 total breach. -Neal Wychock
*
Surprising us all,
members of J-pod were found off-shore of Lopez Island
, very spread out. First whale we spotted was
J-27 Blackberry
, born in 1991. We stopped to watch and found there were whales spread on both sides of us, close to shore and way out west. Others we found were the
J17s, some J16s, J-27
, and towards the end of our viewing
a few L-pod whales
! What a great day we had with these amazing mammals, such a privilege to see them! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
*

1:40 p.m. - They were spread across Haro
. Trailers off Land Bank Southbound now, -Monika Wieland
*

12:30 p.m. - SRKWs on Lime Kiln Hydrophone
. -Connie Bickerton
*
I saw them again as they traveled south past the park between

11:45 -
12:15
, then I went down to the
Land Bank Westside Preserve
, and finally
American Camp
, where they headed out southwesterly into open water. Took a few photos, will share later if any of them came out at all! -Donna Green Van Renselaar
*
My husband and I were on our private vessel and saw whales. ...This was about
noon, a little north of Lime Kiln
, a little south of Mosquito Pass. We killed our engine and drifted for over an hour while whales swam by on all sides. We heard blows, turned to see one whale, heard another blow, turned to see another, like whirling dervishes trying to see them all. Somewhere between one and two dozen. Also had our hydrophone in the water an hour earlier and heard them in the vicinity. Magical experience! These photos taken by my daughter Adrienne Domingus. -Cathryn Rice, Olalla, WA
*

12:10 p.m. -
Moving very slowly very spread none have passed the light yet. From
Lime Kiln I only saw the K12s, K13s, K14s, and L91s I think
.

11:43 a.m. - First whales in sight from Lime Kiln
.

11:08 a.m. -
Just started hearing faint vocals on the
OrcaSound hydrophone
. Assuming southbound. -Monika Wieland
*
Crew and passengers witnessed a remarkable phenomenon described by scientists in a new study published just this summer-
humpback whales interfering with hunting transient killer whales
. Doesn't seem to matter what species they're hunting, the humpbacks don't like it. Scientists continue to debate the reason for this "vigilante" behaviour, which has been documented at multiple sites around the world over decades. Now they can add
southern Vancouver Island to the list...The T100 and T65B families of transient killer whales. Five whales in total....4 humpbacks we think
. Several times, the orcas retreated to regroup as if they were contemplating their next move. Or waiting for the humpbacks to go away. The stand-off ended with the transients swimming off, apparently deciding that four angry humpbacks weren't worth the trouble. Score: Team Humpback 1, Team Orca 0. It's not known whether Team Sea Lion survived its injuries or was attacked again later. -Eagle Wing Tours
*
An orca cruises past the humpbacks, trying to get to the sea lion hiding among them. The humpbacks grouped together, blocking access to the sea lion, thrashing their tails and exhaling forcefully in an aggressive or agitated behaviour we call trumpeting. They repeatedly advanced on the orcas.

Entry 2:
*
Members of each team are visible here.
Two humpbacks in the foreground
, the
sea lion floating in the background
(probably not feeling so good by this point), and
an orca heading toward it
. -Valerie Shore
*
Also an interesting thing we observed today
at Lime Kiln: a humpback whale came north into the southbound residents and started trumpeting with every surfacing as it came within a few hundred yards of the whales
. It was fluking on every surface and then turned west and wasn't seen again....Just ID'd the HB as
BCY0409 - Yogi.
-Monika Wieland

...and definite
humpback traveling North in front of Land Bank West Side Preserve on Sunday between

1:00-
2:00 pm.
.. it was maybe 150 yards yards off shore. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
*

10:14 a.m. - pod of 5 to 10 porpoises heading north in Admiralty Inlet
, possibly some infants or young. Spotted originally near Lagoon Point, Whidbey. -Rachael Alyson
*

9:00 a.m. - Spotted an Elephant seal near Edmonds Marina
(north of) today while on a bird watching tour as part of Bird Fest. Looks like a juvenile or female- not sure. -Terry Nightingale
