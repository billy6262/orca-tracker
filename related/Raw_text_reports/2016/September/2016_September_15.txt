Orca Sightings for September 15, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Summer is lingering in the Salish Sea, with another beautiful, warm, sunny day as we left the marina a little early...which was good as the
reports came in of J pod way north of the coal docks (BC) but heading south
. After a 3 hour cruise through Georgia Strait, we caught up with them, slowly heading south. In the
group of about 20 orcas, we enjoyed a great visit with J36 Alki and calf J52 Sonic, J16 Slick and calf J50 Scarlet, J42 Echo,big males Mike J26 and Blackberry J27, J47 Notch and his mom J35 Tahlequah, and others in the J17 group
. They were foraging, with some breaching, tail slapping, and nice roll overs. At first they were fairly well spread out, but they grouped up tightly, which is such a beautiful sight to see! The water was glass smooth, perfect orca appreciation conditions! With a fond farewell, we head home through the sparkling late afternoon, catching a look at some harbor seals steaming in the sun. Another fabulous day on Mystic Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
