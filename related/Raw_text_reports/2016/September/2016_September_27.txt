As the sun was setting,
a pair of humpbacks surfaced in Welbury Bay
, no more than 20 meters off the south shore of the Scott Point peninsula. Pretty delightful. -Peter Reiner,
Salt Spring Island

A
pair of humpback whales passed within 100 feet of shore at Lime Kiln Point State Park
on Tuesday. They were headed north at
12:45 pm. One had a nick in its dorsal fin (as clearly visible in one of the photos). It would be interesting to know if it is individually known by that feature. -Andrew Redding
