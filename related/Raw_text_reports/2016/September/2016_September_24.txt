============================================================

Entry 1:
We love Sooke in September! We had the pleasure of visiting
J Pod and others with 7 Humpbacks South of Jordan River
TODAY! -Paul Pudwell

T109A's off Victoria
, BC today. Sad to see them without T012A who swam with them until his recent passing. -James Gresham
*
Cool and overcast as we left the marina, but luckily with smooth waters and no wind. With no reports of whales at first, we headed south west, but shortly heard that
a group of Transients (Bigg's), were heading north east, moving fast, past San Juan Island
. We caught up with them at
Kelp Reef
in Canada, after a long but beautiful trip, waving to a pod of harbor porpoises on the way. There were
about 7-8 whales
, in two groups, with
one male (T60C)
, one fairly small juvenile, and the rest females. They were relentlessly porpoising north west,showing the incredible power of their speed, though with some directional changes. We had heard they had made a kill or two earlier, so seemed determined to plow on. With beautiful glassy water, big clouds, and the ever-beautiful Salish Sea scenery, we left them by Big and Little Darcy Islands. There were a few Steller Sea Lions in the water, but they were not on the menu today. The sun came out and everyone enjoyed the trip inter-island, through Pole Pass and home. All pictures taken with a 300 zoom and cropped. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

. Humpback activity in these waters is relatively infrequent. -James McLarnon

Hello: Possible Minke? (confirmed
humpback
by others) We observed a whale (1-2. I saw one, others reported 2)
in northern Case Inlet off of the north side of Herron Island - Puget Sound
. Folks said that pictures confirmed as a Humpback, but as the whale blew, it surfaced in a sinuous motion, seemed narrow, and the dorsal fin was far to the rear; no flukes were displayed. Blows and surfacing were followed by dives lasting a few minutes. The whale did not breach...rather resembled a sea serpent. -Christine Mohr
*

5:25 PM.. Whale headed 1/4 mile north of Harstine Island bridge.
Two big, noisy, blows but did not surface much. -Gretchen Stewart
*
1 Humpback departing Totten Inlet
4:30ish pm towards Hope Island
. Circled the Island on the east side and turned around heading back towards Shelton. Several blows and a nice show of the full tail! Beautiful...-Tracy Parascand
*
Apparently around

2:30 at least one of these animals ended up near Burfoot Park (Budd Inlet)
and then traveled across from there to Hunter Point (
Eld Inlet
). It is flat calm. Unfortunately I didn't see it and it passed right in front of my house! -Kim Merriman
*
We just saw
one humpback in front of Steamboat Marina at Eld Inlet
on the Hope Island side about

2:30pm
. It was headed north. -Dee Ann Clayton Larsen
*
Approx

10:30 a.m. - There were 3 (humpbacks), one big and two small in Case Inlet
. They were at the end near Herron island. Our ferry boat had to stop. They were headed south down the west side of the island, between Herron and Harstine Islands. -Suzy Fountaine
*

9:00 a.m. -
Received a call from Dennis Ryan reporting a humpback whale in the channel
between Coupeville and Port Townsend - Admiralty Inlet
. Seen from the ferry at
9:00. Heading north. Was gray to black in color, seemed normal. -Sandra Dupbernell
