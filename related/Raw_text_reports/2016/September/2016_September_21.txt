Members of

- Ken was delivering "Chimo" to its new base of operations in Port Angeles when he encountered whales at the confluence of Haro Strait and the eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca at 1139. The lead whales were already
spreading out and heading up Haro Strait, and as usual J2 "Granny" and her escort L87 were in the lead

So many dorsal fins! With all the Southern Residents around, we've been getting odd groups of mixed up whales every day, making it really fascinating, though really hard to ID who is where! Today we spent some time with a group of
about 15 whales made up of matrilines from J, K, and L Pods. J17 Princess Angeline and J53 Kiki
this afternoon - for those wondering, J17's oldest daughter J28 Polaris wasn't far behind, and was traveling with her two offspring. She is still looking thin, but the fact that she's made it this long proves she's a fighter! -Monika Wieland Shields

15-year-old J37 Hy'Shqa launches as Js and Ks make their way in Haro Strait
, San Juan Island. -im Maya

2:30 p.m. - A pod of orcas seen off the coast of Clover Point in Victoria, BC

Saw a
lone adult male orca
from the Schooner Adventuress today at

2:45pm just 3/4 mile nautical miles NNW of Blake Island
! He breached a few times, both full and half and was tail and pectoral slapping. Looked like he was having a ball! Best educated guess from our ID guide is that it was T49C. -Jennifer Smith
*
This young sickly looking
humpback was encountered this morning traveling southbound mid channel in Admiralty Inlet, near Bush Point
. -Janine Harles
*
Was on my SUP 1/2 mile off
Three Tree Point, Burien- central Puget Sound, ... large whale w/large spout (15')
heading south. One whale, humpback whale type dorsal fin! -Matt Parker

This morning, while
walking in Lincoln Park (West Seattle) at around
