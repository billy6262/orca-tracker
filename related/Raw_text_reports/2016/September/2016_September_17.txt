Orca Sightings for September 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
7 miles south of Salmon Bank, we picked up Transient/Biggs killer whales - T100s, T101s, T102, and T65B's
, what a find! We enjoyed watching these amazing mammals as they leisurely traveled SE back towards Smith Island. Homeward bound, we checked out Steller sea lions on Bird Rocks, an unusual haul-out for them. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

6:25 p.m. - Humpback

8:55 a.m. -
Tony Woelke from WS Ferries just called to report a breaching
humpback 1-1/2 miles out from the Edmonds ferry dock
. It is now traveling southbound and is currently between the two ferries.

4:51p.m. - Single Whale of some type surfacing North of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge
, heading towards Salmon Beach. Looked too small to be Humpback too big for Porpoise. -Melissa Burke
