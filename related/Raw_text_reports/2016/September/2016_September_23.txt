Orca Sightings for September 23, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Challenging sea conditions failed to deter Mystic Sea's resilient passengers today as
one of our known humpbacks, BCY0409 (Yogi
- also seen in Hawaii), zigzagged among the whitecaps off Flattop Island, another of the wildlife reserves in the San Juans. Flying spume hit the decks along with the 'sweet' smell of whale breath carrying on the wind, as Yogi made several directional changes keeping everyone guessing as to which way next... Three breaches in a row caught photographers by surprise when we arrived on scene - did anybody out there get that shot? -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
