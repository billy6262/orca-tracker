Orca Sightings for September 14, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
..."Orcinus" next encountered
K27, J17, J44, and J53 spread out near the south end of Kellett Bluff. J44 and J53 were working together in a slow chase of a salmon. A little farther north up the bluff, K13, K20, and K38 were in a tight group moving south a few hundred yards west of Kellett. Another whale was traveling alone closer to the bluff and this was J28.
She was looking thin as she moved slowly south down Kellett Bluff. "Orcinus" only spent a few minutes with J28 before helping the NOAA research boat get on her... Photos and full summary report at CWR Encounter 99. -Center for Whale Research Staff

We went up to the San Juans and spotted a number of
orcas at the mouth of Haro Strait, west of San Juan Island
. I didn't keep an accurate count of how many we saw - hard to do if you don't know them apart, and many of them were at a distance, but I'd guess we probably saw between 10 and 15 whales, not counting some transients... -Winston Rockwell

Went on an epic adventure westward exploring the Strait of Juan de Fuca today! We did 151 miles and went all the way out to
Sombrio Point on Vancouver Island
. Wildlife and jaw-dropping scenery galore out there! I have so many photos to get through but wanted to pick one that summed up our day. Group after
group after group of Humpback Whales
. Such a beautiful day in the incredible Salish Sea. -Traci Walter

Victory and Split Fin, Humpbacks
travelling together, just a half mile or so North of the T037's, near Dungeness Spit. -Janine Harles
*

2:30 p.m. - Flight of two of these guys in Hammersley Inlet
. Heading west. I have not seen them return so I believe they are still in Oakland Bay. -Pamela S Burger
*
There have been
at least five of the common dolphins
in the area over the past many days. The last sighting was of them
heading north out of Budd Inlet
. That makes a visit to Hammersley Inlet a high possibility. -Kim Meriman
*

9:20 a.m. -
A report by Diane Nelson of
"two juvenile orcas" (Common dolphins) in Hammersly Inlet
at the cove inside Cape Horn for at least 1.5 hours.
*

9:00 a.m. -
From the land, We saw
two Harbor porpoise
(possibly Orca, saw dark black fish with fins, floating up and down into the water)
between Fox Island and the south tip of Gig Harbor (Wollochet) about 7pm on Sept 13
. More close to the south tip of the Gig Harbor (Wollochet). They seemed to stay in the same area. In the morning of Sept 14 (about 9am), we saw three in the same area again. They are on the boat routes and we did see boats crossing near the area where porpoise were seen....I googled porpoise and it looks like what we saw could be porpoises. (intially reported as orcas, with further discussion believe to be porpoise). -Qin Zhang
