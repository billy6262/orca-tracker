Orca Sightings for May 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whale watching aboard the Washington State Ferries at it's finest.
"Transient orcas chasing Dall's porpoise.
When you get back on the ferry to go home and you are met with sights like this right before you enter the harbor of your tiny island paradise!" -Katie Jones

I had a delightful sunset encounter with the
T75Bs and T77s tonight in San Juan Channel
, just outside of Friday Harbor. -Traci Walter

6:52 p.m. -
still there, line of sight
Double Bluff from Brackets Landing North in Edmonds
, several miles away. -Sherman Page
*

6:31 p.m. - pod on kill (looks like!) line of sight middle of Admiralty Inlet between Point No Point and south Whidbey
. Lots of thrashing.. Breaches.. Etc. After spending most of the day cruising the far reaches of Puget Sound, taking in this beautiful day - And, all the while keeping an eye out for reported Orcas - It wasn't until we returned home that I spotted an Orca Pod many miles west in Admiralty Inlet. Spotted this Pod of Transient Orcas this evening line of sight well east of Point No Point and South Of Useless Bay (South Whidbey Island). The behavior of the Orcas seems very likely they had made a kill and became very active! Long distance video from north Edmonds shoreline to subjects 4-5 miles out. -Stu Davidson

. Was out towards the shipping lane, northbound. Only saw 1 and only surfaced one time. -Sara Frey
