Orca Sightings for May 20, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:40 pm -
we made it to
Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, just in time to spot the
Puget Sound transients heading north
with purpose, no milling, no foraging, passing Lagoon Point and continuing onward towards the glow of the setting sun. What a way to end another glorious day in the Pacific Northwest with nature at its best. -Sandra Pollard

7:08 p.m. - One male dorsal coming north to on Mutiny Bay
, Whidbey Island now. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

7:01 p.m. - Orcas spotted just north past Double Bluff
. Victoria Clipper had slowed down to watch them. -Martha Carlstead

headed north towards Double Bluff.

Day report
T137s, T125A & T128
. Awesome day on Puget Sound today! Spotted
a pod of Orcas in Elliott Bay
(between Seattle and Bainbridge Island) heading north. Paralleled the pod as I made my way back to Edmonds Marina (Homeport). A number of times the pod dove deep and for a long time only to come up and close in on me. I always stopped the engines and raised the props from the water! I soon found out why the Orcas were zig zagging and double backing / "stalking" me!
A sea lion was apparently using my boat as refuge / hiding place
. At one time I had the sea lion trying to get on my transom while up to six Orcas were surrounding my boat! These photos represent a sample of the encounters - I also have some video I'll post (YouTube) of the Orcas pursuing the sea lion.n

3:04 p.m. -
still shaking! S
ea lion hiding under my boat. Orcas all up to the sides and under.
I haven't seen the sea lion since and the orcas have continued north. WOW -Stu Davidso
*

2:50 p.m. - they've stalled most likely on kill south of Kingston
. West side of mid channel.

1:40p.m. -
Stu found them further north. Currently
mid channel north Richmond Beach and south of Kingston
.

1:15 p.m. -
They went stealthy on him. Stu was not able to relocate pod after long dive. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

12:30 p.m. - 4-5 ORCA
(1 large male was observed) passed by
Blake Island around
12:30
heading north. They were going by slowly, probably feeding and mid-channel between Blake and West Seattle. -Paul Ruppert, Park Ranger
*

11:00 a.m. - About 6 whales in the pod
with little baby orca staying close to mamma. Right by the shore of
South beach, Bainbridge
. Traveling, possibly feeding. Sea lions in the area as well. -Leann Ling
*
Here are a few photos from today's
transient superpod in Rosario Strait
. The killer whales present included, at least, the
T11s, T65As, T65Bs, T93, and T97
! T11 and T11A were very active! They both tail slapped over and over again. T11A got the acrobatics started with a breach, followed by a double breach with his mom, T11, and then she followed it up with a couple solo breaches of her own. After a break of a few minutes T11A breached another 4 times in a row, and T11 cartwheeled at the same time!! 4 of the photos attached are of big T11A breaching, and one is of his mom, T11, breaching. -Bart Rulon
*
First double breach of orcas I have ever captured! And, it's
in front of Orcas Island! T11A and possibly T11
. -Renee Beitzel
*

12:10 p.m. - Orcas still milling in Rosario Strait
west of Burrows Island.

11:15 a.m. - Orcas traveling north just west of Williamson Rocks
. 4 whale watching boats observing from reasonable distance. I'm high bank on Edith Point, too far for count or ID. Edith Point is west side of Fidalgo Island above Burrows and Langley Bay. -Anne Hazen
*
T002C's off Victoria
, BC. We also got to see T002C2, an eleven-year-old male that has scoliosis. -Heather MacIntyre

T10B and T077A male bonding in Cowichan Bay
. -Mark Malleson

Sorting oysters in Deep South Sound and sighted
either a gray or humpback about
10:30 AM today in Totten Inlet
. It headed up the bay into Oyster bay and then
about
11:30 returned, headed North toward Steamboat
. -Duane Fagergren
*

8:50 a.m. -
Orca Network received a call from Michelle Auseth reporting
a gray whale between Hope Island and Arcadia
, heading toward Steamboat. She saw the whale blow as we spoke on the phone. (Timing and location would indicate probable humpback)
*

7:00 a.m. - Humpback whale Hammersley Inlet
, Shelton, WA. traveling east out of the inlet to the Sound. -Pamela S Burger
*

2:25 p.m. -
Something Big off Whidbey see from Mukilteo Lighthouse beach. -JJ Davern
