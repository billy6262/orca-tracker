Orca Sightings for May 13, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 44 Summary: The morning started before 9am with Jane Cogan calling to relay an earlier report of
20+ whales coming in off the Victoria waterfront
and that she was now hearing them on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone. Mark Malleson got out on the water and found the whales in Mike 1 and then reported to us that the
K12's and K13's were present along with J pod and L87
...
*
Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca as many J's and a few K's foraged and socialized between Salmon Bank and Hein Bank.
So great to see them having some down time with each other! Southern Resident Killer Whale,
J19 Shachi
, born in 1979, decided she was going to give us a really close "swim by" off our stern! Sometimes, these animals are just as curious about us, as we are of them. Moments like this are so short lived. -Renee Beitzell

Js and the Ks today off the south side of San Juan Island
