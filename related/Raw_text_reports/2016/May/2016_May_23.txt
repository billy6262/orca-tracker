Boundary Pass/Haro Strait -
Bigg's/Transients tuck into and cruise the shoreline of Wescott Bay, San Juan Island
. For the first time since my parents bought their place on San Juan (10+ years) and the stars aligned so that we were up there, we had
4 transients
in our bay today. We stood onshore as they cruised in and around for a bit probably looking for seals, then left out to Mosquito Pass and Haro Strait I would presume. We are on
Westcott Bay and look into Garrison Bay
. We didn't get any real good ID shots in the few photos we got, but here is one of the better pictures. Let me know if anyone else reported T's and if we know who they might be! -Kalley Genther
*
Big group
6-8 transients
, three young and one big male, and a second group of two males and a female
heading south on Boundary Pass
! We first met up with them west and south of Blunden in Canadian waters, then they followed the border and turned south at Stuart.

1:30 p.m.
Left them still heading south/southwest down Haro Strait. I think the male with the big group was
T123A
, also think we saw T65B and T65B1 and some other youngsters and another two females, and then the two large males and solo female traveling a few hundred yards behind them. Looked like a kill at

12:30
, then lazy traveling with playful youngsters. Lots of lobtailing, spyhopping and some porpoising! -Jessica Alexandra Doyle

4:00 p.m. -
Seemed every time I looked out across the water today I spotted this
Humpback Whale in Possession Sound
(North Puget Sound - South of Useless Bay). Earlier I watched as it surfaced for a few blows then it arched into a deep dive showing off it's huge flukes as it dove. It must have been feeding. Later this afternoon, when I again spotted the Humpback, it was at the surface for some R&R time seemingly just enjoying a few sun breaks! Filmed from North Edmonds shoreline. Whale was ~5 miles out.

12:20 p.m. - huge whale (humpback) heading west
- deep dive fluke was BIG ! Line of sight
mid channel of Admiralty Inlet
. Would be east of Point No Point and South of Scatchet Head. Line of sight reference was from North Edmonds. -Stu Davidson
