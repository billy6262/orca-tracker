Orca Sightings for May 3, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening from

5:30 to
6:30
we were on scene with the
J16s in San Juan Channel
. First they were heading south, but then they did a big arc around, aiming momentarily for President's Channel before finally
heading north past Flattop towards Boundary Pass
. They were all traveling in a tight, slow-moving group. -Monika Wieland
*
The
J16's had been found off the west side of San Juan Island in the morning. By 1305, the J16's had moved slowly north past CWR
about a quarter mile off the reef. Ken and Dave left a while later to see the T's in Boundary Pass (Encounter 38-1). We ended that encounter at 1613 and decided to briefly check out the J16's who were reported to be heading east in Spieden Channel at that time. We arrived on scene at 1634 about a mile east of Battleship Rock.
The J16's milled some and went on a long dive before coming up on the north side of Spieden Channel just a little east of Sentinel Island
. We left the J16's soon afterward at 1652 as they moved closer to the Spieden Island shoreline and headed slowly east in a tight group. -Center for Whale Research Encounter 39

Half day sail with enthusiastic friends. Met the
J16's in Spieden Channel
. Close to shore swimming against a strong ebb. Steller sea lions grouped together and the J16's were acting like transients... silent underwater with a 180 degree direction change. Beautiful crisp blows and reflections in placid waters of Minke Pond. Clearing north of Flattop we headed home in the evening light. -Barbara Bender/David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Spent some time with the
J16's on the west side
. J26 and J42 were bringing up the rear, south of Lime Kiln, while J16, J50, J36 and J52 lead the way, being very active and social, were heading north past Lime Kiln. -Renee Beitzel
*
A large number of
transients had been found in the late morning off East Point
. Since the whales were still in the Patos Island area and seemed to be pointed toward Boundary Pass by early afternoon, Ken and Dave decided to go out and take a look. They left aboard Orcinus at 1355 and arrived on scene just a little southwest of the Patos Island Lighthouse on Alden Point at 1435. The T86A's, T100B's, T124A's, and the T101's minus T102 were in a fairly tight group heading slowly southwest pointed down Boundary Pass. The whales were active and were being social. A group consisting of T124A2A, T86A3, and T86A's newest calf T86A4 lagged a little behind... -Center for Whale Research Encounter 38.

17 Biggs killer whales
being incredibly social. Started off with tons of tail lobbing and breaching from the kids, then they all got together in a big group and were almost stationary at the surface, rolling around on one another. We shut down and watched for a while and after a long dive they popped up right beside us! We got a really good look at
T86A's
overbite on her lower jaw and got to see one of the newest calves,
T86A4
. Won't forget that one anytime soon! -Gary Sutton
*
There was a
T-party out in the Strait of Georgia today---and it included T86A4, the newest kiddo of T86A
.-Sara Hysong-Shimazu

8:00 p.m. - Orcas in Hood Canal
? I just saw from the shore what looked to be about
4 Orcas just out from Potlatch
(Hood Canal), feeding. -Travis Hultquist
*

7:10 a.m. - I saw two just North of Hoodsport
. Absolutely amazing!!! The first I have seen in the wild! -Chelsea Sendzik
*
Transients in Sansum Narrows about noon
, we encountered what looked like a family of
3 Orcas travelling south towards Burial Island
and beyond: Papa, Mama and Baby. I only had my lumix camera but managed to get one photo of the male. -Tamar Griggs
