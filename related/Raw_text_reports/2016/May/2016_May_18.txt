Entry 1:

Bart Rulon called with a sighting of
orcas heading south past Bush Point
. Just south of Bush Point, when
T125A and T128 were swimming in with the T137s
. There was plenty of interaction between the three big guys,
T137A, T125A, and T128
. David Ellifrit (Center for Whale Research) tells me that T125A has been photographed off Point Reyes, California two years in a row. -Bart Rulon
