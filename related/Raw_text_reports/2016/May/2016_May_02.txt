Orca Sightings for May 2, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
After the
J16's were found in Boundary Pass,
Dave left Snug Harbor in Orcinus at
1345 and arrived on scene off Bedwell Harbor at 1415. J36 and J52 were heading southwest toward Turn Point about a mile south of Tully Point on South Pender Island
. J26 was another three quarters of a mile to the east of J36 and J52 also heading slowly toward Turn Point. The other three J16's were reported to be much closer in to Bedwell Harbor...-Center for Whale Research Encounter 37.
*
From today during our sail with the
J16's
. One of J36 breaching in front of the Center for Whale Research. They traveled rather quickly southbound with the ebb tide with occasional stops for fishing.

5:30 p.m. - We left the J16's off Pile Pt
- heading for home. We had the hydro in many times throughout the day. Very little talking - a few faint squeaks and echo.

4:04 p..m. - Passing Lime Kiln

1:15 p.m. - T18 and 19B's in Haro
today going north. Transients, aka "Bigg's Killer whales" (marine mammal eating ecotype)...
Two humpbacks were feeding the area
but the T's ignored them entirely.

41 year-old, T018
She travels with the
T019's
with humpback 1/4 mile (if that) in background. We were with them today as they traveled north in
Haro Strait
. -Renee Beitzel

I took this on Monday from my Kayak:) I think there are
4 of them 2 big ones and two smaller ones
. They were eating a seal, so I am assuming they are transient whales. They are so incredible!! They were at the
mouth of the Duckabush river between

2:30-
3:30
on Monday. They headed up the canal toward Union about
3:40. -Jennifer Nehr

9:40 a.m. - There are actually four
. Saw them northbound
off Ayock point
. Gradual movement north then chased a seal. -Mitch Bogrand
