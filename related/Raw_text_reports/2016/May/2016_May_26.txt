I went out to look for the humpback about 7pm and found two! They were at the very
southern end of Colvos passage between Gig Harbor and Vashon
. I think they were very similar sized adults. -Michelle Riley Campbell

5:15 p.m. - Single humpback right off the shore at Browns Point
headed south towards Ruston surfacing often and moving pretty quickly. -Meghan Davis van Horn
*

12:30 p.m. - probable humpback between West Seattle and Blake Island,
west channel. A couple blows and shallow dives followed by a deeper dive with visible flukes, all before I could grab binoculars or camera. Haven't seen it since. It appeared to be moving south or southwest. -Jason Lee Bell
*
0800 - Gray whale South side of Southworth dock - it well could have been the humpback
. It just surfaced 3 times while I was waiting at the dock, all in the area between the dock and the northern tip of Colvos Passage. A couple of people said it was a gray, but I didn't think it had the tail of a gray when I saw it, the back looked more like a humpback to me but I'm no expert, so I took their word for it. One of the ferry dock workers, Nicole I think, said it was hanging around the south end of the dock, seemed to be more when the tide was turning. She said usually they hang out between the north end of Southworth Dock and Blake Island. -Kristie Paylor

5:30 a.m. - Lone humpback whale east side of Duwamish Head
heading slowly NNW very close to shore at shallow depth. -Charlie Piston, NOAA
