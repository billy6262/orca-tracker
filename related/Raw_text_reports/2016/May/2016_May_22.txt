Orca Sightings for May 22, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Trip report - a nice surprise when Sunday turned out to be such a beautiful day. We left the dock with no reports of whales in the area ...until somebody spotted two transient orcas known as the Twins
T093 (born in 1963) and T097 (born in 1980)by Partridge Bank
, west of Whidbey Island. These 2 whales have been travel companions for many years, and in amazing calm conditions we watched these two, leisurely milling back and forth. When we finally headed north towards home, we found
3 Minke whales near Smith Island
, tons of seabirds - including Tufted Puffins! On towards Lopez Island we had great views of harbor seals, bald eagles, and a California sea lion in Guemes Channel. What an exciting day. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
*

9:30 a.m. - "some" orcas milling about ~2-3miles offshore from Partridge point
. Whale watching boat nearby. (T93 & T97). -Al Lunemann
*

7:04 p.m. - They just turned into the entrance to Carr Inlet
, west of Fox Island. -Jeannie Majercin
*
Report: These photos were at quite a distance (not detailed shots, even with a 600mm), but the orcas were so active, I wanted to share. It's a rare treat to get a pod that is in play mode, rather than travel mode, and
from

5:15-7pm
, these guys just toured around the the waters
mid-channel between Steilacoom, McNeil and Fox
. We spotted them from the Anderson Island Ferry Dock around
5:15pm in front of the Chambers Bay/Steilacoom waterfront, and watched breach after breach, tail lobbing, and lots of splashing. The ferry was coming in, so we jumped on the
5:40 ferry to Steilacoom and they continued to be pretty active until the ferry got closer. At that point, they went dark and swam further out into the water toward McNeil. At the dock in Steilacoom, we saw them again in front of the prison and the cliffs north of the prison dock. Amazingly, they stayed put in the area for another 20 minutes while the ferry loaded, and as we headed back toward them at
6:30, they meandered around the waters between McNeil and Fox. They became very active again, with lots of breaches. There was one small dorsal that mostly stayed close to an adult female - a baby or young juvenile. In one photo in the album, it appears that
there might have been 6, but there were 5 for sure

6:46 p.m. - Between McNeil and Fox island
, trending west southwest

6:18 p.m. -They are just north of the McNeil ferry dock
, pretty stationary and milling.

6:07 p.m. - They are headed toward McNeil and Anderson
from Steilacoom.

5:21 p.m. - 3-5 orcas, south of chambers bay golf course
, north of chambers creek re bridge. Saw a full breach, very active. Heading south, close to Steilacoom shore. -Belen Bilgic Schneider
*

3:56 p.m. - Orcas just north of Tacoma Narrows Bridge
heading south. -Zeno Martin

Saw a few traveling very quickly south
through the Narrows past Titlow. This was about
3:50
. -Jennifer Rand
*

2:15 p.m. - 2 orcas seen from upper Sandy Shores, Vashon Island
heading south toward Manzanita Beach. Called in by Dennis Clouse.
*

7:21 a.m. -
WSF Ops reported
4 - 5 orcas off the Fauntleroy dock in W. Seattle
, no direction of travel given.
*
This morning
a small pod of Orcas was seen from the ferry departing
7:10 Vashon/Fauntlaroy sailing
. The Orcas were seen off the port bow about half way into the ferry ride, heading south down the center of the sound. Was not clear how many but there was at least two. I'm sorry it was the north end. They stopped the ferry for about 10 mins to let them pass by. -Dustin Prestridge
*

2:00 p.m. - Lakebay orca
sighting: 3 total, cow and two calves came through today. Feeding and played for a short period. First sighting we've in years. -Larry Cooper

11:20 a.m.- Three orca heading south out of Henderson Bay in South sound.
Midway between Raft Island and Minter Creek. Appeared to be one bull, large dorsal and two smaller orcas. One medium and one smaller. They were heading at a good clip up the bay breaching and tail slapping. -Kevin Stroh
*

9:05-
9:20 a.m. -
They are in
Henderson Bay! Just saw 3 of them right by Raft Island
- they were right by two small boats! hey were going back and forth being playful about 30 yards from the 2 boats, we left the house at
9:20am and they were still there, but we did not see which direction they ended up going after that. -Anne Mae Anderson
*

8:48 a.m. -
"Eric Bean Just saw
3-4 headed south
. Crossed in front of the ferry coming into
Steilacoom
" (distance and time dictates this is different group than
9:05 a.m. Henderson Bay group above - ALB) -Belen Schneider
*
Approx
6:00 a.m. - Saw 5 orcas near Otso Point, Anderson Island.
They were heading west. They were travelling and moving swiftly...Looked like they were heading south, as if to go around Anderson Island, or maybe towards Olympia, but not north. They were too far enough away get a close look or photos. -Susan Cammon
*

8:28 p.m. -
Pretty sure I just saw
humpback in Poverty Bay By Woodmont Beach (Des Moines).
-Mitzi Gligorea
*
Seattle Aquarium Beach Naturalists having our dress rehearsal were treated to a sighting from Golden Gardens park of
a lone humpback heading south along the shoreline
. First sighted at about

12:20 pm
. Kept a pretty steady pace surfacing 3-4 times and then fluking, last seen still heading south about
12:45. -Darcie Larson
*

7:44 a.m. - Humpback whale just passed by Salmon Beach,
north of Tacoma Narrows bridge, about 150 ft from shore. Traveling north. Saw its fluke but no photos. -Zeno Martin
