============================================================

Entry 1:
2:30 p.m. -
Good afternoon, we were blessed on the water today with
a small pod of Transients
swim past us. My first time seeing them so close, they just swam up to us. Thought I would share with you. This was at
Freshwater/Crescent Bay near Port Angeles
. Lots of whale boats coming out of Victoria/Canada trying to catch up to them. Was a Blessing to us today to see these Majestic animals. They were heading out west. (

T137s, T125A and 128

One Male Orca in the Siuslaw River, Florence OR. Saturday, the 28th, about 1730 hrs
, sighted male Orca breaching in river. Small fishing boat 'escorted' it at a distance until it went back over the bar and back into Pacific. Was sighted by someone else (before my video and sighting), about 30 minutes earlier about a mile or less up river, just south of the Siuslaw River Coast Guard Station. -Debbie Heldt Cordone

4:30 p.m. - Saw a whale swimming up the Washington Narrows and under the Manette bridge from the Boathouse restraunt
. This one had a small or irregular fin, couldn't tell which. What caught my eye was the lack of the large dorsal fin common to the Orcas which make periodic visits to the area. Also much larger animal What caught our attention was the large blow that towared 15 feet or more when he surfaced. -John Lorimer
