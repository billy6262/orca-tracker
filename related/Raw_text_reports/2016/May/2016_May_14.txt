============================================================

Entry 1:
T93 and T97 hanging out in the Straight of Georgia
. -Tasli Shaw
*

5:00 p.m. -
This was taken about
1/2 mile due west of Golden Gardens
...I'm sorry that we couldn't better capture the feeding frenzy which was taking place right before our eyes! We estimate 4-5 orcas. -Jaimeson Keegan
(
From Dave Ellifrit, Center for Wahle Research: "The male looks like it could be T137A but it's a little tough to confirm."
)

7:15 p.m. -
I wish to report the sighting of
at least 4 orca at approximately
7:15pm across from Sisters point about 200 yards off the south shore of lower Hood Canal
past the heading rapidly in the direction of Twanoh State Park. I assume these are the same Transient Orca which were observed Friday the 13th south of Dewato. They were fairly spread out and appeared to be hunting. -Mark Dennison
*

6:13 p.m. - Just spotted 4+ orcas
(including what appeared to be a large male) during a walk on the beach,
approximately 3 miles south of Dewatto Bay
. Orcas were a couple hundred yards offshore, and heading south. -Tristan Peter-Contesse
*

4:50 p.m. - Saw them heading south past Ayock Point
. -Lindsay Plethe
*

1:55 p.m. - Triton Cove heading south.
-Josh Cihak
*

1:20 p.m. - Orcas,
5 including 1 male-long fin, 2 med size, 2 smaller. ... One would separate, then slap flukes or tail with others in group 100-150 ft away. First saw off Lofall. Group proceeded slowly up to
Hood Canal Bridge
. Much blowing and huffing. Male had very long, skinny dorsal with no droop at tip. -Caroljean Mitchell
*
We had a great day on the Chilkat Express, heading into
Hood Canal to find the group of Transients
that have been hanging out there. We found not 4 (as reported) but
6/possibly 7 orcas! T75B and her one year old T75B2
were there, but so was another smaller calf (with a different female, I think T77)! Could it be a new one? Thanks Sara Hysong-Shimazu for helping me ID the T77s. -Justine Buckmaster
*
Chilkat Express, Puget Sound Express, with the
T's in Hood Canal just south of Hood Point
in the middle. 1200. Heading north at 4kts. -Rob Anderson
*
We saw three
orcas in Hood Canal at noon
off the girlscout camp (mile marker 317) about half way up the canal. They were heading north. Two females and a small one. -Debbie Harrington
*

11:48 a.m. - Just saw 3-4 come up for air across from Triton Cove, Hood Canal
closer to the Kitsap side. -Paul Nelson Jr
*
For the past several weeks,
Bigg's Killer Whales or Transients have been hanging out in the Southern Hood Canal
area. Well, we were finally able to get a peek at them. Unfortunately, we were
at Triton Cove, and they were on the opposite side
heading North between Frenchmans Cove and Hood Point. The distance across the water is greater than two miles at this point, which made it difficult for my wife to get any shots, even with her 600mm lens. But even so, here's a couple of the best she could get, even at that distance. -Paul Nelson Jr
*

10:00 a.m. - Passed Ayock Point heading north
. -Jourdan Bates
*

8:30 a.m. - Orca sighting on Hood Canal
. Saw at least four Orcas n
ear the public dock in Hoodsport
. Playing. -Kenneth Conrad
*

8:30 a.m. - Group of 4-5 spotted near western shore of Hood Canal between Potlatch and Hoodsport
headed north just before opening of shrimping season 2016...so many boats around. Some splashing and feeding, but mostly in direct transit north. One large male, several smaller females. -Daniel Nye
*

6:15 a.m. - We saw 6-7 orcas
, three adult size orcas (one male very large) and three dolphin size babies,
three miles west of Twanoh State Park/boat launch in Hood Canal
. Heading northwest. Playing with three small babies. Very small. Please note that is opening day for Hood Canal shrimping and boat traffic will be very high in the area today. -Mike Sly
*

10:00 a.m. -Whale sighting off the coast of Oregon. 4-5 orcas (possible male as one bigger than the others). North end of Heceta Bank
44

48.721'W. Birds and seals were feeding on a bait ball. Then the Orca's showed up and were eating the bait. Some of the seals left immediately. When the bait was gone the whale turned their attention to the seals. Most of the seals were able to get away except of a group of 25. These the Orca's seemed to be teaching the baby's (2) how to herd the seals into a tight ball. Then one of the adults would come out of the water and land on them. Then the seals would run and it would start all over. We didn't see the whale eat or bite any seals. There was no blood in the water. We were about 1/2 miles away halibut fishing. -Larry Smith
*
Received a call this morning from Dane Monell reporting a sighting of
two killer whales attacking a gray whale calf off Bodega Bay CA
. He was fishing off Carmet when he saw the gray whales and the orca predation. He has video of the event.
*

1:09 p.m. - With a large gray whale moving north at Camano Head
. -Peter Hanke
*
Spent part of the evening on the water with my family & the
humpback Split Fin BCZ0298 (2006 calf of Big Mama BCY0324) at Eastern Bank around
6:00p.m
. -Rachel Haight
