Orca Sightings for May 4, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:16 p.m. - Gray whale 723 heading toward Gedney Island
. -Michael Colahan
*
Captain announced
a couple Grays off the starboard bow side of the
12:30 ferry out of Mukilteo
. Couldn't see them as they had submerged. -Ginger Miller, Possession Shores
*
We had the good fortune of hanging out with a couple of
Humpback whales! This is BCY0160 "Heather"
. The wall you see in the background is Monarch head on Saturna Island, BC. -Traci Walter
*
I watched this
pod of 6 kill a sealion
. This individual mostly hung out, with occasional tail slaps while the smaller whales beat the sealion to death. Teaching the young orcas to kill a sealion. One large, and possibly another small male....They moved off northward with the body, which may have still been alive, but when I re-acquired them at
Malaspina Galleries
, I didn't see it any more. I did see the body drift past my location
(McConvey Rd, Gabriola, BC
) an hour or so later. (
The answer from Dave Ellifrit at the Center for Whale Research is:
T19B in the first pic and T19C with the long scar
on his back in the second
.) -Alan Daley, Gabriola, BC
