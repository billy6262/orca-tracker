Orca Sightings for May 31, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sailed South onto glassy waters
south of Lopez Island
and changed course for Hein Bank with news of transient orcas. We sailed back towards Lopez with the
T46Bs
alongside as the sun was setting. -Barbara Bender, All Aboard Sailing
*

2:00 p.m. - A group of Orcas in Port Angeles
, they seemed like they were fishing. I tried to get picture of them, but they weren't surfacing...was able to see dorsal fins of about 5 or 6. It was around
2:00pm they came in and circled around the harbor starting by the Coast Guard station and down to the mill where they lingered for sometime and then back out. I am not to familiar with the area I was on the spit though. My first time actually seeing them in the wild. I was so excited. I guess they were traveling north, Iost site of them on the other side of the harbor behind an anchored ship. They seemed to be diving deeply, as they were heading out. -Kathleen Barker

a humpback:

SE towards Nisqually

Just drove across the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge
and saw blows beneath can someone please confirm if there is a whale there? -Beverly Varela
