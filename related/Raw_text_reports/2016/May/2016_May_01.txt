Orca Sightings for May 1, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:15 p.m. - 4 orcas
. I was out paddle boarding on
Bellingham Bay
and was surprised by a pod of whales. They appeared to be casually traveling. I was paddle boarding, they surfaced near me (about 15-20 yards away). There was a young whale, 2 medium sized, and 1 large female. They seemed curious of me and were surfacing nearby. A powerboat approached approximately 200 yards away and they headed south. I then observed them approach a slow moving sailboat and surface near it. It appeared as if they were showing instructing the small whale. -Sam Stoner

Elsa Leavitt of Bush Pt, SW Whidbey Island, reported
a single whale: I think a minke
