11:30 a.m. -
When I left them at
11:30'ish (5/7), they were heading north. Their pattern for the last two days was passing Hoodsport around
8:30 a.m. heading north. When the orcas were in in the early 2000's, they had a predictable pattern - working north with an outgoing tide. I never figured out their return pattern....A beautiful morning for watching Orcas swimming North, with the out going tide in Hood Canal... -Harry Louch

11: 38 a.m. - ORCAS just passed the Jorsted Creek
area, on the east side of the Canal heading northbound toward Holly, AWESOME! -Tamara Cihak

11:20 a.m. - Just saw the Hood Canal orcas passing Ayock Point heading north
. -Jourdan Bates

10:00 a.m. - At least 3 Orca Whales
were sighted by many tourists in the lovely town of
Hoodsport,WA
on the Hood Canal,located 28 miles North of Olympia. -Lucy

9:30 a.m. - Transients in hood canal heading toward Dewatto
.. They are being harassed by a fishing boat, can't identify from my location. Repeatedly passing the pod within 50 feet and stopping in their direct path. -Cara Alferness
*

9:00-
9:25 a.m. - Saw a pod of at least 4 orcas in Hood Canal 2 miles north of Hoodsport
traveling north this morning from about 9 til
9:25 am. They were on the Kitsap Peninsula side of the canal. Traveling slowly, slapping flukes on water. Unfortunately there was a motor boat in the midst of them (but it's motor was off) and it was just floating. -Beth Rose
*

9:05 a.m. -
I have spotted
at least 3 orcas, maybe 4 ( possibly one male) in lower hood canal
yesterday
May 6 and again this morning
May 7. Currently they are
on the Tahuya shore north of Hoodsport
heading North. It seems there are maybe two young ones. Traveling, playing, tail slapping. This is the second day in this area....There seems to be a plane up doing a fly over. -Cynthia Sund
*

8:30 a.m. - I saw five and maybe six Orcas in Hood Canal
. They were traveling North, on the East side of the Canal, just before Hoodsport. At
Ayock Beach
, two hours later, (
10:30) I saw one large male way ahead of five orcas all heading North. I gave up at Hama Hama River. There were two large ones, (males?), for sure, then two "normal" size and two juveniles. The best sighting was a
Lilliwaup Tide Flats parking area around 10 a.m
. just north of the Lilliwaup River. At this point they broke from their normal northward travel and turned toward shore, (west). Here the five started circling really close to shore in 10 to 12 feet of water for about 3 - 4 minutes. Close enough that you could hear their blows and see their movement under water. Amazing! No seals, fish or octopus seen. Then they just started swimming north again. A lot of people observed the Orcas as they traveled north. One car would pull over and 10 would follow. A great day for whale watching on Hood Canal. -Harry Louch

A couple of visitors just came into Langley Whale Center and said they saw
whales on the
10:00 Mukilteo crossing
. A pic from their phone looked like a gray whale. It was south of ferry lane by Clinton docks. -Debbie Stewart, LWC docent
