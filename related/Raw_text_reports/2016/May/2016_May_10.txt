Orca Sightings for May 10, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
T100, 100C, 100E, and 100F
made a stealth appearance at
Lime Kiln about
6:45pm
as some harbor porpoises and sea lions were feeding. No attacks noted. This was supposedly a different group than the group of Ts that initially passed by and were tracked down by CWR. About 75 yards offshore. -Ariel Yseth

5:34 p.m. - A gray whale close to Camano shores
is milling around by Pebble Beach. It's swimming close to the surface and diving occasionally. A very distinctive white patch is on its tail. -Sarah Malmstead
*
9am-10am - Grey Whale encounter today off east side of Whidbey Island at Bells Beach
in Saratoga Passage. We had a grey whale come by feeding on the ghost shrimp close to shore while we were out in our kayaks. It was rolling and showing us its pectoral fins and staying in shallow water to feed. It came within 40 fee of our kayaks while it was feeding. What an incredible experience. We were not able to get any pictures up close as we were focused on staying out of it's way and we were not able to identify it as it was too shallow to dive and show us its fluke. I will never forget this unexpected gift. In gratitude. -Kristin Carlson
