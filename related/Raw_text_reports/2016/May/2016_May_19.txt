My husband spotted a whale (he
thinks a gray) heading north on Case inlet past McMicken Island
. Couldn't see if there were others. Anyone else see it. All the neighbors along the beach watched quite a while. Last dive under water was by McMicken and we didn't see it surface again. (Unconfirmed gray, possibly the humpback that was seen the next day in Hammersley Inlet). -Patsy Glaser Gibson
