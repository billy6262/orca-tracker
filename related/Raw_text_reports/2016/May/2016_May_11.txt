Orca Sightings for May 11, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Afternoon to sunset sail. We went north and into Haro Strait to find
Big Mama humpback and her calf ambling towards Turn Point
. We left them to double back toward
Battleship Island to meet the transient orca family, the T123's
. They stopped for supper north of O'Neal Island but supper got away from them. Luckily our supper was cooking in the barbecue. They crossed the channel, slipped around Jones Island and rode the flood up Presidents Channel through the sunset. It was a beautiful evening.

Coastal Grays - Grays breaching just off the beach at La Push
early this morning, on the filling tide. Right in front of the cabins this morning we were greeted with
four groups of grays
. One appeared to be younger and playful, and kept breaching just off the beach. Amazing to be in the presence of these creatures. -Mike Poor
