9 February update
- On our last update on 31 January,
K33 and likely the rest of K pod were off the entrance to the Columbia River.
Over the next five days they made several north--south excursions in the coastal waters
between Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor
. On the morning of 6 February they began a dedicated trip north and on
the morning of the 7th were in the west entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. The whales spent about a day in the central Strait of Juan de Fuca before heading back to the west. As of this morning
(9 February) they were near La Push
on the outer Washington coast. -Map courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging

After receiving reports from Sandy Buckley and others of a small group of whales moving down the west side of San Juan Island in the morning, Dave, Giles, and Cindy met at Snug Harbor and left aboard Orca at 1020. Orca headed down to Salmon Bank and stopped to scan with binoculars. We turned off the engine and immediately heard a blow and soon
found the whales just a little southeast of the Salmon Bank buoy....and on the north end of Long Island (south end of Lopez Island). The T60's along with T2B
were feeding on something that they had killed prior to our arrival.... -Excerpted from Center for Whale Research Encounter no. 10.
