Orca Sightings for February 16, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - 16 February update - As of the last update
on the morning of 9 February K33 and the rest of K pod were near La Push
on the outer Washington coast heading south. By the
evening of the 10th they were off the entrance to the Columbia River
, where they turned north. They gradually continued north reaching the
Quinault Canyon area off the Washington coast on the 13th
. Here they turned south again such that by the
morning of the 15th they were off Willipa Bay
. As of
this morning (16th) they were off the mouth of the Columbia River
. We are hopeful that K33's tag continues to remain attached into the near future as the NWFSC cruise on the NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada to locate and follow the whales during their winter coastal movements is scheduled to get underway 20 February. -Courtesy of Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging
