Orca Sightings for February 17, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
- between the Columbia River and Westport. After three sweeps through that area with no detections we headed up the Washington coast Monday night in the nearshore waters. As we neared
LaPush
this morning, with 25 knots of wind howling out of the east, we saw numerous small blows close to shore heading south. About an hour later we were able close on the whales and confirm that we were with
members of L pod
. The wind subsided about noon allowing us to launch our research boat from the Shimada.
About 1400 we were able to deploy a tag on adult male L95
- (see attached photo). The whales have moved offshore this evening - near the head of the Quinault Canyon (see map). We are hoping for a tag attachment duration that allows us track L pod for the rest of the cruise to gain insights about not only their movements but also their behavior in their coastal winter range. -Brad Hanson, NOAA-NWFS 2016 Southern Resident killer whale satellite tagging.

Whale in Port Angeles Harbor
: Large whale sighted close to downtown waterfront in Port Angeles Harbor, second hand siting, was told to me by a reliable source who observed whale. Much larger than orcas, not sure what kind. Whale surfaced briefly, and at least three people saw enough to know it was quite large. -Eric Neurath
*

4:23 p.m. - Small whale headed north toward Zittles Marina in south sound- JOHNSON Point
. We think maybe Minke? -- solo, moving slowly. (Good chance it's a humpback that has been seen for several days around the Nisqually Reach area). -Robin Matthews

Entry 2:
"Sarataoga" grays have arrived. Here is the underside flukeof #723 while on a dive just off Possession Point
, south Whidbey Island in the afternoon. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

UPDATE -- we heard back that the
possibly entangled humpback
was traveling NORTH - so those of you onshore north of Edmonds & in the Mukilteo/Clinton area please keep your eyes on the water for a whale trailing an orange buoy. (Humpback not seen again, see Intro summary for more details)
*

10:38 a.m. -
Taking train
south from Edmonds
. Looks like a humpback close to shore dragging what looks like a crab pot bouy. Wednesday 2/17
10:30am. Can anyone assist? -Paula 'Skippy' Purcell
*

10:35 a.m. - Whale fouled in crab pot. Just offshore between Edmonds and Mukilteo
. Looks like it is caught up in crab pot gear with orange buoy. -Richard Purcell
*
Approx
2:00 p.m
. - Stu and I launched from Edmonds marina to search for the reported entangled humpback. We decided to check out the blows we had seen earlier off Scatchet Head to rule out that whale. We reached the spot of the last blow with no luck so headed northwest towards Useless Bay and could not find the whale. We doubled back and just as we were
off Cultus Bay about
2:50 p.m. I spotted a whale off Possession Point
. We slowly made our way over to confirm it was a gray whale. We watched it surface and fluke several times back and forth.
By
3:30 the gray was northbound just east of Possession . Pt. Buoy Whidbey
. This whale was not entangled and from video and Stu's photos confirmed this as one of the returning grays, #723. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

1:18 p.m. -
the whale blows I'm seeing are just west of the long row of waterfront homes on
South East Scatchet
.

1:16 p.m. -
just spotted a blow just off of Scatchet Head Whidbey island. -Stu Davidson
Gray whale #723
*

9:45 a.m. -
Lynn Malecki called to report
either a gray whale or a humpback off Columbia Beach,
near the Clinton ferry dock on Whidbey Island, in mid-channel, heading south.
