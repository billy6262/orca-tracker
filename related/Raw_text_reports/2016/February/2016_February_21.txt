Orca Sightings for February 21, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:25 p.m. -
A sighting of very small fluke of what looks to be whale at
Devils Head - South Sound (Anderson Island/Key Peninsula)
Looked like it was alone. We could not see it going toward Johnson Point, so guessing it went back toward north side of Anderson Island. Very eye catching activity of water disruption and then fluke - over and over. -Robin Matthews
(
unconfirmed species, but we've had several humpback sightings in the south Sound the past weeks
)
