1455, he began an encounter with the T's (Bigg's ecotype killer whales) a mile south southeast of Kelp Reef i
n gray choppy seas. When Mark first spotted the whales they were travelling north in a group, but they soon commenced long dives (9 minutes) and changed direction each surfacing as if hunting for seals. That is the situation when Ken began the encounter as Mark left to return to Victoria harbor. Read the full report at Center for Whale Research Encounter #6, including short video in Haro Strait of 8 Transients, the T30s and T124As, although one, T30, didn't make an appearance. It's also a teaching video, on how to make IDs. -Ken Balcomb, CWR

8:40 a.m. - Humpback sighting Alki Pt.
Observed one (possibly two) humpback whales - 2016, Constellation Park, just south of Alki Point Lighthouse.
100 meters offshore
(very high tide, so very close to bulkhead, among substantial floating driftwood, right about at the low tide line), southbound. Several surfaces and blows, then "deep" dive (fluke, but in very shallow water). No obvious feeding activity, no obvious bait-ball in vicinity but some shore birds floating in general area. -Robert Reeder
