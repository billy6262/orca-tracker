Orca Sightings for January 2, 2016
============================================================

Entry 1:
J28 and her new weeks-old calf J54 westbound south of Victoria. J26 headed southwest for Discovery Island.
-Mark Malleson
*
...The
J28's including J54 were in a tight group while J35 and probably J47
were loosely spread another couple of hundred yards to the northeast of them. The J22's were a couple hundred yards ahead of the J28's and all three of the groups were traveling slowly southwest. We ended the encounter at
1528 with the J28's
just a little south of Discovery Island....- Center for Whale Research staff

A few moments before our sailing yesterday, we got the word! Vocalizations on the hydrophones! Within a few minutes we were seeing members of
J Pod and the K14s
. We followed them
to Discovery Island, BC
, over near Victoria. Here are a few scenes from the day, including the lovely Granny, J

3:17 p.m. -
Hearing faint
calls again on Lime Kiln Hydrophone
. -Connie Bickerton
*

1:00 p.m. -
still hearing them on
Lime Kiln
...on the quiet side.

11:50 a.m. - Southern Residents live on the hydrophones: Louder on OrcaSound
(so is the ship noise) Faint intermittent vocals on Lime Kiln (ship noise increasing there). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

What an incredible surprise this morning! I had been listening to the hyrophones as I usually do, and had been switching between two of them. I switched back to the one on the north end of San Juan Island and instantly there were
LOUD J Pod calls
! I ran down to the bluff to look, and here they came! First whale I saw that came in closer to the island was
J
2, Granny. (She's in the photo) They were spread out across the strait and in several groups. ... If you'd like to listen to the recording from this morning I made, click HERE. Jeanne Hyde identified the
K14's
in the mix, so you may hear some K Pod calls too! -Traci Walter

(
This report was passed along to us by Susan Marie Andersson, of a humpback in the Tacoma area on Saturday afternoon
)
There was a
humpback under the Tacoma Narrows this afternoon around
3:00 p.m.
I was walking the beach and saw the hump in the water. Someone else saw it breach! -Reported by Peggy Mohn Murphy
*
Humpback sounding near Point No Point
, Kitsap.

1:45 p.m. - Humpbacks south of Point No Point
near Kitsap side. -Steve Smith
(
This humpback with distinct fluke markings has been photo ID's in this area regularly since
September 2015
)
*

2:38 p.m. -
few minutes of blows from
at least 2 whales west side the Sound between Point No Point and Eglon
. Maybe trending southbound but really they just beauties shuffling north and south all these days. Gorgeous day. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

11:58 a.m. -
Can see whale blows mid point between
Pt no Pt and Eglon from north Edmonds
. -Stu Davidson
*

11:50 a.m. -
Michelle Moyer reports
two whales south of Point No Point
. (Probably humpbacks based on location and blows seen in distant photo)
*
I saw them earlier around

11:00 a.m
. northward from
Eglon
, then southward from
Point No Point.
Back in Eglon I watched for them but didn't find them. Elusive today - I suspect they are hugging the shore close to the Kitsap side in between, just north of Pilot Point, according to triangulation on a map. -Casey Burns
