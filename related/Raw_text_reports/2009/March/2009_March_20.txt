I live on Colvos Passage at Point Richmond in Pierce County, WA (we look across the passage to
Vashon Island
). Our house is just N of #6 Marine Marker. I saw what I am almost certain was a
gray whale
traveling South in Colvos Passage toward Delco Wall at approximately

3:50 p.m
. Whale was traveling - coming up to blow every 2+ mins. Whale's body was visible only once from my vantage point. No fins or tail visible.

I did venture out at
2.15 pm
and you would not have believed the sudden change in the weather in five minutes. The wind changed directions and we were hit by a squall with 6-7 ft seas, but we did see
J pod
and one of the new calves for five minutes, then it was head back to the safety of the Victoria Harbour. The Orca were motoring real fast as they headed out west.

Mark Malleson of Victoria called to report
J pod
spread out off
Victoria
, heading west at

11:50 am
.

We received a call from Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales, reporting
orca calls
on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
at

10:50 am
.
*
1044 am
- Hearing calls on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
amongst other loud noise.

Hearing calls on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
at

10:43 am
. Interesting the sound difference in the 2 links, one called Orcasound and one called Lime Kiln - Very strong boat noise on Orcasound, but LimeKiln can hear the calls. It's cool to be able to figure out which direction the boats (and whales!) are going.
