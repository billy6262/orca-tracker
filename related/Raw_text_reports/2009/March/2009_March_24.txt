The Island Explorer 3 ventured up into
Port Susan
this morning (around

11:45
) where we found
4 Gray Whales
(#49- our old friend Patch, #22, #383, & #723)!! When we first arrived the 4 were swimming fairly close to one another, then Patch made a sharp change in direction heading southward toward the north end of Gedney Island. The other 3 whales moved towards the mainland shoreline where they proceeded into 10 ft of water! We watched in awe as they rolled to their side sending a pectoral fin high in the air and half of their fluke breaking the surface! Eventurally they peeled off the shallow bank heading upwind of us, giving our guests a whiff of their stale breath!

NINE Gray Whales ID'd in Northern Puget Sound
I wanted to provide a quick update on the identification of gray whales in the northern Puget Sound area. This has been a very good season with whales showing up earlier than normal and a higher number of different individuals identified early in the season than has generally been the case. Thanks to assistance of Island Adventures that have hosted some of our researchers, and photographs submitted to us by several people, we have confirmed 9 different identified gray whales in the region in the last month (starting 23 February). These include ID # 21, 22, 44, 49, 53, 56, 383, 531, and one new individual. The first 6 of these represent whales first identified in 1991 and 1992 in our first effort in this region.
We have had some reports of some possible additional individuals present but have not received photographs to confirm this. At present 8 of the 10 individuals listed in our photo-ID guide available on our web site have been confirmed present.
We continue to welcome receiving any identification photographs of individuals especially if you think you have seen an animal not on the above list. Best, John Calambokidis, Research Biologist, Cascadia Research Calambokidis@cascadiaresearch.org
Thanks to all who have submitted photographs of gray whales this season, and to Island Adventures for their great reports, and Cascadia Research for the update on ID's. Keep 'em coming!
