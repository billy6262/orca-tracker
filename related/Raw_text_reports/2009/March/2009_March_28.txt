Orca Sightings for March 28, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went back in the Strait of Juan de Fuca to get out of high winds on outer coast that came up in afternoon. Although we were able to stay with
Ls
acoustically into early morning hours their calls were only intermittent and then we started to also pick up calls from transients. Shortly thereafter all we had were transient calls and visually located a large group
Ts
- about 30 - in the
Pt Grenville area
(No. of Moclips). We stayed with them for a couple of hours. Preliminary IDs from Dave and Candi include
T74, T36s, T36b (with a new calf), T50, T63, T65, T65b, T68s, T73, T73c,d,CA195, T99with 3 kids
.

At about
3 pm
while walking the dog above
Hidden Beach (N. Greenbank)
I saw a
gray whale
moving north up Saratoga Passage. It blew nine times then fluked as it turned in toward Whidbey. About ten minutes later it appeared to be feeding along the shore just north of Hidden Beach.

For the last 2 days what appears to be a cow and a calf
gray whales
have been feeding about 500 yd off shore between
Deception Pass and Rocky Point
. One big blow with flukes and one very small blow side by side.
