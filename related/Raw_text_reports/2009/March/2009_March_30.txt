I'm watching at least
4 gray whales
in
Saratoga Passage
, feeding off the west side of Camano Island between Elger Bay and Mabana, from

5:25-6 pm
. They were initially heading north, but now appear to be heading back south.
Update at

6:40 pm:
They must have turned back north again, because now I'm seeing spouts just N. of Lowell Pt, off
Camano Island
State Park.

4:30 to 5 PM
.
FOUR gray whales
working their way north to Mabana! 3 together along the drop-off, one of which was much smaller, swimming close to a larger one, and often breathing together. The fourth was in a little shallower and seemed to be exhaling just under the surface.
