Last night at

7:20 to
7:35 PM
we watched
three gray whales
feed in the shallow water NW of
Langley
. The whales were feeding right next to each other literally belly to back, rolling against each other (do you think this is social behavior or does it help them feed? Maybe a combination?) as they worked their way SE to Langley.

5 gray whales
are headed east toward Langley.

2:25 pm.
L pod
off the
Columbia River plume
. We detected them acoustically first... it was very exciting to find them. We lost them again last night since they were quiet during our last visual sight and traveling south along the 20 fathom line pretty much for most of the afternoon (3/26). We had to go deeper after dark because of all the fishing gear out here. We continued south to overshoot where we thought they might be by morning and then did tracklines back up north. The visual team found them again off the Columbia R plume this afternoon (

14:25
). The crew just deployed the small boat and the whales are grouped up, resting and haven't made a peep so far. Our current lat/long is 046deg 21'51.5460"N, 124deg 41'411.3200"W.

.
