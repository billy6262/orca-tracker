Orca Sightings for March 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit encountered
J pod
spread out in subgroups off
False Bay, San Juan Island
during the mid-day, and traveled north to the vicinity of D'Arcy Island, British Columbia by sunset. Both new babies, J44 and J45, were with their respective mothers and looking healthy. J1 posed nicely in front of Mt Baker - two Icons of the Pacific Northwest.

Veronica von Allworden reported
2 or 3 gray whales
out by

about Â½ a mile west of Camano Head, from
5 -
5:30 pm
. They've been diving deep and headed southeast for a while and then they turned and headed back to the northwest in your direction; and 2 grays feeding up close to shore, heading into deeper water and south toward
Langley
at

7:15 pm
.

Sandy Dubpernell relayed a report from Marsha Berquist at

6:41 pm
from Fisherman's Alibi (next to
Dines Point
) about a
[gray] whale
of some sort that kids had spotted and thought there was a problem -like it was trying to beach itself. Marsha looked and saw two whales not that close to shore, but in fairly shallow water. They were making sounds and fussing around in the water.
Often when the grays feed, they are very close to shore, and look like they might be stranded - but they are usually just feeding in the shallow water, often with their pectoral fins, fluke tips, and sometimes their sides exposed above the water - sb

At

6:30pm
my daughters (Shelbie, Madelyn, and Ava) and I spotted a grey whale out in front of our house.(
Greenbank
, off of Dines Point) We watched him swim around, he was possibly feeding. He was still there as the sun was setting and we could no longer see him. We could still hear him though.

I'd been listening to OrcaSound all day, nothing - just got Jeanne's message & switched to
Lime Kiln
& there are all kinds of orca calls at

4:40 pm
! UPDATE - calls now (

5:10 pm
) on the
OrcaSound
hydrophone - they're definitely heading north.

Finally got to see what I was hearing the other night. A
(gray) WHALE
It didn't really surface too much but I could see the blow hole in action. Was out here on the
Greenbank
shores this morning at about
10:30 or so.
