Orca Sightings for January 23, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

4:00pm
we had multiple small
groups of orcas
passing by Trial Island: 5 or
6 groups of 3-6 orcas each
.It took more than half an hour for them all to pass by. They came round the south tip of Trial Island Lighthouse, moving eastward in the Juan de Fuca Strait then turning north towards Bayne's Channel.

I was out yesterday fishing and happened to have my camera with me. Hopefully you will be able to identify
this pod
(see photo). What a spectacular sighting and a spectacular day.

I have just got in from
Clover Point Victoria
and watched many
ORCA
travelling in from the west and heading your way. I counted
24 at least
although they were far out and travelling fast
east
. This may be J pod ...too far out to ID. Big male in the lead three animals. I feel so blessed to have looked up at the right moment. I did see the whales spy hopping, cartwheeling and tail slapping. Definitely the residents.

We spent a nice afternoon today with the
northern resident A8 matriline
(part of A5 pod) near
Pender Harbour on the BC Sunshine Coast (north of Vancouver BC)
.
