Orca Sightings for April 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Since my last report on
April 9th we continue to see the
[gray] whale
daily (in
Holmes Harbor
) still feeding in the same areas and moving in the same patterns. We do see the side fin and fluke and yes the water seems muddier where he is moving around. We also notice many scoters in the area when he is feeding. The wind was blowing and the harbor stirred up, he was 50 to 75 feet from shore on the south end of Beverly Beach and moving in that same back and forth fashion. We were able to witness how quickly he can reverse direction, moving sharply through the water. In the photos we were able to note what looked likes cuts or bites out of each fin - we would be curious to know what you learn from the photos.

And from Cascadia Research, in response to the photos submitted by Trisha: It does look like that animal survived a fairly recent attack. It does not match any of the other recent "new" whales we have pictures of (in N. Puget Sound). There is a possibility it is a match to a whale that has been seen in previous years on the outer coast (minus the new wounds on the dorsal surface of the body), however due to the image quality and major changes, we are not going to confirm the match without additional better quality images. Thanks for sending these images, and feel free to keep additional IDs coming, as there seem to be a few mystery whales out there this year!

The waters were really rough this weekend but, we saw a number of baby greys off
LaPush, WA
. Mom's were staying outside of the cove at 1st Beach while the calves played.

1 [gray] Whale
at Port Blakely,
Bainbridge Island
, WA (Latitude: 47°35'19.67"N; Longitude:122°29'25.20"W), between
3pm and 4pm
, observed very close to shore at low tide. The whale was about 25 to 30 feet from shore. The animal made repeated oval passes over the area staying submerged 3 to 4 minutes at a pass.

Saw

Mabana
boat launch.

We were lucky to have the opportunity to view a group of
five transients
in the
Swartz Bay BC
area. They where very actively feeding and we witnessed at least five different kills. Seals and one unfortunate river otter. Then for about a half an hour the whale appeared to take a break from feeding to rub themselves against some rock and play in the current.

We saw 3-4
Orcas
swimming around our ferry at Schwartz Bay this afternoon at exactly
3 pm
. They proceeded to swim extremely close to the shoreline and our ferry was delayed to ensure their safety. It looked like a juvenile Orca was with this "mini-pod" which created quite a stir among the passengers. They stayed for a few minutes and then took off swimming in a northerly direction.

Robert Moore called to report
2 grays
in
Holmes Harbor
- what looked like a Mom (40'-45') & calf (20'-25') about 200 yards off his dock in Greenbank (across from Greenbank store), appeared to be heading NE toward Baby Island.
