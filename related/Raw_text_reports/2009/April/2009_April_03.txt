Heard blows (from possibly
2 [gray] whales)
from Bell's Beach (Saratoga Passage, N. of
Langley
) where we are staying at a B&B. The blows were hard to determine how far out, but I surmise they were around mid-channel toward Camano. We listened for about 40 mins to the occasional blows in the still moonlit night. They were heading south slowly.

At about

9:45pm
I heard the blows of what sounded like a single
[gray] whale
feeding along the shoreline below (
Langley
). The gray whale lingered 10-15 minutes - sounding like just one whale, not two, but I couldn't be sure. Earlier tonight, about

5:30pm
, two
gray whales
were feeding at the bottom of our yard. This time they seemed to be taking their time, swimming their tight circles and feeding leisurely. That's not typically been the case this year for our location. in past weeks they seem to skuttle by. But when the tide goes out there's an abundance of divets, so I guess they are feeding. Veronica, our good neighbor whale-spotter, had left a message that they were here at 4pm (see report below), so that would have them here for more than an hour - west end of First St in Langley.

At about

4:00 PM
a gray whale, #531
, came by feeding in the shallow water. It headed to
Langley
and then turned and went back to the NW. While we were watching a motorboat came very close to the whale. The whale had just dipped under water when the boat passed. At
5:40 the gray whale was back heading SE and continued to feed. The whale turned and headed back to the NW again at

6:15
.

.

Jeff LaMarche called Orca Network at

11:20 am
to report ~
6 Transient orcas
2.5 miles SE of East Sooke Park,
S. Vancouver Island
, taking a Steller Sea Lion. So far, ID's included
4 T30's
,
T172
& possibly T38.
*
At about
11 AM
, While working as Lighthouse Keepers for a week at New Dungeness Spit Lighthouse, Karla Harrison saw a group of
four orcas
in Dungeness Bay at approximately N48.17974 W123.10975 (datum is that used by NASA's Worldwind. I've been trying to find it without success), directly south of the lighthouse and about 100 yards off the beach. They were moving West when first seen, but turned back to the east after rolling, blowing and displaying their dorsal fins several times. Several of us observed them from the lighthouse tower and Karla took the appended pictures with a Canon Powershot 590 camera. I thought they might be useful in identifying the individuals. In the picture with the male's fin showing, the whale in front of him seems to have a white spot near the tip of her fin. They did not appear to be feeding. After turning to the east to leave the bay and blowing three or four times, they were not seen again. Apparently they moved away without surfacing. After the whales left, we saw two groups of harbor seals quite close to shore, and wondered if they were taking refuge from the orcas, but the latter were not seen.

We forwarded the photos sent with this report on to researchers, and heard this back from Mark Malleson: My guess is T14 with the T49A's as they were headed that direction last night. The fin shape is right for T14.

Bob Whitney of Port Townsend called Orca Network with an interesting whale report this afternoon - at
2:30 pm he sighted a
Minke whale
, a
Gray whale
, and
1 female Orca
in Admiralty Inlet, off Pt. Wilson, NW of Port Townsend.
*
At
2 PM
I saw the first
grey whale
of the season in
Case Inlet
(S. Puget Sound). I first spotted it mid-bay off of the north end of Pickering Passage. It worked it's way to about 150 yards offshore, just ½ mile south of Vaughn Bay where he spent some time (about 15 minutes) resting on the surface just off of my mooring buoy in about 45 feet of water.

Kathy Fritts called Orca Network at

10:20 am
to report
2 Gray whales
feeding off North Bluff Rd, just N of
Greenbank
, heading south.
*
Have been watching
a Gray whale
off the bluff on corner of Fort Nugent Road and West Beach (
NW Whidbey Island
). Been around for 2 days (6 and 7th). Blows a lot and seems to be eating in a circle.

. The 1st sighting this year was on
March 10th.

Entry 2:
A small
gray whale
was reported feeding off the south end of the Beverly Beach neighborhood on
Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey Island at

6:30PM
. This was during the lowest tide of the day (-0.1 at

6:19PM
). I have lived in Beverly Beach for almost seven years and this was the first sighting during my time here. I've been told that gray whales used to come into our neighborhood. When I arrived home at
10PM
and got my neighbor's phone message about the whale, I went down onto the beach and walked towards the area where the whale had been seen. I could hear a whale blowing, but the moonlight was not bright enough for me to see it. I listened to it for 30 minutes. It appeared to be slowly traveling south towards Freeland. There is a herring run occurring in Holmes Harbor. It has gotten things stirred up around here. We've had visiting sea lions (as many as six spotted together last week) and gatherings of up to 23 eagles swirling over the water. I've seen the young eagles plop down on the water.

Spotted
a gray whale
at about

6:00 pm
in
Holmes Harbor
at the south end of Beverly Beach. The Whale was very close to shore in the shallow water, leisurely moving through the water and reversing direction every 5 minutes or so. It is now

9:30 pm
- we can tell by the sound of the blows that the whale is in the same general area.

At least
3, possibly 4, grays
in Saratoga. From
7-
7:30PM
. I watched two grays swimming close together going North toward
Mabana Road
. A third gray was a ways apart and behind. Surprisingly, they then all 3 reversed course and went South. Whales, the setting sun, and a perfectly calm evening. It doesn't get much better!

The Island Explorer 3 found
three Grey Whales (#21, #22, & #383)
feeding in the shallow waters surrounding the east side of
Gedney Island
at around

11:30 AM!
They seemed to be enjoying the beautiful blue skies and warm sunshine that glistened off their slow rising backs! We watched as they returned to the "Gedney Island Ghost Shrimp Buffet" 3 times, with short breaks into deeper waters between feedings! Enclosed is a photo (see above) of some residents of Gedney Island also enjoying the wonder of the 3 giants feeding close to shore and each other.
