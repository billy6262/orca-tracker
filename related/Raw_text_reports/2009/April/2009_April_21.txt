I saw my first gray whales in the
Strawberry Point
(Oak Harbor) area as per recent orca network reports of sightings. at
5pm
, I saw only a large spray of mist right onshore at the mouth of mariner's cove, then another. it took several minutes to drive and walk over to get a better view. I, indeed saw a
gray
, then another, both about 100 yards heading offshore towards camano island. I was too late to see them up close, but it was nonetheless a big thrill to watch them periodically blow for 20 minutes as they steadily headed away due east.

5 Gray Whales
in
Boundary Bay
again this
afternoon
. For some time, 3 Grays were swimming side by side. There was also a lone Gray Whale in the Strait of Georgia, north of the coal docks, near the T14 marker. This loner did a lazy spyhop to take a look at our passengers. It's such a gift to have these gentle giants in our area, however briefly.

I saw spouts mid channel heading out of holmes harbor towards
greenbank
. I was unable to confirm species but the spouts looked similar to the
grays
I've been seeing.

Carolyn Mercer of Greenbank called us to relay a sighting of
4-5 orcas
in Holmes Harbor around noon, by her kids who were out kayaking. They saw the big fins and some active behavior, & have seen orcas before and confirmed these were orcas, not porpoise. They first saw them near Baby Island, then down by Dines Pt, still heading south into Holmes Harbor. The family had all been watching from Greenbank at the entrance to Holmes Harbor and had not seen them leave. We looked along the west side of Holmes Harbor, and called folks along the east side to keep a lookout for us, but
didn't see anything
, except a few porpoise off Greenbank at around
2:20 pm.

At

6:15
, while strolling with my toddler on the beach in
Mariner's Cove
, we got lucky and saw
two grays
a couple hundred yards or so offshore. I saw a couple white pectoral flippers come up, so I am assuming they were feeding. They hung around and were still in that general area, right off Strawberry Point, when we left around six forty pm. I hope to see them again soon!
