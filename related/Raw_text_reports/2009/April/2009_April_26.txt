Orca Sightings for April 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
It was a great encounter with the
T49's
(
5 Transient orcas
)on our Ocean Magic trip at
12.15pm
. These animals were confirmed by Mark Malleson. We came across them off Secretary Island,
Sooke, Vancouver Island
. They were frolicking close to shore. They were encountered again on a later trip east and south of Race Rocks. They were very active with tail slaps and spyhops. Beautiful conditions on the water.

So we headed out at
1:00. Then about 45 minutes later came the call and we headed out toward
Victoria
. We encountered a group of
Transient Orcas
.
Capt. Jim and Mrs. Capt. Jim Maya,
Jim Maya's pics are the
T49A's and B's
again. The spyhopper is T49A with her slightly funky jawline.
