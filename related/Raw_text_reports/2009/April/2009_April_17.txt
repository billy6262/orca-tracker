Orca Sightings for April 17, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Off my 2nd story deck facing due North on the West end of First Street,
Langley
, are Gray Whale feeding divets. As the season progresses, these shallow but wide holes increase in number. Between Gedney Island (some call it "Hat") and South Whidbey we saw several
gray whales
, and some flukes. Cap'n Hughes tells us that although the waters are deep there (accounting for the deep-dive flukes), an underground "hill" exists that's only about 150 ft below the surface. The gray whales, he tells us, like to feed off that hill.

Little past

6:30PM
was outside and heard/saw spout off Mariners Cove (NE Whidbey Island). Shortly, afterwards saw
two grays
[about 100 yards apart]. No shrimp feeding but plenty of rolling, along with spouts for about 10 minutes. They got together and headed SW towards Polnell Point. They headed towards Polnell. Generally, travelling 50 to 100 yards off shore. A few places they stopped very briefly and showed fins as if they were feeding on sand shrimp. Perhaps, they were feeding on something other than the shrimp at times. They were not always together. The more I walked with them, the more I realized one gray was really large. Louder/larger spouts, with a deep echo hollow type funnel sound after each spout. The other was smaller, but, not because it was young or a baby gray. The larger one had a really large hump/forehead? that stood out when surfacing. Just north of Polnell, they seemed to be feeding on sand shrimp for awhile. Much of the time, quite a distance apart. Then, both headed back NE heading back up Mariners Cove Way. It was nearly two hours since I had first seen them, when smaller gray disappeared and only the larger gray kept heading towards Mariners Cove. At dark, ended where I had started. In front of our place with only the large gray passing by, heading towards Strawberry Point.
