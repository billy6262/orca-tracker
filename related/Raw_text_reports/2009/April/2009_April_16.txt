Orca Sightings for April 16, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
7 orca
crossing in front of the center (
Depoe Bay, OR
) southbound. They were about 3\4 of a mile off shore and it was

11:00 am
. We did see a lot of breaching in what looks like feeding frenzy as described by Ken. The same that we saw with K&L pods feeding on salmon. We also saw a spyhop at the end of the show. They continued on south bound.

Five grey whales
have been feeding at Crescent Beach,
Boundary Bay B.C
. right along the international border. They arrived on Thursday
April 16th, and have been observed every day since then.

I saw a
gray whale
from the ferry from Mukilteo to
Clinton
during the
6pm
crossing. I did see its tail in the air twice and waterspouts. It was heading north between the island and the mainland.

up through Saratoga Passage.

Fred Lundahl of Langley called to relay gray whale reports from the Edgecliff Restaurant in
Langley
in the
evening
.
*
My parents and neighbors saw at about

6:30PM
, another single
gray
sighting right in front, off Mariners Cove. Same pattern of gray cruising by from NE Strawberry Point direction, towards
SW Polnell Point
. Gray stopped out front for a bit. My parents did not indicate if there was any feeding activity. This is the fourth time since last weekend, of a single gray visiting this area.

Just watched a single
gray
whale pass by Rolling Bay at

6:15pm
on
Bainbridge Island
heading south into Murden Cove where it appears to be feeding.

Fred Lundahl called to report
4 gray whales
off Witter Beach, south of Langley from
6-9 am
. 3 of them were in a tight group, feeding very close to shore, heading south toward Clinton. The 4th was further out - it went out further and came back in, but never joined the other group. At
9:15 am all 4 whales left and headed toward Hat/Gedney Island. At
9:45 am, all 4 returned to Witter Beach, feeding close to shore, the 4th whale still kept some distance from the others.
*
The
gray whale
is here again this morning (

8:50 am
) at the south end of Beverly Beach in Holmes Harbor cruising in his usual fashion.
Trisha Brigham, Beverly Beach
*

6:00am
. One
gray
feeding in the cove just north of Kayak Point until about

6:30
, then headed south.
