My goldens and I were beach walking about 15 minutes out of
Langley
towards Bell's Beach (near the barge) and were able to accompany what appeared to be
three grays
about 1/4 of the way out towards Camano about
5 PM
. Lots of spouting and a few flukes. The feeding patterns seem to be a bit different this year, at least that's what we're seeing. We live right on the beach in Langley and have typically seen whales 100 yards from our bulkhead, no flukes, only at high tide. Now we are seeing whales frequently while walking on the the beach at medium tide. Maybe the ghost shrimp beds are more plentiful further out this year?

At high noon, today a
single gray
was right out in front, slowly cruising past
Mariners Cove
heading SW. 100 yards south, gray stopped to feed. Swirling around, splashing, showing fin/etc. Later, at

1:30PM
, drove by car, to check out bay NE of Polnell Point. Saw spouting and gray going back and forth, possibly feeding on something other than ghost shrimp. No swirling activity. An hour later, leaving car to walk the beach, spotted gray heading back towards Mariners Cove. Then, stop and turn back towards Polnell. At about

3:15 PM
right in front of me, just 75" off shore (however, seemed so much closer) on a perfectly calm day/secluded bay; gray took a nap. From
3:15 to
4:15 PM, gray napped. Totally, stationary, in same place, in shallow water [maybe a couple of feet below surface.] Every 2 minutes or so, rising up to spout and then going straight back down. Then, at

4:15PM
, gray headed out to deeper water and last spout seen was right off Polnell Point, heading in Coupeville direction. The low tide was at approximately

3:32PM
today.
