Orca Sightings for April 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to report he had received a video of ~150 White Sided Dolphins, taken in Sechelt Inlet, B.C. in the
morning
.

One gray
observed in the north end of
Port Susan
off and on throughout the day.

Our
grey
friends graced us with their presence not once, but twice today. We had at least two of them "farming" Elger Bay from
8-9
this morning, and three paid a sunset visit this evening around

7:30
. I find it hard to imagine anything is left out there for them to feed on with all the time they're spending here this year! They were feeding in very close to shore this morning.

My daughter Lilly (12) and I have been beach strolling hoping to see a Gray for more than a month. Today we finally saw
one Gray
off the County access in Greenbank (Wonn Rd). It was headed north about

3:00 pm
.

Right at low tide/at exact tidal change,
between 2PM to
2:15PM
; our neighbor called to inform us of a '
gray
' right out front. Off Mariner's Cove; in really shallow water where water is still brown [from sand] before drop off. Seemed like 'gray' was in too shallow, lot of its back exposed. Obviously, it knows what its doing. Anyway, no swirling. No typical flipper motion when feeding on ghost shrimp. Ever so slowly heading [SW] towards Polnell Point. Definately, feeding where sand meets drop off shelf or deeper water. But, on what? Interestingly, where this occurred, there were no 'feeding pits'. This beach has a sandy beach that goes way out at low tide. Do not think this late lunch/snack had ghost shrimp on the menu. Possible exception that 'gray' could be scooping shrimp/other? along the sand shelf.

At

12:20 PM
one of the whale watch boats was in front of Langley observing
2 gray whales
that were traveling from the NW to the SE. The whales turned and headed back to the NE and the whale watching boat continued east. By
12:45 the whales were very close to shore NW of
Langley
. The tide is way out and I can see the dark line of the eel grass right along the edge of the drop off. The two whales were right in the eel grass. I assume they were feeding. They were moving very slowly and then coming up and raising their heads quite high out of the water (swallowing??). One of the whales was Patch (#49) and the other looked like #531 though I'm not sure about that.

Two gray whales
spouting again, between the
Clinton
Ferry Dock and the
Everett
Marina, at

11:45 am
.

10:15 am:
I glanced out our window just as the heavy rain was easing and thought I saw a log in the water up at the Mabana Road. The "log" finally slipped below the surface, reappeared, then showed its flukes, and didn't appear again. Usually they stay and feed for some time in this area. There was also a flock of Surf Scoter.

Peter DeLuca sent 2 photos of
gray whale
flukes (see above) observed in Elger Bay, Camano Island at
9 am
.

Saw one
gray
this morning at
10
in the same spot, off the beach just 200 yards south of Camano's
Mabana
boat launch.
David Brown, Camano Island
