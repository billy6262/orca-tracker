Orca Sightings for April 7, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just wanted to report that my daughter and I saw a
Gray Whale
in
Holmes Harbor
at about
3 PM
headed toward Freeland at the south end of the harbor.

Sally Mizroch called me yesterday just when we ran into the
Ts
- when it rains it pours - she had phone message from from Neil with the US Coast Guard reporting
5-6 killer whales
off Dungeness at
0950
- N48 10.4 and W123 03.96.
These were likely
T14 & the T49A's
reported by others Tues. morning - sb

The morning departure out of Victoria started out as any other normal wildlife tour, but that all changed at
1115 hrs
. when I lucked out and found a small group of very active Killer Whales a few miles Southwest of Race Rocks Lighthouse. Upon arrival to this very active group of Orcas, I noticed that there was a large Sea Lion in the water with the whales. Whales were ID'd as
T30, T30A, T30B, T30C and T172
, respectively. (did not include the possible T38 included in the last report). Our location at this point was 2.5 nm SW of Church Rk. (Offshore of
East Sooke Park
). The five Transients were lunging and thrashing around frantically at the surface trying to stun or knockout this large Steller Sea Lion. For 25 minutes the five whales continually rammed the poor guy from all directions until the Sea Lion magically caught a huge stroke of luck. Somehow the Steller Sea Lion had managed to drift right into the path of a giant floating kelp bed which he immediately took refuge in. I stayed on scene for as long as possible to see what was going to happen to the Sea Lion. At
1215
, I finally had to leave the area to head back to Victoria to pickup the afternoon trip. As I left the area, the whales were still circling the kelp bed, taunting the Sea Lion. I never did see the final outcome of the encounter and the only two boats that were on scene were Mallard and myself. On the afternoon trip, the five whales had moved well to the East of Race Rocks and were all grouped up in traveling mode doing long dives of 5-8 minutes. We picked the whales up at
1530
hrs. 3.5 nm SE of Race Rocks and left them one hour later at 1635 hrs. headed Southwest 3.9 nm SW of Race Rocks Lighthouse.

I probably reached Crown Park in
Port Angeles
, WA around

5:30pm
. This park overlooks the Strait of Juan de Fuca just west of the Nippon Paper Mill. The whales were just off the west side of the mill, very close to shore (my best guess would be 200 yards?) At the first sighting, I only saw
two Orcas
. It appeared to be a mother and a baby orca. I watched them for about 5 to 10 minutes, they were moving slowly; coming up for air and under again. They were traveling west down Juan de Fuca Strait. I got back in my car and drove further down (probably 2 to 3 miles) the road where I could see them again. Then I saw
4 orcas
. There were possibly 2 females, a baby and a male. The male was huge and had the biggest dorsal fin. The male was white along the dorsal fin, fuzzy white on either side of the "stripe". His dorsal fin maybe, just maybe had been "nicked" along the top, but I thought I saw that on the front edge of the fin (not along the back part). I'm not sure on that. I have been told before by staff at the Nippon Mill that they have seen the Orcas going by. There were two metal fishing boats following the Orcas at a safe distance. It appeared they were taking film or photos of the whales.

This sounds like the same Transient pod sighted off Dungeness yesterday - photos & descriptions from that sighting & a previous report lead researchers to believe this was T14/Pender (the big male) and the T49A's - Sb

From
Point Roberts to Montegue Harbour
about
6 pm
we were blessed to see
2 adult orcas
with a very young baby between them, the baby was very small and had a fairly bright "orange" patch on its side. They seemed to be feeding at the west side of Active Pass circling around the area for about 20 minutes before heading south towards Navy Channel.
