Orca Sightings for April 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas
spotted in Ursua Channel near
Craig, Alaska
. Travelling with a large pod of 4-5 family units with 4-5 in each pod. This one (w/curved fin) was travelling with a slightly smaller orca. Can you identify and let me know who this is?

These animals are most definitely offshores. Although the photo quality is not great I believe I can id O183 (male with bent over fin) and O246. I was able to identify another animal, O175.

Mark Malleson's 10 am Zodiac trip caught up with the big group of
Transients
near
Swartz Bay
today. He encountered the same ones reported yesterday, 9th April. I saw three big males
T14, T30A and T11A
along with many females. Great day seeing all those Transients together.

Orca Network received a call from Rob Lawson of
Powell River, B.C
, reporting
3 orcas
in Malaspina Strait at

12:45 pm
today. There was a male, female & young calf - the male had a vertical white line on his fin (more description below). They were in the N. end of Malaspina Strait, heading SE. He then sent this update: The male is not in the photo groups (ID Guide), very big, vertical white strip on dorsal fin is about 1/3 to 2/3 of the ways to the top. Cute baby, very small, must be this years?? thanx from the best coast,

From

4:45-
5:15pm
we saw one
grey whale
feeding off of the eastern shore of north
Holmes Harbour
near the Saratoga Beach neighborhood on Whidbey Island. He would come up to breathe every three minutes or so and we could see his back and watch him spout from his blow hole. He was leisurely heading North toward Baby Island.

I saw a few
Gray whales
between Beverly Beach and Saratoga Beach on the east side of
Holmes Harbor
. They were feeding back and forth in the crabgrass (80feet deep) and then headed North towards baby Island along the shore / dropoff at
3:45. (The Herring roe is stuck to everything on our beach at mid tide and I'm assuming the Grays are here feeding on it and or the Herring).

Gray whale
feeding, rolling, showing flukes when diving, on a line between
Langley
Marina and the southern tip of Camano Island, at
1:05 pm.

At
11:15 I watched
3 gray whales
swimming mid channel (closer to the Camano side) between Langley and Camano Island. The whales were headed to the SE (Camano Head). They approached and passed a sailboat that was slowly motoring along- much to the delight of the two sailors on board! and an update: At

12:45
a single gray whale swam by, just past the drop off (it is low tide) traveling from NW to SE. It did a deep dive and I got a good look at its knuckles and fluke. It looks like #531.

Roxy Etherton of Greenbank called at

10:20 am
to report
1 gray whale
off North Bluff Rd, heading south toward Hidden Beach.
*
There were
3 Greys
in
Elger Bay
feeding and surfacing together (gave us a good look at their size). Spotted them at about

7:30
this morning. Not sure when they arrived, but they appeared to be gone by just before 8 a.m.
