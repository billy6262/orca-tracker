Orca Sightings for April 28, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today reports first came in around
11.30am
of
Transient Orcas
near Sheringham Lighthouse. We headed out on a
2pm
trip and caught up with the
5 Transient Orcas
just North of
Race Rocks
. The Orcas were later identified as the T49's by Ron Bates, MMRG. Whilst we observed the T49's we did see signs of a kill underwater and the Orcas milling around after the kill.

Transient killer whales T20 and T21
and 7 other small fins (T23's?) came through
Seymour Narrow's
on a big ebb tide yesterday (4/28) and swam past
Campbell River
at about
5pm
southbound. A "huge" Humpback whale spent some time at Chatham Pt. making some very long deep dives.
