Orca Sightings for April 8, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
greys
have been VERY active in
Elger Bay
on Camano Island over the past several days. I photographed a pair of them yesterday
evening
as they fed for nearly 3 hours. They returned this morning to continue the buffet. This appears to be the most grey whale activity in the bay in several years. The birds are really loving the aftermath of their forays

We had a group of
5 Transients
off the northern coast of Washington - 1 adult male, 2 females and 2 juveniles - Candi and Dave are not sure of the ID of these yet. We were able to satellite tag one these whales and will have updates on the location on the Cascadia website soon. We returned to Seattle this morning. Also Sally Mizroch called me yesterday just when we ran into the Ts - when it rains it pours - she had phone message from Tuesday morning (4/7) from Neil with the US Coast Guard reporting
5-6 killer whales
off Dungeness at
0950
- N48 10.4 and W123 03.96.
These were likely
T14 & the T49A's
reported by others Tues. morning - sb

I observed
a gray whale
feeding off the south point of Beverly Beach in
Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey Island between

6:15 and
6:45PM
. Each time the whale surfaced to blow I could see its back. The whale was going slowly back and forth (North and South). Based on a buoy anchored at the edge of the eel grass (where the flat, shallow bottom drops off into deeper waters), the whale appeared to be interested in something (maybe the herring run) at the edge of the eel grass.
