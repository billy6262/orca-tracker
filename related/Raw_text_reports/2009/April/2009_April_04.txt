Orca Sightings for April 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
April 3rd report we have seen the gray whale every day (

Entry 2:
Holmes Harbor
- Usually in the afternoon and evening, he is alone and continues to leisurely move through the water in the same back and forth pattern, blowing with his back rolling out of the water then under the water for a bit of time . He seems quite content with the feeding situation here! We are getting used to his company.

Entry 3:
A new whale in our area. I took it while out with Mystic Sea on Saturday near
Bell's Beach
- and sent it to Erin at Cascadia since I couldn't figure out the identity. Erin's response: I am going to have our main gray whale person weigh in on it when she gets in this afternoon. Either way, it's a new whale to the region for this season. Unfortunately, it is not a very healthy looking whale. That large brownish patch on its side is an aggregation of whale lice, and when you start to see them in such concentrated numbers it usually suggests an underlying issue. This whale also looks pretty thin, so hopefully it hooks up with one of the regulars and figures out where the good eating is and can get itself back into shape. We also saw #531 by the north end of
Camano Island
.
