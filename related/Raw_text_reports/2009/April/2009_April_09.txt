We spotted a small
humpback
whale in
Clayton Pass
between Shearwater Island and Denny Island (North of Vancouver Island) at

8:40 am
. It breached right in front of the old cannery and spashed some folkes in an aluminum punt. It swam into the Harbour right in front of Shearwater Marine and circled there for a few minutes. It surfaced and blew several times before proceeding out into Llama Pass. It was probably feeding as there are a lot of herring around. What an amazing sight. We are sure lucky to have this in our own front yard! Happy Sightings - Ciao

Transients

April 7th when sonar was used in the Strait, were present today! At about

Dungeness Lighthouse
heading east, they ID'd these Transient orcas:
T30s', T172, T49A's. T14, plus T11 and T11A

It's

10:00 AM
and I'm watching several
gray whales
. There are at least 2 gray whales off of
Camano Head
. They're on the south side of the sand bar, diving deep and showing their flukes. They've changed direction of travel several times. There is
another gray whale
, mid channel between Langley and Camano Head traveling southeast towards Hat Island.
