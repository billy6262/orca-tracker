Cama (Beach, Camano Island
) about the
gray
, the guests in the deluxe cabins told me they had been watching it and it passed Breezy Point about

3:30 heading south
. Thanks for the heads up.

Saratoga Passage

After receiving the report above, I ran out to our neighbor's bluff viewpoint from north of Greenbank, & spotted the
gray whale
at

2:35 pm
, near the north end of Camano Island, closer to the Camano side of Saratoga passage, heading south at a pretty fast rate. After the few blows along the north end of Camano Island, roughly opposite Penn Cove, I saw two more gray whale blows at
4:00 PM along Lowell Point on the west side of Camano Island, opposite Greenbank,
heading south
.
