Orca Sightings for February 8, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
A group of
4-5 Transients
were sighted between V.G & V.H markers directly off of the
Victoria
waterfront. They were spotted from two land sightings and later observed by "Radar". This occured between
1400-1500
, the direction of travel was NE bound. They were believed to be the
T-41's
. Another possible sighting of more transients took place later in the afternoon, a few miles to the south of this location, mention of possible T-109's but not sure. Initally these animals were spotted from a residence in Victoria then also from Gonzalez Hill, confirming the report.
