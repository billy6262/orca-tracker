Orca Sightings for February 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
There are currently two
gray whales
between the southern tip of
Camano Island
and the northern tip of Hat/Gedney Island. I just saw one go straight up into the air. It was amazing. I have never seen that before in person. It is about
11am
.
