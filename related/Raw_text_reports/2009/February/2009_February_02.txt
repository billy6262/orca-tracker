I just got home from my first day of Whale Counting in
Santa Barbara/Goleta CA
area with Michael Smith. What a fantastic experience this is going to be. Anyway, we saw
Orcas
today off the island of Santa Cruz. We couldn't get a very good look at them to see any of their I.D. features, but definitely one male and a couple of other Orcas with him. There were a total of
4-5
. They were acting as if they were feeding and not necessarily traveling. We watched them for about 30 minutes and then they seem to of disappeared. There was a small flip-like activity from one of them at one time, but that was about it. Michael Smith was very excited. He stated that he had never seen Orcas from the point in the 5 years he has been doing the count.
