Entry 1:

hours on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone

, at
Bells Beach

At

6:45pm
, Northwest of
Langley
, I heard a
gray whale
splashing, blowing and breathing. The whale sounded like it was feeding on ghost shrimp close to shore. Too dark to see if there was more than one and I could not tell which direction it (they) headed off in.

I know you are away but I am hearing Orca on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
right now Sat evening at
9.30 pm
. As I am not well versed with the SR's sounds I cannot say who I am listening to. Perhaps J pod since it was reported that they were coming in from the west this afternoon. So good to hear them again.

We had gotten reports of
Orcas
near
Sooke
at

10:30 AM
headed toward us. We left at
1:00 not knowing for sure who or where the Orcas were. After visiting Race Rocks and all the Stellers, we headed West along the shore line and there they were! I thought they might be Ts, because there were so close to the rocks, but way in the distance, there was
J1
.
