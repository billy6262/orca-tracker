Orca Sightings for February 17, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
While on a surf trip to Ucluelet/Tofino (West Coast B.C) Friday 20th-Mon 23rd, I discovered that there had been some transient activity right in Ucluelet harbour on Feb.14. There were 5 animals in total- 2 males, 3 females. There are a few possible groups I had in mind for the I.Ds but I'll leave that to the researchers. The photos I've attached (not shown here) are poor quality; they were featured on the front page of the local paper. They were the only ones I could get a hold of. The photo here is of a single male seen in the Broken Island Group (just 5 miles away) on Feb.15 & 17th reported to have "others" with him but too far away for photographs. Possibly one of the males in the group if 5 ? It looks like T31 to me (& to Dave Ellifrit of CWR). After taking out a few stellers they continued SE.
