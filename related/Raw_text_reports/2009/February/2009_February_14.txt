Orca Sightings for February 14, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
While on a surf trip to Ucluelet/Tofino (West Coast B.C) Friday 20th-Mon 23rd, I discovered that there had been some transient activity right in Ucluelet harbour on Feb.14. There were 5 animals in total- 2 males, 3 females. There are a few possible groups I had in mind for the I.Ds but I'll leave that to the researchers. The photos I've attached (not shown here) are poor quality; they were featured on the front page of the local paper. They were the only ones I could get a hold of. The photo here is of a single male seen in the Broken Island Group (just 5 miles away) on Feb.15 & 17th reported to have "others" with him but too far away for photographs. Possibly one of the males in the group if 5 ? It looks like T31 to me (& to Dave Ellifrit of CWR). After taking out a few stellers they continued SE.

Eric just called me - he was flying back low over the water and spotted a
gray whale
at

4:35 PM
. The whale was traveling form
Camano Head
(Camano Isl) towards Sandy Point (Whidbey Isl). We'll go out tomorrow and see if we can find it and ID it.

We were talking to Windwalker Taibi at he & his wife's lovely gallery at the Greenbank Farm, just wondering when we'd get to see a gray whale, when we got the above message from Veronica - it was late and our good binoculars were at home, but we decided to head south to try to catch sight of our first
gray whale
of the season. We got to Sandy Pt. at about

5:45 pm
, just before dark, & in the far distance I saw a gray whale head pop up out of the water & then a big spout, but just caught that one glimpse before it got too dark. It was over near the mainland, between Tulalip and Marysville, heading south in
Possession Sound
. Let us know if you see it tomorrow!
