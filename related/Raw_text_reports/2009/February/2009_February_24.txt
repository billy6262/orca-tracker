Orca Sightings for February 24, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed north and finally after much searching, we encountered orca,
J pod
at
Turn Point
. We saw
J1, J8, J33, J26
and others (see
photo of Mom & calf J16 & J42
). They were really spread out, and seemed to be heading south toward San Jaun Island at 1.30 pm. It was my lucky day.

I got a call from Jeanne today about
1515
with a report of
J pod
at the north end of Andrew's Bay. Jeanne and I watched them (from shore) pass the Lighthouse around
1630ish
. We last saw them grouping up and pointed out toward
Discovery Is
. maybe a couple miles south of the light- great lighting for seeing blows. We got visual i.d.'s (and Jeanne was taking some pics) on
J1, J2, J8, J14, J16,J17,J19,J22,J26, J27, J28, J30, J32,J33,J34, J37,J38, J39, J40, J41,J42, and J44
.

We received an email that Jeanne Hyde was hearing orca calls from the OrcaSound hydrophone at

2:53 pm
, and a call from Jeff Hogan who was also listening in. We went to
OrcaSound.net
and were very happy to hear many calls for quite some time - almost as good as seeing them!

At about

2:45
I heard some very strange calls on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
. after listening for several minutes I finally heard what sounded like a J Pod call. J Pod was coming south in Haro Strait against a strong flood tide. They were spread out in small groups. I observed them near Andrews Bay and then went to
Lime Kiln
to watch. Their calls and clicks didn't seem to decrease the farther down island they got. Ruffles J1 and a female whale (guessing it was Granny J2 ) and also Spieden J8 were the farthest offshore as they neared Lime Kiln. New calf J44 was seen with a large group consisting of at least the J14s, J22s, Princess Angeline J17 and maybe more. Shortly after passing the light they began to move out toward Ruffles and company. They then grouped up into a line and headed straight for Discovery Island. That was at about
5:15 p.m. I have posted a couple pictures on my blog, including a pic of J44.
