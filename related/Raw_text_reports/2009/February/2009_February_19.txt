Orca Sightings for February 19, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went sailing out of Shilshole to PT Madison today. I was on my return trip around 5pm when I spotted
a pod
all around me headed south halfway
between Eagle Harbor and West Point
. This made for a beautiful
sunset
photo op as you can see.

We found out that
Orcas
were headed North today on the West Side San Juan Island at

7:30 this morning
. My passengers got there early, but it was still
11:45 before we got off the dock. I headed up Swanson Ch. because in the past I've seen them up there in Feb. Just North of Moat Pt. I saw a big splash in the distance, but kept quiet till I saw the blows for sure. We also went by Speiden Island, and Sentinel Reef. The new calf was there. So was J1, J2, J26, J27, and many more.

Faint calls being heard off

now (

Orca Network received calls from Jeff Hogan & John Boyd that
J pod
had been heard on both
OrcaSound hydrophones
early morning off west San Juan Island, heading
north
.
*
I woke up at
7am
today to hear a few soft
calls at lime kiln
- the calls got much louder, so i went outside to look and didn't see anything. I went back to listen to
Orcasound
.. and then i heard them on that hydrophone (further north)... finally i looked out in the middle of the strait and there they were! at
8:05am they were aprox 2-3 miles south east of
Kelp Reef
Headed north pretty quickly. It was a pretty good group with at least 2 large males, if i had to guess i would say J's.. but too far to know for sure... I called Dave Ellifrit from the center and hope they got a chance to go see who's here! take care!

Offshore by 2+ miles,
J Pods calls
heard at

7:45 am
. traveling fast in a group, 2 very large male fins - possibly Ruffles J-2 and Riptide J-30 only because their fins are the broadest at the top.

Hearing lots of
J-pod
(and more?) calls on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
at
8 am
.

This morning while on Facebook, I was alerted that one of my friends was listening to whales on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
. Sure enough, I tuned in and after a brief moment was able to hear vocalizations loud and clear. Ran upstairs to the scope and began scanning the Haro Straits. After approximately 15 minutes, we were able to spot two large fins three or four miles offshore, headed north at an amazingly fast clip at

8:21 AM
. It certainly looks like the boys have been growing this winter!

Hearing calls on

HPS amoungst Ship noise,

Orca Network heard

was near Swanson Channel by
mid-day
, continuing
north
.
*

11:59 am:
Turned on the hydrophone during our "sound underwater" class for 3rd graders and heard orca calls. Visually confirmed with at least two individuals in
Admiralty inlet
. Update at

12:20
: ship just passed; still seeing them near Marrowstone Island; they seemed to be traveling
south
, but may be milling/socializing, including breaches.

When the reports came in just before
noon
from the Port Townsend hydrophone via Chrissy at the PT Marine Science Center, we headed to Lagoon Point, Whidbey Island but we didn't seen any whales. Then Elsa Levitt at Bush Point called at
1:25 pm to say she had seen
4 or 5 orcas heading south
, so we hustled down to Bush Point, but missed them again. Apparently they were in a hurry, even though they were swimming against the tide. From about a mile south of Bush Pt. we saw at least
a dozen at
1:50
, maybe twice that or more, spread out over several miles along the western shore of Admiralty Inlet, all heading steadily
south
. From a lookout another few miles south we saw orcas rounding
Point No Point about
2:30
, still spread out. Next we went down to Scatchet Head, to a 200' bluff overlooking Possession Sound with Seattle on the horizon. From there we saw a far distant procession of
30 or more
in small groups over several miles, their blows glowing in the slanting sunshine, between Pt. No Point and Apple Cove Pt. The leaders crossed the
Edmonds/Kingston ferry lane about 4 pm
, still moving south. They were distant for most of our sightings, but appeared to be at least 4 adult males, and given the number of whales and adult males, our best guess is L pod, maybe plus K's .

Around
15 orca
off
Point No Point
, Puget Sound, at
1445
. 4 males, 8 - 10 females, 1 calf, patch still very red. direction: south at around 10kts. Some breaching, but they were spread from shore outward 1/2 to 3/4 miles in small groups. The large male had 2 notches in its dorsel looked like the transients that were in the hood canal a few years back. (this may have been L41?)

At about

2:50 P.M
. this afternoon, a group of friends and I watched a very large group of Orcas heading south to and around
Point No Point
in Hansville, WA. They were fairly close to the Kitsap side of the water and took about 10 or more minutes to pass through the area. They were definitely on the move and not feeding.

Tony Wilkie, Quartermaster on the Puyallup Ferry on the Edmonds/Kingston run, called Orca Network to report
8 - 12 orcas off Apple Cove Pt
, heading
south
. There was at least one mother/calf pair. The orcas were crossing their stern just before they entered the Kingston dock at
1620
.
*
We live on
President Point
, just south of Apple Tree Cove in Kingston. We just spotted upwards of
10 or so Orca's
travelling South towards Seattle at

4:30 pm
. They appeared to be playing as we saw one breach.

Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries called Orca Network at

5:10 pm
to relay a report from Lori Robertson, who was watching from the shore (N of Seattle, Carkeek Park area) as the
orcas
passed heading
south
.
