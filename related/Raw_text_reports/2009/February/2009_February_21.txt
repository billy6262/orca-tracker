Orca Sightings for February 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gail Fleming of Langley called to report 1 or 2
gray whales
off Sandy Pt (south of
Langley
, Whidbey Isl) at
8 am
, heading east.

I live in East Sooke, on a hillside overlooking Whiffen Spit and the entrance to the
Sooke Harbor Basin, BC
. In
late morning
, with the aid of my telescope, I spotted a male
Orca
heading north toward the open sea. As a point of reference I would say he was west of Whiffen Spit. There were a few small fishing boats in the area and they stayed put. A few minutes later I spotted two females heading in the same direction.
