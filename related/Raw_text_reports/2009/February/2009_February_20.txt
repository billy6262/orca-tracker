We headed down to Bush Pt. hoping the whales would venture closer to the Whidbey Island side, but they unfortunately stayed close to the mainland side. But we watched from about

4:45 -
5:30 pm
, and saw several breaches, lunges, spy hops, and possible foraging behaviors off the Foul Weather Bluff and Hood Canal entrance area - hopefully they were finally finding a few fish. We also were treated to a whole bunch of porpoise swimming south past Bush Pt. as we watched the orcas on the other side of the Inlet!
