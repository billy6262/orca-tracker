Orca Sightings for February 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research confirmed that Friday's encounter with the
Southern Residents
off Victoria included sightings of everyone in
all three pods
and "there are two new calves (one in J and one in L), but we are not officially specifying mums yet. We are conferring with Dr. John Ford and our Canadian colleagues before stating possible mothers. We would like to have several encounters with the babies and their mothers before assigning because grandma's may also confuse things." . No other encounters since then, except for the report above of hearing calls off Lime Kiln during the night.

Orca Nework received a call from Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research, with the great news that
J, K & L pods
were off the
Victoria waterfront at
2:30 pm
! Ken headed out to do a survey of the pods, and hopefully we'll have more details on ID's soon.

Orca Network received an update on the
superpod off Victoria
from Mark Malleson with Prince of Whales.
J pod
was reported inbound off Race Rocks at
11 am
. Mark took a look from land and realized it was all three pods, then headed out to try to find out who all was there. He was with them from
1400 - 1600
, and confirmed IDs for L
41 & the L11s
, with many more whales present, ID's to come soon. The whales were milling and foraging, and came within a mile of the Ogden Pt. breakwater, Victoria. At

the majority of the whales seemed to be heading SW.
