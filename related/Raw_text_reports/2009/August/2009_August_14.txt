Orca Sightings for August 14, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another flat calm, slack high tide, hardly any following ebb, sunny summer day out on the (pond like) Strait of Juan de Fuca. From

2:27pm to
3:39pm
we watched
L-Pod
whales actively forage
Hein Bank
. L-12 Alexis with L-22 Spirit, L-87 Onyx, L-89 Solstice, L-78 Gaia, and the L-5's! Many directional changes, lunges, and what seemed to be a push up- an orca came up in a vertical slant out of the water with its pectoral fins spread out and down, while we expected a breach, the whale gracefully slid back under!

At
1430 orcas
were off
Pt. Roberts
heading south. They came out of Active Pass and did not head up to the Fraser River.

I went out on
Monterey Bay
with Sanctuary Cruises. We followed 3 of what I assume are the
CA transient
group for quite a while. One of them seemed to have some recent significant damage to the dorsal, so much that we couldn't be sure whether it was male or female (see photo). Looking at the photo, I'd guess female from the curve in the front edge.

I'm happy to share this report from
Monterey
, for what it's worth. We were on Monterey Bay Whale Watch's morning cruise. We did see about
25 humpbacks
and
6-8 transient orcas
, which was the first orca sighing there in a couple of weeks. The humpbacks were mostly feeding uneventfully on the abundant small marine life at the surface, displacing many feeding birds as they surfaced. We saw some nice flukes when they dove quite near the boat. The orcas seemed to be in 2-3 small groups of one male and a couple of females, at some distance from us and not particularly active. We were also treated to several hundred
Risso's dolphins
surrounding us as we returned, breaching, cartwheeling and seemingly playing among the sailboats and kayaks just outside the harbor.

Tuned in late, but heard some clicks & calls on
Lime Kiln
around

10:30 pm
, then nothing for awhile, then these calls at
11 pm
.

2131
:
J, K and some Ls
moving south, just approaching
Orca Sound Hydrophones
(west San Juan Island) now from the north.
2156
: hearing nothing on OrcaSound now and all on Lime Kiln - thinking they are far off shore, because they were coming down from Turn Pt. this evening.

Orca Network received a call from Jerry, reporting watching a superpod of
80+ orcas
for 4 hours off Saturna Island - orcas arrived from several directions over several hours, and at
7 pm
they all met off the Saturna Island Lighthouse, with much surface activity & partying going on!
*
About
25 Orcas
travelling west in Boundary Pass made
Monarch Head
off Saturna Island between

6:15pm and
6:45pm
. The water was choppy with white caps and they were well offshore, so the count is a rough estimate -- may have been more. The whales were widely disbursed -- many solitary whales, with a number of small groups centered around mature females, including the lead group of four which appeared to be foraging around the cove at Taylor's Point on Saturna Island. One young whale, travelling alone, was doing a lot of porpoising, and another, serial breaching as it approached Monarch Head.

So excited to see a large group
(30 plus) of Orcas
off
Point Roberts
between
2 and 3 pm
. The whales were travelling swiftly, quite spread out, and heading south with some back and forth movement. There were at least 5 large males present; perhaps a Superpod of J, K, and L?!

We found
L pod
today around
Hein Bank
several groups spread out over 4 or 5 miles. Not a lot of above water action, a few tail lobs, no spyhops and only one breach spotted.

The
orcas
were near
Point Roberts
. I was really excited; we were seeing our resident orcas. (Resident orcas are the fish eating killer whales). There were around 40 animals, but it was hard to tell since they were spread out over a few miles. We had some great visuals. They seemed to be fishing and then playing. Some guests snapped some amazing pictures of tail slapping and spy hopping. We just watched and listened for about 30 minutes. On the way back home, it almost seemed as if the whales were following us. They trailed behind us a good portion of the way back.

This was a report in your most recent posting:

Entry 2:
5:50 am - Hearing a few calls and a tremendous amount of echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone. Wish I was observing behavior right now - are they fishing/hunting?
Suzy Roebling Suzy's question about the whales' behaviors yesterday morning answered my question about the whales' sounds over the hydrophones during the same time. I was watching the [
orcas
] at Lime Kiln starting at about

5:30 a.m
., but I was unable to hear them because the radio was not broadcasting. I was wondering about what I might be missing on the hydrophones - so thanks to Suzy now I know! The whales were moving north pretty much at a steady pace. They were spread for miles across the strait, mainly individuals or ones and twos. There were no surface behaviors that I observed other than surfacing to breathe. A few came in close to shore and again they were moving at a steady pace. Then there was a lull, during which time two came by, then one individual. Others were approaching from the south. Then (it was a little after
9a.m.
) all of a sudden there was Cappuccino right in front of me! He changed direction several times, appeared to be foraging, before he continued north. By this time the hydrophone was broadcasting at Lime Kiln, so I was able to hear him and the others who were way to the south. Those who were to the south turned and went back south.

The
T18's
were seen this am at
10.30.
I was on the 9 am Zodiac out of Victoria. Mark Malleson ID this foursome. Apparently they have been hanging out in this area for four days now. We caught up with these
Transients
off
Moresby and Coal Island
, near Swartz Bay. I have included a pic of T 19B (cropped), the male with an unusual, broad based Dorsal Fin. They were busy traveling toward the Gulf Islands when we left them and looking for prey along the shoreline of Moresby.

I saw a
large whale
while sailing about three miles north of
Protection Island
. It had a fairly small and slightly hooked dorsal fin set well back, and a distinct gray collar. It was considerably bigger than the minke whales I have seen around here. It never showed flukes but did blow visibly. I have seen humpbacks in the past and I'm pretty sure it wasn't one. I watched it surface and dive several times and never saw flippers, or flukes. Its behavior was very much like fin and minke whales I have seen before. It's hard to estimate length but it was a lot bigger than any orca I have seen, and maybe around 50 feet. It seemed to be cruising around in the shipping lanes.

Orca Network received a call from Arlene Solomon at
11 am
, she was observing a pod of
~14 orcas
, scattered between
Mayne & Prevost Island
, heading NE into Active Pass.
*

7:30 am
-
Orcas
spread out and moving slowly northward making lovely calls with no buzzing boats or thumping tankers. Passby is taking more than an hour. Hearing J calls.

5:50 am
- Hearing a few
calls
and a tremendous amount of echolocation on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
