Orca Sightings for August 1, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We encountered
T14 "Pender"
a couple of miles NE of 10 mile point at around
12.30pm
as we were heading back to Victoria. T14 was traveling north towards
D'arcy Island
and we saw him surface several times.

All three pods headed north together last night (7/31), but were found taking two different routes south again today.
J-Pod, K-Pod, and at least the the L2s and L7s from L- Pod
took a "normal" route down
Boundary Pass
, past Turn Point, and down to the west side of San Juan Island, but the rest of L-Pod came down
Presidents Channel and San Juan Channel
before heading up to reunite with the other pods. On the Western Explorer this afternoon we met up with the Ls in San Juan Channel. The L12s were in the lead, with another large group of L-Pod whales a little ways behind them. In this larger group I was able to get positive IDs of L5, L73, L84, L74, L100, L26, L90, L92, L82, and L105, so it looks like most of the family groups were probably there. After getting back to port I headed out to
Land Bank
on the westside of San Juan Island, where at about 5 PM I saw the last groups of Js and Ks heading south. J1 was close to shore with L53, but other than that the whales were spread out across Haro Strait.

While crossing down
Boundary Pass
, [
orcas
] began passing the boat heading for the Turn Point Lighthouse (
1115
). As a few whales got close enough to ID, we were happy to find we were viewing
J Pod & K Pod
. The whales seemed to be very active, with lots of surface percussives - spyhops, tail lobs, headstands, and a few breaches by the calves. But the fireworks really got going when the whales hit the tide rips near Turn Point. They were actively working the line between the strong floodtide and the upwellings, and soon a group consisting of L2 Grace, L78 Gaia (his rakes are healing nicely), L90 Ballena began to breach one after the other. Five breaches in a row, where one whale would breach and before that one was finished, the next whale would breach. We left the whales and began to head home and discovered L Pod traveling down San Juan Channel! They were spread in groups of 7-8, with whales from mid channel all the way to shoreline. For our second trip, we joined up with the
L's
still moving down
San Juan Channel
(
1530
). By this time, there were only 2-3 boats on scene, all giving the whales 200 yards or more. It was amazing to see these whales working the tide - they would find the back eddies and use them to power against the current. These L's were probably the most active I've seen in quite some time with over 15 breaches, tons of tail lobs, porpoising, and other surface percussives. And for only the 3rd or 4th time in the last few years, I watched residents work the shore along Cape San Juan and Goose Island. Then the whales headed right for the Cattle Point lighthouse, giving the shore watchers a nice viewing as well. We left the whales at
1630
, and they were porpoising towards Eagle Point (J's & K's by this time were at Lime Kiln, so I imagine they were hearing each other).

We were out on a morning tour in Canadian Waters viewing Orcas from
J & K pods
heading south from the
Gulf Islands
on their routine swim following salmon through these waters. We could hear the blows (hot moist air) being expelled through the blowhole! A few breaches, tail slaps! We were heading home when to our disbelief L pod was in
San Juan Channel
!! More Orcas!! Right outside our home port of Friday Harbor. This happens on occasion (once a year?), but it is really unusual and such a treat!! Despite the boats, they sure seemed to be enjoying themselves - breach after breach and tail slaps as they continued south through the channel.

4 transient killer whales
, 1 large male, 1 smaller orca with perhaps two females. at

8:15 pm
passing about 400 meters from Pipers lagoon in the
Georgia Strait
. There were various kayaks and small pleasure craft vessels following closely behind them all the while - frustrating to watch from shore. The orcas seemed to be checking out the rocks abeam of us where seals haul out, we had 1 seal close to us off the beach. They then passed in front of snake island, passing New Castle Island and then were passing Gabriola Island (Nanaimo side).

Candi Emmons reported
L pod
coming down
San Juan Channel
this afternoon, then heading through Cattle Pass.
*
Fairly large pod of
Orcas
just passed
Saturna Island
heading west. Guessing about 35-45, but water was too choppy and they were too spread out to get a good count. Numerous mature males -- no positive ID's. Last of them made Monarch Head and Java Its about
10:30 am. Mainly travelling, but some foraging possible around Java as a good number were doubling back and moving across the main flow -- lingering for 10-15 minutes. Average amount of breaching, fluking etc.

Orca Network received a call from Jessie Glenden of WDFW, saying he'd talked to several Tuna fishermen at
Westport WA
, & around
noon
they saw 2 adult
orcas
& 1 calf at 46 51N, 124 38W.
