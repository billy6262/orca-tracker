Orca Sightings for August 29, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I don't know if it was the early evening light or if this was the most beautiful
Minke Whale
on the planet - but anyway, a Minke surfaced three times off
Marrowstone Point
about 75 yards out last night about
6 p.m
. Absolutely magnificent animal. Its back was so sleek and unmarked and the dorsal was so tall and curved, elegantly. The second time up it showed a lot of its face too. Crisp white along the throat. Lots of sandlance and herring around for them now!

I first saw this
Humpback
Whale in
Monterey Bay CA
last year; this year she's back with a calf! Thought you might be interested due to the marks on her flukes that I assume are from Orca teeth. We don't hear about much interaction between these two species in this area, so I don't know whether it was our local transients or some that she met between here and her breeding grounds in Central America.

I listened to
Southern Residents
on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophones
from

11:30 am to just after
12:30 pm
. I never heard anything on the OrcaSound hydrophone further north, and heard the whales were heading south.

John McKenzie called Orca Network to report
4 orcas
just outside of
Sequim Bay
today at
1420
. He was kayaking, and the whales circled the kayaks for about 20 minutes, appearing to be feeding, then headed east toward Discovery Bay.

T14
was in
Campbell River
, he spent some time next to the shore. Transients are here.

Mac LaMay of Whidbey Island called to report one
Gray whale
between
Hat/Gedney Island
and Everett, in about 15' of water at

2:20 pm
. It appeared to be feeding.
