Orca Sightings for August 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At iceberg point on the southern tip of
lopez island
at about
6.30
looking south towards port townsend, and saw a whale that was not an orca. it was bigger, had a smaller fin. it was by itself, meandering around, and gradually working its way east. My guess is that it was a humpback whale. just curious if anyone else has mentioned a sighting in that area? thanks,

We sent photos of minke & humpback fins & asked a few questions to clarify the species on this sighting, & received further information: "the flukes didn't ever come out of the water, but i was able to see them once close to the surface (but still under the water). also, as we were watching the whale, we were remarking about the fact that we never saw a spout. i would say that the shape of the fin was more like the minke, but smaller than the one pictured." We are pretty sure this sighting was of a Minke, given the observations & location of the whale - sb

8:14 -
9:18 am
: There are [
orcas
] everywhere - resting family lines, tail slaps, spyhops, and a lazy fog rolling in to the shoreline - beautiful. It certainly looked like there could have been members from all three pods. I am sure I saw J's and Mega- Mega was in a beautiful resting line of approx 12-14 whales.

At around

7:00am
I heard
Orcas
in
Boundary Pass
off Saturna Island, near Monarch Head. There was dense fog, mist and light rain, so it was not so easy to make them out. I counted something like 15 - 20, heading west. It was slack tide turning to ebb, with them, but I'd say they were taking their time, very subdued - only two breaches in the half an hour I watched, which is unusual for this passage. The last group was a mature female accompanied by four younger whales, and they went in very close to shore at Monarch Head and swam pretty much in a circle for a couple of minutes, then just floated in the water at the surface for close to a minute, more or less just drifting with their dorsals visible the whole time. Overall I'd say they were not in a hurry, and very much conserving their energy.

We went sailing with friends out of the Port of
Everett
, and didn't go far, when looking south my wife at

3:30 pm
saw the blow of a whale just off shore of the Naval Base. The whales where heading south less than a mile from the shore, with us about 2 miles farther out, so we turned south to get a better view. At the naval base they turned west, then north in a large slow arc and came straight at us, we cut sail and let them pass, one came about 60 feet from our starboard side and we got some good pictures. There were 2
grays
, feeding slowly on bottom, and coming up every few minutes. They never breached but were rolling slowing on the surface and we saw plenty of fins and tails, with a nose poking out everyone once in a while. I estimate one at about 45 feet long and the others slightly smaller at 39-40 feet. They rotated north, around Everett and headed toward Gedney Island fairly slowly. The last we saw them there were heading north in
Possession Sound
past Gedney Island.
