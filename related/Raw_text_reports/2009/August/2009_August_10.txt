Orca Sightings for August 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We sailed our boat S/V Windswept off
Salmon Bank
and witnessed a special event. There was a small pod of 2 maybe three adult
orcas
escorting what seemed like 4 younger orcas. One was very young and much smaller then the others that were playing with him. It appeared that they were trying to teach the youngest how to do jumps and rolls. We watched as two would get on each side of the youngest and lift him out of the water on their backs and roll him.

Reports of all 3 pods heading in from the west;
J's & K's
headed northwest up
Haro Strait
, while we found
L's
between
False bay and Eagle Point
, some near shore, others spread 1/8 mile off of San Juan Island at

2:12pm
. L-41 Mega was actively foraging with the first part of the flooding tide. A number of females and juveniles fished closer to shore, all making directional changes yet working their way east toward Cattle Point, so we enjoyed watching them until

3:45pm
. They were actively vocalizing as well, a treat since conditions allowed us to drop our hydrophone and drift for awhile. We don't often see the blows of killer whales, today they showed against the backdrop of the shore cliffs.

We had reports of a potential Super Pod coming in from the West! By the time our trip departed in the afternoon, we heard that
L's
were down around
Middle Bank
heading for shoreline, and that
Js & K's
were at
Kelp Reef
aiming for Kellett Bluff. We were just north of Kellett Bluff at
1510
when we spotted two orcas slowly moving north, and it was none other than J1 Ruffles having quality time with his mom J2 Granny. Ruffles was doing the usual very slow rise to the surface, where his dorsal fin would slowly rise out of the water like a periscope. As this pair lazily passed the boat, our passengers were amazed at the size of his dorsal fin. The echoes of their blows rang off the bluff. Granny was about 400 yards or so past us and suddenly she showed that 98 year-olds can still breach with the best of them. It wasn't long after that J34 Doublestuff, J27 Blackberry, and a majority of J Pod began to catch up to the matriarch and her son. And apparently they were in the mood to play--7 breaches in a row, tail slaps, cartwheels, chin ups, pushing each other from below, and lots and lots of, well, "sea snakes". It seemed like every male that passed the boat was in a randy mood and happily showed it.

Ron Bates, MMRG, received reports early this morning that a large number of
Orcas
had been sighted near
Constance Bank
. Our vessel departed Victoria Harbour this morning around
9am
and within less than 10 minutes of leaving the Harbour we made contact with the Orcas a couple of miles west of Clover Point! Not long after we had arrived on scene we soon realized that we had a
Superpod
as our Naturalist Kyla Graham and Ron, soon identified several members of all three southern resident pods. As we sat with our engines off we could see a large group of over 60 Orcas moving East towards Clover Point and another large group a few hundred yards ahead also moving East. The Orcas were in resting formation and tightly bunched. The Orcas continued East towards Trial Island and eventually the Orcas did travel through Enterprise Channel and then L-pod split and traveled south whilst J & K-pod traveled towards 10 mile point. Not all of L-pod was present as Mega and part of the L-12's were reported to be heading West past Sooke.

Very loud calls on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
. There are many different calls, sounds like some could be Kpod. Time is

16:44
.
1658
- Starting to hear calls and clicks on OrcaSound Hps. Sounds like some calls are Kpod.

1:51 pm
: I just started hearing whales on the
OrcaSound hydrophone
. You can hear them on Lime Kiln too, but there's a lot of interference noise.

After getting Lori's report, we tuned into
OrcaSound
at

2:50
, listened to OS hydrophone (NW San Juan Island) until

3:50
- lots of loud
calls
, at first, then dwindling w/some boat noise but calls still happening at
3:50; then at
3:50 checked Lime Kiln & hearing calls there as well - not sure of direction now, since calls have been heard off both hydrophones for several hours now!
1621
: STILL hearing calls on BOTH Lime Kiln & Orca Sound hydrophones - hard to say which direction they're going, they must be spread out between the 2 & milling or going back & forth! Calls off both HPs since at least 1351! At
1735
, calls still being heard on OrcaSound, but not on Lime Kiln.

We had a dozen or more
orcas
slowly travelling west-to-east off Flint Beach, South Lopez, between

6:15 and
6:30
this evening.

I got a second hand report that a fisherman had seen an
orca
traveling west off
point wilson
(around

7:30 or 8pm
).

We encountered a
Humpback
Whale a few miles to the West of
Constance Bank
after hearing one of the other boats had seen the Humpback pop up near a large Bait Ball!

I observed two
gray whales
transiting southbound past our house on
Saratoga Passage
. They were about two or three hundred yards offshore, progressing slowly and surfacing about every four and a half minutes. I watched as they loitered in
Cama Bay
, just north of the new State Park, for about one hour. Perhaps they were feeding as it is rather shallow there. They surfaced in about one minute cycles during that time. They then slowly began to progress back northbound, but much closer to shore. The pair passed the house with one swimming inside the mooring buoy line and one just outside of the mooring buoy line.
