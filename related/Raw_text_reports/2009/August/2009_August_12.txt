Orca Sightings for August 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At around

2:00pm
I saw a couple of whale boats in
Boundary Pass
off Saturna Island, but no whales. After about five minutes, four
Orcas
surfaced, an adult and three juveniles. After watching a while longer, I decided they must be transients, based on their diving/surfacing pattern -- dive for 2-3 minutes, surface together for three breaths, repeat. They did this for close to an hour, drifting towards the west, coming up unpredictably and swimming in all directions. At around
2:20, they dove for at least 10 minutes, but then surprisingly surfaced again right in the middle of the accumulating whale watch boats. I believe I've seen the adult before, a male with a very large wide dorsal that droops markedly to the left. By
3:00pm, they drifted out of sight at Taylor's Point on Saturna Island, still moving west.

At about

12:45
we were lucky enough to be the boat that picked up the
Transient orcas T19s
between Patos and
East Point
. We watched the four whales - T18, T19, male T19B, and T19C - as they slowly circled the area. You can read the details of our adventure and see some photos on my blog. They stayed in Boundary Pass for the rest of the afternoon.

Transient killer whales T-19 and T-19B
with another sprouting? male and female hunting for harbor seals around Java Rocks off of
Saturna Island
, Canada, from

2:37pm to
3:32pm
. Slack ebb tide made for pond like conditions. The four whales circled the rocks several times, while the harbor seals on land were on alert with backs arched, some going for higher ground! There were seals in the water looking nervously about. They did make some sudden turns and lunges, underwater kills? At the west end of the rocks, T-19B paused sideways while the other 3 whales rapidly came toward him, a few lunges, one showed it's flukes, then a few tails lobs, before they headed northwest towards Saturna. T-19B's dorsal fin looks so big and heavy, growing faster than the rest of him, the weight of it leaning left, and he is only 14 years old- he's going to be huge at full maturity!!

This afternoon, another boat had spotted the
Transient Orcas
! We had a feeling they must be out somewhere, with the Residents miles and miles away. Generally when the fish-eating (resident) Orcas of J, K, L pods are out of range, then there are mammal-hunting (transient) Orcas in the neighborhood. Known as the
T19s
this group was out in Canadian waters. When we arrived they were "resting" (the term used for Orca sleep). Slow synchronized dives in a tight knit group. As they neared some rocks the small group split up, circling around and around. There were a lot of harbor seals resting just above the water's edge as well as a few unsuspecting seals in the water. If they did indeed feed, then they were quite graceful about it because we never noticed any sudden dives or charges below to grab a seal. The transients then continued on their way, back in a tight group hugging the shoreline.

I was lucky to see many members of the
Southern Resident Orca
heading out west this morning. I was on the
9 am
'Ocean Magic 2' and we encountered the tall boys, J 27 'Blackberry' and ? J 26 'Mike'. It was bright lighting so hard to ID this one in the enclosed pic, but feel sure it was J 26 or K 21 - right side saddle patches somewhat similiar. I did see, I believe, K 11 not too far off as well.
