Started listening in to the
Orcasound.net hydrophones
, first at Lime Kiln, San Juan Island at

10:55 am
- great
calls
! At
11:30 I switched to the OrcaSound hydrophone, calls there too - & when I went back to Lime Kiln a little after noon, I was still hearing calls on both. At
12:35, no calls on Lime Kiln, but still calls on OrcaSound, but getting faint, so they are likely traveling north?

Ocra's
were sighted this morning at

8:40 AM
just south of Whiskey Point on
Quadra Island BC
. Approximate coordinates are: N 50° 02.165, W 125° 12.917'. They were heading south toward Cape Mudge at the southern tip of Quadra Island and toward the Strait of Georgia. We estimate the dorsal fin of the largest orca to be around 4 feet in height.
Ken and Kathy Robertson, Quadra Island, BC

Greg Arden of Seattle called Orca Network to report seeing a large
whale
heading south not far from shore off Discovery Park, Seattle this morning at

8:30 am
. He heard it spout, said it was larger than an orca, & had no dorsal fin, so sounds like a Gray whale.
