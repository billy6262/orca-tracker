Orca Sightings for August 25, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were on a charter with Deer Harbor Charters. The vessel was trying hard to catch up to a 'resident'
pod
that was reported to be
between Patos Island and Point Roberts
and heading north. Around

15:00
a 'blow' was sighted to the west (and appeared heading south) and the vessel headed toward it. The whale pod, identified by Natalie as a
transient
pod of about 3 or 4 whales, ended up north of the vessel, and was actually heading east (ultimately along the north shore of Patos). The pod seemed like they followed or chased something into a slight 'cove' formed by a 'hook' peninsula on the north shore of Patos (the whales were heading east into the 'mouth' of the 'cove'). They lingered and swam around there for a while.
