Orca Sightings for August 28, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
K-Pod
spread from
Eagle Point
out over Salmon Bank, slowly foraging individually and in groups of 2 to 4, from about

2:30 to
3:30pm
. With slack flood tide the whales seem to be meandering back and forth, first heading northwest, then southeast, as they swept the area on long dives, almost synchronizing their surfacings. We observed K-21 Cappuccino with his older sister K-40 Raggedy not far behind. K-13 Skagit, and family K-25 Scoter, K-27 Deadhead, and K-34 Cali, stuck close together in somewhat of a resting pattern, yet taking those long dives. We were able to listen to intermittent vocalizations. Flat water, overcast skies, and the mellow whales set the tone for a relaxed trip. The rest of K-Pod was heading back toward San Juan Island.

A complete surprise while on our way into Vancouver via the Victoria to Vancouver Adventure crossing with Prince of Whales;
Jpod
was fishing near the north arm of the
Fraser River
around

7:30pm
. Here, J27 and younger sibling J39 are showing communication and/or foraging behavior; tail slaps, pec slaps, even a breach!. You can see that Mako J39 copies what his big brother Blackberry J27 is doing and that they are a team!. It's a heart warming observation to see the two together in this way. I was thinking about them all night! A video of that event can be found
here

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND viewing it - it truly captures J39 learning from his older brother! sb

2 nautical miles east of Providence Cove on Vancouver Is (
juan de fuca
) 1/8 mile off the beach at

10:30am
we spotted a single large male
Orca
moving fast eastward. We are just completing a circumnavigation of Van Is and this is the first Orca we have seen since being on the outside. We have however seen several Humpback and Minke along the way as well as countless sealions and several large rafts of sea otters!
