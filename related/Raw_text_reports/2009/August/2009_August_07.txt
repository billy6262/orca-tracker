Orca Sightings for August 7, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Off of
False Bay, San Juan Island
, from

2:32pm to
3:37pm
, we watched the
L-5's
and
L-54's
forage toward the east with the strong flood tide. The mom's near shore, the males further offshore demonstrating their power and grace with rapid twists and turns. L-74 Saanich was lunging, turning sideways, still showing a little wobble in his dorsal fin, about 1000 feet away when he dove. Since he was making many directional changes, I told our passengers to look out into the water, sometimes you can see the white patches on the orca before the whale surfaces. L-74 surprised us all by slowly appearing about 10? feet underwater right next to the port side of the boat! The unusual thing was he stayed there for about 2 minutes, seem to go under the boat and came right below the surface on the starboard side, where he stayed for another minute or so before sinking down. He finally surfaced well past 2 other whale watch boats to our starboard side. The initial dive through encounter to finally surfacing lasted several minutes. I wonder that a salmon was under our boat (I hope he got it!), as he seemed to be on his side, utilizing his monocular vision? We could only see the white glow of an eye patch and part of his chin when he was on our port side, and passengers on the starboard side they exchanged eye contact with him!! If that was not magical enough (L-74 made the unpredictable approach- the safest thing for us to do was to shut down), L-73 Flash (whose dorsal fin sure is wavy like J-1 Ruffles swam with little L-108 Coho keeping up 50 feet behind him, zigzagging rapidly as they fished, 500 feet away. As they turned east, L-108 breached!

Around

12:15
while sitting on the computer I heard the
blows
on the beach just as my husband called out "Whales!" I made the 4 minute mad dash through the neighborhood and down the bluff trail to the beach and they were
two humpbacks
(
more likely grays
, but not confirmed - sb) - I think - heading north northeast in Saratoga Passage just South of Sandy Point heading towards Camano Head. They did some deep dives and hung about in the middle of the passage feeding for a bit. I am 90% sure they were humpbacks by their flukes and swim pattern, but did not have binoculars to confirm this.
Liz Heinrich, Whidbey Island
From further info. from Liz, & the report above, we think these were likely grays. She observed a "heart- shaped" spout, which is indicative of grays, & we've had reports of 2 grays feeding between this area & Everett as recently as
July 27th - very late for feeding grays to remain in this area! sb
More on humpback whale sighting off Everett: Thanks for getting back to me. There was definitely a caudal dorsal fin not knuckles. I have spent my whole life on the water and as a naturalist on land and sea, rely heavily on my observation skills. You only get a second to see the details and so have to record them quickly and recheck when you can. I have seen alot of grays also and know the knuckles you speak of, this was a small fin. In regards to the blow, I looked it up in some of our whale books (husband taught marine science at the Ocean Institute in Dana Pt Ca and we are both book hounds) and the books describe the Humpback spout as "bushy and wide" which is what I saw, it wasn't a straight up spout, sort of heartshaped, the height was hard to say as but it seemed like they were around 10' tall, there was not alot to compare it to as they were heading at a diagonal away from the beach and toward open water. Another big clue for me was the tail, the flukes were more upright when they were diving and not the classic gray tail shape. They didn't show flukes until they were out too far to determine if there were knobbies on them w/o binos. Anyway, hope that helps - keeping ears and eyes peeled. Thanks for all you do!

In the
afternoon
trip we were happy enough to see some
Lpod
members near the south of
San Juan Island
, on which L73 and L74 identified report continued below under humbacks.

This afternoon around

1:30
we met up with
all three pods
about two miles east of
Active Pass
. They absolutely booked it north this morning, having been just north of San Juan Island around
9:30 AM. All whales were reportedly there except the L5s and L54s (who were picked up off of Hein Bank around that time), but they were spread over 5+ miles and heading northeast. J27, J31, and J39 were traveling with L2, L78, and L88. K- Pod seemed to be the last group to exit the Pass and the last group we looked at was K21, K40, K16, and K35 traveling tight together.

In the Strait of Georgia, we again saw
Ruffles and Granny
- travelling with L53 again along with her mother L7, Canuck!
Suzanne Charest, Wild Whales Vancouver

To our surprise, we just saw
two gray whales
in
Saratoga Passage
near Camano Island moving north between Pebble Beach and Timothy Way at
2 pm
. They surfaced more often than we see during their normal presence in the spring. Were there any other sightings reported?
2:38 pm - they turned and headed south, now just off Pebble Beach, SW Camano Island.

humpbacks
!
