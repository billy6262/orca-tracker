Orca Sightings for August 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call today from Erica Crust at WA Dept. of Fish & Wildlife - reporting a pod of ~
30 orcas
2.5 miles off Carrol Island near
La Push
.

Today's journey to Sooke Basin was nothing short of SPECTACULAR. A mother and calf
humpback
pair were lazily swimming by when all of a sudden they both started to fly out of the water at full speed breaching. At times they breached together, or tagging one another! It was by far the most incredible thing i have seen on the water and i have seen many incredible things over the years. I have waited my whole life for this. I want to thank our captain Anna Hall who made the intuitive navigational choices today, and because of that, we had witnessed nonstop breaches for about 10+ mins window (see photo of the day above). After witnessing the
humpbacks
, we stopped by Race Rocks to see the harbour seals and sea lions hauled out. Finally, southern resident killer whales
Lpod
were making their way past Victoria towards the east and were beautifully sighted heading into the distance towards Haro Strait.

11:50am
-
Orcas
observed from beach off
Westside Road, San Juan Island
. Orcas traveled Northbound on the full moon spring tide, with tall male dorsal fins leading the set. The array of fins indicated J-Pod. At
12:41pm an orca changed direction, and soon after there was some arched diving and rostrums out of the water near shore, possibly during predation. One orca's calls could be heard in air when it's rostrum broke the surface. J1 then made his appearance; there was no mistaking him. Two females with two juveniles then appeared from the South, staying in the area for some time. The sound of an orca exiting the water drew my attention to witness a full breech visible just off-shore. The vanguard of the pod then turned and came back past, and all continued to criss-cross and mill in the area until around 2pm, when they then traveled South out of sight.

8:00pm
- Orcas observed from inside tent at
County Park, San Juan Island
. About 4-5 animals were traveling Southbound at a rapid pace, though surfacing normally. There were no boats present as the mixed-gender group blazed past along the Westside.

The
Orcas
returned and were within reach today! The killer whales from
J & K pods
, along with a
few L pod
members had made their way south from the Fraser River down
Rosario Strait
to the southwest end of San Juan Island. They were very spread out, milling, feeding from inshore near False Bay out several miles from the shore. This
afternoon
they had been going north with members of J pod around the Lime Kiln lighthouse off the west side of San Juan Island, when they all turned around heading south. We also heard a report of some L pod members coming in from their day in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Maybe they'll all meet up tonight for a little social hour?! We had an amazing encounter and were caught off guard with a group of 5 Orcas coming our way. We were shutdown and had to remain that way till they were at least 100 yards away. They surfaced and dived playing with each other, changing from moving offshore to then parallel the shore. Our guests were dazzled when they heard some vocalizations even above the surface of the water! I love when it is calm enough to hear this occur! We moved further offshore to see L78 Gaia, a 20-year-old male along with his 16-year-old brother L88 Wavewalker. L88 is a "sprouter male", which means his dorsal fin is still growing and could reach a height of 5-6 feet tall like other male Orcas. As I was looking through my binoculars at L78, I saw a scar/gash/unusual mark on his right side where his dorsal meets the body, before the saddle patch. A little later he had turned, and on the left side there was another scratch/scar starting just at the front of the dorsal.

We heard rumors of
all pods
heading north up
San Juan Island
, & at

12:50 pm
began hearing loud calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. Calls stopped for awhile, then began again at
1:13 pm, then by
1:40 they were really partying!

While in
Haro Strait
, we were lucky enough to see Ruffles copulating! He afterwards travelled with the lucky lady for a little while, giving several chances for identification. I was fairly certain it was L53, Lulu.
