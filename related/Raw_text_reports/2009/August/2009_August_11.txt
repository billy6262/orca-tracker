Orca Sightings for August 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Joe Huckaba, reporting a sighting of an
orca
pod off
Brookings, OR
. He saw 2 pods 15 miles offshore of Brookings, heading north (42 04.774N, 124 42.686W) from
10 - 11 am
. 1 pod had 12 - 15 orcas, the next group had 6 - 8 orcas (they were within 1/4 mile of each other). No photos were taken.
*
Orca Network received a call rom Douglas Laird, reporting seeing 1
orca
25 - 30 miles out from
Charleston, OR
, heading north at
1 pm
.

We were sailing off
Sidney
Marina, BC, when we encounted this pod of
Orcas
. It was at

3:30 PM
. We were unable to positively identify the pod.

Minke
traveling east to west out from Swirl Rocks,
Lopez Island
, around
7pm
(travelling roughly SW from Aleck Bay on South Lopez out into the straits). And large surface area of the water closer to shore that was rippling with small fish. Great to see evidence that there are still some fish out there.

10 pm
- I have been listening (on
OrcaSound hydrophones
) to incredible and wonderful Orca calls, Echolocation clicks, whistles, grunts and groans of the Southern Residents for the past 90 mins. Must be party time again off San Juan Island once again. I suspect the orca are moving away as the calls are getting fainter but still audible and really quite musical.

calls
tonight on
OrcaSound
San Juan Island.

A superpod of
Orcas
were heading toward Boiling Reef. Roughly 40+ whales passed
Saturna's East Point
starting around

2:15pm
moving west in Boundary Pass, spread out about a mile and a half east to west and travelling well away from shore. They were moving pretty fast with the ebb current, and made Taylor's Point on Saturna Island starting around
2:45pm. Some breaching along the way, but mostly just travelling.

Recorded the crazy party (superpod
orca calls
) at night from
Lime Kiln
- unbelievable.

The
Orcas
of
J, K, L pods
had all convened in
Haro Strait
. There were whales spread out in small groups generally heading north when we arrived on scene. They did an 'about face' and in large groups moved south till they all had met in 2 large groups. Our guests were in awe as we watched this mass of Orcas all swimming together to meet up and have a whale party! There were a few breaches, tail slaps, rollovers with a pec slap and then the grand finale - the pink sea snake! They continued on to the south and we headed home.

At

12:52
started hearing calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
- sounds more like
Transients
than Residents. Calls continued off and on until about 1320. Transient calls again at OrcaSound hydrophone - began again at
1436
, continued on until after
1500
. I recorded the calls at Lime Kiln - see below post from Scott Veirs for the links to listen in at Orcasound.net.

From Scott Veirs: Definitely sounds like transients to me, but more abbreviated and less "plaintive" than the Hood Canal recordings or one I found here a few weeks ago recorded up at Queen Charlotte's latitude. I've uploaded your recording here (scroll down to the bottom of "archived sounds from Lime Kiln") and a short (5s) clip here in the common sounds player (scroll down in the "other sounds" window to Transient calls).

Turned in at the
OrcaSound hydrophones
(

1:31 pm
PST) and bingo! Some calls, orca, but not resident.

Any idea of what going on with the distorted sounds on the
lime kiln hydrophone
right now (

12:50pm
)? Hearing very sad sounding calls on
orcasound
.
1:03 pm - They're on the Lime Kiln now.

We heard a few
Southern Resident orca calls
on the
Orcasound hydrophone
at about

6:47 pm
, then boat noise, then a few more calls. At

7:50 pm
, we heard some strange calls, whistles, & clicks on the Lime Kiln hydrophone, then at

8:05
more distant calls. -
