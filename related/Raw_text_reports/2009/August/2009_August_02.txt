Orca Sightings for August 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were sailing south from the south tip of
Camano Island
towards Everett, along the "ledge" (dropoff) that runs from the mouth of the Snohomish along Jetty Island. We saw whales blowing to the south. (I am
guessing they were grey whales
). From what we could see, they were near the entrance to the harbor, right off from the green buoy. As we continued to sail south, they headed north. We eventually realized that there were two whales, both of them located inland from us, feeding in the shallows alongside Jetty Island. They appeared to be slowly swimming sideways, with one side fin up in the air, and with a portion of the tail visible. We guessed they were feeding on the bottom. We got a good look at their fins and tails, which were heavily mottled. My husband checked the depth and it showed at about 10 feet, so the whales were feeding in something shallower than that, which is hard to believe given their size. After passing by the first whale, suddenly the second one turned and started towards us. (Could have been spooked by power boat in vicinity?) Although we attempted to turn out of its way, it kept on towards us with its fin up in the air. Suddenly there was a huge cloud of sand in the water, and the whale went directly underneath our boat! Although we were too busy trying to get out of the way to check the depth sounder, nevertheless we are fairly certain we were in less than 20 feet of water when it went underneath. As our sailboat draws about 4 feet, that means it was a close one, as this 35-40 ft (est) animal only had 15 ft of depth (at most) to squeeze by. It didn't surface again until it was quite a long way off. This is as close an encounter as I care to have, thank you.

We headed south on our
12.30pm
tour and skipper Trev sighted a
Humpback
Whale approx 2 miles south of
Constance Bank
. The Humpback was in hunting mode and changed direction several times whilst doing 4-8 minute dives. From a small white mark near the Dorsal fin I managed to identify that this Humpback has been seen in the area in previous years.Regards,

Caroline Spehar, naturalist for Mystic Sea Charters, relayed some great reports of watching
all 3 pods
of Southern Residents as they came out of
Active Pass
, heading west to east, becoming VERY active as they exited Active Pass. They were feeding and exhibiting all kinds of breaching, rolling, tail lobs, pec slaps, etc - basically "partying and showing off"!

Not quite light, at
5 am
, we awoke and went outside to hear lots of
orca blows
, couldn't even see who, going N in
Haro Strait
, just north of Bellevue Pt. Sea was still and quiet, but when the wind got cold at
5:30 we went back to bed. Up again at 6, more blows, they were fishing. There were a few breaches and spyhops.
