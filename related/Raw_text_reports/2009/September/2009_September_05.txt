Orca Sightings for September 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about
1 pm
we saw three
Orca
whales, it looked like 2 adults and a baby. I couldn't say if any of the fins was large enough for one to be a male. They were in Rocky Bay at the North end of
Case Inlet
on the Sound (Lat: 47.3581504 Long: -122.7943054). They were making a lot of splashing initially, but then they hung around for about half an hour in roughly the same area and seemed more to be playing. Lots of fins in the air coming up for air and going under, but not really moving from their location. As they left they appeared to be heading South.

These pictures were taken about
noon
. They were north of Heron Island in
Case Inlet
. We thought there were 4, 2 adults and 2 young, and feeding. We watched them about half of an hour then they disappeared, we suspected to the south.

Ken Balcomb, Stewart Macintyre, Kathy Babiak, John Walker and Marjoleine Roos of the Center for Whale Research encountered
L7 and L53
off Battleship Rock heading north at

4:05 p.m.
The J17's and a few K's were also encountered spread out traveling north. The encounter enfed at
4:52 p.m. off Stuart Island.

We saw the south sound
Transients
beginning just before
3 p.m.
for about 20 minutes, we watched them cruising and playing in
Case Inlet
. Our cabin on Crescent Beach is just north of Dutcher's cove, about 2 miles south of Vaughn. The whales were about a half mile off shore, between Dutcher's cove and the south end of Stretch Island. We watched them as they headed south, until they were near the ferry dock on the east side of Herron Island. They were quite a distance away by then, but it appeared they stopped the ferry to watch the whales too.

Orca Network received a report of a pod of
4-5 orcas
in
Case Inlet
outside of Vaughan, near Rocky Bay around
1 or 2 pm
, heading south.
*
Once the [orcas] decided to head to
Lime Kiln Point
, across a strong flooding tide, they really put on the speed. At about

1:45pm
all of a sudden, it seemed, there they were- breaching multiple times by multiple whales!! A few spy hops, directional changes back and forth in front the lighthouse, and a ?dozen or so L-Pod whales? continued on their way north. There was a second group at Point Edwards that looked like they might head north, but at

3:40pm
they headed south.

Orcas
heard on
Orca Sound hydrophones
starting at
20:20 (

8:20 pm
). The calls lasted only about 10 minutes, then they moved to
Lime Kiln hydrophones
at

20:45
, where they lasted about 20 minutes.Seems like they had 'stopped by' the lighthouse (really-really- loud) for a few minutes and then began to move off. As they did, I continued to hear their calls, and each call would 'keep going, and going.' The calls did NOT sound like they were echoing back. It was like being able to 'see' how far their calls carry. (at about
21:06). It was quite amazing. It also seemed to be a small group, and it seemed as if they were having a 'casual conversation.' It was very different from what I usually hear.

I just had a call (
7:15 pm) from relatives staying at the family cabin on
Johnson Point
, out of Olympia. They were watching
5 orcas
heading south. The orcas were about a fourth of the way out into the channel between the area south of Tolmie State Park and Taylor Bay. Feeding must be good.

Orcas
in
Hammersley Inlet
in the Shelton area.
