J, K, and L pods
were reported in the morning heading east past Trial Island. Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Astrid van Ginnekin and Stefan Jacobs, and Ken Balcomb encountered K's and L's at

10:26 a.m.
in mid
Haro Strait
off False Bay (48째 26.468 N, 123째 08.993 W). Once the whales reached the west side of San Juan Island they spread out and headed north. We later found J's off Kellett Bluff as well as more L's. The encounter ended off Turn Point (48째 41.095 N, 123째 14.764 W) at
2:19 p.m. The whales continued north toward Swanson Channel.

I was kayaking yesterday "09-11" and saw a pod of
five orcas
it was around
five p.m
. The whales were about half mile south of Joemma State Park "its on the westside of Key Peninsula" and headed toward
Gig harbor
. The whales were just cursing in the water, I saw the pod surface two times but no one came out of the water. Looks like they were just heading back to open water.

I was on the
5 pm
out of
Tsawwassen BC
to Swartz Bay, and the ferry was setting up to enter
Active Pass
. The Captain announced "
orcas
off the port bow about 2 1/2 miles away", and they were soon closer, on the starborad side, and then more following, spread out, on the port side. They were moving right along and of course the ferry was moving in the opposite direction so their speed seemed increased. From the dorsal fins it looked like there were adult males, females, children and babies, and maybe some young males.

Dorothy Hahn called to report a small pod of
5-6 orcas
between
McNeil Island and Steilacoom
.

The Ocean Magic 2 vessel out of Victoria caught up with many SR's
Orca
at
1.30pm
. They were heading north near
Turn Point
. We saw several members of J pod as well as this large group of L's.

We came up to Turn Point on Stuart Island just as the
orcas
shot off of it and across
Boundary Pass
. There were two large groups with a few other SRKWs spread around and we watched as they tail-slapped and lobbed and breached numerous times. Especially around a research boat that was traveling right alongside the pod taking breath samples. The orcas were moving in very close formation at a quick speed, not seeming to waste time on feeding or milling. They headed up Swanson Channel and were still moving northwest when we left them at
1515
hours.

From
Hannah Heights
on W. San Juan Island, we observed a pod of 8-10
orcas
, including several adult males, about 5 miles out between Discovery Island and Salmon Bank, heading SE at

10:15 am
. Then we noticed more spouts beyond this group, and then suddenly by 11, there were whales spread out everywhere, some closer in. From 11 -
11:30 we observed part of J pod heading N past Hannah Heights, fairly close in. At
11:40, 2 more orcas came by, foraging and heading north, then turning and heading back south. At noon, there was a large pod offshore again, and another pod closer in further south of Hannah Heights.

A pod of
killer whales
passed in front of our house today at

5:00 pm
. Our location is: Key Peninsula, west looking across
Case Inlet
, toward Hartstien Island, north of tip of Herron Island.There were at least four and they were headed North to South and passed between Hartstien and Herron Island.

The 5
orcas
in south sound were in
Dana Passage
at about

10:30 am
. We watched the orcas travel north all the way to Case Inlet around Treasure Is. During this time they fed at Wilson Pt. on Harstene Is. After feeding they stopped and put on a show at the North Point at Harstene Is. This lasted about 45 min, they were very active during this time. They then headed north into Case Inlet around 2 pm.
