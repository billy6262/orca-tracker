I was on the Western Prince and we saw
Southern Residents
at Village Pt.,
Lummi Island
. They were heading north. In the
morning
I had heard there were whales at the south end of Rosario St. and I assumed that is was J and K pods and L-7, L-53 and L-87 who are now common visitors with Js and Ks. But I was very surprised when the first whales we saw were the L-2s - Grace L-2, Gaia L-78 and Wave Walker L-88. There was a large group way ahead and they were the L-9s - Tanya L-5, Flash L-73, Saanich L-74 and Nyssa L-84 and the L-35s - Ino L- 54, Indigo L-100 and Coho L-54. Throughout the encounter we saw representatives of the following groups: L-43s (Racer L-72 and Fluke L-105), the L-4s (Kasatka L-82), and the L-26s (Baba L-26 and Crewser L-92). The L-21s - Marina L-47, Moonlight L-83, Midnight L-110 and Muncher L-91 were traveling with The Cookies - the J-22s - Oreo J-22, DoubleStuf J-34, Cookie J-38 and Rhapsody J-32. With them were Tsuchi J-31 and Mako J-39. Of course there were many many whales to the north that we did not see, we could only see their blows way in the distance.

Large
pod
traveling NE from south side of
Cypress island
around the NW point of Guemes. Several males and many mothers with calves alongside. Dorsal fin saddle marks on the large ones were brownish speckled rather than white. Many were breaching. They were stretched out with about 4-5 in the lead, about 15 in the mid section and 5-8 bringing up the rear. Some veered off and went close to shore over near Guemes.
