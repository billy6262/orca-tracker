Orca Sightings for September 15, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
My Name is Cindy Pendergraft and my husband is Mark. We were returning from a Tuna trip and noticed a pod of
orca
following us. We fish out of
Bodega Bay California
and know you're interested (poster at the boat launch) on any local info regarding these wonderful creatures.
a.. We believe there were 4 to 5 orca - We saw enough of them to know they were orca
b.. the lat. and lon. are as follows: 38.10.54, 123.30.05
c.. we were returning in a NE direction when we saw them and when they left heading E
d.Date 9/15/09 and Time was

13:12
e.. Looked like they were feeding. Lots of albatross and Jaegers (sp?) following. We had bait fish jumping by our boat. Could have been Anchovies or herring On our way out (west) this morning, we spotted some humpbacks within a mile or so of this location. This area seems to always have lots of bird, whale and dolphins activity which makes not finding the albacore easier to take.

Naomi Yoder called to report a pod of
~9 orcas
(no adult males present) about 20 miles due west of
Westport, WA
at
10 am

This young
Humpback
whale, a 3 yr old, BCZ0298, based on Mark Malleson's and the Centre for Whale Research Humpback Whale catalogue, was seen at
4pm
just off the
Victoria Harbour
near Albert Head. It delighted us all on the 3.30pm Ocean Magic by performing a spyhop and some lovely manoeuvres through a kelp bed. One could clearly see the strands of kelp draped across its rostrum. An amazing encounter with this Baleen Whale.

We had heard that J's and K's were coming past Victoria heading east. As we were approaching the scene, the whales had come through Baynes Channel, we were treated to two groups of 6-8 Dalls Porpoise, including one Hybrid. As we approached we saw a couple of consecutive spyhops in the distance then we hooked up with a few groups of 5-6 animals each (K20, K38 and a lot of generic whales) as they crossed
Haro Strait
and went directly to Lime Kiln. These groups headed north as they neared the Island and we followed them for awhile. Eventually the rest of the whales that had stayed on the Vancouver Island side began to come across Haro Strait. We saw K21, then K26 and company. Each time we tried to exit the scene there were more whales much to our delight. J27, J31 & J39 approached with J31 doing 3 huge breaches. Absolutely amazing sight in the late afternoon sun and flat calm waters. By the third breach many of our passengers had a great pictures to share. Next we were surprised by L72,L105 and L95. This meant our reports of J & K pods had turned into a
Super pod
!!! Finally we watched the K16's foraging before heading into Mosquito Pass.
