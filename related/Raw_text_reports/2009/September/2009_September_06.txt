Orca Sightings for September 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas sighted off Bells Beach on Whidbey Island

6:15 pm
. As we were rowing out to get our boat, we spotted orcas about 500 yards off shore on
Saratoga Passage
. By the time I got into our boat and headed out into the Passage, they disappeared! Disappointed, I circled around back towards the beach and spotted the Orcas just off Bells Beach (at the end of the summer homes). There were 5 beautiful Orcas and I think they were feeding. They were splashing, tail fllipping, spy hopping, and putting on quite a show!

Suddenly out of the grey mist out west, came
four Transient Orca
, T18, T19, 19B and 19C. We found them along the rugged shoreline of Vancouver Island, near
Secretary Rock
. I was on the
12.15pm
Ocean Magic 2 vessel, and despite the ugly weather we had some nice views of these animals, one of which was an unexpected surfacing fairly close to the boat.

Brenda, of
Brookings, OR
called to report
1 orca
4.5 miles out, off
Bird Island
.

I just saw 3, perhaps 4 adult
orcas
travelling fast towards the north below my house (above 'campers row' beach, north of Randall point), north of
Clinton
(east side across from Hat Island). The time was about

4:40-
4:55PM
. They were about 300 feet off shore and too far to pick up distinguishing characteristics. Myrna Twomey had called at
4:35PM to tell me they were headed my way - she and her eagle-eyed son saw 5 distinct spouts passing Randall Point. Addendum: They evidently had passed Sandy Point by
5:20PM. I found them (or three others? nah.) about 200 feet offshore of the Langley marina at about
5:35PM. Don't know how long they had been in vicinity. Observed them feeding for about 10-15 minutes; they were no longer travelling. At about

5:50PM
they all sounded and I never picked them up after that, though I scanned until about
6:15PM (we hate it when that happens - but that's Transients for you!). No boats or other disturbing conditions were evident at the time they disappeared. All dorsals were about the same height. There were definitely three adult individuals.

I just raced to the beach as a single
Orca
went by in front of our house on
Brighton Beach
, Clinton, Whidbey Island,

4:46 pm
, in the middle of the channel and swimming at a fast pace. He/she was headed north. No others so far but I'm watching. I need to learn what to look for so I can identify a resident or transient whale.

Orca Network received a report from Laura Nance of
~5 orcas
off
Possession Park
, S. Whidbey Island, heading north up Possesesion Sound toward Glendale (Clinton). They had circled around off the boat ramp for 15 mins, then headed north.
*
I saw 4 [
orcas
], traveling slowly north toward Brace point (S. Seattle) at

9:15 am
.

Maureen Frederick of
Powell River
, B.C. called at

2:42 pm
to report 1 large
orca
with a large dorsal fin, across from Harwood Island, heading north toward Savary Island.
*
Orca Network received a report of
Southern Residents
off the west side of
San Juan Island
around
11 am
this morning, heading south and "power surfing, breaching and full body porpoising out of 5 foot seas" - they LOVE this kind of weather! She had heard there were members of all 3 pods present.
