Orca Sightings for September 20, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, Astrid van Ginneken and Dan McSweeney of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J's, K's and L's
, spread out off
Lime Kiln State Park
(48째 29.654 N; 123째 08.953 W) at

4:36 p.m
. The whales were milling and traveling slowly north. The encounter ended just off Kellett bluff (48째 31.797 N; 123째 09.996 W) at
6:11 p.m. The whales were still spread out in loose groups and heading north.

At sea I thought there were only 4 (
orcas
), but my photos indicate potentially five according to my comparisons. I trust that experts might come up with a different number! These animals were seen around noon over the Noyo Canyon offshore a little over 15 nautical miles offshore from
Fort Bragg, CA
. We first encountered them just after noon at N 39 730; 33' 01" W 124 730; 07' 23" and they stayed with us for 15 minutes and we last saw them at N 39 730; 31' 52" W 124 730; 06' 43". I understand that just a couple of weeks prior a murrelet survey crew saw what very possibly could have been the same group off of Redwood creek in Humboldt County last month.

The five
transients
(who have been down here for the past few weeks) were sighted at
8pm
in Sanderson Cove at the mouth of
Eld Inlet
. Report from Kim Merriman of Olympia.

At

9:00 a.m
. we saw a group of 5 (?)
orcas
passing through, between
Johnson Pt
. and Anderson Island. They were cruising pretty fast towards Nisqually River delta.

The pod of
transient orcas
went by our place on the southeast side of
Harstene Is
. on Dana Passage around

7:30am
, heading north. A couple of them were spyhopping while going past.

The orcas were back again around

7:00
. The orcas were here at high tide and were trying to go down into
Eld Inlet
- which seems to be a favorite place recently. They only got about 2000 feet into the inlet and then were "sandwiched" by two boats that ended up only being about 100 feet apart - with several in the pod in between them. Shortly afterward, the orcas turned around and headed out of the inlet. We listened to them for a long time - as they were moving rather slowly and methodically after they cleared Cooper Point.

18:48
- Still hearing
calls
, clicks, whistles -- some faint, some pretty loud -- on
Lime Kiln
(but not Orcasound) now and for the last 15 minutes. Maybe fading out, overall.

16:52
- Nice
clicks
on
Lime Kiln
hydrophone but no vocals just yet. Very spread out and heading N at the moment. Oh just heard fist calls

17:00
.

15:45
-
Orcas
in resting pattern slowly going northward. No vocalizing at all.

The Resident Killer Whales (or
Orcas
) were moving south from Rosario Strait around
Lopez Island
. We came through Cattle Pass and were ahead of the Orcas, so we positioned ourselves offshore of the whales so we could parallel them in Haro Strait off the south end of San Juan Island. A tight group in the lead, maybe 6 to 8 Orcas including J1 (Ruffles). Then a single Orca K12 (Sequim) swimming; a few hundred yards behind her was K11 (Georgia) who was rolling on her side swimming just beneath the surface. Next in the parade was most of Skagit's (K13) family. Now I get really excited about baby Orcas, which anyone on the boat would know by my enthusiastic squeals! We had a great look at little 1-year-old K42 with older brother Lobo K26 (his dorsal fin is huge) and sibling K36, mom K14 and aunt K16...I'm assuming 7-year-old K35 (Sonata) was there as well. The family was changing direction a bit - a lot of Orcas seemed to be foraging off of
South Beach
. Then we were surprised by J26 (Mike) who was swimming near mom J16 (Slick) with 2 year-old J42! Remaining shutdown, so as not to create any excess noise or risk disturbing the Orcas, we waited until they were far enough away to start up. The water was so calm and clear we had the special treat to view Mike underwater as he swam by. It is not everyday that we see this. Very awe- inspiring to watch an Orca gracefully swim underwater, then surface to breathe. Wow. We left all feeling a little humbled by the experience. It was time to move on to view other wildlife.
