Orca Sightings for September 3, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Right as I drove around the corner at Point Edwards at

4:55pm
, around slack flood tide, there were
orcas
traveling near shore from
Lime Kiln Point
south!

Amy Traxler of the Whale Museum called to share two reports from their hotline of the
Transient orcas
in south Puget Sound. One sighting was between Eagle Pt. and Munson Pt.
*
While tuna fishing we sighted
10 killer whales
about 28 miles off shore. 3 females with calves, two males and two other whales, either juvenile males or females without calves. These two whales had small dorsal fins and were traveling along side a large male who's dorsal fin was bent over to the left (T40?) . Approx 20 inches was folded over with what appeared to be a lump on the end of the dorsal. Another male was traveling approx 100 yards away from the rest of the pod. The whales were traveling south at a very steady speed. Location as follows: South west of Port Orford and North West of
Gold Beach Oregon
(42.39.280 by 124.58.975). The whales were in good health including the calves, what a treat to see them.

The
12.15pm
Ocean Magic 2 vessel went west to encounter two
Transient
Orca off Sooke Vancouver Island. They were T 11 and T 11A. ID by Mark Malleson. Great to see them in a resting phase slowly heading out west.

Most of the members of
L pod
and some of
K pod
were spread along the west side and south end of
San Juan Island
at

2:30 P.M.
They were traveling east in several tight groups, porpoising along the way.

An amazing day today with
J's and L's
! We got them in the
strait of georgia
and followed them all the way just outside of the (Vancouver) airport. When we first arrived there was lots of foraging going on but then the fun began, non stop breaches, tail and pec slaps, spyhops. It was a great day for all of us. This is a picture of J1 spyhopping with UBC in the background and a plane landing at the airport.

Our
Southern Residents
were having fun near
Horseshoe Bay, North Vancouver
, mid-
afternoon
(a bonus for BC ferry passengers perhaps). Various members of J, K and L pods, including 'Ruffles' (J1) and 'Blackberry' (J27), were highly active - breaches, spy-hops, tail-lobs, porpoising and some 'hanky-panky'! A real treat for everyone who was lucky enough to see the Orcas today.

Apparently the [
orcas
] somehow managed to turn around, come all the way back in, and no one saw/heard them until they passed the Center (for Whale Research, NW
San Juan Island
). They thought they saw 7-9 L Pod whales, and it wasn't until the whales had gone through Active Pass that we found that we had members of all three pods. Then another boat was transiting to San Juan and found a few K Pod whales and the L12s down at McArthur Bank.

Orca Network received a call from Genevieve, reporting
2 orcas
observed just past the breakers from
Kalaloch lodge, WA
coast just before sunset. The whales were milling, possibly feeding, & not heading in any discernable direction.
*

7:45 AM
, Saw a
minke
whale in
Saltery Bay, B.C.

I was just at my sisters in
Hamersley Inlet
, in Shelton. Her neighbor had taken pictures of the
Transient
orca pod.
Deborah Goelzer
*
I saw three
orcas
in
Case Inlet
on the east side of Harstine Island at about

6:20p
. Two adults and one juvenile were heading north. I watched them breach for about 2-3 minutes before they headed north toward Stretch Island.

We got reports of these whales (
Transient orcas
) early this morning, so Greg Schorr and I just went out to get a better look. There are five individuals in the group, 3 adult female/subadult male sized and two juveniles, one fairly small. We saw at least two kills- one confirmed harbor seal and one that we assume was a seal, but we were at a distance so did not see the victim. We left the whales in the middle of
Budd Inlet
, headed slowly south toward Olympia. A WDFW enforcement team is on the water keeping an eye on them, and they said they will be around as long as the whales remain in the area. And that's the latest from the south sound!

I assume that you are getting all the whale reports from South Sound. They (
Transient orcas
) were in
Eld Inlet
near Cooper Point about

11:45 am
today. gobbling up the seals.

10:45 am - 3 Orcas, Budd Inlet
(Olympia, WA), 1500' south of Boston Harbor Lighthouse, East side of inlet. Boats starting to gather.
