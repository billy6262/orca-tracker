Orca Sightings for September 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Long time Center for Whale Research volunteer, Stewart Macintyre, spotted
transients
from the Center for Whale Research at

1:00 p.m
. a few miles SW of Zero Rock. At
1:51 we encountered the T18's (T18, T19, T19B, and T19C) three miles NE of Baynes Channel (48° 29.633 N,123° 13.893 W). The whales attacked and killed a harbor seal and then grouped up and headed SW toward
Discovery Island, B.C.
(48° 29.317 N,123° 13.402 W) at
2:50 pm. From the photos taken we were able to confirm that T19C is a male. Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich, Astrid Van Ginnekin, and Stewart Macintyre on Orca; Ken Balcomb, Marjoleine Roos and Tiffany Humphrey on Starlet

We haven't seen many
Dall's porpoise
this season, so finding 3 groups of porpoise out in
Haro Strait
off of Spieden Island was a welcome sight. One group of 5 rode our bow and stern wakes from

2:55pm until
3:10pm
, when they went back to traveling- foraging. Our passengers were awed by their agility, speed, and grace!

This is a report of a pod of
orcas
that arrived in
Hammersley Inlet
by Shelton, WA. The pod consists of five orcas, 4 adults and one baby. They swim back and forth sometimes in a row and other times clustered together. There is one wide open area by the Shelton Yacht Club where they spend hours each day flopping and tail splashing, leaping out of the water and rolling over. At high tide they rush down the inlet like they are feeding? Acting very intent in their movement. We have a number of photos of orcas leaping out of the water and some shots of the fins. We live on Walker Park Road outside of Shelton and they swim around our house
several times each day
. There are annual sightings around this time of year of one or two orcas but never more than a few hours then they are gone. They have NEVER in 30 years stayed this long in this area.

We were lucky enough last night to catch 3-4
Transients
passing through Baynes channel and the Chain Islands at about
1630
, they then headed out to meet the reported group of T's east of
Constance Bank
, then they all hightailed it west (we weren't lucky enough to catch the big group but I heard that there may have been around 30 animals).

Bill Parker called Orca Network to report observing
1 Gray whale
off the
Sequim
, Clallam County Dungeness Recreation area, 30 yards off shore of the first parking lot at
4 pm
. The whale appeared to be feeding, and had a light colored area around its right eye.

I have to say the
Grey whales
off of Jetty Island must be quite happy to be there. Upon our return, we also saw a solo traveler heading north in the mid channel of
Admiralty Inlet
off of Double Bluff. I was surprised to see one spout upon our return to Port Gardener, as I would have thought that the whale we saw in the mid channel would have signaled that they were ready to head south for the summer.

Four
transient
orcas at Zero Rock south of
D'Arcy Island (east of Victoria)
at

2:00 P.M
. We saw several large breaches from a distance and a harbor seal was eaten while we were on scene. After the seal there was some general milling and then all of the animals headed southwest. Present were T018, T018B, T018C and T019.

On our afternoon trip we were headed southwest toward Discovery Island to check in on T18 and the T19 group when we got word of a large group of
T's
at
Constance Bank
. After a very brief stop with the first 4 transients, we elected to head further south to reduce the number of boats viewing that small group. As we neared Constance Bank, we could see lines of fins and blows appearing on the horizon in all directions. Most of our viewing was from 1/4 to 1/2 mile as it seemed there was no pattern to the movements of the lines between surfacings, and moving the boat in the direction where the whales had been last proved to be quite unproductive. After what seemed like a long wait, we finally had a group of whales close enough to ID a few of them (about 200- 300 m). The T10's were the most recognizable group at first. Although it appeared the whales were headed away from us, the next time they surfaced, they were behind our boat and moving up our starboard side. A couple of breaches were followed by some upside-down swimming, tail slaps and some general rollling around. The whales finished that breathing sequence and when they appeared again, they were at least 1/4 mile away and back to their serious selves. From a photo taken by one of our passengers, it has been determined that at least one of the whales present was a California Transient that was also seen in Alaska this summer. I have also attached another photo that I took (300 zoom and very cropped! see above photo) of a whale that is not in the catalogue and is not familiar to Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard, whose specialty is Alaskan Transients. The photo has also been forwarded to the DFO researchers at Nanaimo

. The T's that were Id'ed later from photos were T100, T100B, T100C, T10, T10B, T10C, T63 and T46. This was just the one line that approached the boat close enough to ID. All the others were just fins and blows in the distance - beautiful! It was definitely worth the extra trip to see these top predators all grouped together.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research has ID'd this whale as T46D - sb

A solitary
ocra
was sighted in Discovery Passage near Whiskey Point on
Quadra Island
, BC at

10:00 AM
this morning. It was heading south toward Cape Mudge at the south end of the island at a leisurely pace. Dorsal fin was estimated at about 4 feet. Approximate coordinates are: N 50° 02.16'; W 125° 12.92'. Two whale watching boats were following slowing behind at a safe distance.
