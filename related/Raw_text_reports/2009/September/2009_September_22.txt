Orca Sightings for September 22, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We left Cadboro Bay around
3pm
and motor sailed around to the
Victoria Waterfront
where we were greeted by a nice westerly so we got to sail the rest of the way out and viewed the
humpbacks
in between the Fairway marker and
Albert Head
. The whales were milling around going in no particular direction. As we were leaving we noticed at least
3 orcas
a little west of our location.

We were seeing
6 transient Orcas
just north of
Hartstine Island
, headed north in
Case Inlet
. There are a few good shots of dorsal fins that might allow you to I.D. some of these guys, especially the one with the two notches on the following edge of the fin. We followed them for about 1Â½ hours, headed north through Case Inlet. We didn't see any breaches of spy hops, just moving along the surface for 3-4 minutes, then deep diving and disappearing for 10 minutes or so, then re- appearing further north.

These whales were IDd by the Center for Whale Reesearch from photographs taken by Cascadia Research, as the T137's and T36A's - sb

Orca Network received a report from Katheryn Rice of Olympia, reporting 5 - 6 orcas north of
Johnson Pt
, near Olympia, WA (47 11.484 N, 122 48.220 W), heading north into Case Inlet at

12:45 pm
.

J pod
at sunset leisurely passing west side of
Lummi Island
about
7 p.m.
- we heard blows from our deck and went down to watch J pod traveling south in resting mode at sunset. Nothing more beautiful - flat calm water, moon hanging over Orcas Island, sunset, whales breathing percussively. J1 easily ID-ed from shore - 2 adult-size male fins (J26 & J27?) and another (J30?) close behind.

We caught up to resident orcas,
J and K pods
, at around
noon
, just south of
Point Roberts
, with almost glassy calm conditions. The whales were spread over miles - we could just barely see J1 way off to the south. The whales were meandering in a southeast and south direction, depending on which animals you were watching. This was definitely "kids" day, with siblings travelling together, and mom off in the distance, or nowhere in sight. The exception was J17 - she had J44 right by her side. We spent part of the encounter observing K25 (Scoter) and K34 (Cali). These brothers were definitely having a little "boy party". There was lots of rolling around, sea snakes, and lazy spyhops. At one point, it appeared K34 was being pulled backward by K25. Sister, K20 (Spock), was nearby, but keeping clear of the activity. We could hear vocals right through the hull of the boat. We finished off the orca viewing with J16's offspring frolicking together.

This orca report was forwarded by Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC:
1550
, 1 Big Male, 4 females/smaller [
orcas
], and 1 baby orca were sighted 1.5 miles west of
Moss Landing, CA
(36-47.7'N, Long 121-49.7'W), heading east. No deformed, curved, cut, or funny dorsal fins, all fins normal appearance.

As we were quite close to
Boundary Bay,
we decided to have a look for the
Gray Whale
that was rumoured to be there. It took almost a complete sweep of the bay before we spotted the Gray. So far, I have not been able to match photos to any of the 5 Grays that were in Boundary Bay this spring. Photos will be sent to Cascadia Research for their comparison. Another vessel located a second, smaller Gray whale a little further into the bay. Very unusal to have Grays around our area at this time of year.
