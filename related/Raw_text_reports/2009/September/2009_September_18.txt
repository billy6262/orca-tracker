Orca Sightings for September 18, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
A gorgeous autumn day showed
J's and L's
in
Rosario Strait
off of Lawrence Point on Orcas Island, from

2:25pm to
3:14pm
. The whales spread across the strait in several small and large groups, as they foraged south against a strong flooding current. L-22 Spirit in the lead, passed close to the Orcas shoreline, leaving us wondering where her 'boys' were. J-8 Spieden, J-19 Shachi with J- 41 Eclipse, passed a little further offshore. That's when we noticed L-22's son L-79 Skana, in hot pursuit of J-31 Tsuchi! Hot as in there was rolling, lunging, and splashing going on with L-79 showing his 'pink floyd'! The encounter went on for about 10 minutes, when L-79 headed east and J-31 continued south. Our impression was J-31 was rebuking L-79's advances! Maybe 15 to 18 months from now will tell a different ending?!

About
1 pm
, I saw
4 Orcas
in Pickering Passage (west side of
Hartstene Island
) about 1 mile north of the bridge to Hartstene. They were heading south. They surfaced and blew several times.

Thanks to Steve Jeffries for forwarding this report & photos along to Orca Network. We sent them to the Center for Whale Research, and Dave Ellifrit responded with these IDs from the photos: "T49B and T49B1 and what looks like T36A and T36A1." Coincidentally, T36A & T36A1 are two of the Transient orcas that have been enjoying an extended visit to south Puget Sound these past weeks, and T36A was the orca tagged by researchers
!

Resident
orcas
were spotted in the southern
Strait of Georgia
late morning (after
11 AM
). By the time we caught up to the orcas at about
12:30, they were passing by Matia Island. As the whales continued in a south or southeasterly direction beyond Matia Island, they spread out into several smaller groups. There were many surface active behaviours observed, including, breaches, spyhops, cartwheels, tail lobs and much upside- down swimming by the males.
J Pod and K Pod
were present, along with at least a few males from
L Pod
. We left the whales at approximately

1:30 PM
, heading southeast towards Lummi Island, with Mt Baker as a gorgeous backdrop.

I live on
Case Inlet
, across from Harstine Island and just south of Herron Island. Last evening around

5:30 pm
, I spotted
6-8 orcas
swimming south, out of the inlet towards the Narrows. They were moving very fast, dipping in and out of the water, spraying water.
