Orca Sightings for September 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
The [
orca
] sighting was in the GPS location of 47 degrees 14" N 122 degrees 34" W at the time span of

13:55 pm
we first spotted them swimming around and doing casual whale maneuvers of spyhopping and tails high surfacing and blowing breath and looking around then hunting a baby seal. They quite curiously swam all around our boat and dove under us as well as near two other power boats in the near vicinity. We saw them continue on towards the
Fox Is
. bridge area at
14:30pm. At that time one of the largest adults breached totally out of the water quite near to a private dock ramp and floating docks close to the shore of Fox Is. We then continued on home to Longbranch via water between Fox Is. and McNeill Is. we did not spot the whales again.

Around
2-
3:30pm
near Pt. Fosdick and
Fox Is
. in the south Sound a group of
orcas
7-8 in number. At least 3-4 adults and 4 young. One of the young orcas seemed to be a very new baby. They were playing? and hunting and feeding. A baby seal was being taunted and hunted. The adults were teaching the young how to hunt. We watched and I took pics for over an hour. They were last heading towards the Fox Is. bridge area on Sunday.

I want to report 1
Gray Whale
in the Straits of
Juan de Fuca
. The whale was feeding in the kelp beds just east of Seal & Sail Rocks. We also saw what we think might have been a
Minke
Whale in the same vicinity but it was closer to shore feeding at sunset.

Five
orcas
were sighted in Discovery Passage near Whiskey Point on
Quadra Island, BC
at

13:40
today. They were heading North toward Quathiaski Cove at a good pace about 700-800 meters off the shore and parallel to a group of about fifteen dolphins which were moving north about 150-200 meters off shore. The dolphins were well dispersed over a large area. As the orcas got closer to Whiskey Point they appeared to be moving in behind the dolphins. Dorsal fin of largest was estimated to be between 3-4 feet. Approximate coordinates are: N 50° 02.09'; W 125° 12.93'
