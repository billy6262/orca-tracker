Orca Sightings for September 28, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bit of a bumpy trip out toward
Hein Bank
, where
orcas
from all three pods foraging as they headed southeast across a strong flooding current, from about

1:20pm to 2pm
. Multiple breaches, a cartwheel, and a 2 second headstand (flukes held in the air), by some of the youngsters distracted us from the confused seas!

We met with the
resident orcas
north of
Hein Bank
at approx.

1:30 PM
. Throughout our encounter, we observed almost every type of behaviour. The J4 matriline, plus J17 (Princess Angeline) and family were resting their way through the big waves. J1 (Ruffles) was accompanied by L7 (Canuck) and L53 (Lulu), followed by J30 (Riptide). This little group was very active, with cartwheels, spyhops, breaches (even 1 double side-by-side breach by L7 and L53) between long underwater intervals. The fellows were doing alot of upside down swimming, showing off their stuff. As our encounter was nearing its end, little J45 began a series of repetitive breaches, clearing the water on most of them. More whales could be seen off in the distance in almost every direction, milling and socializing. On our return trip, several small groups of Dall's Porpoise were sighted south and west of False Bay, heading southbound.

0750 Orca

Lime Kiln
. I hear Orca way off in the back ground. Orca sounds = 2 to 4, Man made noise = 0, Sea state noise = 2.

7:28 am
- After Robo reported a call, there was over a half hour of silence. Now lots of S-1
calls
and clicks being heard at
Lime Kiln
.

A little further out near
Hein Bank
we met up with the
Orcas
once again. Some nice breaches, half breaching- spyhops, and frequent directional changes. More foraging behavior. A large mass of birds hovered above a small group of Orcas awaiting any scraps they could find.

01:10 am
- About 5 minutes ago began hearing whistles and
calls
on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
that sound like Transients to me. Began recording at
01:13 PDT. Now nice clear calls and whistles. Will post recording to OrcaSound once they've passed.

Wanted to let you know that we saw from 50-60
offshore killer whales
in
Monterey Bay CA
. They were first sighted in Carmel Bay, then headed south at a slow pace but very spread out, we followed for a few hours. Recognized many of the known animals including the one with chopped off fin. Many young, and were active at times, with tail slaps and belly up swimming. CA temp #s (N107, which is juv of N104) new since our catalog so temp "new" numbers, seen a few times in Monterey since 04. I was out that day as well and recognized the others in group. And, thanks Steve for photos of the chopped fin group, yes we had numbers of 216 which again are temporary until we update the catalog, very soon hopefully and we will have a very complete catalog, since last one in 97.
