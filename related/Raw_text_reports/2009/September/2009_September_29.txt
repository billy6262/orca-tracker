Orca Sightings for September 29, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just returned from Sidney on the ferry and saw
T19B
and three or four others off
Shaw Island
west shore heading south at
1340
today. Got a few long-shot pics from the ferry.

Despite the rain, we did our best to track a group of
transient orcas
in
San Juan Channel
at Turn Island. There were 5-6 animals that were identified as the
T19s
by another boat. Their foraging pattern was very spread out and random, so we spent a lot of time motoring back and forth. There was at least one kill made while we were on scene, but the victim was unidentified as to species. We left the area at
1515
hours as the animals were heading south down the channel.
