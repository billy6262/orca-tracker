Orca Sightings for October 1, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Have you heard anything about an
orca pod
sighted from the Coho, about halfway between
Victoria and Port Angeles
, the ferry was running late so maybe it was

11:30 or

11:45
- And also "a much bigger whale".
Miriam B, jealous in Port Angeles
