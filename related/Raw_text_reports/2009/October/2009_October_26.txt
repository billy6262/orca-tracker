Orca Sightings for October 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had an early start and had been fortunate to hear whales on the hydrophones (OrcaSound.net) from San Juan Island before leaving dock. We met up with about 30 whales from
L Pod
just rounding Turn Point into
Boundary Pass
at approximately

10:30 AM
. A small group of Dall's Porpoise were also in the area, but left rather quickly as L Pod approached. The whales were in slow travel/resting mode, in 3 loose groups. The interesting thing was that they were not necessarily grouped by matrilines and several seemed to be more age-segregated than by family. The matrilines observed were L26's, L37's, L4's, L21's, L9's, and L35's. It was incredibly quiet in Boundary Pass, no freighters, and we were the only vessel with the whales until the Maple Leaf sailboat glided up. We left the whales at
11:15 AM, still headed eastbound in Boundary Pass near Blunden Island. A photo of one group is attached (300mm zoom and cropped). It was a very peaceful and beautiful orca encounter, with whale blows hanging in the cool, fall air.
