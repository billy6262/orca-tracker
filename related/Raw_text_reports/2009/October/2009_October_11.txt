Orca Sightings for October 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was just reading the Kitsap Sun about
L Pod
and the new baby seen off Port Townsend. I was taking the
3.00pm
Ferry to Bremerton saw a Pod off
Bainbridge Island
heading across the Sound.

This is from the Beam Reach Board Chair, Mike Dougherty, who saw the [
orcas
] going north from his
Ballard
home at

16:38
: "I would definitely say it was a very large group, certainly at least 35 individuals as you reported. Very spread out - some quite close to our side, others very close to Bainbridge and quite spread out north/south as well. Generally traveling north, but there was also a good bit of milling, and there were individuals hanging out pretty much right in front of the house (perhaps due to the freshwater exit near the locks) for at least 1 hour. Saw some breaching, but mostly just traveling & milling."

We saw numerous
Orca
Whales on the eastern edge of the northbound traffic lanes just between
Alki
point and the yellow separation zone marker that lies north of Blake Island around
3pm
. We saw 9 dorsals out of the water simultaneously near us so we took the boat out of gear. It appeared that there were more than that in the area. They traveled north for about 10 minutes and then began to travel westbound. They went down for a bit and a large number reappeared much further west and appeared to be headed toward Eagle Harbor and they were nearing mid channel of Puget Sound. It looked like the ferry from Bainbridge to Seattle had to stop for a large number of them for a period of time. Meanwhile we saw two more in the middle of of Elliott Bay and two more smaller ones rise under the bow of our boat while we were just north of Alki Point. They spent a lot of time on the surface and they were in our sight for over well over an hour while we were in the area. Earlier, Seattle marine traffic had been reporting that there was more than one pod in the area. Some reports were in the vicinity of Eagle Harbor, south of West Point and north of Blake Island.

Spotted 15-16 member
pod
on
colvos
passage

1:30
. There looked to be 4-5 young members and 1-2 were real young. The pod was so huge that they spread from one side to the other coming up the passage with the young favoring the west side to frolic. If you look close at the first photo you will see one of the youngest learning to breach. The other shot shows how close they were to us - I'd say within 60-80ft from us.

We saw 8-12
orca
traveling north about

1:30 PM
in
Colvos Passage
. They were due east from Fragaria (south of Southworth, north of Olalla) on the Peninsula side. They were traveling at a good pace, not milling about.

Near

6:00-
6:30 pm orcas
Northbound near Spring Beach, just north of
Shilshole
Marina. 27-30 individuals spread out from the shipping lanes to the Â½ mile off eastern shore. Breaching, tail slaps. One mother/calf pairing seen. One group swimming 8 in a row, synchronized. Definitely a few large males.

We had the great fortune of seeing at least one pod of
orcas
when crossing from downtown
Seattle to Bainbridge Island
on the state ferry system. They were on the north side of the boat within 5 or 10 minutes of leaving downtown and we could see what seemed like at least 10 blowing and coming in and out of the water. Gorgeous! As we approached the island, we could still see them closer to downtown in the distance and then there were suddenly a handful more just off the tip of Bainbridge.

Robert Miner called at
2 pm
to report
~15 orcas
heading north up
Colvos Passage
, 1.5 miles south of Southworth.
*
Several
Orcas
(estimate of 2 dozen) were sighted by many as they traveled north in
Colvos passage
. Several boats were observing the migration between Southworth and the northern tip of Vashon.
David Brinkerhoff
*
Directly off Prospect Point (
Olalla
), somewhere between 20-30
Orca
and closer to 30, both male and female, traveling north,

1:15pm
. The last group that was nearer us had 8 or 9 in it. They were traveling, some breaching and tail slapping.

Marilyn Dahlheim called to say her husband Bob saw lots and lots of [
orcas
] from a Crowley tugboat at

7:50 pm
. They were just south of the
Edmonds/Kingston
ferry crossing, and the whales were heading north, very actively jumping, breaching, etc. Another skipper had observed the whales off Seattle earlier in the day.
*
Was very surprised to see [
orcas
] off of North Beach today (just north of
Ballard
). At least 6 Orcas I believe, were north of North beach, traveling NE at

6:30PM
(just before dark). They seemed to be playing.

Eric from Seattle called at

4:25 pm
to report
orcas
off the
Elliott Bay Marina
. An adult and calf had just passed their boat, heading north, more orcas were over near
Bainbridge Island
and more were coming from the south.
*
Suddenly found ourselves among at least a dozen
orcas
moving north just outside of
Elliot Bay
at

4:30 PM
. First one surfaced only ten feet of our stern and the main group then surfaced of the bow. Appeared they were feeding, as several turned briefly back south and tarried before the pod again moved north along the Magnolia bluff. Wide variety of sizes, including what appeared to be a few calves who always surfaced with mothers.

4:14 pm
: 2 groups of
orcas
just south of
west pt & passing eagle
harbor going north. Hearing great vocals on hydrophone at

4:42 - with J pod. At

5:28 pm
, orcas off
Shilshole
, northbound at about 8 knots.

At about

3:00 -
3:30 pm
today, there were a bunch of
orcas
(too far away to ID), looked like multiple pods, moving along at a rapid pace while feeding as they passed west
Seattle/Alki
. There was a white boat tracking them and lots of people stopping to watch. Fun!

About 5-7
orca
spread over a line about 1/2 mile long, heading north, being seen right now (

2:49 pm
) between
West Seattle and Manchester
, approaching SE corner of Bainbridge. They're about 1.5 miles off of Manchester. No ID possible, but plenty of splashes and the occasional breech. A second group of about the same size is now (
2:57 pm) being seen about 2 miles off of West Seattle (Mid-channel, approximately), heading north. This group is about 1.5 miles south of the first one reported a little while ago.

We run a news website in West Seattle and got a tip from Jeff Hogan today that orcas were heading north from Southworth. Went down to open shoreline south of
Alki Point
(caught sight of them from Constellation Park from
~

2:45 -
3:45 pm
) and, although they were closer to Bainbridge than to West Seattle, managed to zoom in enough to get about a minute of video. Hard to count while you're shooting but as you can see in the clip, at least half a dozen or so.

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at

11:34 am
to report seeing at least 15 - 20 orcas off
Pt. Defiance
. By noon they were heading up
Colvos Passage
, at
12:55 pm they were off Lisa Beula, still heading north.
2:45 pm they were off Blake Island heading north, closer to the Kitsap side of the water. They were breaching right off the Southworth Ferry. She saw at least 30+ whales, including several calves.
*
While waiting to depart
Blake Island
and return to Seattle at

2:30 PM
on the Argosy Tillicum Village Boat we spotted a group of Orcas passing from our right to left heading north. After delaying our departure for some time to allow the Orcas to pass, several other groups of Orcas passed (also heading in a Northerly direction) as we traveled from Blake towards West Seattle. I would estimate that in all we saw several dozen Orcas. We witnessed multiple breaching behaviors by both juveniles and adults in several of the groups as they passed. Quite a treat to see this all within sight of the Seattle skyline!

We have just seen around 30-50
orcas
pass between
Vashon Island
and Olalla around

1:15 p.m.
on a beautiful, sunny Sunday afternoon.

About
10am
there were about 12 orcas. They were about 1/2 mile north of the
Narrows Bridge
. They were headed (slowly) in a north/northwest direction. I did observe one or more which seemed to have much larger fins on their back than the other orca.

A pod of ten or more
orcas
east of
Fox Island
, south of the
Narrows Bridge
about

9:00 a.m.
We viewed the pod from our University Place home, which is just north of Chamber's Bay Golf Complex. First, they were traveling south in a group. Then they broke up somewhat off the southern tip of Fox Island, which seems to be a good fishing ground for fisherman. They regrouped shortly thereafter and were heading north.

We did find five
humpbacks
around
constance bank
at
3pm
. They were pretty active with lots of tail and pec slaps, a few spyhops and a cartwheel!

How do I describe the pure magic of an encounter with
Humpback Whales
. One could see deep into the water as the plankton bloom was low. There were five Humpback Whales south east of
Constance Bank
around
1.00pm
. Three were off by themselves and two others frolicking with a bunch of playful Steller sea lions. They were having a rare old time, fluke and flipper slapping. Then all of a sudden the humpies were right at our stern of the Ocean Magic. They were as curious about us as we were of them. Those of us on board were spell bound. I was so amazed just looking down at the sheer size of these behemoths floating quietly around us. They would roll and turn upside down, then disappear beneath the boat. There was no escape for us for they went beneath us many times and surfaced forward and aft, port and starboard. We could see them so clearly below the surface, because of the clarity of the water. Every barnacle and the immense size of their pectoral flippers, which one doesn't generally see when they are foraging in textured water were visible. These animals were having fun and didn't appear interested in feeding even though one sea lion had fish hanging from its mouth. They just kept circling us, eventually after 15 mins headed off to join the sea lions once again. This was an experience that will last a lifetime.
