We located a lone
Humpback
several miles west of
Albert Head
that was milling around over a large area, zig zagging out towards Race Rocks, dives were between 8-12 minutes so it covered a lot of distance while down. While out we on the water we also viewed a couple of sea lions, seals, at least a half dozen Dall's porpoise, a couple of harbor porpoise and the biggest flock of birds on a bait ball that I have ever seen around here.

J Pod
came steaming down the west side of
Henry and San Juan Island late morning
just as I was headed down to the boat. By the time we all got onto the boat and out onto the waters of Haro Strait they were to the Lime Kiln Lighthouse.

Blackberry,
J27
paused at the stern end of the Ocean Magic today at
2.30pm
, and gave us a sweet pic of a spyhop. I saw
J1
and
J2
traveling together. L7 with her distinct tear in the top third of her dorsal fin, was traveling with Ruffles, and Granny. Interesting!
K11
, swam past too so it appeared there were members of all three Southern Resident pods off
San Juan Island
this
afternoon
. Some were well off shore of San Juan Island at Eagle Point and milling around. They were well spread out, although at other times we seemed to be surrounded.

, heading west; and So. Resident orcas 5 nautical milies

The
Orcas
were first seen coming south from Henry Island in
Haro Strait
. We met them off of Eagle Point. They were very spread out, lots of foraging going on and very long dives of 5 or more minutes. A mix of Killer Whales today - members of
J & K pod
- with L87 apparently being out there as well. We left them as they continued to move offshore.
