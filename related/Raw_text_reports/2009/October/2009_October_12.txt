Orca Sightings for October 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm still working my way through "unusual"
sounds
that were automatically detected by Val's WhoListener software. I hear calls in a file recorded at

01:32:47 this morning
. There was also a detection of a nice clear S2 when the
KWs
came through
Admiralty Inlet
on their way downsound Saturday, 10/11.
