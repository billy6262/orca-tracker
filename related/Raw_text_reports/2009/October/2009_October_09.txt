Orca Sightings for October 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
In response to yesterday's report of a
Minke
off
Rocky Pt, CA
: I did my master's work off the coast of california (the late 1980's), and rocky point was a minke hot spot (well - spot) - great news that they are still there. i was out today (Oct 9), looking for minke whales off San Francisco in my research boat, the R/V Eleanor M. I went out to the Farallon Islands (26 miles west of San Francisco) and ran into about 20 feeding humpback whales. photos were taken for John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research. One humpback did not have a dorsal fin. i will post photographs soon.

Haro strait
I mile north of San Juan County Park. Two groups of about 8 or 9
Orca
and about as many more spread out passed by around
2pm
. They were very active with several breaches spy hops and lots of tail slaps.

Besides
J and Ks
traveling north up
Haro Strait
, I was able to photograph (see my blog here for photos) most of the L pod whales that have been with J Pod and K Pod (minus the K-11s of course). These are the same L pod whales that had been in Blackfish Sound, then showed up in San Juan Channel on Tuesday and who met up with Js and Ks later, on Tuesday. They have been traveling together ever since they met up, so I wonder if the L pod whales at Race Rocks today are the rest of L pod - the L-12s, L-9 and L-35? can't wait to find out! and maybe even the K-11s???

2010
PDT - Well the Orcas are still at it. Lots of neat calls and sounds. You can hear sound echoing up and down the deep channel - the echos are over 3 sec. long. At this time the sounds are fading in and out - great session and recording.
2105
PDT - Orcas still hanging out at Orcasound. They almost sound like Humpbacks - no real calls - just little Orca sounds - continuosly.
