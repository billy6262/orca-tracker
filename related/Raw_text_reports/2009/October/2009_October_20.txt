Orca Sightings for October 20, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas
at
eastern bank
southbound!!
0950
They could be getting close to Protection Island by now.

1:58 pm
: (So. Residents) terrorizing a minke again! west of Partridge Bank, turning south at
2:20 pm. An orange calf was in the group, and other boats suggested they had seen Ls in the mix, but closer inspection revealed only J and K pod whales. Left J1 at Lagoon Point when the light failed.

When we got notice of the [
orcas
] heading down toward west Whidbey, we headed north to try to find them (after waiting an hour or two for the fog to clear!). Unfortunately, there was still fog out on the water, and though we looked from Pt. Partridge and Ft. Ebey State Park, we were unable to find the whales until about

4:50 pm
, watching from our observation point at Ft. Casey State Park. The orcas were over near the
Port Townsend
side of Admiralty Inlet, just NW of Pt. Wilson, heading into Admiralty Inlet. At 5 pm, some were off downtown Pt. Townsend, and some of the whales began heading back NW. We thought they might all turn around with the tide, but they all ended up keeping the course to the south, passing by in many small spread out groups. By around 6 pm, the last of the groups had passed Ft. Flagler, still heading south, and the fog and dusk were taking over.
