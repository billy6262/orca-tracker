Orca Sightings for July 23, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
All the people on shore today from the south end of
San Juan Island
up the Westside were treated to
J's and K's
doing the waltz back and forth from
11am to 5pm
! We saw J-1 with one of the new calves at the 5pm pass by LimeKiln Point, as they headed back south.

This afternoon at about

3:45 J-Pod
headed north past
Land Bank
on the westside of San Juan Island. They met up with a southbound
K-Pod
just off of
Lime Kiln
, and both pods headed south past Land Bank at about

5:00
. They were quite social and the family groups were "all mixed up", with J1 and J2 traveling with the K12s and the J14s traveling with K13 and part of her family. There was a lot of kelping, tail slapping, breaching, and general play. Some of my photos from the passby can be seen
here
.

J Pod
was seen coming in from the west, J1, J2, J28 and J27 and others I managed to ID, with some of
K's
(K 21 Cappuccino) at least on our first Ocean Magic trip at
9am
. We encountered them south of
Trial Island
and heading east toward
San Juan Island
- there were lots of whales. 'Sharking' and 'porpoising' behaviours were seen amid the sizeable chop on the water. The next trip at
12.15pm
encountered some of
J pod
foraging close to shore near Cattle Point, San Juan Island and in much calmer water. This little baby calf shown as the enclosed breach picture, was seen near J30 and J14.

On our

3:30
Ocean Magic Adventure trip, apparently all three pods (although didn't see any L's so not sure they were in the area) were in the area today. When we arrived, the pods were spread far apart up and down the shoreline of San Juan Island hunting, feeding and traveling. We started viewing
K pod
, a small group including K21 Cappuccino were traveling southbound north of
Lime Kiln
close to the shoreline. K's and some
J's
I believe passed VERY close to the shoreline off Lime Kiln park giving the many spectators onshore a front row, 5 star view of the animals. Based off what I saw through my lens, the orcas passing by would have been just a few feet from the shore where people were located. I saw a variety of behaviors today; breaching, pec slapping, speed porpoising, tail slapping, foraging and traveling. Because of our restrictions around the animals, we remained about a mile offshore. At the end of our trip, we saw 1 large male speed porpoising south.
