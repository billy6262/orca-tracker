Orca Sightings for July 30, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
9pm
we had wide spread group passing Thieves Bay,
Pender Island
, heading towards active pass. There was approx 20 or so whales and very possibly mother and calf. we had a couple close to shore but most were wide out in the bay - and here we do usually see them much closer to the shoreline than we did last night. We had some belly shows where they were on their back or side. One or 2 breaches. One enormous dorsal fin was clearly visible further out. They took approx 1 hour to pass - with them coming by in groups of around 4 at a time. Lots of tourists there to see this.

We met up with the "leaders" of this
Orca
train and paralleled them as they crossed
Haro Strait
towards False Bay on San Juan Island. I am quite positive that we were looking at K13 Skagit and her offspring: K20 Spock & her calf K38 Comet, K25 Scoter, K27 Deadhead, and K34 Cali. The great-grandmother (K11 Georgia) of 5-year-old Comet may have been there as well. This family group did spread out a bit as they traveled and we got a great look at K25 (an 18-year-old sprouter male) doing some fishing in a rip. His fin looked much like that of a shark as he quickly pursued his prey underwater! Behind this group was another large male and my guess is that it was L87 who may have a girlfriend in the group. He's been seen with K pod quite a bit in the last week or so!
