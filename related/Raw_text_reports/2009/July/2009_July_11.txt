Orca Sightings for July 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Depoe Bay, OR
8:45am
- Large black [
orca
] fin circling around in the water off the shore at Whale Point resort. Appeared to be feeding, would see the fin and the spray move around sporadically. Lasted about 10 minutes, unknown where the whale went after that. Also spotted numerous times were Gray whales, there were many ranging from 50 yards to 500 yards off whale point in
Depoe Bay OR
. The close range and way that the whales were swimming made it appear as if they were also feeding.

T40
and four to five other
transients
in
Endicott Arm
two miles from Ford's Terror, just outside of Taku inlet south of Juneau at approximately
5:25pm. and a day later more transients in Endicott searching for seals. May have some good I'd shots of them as well as of a pod of at least
20 residents
off
Point Coke
on our way to Juneau. Several babies who played in front of us until mama came and with audible vocalization appeared to be chastising them and took them away.
