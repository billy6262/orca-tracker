9pm
- Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay ferry - about 15 mins east of the entrance to
Active pass
, ferry had to slow down as a pod (spread out) passed on both sides. One mature male - large dorsal (pretty sure a resident) passed my side. A female surfaced very close to the ferry. In all I saw
5-6
, but not sure how many in total there were. They were eastbound, moving decent speed, no gymastics, heading towards Roberts Bank area.

Got home to hear some chatter on the radio at

6:30pm
about [
orcas
] in between islands - and I took a chance and headed down to
Cattle Point
, and sure enough, there they were! I headed out to the actual lighthouse and got a great view of watching about 30 SRKWs heading south out of San Juan Channel. I was pretty far away but thought I saw J1 and a few other large males. On the radio I heard all of J's were there, plus some L's. They went right past Whale Rocks, and headed South East out of the channel. Saw some nice big spyhops and a breach! It was great to see them all in about 3 different tight groups.

Another fantastic commune with
L pod
this afternoon off San Juan near
Cattle Point
. Our
2pm
POW Zodiac saw this beautiful saddle patch of L72 'Racer. What a unique marking to her patch. We also had Canuck L7. Several others, including L83 and her young one L110 were ambling around. One lone female logged at the surface for a while.

After we were on the water we heard reports of a large group of [
orcas
] heading northeast from
Albert Head, BC.
When we caught up with them just west of Trial Island at about
11:45, it was clear that all three pods were traveling together. While there were dorsal fins in every direction, we definitely saw the J14s traveling with J1 and J2, as well as the K11s and K12s. Back out again for our afternoon trip, all three pods had made significant progress east and we came across K21 and K40 just off of South Beach around
3:30, where they appeared to be doing some foraging. After a time, we started following a group of
L-Pod
whales that were heading towards Cattle Pass. Much to our surprise, they actually went IN to Cattle Pass! It really looked to me like they were just playing in the strong currents, as they were rolling around and slapping their tail, pec, and dorsal fins on the surface. The L12s were among the total of maybe 20 L-Pod whales in the pass. L92 was also there. When we got back to land curiosity got the better of me and I headed to the south end of San Juan Island to see if they were still in
Cattle Pass
. Sure enough, they were just off of Goose Island, but all grouped up now and heading back out towards the strait. At about
7:15 this evening they were heading west past Salmon Bank.

6.5 miles southwest of Trial Is. Lots of
Orcas
headed my way. We met
Js, Ks and some Ls
off the
Victoria
water front. In the
afternoon
they were spread out between
Henry Is. and Eagle Pt.
By evening, many had gone north toward Active Pass, while some had stayed south.

J's, K's and L's really spread out from
Salmon Bank
heading toward
Cattle Point
to Eagle Cove all the way to Turn Point, foraging with the strong flooding tide. Today, from

2:14pm to
3:40pm
, we got a nice looks at J-27 Blackberry, one of the new J babies, and K-20 Spock with energetic K-38 Comet who breached 3 consecutive times! The air was rich with that bait fish smell. We are seeing more marine birds than last summer, and I am thrilled to report my first sighting in 2 years of 3 Tufted Puffins, all dressed up in their beautiful breeding colors!!
