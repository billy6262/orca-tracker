L Pod
, with probably some

Haro Strait

At Turn Point we watched group after family group of orcas cruise along the cliffs and then splash and breach through the current lines and bull kelp beds around the point. We left them at

off
Lime Kiln

5:15 pm
- Just back at the cottage, reading a mail from Susan that there were SR's at the Lime Kiln hydrophone. Tuned in, but nothing to hear. Tuned over to the
OrcaSound hydrophone
(north of Lime Kiln - meaning the orcas headed north) and indeed, great calls!!!

Just north of
Lopez Island
we saw some mature male
orcas
. We were then able to determine that we were looking at L-pod based on the saddle patches. L-pod is the largest pod of the Southern Resident Community of orcas. There are about 39 orcas in this pod. We watched a few animals as they milled around the west side of San Juan Island, near False Bay. We then ventured offshore and found a few more individuals from L-pod. We saw a breach and a spy hop.
