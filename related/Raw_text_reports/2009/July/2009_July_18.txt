Just after attending the beautiful wedding of Nadja Baker & Jim Zimmerman (Orca Network volunteers & winners of last year's Orca Month prize) at
Lime Kiln State Park
, we were all ecstatic to see a few surprise guests show up in their black & white tuxedo's (with fins)! A
pod
(we believe it was J's?) passed by the rocks & lighthouse from about

4:30 - 5 pm
in the bright afternoon sun, very spread out & slowly heading north. Judging by the squeals and smiles of the bride & groom, we think they got just what they wanted on their wedding day!

A day to remember with high winds, big waves and
J and L pod
racing in from the west. We encountered them initially on the
12.15pm
Ocean Magic trip, travelling with their small sub family groups. They were spread out covering north and south of Race Rocks. They were heading super fast toward
Victoria harbour and Trial Island
. We saw incredible 'sharking' and 'porpoising' activity. Almost too fast to capture pics. One never knew where the orca would pop up as their movements were quite erratic. They seemed to be really pumped up by the crazy conditions on the water. We came across the
L2
family group and saw
L78's
new rake marks on his dorsal fin. It was apparent on both sides of the fin. Our second trip at
3.30pm
caught up with the L2's again at
Eagle Point, San Juan Island
. They were heading south in big seas.
