Orca Sightings for July 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
K's and the L2's
heading east with the flooding tide between the entrance to
Victoria Harbor
and Trial Island, Canada, from

3:20pm to
3:50pm
. They were all bunched up together, milling, foraging, some directional changes. A few spy hops, lunges, a side roll, and flukes in the air, and at times they all surfaced together, still amazing to see all those whales and fins shoulder to shoulder, making the long trip memorable. We identified K- 13, K-34, K-40, K-21, K-14, K-26, L-2, L-78, and L-88. L-78 Gaia had fresh propeller or rake marks on the right side of his dorsal fin.

3:30
trip, we found
Kpod
with a small group of L's (
L2's
) heading east towards San Juan Island. They were south of
Discovery Island
spread apart and picked up speed when entering Haro Strait. Some tail lobs, pec slaps, half breaches, speed porpoising and even some lunge feeding behavior. [
L78
] is bearing some war scars on the right side of his dorsal fin, some rough play or other sorts of amorous activity maybe :)

We found the lead
orcas
about halfway down
Discovery Island
(
1350
). Soon we saw a mix of K's and L's traveling together, and were able to ID K21 Cappucino, L78 Gaia, and L88 Wavewalker. It was so amazing to see the big boys all traveling together. We were also all surprised to see L78 had a new set of rake marks across the base of his dorsal fin. Looked mighty fresh- -rough-housing gone a bit far perhaps? We even had a breach by Wavewalker--my first time to see this young male out of the water. We left the whales at 1640 heading towards Lime Kiln. Maybe tomorrow the J's will return to join the other whales!

Big, big seas in getting across Haro St. to get out just past
Trial Island
to see the
Ks
. (Js were reported to be in Puget Sound, but were coming north this evening.) And this evening we left happy
Ks
headed south down island from
False Bay
.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report observing some
K pod
whales off west
San Juan Island
this
afternoon
- they had come in from the west.
*
Jason Wood of the Whale Museum called Orca Network at about

10:05 am
to relay a report he'd heard from Ron Bates, who had heard from the Victoria Clipper that
J pod
had been sighted in
Admiralty Inlet
. Also, reports that orca calls had been heard on the Port Townsend hydrophones at

11:30 pm
last night; and that there were also orcas at Race Rocks headed east this morning.
*
Jeff Hogan called Orca Network at

10:20 am
to relay a report of
orcas
at
Useless Bay
, SW Whidbey Island, headed south.
*
We found [
orcas
] from
Scatchet Head, SW Whidbey
- the whales were due south of us, midway between Scatchet Head and Apple Cove Pt, Kitsap Peninsula, heading E/SE toward Edmonds. They were in several groups, spread out and foraging, with lots of tail lobs, lunges, and a few breaches. We observed what looked like 25 - 35 orcas, with 4 - 6 adult males, definitely J pod whales present. One whale watch boat was with them, and several sail boats and small fishing vessels, all behaving well. At

12:16 pm
, they suddenly changed direction, and began heading back W/NW. By

1:45 pm
we had lost sight of the whales from our vantage point, as they continued NW - by then, Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries' NWFSC was nearly on scene with a team to collect fecal samples. They met up with them at about 2 pm off Pt. No Point (N. Kitsap Peninsula). We found the whales again at

3:25 pm
, just south of
Bush Pt
, still heading NW. We watched for 20 minutes as they passed very close to shore in several groups. We headed north to catch them as they came to Lagoon Pt. and by

4:20 pm
we saw the whales, still heading NW. We watched until

4:50 pm
- the whales were between
Marrowstone Pt. & Admiralty Head
, still heading NW. Brad and his team were still with the whales, and had collected about eight fecal and "whale snot" samples.

We live on Whidbey high bank on the south side of
Admirals Cove
(about 3 miles South of the ferry landing) facing Port Townsend. From about

5:30 to
7:30
tonight a series of pods of
Orcas
moved out of Admiralty Inlet - right down the center from left to right (South to North). One pod seemed to go around Fort Casey and off to the West Beach area of Whidbey and the second group that had two large finned Orcas milled around in mid channel for an hour before disappearing off toward Fort Worden. They just eased their way right down the center channel and headed out into the Strait - very cool.

I assume you were aware of the
pod
that was traveling northward past
Lagoon Point
today (

4:35 pm
) and that you knew who they were but here are some shots I got zoomed to the max and cropped. Don't know if you can ID anyone from these shots. They were perhaps 1/2 mile out (closest I have seen any for a while).

Kit Turner of
Lagoon Pt.
called at

4:30 pm
to report a pod of
orcas
going north past the northern end of Lagoon Pt.
*
Mike Waitt called at

4:25 pm
to report
orcas
a few hundred yards off
Lagoon Pt.
One male had a large wavy fin (Ruffles/J1).
*
Fran at
Bush Pt.
called at about

3:45 pm
to report orcas heading north, close in. A group of 6, then 3, then 3 - 4 more.
*
Pat Scott called at

3:40 pm
to report several pods of
orcas
passing
Bush Pt
. - first a group of 3, then several groups of 2.
*
Erick Peirson called to say the Port Townsend Whale Watch boat (Olympus?) had found
J pod
off the SW corner of
Whidbey Island
at
11 am
. They stayed with the whales as they headed toward Kingston, leaving them at about
12:30 pm.
