Orca Sightings for July 3, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
1
Gray Whale
at Simpson Reef, just south of the entrance to
Coos Bay, Oregon
. Stayed in the local area between Simpson Reef and Cape Arago, observed 1 and 2
July 09 in the mid afternoon, appeared to be feeding. While we were volunteer interpreters at Simpson Reef, we recieved reports of a gray whale just to the North of us and another just to the South of us.

Orca
- 4 individuals, including 1 male at
Simpson Reef
, just South of the enterance to
Coos Bay, Oregon
, traveling, although they did circle back North like they were trying to "sneak up" on the seals and sea lions. I had lost them when a sea lion started screaming and alerted me to where they were. Orca have been seen here before.

Around
4pm
we encountered the J's traveling north up
Active Pass
. Ruffles and Granny spent some time in kelp beds until a couple BC Ferries came through and they headed into
Georgia Strait
. We observed Ruffles hunting and the rest of the J's were pretty spread out. Lots of spy hopping, porpoising and a few breaches from the calves!

We just caught a quick glimpse of approximately 10
Orcas
off
Point Roberts
at
7 pm
. There was at least one large adult male present; all were moving quickly and heading south.

My wife and I arrived at
Turn Point
right when a fairly large pod of 15 to 20 [
orcas
] arrived headed northbound. (all 3 pods were reported heading north at that place & time - sb) the whales were pretty spread out (as were the whale watching boats) and most of them headed toward the Point, but a couple of groups stayed outside - one group of 4 looked like a male, 2 females and a juvenile and were very active - there was breaching and tail slapping and it looked like the juvenile was trying to imitate the larger whales - about this time, a very large fully loaded container ship comes barreling down
Boundary Pass
and starts making the turn into Haro Straight - my guess would be 25 knots - it looked like he was headed straight at the quartet of whales - they got closer and closer and we were getting real nervous because it looked like they were on a collision course - when they seemingly were about to meet we realized, with great relief, that the whales knew what they were doing and were well inboard of the ship- when they passed along side the vessel, the male did a full out of the water breach and roll as if to say hello - the 4 of them then made a beeline for the wake at the back of the ship and started surfing the wave - 2 of them used the wake to catapult themselves out of the water, seemingly able to jump much farther out of the water with the help - after the ship was gone there was a lot of tail slapping and pectoral fin slapping.

The Ocean Magic, out of Victoria, encountered several members of
L Pod
at
4.30pm
heading south west off
Salmon Bank
. We saw Mega L41 and his sisters. They put on quite the show for us with many breaches , tail lobs, pectoral fin waves and backward swimming. Several others were off in the distance exhibiting the same behaviours. We left them heading south west.

We got word that there were some resident
orcas
near False Bay on the west side of the island. We encountered some of
L-pod
, the largest pod of the Southern Resident
Killer Whales
. We got some great views of L-pods new calf, L-112 and L-86, the mother.
