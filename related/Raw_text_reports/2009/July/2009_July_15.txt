Orca Sightings for July 15, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Reports of whales led us from about
3pm to 4pm
to
Rosario Strait
, past Thatcher's Pass, as the fog was lifting to reveal all three Pods form a
Super Pod
heading south. Slack ebb tide once again made for great visibility! L-79 showed his hunting skills, rapidly lunging and turning, with a female- mom L-22 close by his side. How does one describe seeing whales everywhere, let alone 85 whales exhibiting their full array of surface behaviors?!!

I got some good photos of
L78
(Gaia) and his new rake marks as well as a picture of him breaching! We saw K pod and looked like lots of L pod as well, at least the L 2's, at the bottom on
cypress island
.

5:30pm
large group of
orcas
went from east to west, past the south end of
Lopez Island
. First group of about 8 were traveling very fast. Many others followed but not as fast, in groups of two to eight. Breaches, spy hops, tail slaps were all part of the show.

As we slowly and carefully made our way across
Rosario
(
1530
), we heard on the VHF that we had members of
all three pods
together again! The whales slowly meandered south and it was great to see the matrilines coalesce and break apart in apparent mating behaviors. Lots of rolling on top of each other, pushing each other to the surface from below, multiple tail slaps, spyhops, and some mighty incredible breaches. We ID'd J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, L79 Skana, L78 Gaia (with his new rakes), J30 Riptide. We left the whales (
1639
) still heading towards Colville/bottom of
Lopez Island
.

L's
in two tight groups eastbound
Swirl Island
[South Lopez) at
1140
. Turned north at Davidson Rock 1230. Reports of J's and K's southbound at Deepwater Bay at about that time, so they should be getting together as we speak (

1:45 pm
).
