Orca Sightings for November 23, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I think they (
orcas
) slipped out again. Val's program detected and recorded
calls
4 times between

00:38-52
early this morning. Definitely one S1 call early on, and a clear couple of S16s later - so maybe J pod was heading out?! Details are in the OrcaSound.net PTMSC detection log under the Meta- analysis tab.
