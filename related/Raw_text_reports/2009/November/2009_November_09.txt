Orca Sightings for November 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had the chance to go out with Princess Whale Watching out of Fisherman's Wharf,
Monterey, Ca.
We saw
10-12 Orcas
. I am guessing Transients by their behavior. First came upon a large, dorsal fin male. Beautiful. Just traveling along with a female. Then the female took off, porpoising out of the water. I don't know if we ever saw her again. Then a female and a youngster, older calf headed towards the male and us in a fast pace motion, porpoising and passed us. They ended up with a group of Orcas, approx 9 feeding on something. Once they all grouped up, then they tried to get away from us, traveling together. There was a total of 3 calves that we saw. 2 definitely very small, youngsters, but the other one that passed by us, was definitely an older calf. Michele Wassell
Some of the transient killer whales that Michelle spotted in Monterey included the large male
CA79
, and
CA138
and her
calf
.
