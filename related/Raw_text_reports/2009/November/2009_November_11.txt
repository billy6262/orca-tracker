Orca Sightings for November 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called at

4:53 pm
to report that
Js, Ks & L87
had turned north and just swam by the
Victoria
waterfront, where he saw and confirmed the
new J pod calf, J46!
*
New Calf!!! Can you tell I'm excited. Will post story and more pics on my blog.
Js and Ks
on the west side with a new baby - WOW!.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island

Thanks to Scott's hydrophone reports, I was able to head out to
Lime Kiln
(west San Juan Island) and look for the residents he heard. At about
2 PM
we had
Js and Ks
head south, very spread out across Haro Strait. While its always exciting to see orcas in November, it was an extra special encounter since we saw J28 Polaris with what looks very much like a brand new calf! At the age of 16 this would make her a first-time mother (as far as we know). I wrote a little more about the experience and posted a few more pictures at my blog.
