Orca Sightings for November 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here is a report I received this am from Bryan Gates up near
Campbell River
, Vancouver Island. Too bad we can't ID this nice group: Large pod of Killer Whales still in
Strait of Georgia
NW of Mitlenatch Island as of
0900
. Well offshore, but estimated to be 10 to 15 animals and likely the same group seen there Nov. 4, 2009. Currently moving in circles, but may be drifting NW. Wind and whitecaps, and too far from Saratoga Beach/Oyster River for ID.
