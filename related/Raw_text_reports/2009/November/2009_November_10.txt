Orca Sightings for November 10, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
U38 and U39
were off of
Victoria
again all day today taking out seals. I saw at least 7 seal kills throughout the day. They led me to
T103
and the
T049A's
who were in the process of digesting a prey item themselves.
