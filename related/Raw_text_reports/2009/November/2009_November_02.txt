Blows from
baleen whales
observed from the beach at
Juan de Fuca Provincial Park in BC
, Canada. The blows repeated several times, but the dorsal area of the animals could not be seen. Finally, the arching back and dorsal fin of a small humpback became visible. The blows continued, and soon the speckled white and gray finless dorsal of a gray whale came into sight. The gray whale surfacings continued intermittently throughout the next couple of hours, with more arching dives than dorsal-less blows seen. All animals were observed a couple hundred yards off the beach on the full moon spring tide.
