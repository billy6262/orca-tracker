Orca Sightings for December 4, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
1536
many [
orcas
] reported going East from
Sooke
(S. Vancouver Island).
Ron Bates, MMRG, Victoria B.C.
*
Turned on the OrcaSound
Port Townsend hydrohones
around
6 pm
, and listened to
calls
until around

7:35 pm
. Southern Resident orcas (Js, Ks & some Ls?) heading back into Puget Sound? And passing by Whidbey in the dark - again!!
Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island

I'm hearing whales on the Port Townsend hydrophone; it's

6:15 pm
PST, and I've heard them since
6 pm PST
. (When I turned the stream on.) They're a bit hard to hear with all the underwater noise, but I'm hearing "wheeeee--ooh. wheeeee-ooh." whistles, and lots of them. Also those at a higher octave. Lots of boat noise, but definitely whales!!

1733
- clear
calls
now on the
Pt. Townsend Hydrophones
.

Ks
(& some Ls?) were down by the Oddass Buoy, west of Hein Bank, and about
12 miles SE of Victoria
, but the seas got too big and we bailed. A spotter with big glass saw some breaches and porpoising but he lost them 15 minutes before we got there.
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called at

10:10 am
to report he was hearing
J pod calls
on the L
ime Kiln
, San Juan Island hydrophone.
*
It was Giles, and she said "LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW!" And lo and behold-
J Pod
!!!! The only whale I saw was
J1
, as the whales were spread 3-4 miles from shore past the midpoint of Haro Strait. They were heading southerly, at around
9 am
.
John Boyd (JB), San Juan Island
*
Just saw at least
6 orca
in
Haro Strait
near Low Island at

8:15 am
. There were two males for sure. They were spread out and traveling steadily. There could have have been more. I'm listening to them on the lime kiln hydrophone right now (
8:40 am).

Calls and clicks
on
Lime Kiln
and Orca Sound (NW San Juan Island) hydrophones now (

8:20 am
) thanks to Jeanne/Laura/Cathy. I've only been hearing S1s for last 10 mins though, so there's some chance it's J pod and K/L are still down- sound. Jeanne sees them a "couple miles" off Lime Kiln as of
0810
, probably heading southward. She thinks she may have heard some L pod calls earlier and maybe there are two groups on west side??
Scott Veirs, Beam Reach/OrcaSound, Seattle
*

7:35 am
-
Lime Kiln
, San Juan Island, calls still being heard, getting louder, and hearing multiple calls amongst ship noise.
Cathy Bacon
*

6:44 am
- faint
calls
being heard on
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
.
6:53 am - residents I believe - getting louder though still in distance.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
*
OrcaSound's (hydrophones on NW San Juan Island) automatic detection picked up its first
orca call
just before
5 am
.
Val Veirs, San Juan Island

Mary Eldred of Bremerton called again today to report the
Gray whale
that has been reported near Manette and the
Bremerton
Naval Museum/Turner Joy ship. She had seen it again at about

4:40 pm
, but this time said she thought it had a small dorsal fin and long pec flippers - and looked darker and larger than a Gray whale - with a tail possibly like a humpback?
