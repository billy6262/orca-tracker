Orca Sightings for December 3, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
two transient killer whales
, one male and one female or juvenile male slow traveling East-South- East at

4:10pm
past the Land Bank's Westside Preserve on
San Juan Island
this afternoon. We saw two breath intervals then had to leave before they came back up after a long dive. Beautiful, flat calm water!!!
Giles, San Juan Island
*
Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC, called to report they had located the
orcas
(members of
K & L pods
) reported earlier in the day (see below) at

12:55 pm
, south of
Scatchet Head
, SW Whidbey Island, milling. At

2:23 pm
, he called to say they were still south of Pt. No Point, N. Kitsap Peninsula, and north of the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lane, still milling and foraging, and gradually gravitating southward. By
4 pm
, the whales had begun moving back
NW
. He was with the trailing end of the group, including K11 and one of the males, south of Point No Point, while the rest of the whales were further North.
*
Orca Network received a call from Patty Michak at

8:20 am
, reporting
orcas
off
Point No Point
(N. Kitsap Peninsula) heading south toward Edmonds/Kingston & Puget Sound. She saw 3 - 4 orcas, including 1 male. It is possible there are more out there, spread out - and possible it could be the Southern Residents that were off Victoria yesterday.
Update
: Patty emailed us several photos which we sent to the Center for Whale Research. Dave Ellifrit responded that he believed the whales were maybe
K20 and K25
, confirming our suspicion these were the Southern Residents reported off Victoria yesterday.

Gray whale
