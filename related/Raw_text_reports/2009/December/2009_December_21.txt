Orca Sightings for December 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just got a call (from my dad) from the
Vashon- Tacoma ferry
and they saw a pod of
orcas
frolicking/breaching on the way back to Point Defiance terminal, at ~

2:30 pm
. They're still on the ferry watching them. Just wanted to let you know!

At about

3:45 pm
Debbie Dickenson saw a "huge" pod of
orcas
in the SE corner of
Commencement Bay
, near where she works at the top of a granary, with a wide view of the bay.
*

4:25pm
, Point Richmond Beach (
Gig Harbor
). Pod of
Orca (30+)
sighted heading northbound up Colvos Passage at slow to moderate pace.

San Diego Orcas
- Today Sarah and I took the Western Explorer out off of San Diego to, well, explore a bit. It was a beautiful winter day, just a bit overcast, yet warm, with just a gentle swell rolling beneath us as we headed offshore. Soon we found a lone little
Minke
whale. Then we encountered a large male Elephant seal bobbing in the water, catching his breath after what was probably a very long dive. Then on to the Coronado Islands we went, encountering playful Common and Pacific White Sided Dolphins along the way. The islands, as always, were magnificent in their jagged beauty. Still no Gray Whales or Fin Whales (both of which we were hoping to find), so I decided to head further offshore to search. Then I noticed a tall dark shape in the distance. Soon we were surrounded by
about 20 Orca Whales
, including 3 adult males. After a few minutes of observation it became clear that these were Offshores, as opposed to Transients. Most of the time we observed the whales we had several sea lions following along behind them. We were also lucky enough to observe them feeding. From the photo and description of the whales that were described in the
December 14th Orca Network Sightings Report I feel that these are probably the same whales. It was one of the most amazing encounters I have experienced!

Ivan's wonderful photos and report were forwarded to researchers on our "Coast Researcher" list, and we received this response from Alisa Schulman- Janiger:
I am VERY interested in the killer whale sighting that you had on yesterday. There have been other killer whale sightings (about 9 miles off Pt. Loma) on
December 12 (5 KW),
December 13 (10-15 KW), and
December 17 (6 KW - last seen heading toward the Coronados Islands). We have VERY few killer whale photo- documented from your sighting area, so these are extremely important sightings. Especially because last Thursday's sighting included a newborn calf! Did you notice a very small calf? Also, It looks like one of your images shows a killer whale with just a stump of a dorsal fin. Do you know if this was a juvenile or an adult? I know of several killer whales that could be called "Stumpy" or "Chopfin" - including an offshore, a transient, an ETP, and an unknown-type killer whale - all of which have been documented off of California. Coronados Islands: if these were offshore killer whales, this is the furthest south that they have been documented! Did you confirm any of these as offshores? We have over 50 offshore sightings in CA now - about 5 in the last 3 months. I'm working on many of the latest IDs - checking for resights - over the next few weeks. Off the San Diego area we have documented the LA Pod, transients, offshores (last year), Mexican killer whales, and eastern tropical Pacifics (ETPs) - everything but residents. The two (low resolution) images that I've seen so far of the killer whales from
December 17 are quite possibly matches with three of the killer whales from your sighting. I'll immediately work on IDing those killer whales, and will pass on the IDs to Orca Network. And if you see them again, please point them my way. We are getting plenty of fin whales and blue whales - but no killer whales! Thanks so very much!

Wow!! Ivan Reiff really hit the jackpot with this sighting! I suspected that these were eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) killer whales - and they are!! I believe that there is only one previous confirmed ETP sighting in California (off of La Jolla, CA earlier this year), and a few other probable sightings. Looking at Ivan's higher resolution images, I can DEFINITELY ID the big male as E261, an ETP killer whale. According to the 2008 ETP killer whale NOAA publication referenced below, he was previously photographed in the Gulf of California in 2006. The authors (Paula Olson and Tim Gerrodette) identified 195 individual killer whales in the eastern tropical Pacific between 1986 and 2006. ETP killer whales tend to have darker saddles and often have stalked barnacles (Xenobalanus sp.) on their dorsal fins. Ivan's images clearly show all of the killer whales have stalked barnacles on their dorsal fins (and one on its pectoral fin). These are a hallmark of southern killer whales: those found off Mexico and the ETPs. Over ~30% of the killer whale groups that have been photographed in the ETP display these barnacles, according to the ETP killer whale catalog. The LA Pod (which spent much time in Mexican waters) sometimes displayed these barnacles, unlike transients, residents, or offshores. This catalog is a sister publication to the catalog that I coauthored: Killer Whales of California and Western Mexico: A Catalog of Photo-Identified Individuals (1997). We had noted that Mexican killer whales often have these stalked barnacles. These barnacles can make photo-IDs extremely difficult to confirm; what first appear to be distinctive fin shapes may actually be artifacts caused by barnacles. Here is the ETP killer khale catalog information: "Killer whales of the eastern tropical Pacific: A catalog of photo-identified individuals" NOAA Technical Memorandum. NOAA-NMFS-SWFSC-428. The authors of this publication are Paula Olson and Tim Gerrodette. Paula states that "this is the first photo-identification catalog of tropical pelagic killer whales, and yields information on the geographic movement and external morphology of this little known population of killer whales." Contact Paula if you wish additional information about this catalog: Paula Olson (Paula.Olson@noaa.gov). It is quite possible that all of the recent San Diego sightings may turn out to be ETPs! I'll keep you updated on this.
