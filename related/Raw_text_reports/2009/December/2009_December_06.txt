Orca Sightings for December 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were reports of a
grey whale
in crescent bay off salt creek recreation area (near
Pt. Angeles
) over the weekend.
Rob Casey, Seattle

Joy and I saw, what looked like
orcas
off the bluff near
Bush Point
(SW Whidbey Isl) on Sunday. Several were heading south.
Craig Johnson, Freeland

After receiving a call about
orcas
heading past
Pt. Wilson
into Admiralty Inlet, we headed to Ft. Casey State Park, arriving at

3:05 pm
to see blows mid-far channel, between Ft. Worden & the Pt. Townsend mill smokestack, heading SE. We watched until approx.
4 pm
, as the orcas moved very fast, with some porpoising and splashing over by Ft. Flagler, toward Lagoon Pt, Whidbey Island. The whales were too distant for IDs, so we headed south to Lagoon Pt, where we arrived at
4:30 pm, just as the last 4 - 5 orcas were heading past, still heading south, closer to the Whidbey side. We watched until

4:50 pm
, as the light and whales were fading away. Luckily, the whales were IDd as K pod, by the calls heard from the Pt.Townsend hydrophones.
