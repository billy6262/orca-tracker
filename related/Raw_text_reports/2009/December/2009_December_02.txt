Orca Sightings for December 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

16:51
I captured a photo off of
Clover point
. Group of orcas about 2 miles a beem of me, heading eastbound in Juan de Fuca Strait. Got word that animals were inbound. I was not able to see them clearly enough to identify who they were. I lost them as they continued east.

Encounter began very shortly after departure (cheers Crows Nest!). Approximately 1.5 miles southwest of VH buoy (
Victoria
Waterfront) our
1300h
whale watch departure aboard MV EagleWing came across
10-12 Resident orca
. Behaviour appeared to be "slow forage" with some logging displayed by one of the larger bulls. Reports of more KW's east of our location (Trial Island-Seabird Pt.) were not confirmed by our exploration in that area. KW's we did encounter proved to be a mix of Lpod and Kpod with positive ID's of
L88 and K40
traveling together and
K22
. A beautiful day to be out on the water.
Chris Zylstra & Ly Ngo, Eagle Wing Tours, Victoria BC
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research confirmed these IDs from the photos sent in by Ly:
K33, K36, K40, L88
are in the first batch of pics. I'll wait to see more photos but it wouldn't surprise me if it was just the K's and L2's.
