Orca Sightings for December 7, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At about

3:30 pm
I watched 2 large male
killer whales
(U38 and U39) from Dallas Rd in
Victoria
. I saw them pass in front of the Canadian Navy ship which makes for a nice photo. Then saw "Mallard" CWR / DFO on scene documenting the two transients (see photos and report in our Dec. 7 Whale Report). I noticed the animals went down on a very long dive because I didn't see anything after a while. My guess is they were in predation mode as the research boat remained on scene and attentive. After getting a coffee to warm up my freezing hands, I changed my location and returned to find the animals and the research boat further away towards the Metchosin shoreline.

After receiving a call that
orcas
were heading north into
Admiralty Inlet
, we set out for the west side of Whidbey to try to find the whales from land. We found them at

12:55 pm
from Double Bluff, SW Whidbey - we were able to see spouts south of
Pt. No Point
, N. Kitsap Peninsula, heading north. 12+ blows were counted in one area at the same time, though more whales were likely present. By 1 pm they were off the Pt. No Point Lighthouse. We traveled to N. Mutiny Bay for a better viewpoint, and watched them from
1:30 pm, heading north past Skunk Bay/Hansville, the leaders reaching Foulweather Bluff at around
2:10 pm. We went up to Bush Pt, at
2:40 the whales were south of S. Marrowstone Island, heading north, as a Navy sub and escorts passed by going south. By

3:40 pm
they were off
Ft. Flagler
, continuing north. We went to Lagoon Pt, finding the whales at
3:53 pm directly off Lagoon Pt, and a bit closer to the Whidbey side, with a few direction changes and foraging. They were off the Ft. Flagler Lighthouse by
4:08 pm, spread out across the channel. We left at

4:20 pm
as they continued north.

1443
: Whales in the center, just west of channel between SE
Marrowstone Island and Bush Point
on SW Whidbey Island (48 00.31N, 122 37.23W). Headed north at a good clip, playing chicken with a sub. They were just getting up toward Marrowstone Point when we left them, around
1645
, still northbound around 5 knots. They became much less vocal by the end of the second deployment.

I am just piecing together what I saw today in
Admiralty Inlet
from the boat on the AIKWS survey (Erick & Heather are helping with collecting data on orcas for the Snohomish PUD Admiralty Tidal project. They are deploying vertical hydrophone arrays to gather data on the whales' behavior while in the study area. Orca Network is helping with land response and observations). I can confidently ID
K11's
family: K11, K13, K25, K27, K34, K20, K38, K K34, K27. K25 was seen swimming with L87, who is often seen with the K11's. We saw these whales numerous times and recorded them twice. From my vantage point I could not see any other groups of whales, so not sure if the rest of K's were there and/or Jpod.

We sighted a small pod of
orcas
traveling north at

4:15 pm
. We live at the northernmost end of
Lagoon Point
. Looked like a couple males and some smaller whales.

I am on
marrowstone island
between lip lip and Kinney Point - It is really clear today so I can see pretty far south - saw two big leaps and a few breathing spouts about

2:15 pm
just this side of what I think is pt no pt (little white house on the spit) - kept looking to confirm - now they are moving ne this side of the shipping lane buoy marker towards whidbey.

2:41 pm:
Big male dorsal fin - moving north again just south of what i think is double bluff - if that little red boat is you guys - you're heading right into them. 3 pm: moving fast - now right off of lip lip - just went head to head with a nuclear submarine - 2 family groupings in the fore - big male farther back - red boat must be you -

Christina Baldwin called at
3 pm
to report
orcas
south of
Bush Pt
, Whidbey Island, heading north, near a Navy submarine. They saw several male fins and a lot of blows.

Was at the offleash dog park in
Edmonds
, Washington today around
3pm
. Lady leaving the park said there was a pod of
orcas
"right off the point", so I ran to see if I could catch them. By the time I got my camera out of my pocket and got my gloves off, they were futher out. I could see the spouts, but I could not make out the dorsal's. I also could not make out how many; What I COULD make out though, was the spouts and it looked like a line of white caps moving on down the sound. This was about a mile and a half down from the Edmonds ferry dock, pod was headed south, at 3pm.

Had
Transiets U38 and U39
Off
Victoria
this
afternoon
, I thought I had at least 1-2 females as well but boat on scene and other spotters only had 2.
