Orca Sightings for December 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Took these images of the
Gray whale
that is hanging out near Manette and the Turner Joy (
Bremerton
Naval shipyard & museum). Whale was on a regular schedule for the hour I observed it - surfacing every two minutes (+/-), usually an exhale, short underwater, then rising again and making the pre-dive move. Unusual head shape - and looked encrusted so it is virtually white. Left tail fluke has an unusual pattern on the top - seems also to have a significant white spot on the trailing edge. Whale was a fair distance off and shot with a Nikon 70- 200 mm. Have more images, but I think this is just a Gray that likes something about the little area that the whale has been staying.

At approx.
3 pm
we observed a large pod (many spouts over a mile wide area) of
orcas
from the lookout on the Fragrance Lake trail in Larrabee State Park. I saw one dorsal fin with my binoculars, which i suppose was a male. The spray from their exhalations was held aloft by the strong north winds which ade it easy to spot them from so many miles away. the pod was moving south between
Lummi Island
, Sinclair Island and Barnes? Island.

There were reports of a
grey whale
in
crescent bay
off salt creek recreation area (near
Pt. Angeles
) over the weekend. We were surfing there.

7:56 pm PST
: I'm hearing faint S16
calls and whistles
(K Pod?) on the
Port Townsend Hydrophone
; they've come and gone over the last 15-20 minutes.
8:23 pm PST: Over the last half hour I've heard K pod /S16 calls, and they had gotten louder, though now are very faint. I checked the Limekiln HP to see if they'd moved up towards it, but no luck. This is around the same time I heard them last night; I wonder if they only stuck around there all day? (read reports below to see where they spent the day!)

Alerted by the emails about So Resident orca calls at Port Townsend, my wife and I bundled up and went down to the pier (at Pt. Townsend Marine Science Center) to listen to the speakers. We could hear the calls clearly but our bright spotlight did not reveal any black fins in the black water and black night.

Thanks for taking my call this afternoon from Shore Medows Rd (
Mutiny Bay, SW Whidbey Island
). Sandra and I were headed to Bush Pt to see if there was enough beach to go for a walk. Sandra sugggested a stop by Shoremeadows Rd for a quick scan. She sat in the car while I walked to the end of the road. All I saw was a tug and barge headed north so I came back to the car. Sandra had the binocs and was excited to see
whales
. We headed back to the end of the road where we watched them and called you. After speaking with you (

3:48 pm
) we watched until it was too dark, about an hour. They were between Hansville and the entrance to Hood canal moving north. We wanted to see if they were headed into the canal but it got dark before we could tell. We saw as many as 6 fins at one time so I would gestimate there were about a dozen out there. But then that was 4 or 5 miles away so we probably missed a few. Sandra saw some breaching and they appeared to be in traveling mode.

Jennifer Hagerman called to report seeing the orcas off
Mutiny Bay, SW Whidbey Island
at
1 pm
, heading south, and again at 4 pm, heading north. At 4 pm they were not yet quite to the entrance to Hood Canal.

After getting the reports below of Orcas heading into Admiralty Inlet, we launched a land and boat response. Howard, & Jill & Clarence Hein headed up to launch from Keystone, Erick Peirson launched from Port Townsend, and Susan did a land response and found the
orcas
at approximately

11:35 am
, between the south end of Marrowstone Island and the entrance to Hood Canal, heading north. Several adult males were seen, but they were too far out to ID the pod. At
11:50 am, we had a report of orcas off Keystone as well, but we were never able to find and confirm those whales. Just after the orcas down south reached the SE side of Marrowstone, at around

12:25 pm
, they turned and headed back south. At
12:40 pm Howard and the Heins were with the orcas off the entrance to Hood Canal, still heading south. They traveled with them and took ID photos until 2 pm, when they left them just north of Double Bluff, SW Whidbey Island, still southbound.
