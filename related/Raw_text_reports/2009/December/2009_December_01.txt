Around
1500-1530
, while I was at American camp, San Juan Island walking the dog, I saw
4-6 orcas
waaay out there on the line from Eagle Pt. to Seabird Pt. on Discovery Island. The whales were probably several miles southeast of Seabird pt. and appeared to be moving west and were too far for any i.d.'s but the group size suggests transients.
