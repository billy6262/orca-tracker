I was 10-12 miles offshore of Point Loma
(San Diego), CA
(32.56,-117.34 - approx) with some co-workers and spotted a pod of
10-15 Orcas
, possibly more including one extremely large male and one small one had damaged dorsal. They were traveling south, in the direction of the Coronado Islands, Mexico. They were completely amazing to see up close!! We observed them at very close range. At one point, they (inclung the large male) were within arms reach of the boat. It was amazing!!!! We have video and stills that were taken with cell phones (see above). We watched from
1200 - 1330
, they were playing, possibly mating?
