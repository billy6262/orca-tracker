Orca Sightings for December 25, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Daniel Howes with a report of
2 female orcas
, heading south from the
Pt. Cabrillo Lighthouse
, Ft. Bragg CA. They were 1/4 mile from shore, loosely following a Gray whale.

I am writing to report a whale sighting in
Gig Harbor
, Washington. It was probably around
midnight
that a friend and I first spotted the whale. He looked to be smaller in size (maybe a baby?) and was alone in the sound. It was dark out, so identifying and distinguishing features was nearly impossible, but he didn't seem to be going anywhere. We watched him for a little over an hour but had to eventually leave due to the cold weather. I don't know the coordinates of the area, but it was next to the Tides Tavern in the harbor.

This is likely the
Gray whale
that has been reported in the Tacoma/Seattle area the past few weeks - last report it was under the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.
