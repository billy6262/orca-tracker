After a preliminary viewing of Ken (Balcomb's) and my transient shots it seems as though the inshore group contained
T036A, T036A1, T137, and T137A
. The group offshore which had the grey orca (most likely Chediak- Higashi Syndrome) contained T068, and T068A. Will wait to get confirmation from G. Ellis and J.Towers of P.B.S and D.Ellifrit of C.W.R. to confirm if it belongs to T068C and rest of ID's.

Apple Cove Pt
, heading north toward Point No Point. Brad Hanson called at the end of the day, they had continued north with J & K pods and left them at
3:40 north of Bush Pt, spread out heading north riding the ebb tide out. They had been successful in collecting more fecal samples again today.

Susan headed out to find the
orcas
this morning from land and Howard and the Heins headed out in a boat hoping to get some ID photos. At
10 am
Susan saw spouts north of
Pt. No Point
, on the other side of the channel - not sure of direction, but possibly south. At
10:20 am they were off Point No Pt, milling, southbound. Lost sight of them off SW Whidbey in the haze and sun glare. At
10:45 am Howard & the Heins saw blows off
Foulweather Bluff
, but then lost the whales in the glare. Susan met Dan Kramer on the beach, and he reported seeing 2 orcas off Bush Pt. around noon, heading south, but he lost sight of them, and Susan continued to look for another hour or so for the whales north & south with no luck.

Erick Peirson reported
orca
spouts observed N. of

at

8:15 am
this morning. At

10:35 am they turned southbound at 3 knots.

Some
Transient orcas
had been sighted off the
Victoria
waterfront. Off we zoomed. I called Goldwing on the VHF as we got close, about 5 miles south of Trial Island, (

3:15
) and were told that one of the Orcas had a gray dorsal fin. Gray fin? It was the whole Orca that was gray and white, not just the fin. It's a calf and one of the
T11s
. In over twenty years of viewing Orcas in this area, I've never seen a gray Orca. I was flabbergasted! Here are some pictures of the calf. (All of the pictures have been cropped.) I think Ken Balcomb also got some shots.

Tom Wiggin called to report a
gray whale
500 yards west of Fox Pt, on the East end of
Fox Island
, S. Puget Sound from sunrise to
8 or 9 am
this morning, then heading north through Hales Pass. Then he sent this update and photos which have been forwarded to Cascadia Research for ID: This morning just after sunrise I heard a gray whale blow very close in front of the house. The whale appeared to be feeding in approximately 30 feet of water in the same area in the flood tide for about an hour, then departed northwest through Hale Passage. Our neighborhood really enjoyed watching nature's treat - fabulous. Thanks for your work, which must be a joy. Warm regards,
Tom and Noni Wiggin, Fox Island, Puget Sound
