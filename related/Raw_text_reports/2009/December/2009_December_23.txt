2 orcas
, 1 with a larger fin, NE of the
Pt. Wilson
buoy heading west at

*
We are on a mooring buoy on the west side of Eagle Island (
S. Puget Sound
) at 47.11.242N and 122.41.897W and saw a
gray whale
swimming around for quite a long time. Last spotted heading east, next to the north side of Anderson Island, but it has been circling around the west side of Eagle Island for a while now - observed from

8:35am
and last sighting was at

9:18am
. It looked to be playing, but not sure if it was feeding or not. There was a seal trailing it, so it could have been feeding.
