The MV Sea Lion headed out to
Hein Bank
today and caught up with a
Minke Whale
feeding there. Two other whale watch boats were in the area and they both had Minkes with them as well, for a total of
three
. We arrived at approximately

2:00 PM
and stayed for a little more than half an hour. We saw the whale surface 10 or 12 times coming rostrum first out of the water. We could even discern the rostral grooves and got good looks at the pointed snout.
