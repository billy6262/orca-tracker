Orca Sightings for June 2, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw
5 orcas
at
Yaquina Head
in
Newport Oregon
at
7am
. The latitude and longitude are: N 44.675672, W -124.082251. They appeared to be in transit, and I only saw them for about 5 minutes as they passed Colony Rock at Yaquina Head. They did not appear to be feeding. There was one male.

We received the below ID's for these Transient orcas reported off Yaquinna Head, Newport OR on
June 2nd: These animals(see above photo) look very much like the T124A matriline. T124A, T124A1, T124A2, and T124A3.

We conducted one of our monthly outer coast surveys from
Westport, WA
. It was incredibly calm, both in terms of weather and whales. We saw
two gray whales
,
two humpbacks
, small numbers of
Dall's and harbor porpoise
, and one northern fur seal all day. One interesting note was a gray whale that we found in the midst of a high density of crab pots. We were worried when we saw the whale swimming right into a set of buoys at the surface, but then it did it again, and again - at one point the whale actually took a set of buoys down with it when it dove, only to release them 10 seconds later. We were preparing ourselves for an entanglement, but apparently it was well aware of what it was doing, rubbing itself along the lines.

We have just heard from our vessel that they have encountered members of
L Pod
(the L12's) near
Albert Head, B.C.
This is the first confirmed sighting of members of L Pod in the waters off Victoria this season and what a wonderful surprise!

At a little before

3:00 this afternoon
, the
L12s
showed up a little to the east of Race Rock. Late in the evening, we left
L89
and
L22
way out west of Victoria this evening at

6:30
. We were lucky enough to see these breaches.

We had the
T-2s
I believe today along with
T-14
in the
Campbell River
area. Left on our tour at
1515
from C.R. with reports of orcas off of Fransisco Point, south end of Quadra Island. Went around and found
5
animals in post feeding activity. The young one was breaching alot, and amazing vocalization for about 40 minutes. Afterwards we headed to the mouth of Bute Inlet and found a black bear foraging along the shoreline. We found another black bear on Sonora Island on the way home, and some info on the way turned into finding "Pender" T-14 Southbound @ Cape Mudge (see photo above). A beautiful trip and happy guests with a 4hr safari turning into 6hrs!

Orca Network received a call from Jane at the Cape Mears Lighthouse, west of
Tillamook OR
reported 2
orcas
west of the lighthouse, heading north at

3:23 pm
.
*
Linda Taylor from the Whale Center in
Depoe Bay OR
called to report
3 or 4 orcas
about 1/2 mile outside Depoe Bay, heading north fast, at

8:45AM
.

We had some great looks at a
Gray Whale
today off of the beach near
NAS Whidbey Island
. It was foraging alone in approximately 25' of water and moving in no particular direction. I am guessing that this is the same animal that we have been seeing in the area for several days.

Kraig Hansen of Snohomish County Parks said they are still having sightings of a
Gray whale
or two in the
Everett

to report
2 Gray whales
off
NAS Whidbey
- one larger, & one smaller, off the Norwester Bldg, just south of the airstrip. They were there yesterday,
June 1 as well, and had been there in the same area since
10 am
this morning, feeding about 150 yards out.
