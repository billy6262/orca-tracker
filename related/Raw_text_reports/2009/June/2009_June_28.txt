Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered

K and L pods

12:30 p.m
. At
1:37 p.m. the last group passed Mouat Point on North Pender Island B.C. and continued travelling north up Active Pass. At

We had a great day today in
swanson channel
with at least
J pod and K pod
!!. I could not ID any L pod members but heard reports they were around. I got a good shot of J45? could not get a good look at the saddle but he was traveling right beside J14.

On the Western Prince we met up with the
L2s (L2, L78, L88)
as well as
L87
traveling southbound along the northwest side of
San Juan Island
. They were hugging the coastline, then surprised absolutely everyone by going on a long dive and veering offshore before surfacing among the boats. You can check out some photos of L88 Wavewalker passing by us here. When we left them at about

3:50
in the afternoon they were again southbound (a little further offshore this time) at about Andrew's Bay.

I had actually found whales earlier this
morning
from shore out on the west side of
San Juan Island
. They were slowly heading north towards the Center for Whale Research, and didn't seem to be in any hurry. We were able to join up with members of
J Pod, the L2's and the L12's
just as they approached the Turn Point Lighthouse on Stuart Island (
1200
). It was so beautiful. The whales were coming to the surface in groups of 6-8, and we were able to ID many members of J-Pod including J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J26 Mike, and J27 Blackberry. Soon we also saw L41 Mega, L78 Gaia, and many other L-Pod females. There were several times when the whale groups would come together, and during these times, we'd see lots of upside-down swimming, tail lobs, tail slaps. For the afternoon trip aboard the Western Explorer, we didn't catch up to the whales until they were approaching an area known as the
Coal Docks
(
1415
). They started "porpoising" or speed swimming about 300 yards in front of the boat. This was followed by multiple breaches, spyhops, and plenty more rolling around on each other. One whale must have breached at least 6-7 times in a row.

In the afternoon we were on land at
lime kiln
lighthouse. We first saw a small pod of Dall's porpoises and then coming north to south were
4 orcas
which the docent named as L-78, L-88 and L-26 and L-2. They were fairly close to shore and made for good viewing pleasure on a warm sunny day!

Orca Network received a call from Arlene Sullivan on Mayne Island, BC, reporting a report from neighbors who saw a pod of
orcas
heading SW through
Active Pass
.

A single
gray whale
swam past
Tulalip Shores
Sunday afternoon sometime
between
1:30 and
2:00pm
, heading south towards Tulalip Bay.

In the
morning all three pods
were going by my house on
Mitchell Pt
. so my evening passengers were able to come on down, and we got out to see them. Orcas everywhere. And it's always amazing watching the Residents come out of Active Pass and watching them smell the Fraser River, like yesterday afternoon. Though there were four Orcas that had turned in the morning and were off the West Side (San Juan Isl) , I decided to go North, and we were able to be there and greet them coming out of Active Pass (Active Pass seperates Maynes and Galiano Islands, up there in the Gulf Islands north of the San Juans).

We missed hearing the whales on the hydrophones at LimeKiln, but at

9:48 am
picked up some GREAT calls at
Orca Sound
, so they must have been heading north. Sounded like they were having a paty!
Susan & Howard, Orca Network, Whidbey Island

Lots and lots of calls on
LimeKiln
hydrophones with very little background noise.
