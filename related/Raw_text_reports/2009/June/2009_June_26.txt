Orca Sightings for June 26, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah of the Center for Whale Research departed Snug Harbor on vessels Orca and Starlet, and encountered whales traveling south past Kellett Bluff at
10:52 am (48° 34.146 N; 23° 11.113 W). The whales were very spread out and traveling at a fast pace. Several members of
K pod
were documented as well as the
L2's and L87
. The encounter ended two miles off Cattle Point (48° 23.642 N; 123° 01.217W) at
1:34 p.m. The whales were still very spread out across the strait and appeared to be heading west.

There were
two minke
whales feeding in the area of
Salmon Bank
today. We were with them from about

1:30 PM until
1:50 PM.
We then left the scene with them milling about generally headed inshore towards South Beach.

Eric and I went flying at

2:45 PM
, during the low tide and saw a lot of
very fresh whale pits
in the sand bars northwest of
Everett
. On our return flight at

5:30
we saw
two gray whales
feeding just west of Everett. I was unable to ID the whales.

3 Orcas
Sighted off Maury Island, just off the lighthouse at approx
5p.m.
Appeared to be feeding. Not close enough to see many markings.

We left the
Ks
last
night
off the Southern tip of
Lopez Isl
.
Js
had gone North in the morning, so they should be back today.

On our afternoon trip, we headed out to meet up with the Orcas reported to be heading north in
Swanson Channel
. When we arrived,
J Pod
was in a tight resting formation, drifting past Village Bay on Mayne Island. We knew that would likely change as they approached Active Pass. Sure enough, the tail slaps started just as they rounded the bend at Helen's Point. The whales stayed fairly tightly together until they were mid-pass, when the action really got going - upside-down swimming, breaches, tail slaps, pec slaps, spyhops - as they approached the tide rips at the east end of the pass. As they were exiting the pass, the whales did a long dive going through the final large tide rips, and surfaced some distance to the east. Once in the Strait of Georgia, the pod split into matriline groups and spread out for the crossing. The mud plume from the Fraser River had spread all the way across the Strait due to the low tide and earlier winds, and the whales seemed to be doing many more spyhops than we usually see as they exit Active Pass. We left J Pod shortly after their exit from Active Pass. They were still heading east towards the coal docks.

We received a call from Arlene Solomon, reporting a pod of
~10 orcas
, including 2 - 3 males, heading into the SW entrance of
Active Pass
between Mayne & Prevost Islands at
3 pm
.
*
Hopes were high as we headed west of
Salmon Bank
. We were all delighted to watch
K-11, K- 13, K-25, K-27, K-34, K-20, and K-38
, from

2:10pm until 3pm
, in close family groups foraging as they headed northwest toward Eagle Cove, and two groups of other whales along the shoreline. We came across two
Minke
whales foraging at
Salmon Bank
. The first Minke looked like an adult, the second a juvenile with a very curvy-hooked dorsal fin and a small white spot on the left flank. Both whales surfaced more often than we normally see, and close distance to each surfacing, so not so elusive and everyone saw them, along with rafts of marine birds!

In the area of
Middle Bank
we caught up with members of
L pod
. They were split up into family groups and were also showing feeding behaviors. The groups were spread out more than a mile from shore and were headed northwest making quiet vocalizations. By

3:30 PM
they had only progressed to Eagle Point.

Whales in
Active Pass
this afternoon. About

3:30 pm
, about
12 orcas
, heading east on a fast tide. Some tail slaps and breeches. Two snuffled right at the shore in the kelp.

8:30 am
- Just had one
grey whale
feeding in front of Spee-Bi-Dah beach (
Port Susan
). It looked a little lighter in color and smallar than other whales that we have seen.
Malcolm & Tarry Lindquist
*
Whales all over today on the west side of
San Juan Island
, very spread out. We were a mile or two off shore with
L78, K16 and possibly J35
, who played in a kelp bed, then pushed the kelp over towards us.
Jill Hein, Coupeville

Carole May reported hearing
orcas
on the
OrcaSound
hydrophone at

11:17 am
.
*
Calls and echo location heard all the way from Scotland from

11:00 -
11:25 PST
) Nothing heard on
Lime Kiln
.

We met up with
J-Pod
again heading north in
Swanson Channel
around
12 noon
. They were in nice tight groups and we spent most of our time observing the
J14
family group with J1, J2, and J8. We were able to identify every J- Pod family group but the J16s, so they either went undetected or were off on their own somewhere else. When we left them around 1 PM they were just nearing Otter Bay, still traveling north against a flood tide.
