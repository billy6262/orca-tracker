Orca Sightings for June 13, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Carla Hedgepeth called to report seeing
4 orcas
in
Winchester Bay OR
, near Coos Bay, and the Umpqua River, at
8 AM
. There was one male, a female and two juveniles. They were headed north in 40' deep water, at 43.41.800N by 124.12.589W.
*
Our evening tour spent time with a
Humpback Whale
. We think that it was the same animal from the day before, but this time it was in
Griffin Bay
at about

6:00 PM
. It was feeding in the current of the flood tide that was rushing through Cattle Pass. We tracked the whale as it traveled out through the pass and then lost sight of it in the rough water. There were no views of the flukes, but the animal was very active swimming up and down the channel as well as from side-to- side.

.

Up at Patos Island off Alden Point there were over a hundred
Harbor Porpoise
. Grouping up and doing many full jumps & breaches. Quite a sight. While on the way home to Orcas on our big loop from our monthly Lighthouse tour we got lucky and saw a
Humpback
whale inside
Griffin Bay
heading out to Cattle Pass.

We went out for a gorgeous day cruise with friends this afternoon, and towards the end of the cruise we were treated to a lone
gray whale
sighting north of
Hat Island
around
3pm
. It surfaced no more than 30 feet from the boat! We watched the whale for another 10 minutes as it headed west from us.

Rachael Paul called Orca Network to report a
Gray whale
and smaller whale or calf off NW Whidbey Island at

2:45 pm
. She watched them from
West Beach
all the way from Hastie Lake Rd. to Joseph Whidbey State Park as they headed north.

Orca Network received a call from Marion Fuller reporting a pod of
orcas
mid-channel off Kingston at about

10:35 am
, heading south. They saw at least 2 adults and possibly a younger whale.
