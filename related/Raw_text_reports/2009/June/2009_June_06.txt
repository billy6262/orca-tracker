Orca Sightings for June 6, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband & I saw a
gray
off the beach trail (
Joseph Whidbey State Park
, NW Whidbey Isl) at

6:30 PM
. It was good size & was heading south.

We were fishing out of Neah Bay, first sighting was
Humpbacks
11 miles out near J bouy. This is the east end of Swiftsure bank, there were 4 together and we saw them in a feeding pattern for many hours. One very large one did a full straight up breach and rose to about the rear hump, maybe 75 yards from us - very impressive! We thought that sharing the water with the humpbacks had made for an epic day and on our return about two miles west of Tatoosh Island
a pod of orcas
came in sight! Very actively feeding while we paralled them for a good period and made note the largest male had a dorsal that was turned over in a very tight curl at the top (right to left curled). I guess there were six or seven in the group with one small one probably half the size of the rest.
Greg, Mike, Shannon and Brett (the reporting group!)

Joe Alicea of Oak Harbor called to report a
Gray whale
off Joseph Whidbey State Park at

12:16 pm
. It was a couple hundred yards out, right off the parking lot.
*
Two members of
K pod
were encountered off
East Point
(Saturna Island), between
2-2.30pm
by the Ocean Magic. It looked like K20 and her youngster K38. Conditions were excellent for spotting other orca but alas, none were seen. Where was the rest of this family group I wonder?

You probably have gotten this by now, but six (likely Ks)
Orcas
were reprorted at the
County Park
yesterday morning about

9:00 AM
. By the time we got on scene,
10:15, there were two. K
20 and a calf, probably K38
. They headed N toward Turn Pt. then up Boundry toward the Coal Docks. I last saw them at

3:30
. The other four were never seen, as far as I know. In all my 20 yrs. watching Killer Whales, I've never seen just two SRKW's on their own for such a long time. Several years ago, I saw J1 nip at a female, and for the next few days she and her small line, three offspring as I remember, wandered the Islands by themselves for a week or so. Very interesting.
