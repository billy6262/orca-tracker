Orca Sightings for June 9, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was forwarded an e-mail and photos from Julia regarding a group of killer whales. She got some pretty good photos so hopefully someone can identify who this group of (transient?) killer whales is. Dawn Noren, NOAA Fisheries
Forwarded report: My name is Julia and I am working with pinnipeds at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR. On Tuesday I saw a group of at least
8 orcas
off the
central Oregon coast
traveling southwards, between

5:40 pm
and around

9:00 pm
. The group consisted of two big males (one of them has a very remarkable dorsal fin - looks like cut at the tip), several adult females and probably one calf. The first sighting was at
5:41 pm pretty close to the shore in Depoe Bay. They spent about 20 minutes in the bay before slowly traveling south. A sea lion was present but the orcas seemed not to be interested at all. I followed them and saw them again off Rocky Creek State Park, Otter Crest and Cape Foulweather. Off Rocky Creek they were playing (or hunting?) and breaching. One of the big males separated from the group (maybe with one or more group members) and continued traveling south. From time to time they swam farther off shore and were hard to see. I ended up watching at Moolack Beach where the they were pretty close to the beach again. They showed almost the same behavior as off Rocky Creek for at least an hour. Around sunset they swam farther off shore again and I lost sight.

We forwarded these photos to orca researchers and received the following replies:
"I can ID
T125 and T127
from the attached photos. It would be likely that both T125A and T128 would be present as well. These animals are usually seen near Langara Island so it's nice to have an encounter of them so far to the south. Jared Towers, Canada's DFO Pacific Biological Field Station, B.C. And from Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "Looks like
T125 and T127 plus others
."

K20 and K38
were spotted off the west side of
San Juan Island
around

10:30 a.m.
Center staff Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster responded to the sighting and encountered the duo off Battleship Rock (48째 36.980N; 123째 12.211W) at noon. The mother calf pair were traveling slow and tight heading north. The encounter ended at
12:48 pm at
Turn Point
with the whales continuing north toward Boundary Pass (48째 41.261 N; 123째 14.720 W).

The "fearsome twosome", "the dynamic duo",
K20 and K38
, continue to roam these parts, ending up tonight heading south just outside of the east entrance of
Active Pass at
6:15.

Linda Taylor from the Depoe Bay Whale Center called to relay a report of
8-9 orcas
, including 2 males, off
Depoe Bay, OR.
By the time Linda got out to see them they had headed west, out to sea.
*
Jeff Hogan called to relay reports of
orcas
off west San Juan Island at
10 am
, no ID on who it was at the time. (we believe this was likely K20 & K38, due to other reports)
*
Orca Network received a call from
Pt. Arena, CA
Lighthouse docent Brian Riehl (also a Pt. Arena city councilman), with a report of a pod of
at least 5 orcas
(he saw 4 or 5 surface at once for sure), including a small calf but no adult males present, about 1.5 - 2 miles off the Pt. Arena Lighthouse. He first saw a breach at
1 pm
, then only a spout & nothing more. Then at ~
1:45 pm he saw the group of 5, watched them milling & possibly feeding for about 10 minutes, then they just seemed to disappear, so he couldn't tell which direction they came from or left toward. He said they have had a sea lion colony there for the past week - in an area where they hadn't had sea lions for years, & this morning there were 2 dead sea lions on the beach, but they didn't have bites or teeth rake marks on them.
