We met up with the [
orcas
] crossing to San Juan Island. They had been traveling quite fast according to the other boats and they ended up splitting into 2 or more groups, with some whales moving towards the southern half of the island and others northbound up Haro Strait. The Orcas were quite spread out in all directions - apparently it was J pod and K pod. We had some wonderful views of 2 younger calves playing in the currents where the kelp was collecting, along with logs and other debris. One even draped a bit of kelp across its dorsal fin!! We moved north, from one group to another and left them off of
Kellet Bluff
, Henry Island as we looped around the north side of San Juan Island. Then the sunset tour.
J pod
had covered some ground and was up in the Canadian Gulf Islands. We were able to watch
J27 (Blackberry)
who at 18 is turning into quite the large male. Along with J27 was his sister J31 and a sprouter male who I believe was J34. We were able to also get great looks at
J26
, the other 18 year old male with his mom
J16
and younger sibling
J42
. Again very active tonight! Breach after breach, even by the little calf! The next family group included
J17, J28, and newborn J44?

Orcas
were heard off the
hydrophone
between

3:21pm to
3:40pm
PST. It sounded like around half a dozen as I heard 4-5 distinct calls.
