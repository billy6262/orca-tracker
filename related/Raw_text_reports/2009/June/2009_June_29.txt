Orca Sightings for June 29, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Reports were of
L's
off
Salmon Bank
, when we got out there at about

2:15pm
, there were many whales, at first appearing to forage with the minor ebb tide, then the orcas all came together heading toward the west. There were so many we wondered that there were more than L's. Sure enough some K's were with them as they went on a long dive, and surfaced northwest toward Eagle Cove. Another group of orcas approached from the southeast, looking like they were going to join the first big group, did a few tail lobs, then turned back to the west. The large group then turned and all the whales were joining up and speed swimming! toward the west when we left them at about

3:25pm
.

Orca Network received a call from John Barino of the Olympic Coast NMS - his family observed
3 - 4 orcas
including a young one from the Coho ferry (Victoria to Pt. Angeles) at
9 oclock
. We're assuming they may have been K or L pod whales, as they were seen heading out west that evening.

Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah departed Snug Harbor and encountered
K's and Ls
traveling south past
Open Bay
(48째 33.818 N; 123째 11.560 W) at
11:43 a.m. The whales were spread out along the west side of San Juan Island. At around
2:30 p.m. several L's grouped up and turned west toward the Strait of Juan de Fuca (48째 21.930 N; 123째 05.030 W). K's and L's continued traveling west spread out in groups.

We spotted two
minke
whales amongst the multiple bait balls forming at
Salmon Bank
(one of the minkes is the smallest I've ever seen, so perhaps it's a new calf?).

In big seas, we followed the
Ks and the Ls
that were headed West about 7 miles south of
Victoria
. The
Js
went North from
Turn Pt.
and I would think that we would see them today.

When we approached
Salmon Bank
south of the island, we could see a few boats in the distance, which was encouraging (
1315
). Soon we found our own little group of
orcas
to watch, and it was so thrilling to see how active the whales were. I couldn't ID one of the orcas that must have breached almost a dozen times in about 10 minutes as he was a bit far away. But we had no problems making an ID of
L41 Mega, L79 Skana, L88 Wavewalker
. These big boys have huge dorsal fins, which is also why we call them indicator whales (since these whales live with mom all their lives, if they are around, you know mom isn't too far away!) Soon our three "big boys" were joined by other members of their family.

K's
were milling off
Pile Point
around

9:30 a.m.
(probably earlier). Soon word was out that many whales were coming down from the north. Some of the K's went north to meet them. The whales coming south turned out to be many
L pod
whales. They swept the strait around noon as they came south on this beautiful day. Quite a sight--so many tall (male) fins! I heard people identify the L12's, L2's and L7's. The Center was out much of the day so they will be able to tell us if it was all of the L's. As I write this (
6:27 pm) the J's are reportedly up north perhaps near the coal docks. L's and K's are heading west. Hope they come back soon.

We heard some calls at about

12:05
on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
- so great to be able to listen to the whales even though we can't see them.

*
11 am
: Hearing a few SRKW calls (mostly S19s?) with nice "reverb" at
OrcaSound
hydrophones.
Scott Veirs, Beam Reach

There are a few Orcas, probably
L12,L-85,L-22, L-79 and L-89
down near
Eagle Pt
, San Juan Island right now (

8:20 am
).

Orca Network received a call from Arlene Sullivan on Mayne Island,BC, reporting a pod of
~10 orcas
including 2 males heading NE through
Active Pass
, just traveling, not stopping to feed, at

1:20 pm
*
At
0625
a few
orcas
passed
Point Roberts
heading Southeast. They were difficult to identify due to frigid strong winds whipping up 4 foot waves. They were just travelling through with scarce surfacings then long dives. It is possible that these were the trailers since I'm quite sure that there was a breach and some blows off in the distant rough waters earlier this morning.
Peter Hamilton, Lifeforce, Pt. Roberts

Orca Network received a call from Dave from Island Packers, on the Islander out of
Ventura, CA
- reporting ~
5-8 orcas
at 34 05.15N, 119 29.13W. The pod included 1 sprouter male, 1 adult female and several juveniles & sub-adults.

We continue to see the
minke
whale (again this morning) at the mouth of aleck bay, between swirl island and hughes bay, south end of
lopez
. It is there many mornings.
Sheila Bishop, Lopez Island
