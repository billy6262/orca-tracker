The NOAA Ship Miller Freeman had about
8-10 killer whales
, with no adult males, at the head of the Monterrey Canyon CA. I am still waiting for lat/longs from them. Unfortunately they did not get photos.

We were on our way to the Victoria area this afternoon to watch the 3
Transients
that had shown up there, when something in the water caught the eye of Captain John. We were just south of Beaver Point on
Saltspring Island
when
T20 and T21
surfaced. They were doing very long dives, 7-8 minutes at a time, and were likely resting. They still followed a zig-zagging pattern though, making it very difficult to predict where they would surface again. Given the long dives, it was pure chance that these whales were spotted at all. We left T20 and T21 after
4 PM
, travelling in a mostly northerly direction towards Navy Channel.

We had some
Transients
off
Quadra Island BC
today, found by "Neptune" (Simon). Identified as the
T2's
, possibly T90's and met up with T14.

We had a report of
Transients
at Constance Bank. Before long (about

3:30
), we were in sight of the orcas. The whales would occasionally pop up higher than normal when they exited a wave, making for some exciting viewing. After only 15 minutes however, the whales went on a long dive and we couldn't spot them anymore.

PDT; moving slowly N., surfacing briefly every minute or so.

minke
whale surfaced in front of my house on Klapache Ave NE going East; resurfaced under the Cliff House restaurant going toward the barges anchorage area and then disappeared.
