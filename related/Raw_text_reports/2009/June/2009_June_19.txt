On our afternoon trip,
J Pod
was spread out along Sturgeon Back, Strait of Georgia, from the South Arm to the North Arm of the
Fraser River
. There was obviously alot of foraging going on, but also a fair amount of socializing. We were priviliged to observe
J27
(Blackberry) and little brother
J39
(Mako) engaged in some playful behaviour. Photo of J39 doing a teasing spyhop. On the other boat, Sue (the Naturalist) reported
J42
(Echo) and little
J45
performing alternating spyhops, while the remainder of their matrilines milled nearby. It's fantastic to have J Pod back, foraging and socializing once again.

We saw our first
Orcas
of the year today off
Point Roberts
between

8:30 and
9:00 pm
. We were watching from the beach and spotted five whales with at least one large male in the group. They were moving quickly in the choppy seas with some breaching, tail slapping, and charging. As they passed the Point they headed South.

We got word from our friends, Jim and Brenda, that they had seen
Orcas
this morning at
Turn Pt
. So at 10 this morning we headed for
Active Pass
and got there in time to see them come out of the Pass headed East. As usual they were very active as they came out of the Pass. We left
Js
headed south this evening at

7:00 PM
at
Pt. Roberts
.

What with the wind, the waves, the flood tide and meeting up with the
L12's
once again. We saw a total of 8 whales on my first Zodiac trip at noon. Initially we found five off by themselves including three big boys and two females at
Constance Bank
, then later encountered Mega L41, and his sisters L77 and L94, closer to shore. The
3.30pm
Ocean Magic encountered Mega, L41 and Alexis L12, heading out west, past Metchosin, Vancouver Island between
4-5pm
. Other whales were seen in the distance but too far to ID.
