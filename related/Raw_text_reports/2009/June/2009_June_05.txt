Entry 1:
The pictures of the
gray whale

Sekiu River

Saw what appeared to be the
Grey whale(s)
again off the Nor'Wester building and the west runway (
NAS Whidbey
, NW Whidbey Isl). Appeared to be about 150ish yards out and seemed to be staying in one place, coming closer to land then moving back out to the sound. Looked like two of them spouting for about a min. then they would dive for about 10 mins. Watched them for about 45 mins around
1630
. Saw the same two boats as Chuck Niedzialkowski saw on
June 4th and they were indeed close to the whales but had motors off. Perhaps the whales were swimming to them?
