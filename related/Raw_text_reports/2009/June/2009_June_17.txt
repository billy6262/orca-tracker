Orca Sightings for June 17, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went to
Whidbey Island
to see not one, but two
gray whales
. We think one appeared to be a bit larger than the other.

A group of 5 of the
L-12, L-22's
in a fairly close formation, slowly swimming from the
Salmon Bank
buoy northwest toward San Juan Island, from

12:55pm to
1:50pm
. At first they seemed to be traveling in 2 groups, then all 5 came together, and appeared to be resting in the slack flood tide with little tidal exchange. I could ID L-12, L-89 (Solstice near the Solstice!), and not sure, but think the other male was L-85, along with 2 other females. The sun glinting off their backs and through the spray of their exhalations, the 2 males shoulder to shoulder coming up together, was beautiful, but made it difficult to ID.

Ken Balcomb encountered the
L12's
spread out a few miles off
False Bay
on the west side of San Juan Island at

10:45 a.m
. The whales were very spread out and the conditions were poor. Only L89 and L94 were documented, but reports confirm that all of the L12's were in the area.

We left the
L12s
, which I think is a new resident pod, off of
False Bay
, West Side,
San Juan Island
, today at

5:00 PM
going East down island. Update: Orcas about
9 PM
headed N past
Hannah Hts, San Juan Island
.

I was out on a Zodiac today at
1pm
and we caught up with the
L12s
at
Cattle Point , San Juan Island
. They were foraging with a few tail slaps and one mighty breach from Mega - too bad I missed it. Just looked the wrong way at that moment. Happened so fast and he never did it again. They were travelling slowly north close to shore.

We had the
L-22s, L-22, L-89, L-79
and and additional whale
L-77
, I believe, off the westside of
San Juan Island
. Lots of back and forth activity, at one point L-22 was bracketed by both her much bigger sons.

Bob Morrow called with a report of at least
two orcas
headed north at
7 PM
this evening, within a hundred yards of shore near
Langlois OR
, north of Cape Blanco, south of Bandon.
*
Orca Network received a 2nd hand report of the
gray whales
off
NW Whidbey
in the
afternoon
.
*
3 orcas
straight out from
south beach
moving further out away from
SJI
west. They were little dots in my viewfinder w my 400mm lens on.
