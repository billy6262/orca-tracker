Orca Sightings for June 14, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I just heard from my husband, Bill Bailey, captain of the Catalyst that they encountered this week, about
25 orcas
, that appeared to be fish eating residents rather than transients. They were a mix of older whales and youngsters and there were fish jumping around. They were sighted south of Port Snettisham, near the
Midway Islands in Stephen's Passage AK
.

We saw 3
Orcas
around

2:25 pm
in
Nehalem Bay, OR
. We were around 250 yards from the Mouth of Nehalem Bay when they swam about 10 to 15 feet right past us. We later viewed them around 3pm for about 10 or 15 minutes & were literally with in touching distance of them as I think they were just playing with us. They certainly touched my sons & my life.
