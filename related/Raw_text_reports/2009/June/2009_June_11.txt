Orca Sightings for June 11, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
From the website: "Orcas in
Neskowin OR
:" The third photo shows five spouts as the
orcas
work in unison to capture a meal. I don't know if they were successful. But the sea lions were barking quite a bit. The fourth photo has an inset showing a close-up of the whale in the photo.

We had an incredible experience today with the
L12's and K20 and K38
off San Juan Island, offshore from
Cattle Point
!! Lots of playing, multiple breaches by K38, and lots of tail lobbing!

Dave Anderson called to relay a report from Brett Ginther of Deception Pass Tours - Brett was almost certain he saw a
Humpback
Whale east of
Deception Pass State Park
just outside Deception Pass.

We caught up with the
L12 sub-group
off of the
south end of San Juan Island
today. They were traveling mainly along the coastline, but at South Beach they took a right turn and moved offshore. L41 "Mega" was seen as well as L12 "Alexis" who was photographed by one of our guests. The group as a whole was very active with lots of seemingly playful behavior occuring, like multiple spyhops by one animal, repetitive tail lobbing by a juvenile and an adult that rolled over behind our boat and proceeded to beat the water with a pectoral flipper. The animals would bunch-up and then separate and were continuing to move further offshore when we departed the scene at

2:45 PM
