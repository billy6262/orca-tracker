Orca Sightings for June 16, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Attached (not pictured) is a close-up photo of one of the
2 [gray] whales
we observed just off of the north end of
West Beach Road
(a mile south of the Navy Base) -
2 PM
. The south end of Lopez Island is way off in the background. This one just about came under our boat, while we were drifting with the engine off! This whale is one of two now moving south, parallel to West Beach Road, just about where it intersects with Ft Nugent Road about

2:30 PM.
Maybe the patches will help ID.
Rudy and Barbara Deck, Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island
Thanks to Rudy and Barbara's great photos, Cascadia Research was already able to ID the whale pictured above: Amber Klimek, our primary gray whale matcher, took a look at the whale in the photos Barbara Deck took on the 16th and found it in our catalogs this afternoon. It is CRC-396, first seen in 1999 in Disco Bay, Northern Puget Sound, and last seen in 2006 off British Columbia. In the years between, it's been spotted in the summer months hanging out near southwest Vancouver Island, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and off the Northern Washington Coast. Thanks for the great photos!

Al Pizar called to report approx.
5 orcas
4-5 miles off
Yachats OR
at

2:50 PM
, in water 32 fathoms deep, at 48.17.8N by 124.12.06W. There were 1 or 2 males and 2 or 3 females or juveniles, headed SW. His buddy saw them tear a seal lion in half. He says there are lots of resident gray whales there.

In the
morning
Five Star Whale Watching's vessel Fastcat, discovered two large
Humpback
Whales near the Victoria Golf Buoy heading East. The two Humpbacks were being very lathargic when first sighted, doing 5-6 minute dives. However, as we continued to observe the two Humpback Whales they did begin to become more active and later in the morning a double breach was seen. The last reports of the Humpback Whales were that they were near
Port Angeles
.

The pair of
humpback
whales south of
Victoria
were BCY0160 and BCX1057. They were last seen north of Port Angeles. Both animals are regular visitors in our waters.

Just as I informed my passengers that we no longer knew where the
Humpbacks
were came news of the
L12s
inbound. We were off and saw them both on our afternoon and evening trips. They were West of
Victoria
. The L12s right now are off
False Bay
, San Juan Island headed toward Eagle Pt.

Tom Trumper called to report seeing
4-6 orcas
at
10 AM
, about 4 miles out from
Westport CA
, near Ft. Bragg. No obvious males were in the group, which was headed generally north.
*
I spotted the first
minke
I've seen in ages today. About
6pm
one passed briefly off Flint Beach, South Lopez. It wasn't too far past the kelp line and I saw it going both eastbound and westbound in the three or four times I managed to spot it.

Race Rocks
, heading in, at around
4 pm
. We had another indirect report they were off Secretary Island, off
Victoria
around
6 pm
