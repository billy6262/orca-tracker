I spent a lot of time at
Lime Kiln Park
and was able to photograph the
J Pod
orcas on Friday, twice on Saturday, and again on Sunday. On Saturday, they went north and then came back later that day. I was so glad I stayed as little J45 was practicing his breaching for a good half hour.

Tagging on to Jeff and Cathy's reports of calls on the HPs on Sunday. I was at
LimeKiln
and have posted a video clip of Samish J-14 and her three youngest -
Hy'Shqa J-37, Suttles J-40
and baby
J-45
as they spent time there. It was interesting that with all their activity there were more echo clicks than vocals. Was it a training session or just lunch time?

We had
J-Pod riding in the huge flood tide
. When we were getting ready to leave the dock, we had a report that J Pod was at Constance Bank heading east, so we hoped they'd be somewhat close by the time we got in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. By the time we made Cattle Point, they were already along the shore of San Juan (must have been the 6 knot current speeding them along!) They were
very spread ou
t, making any ID's very hard, but I did manage to spot J27 near False Bay. For our second trip in the late afternoon, the whales had made a decision to head north, and we found the trailing whales near
Stuart Island
. This time however, things were different. The currents were almost ebbing, so the whales had slowed way down. We were lucky enough to find two good-sized groups traveling closely together, and not in a big hurry. Lots of spyhops, tail lobs, rolling on top of each other, and even a sea-snake! We were able to ID
J16 Slick, J17 Princess Angeline, J22 Oreo, J27 Blackberry, J28 Polaris, J34 Doublestuff, J35 Tahlequah, J38 Cookie, and new calf J44
. We watched the whales pass the Turn Point Lighthouse before heading home, full of smiles!
