About

3 Grays

Camano
, they were the closest I have ever seen. they hung around for about half hour.

After having an amazing encounter with small groups of
Dall's Porpoises
, literally 100's of
Harbor Porpoises
, and about a dozen
Steller Sea Lions
feeding on Skates off of Patos Island this afternoon, we found

I have a couple of reports this morning. I spotted about 6 maybe 8
Dall's porpoises
at

8:10 and
9:20 AM
east of
Langley
. They were frequently changing direction, possibly chasing fish? Also, at

9:00 AM
, I saw a
gray whale
spout near Camano, opposite Langley and headed to the east. The whale is now off the Head of Camano (

9:45 AM
) and moving towards the bar that extends out towards Hat Island.
