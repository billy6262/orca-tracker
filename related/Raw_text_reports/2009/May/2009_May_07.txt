Orca Sightings for May 7, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

4:19 p.m.
Center staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and guest John Boyd responded to a report of
Transients
off
Kelp Reef
as well as
J pod
off the South end of San Juan Island. The
T71's
(T71, T71A and T71B) and
T40
were encountered at

4:33 p.m.
just north of
Kelp Reef
(48° 33.15 N, 123° 13.54 W). The whales were actively hunting a Steller Sea Lion. The transients continued to attack the sea lion for about an hour. The sea lion was determined to have been killed around
6:00 p.m. At
6:21 the encounter ended and the transients continued traveling slowly north at (48° 34.39 N, 123° 13.48 W). Center staff continued down the west side of San Juan Island in search of J pod.

Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and guest John Boyd encountered
J pod 1.5 miles off Hannah Heights
(48° 29.08 N, 123° 07.31 W) at

6:53 p.m.
The whales were spread out in groups and traveling west. The encounter ended a few miles off False Bay 48° 27.13 N, 123° 06.58 W), at

7:59 p.m.
with the whales heading steadily southwest.

Best I have had at the dog house (downtown
Langley
) in some time.
Patch
and his friend spent about 15-20 minutes just lollygagging about 150 meters from shore, showing their entire bodies and slowly rolling along almost like a chorus line.

Transients
were between
Discovery & San Juan Islands
heading north. After watching the Transients, we decided to head down towards
False Bay
to see
J-Pod
. We did manage to spot J17 and new calf J44, along with J16, J26, J27, J41.The Residents were quite spread out over several miles and were meandering slowly towards the southeast. I had the opportunity to go out and see "Captain Hook" (
T40
) and the other
transients
, and witness a rare interaction between the Transients & a Steller Sea Lion. The 5 transients spent over an hour and a half toying with the sea lion, occasionally letting it "get away" before they'd lunge after it. The two younger whales were obviously practicing their techniques, and we kept wondering if they were just toying with the sea lion or if they'd really eat it. Finally, after 90 minutes of this behavior, they decided to eat and the steller was pulled below the surface and all five orcas disappeared for several minutes. When they returned to the surface, there was no sign of the sea lion.

The Ocean Magic spent time with Capt. Hook,
T40
this
afternoon
. He was with four other
Transient
Orca. Possibly three females and a youngster. This was my first ever observation of this male with a distinct looking dorsal fin (see photo below). He sure is an old male Orca.

I am listening to what sounds like
J pod
calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
at
8 p.m.
We heard calls on the OrcaSound (further N. on SJI) hydrophone at
6:07 pm, then began hearing calls at Lime Kiln at
7:33 pm, so they must be moving south.

Around
7-8pm
there were
orca
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
, they kept getting weaker and weaker as the 8pm hour arrived. Could not tell which direction the whales were heading Great to hear them though.

6:57 pm
- Faint Calls on Lime Kiln Hydrophones.

7:40 pm
- Calls getting louder on Lime Kiln Hydrophone. Sounds possibly like J pod.

Got a call from Shane about a report of
orcas
in the south end of
Bellingham Channel
headed south. Went upstairs to the scope and saw at least three groupings of orcas cruising past Fidalgo Head toward Burrows Island lighthouse in Rosario Strait. Saw Ruffles and two other sprouted males, a tiny babe, and some activity: spy hops, tummy-up tail lobs and pec fin slaps. They were going at a pretty good clip, I'm guessing with the ebb tide.

Orca Network received a call from KING 5 TV, relaying a report of a whale in S. Puget Sound, between Anderson Island and Steilacoom this morning, but had no further details. Thanks to Gary Chittam for getting in the air with the KING 5 chopper this afternoon to try to locate the whale, to confirm whether it might be the Humpback reported the past two days - they found the whale and confirmed it was a
Humpback
, at

2:15 pm
, off the SW corner of the
Key Peninsula
& Anderson Island at 47 12.42 N, 122 44.16 W.

Just to let you know I had an excited telephone call from my Mum in
Ladysmith (Vancouver Island) B.C.
today around
5.30 pm
- she was watching
four Orcas
from her condo looking down on to Transfer Beach, Ladysmith. They were in full activity mode with plenty of seagulls hanging around. Orcas here are not a common sight.

4:03 pm
- calls on
OrcaSound hydrophones
now - seeing
Transient T40
plus others.
4:06 pm - Transients were going after a sea lion, was hoping to capture more calls.

First the
Transients
off of
Discovery Island
, then the
Js
at Iceberg Pt., then more Transients on the way home at Kelp Reef eating a Steller. Also, observed and photographed a bleeding Steller sea lion off Whale Rocks today off of south Lopez Is. I don't know about the small one. We hardly ever see them in here.

This evening at

6:10 two gray whales
came by from the NW to SE feeding in the shallow water in front of
Langley
. The whales were being very shy about showing either the knuckles on their backs or the underside of their flukes. I took this shot (see photo below) of one of the flukes and it looks like Patch #49.

Moments ago (
5pm
) one, maybe two,
GRAY WHALE
FEEDING AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR BLUFF. We are 80 ft above sea level at this spot, looking down on the popular feeding waters (about 12 ft deep) for migrating gray whales - west end of First St,
Langley
. We couldn't get a fix on which way they were headed. They were feeding slowly and leisurely. And looking at the calendar, we know this may be one of the final sightings this season.

Steve Schrader called at

2:35 pm
to report a small
gray whale
(~20') about 60' offshore of West Beach/Hastie Lake Rd. on NW Whidbey. His description of it rolling on its side, pecs & fluke tips above water, then spouting, sounded like feeding behavior.
*
Donald Looff of Oak Harbor called to report one
Gray whale
inside the kelp bed off
West Beach
, Hastie lake area, NW Whidbey Island at
10 am
, feeding in 10' deep water. He called back to report it again at
3 pm
, heading NW.
*
We received a call from Karen Morton at

9:06 am
, reporting one, maybe two
Gray whales
moving slowly in
Port Susan
1/4 mile off Bech #2, Country Club area, SE
Camano Island
.

Florian Graner of Sea-Life productions in Freeland called to report a very unusual sighting that seems incredible to both him & us! He was out boating and diving in
Saratoga Passage
, and around noon came across a whale in about 10' of water off
Baby Island
. He has been watching the Gray whales (and is a marine biologist), but said this was not a Gray - it was
creamy white in color, ~20' long, no dorsal fin, and a single blow-hole
(Grays & all baleen whales have 2 blow holes). The whale swam close around their boat, nearly touching the swim step, so they got a good look at it, but unfortunately no photos. It would spout every 60 - 70 seconds. The only marine mammal that comes close to this description is a Beluga whale, which is not found in these waters.
