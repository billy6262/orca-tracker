Orca Sightings for May 16, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just off Partridge Pt. west side of Whidbey about 2 miles
southwest of Smith Island
. The friend I was with said she also saw two minkes, where they blew and dove among the boats for a long while.

We live on
south Camano
, and for the last few days one to
two gray whales
have been cruising by our home on Gull Way in the late afternoon regularly. On
May 16th, Saturday, we witnessed a very upsetting occurrence with a boat interfering with two whales' progress.
*
We were on the road to
lime kiln
around

6:45 pm
and saw the two adult whales, but we saw three babies. Two were still small, and one was very tiny, smaller than the two. It looks like it was
J pod, J44 and J45
, but who was that small-small one? It almost looked like a porpoise, and if we didn't hear it's exhalation, we thought it just might be. One of the bigger but still small babies, stayed near an adult. The other bigger small baby swam a little bit away, and the tiny one stayed with that one. And the other adult stayed in closer to shore?

There were T's everywhere out west in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
. They were seen 2-5 miles south and
west of Race Rocks
. I have never seen so many in one day. Such an awesome spectacle. The early afternoon trip at
12.15pm
caught up with playful Transients, possibly 10-12 that had probably just eaten. Their behaviour included several breaches and tail lobbing activity. T102, the big bull, was obvious on both the trips. His dorsal fin reminded me of 'Faith, 'L 57'. The later trip at
3.30pm
, saw most of the T's in separate groups, heading fast out west past Sheringham Lighthouse. There could have been 15-20 or more in total at that time. Mark Malleson our Expert on T's, here in Victoria, identified many of the groups seen in the Strait.

Calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
- for a couple minutes then faded out beginning at
1748
, it's 1752 now. Update at
8 pm: Still hearing calls
, squeeks, and what sounded like possible echolocation? (sounds like tapping on metal..) I think the echolocation was happening during what sounded like some blow hole burps, very low sounding squeeks (like a human with gas! hah) so was assuming they were possibly hunting some fish/prey? It went on and off for about 30-40 minutes, never really fading out, staying in the same area and very clear. The echolocation was very loud. A little bit after 1900, for about a half hour, and now I'm getting ALOT of noise of squeeks, and squeals and calls!!! It's not extremely loud, but it's very audible. I started listening at 1738, got calls at 1748 and continued until now (
2000
), and we are
still getting them
. More the squeeks and squeals this time. Sounds like several, rather than a few? I'm just learning the hydrophone listening.

From

5:30-
7:30 PM

J-Pod
head slowly south past
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
.

J pod
went south past Landbank between

5:20pm and
5:50pm
, traveling slowly and widely spread on glassy water. When we returned from a tasty and fun Whale Museum Greeting Ceremony benefit dinner (a big thank you to all those who worked so hard to put this event on),
J16
and her family were hanging out at
Landbank
at about
9pm
, heading south but being pushed by the flood tide north. The "whoosh," "whoosh's" were loud and magical. After staying in the same hundred yards or so for at least a half hour, J16 and family picked up speed and began traveling south. It was getting pretty dark by this time. Almost as soon as the J16's moved south, J27 and his siblings appeared, whoosh, whooshing and moving south. Three whales came within 10 yards of shore, Ruffles (J1) and Granny (J2) and another whale that I could not identify by sight, but that had a familiar whistle--must be Speiden (J8) I'm thinking. Ruffles' exhalations in such still air exploded in the night. As I wrote this, faint calls at the LimeKiln hydrophones were becoming louder, but after boat noise came and went, the calls have disappeared, at least for now.
