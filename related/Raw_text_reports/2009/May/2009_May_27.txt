This afternoon (approx.

2:15-
2:45 PM
) from the Western Explorer we observed
a gray whale
just offshore of the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. It appeared to be feeding as every once and a while a brown plume of mud was visible at the surface.

Jesse Huggins at Cascadia Research writes: Jill sent some photos of the left side of the same whale as well. This is one of the whales new to the area this year.

Chuck Niedzialkowski reported
two gray whales
about 100 yards off
Whidbey Naval Air Station
for several hours from
noon to about
2:45
.

We watched
a gray whale
feeding along the west side of Whidbey near Rocky Point, south of the main part of the Navy base. We watched him for about 45 minutes around
1 pm
. He was in fairly shallow water, and didn't ever show his fluke. I think he's one of the newcomers for 2009.

Gray whale at Spee-Bi-Dah We just had (

9:30am to
10:00am
)
a grey whale
feeding 50 to 75 yards off shore at Spee-Bi-Dah. We have not seen this whale this year. Tail and fin markings are not like any others we have seen this year. Also so was much lighter in color. The feeding pattern was different. Instead of the normal roll and dip this one seem to sink with very little fin and tail action.
