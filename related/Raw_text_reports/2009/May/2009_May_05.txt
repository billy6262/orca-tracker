Orca Sightings for May 5, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research responded to a report of
J pod
on the
west side of San Juan Island
. At

5:48 p.m.
the
J14's
were encountered traveling slowly toward the southeast just off
False Bay
(48째 27.61 N, 123째 06.58 W). The K13's soon join up with the J14's and begin heading northwest. At
7:40 p.m. Dave finds the J22's followed by the J16's. The whales were spread out in groups all traveling north at a slow pace. The encounter ended 1 mile west of Lime Kiln State Park (48째 30.95 N, 123째 10.22 W) at
8:20 p.m. Above reports from Center for Whale Research

I left
J pod
and, at least, the
K13's
at
2030
heading north at
Lime Kiln
spread out in small groups. The whales were too spread out and I didn't have enough light to find everybody but both calves were looking good and I saw K13, K25, K27, and K34 mixed in with the J's.

I got my first good look at the whales this year. It was so good to see
J pod
all afternoon, then listen to them most the night, barring ship noise. I saw both of the newest calves, J44 and J45 for the first time. Both were romping around, tail slapping, bouncing, and turning and twisting on the surface. J44 practiced his/her swan dives frequently and spent a lot of time close to J28, with J17 and J35 sticking fairly close. They joined with J8, J27, J31, J39, J19 and J41 and spent some time socializing and "foraging" as a group at Hannah Heights before moving north at around 4p.m. and continuing to "forage". All the orcas stalled out for awhile, with the northernmost whales at Lime Kiln, the southernmost off Land Bank, and J1, J2 and reportedly the J16's about 1-2 miles offshore. At about
4:45pm they headed south again. This time I got a photo of K20. (I thought there were too many whales to be just J pod. Later I learned that the K13's had been spotted by others.) During the time I watched the whales (about
2pm to
6:30pm
) they seemed to be not in the constant search for food/traveling mode that was so prevalent last year, but more relaxed and less purposeful. There was lots of social activity and lots of hanging out. Hope this continues. I also saw my first sea snake of the year-either J27 or J30, but couldn't accurately identify b/c they were traveling together and I couldn't find an ID catalog for this body part.
