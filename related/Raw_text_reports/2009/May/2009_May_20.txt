Orca Sightings for May 20, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod with some K's
traveling north against an ebbing tide in Haro Strait from

1:15pm to
2:30pm
. The family groups were loosely spread out diving and foraging, then showed an array of behaviors as they closed in on Stuart Island; fluke and pectoral slaps, a few breaches, lunges, and flashes of male parts! (It'll be interesting to see if there are any new calves, in about a year and a half, from those K-13/ K-20 girls!!)

Today we came across
J Pod
in
Haro Strait
headed north toward Stuart Island at

1:30 p.m
. We watched
Granny (J-2) and Ruffles (J-1)
as they headed up the pod working their way north. The whales were in sub pod family groups, with lots of tail slapping going on, some foraging, and lots of traveling behavior. Big brother,
Riptide (J-30)
was right with his new sibling J-14's new calf. It was a beautiful day on the water with the added bonus of sunshine and warm temperatures. We left J pod as they headed north past Turn Point on Stuart Island, at

2:40 p.m
.

Orca Network got a call (

7:30 pm
) from Blaine Galanty in
Brookings, OR
with a real time report of
at least 4 orcas
, milling rapidly in the same spot for about a half hour before the fog rolled in, under many birds, about 2-3 hundred yards from Chetco Point. He said it looked like they were "chowing down". He says there have been a lot of seals and sea lions around there recently.
