Orca Sightings for May 25, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had an incredible experience with a
gray whale
off Bells Beach on
Whidbey Island
around

12:30 pm
. It was a very low tide and I had just brought our boat in and was preparing the anchor when a gray whale came up about 10 feet away - right off shore (the tide was all the way out to the drop-off so it got deep quick). The whale slowly traveled north along the shoreline. At one point I was able to wade out about waist deep and the whale came up about 5 feet away - I could almost touch its tail as it went by (I know I shouldn't have gotten so close but could not resist). He/she appeared to be feeding and came up numerous times without blowing and also rolling on its side and raising a fin, presumably while scooping up goodies on the seabed. My wife jogged along with the whale almost all the way to fox spit where the whale eventually steered out towards Camano and did a terminal dive. Others on the beach were taking pictures so I will try to get copies and forward them along.

a gray whale in Holmes Harbor
, Saratoga Passage, and the Rocky Point boat ramp. It was a low tide and the whale was in about 10-12' of water. He saw it
