Orca Sightings for May 22, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spent a lot of time at
Lime Kiln Park
and was able to photograph the
J Pod
orcas on Friday, twice on Saturday, and again on Sunday. On Saturday, they went north and then came back later that day. I was so glad I stayed as little J45 was practicing his breaching for a good half hour.

We had a great encounter with
J pod
today. We travelled quite far south of Vancouver towards the Juan de Fuca Straight and found
J pod not far off of Smith Island
. We found J14 with new calf J45 (see photo) and his siblings, including Big brother J30. We travelled back home along the west side of San Juan Island, where we saw J1 all by himself. He was quite far away from the rest of the pod, but we were happy to have a look at him and get away from the wind.

Orca Network received a report of
a gray whale near Everett at
9:30
, near the white bouy.

Just in from an exciting ride in Mark's Zodiac,
west of Race Rocks
, where we caught up with the
K13 family group of 6 whales
. Mark Malleson had spotted this group on an earlier trip. They were bucking a flood tide with 2-3ft chop at 2pm and moving fast. No time for foraging, although one seem to stall for a moment and possibly catch a fish or two. Plenty of white caps out there, near Church Rock, Sooke where we met up with them. Difficult to see these whales at times and to anticipate where they would surface due to the waves, but a great trip anyhow. We left them heading west still.

We sighted
J pod
foraging in small scattered groups of
4-7 orcas
each. Tail whack after tail whack, and numerous breaches, even a bit of la amour- amour. I positively I D'd
J17
and baby
J44
riding high over her back. And
J27
- Blackberry. All sightings 2-3 miles S.W. off
Iceberg Point
in the Juan de Fuca. The children also enjoyed a pod (20-30) of
Harbour porpoises
, S.E. of Colville Is.
