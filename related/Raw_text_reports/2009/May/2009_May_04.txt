Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb and Erin Heydenreich of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J pod
traveling north at

4:02 P.M
., just off Thieves Bay,
Pender Island
, B.C.(48째 47.384 N; 123째 19.350W). The whales were spread out in groups and traveling slow. At approximately
4:45 p.m. the whales grouped up and headed through Active Pass, (48째 51.327 N; 123째 20.452 W) where the encounter ended due to rain.

It was soooo great to finally get the news -
J Pod
was back in town. The last I heard was about

4:30
and they were in
Active Pass
headed North.

J-Pod
is absent no longer!!! After 44 days, J-Pod made a special appearance on the west side of San Juan! Luckily The whales were spread out from one side of Haro Strait to the other, and they would speed up for awhile, and then take their time and zig-zag around randomly (well, it appears random to us on the surface.) After hearing about new babies all these weeks, I was finally able to see with my own eyes J14 and her new calf J45! He's (well, we'll use artistic license and say "he") sure was active as he'd surface so exuberantly! We also spotted J1 Ruffles off in the distance (about half a mile away and still so recognizable!) J30 is surely sprouting big time and it was so good to see everyone once again. I heard from Jeanne Hyde that K20 had been spotted earlier in the day, but we only saw J's in the afternoon.

Leslie Veirs reported Southern Resident
orcas
off San Juan Island at
Orca Sound hydrophones
at

12:25 pm
, heading
north
.

I took a pic from shore at about

12:20
as the whales were going north, just north of
Andrews Bay
- they looked like they were coming across the strait and heading up - they were way far out and the only identifiable image I got was K-20.

Sharon Grace of San Juan Island called at

11:10 am
to report
K's and/or L's
in a resting pattern south of
San Juan Island
.

J pod
came in past Clover Point to
Haro Strait
this morning, but it is too windy for us to go out, or even see them.

We received a call from Mark Malleson of Prince of Whales at

10:45 am
reporting
J POD
heading NE past
Oak Bay/Victoria B.C.
toward San Juan Island! Another group of orcas was sighted by others south of Discovery Island, heading east in rough waters, but no ID's on them at the time.

Jennifer Barwick called at

2:55 pm
to report a
humpback
whale mid-sound between
N. Vashon Island and W. Seattle
, heading north quickly. She then sent this update, with photos: Wow this whale was so exciting to watch I couldn't get any decent photos. The whale was spotted off W Seattle (south of Fauntleroy) and heading north, fast. My neighbors and I saw 2-3 full breaches. Seemed to be only one solo whale. I'm sure it was a humpback because of the very long pectoral fins I saw when it breached. It was half-way out in the sound so too far to get any close up shots. Hope other get so it this whale in action.
Jennifer Barwick, Seattle
Jennifer's photos of the dorsal fin and fluke confirm this was a
humpback
- also the size of the splash in the photo of the after-breach! SB
