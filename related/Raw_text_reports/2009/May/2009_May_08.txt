Orca Sightings for May 8, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
After a brief visit with some
Dall's Porpoises
in the middle of the
Strait of Georgia
, we encountered
J Pod
a little further south, shortly
before noon
, with flat calm conditions. The pod was spread out over miles, and were travelling slowly southeast in matriline groups. Our boat first encountered the J2 Matriline, with new calf J45. It was thrilling to see J Pod again after a long winter, and even better to see that all the whales look fat and healthy. It warmed my heart to see Granny take a turn at babysitting the little one - photo attached (see above - aaaww!) (zoomed and cropped). We also had an opportunity to visit with the J17 group (Princess Angeline and family). Little J44 seems to be quite the explorer, often swimming ahead of the remainder of the family, and showing off some fine tail slaps as well. We were fortunate to also encounter J16 and family after our visit with gray whales. This group was the furthest east, and were just rounding the tip of Point Roberts, travelling in about 10 feet of water, heading towards Boundary Bay. For all the distance that the pod was spread, we heard no vocals on the hydrophone, just some echolocation clicks.

I saw
Orcas
!! I was fishing for rockfish in my kayak off
Cherry Point
just south of Point Whithorn. At like
6.30
or so I heard what I thought to be a whale exhale Like 10 minutes later I hear it again and realize it really is something. Look around and sure enough a top fin of a killer whale goes up and down like 250 yards away! Then I realize there are like 3 or 4!! The others are spread way out, it amazed me how far apart they were. They were all traveling south parallel with the coast heading toward Sandy Point only like 1/4 mile past the refinery docks. Watched for like 15 minutes as they moved south, slowly. Definitely traveling. Go back to fishing and out of nowhere a whale surfaces like 125 yards in front of me! Right in front of the refinery dock! He was traveling too, parallel with the coast. On his 3rd rise he turns right at me!!!!! His next rise right at me!!!! I freaked out. This giant, intelligent creature oriented it's self toward me. I thought he would come right under me and was I scared, he probably felt that cuz he didn't surface again till he was like 100 yards away back on the southern course. He then did like 4 circles nice and slow then I didn't see him again. It was weird, he didn't rise and I was looking. Then saw the biggest fin by far heading south was out there. He was far but I could still tell it was the biggest. It was special. No one to share it with but you so thanks.

Not sure, but this was likely part of J pod, who had been seen further north earlier in the day traveling south slowly and spread out - sb

We have received several reports into our office today indicating the
Humpback whale
was near
Cooper Point
mid-afternoon then went down into
Eld Inlet
before heading out and apparently north up the west side of Hartestine Island.

3:30 p.m.
- We spotted a single
gray whale
close to shore about 3 miles north of
Langley
. He slowly moved south and passed us almost in front of the Inn at Langley at about
4:30 p.m. then turned back north as we headed into the Marina.

Around

2:30
my kids and I got to see a few
grey whales
feeding out off
West Beach
(maybe 2 right out from the parking area south of the beach houses across from Swan Lake) and another south towards the Hastie Lake RD area. We saw lots of spouts/backs (but no flukes). They stayed in those areas until at least
3:25 when they disappeared as quickly as they arrived.

Drew Dixon of Langley called to report that several kayakers in their Kayak club saw a total of
8 Gray whales early afternoon
in N. Puget Sound. Drew saw 1 Gray whale in the north end of
Port Susan
, 1 mile south of Triangle Cove
mid- channel
, and 2 others along the west side of the north end
Pt. Susan
. Fred Geisler saw 4 Gray whales in Saratoga Passage, just north of
Langley
, and Ken Bittle saw 1 Gray whale south of
Kayak Pt
, near Tulalip.
*
There are still four
Gray Whales
in
Boundary Bay
. Three of the animals we observed today have been there since at least the middle of April, and at least one also visited Boundary Bay in 2007. As with our other encounters with the Grays in Boundary Bay, the whales seemed to be swimming in large circles. No foraging events were observed today. We wonder how much longer they will stay.

A whale seen at

7:30 pm
outside our home by the Harstene Island bridge (S. Puget Sound). Was a surprise - saw the water blow and the whale surface. All I could see was a top fin I think. He then proceeded farther toward the bridge and out of view surfacing to blow but not out of the water as far as he had. Would love if you could tell me what type it might be?

It's possible this is the Humpback whale that has been sighted in the Seattle and So. Puget Sound area the past several days - sb

J pod

Lime Kiln Hydrophone
at

2:23am

Between

5:00 PM and
6:00 PM
. We had a
gray whale
that stayed northwest of
Langley
for over an hour! The whale would roll on to it's side and feed for a dozen or so times, head out to deeper water and loop back for more feeding. I was unable to ID the whale but forwarded on some of the pics I took. Also took some shots of a kayaker who drifted in a little close, but then headed off. The whale was unperturbed. While I was photographing that whale, I spotted another gray whale heading to Camano, diving deep and showing its flukes. At
7:30 PM the same gray whale has returned, traveling from SE to NW, Continuing to feed close to shore.

At
1:00pm on the beach between
Bells Beach and Eastpoint
we heard a blow. There was a lone
Grey
traveling very slowly parallel to the beach headed towards Eastpoint. I was a bit concerned because he was no more than 15-20' off shore in very shallow water. He was rolling often and popped his head out to look at us a couple times as we followed him for about a mile. When he rolled it appeared to me that his right fluke had been either worn down or sheered on the end. He was around 35' long with lots of barnacles on him. When we got to the point at #3 past the spit where the water depth drops off we lost sight of him as he seemed to be headed towards Holmes Harbor.

One
gray whale
spent about 40 minutes in front of our house happily eating shrimp. The whale (and perhaps a second) were just about fifty yards offshore in front of our house.
