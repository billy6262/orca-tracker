Orca Sightings for May 23, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spent a lot of time at
Lime Kiln Park
and was able to photograph the
J Pod
orcas on Friday, twice on Saturday, and again on Sunday. On Saturday, they went north and then came back later that day. I was so glad I stayed as little J45 was practicing his breaching for a good half hour.

11:53 am
near the south bound shipping lane
between Shilshole Bay and Bainbridge Island
. Lat 47 41.89N; Long 122 27.15 W. There were about 5-6 whales including one adult male and one juvenile.

The bull is T102. Along with T101 (frame 56) and T101A (frame 73) are in the pics too-so looks like the T101's with someone else. Dave Ellifrit

We watched a large but dispersed set of whales head west between Aleck Bay and Iceberg Point on
South Lopez
mid-day today. They were passing by from about

11:45 until

12:15
- there were probably more than a dozen, but I don't have a clear count as some were far from shore.

We are centered between the Eglon Boat launch and the point no point lighthouse. Could not get a good enough picture for you to send to verify which pod. thanks way exciting for me. Marion called at
