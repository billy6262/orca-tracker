Orca Sightings for May 18, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
A
Gray
was sighted feeding at
West Beach (Deception Pass State Park
), I observed it
feeding South to North
, from our concession building all the way to W. Point (right at the Pass.) I observed from
4- 5pm
. It was originally reported by a visitor as an injured whale "Not moving, bobbing in the water for over an hour". It was in shallow water - less than 100ft from shore rolling to feed-no apparent injuries or abnormal behavior. Anecdotal reports later said it has been in the area for several days.

Mary Hamann of Monroe called to report a
Gray whale
observed from
Deception Pass State Park
. They watched it between
1-3 pm
, as it fed in shallow water, rolling on its side, with pectoral fin and the tip of a fluke showing above the surface.

After I missed the J pod again, I still started listening at the
OrcaSound hydrophones
last night. It seemes succesfull, because arount 1 am (
4pm PST
) I heard them! First faint, then louder. Later at the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
as well, so they must been heading south. When they stopped at the Lime Kiln hydrophone (around
1:45 am,

4:45 pm
), I turned back at OrcaSound hydrophone, and was actually able to see them at the OrcaCam (heading north again)around 2 am (5pm)!

I got a call that
J-Pod
had slowly made it's way past
Kellett Bluff
(they were at False Bay early this morning, so they were definitely not in any sort of hurry! With only 2 boats within 10 miles of whales, it was very serene as the whales slowly meandered by. We saw
J17
and new calf
J44
, as well as
J30
Riptide doing very long dives. Even
J1
Ruffles was easy to spot in the flat calm water well over a mile away! Blows would carry so far across the water that many times we'd hear the blow and turn to look for the whale and only see a footprint on the water.

Hi, after telling a friend I spent some time with a
Gray whale
just off the beach on the east side of Marrowstone Isl. she passed this site along to me. I was kayaking south along the shore and noticed the spout. I observed the whale feeding in about 6 to 8 feet of water just north off Liplip point. I hung out for about 20 min. then proceeded around to the south west side of the island. On my return a couple hours later, The whale or, a gray whale surfaced 100 feet to my right and I paddled along with it until I reached east beach.
