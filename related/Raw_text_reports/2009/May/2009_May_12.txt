Orca Sightings for May 12, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb and Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J's and the K13's
(K13, K25, K27, K34, K20, and K38) spread out in tight groups off
Spieden Island
(48째 38.91 N, 123째 13.67 W) at

5:30 p.m.
The whales continued to travel north at a medium pace. The encounter ended off Stewart Island (48째 43.36 N, 123째 14.43 W) at
6:08 p.m. The whales were spread out across Haro Strait heading up Swanson Channel.

We left the dock at Snug at
11:00 AM since both Jeanne and Jeff Hogan had seen members of
J Pod
on the West Side of SJI. Alas, they headed into big seas south of Discovery Is. and no one could find them. We came back in at
1:30, and I proceeded to go to Hannah Hts. to look for them. Jeanne began to hear them, but I still couldn't see them. By around
3:30 or so, they appeared at Lime Kiln headed north. We got everyone back onto the boat and by

4:00
the leaders were almost to
Henry Is.
still going N. Ken Balcomb and David Ellifrit came out and took pictures. We left them at
5:30, with Ken and Dave still on scene, still headed N toward Turn Pt. I didn't see all the Js, but I think other boats did, including J1 and J2. There were some
Ks
with them still.

We last saw
J pod
traveling N in
Swanson Channel
Tuesday
evening
. Throughout their passage up Haro Strait they traveled at 5+ knots, so we were unable to observe them with our towed hydrophone array.

I was out with Jim Maya and his guests and while we didn't see whales (
J's & Ks
) in the a.m. we surely got to see them in the
afternoon
!

We on the Beam Reach research vessel have just seen multiple breaches about 2km offshore from
Lime Kiln
at ~

After I received message that orca's were heading west, I started listening to the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
- and waiting and patience paid off! Right now,

2:38 pm
- very faint calls but definetely southern residents! Then an update at
4:08 pm: About 1.5 hour ago I heard faint calls at the Lime Kiln hydrophone. Just now, since a few minutes, really clear calls at the OrcaSound hydrophone.

Around
4 pm
we heard some strange and faint whistles on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
- then ship noise drowned them out. Didn't sound like the usual
J pod
calls, but they were pretty faint and hard to detect.
