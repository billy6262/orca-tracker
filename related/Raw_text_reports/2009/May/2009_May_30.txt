Orca Sightings for May 30, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went by boat to Rat Island, located in South
Port Townsend Bay
at the entrance to Kilisut Harbor. At

8:00pm
we were picnicking on the North side of the island when a
gray whale
surfaced and blew approximately 10 meters off shore. It appeared to be between 7 and 10 meters in length and exhibited feeding behavior up and down the North side of the island for the hour we were there.

While at
Pacific Beach around 2PM
we spotted a
Grey whale
about 100 yards out from shore past the breakers. We saw the spout blow three times and the back of the whale surface once and the tail fins once.

Yucata Rapids
, in the Stuart Island BC area.

The
3.30pm
Prince of Whales, Ocean Magic, encountered
two Minke Whales
at
Hein Bank
, around
4.30pm
. They were foraging in large cycles. The collection of gulls and sea birds on the surface would indicate often where these whales were feeding.

We headed out this afternoon into the Strait of Juan De Fuca in search of
T40
, Cpt. Hook and eventually found him traveling a few miles East of William Head. The sea state was very confused this afternoon but T40 seemed to be taking the surf in his stride. As we observed T40 we noticed a number of directions changes. It was great to see the old guy again.

Orca Network received a call from a fishing boat four miles due west of
Port Orford OR
, about twenty (20) orcas heading Northwest at
2 PM
. At least one male and a baby were present. They came up to the boat, even rubbing it. Photos were taken and will be sent to Orca Network on Monday when they come in.
