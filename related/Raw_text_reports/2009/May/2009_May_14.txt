One of my friends is on her way to Victoria on the ferry out of Anacortes. She and her husband spotted
J-Pod
with the new baby off
Blakely Island
at

8:15 AM
today, northbound. She said the ferry slowed to a crawl and the whales were pretty close to the boat.

A

While we watched J pod for a while off
Hein Bank
, two
Minke Whales
popped up. They were busy feeding. Thought you might like to see a Minke whale pic for a change. What a great afternoon out there even if the wind was a bit chilly.
