Orca Sightings for May 21, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon we caught up with several members of
Jpod
including
J27
Blackberry,
J28
Polaris and the new calf
J44
, just south of
Lime Kiln Par
k. We followed about 12 members of Jpod that also included
J17
Princess Angeline,
J34
Doublestuff and
J38
Cooke, as they moved north along the west side of San Juan Island up to
Andrew's Bay
. The rest of Jpod could be seen in the distance near Stuart Island.

We left the
J trailers
headed N. at
Turn Pt. at
6:30 this evening
. The
K13s
headed south at Kellet at

4:15
. I would suspect we'll see both groups tomorrow. Could the Ks, having split w the Js, be headed south to meet the rest of the Ks?

Around

8:45 pm
, a group of about
8 orcas
were travelling eastward through Active Pass. They were moving quite quickly but we saw one spy hop. It is our first sighting of the season, although fellow whale watchers from Georgeson Bay tell me it is the third time they have seen them in the Pass this week.

Thought you might like this
Minke
pic for your data base as it has a divit in its skin. Perhaps it is a familiar Minke in these waters, just off the west marker I believe I heard the driver say,
Hein Bank
approx
1.30pm
. I was in a Zodiac heading toward San Juan Island to watch J Pod.

What a beautiful day watching
J pod and some of K pod
, head north along the shoreline of
San Juan Island
, between
2-3 pm
today. Got to see one of the little ones
J44
swimming close to mom
J17
. Not much foraging going on as they were really moving in rather spread out groups. I was on a POW Zodiac enjoying the calm conditions. We actually were surprised by a sudden appearance of a
Minke Whale
on the west side of
Hein Bank
during our trip over to the San Juans.

, south of San Juan Island, several miles from shore.
