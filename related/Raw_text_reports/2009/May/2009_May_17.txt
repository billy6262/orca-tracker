Orca Sightings for May 17, 2009
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had a few minke sightings. About
10 a.m.
briefly saw
two minke
spouts just off Partridge Pt. west side of Whidbey. Later, about
2 p.m
. saw a minke much closer, wandering among the fishing boats about 2 miles
southwest of Smith Island
. At one point the minke was about 30 feet off the back of our boat, then dove.

At
9am
we received confirmed report from Ron Bates, MMRG, that
J Pod
had been sighted near Sooke heading west. By the time we caught up with JPod at
12.45pm
, they were already traveling south in the Strait of Juan De Fuca a few miles from Sheringham Point (see above photo). We watched JPod in close formation surfing the waves in the strait. Later in the afternoon we heard that JPod had already reached Jordan River and were continueing west. Looks like they have headed out west but hopefully will be back soon.
