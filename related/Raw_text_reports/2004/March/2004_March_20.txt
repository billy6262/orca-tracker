Orca Sightings for March 20, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod west of Victoria. They were feeding, but when we left them they were headed west toward Race Rocks. Tons of Dall's Porpoise off of Lime Kiln in the afternoon.
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Charters
San Juan Island
*
After going through my photos I was able to confirm J1, J2, J11 with 39, J14, J17, J22 with 38, J26, J27, J28, and J32. I got the impression that the whole group was there judging by their numbers.
Cheers,
