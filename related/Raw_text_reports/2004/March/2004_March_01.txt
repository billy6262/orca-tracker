Orca Sightings for March 1, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted 3 or 4 transient orca westbound at the mouth of the Juan de Fuca Strait at
1415
. I was able to see one adult male fin and 2 or 3 other blows but hard to say for sure how many as they were probably 5 miles away. This would put them mid strait.
