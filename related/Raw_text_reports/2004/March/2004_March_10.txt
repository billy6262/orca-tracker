Orca Sightings for March 10, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Finally a report of J's. They were heading south between False Creek and Texada Island (near Departure Bay - between Vancouver & Nanaimo) at
1000
and spotted by the Coast Guard ship W.E. Ricker. I just looked at a few photos that they took and could positively ID J1 and J8.
