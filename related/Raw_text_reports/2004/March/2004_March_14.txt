Orca Sightings for March 14, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
So here is the run down on the NW Fisheries Science Center winter killer whale distribution cruise - on the way south we got kw vocalizations for about 6 hours off the Columbia R. - could not stay with them till daylight - these are still a mystery, but likely transients. More faint kw calls off Tillimook, OR. Got a bit beat up from there on south by the weather. On the north bound leg we saw 8 offshores in Monterey Bay, 7 transients west of Arcata, 3 transients west of Cape Falcon and 4 transients west of the Columbia - this was an interesting sighting of an attempted Pacific white-sided dolphin attack. Yes, L pod appeared for us on Sat (
March 13) off Westport - stayed with them about 10 hours until we lost them acoustically. Lots of foraging behavior observed. The frosting on the cake was the acoustic detection of J pod just north of Neah Bay on Sunday night on our way home. A very successful cruise - I am still in a bit of shock.
Thanks for all your help!

Entry 2:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters reported the 2 Gray whales feeding near Hat Island (near S. Whidbey Island) at
3 pm
today. They said one of them looked like "Patch", the resident gray whale with a large white patch on its back.

Mike just called with an update at
1:30 pm - the 2 gray whales are now between Camano Head & Tulalip Bay, slowly heading south.
*
Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called in at

11:20 am
to report 2 gray whales (likely the same two as yesterday) just east of Camano Head (S. Camano Island/Saratoga Passage). Cascadia Research staff are again onboard, so hopefully we'll get some ID's to see if these are some of the returning "Resident" Grays we see each year.
