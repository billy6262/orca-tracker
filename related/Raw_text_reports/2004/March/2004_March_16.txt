Orca Sightings for March 16, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
This morning at about

9:30 or
10:00
I got a call from my waterfront neighbor that she had seen a grey whale close to shore. We live at the top of first Street in Langley. I ran down there and we saw it again 3 times as it made its way across to the other side of the passage near Camano Island.
