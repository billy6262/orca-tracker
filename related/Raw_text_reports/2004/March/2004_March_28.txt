Orca Sightings for March 28, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Two gray whales (?) on the Camano Island side of Port Susan, about

2:00 pm
. They were heading south out of the bay. Saw one large tail fluke and two spouts. It took about 5-10 minutes for them to move out of sight without binoculars.

just west of Langley. There were two whales, one large, one small feeding for a while in the sand beds moving toward toward Sandy Point.

7:40a.m
, we also spotted the two whales in Saratoga Passage in Langley... Very nice spouts and flukes. Today they were making their way with more haste than in past days, so you had to be quick to see them.

10:40 AM
- At least two Grays spotted near the mainland just south of the Mukilteo ferry dock heading south. Too far out to tell if it were the mom and calf.

We were fortunate to have the window open this morning and awoke to the glorious sound of spouting! Two whales- appeared to be a mom and baby- about 100 yards offshore from our deck (in Langley just west of the Inn at Langley). Even saw a bit more of a tail fluke than usual.
