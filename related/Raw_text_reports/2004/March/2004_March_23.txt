Orca Sightings for March 23, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I spotted a Gray in the distance from the ferry at

5:15 p.m
. The whale was traveling north up Possession Sound (between Whidbey/Mukilteo) in the main channel, but closer to Mukilteo. First noticed his tail fluke, and then after a few minutes we were able to see it surface and blow a few times.

I picked up T14 near Henry Island today at
1145
. It looked as though he was stalking a seal. He eventually gave up on that one and continued north towards Speiden. I passed him off to Dave Ellifrit on Orca who stayed with him until at least
1600
as I met up with him and T14 near Waldron Island at 1430. The last report I got that he was in the middle of Boundary Pass and headed south-west towards Turn Pt at
1600
.

I left T14 at
1740
heading South past Gooch Island. I think he killed at least one seal on the backside of Spieden Island around
1300
.
