Orca Sightings for February 19, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi, Orcas going North in Swanson Channel, off North Pender Island, Mouat Point at
1650

February 19th. One group of 3 with a male, a separate group of 5 and another group further out in the channel of 9 -11. They were just in the rays of the sunset so it was hard to count. First of the season for me and a wonderfully reassuring sight.

Nancy Black, orca researcher in Monterey, reports a pod of 7 Offshores in Monterey Bay. She was able to photograph & confirm them as Offshores, and they were observed eating salmon later in the day.
