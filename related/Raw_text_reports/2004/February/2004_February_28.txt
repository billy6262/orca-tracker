Finally some orca! With help from a couple of shore based whale-watchers on the Victoria waterfront (Ron Bates and Rhonda Reidy) we found the T41's and T61 Saturday afternoon(Feb 28). I left T61 a couple of miles east of Race Rocks westbound @
1530
and the T41's (T41, 41a, and T44 @ 1630 as they were approaching Trial Island on an easterly heading.
