Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called a little after
1 pm
today to report
orcas
off Kingston, heading south. So far he has identified members of J pod, but there are more whales toward the Edmonds side & possibly more coming from up north, so it's likely K's are with them as well. Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research is out with them & we will have ID's later. Still foggy around Whidbey, so we hope you folks further south can see them out there!
