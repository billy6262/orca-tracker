We observed what appeared to be a group of about 20 dolphins or
porpoises
off of Fort Casey and the Keystone Ferry area this afternoon (11/15) about 1pm. They were dark grey or black in color and we saw only very low profile dorsal fins as they surfaced and dove. Mostly stayed in the same area and may have been feeding. Individual groups ranged in number from 3-7. Tried to get pictures, will see how they turn out.

We saw a pod of about 10
orcas
in Active Pass about

1:30pm
off the B.C. Ferrie. There didn't appear to be any large males and I couldn"t identify them but they were very active, tail slapping and breaching. They were heading out of Active pass and into the Georgia Straits with a small whale watching boat travelling with them..
