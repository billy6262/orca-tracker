It's
1 pm
and we're looking at fins a way off Columbia Beach (S. Whidbey Island, so of the Clinton ferry) heading south. I could see three or four for sure, maybe more.

Yippee Skippee and Happy Thanksgiving!! We just saw the
orcas
--probably about 5 being led by a male but in two little groups. They were heading south from the Mukilteo Ferry just rolling along. We watched them between Smuggler's Cove and Chennault Beach at about

1:35 PM
. They were about halfway out in the water between Mukilteo and Whidbey but a little closer to the mainland side. Yes!!

11:30 am
