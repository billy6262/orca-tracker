Orca Sightings for November 19, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale tales called in the following reports on
K pod
this afternoon:
4 pm
- spread out and milling between Bainbridge Island and Alki Pt, heading south.
5 pm
- heading south down the east side of Vashon, between the Vashon & Southworth ferry docks.

3:40 p.m.
Well, I finally got a bead on the
orcas
from one of these reports. They are tight against the Bainbridge shore approaching Restoration Point as I write this. I am at Alki Beach,

They're continuing south, soon to pass between Manchester and Blake Island. It's a good bet they will head down Colvos Passage.

3:50 p.m
. The whales spread out and milled awhile at the head of Vashon, or at the area where Rich Pass, Alki Point, Blake and Vashon more or less converge, making kind of a basin - probably a convergent zone for fish. Little Springer did pretty well in the area! Sunset was upon us as the K's stopped to mill for a few minutes, and the sweep of the water was alive with sunlit orca blows, like a beautiful field of pale yellow flowers.

K pod
spotted off of Restoration Point at

4:00pm
. They were pretty far off so I could not tell what direction they were headed.

For the first time I finally saw the
orcas
from the ferry! At

11:55a.m.
today J pod was putting on a great display, just several hundred yards into Rosario Strait where Thatcher Pass intersects the strait. Most of the whales seemed to be torn between either exuberant socializing or foraging, so they seemed to opt for both, except for J1 Ruffles. He was exuberantly foraging, doing his trademark deep angled dives, often turning in mid-dive. The sprouters also seemed to be more interested in energetic foraging than playing. While often I see the calves and juveniles being the most active, today it was the adults. They were engaged in lively socializing with lots of rubbing together, active tail slapping, tail throwing, head lunging, and spyhopping and falling over backwards. They were making some serious white water. Probably the youngsters were also involved, but I just couldn't see them for all the water the adults were putting up. Great day!
