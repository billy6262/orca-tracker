============================================================

Entry 1:
Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called in to report
K pod
between Bainbridge & Vashon Islands at

1:10 pm
, still heading south, porpoising at high speed.

Based on your note today identifying the presence of
Orcas
south of Bainbridge, I sighted them at the north end of Colvos Passage, between the Southworth and Vashon ferry landings, playfully heading south. I live in Manchester, and they were too far away to identify. Time of sighting =

13:35
.

K's
were headed down Colvos Passage - he had them off the north end of Vashon Island at about 2 pm, closer to the Kitsap Peninsula side & still heading south at a fast speed.

K pod
just passed down Colvos passage (W. side of Vashon), should be nearly to the lattitude of Gig Harbor as I write.

today to report they were with
K pod
at the south end of Bainbridge Island, heading south. They had found them at Shilshole, & it looked like they may have been heading west toward the inside of Blake Island when they left them due to rough sees.
