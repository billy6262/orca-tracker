What a fabulous afternoon of whale watching from our bluff in southwest Seattle approximately 1.5 miles south of the Fauntleroy ferry dock. We first spotted them around

12:30pm
off the east side of Vashon Island where they were porpoising and traveling south. During the course of afternoon, we observed lobttailing, spyhopping, and even a few breachings. One whale with a huge dorsal fin stayed solo off to the west of the large group that seemed to be traveling in a fairly tight formation. They headed south for approximately one hour, then abruptly turned and headed north at a faster speed than when they were southbound. Maybe due to the boat activity? We had them in sight for almost 2 hours which was simply thrilling to observe!
