Orca Sightings for August 23, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we rounded Eagle Point (west side of San Juan Is.), the whales could be seen near Lime Kiln Lighthouse porpoising actively down the west side, making our trip a few minutes shorter by coming towards us. As we lay quiet in the very still water with hydrophone down, we could hear a few distant vocalizations. As the whales neared and continued porpoising by the boat, the vocalizations got quite loud, with distinct
J, K, and L pod calls
. Soon the hydrophone was picking up a literal symphony of calls. The whales had been spread out as they went by, with a few whales actually diverting course and coming over to the boats. As we floated near False Bay, we observed a lot of breaching and the vocalizations continued. As we were preparing to depart for the day, L-74 (Saanich) led a few whales by the boat and released some of the most varied bursts of echolocations and vocalizations I've heard all year. The whales appeared to be heading out towards the Salmon Bank marker when we left for the day.
