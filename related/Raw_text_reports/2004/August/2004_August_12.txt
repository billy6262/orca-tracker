Orca Sightings for August 12, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J,K & L pod
were travelling slowly Westbound in Boundary Pass in the late afternoon, very spread out. J's and L's had headed for Turn Point already, while the K's were lagging way behind along the shoreline of South Pender Island. The tide must have started to turn while we were there, because the K's all suddenly became much more interested in foraging in the tide rips than in continuing their journey. We observed one of the moms apparently teaching her calf how to lunge at a fish (possibly Lea & K36, but no definite ID).

The whales spent the night at the Fraser River, so it was good that they came down in time for our afternoon trip. As we set up south of Saturna Island, the whales came from Eastpoint, and really began to spread out. Lots of breaches as they got midway down Boundary, and the vocalizations were incredible! Ruffles, that incredible guy managed no less than two full breaches! As we were preparing to leave,
J-Pod
gave a surprise visit right in front of the boat. Blackberry even came up on his side, giving us a look and a very languid pectoral slap. Awesome!
