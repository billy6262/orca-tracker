Orca Sightings for August 21, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had
J & L pod
up North again today. Apparently K pod was also here in the AM, but they continued southbound from Point Roberts. Meanwhile, J's & L's turned and headed North. We left them at about

4:30
, still headed North towards Bowen Island. Lots of socializing, great vocals. Saw one youngster (1-2 yr old) doing amazing high breaches for its small size - it was getting a little help from Mom and a sibling!

We headed up President's Channel just as the
L's
made a westward turn towards Patos Island. They split the island and rejoined together on the west side of Patos. The fog whisps added a "mysterious" air to the day as L-57 led part of the pack near the boat. Later, the whales decided to do a different play from the playbook by going from President's Channel to Speiden Channel and down the west side of San Juan Island.
