Orca Sightings for August 1, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
After 2 days wandering the Straits of Juan de Fuca,
all 3 pods
returned to the islands (San Juans). Very interesting day as we found a small group of L's near False Bay. All the whales then turned again and were heading south towards Cattle Point behind us as we made our way home. As we rounded Cattle Point, we got surprise #3 when we discovered the L-12's actively fishing in the huge flood tide near Goose Island.
