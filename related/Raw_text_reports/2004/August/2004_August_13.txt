Orca Sightings for August 13, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the
afternoon
trip,
J, K & part of L pod
was headed north in Swanson Channel, very spread out. As the whales approached Active pass, they funnelled together, as they usually do. Just before going into Active pass, the leaders of the group travelling along the shore of Mayne Island stopped. First the leader turned to face south, then the next 2 whales did the same thing. The 3 were lined up side by side along the rocky shore line, logging at the surface, just as though they were preparing for a meeting ceremony. They stayed there for a minute or two, just until the pod(s) caught up, then they turned, and the whole group started porpoising towards Active Pass all together. We were too far away for ID's on those leaders, especially with the sun also glistening off the the water, but it was a very special sighting for us & for our passengers.

Our
black and white friends
started the day out near Hein Bank, slowly moving up the west side of San Juan. They did the old North/South turnaround a few times before slowly heading towards Turn Point. By the time we got up North, the whales were instead going up from Turn Point towards Swanson channel. Whales spread out over a mile apart, which meant keeping the old head on a swivel as whales came together in groups, only to break up and go their own ways. Some good vocalizations and one other boat had a great story I'm sure they'll email in on a very unusual occurance. Cappuccino (K21) gave us a really good viewing as he foraged in a nearby current. Lots of eagles and seals (one seal "breached" no less than 4 times near the shore) on the way home. Whales were still heading back to the Fraser (hopefully to eat a lot of coho).
