Orca Sightings for August 9, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
6 pm
we were crabbing in Westsound and saw 2
animals
breeching between Victim Island and Double Island. I would guess they were about 10'-12' and came out of the water about 6' or so, hung there and came down on their stomachs. One of them did this in 2 sets of 3-4 breeches and the other breeched twice. They were grey with the underside a little lighter. Could they have been young Minke whales or something else? We didn't see any decernable blows and no sign of a mother whale around - It was pretty amazing to see in Westsound.

passed North Pender Island this afternoon between
4 p.m. and 5 p.m
. The whales were really spread out wide and long. It took an hour for all of them to pass by.

We had
all three pods
at Hannah Heights, slowly moving up San Juan Island. The whales were spread out over an area close to a mile wide and the distance between leaders and stragglers was probably close to a mile as well.
