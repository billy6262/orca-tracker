Orca Sightings for August 14, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
All 3 pods
..including the famous ruffles. Our host said most all of the whales of the 3 pods were accounted for. They breached, spy hopped and splashed..all my dreams came true in one amazing afternoon.

We were on the 5.15 am ferry out of Tsawwassen to Duke Point and lo and behold, just 15 min out of the terminal, in the rising sun, we saw a pod of
orcas
. Now they were really spread out, but assuming, having seen only one large male, it was Jpod.

We followed and found the
orcas
spread all over between Cypress and Blakely. They were fishing the tide, heading slowly south. Soundwatch visited us and told us everyone was there except the L12s. Lots of breaching! We left them about

4:30
near the south end of Blakely. What a treat!!

We were with
L-25's
on the west side of San Juan Island, a little north of Salmon Bank
at dinner time
. The
orcas
were very spread out, foraging along with the gill-netters and purse seiners. As they approached a boat just setting his gill net, they grouped up tight and appeared to go under the net together...maybe making sure the younger ones knew what to do. The L-12s were very seriously hunting down the bank. L-41 made some very sharp rolls at the surface as he was zooming after his dinner. There must have been some salmon hiding under our keel as he made three passes around us.
Captain Skip found a Minke whale on the trip back to Skyline to end an interesting and enjoyable trip aboard the Koinonia.

Decisions decisions....most of the Southern Residents were up to the north and the
L12's
were hanging out near Cattle Point, so we decided to go for the short run today. As the afternoon progressed, the whales began to slowly move from Cattle Point towards Eagle Point.

On
morning
trip,
J, K & most of L pod
were found just south of Alden Bank, east of Sucia Island. They were very spread out, travelling slowly southbound. We left them just east of Matia Island at about
1145
am. On the
afternoon
trip, we caught up to the same whales just at the north end of Blakely Island at about

4:15 pm
. They must have had a little afternoon rest somewhere - they certainly didn't travel their usual distance for 4.5 hrs. Just when we arrived on scene, we observed what appeared to be a meeting ceremony going on, which was a little surprising as we thought these whales had spent the entire past day together. Apparently, the ceremony was between the L's that had travelled North and those that had stayed down South. Our boat observed this from quite a great distance (perhaps someone else saw it a little closer for a better story), but it was still a very special sighting for crew & passengers alike.
