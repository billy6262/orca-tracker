Orca Sightings for August 31, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted a small group of
transients
(4 individuals) just west of Active Pass, near Enterprise Reef, at about

10:00
. This was probably the same group sighted by Peter Reiner at
0940
in Trincomali Channel. We observed them making one pass through the kelp bed at Enterprise Reef, then grouping together for what appeared to be resting behavior. This group was seen a short time later by another whale watching boat as they meandered Eastbound through Active Pass. I was hoping that someone with more experience observing transients might be able to help me ID the group. It appeared to be a family group led by a female with a dorsal fin that was very wide at the base, and very triangular (similar to T69's). I didn't get a close enough look at the fin to note if there was damage on it. With this female was what appeared to be a sprouting male.

We received a call from Elana Slater reporting a pod of 5 - 6
orcas
in Penn Cove off Whidbey Island this morning at

7:15 am
. She said they were near the Coupeville Wharf, heading out of the cove toward N. Camano Island.

I live on possession sound, whidbey island side--about a mile from possession point. I was walking north yesterday and heard a loud snort, looking out I saw an upright black fin and a spout of water. I can say pretty definately they were not porposies because of the fin, but i am not 100% thay they were orcas because form the angle I was at I could not see white spots and because I couldnt believe I was seeing this far south this time of year. I watched for a while and I saw two fins-- they appeared to be staying close to the surface because I only saw one tail once.
They surfaced 6-8 times, Because the fin was long I am pretty sure they were orcas. It was around
noon
and I assume they were feeding, because they were close in to shore and the tide was low. I was walking farther out than the average tide and they appeared to be just 3-4 hundred feet off shore. Once they left what we refer to as the cove (an area north of my cabin that has five cabins -- the beach also angles out towards the sound and the next landmark is glendale pier) they appeared to dive deeper and did not resurface in my view.

As we got a bit closer, it looked like a possible greeting ceremony, but instead it was
J's & K's
in a long line in a resting pattern. Later in the afternoon from shore, we observed the whales slowly moving north towards Lime Kiln. But they didn't make it much past there as they never appeared near the county park.

We have our own whale report today - we watched what looked like all or most of the
Southern Residents
traveling north & south at the same time, from Land Bank on the west side of San Juan Island at around
3 pm
.
*
We heard from Kristen Burgess who is also up on San Juan Island this week, that this morning at
4 am
she woke up to the sound of
orcas
breathing, & watched them in the moonlight from where she they were staying on Hannah Heights.

A group of 4
transients
passed by the southern entrance to Active Pass this morning at
0940
. They were travelling west up Trincomali Channel, about 300m away from Helen Point on Mayne Island and then about the same distance from Collinson Point on Galiano. There was a bit of spyhopping, but mostly they were on the move. They paid no attention to the resident harbour seal rookery in Georgeson Bay, even though the tide was low and there were about 40 seals lolling about on the exposed surface of nearby Collinson Reef. Despite the proxmity of the Orcas, the seals appeared untroubled as well.

Tom Perry of Camano Island called at

5:55 pm
to report one large male
orca
(likely a transient) heading north up Saratoga Passage, 1/2 mile north of Onamac Pt. mid-passage.
