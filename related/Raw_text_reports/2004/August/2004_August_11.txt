Orca Sightings for August 11, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Wednesday morning I picked up the
T18's
between Albert Head and William Head. They were leaping around and vocalizing at the surface. I had some incredible vocalizing coming up through the hull of the boat. They were acting very proud. From the descriptions that I got from the day before it sounds like they were the 4 T's with T14 yesterday. It was interesting that the whole time the T18's were vocalizing, J Clan without the L 12's were 2 or 3 miles resting. We left the T18's west bound at Bechey Head at
1330
.
Cheers,

We were fishing off of Beechey Head and around

1:45pm
we were surprised by
a large dorsal fin
about 100 yards off our boat and then we saw 3 more. We managed to get ahead of them and wait for them to resurface. They went down for a long dive because it was about 5 minutes later before they surfaced off in the distance. We were with them for about 45 minutes. We last saw the four of them on the south side of Secretary Island heading north in the strait. It was an amazing afternoon. I have a picture of a saddle patch.

Transients
were spotted west of Race Rocks. Too far for Soundwatch, especially with M3 on the water. So at
11:45 we gave up and headed home. Then a call at

2:00
---the residents made a turn at Race and were heading back to San Juan. As we left Snug Harbor, we spied many whales heading North. We set up as usual on the outside of the boats so we could monitor boats, and had
J-1
Ruffles swimming by himself on the outside of the group. As the whales headed North past the Turn Point lighthouse, one Orca gave the perfect spyhop, as if saying "yep, we're right next to the lighthouse gang!"
