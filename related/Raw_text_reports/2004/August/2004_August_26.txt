Orca Sightings for August 26, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
A whale was reported at the mouth of Sinclair Inlet, swimming close enough to shore for her to see the blow and part of a whale fluke when it sounded.
Don't know what kind of whale
, but those of you in the Kitsap Peninsula/Bremerton/Port Orchard/Bainbrige Island area should keep your binoculars handy, & let us know if you see anything out there in the fog!
*
There was a major attack on seals by the
T18's and T20's
this afternoon just north of Mandarte Is. Mark Malleson called at
2037
to report a second major attack in Oak Bay off Great Chain Is.(Victoria area). 2+ seals at least, gulls going wild.
