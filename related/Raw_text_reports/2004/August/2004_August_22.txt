Orca Sightings for August 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we came down the west side of San Juan Island, the
whales (orcas)
obligingly came up from Lime Kiln towards Open Bay. The whales were pretty spread out with some right on shore while others preferred to travel up to 1/2 mile or more off shore. Not much in the way of vocalizations until they were right up next to the boats, then they would vocalize briefly before becoming silent. Today's "thing I've never seen before" behavior---one whale was near a private boat and came up to the surface upside-down and tailslapped about 30 times in a staccato manner. Shortly after that, a large male that appeared from a distance to be L78 surfaced nearby.
