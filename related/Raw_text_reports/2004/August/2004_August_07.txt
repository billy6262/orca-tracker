Between

12:30 p.m. and
2:00 p.m
, the best superpod of the year that I've caught off Landbank, south of Lime Kiln Park. Very close in. Much rolling, tail slapping, spyhopping, breaching, everything. Lots of surface vocalizations.
L12
came very close in and spyhopped for my camera about 5 times.
J1
came by tail slapping somewhat in unison with one of the younger calves. Then many of the big males decided to roll around together off Deadman Bay. Lots of great activity. By the time they went by County Park, many were resting.

Orcas!
Yeah! After 4 days out in the Straits and beyond,
all 3 pods
of whales arrived back safe and sound off the West side of San Juan Island. They headed towards False Bay as they crossed the straits, and turned south towards Cattle Point. As we were leaving the dock, we heard they were heading north and sure enough we found them just North of Lime Kiln.

The
Orcas
were back and the west side was a long line of zod's and all the other commercial boats, all very well behaved I might add.
