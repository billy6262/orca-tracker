Orca Sightings for August 29, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Always nice to have the
orcas
return after some foraging in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. As all 3 pods of residents approached San Juan Island on the huge flood tide, they decided to do the old west-side split, with the L-12's going from Lime Kiln towards Cattle Point, and the rest of the residents heading north. Very nice to see L-12 (Alexis) and L-78 (Gaia) as they foraged in the strong currents near False Bay. Some very loud vocalizations, and a loud bump on the hydrophone as L-78 went under the boat (a dorsal hitting the mic perhaps?)
