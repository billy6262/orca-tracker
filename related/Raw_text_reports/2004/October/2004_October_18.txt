Orca Sightings for October 18, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
All three pods
, except maybe the L12's, came south past Lime Kiln and down the middle of Haro around

2:30 p.m.
I believe I saw the new calves as they passed Hannah Heights. The whales then foraged for several hours off Pile Point. I lost sight of them heading for Hein Bank at around

5:30 p.m.
Lots of breaching and cartwheeling as they headed for Hein.
