Orca Sightings for October 16, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed out to Constance Bank off of Victoria to observe
Humpback
whales on Saturday. We observed two whales that appeared to be 35+ feet in length. Some of our guests were fairly certain there were at least two other animals but I cannot confirm this.
