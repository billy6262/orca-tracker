3-4 pm
, we spotted 10+
Orcas
, including at least one calf.

We headed north along the E. side of Bainbridge Is. First we saw two which appeared to be traveling north but after circling we presumed they were foraging as sometimes they were going in circles. Then we saw several more coming from the south and some further north. We actually enjoyed watching approx 18 - 20
orcas
apparently looking for an afternoon snack....right at "tea time"
3.30pm to 4.15pm
! A few more orcas were just north but fairly close to the Kitsap shoreline. There were several pairs which appeared to be working together with lunging and quick changes of directions. As we tried to position the plane with the late afternoon sun we saw at least two large dorsal fins of males who breached several times also.

We first spotted them northwest of our location (Scatchet Head) at
5 PM
as they headed out of Useless Bay toward Point no Point. They were VERY far out, so it was difficult to see any details as to dorsal fins, or even to count them, but they seemed very frisky, judging from the amount of splashing we saw out there.

As we were about 5 minutes out from Kingston on the Edmonds/Kingston route around
6 PM
the Captain announced "
Orcas
off the Bow". We didn't see anything from the car deck but he apparently was able to spot them from his lofty view.

Just wanted to let someone know that there were approx. 6 maybe more
Orcas
just east of Kingston,(approx. 1-2 miles). We saw 2 jump as they were headed south. They then appeared to swim in a large circle and back and forth in a north south direction for about 1/2 hr. After this they slowly started to move south. We had stopped to let them pass but they decided to stop. It was spectacular. There was a very large one with a tall dorsel, the rest appeared to be smaller.

9:47pm
tonight heard 3 loud voluminous blows in Colvos Passage headed towards Gig Harbor. Not sure what it was. Maybe some folks down south should keep there eyes peeled. Too big to be a sea-lion. Maybe a humpback has returned. Maybe a minke?

We were having a walk on the beach at Jordan River (S. Vancouver Island) Saturday evening at about

5:30
when we saw what appeared to be a solitary
gray whale
headed west, approximately 100-200 yards offshore.
