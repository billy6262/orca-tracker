Orca Sightings for October 7, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas
to the North. Orcas to the South. As we came out of Speiden Channel we saw fins spread out over a mile across, with J's & L's to our North and K's to our South. As we floated near Henry Island, we saw scattered members of L-Pod approach and pass. Then the excitement began as whales began to approach from the South (K-Pod?). We watched as the whales foraged near Open Bay. A large, empty tanker passed by and a lone Orca very near the tanker breached as it passed. A nice pass by L-79 Skana made my day.

K pod
spent all day off the south and west sides of San Juan Island, spending lots of time foraging. At around

3:00 p.m
. they headed north. After they passed County Park, they headed offshore and met up with lots of L pod. I don't know if it was all of L pod, but many of the adult and sprouter males were there, including L41 and L57. After meeting up, the whales headed slowly south. L57 did a huge breach inshore at Land Bank on his way south. After foraging offshore of Hannah Heights, the whales continued southeast out of sight at around
7:00 p.m.
