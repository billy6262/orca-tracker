Orca Sightings for October 19, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just saw on King 5 news at noon around

12:45pm
that
L-pod
is off Possession Point! They showed some great "live" aerial shots of them frolicking in the water. That means though that they are not too far from the oil spill though. argh.

are off Whidbey Island, but I don't have a direction of travel (the newscopter didn't indicate) Great news for L-Pod!
