Orca Sightings for October 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
...we got a call saying
Residents
were coming down from the North heading towards Lime Kiln. All 3 pods were out and about--spread out over quite the distance. They were actively feeding and breaching and popping out of the waves! One whale even "surfed" underwater as a wave carried him along.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported
L pod
heading south in Haro Strait at about
2 pm
this afternoon. They saw L104, but due to the windy weather & waves, weren't able to ID who all was there.
