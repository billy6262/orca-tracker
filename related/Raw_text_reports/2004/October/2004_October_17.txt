Orca Sightings for October 17, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave and Marine responded to a report of five whales heading North in Swanson Channel and they found
JKL pods
(minus L12s) going through Active Pass. L43s calf (L104) was still with mum, and L27 had a new calf which we call L105. We hope it makes it!
