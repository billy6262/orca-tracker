Orca Sightings for December 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
From our house at Olalla, about 1/2 mile north of Olalla Bay, we saw a pod of
Orcas
swim through Colvos passage, northbound about

1:30 p.m.
. We could see as many as a dozen at a time, so presume more were present. Neighbors told us they swam through the Passage southbound that morning about
9:30.

4 p
m at Three Tree Pt, still heading north.

I spotted 2
T's
off of Becher Bay heading west this afternoon while hiking. Perhaps they were T20 and 21?

Around

9:15 am
or so a huge number of
orcas
passed Lisabeula park on Vashon headed south. I've seen several pods pass this way over the last few years, but this time it must be both J and K pods we saw passing in succession. A stunning procession of whales.
