Orca Sightings for December 27, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at

1:10
to say they saw
orcas
off Blake Island, near Winslow. He called at

1:20
to report they were south of Restoration Pt, toward Blake Island, & they saw K20 and her new calf. At

2:36
he said the whales were just south of the Vashon ferry, 1/2 mile off shore, heading south. They had seen only K pod whales today.

Amy Carey was with
K pod
much of today along the shorelines of Vashon Island. At

2:25 pm
she reported K pod in the ferry lanes, closer to the Vashon side, looking like they were going to head down the east side of Vashon Island. At

3:10 pm
she reported them heading south, just past Dilworth. At

4:15 pm
they were rounding Robinson point, spread out & still heading south in the sunset. Last sighting for today at

5:00pm
. After joyfully watching the whales pass Point Robinson ( Mount Rainier in full glory with a blazing red sun to the West...wow) and head South along the shore of Maury island we were lucky enough to see them traveling North again an hour or so after the first pass.

I just saw
orcas
from

9:40 to
9:50
. We saw three swimming south very close to the mainland off Smugglers Cove, Olympic Terrace Sewer Plant--Mukilteo. I was a little confused as to sex. One had a fairly good sized dorsal fin. They swam south, appeared to be feeding with some rolling and spouting off Chennault Beach north of the shipwreck.

whales
(~30) in Possession Sound, near the mainland side.
