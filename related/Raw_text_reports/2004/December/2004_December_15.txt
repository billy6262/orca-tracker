Orca Sightings for December 15, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We heard
offshores
this evening starting around

5:50pm until 7pm
. They were in Johnstone Strait and we believe they headed east past Robson Bight. This might have been the same whales seen by Alex Morton & Bill MacKay yesterday not far from Alert Bay.
