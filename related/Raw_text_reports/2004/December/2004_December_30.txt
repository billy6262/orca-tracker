Orca Sightings for December 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Saw two
Orcas
in Saratoga Passage between East Point and Langley, off Whidbey Island. They were swimming North. One was larger than the other. The sighting was at

10:30 a.m.
. We were rowing and were probably 200 yards away. Too far away to see any markings. Hadn't seen whales before but just moved here in October.

At about
10;00 AM
we watched 6
Orcas
off Brownsville Marina (west side of Bainbridge Is.) for about an hour from my boat. There were two large bulls, two females, two young adults. After watching for about two hours, with the bulls off to one side, with three or four whales on the surface, there was a bright red bubble of blood about five feet across. There was too much blood for anything but a possible birth or a seal kill. Since they had been there for two hours, there couldn't have been any seals in the area. We then saw a very small whale with small fin and tail that was a foot and half across. Is it possible that this was indeed the birth of a whale?

We saw a pod of about 8
orcas
at

4:30PM
. We are on Rich passage by Illahee state park. There appeared to be 2 babies and 5 adults. The whales were initially travelling North but then turned around by the park and went South. They appeared to be feeding.

I had one last sighting of the
orcas
in Saratoga Passage before I had to head north today. At

1:20 pm
just off North Bluff, north of Greenbank I saw 2 females with a calf, close in to the Whidbey side, & 1 with a larger fin but not as big as J1 coming out of the entrance to Holmes Harbor heading toward Camano & the small group of orcas. I saw them each a time or two, then they all disappeared.

Carolyn Mercer called at

12:40 pm
to report a male
orca
breaching off North Bluff, Greenbank, & another group of 3 including a calf, heading south toward Holmes Harbor.

One
orca
slowly moving northwest ~

1:30 pm
about 1 mile out from Ebey's Landing. Medium size male-ish dorsal. I've never seen just one orca and visibility was excellent with no other orcas sighted during a 20 minute period.

Just observed the whole mess of
Orcas
heading from Holmes Harbor back to Langley,

2:15 pm
. Hard to count, as they were spread out. Willing to say 12-16. What a site out front on Bells Beach. Got pics but still need to download them....

Tom McMillen reported the orcas at

2:50 pm
between Langley & East Pt, heading south. Candi Emmons of the Center for Whale Research was with him, they had so far only ID'd K pod whales. At

3:30 pm
the whales were off Langley, heading south-east. They reported seeing K20 with her new calf.

The same group of
Orcas
were off Langley again at

3:05 p.m
, heading toward Hat Island.

Sharon Heath of Langley called to report
orcas
passing downtown Langley at

3:15 pm
, heading S. East, moving pretty fast.
*

4:40 pm
- 6 to 8
Orcas
off of Sandy Point very close to the beach on the Whidbey Island side of the pass. All spread out and milling around the point, there was 1 very large Orca and what appeared to be a small calf. They were being followed by 2 boats. They moved around the point towards Everett around

4:50 pm
.

I got down to Langley just in time to see the
orcas
at

10:15 am
, heading north up Saratoga Passage. The group I saw from Langley was WAY on the Camano side, but there appeared to be at least one very large fin that could have been J1, but too far away to tell for sure. I followed them north, & just a mile or so north of Langley found a group of whales very close to the Whidbey side, still heading north at about

10:45 am
. I followed them north - they passed Bell's Beach at
11 am
, and at

11:30 am
I watched them pass East Point. They were very spread out, making it difficult to count or videotape them, but hopefully I was able to get one or two ID shots to be able to confirm who they are! At

11:45 am
they were heading toward North Bluff, & at noon I saw more between Camano Island & North Bluff, still heading north.
