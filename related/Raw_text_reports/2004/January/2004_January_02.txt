Orca Sightings for January 2, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:00pm Mukilteo ferry... we drove right to the front of the ferry and looked out at the water as the boat filled. Suddenly the waves splashed and a dorsel fin appeared. Im not sure who they were or how many but they were right off the front of the boat heading south.

We heard back from Tom McMillen at about
3 pm
, and
K pod
had already turned and headed back SE - they were still in the Posession Pt area off SW Whidbey Island, heading back toward Posession Sound or possibly back down toward Edmonds.

Good news today! Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters just called - he's out with Candice Emmons of the Center for Whale Research today, and they spotted K pod off South Whidbey - 1st headed south from Posession Sound toward Edmonds, but then they turned and headed north up the west side of Whidbey Island. At

2:20 pm
they were
just north of Posession Pt, heading north
.
The great news is that
K12 has a new calf!!
Researchers thought a new calf was present with the pod when they were sighted earlier this week near Vashon Island, but Candi was able to positively ID the new calf with K12 today. This news is good, but also a little scary, as we know K pod has traveled through the area of the recent fuel spill at least several times, beginning Dec. 31st, the day after the spill.
Orcas can be harmed by swimming through oil or fuel slicks when they surface to breathe and ingest the fumes off the surface of the water. This is especially critical for newborns, as they are just learning how to breathe and are smaller so need to surface for air more often.
