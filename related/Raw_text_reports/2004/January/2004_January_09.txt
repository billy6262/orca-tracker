Orca Sightings for January 9, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
A pod of about 10 was going southbound from the Clinton ferry (Possesion Sound) on the Whidbey side about

10:30 AM
.
*
Steve Jeffries called again at

3:30 pm
to say the Tacoma News Tribune received another call, with a pod of 15 - 20 orcas off the Point Defiance Ferry dock; this is a separate group from the pod of 8 that was just reported off Steilacoom traveling south.
*
Received another report from Steve Jeffries of F&W - the pod of orcas are still heading south, and at
1 pm
were between
Steilacoom and McNeil Island
(so. Puget Sound), with 8 orcas observed.

But we received a call from Steve Jeffries of Wash. Fish & Wildlife, and they had received a call from the Tacoma News Tribune that a pod of orcas were reportedly off Point Defiance this morning (~
10 or 11 am
), which means there are at least two pods of orcas in Puget Sound today, which may help explain our mystery of trying to figure out if yesterday's whales in Saratoga Passage were K pod or Transients.

We just received a call from Sharon Heath in Langley, SE Whidbey Island, reporting 4 or 5 orcas in
Saratoga Passage
, off Langley (see below). Most likely the same pod we saw heading north in the passage yesterday. If anyone can get any photos of this pod please let me know! Yesterday I thought it was likely K pod due to the number of whales and calves, & the presence of a very young calf...but, then last night we got the report below from our stranding network, which makes it look like Transient orcas were in the area - also following is another report on this morning's orcas -

8:15
- A pod of Orcas just passed by (at least 6 - 8? - no binocs), heading southeast in
Saratoga Passage
. I'm located 3 miles north of Langley. It looked like they were angling over toward Camano Head.

8:55 a.m.
First St,
Langley
, WA...Four or five Orcas spotted in the middle of Saratoga Passage, adjacent to downtown Langley... headed South toward Clinton. Traveling swiftly.

I just came back from a call on a yearling Harbor Seal Male, possible Orca attack. Head lacerations (looks just like Orca teeth), fractured skull and jaw, possibly shaken, internal hemorrhaging and still alive. With permission from Dr. Stephanie, we tranquilized and euthanized, I am holding for NMFS. Seal was found on the west side of Camano Island north Madrona Beach area. The attack appears to have happened within the last 24 hours.
