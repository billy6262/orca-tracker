Orca Sightings for January 8, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found the pod of orcas at about

11:30 am
just off the bluff in front of our home/office north of
Greenbank
, and went to the neighbor's bluff to get a better look. They were actively feeding in the riptide between Camano and Whidbey Islands, just off the entrance to Holmes Harbor. At first I could only find 4 - 6 individuals, spread out, milling in all directions and spending most of their time underwater. They continued feeding for about a half hour, then began to head slowly north, though they basically did their disappearing act so were VERY hard to follow or find. But just when I was about to give up, two females with calves appeared close to shore right below me, then a third female with a TINY calf surfaced just beyond them! Then they ALL disappeared! I did finally see one or two other fins, but never got a glimpse of the mom/calf pairs again, but what I saw makes me pretty sure it was K pod, with their brand new calf. I probably saw 12 orcas in all, but again, they were so spread out and stealthy today it was difficult to say for sure. I left them a little after noon, heading north up Saratoga Passage, closer to the Whidbey side.
