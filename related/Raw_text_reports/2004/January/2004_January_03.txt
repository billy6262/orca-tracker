Orca Sightings for January 3, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Petty Officer Brett of the Depoe Bay, OR Coast Guard Station that orcas were sighted off an RV Park in Lincoln City, OR at

3:30
. They were approx. 1 mile offshore, and were milling and moving around with no clear direction of travel.
*
We've just had a pod pass our place on the northwest end of Vashon. We are located about
1.4 miles south of Pt Vashon on Colvos Passage
. The whales appeared to be about 10 in number (wild guess), with one male and one fairly young one. With rough weather conditions and failing light, it was difficult to tell much more than that. The pod was generally on the western side of the Passage, heading northbound, and was clearing the northern entrance to Colvos Passage at approximately

4:45 p.m.
