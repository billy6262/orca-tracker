Orca Sightings for January 12, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a second-hand report of orcas off
Pt. Jefferson
(north of Bainbridge Island) at

2:30 pm
, & are working on getting more details. Also, after reviewing my videotape of the pod off Whidbey Island, I am quite certain it's J pod back in town after being gone for the past month.

I was able to catch up with the orcas at

3:30 pm
, just as they came up
Saratoga Passage
heading north past downtown Langley, Whidbey Island. They were VERY spread out, moving quickly through the area and not spending much time on the surface. But it was a large group of whales (probably 20ish), and I did observe 1 adult male. I followed them north, watched them from Bell's Beach at

4:30 pm
, then caught up with them again at East Point (at the south side of the entrance to Holmes Harbor) at
5 pm
. They were swimming across the entrance to Holmes Harbor toward Greenbank and North Bluff Rd.

Gail Fleming called in a report on this pod from Langley, and then joined me to watch as they passed through town.
