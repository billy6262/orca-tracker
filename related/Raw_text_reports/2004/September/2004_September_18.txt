Orca Sightings for September 18, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Myself, and several other people fishing in the SW Coho Derby, saw LOTS of
orcas
at approximately

10:00 a.m.
(maybe 15-20). From my vantage point in Mutiny Bay, they appeared to be off Olele Pt.(near Mats Mats Bay) In Admiralty Inlet. I saw breaching, tale slaps, etc. from across the inlet. At that time, they were headed N. toward Point Wilson.

We live on Pilot Point (north of Kingston on Kitsap Peninsula & just south of Pt. no Pt.) -- approximately one mile north of the Eglon Boat Ramp. This morning about

8:00 a.m
. we sighted a large
orca
pod (15 or so animals) -- apparently feeding but also appearing to "play" -- i.e. swimming single file in unison, circling back, leaping together, partial breaches, and much blowing etc. There were definitely some males in the group -- with large dorsal fin -- and also what appeared to be juveniles. The currents in the area (just offshore) are extremely strong during tidal changes and this is where they were feeding. The orcas remained in the area for at least an hour (much to our delight).

Transients
T100's and T31 on my side. T100's went east off Port Angles and T31 going west from Sooke area, all at dusk.

Early morning reports had
all 3 pods
(except L12's) slowly making their way North. L12's were reported to be at the Romeo Alpha marker (out past Hein Bank) and headed west, and rumors of
transients
off Victoria were also being reported. So we made the gamble to head South, and we got lucky as we saw
J Pod
porpoising in a neat line, heading from Smith Island towards Cattle Point.

I drove down the west side of Whidbey Island, & found the
orcas
at about

10:30 am
, spread out between Double Bluff on Whidbey & just north of Pt. No Pt. on the Kitsap Peninsula, heading slowly north. At

11:20 am
they were at Bush Pt, on the Whidbey side, very close to shore, traveling in tight groups, doing a lot of tail-lobbing & active behavior. They kept heading north, & I watched them from Lagoon Pt. until about noon, still on the Whidbey side, still actively foraging, lots of breaching! There were at least 3 or 4 males, & so many whales that I'm quite sure it was all 3 pods, though they were so spread out &/or in such tight groups it was very difficult to count. After they passed Lagoon Pt, they begin to spread out again, between Keystone & Ft. Flagler. I continued following them up the west side of Whidbey Island, from Lagoon Pt. to Ledgewood Beach (

12:30 pm
) to Ebey's Landing (
1 -
1:30 pm
), to Partridge Pt (
2 pm
). As they were passing Ebey's Landing, they formed into 3 or 4 resting lines, but continued in a northwesterly direction. At Partridge Pt. there was a pod close to shore, actively breaching & tail-lobbing, and others further out. By

2:45 pm
they were in a resting line again, heading toward Lopez Island, just SE of Iceberg Pt. It was difficult to tell for sure which way they were heading, but it looked like they might have been turning north up into Rosario.

a small group (number?) of
orcas
charged past Ebeys/Pt. Partridge followed a little while later by a large group (30+ ?) spread out, but only 1-2 miles offshore heading north with a couple of whale watch boats...

Spotted a huge
ORCA-
(male?) close to shore (10-30ft.) at Lagoon Pt. heading south. Then a pod further out(200-300ft. ) from shore also heading south. They came by around

9:45AM

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called at
9 am

orcas
was heading north near Pt. No Pt., WA (tip of the Kitsap Peninsula, across from S. Whidbey Island).
