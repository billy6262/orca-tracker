I'd have to guess it was
L-Pod
, but they were pretty far off-shore, heading North (west San Juan Island). Dave said he heard other whales were coming down from up North, so maybe they'd meet up in from of the Center. Later that Night...I heard a blow, followed by dozens of blows. Whales in close to shore, and by the sound of it, it sounded like all three pods! Lots of tailslaps echoed in the still night. A couple of huge splashes that could only have been breaches, and one really cool above water vocalization!
