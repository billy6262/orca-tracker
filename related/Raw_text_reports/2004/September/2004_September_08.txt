Orca Sightings for September 8, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw a pod of
Orcas
frolicking and spouting near the mouth of the Siltcoos River from the Oregon Dunes, just to the south of the Snowy Plover protected area. I kept watching with my binoculars, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Dark creatures, smaller than the whales I'm used to seeing, but with pointy top fins and an occasional show of tail flukes. Lots of sea lions were there too, hanging out in the waves closer to shore, and at first I thought it might be a group of them, but they are so much lighter, and don't have the pointy fins and flukes. It wasn't until I saw the signs posted along the Old Town dock that I was able to give a name to what I had seen.

All 3 Southern
Resident pods
were off the west side of San Juan Island, and spent most of the morning milling about. We had the nursery group from K Pod (K36, K37, and their moms) come up very close to the boat, playing and vocalizing like crazy above water. Tons of baby spy hops with even more vocalizations.
