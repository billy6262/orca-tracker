Orca Sightings for September 6, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were six miles off Dungeness with two
Humpback
whales. A
Minke
surfaced around them and we heard the reports and vocalizations (via radio) of the
Transient
gathering off Victoria. When we left the Humpbacks, they were twelve miles from the Transient Orcas. By Cattle Pass, they were eight miles apart and evening was coming.

The
Humpback
story is great as I had the 2 over by Sequim, 1 off Becher Bay at
1030
and 3 in Johnstone yesterday. At least 6 in the inland waters. This afternoon off Sheringham Pt. (west of Victoria) I would say the greatest gathering of our (
Transient
) Killer whales ever in our area. At least 36, and they all seemed to be ours. I mean from T10's up to at least T61 was the last I had. Also the gray, a minke, a pelican and Dall's. No T31.

We saw a report on the news that Global Research & Rescue followed & filmed 2 adult
humpback
whales in the area between Port Townsend & Sequim Bay.
