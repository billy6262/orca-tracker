============================================================

Entry 1:
Well, were we in for a treat over on San Juan Island...about 30
Orcas
swim by. (Later in a visit to Lime Kiln State Park we learned that all three pods had swum by.)

I was awaken by calls: "
ORCAS

It started off with
T31
(was the general consensus) at the Chain Is. (BC) hunting through the rocks and then heading west along the golf course. We then picked him up again, on our second trip, about 3 miles south of Beacon Hill Park zig zagging west towards William Head, he was hard to watch with long dives, so we left him and headed to Crescent Bay to see the
Grey Whale
. Enroute we picked up a good group of Dalls Porpoise SW of the VG marker. In Crescent Bay we ended up with 2 greys, the juvenile and what looked like an adult that swam right under us. We had a quick stop at Race to see the sealions just as
T31
was making his approach to Race from the east. Once we were out of the reserve we could see him circle the rocks as he tagged a number of animals in there.

Early morning had
all three pods
of Southern Residents heading up the west side of San Juan, passing Low Island around

6:45 AM
. They continued on up Swanson Channel, through Active Pass and went on up to the Fraser River. Fortunately we found two
transients
(T12 & T12A) feeding just south of James Island. Tom on Stellar Sea called and let us know they made a kill while he was watching, and it appeared that they did one kill while we were on scene, and another about 30 minutes after we left. We also heard a call on the radio that a dozen Pacific White-sided
dolphins
were seen in Speiden channel, but were gone by the time we got there.

We located a rather large (12+) group of
transients
today just at the Georgia Strait side of Active Pass. They milled about at the opening of the Pass for awhile, then set off in a mostly Northerly direction. They were travelling with a pattern of 3 breaths, then a longer dive, but definitely not resting as the group would come together on some dives, split apart on others and sometimes porpoise during their breaths. We have yet to ID these whales, but are reasonably sure that they were transients. There were 2 large males, 1 with a very wide dorsal that had 2 big ripples on the trailing edge, and 1 female with a definite large nick at the base of her dorsal. We also saw several juveniles. No vocals were heard. Photos should be back by tomorrow and will hopefully help with ID's. The group did pass by one seal without attacking it - guess they had already eaten in Active Pass. When we left these whales, they were meandering northbound along Galiano Island, about 2 miles into the Strait of Georgia.
We headed back to Active Pass just in time to catch up to the southern residents.
K pod and J pod
passed through seperately with K pod aparently taking the more direct route to the coal docks, while J pod headed northeast towards the river.
