Orca Sightings for September 12, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
A beautiful day on the water with
all three pods
once again off the west side of San Juan Island. I don't think the whales have hardly foraged past Lime Kiln or Cattle Point for 4 days now! The whales were very spread out over a 2 mile area, milling and foraging.
