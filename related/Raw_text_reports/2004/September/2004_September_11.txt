In response to the Sept. 10 Gray whale sighting off the Vashon ferry: We did send a boat out to this area and also had a 2nd report. The other report was of 2 humpback whales and on the boat trip by Erin Falcone and Jessie Huggins from Cascadia, they found and IDed a single humpback whale who by then was further south off Redondo. Erin and Jessie are back out today (Sept. 13) checking on a sighting of a whale in Dana Passage that could be the same humpback or a different whale.
