Orca Sightings for September 17, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
residents
decided to take a little stroll Friday evening by heading down south of Port Townsend, which made us a little concerned about seeing them on Saturday.

Looked like
all three pods
off Limekiln at
8 am
. The climax was having L-57 and most likely K-20 having a little tryst just outside the kelp bed. Lunging, head standing, cart-wheels, breaches, tail lobs, chin-ups, logging, surface vocals...you name it they were doing it. Approximately 10-15 individuals well inside Deadman's Bay.

Orcas
heading east quite quickly at
7pm
at the southern tip of trial island tonight, approximately 3/4 mile offshore. Saw them from the Chinese cemetary in Victoria.

The Odyssey left Friday Harbor at
1 PM
and headed out to the Salmon Banks where all
pods
were reported to be feeding and slowly moving offshore. ...at Cattle Pass ... at 2 miles we could see dorsals and spouts. When we arrived on scene the whales were spread out and foraging as they moved. We saw at least one with a silver salmon in her mouth and heard the hunting clicks as they swam by. I know it's not correct to ascribe human feelings to animals but the whales seemed content. They were well fed and still feeding as they grazed on the incoming fish. ... near the Salmon Bank buoy... a Minke surfaced dead ahead and 100 yards out. I chopped the engines and we sat and watched as the whale surfaced and slowly moved in a predictable line for the next 15 minutes. While the Orca always seems aware and interacting with the surface world, the Minke seems aloof and unconcerned with us. They are not as interesting to watch from a behavioral standpoint but they grow on you after awhile. They have large alien lives lived very differently than ours. Graceful and slow, their realm seems more below the surface than our local pods.
