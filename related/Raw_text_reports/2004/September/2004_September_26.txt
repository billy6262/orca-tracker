Orca Sightings for September 26, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were traveling slowly on our boat from Edmonds at about

4:30 PM
and we were about 5 miles south when we spotted a large pod of
Orcas
. We stopped the boat and the Orcas came to the boat and frollicked around the boat for about 10 minutes. There was at least 6 and they were not traveling in any direction. They appeared to be relatively small but my wife saw a couple of larger whales that did not approach the boat. They were playing and possibly feeding as we also saw salmon jumping out of the water in the area. The Orcas disappeared as quickly as they appeared and we couldn't tell in which direction they headed.

Doug, Jodi, Kelp and I were all doing some work at Lime Kiln today around

11:30
when we heard whale blows through the fog. We ran up to the top of the light and searched through the mist...heard some incredible vocalizations on SeaSound Radio 89.1 FM and then the first few came into view. Had mostly
L's
at first (photos for sure of L-32, 85, 25, 41) but then had some
J's
as well (photos J-26, 16, 35). Amongst the ususal J-clan calls we heard what we could only describe as barnyard braying...they sounded like cows, donkeys, chickens and Dougs says, 'definately a drowning cat'...weird. Lots of lunging and milling near the lighthouse. A fun perspective through the fog and from the light. Many folks at the park were thrilled.

J's K's and most of L's
in Swanson Ch. going to Active Pass with the
L12's

... through the pea soup that blanketed the South end of the islands to emerge near Stuart Island/Turn Point in beautiful sun. Even better,
all 3 pods
were together for a change, slowly making their way North. The whales were spread out in groups over a distance of about 3/4 of a mile, and we had a nice visit with L Pod. As we were heading back towards Turn Point to look at the beautiful lighthouse, we saw the L-12's lurking in the bull kelp beds.
