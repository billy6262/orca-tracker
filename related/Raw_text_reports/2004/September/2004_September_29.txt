Orca Sightings for September 29, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
The L12's ... came up north just past Hannah Heights, then turned south again. At between

2:30 and
3:00 p.m
. just north of Eagle Point, the L12's greeted
J's, K's and the rest of L pod
. They were heading north, apparently after coming through Rosario Strait and around Lopez. For some time before that there had been breaching, cart wheeling, tail slapping, etc. from both groups. After the L12's joined up with the others there was amazing socializing and mating behavior for the next several hours. I was watching from above Hannah Heights for a long time. At one point the behavior was somewhat confusing. Right on the shoreline I saw a group of about 6 to 8 females or immature males rolling around together for about 10 to 15 minutes without any seeming involvement from sprouters or mature males. I was fairly certain that mating should involve both sexes, but I appeared to be mistaken. Finally a sprouter emerged from the depths. About 2 minutes after that L57 appeared, followed about 2 minutes later by L41. Mystery resolved! Then the males disappeared, the females continued rolling about, and the males reappeared several more times at about five minute intervals.
