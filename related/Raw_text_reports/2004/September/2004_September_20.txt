At first, the
whales
were moving in tight knit groups along the southern end of Lopez Island. First
K-Pod
came by, no vocalizations or percussives, just a nice leisurely pace. Then as the boats moved, we saw another group of whales approaching. Turns out it was
J-Pod
, and they were in a boisterous mood! As they passed Tom on the Stellar Sea, they began to get very active, with lots of tailslaps, spyhops, and a few breaches. Then they came to us, and it was like watching school kids going out for recess--lots of pushing and surfacing on top of each other. Later, the whales did the usual speed run across Cattle Point, and put on one of the loudest vocalization performances I've ever heard!
