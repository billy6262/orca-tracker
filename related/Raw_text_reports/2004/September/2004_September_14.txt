The Center for Whale Research (west side San Juan Island) had
J's & L's
going by at about
6 pm
.

The
Offshore orcas
have returned to western Johnstone Strait and are presently off Weynton Pass. It's not yet sure whether they will keep heading west past Alert Bay or go north through Weynton Pass, but it looks like they are on their way "out" again. They have been silent when in range of our hydrophones.
