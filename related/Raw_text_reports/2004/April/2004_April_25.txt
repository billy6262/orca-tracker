Orca Sightings for April 25, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were also
grays
off of Scatchet Head (Cultus Bay)--due south out quite a bit--over a mile off shore, so very hard to report any details. Not sure how many whales were present, but saw spouts for at least two hours--between
11AM and 1PM.

Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called in a report of one
gray whale
south of Hat Island, heading north at

5:40 pm
*
We saw two
grays
and one of them actually dove and stuck his tail out of the water at

7:35 PM.
They were actually quite close to shore off Mukilteo's Chennault Beach between Harbour Pointe and Olympic Terrace which is south of the Mukilteo Ferry. They were heading north, spouting and seemingly following the shoreline.
Janet Eaton, Mukilteo.

Two more
gray whales at
6:40 a.m.
off the west end of First St in
Langley
, leisurely feeding close along the shoreline, and making those wonderfully loud and distinctive whale blowing noises - traveling slowly east toward downtown.
