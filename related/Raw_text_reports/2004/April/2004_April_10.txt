Orca Sightings for April 10, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 grays at Mabana Shores (Camano Island) at

9:30am
. My interpretation is that it was a mother and calf. My observation was of a Large adult covered in barnacles with a smaller whale, one third the size of the adult. The smaller whale stayed close to the side of the adult (extremely close). They fed for an hour and moved off to the drop off area and proceeded N. into the passage. On the l2th a large gray came to the tidal flats at Mabana in the pm and fed for 45 minutes and went to the middle of passage, where it stayed for over an hour.
