============================================================

Entry 1:
8:20 pm
heard the whoosh! whoosh! of
grays
right off our bluff! We went to our neighbor's overlook, & watched 2 grays feeding off Hidden Beach (north of Greenbank), moving slowly to the north. A wonderful way to end the day!!

Have been watching 2 grays feeding about 250 yards out at First & Park for the last 15 minutes (6 am). Their whole bodies are visible because the shallow water. When the tide goes out you can see the indentations from their feeding. What a way to start your day. Bettina Fisher, Langley

I watched two
gray whales
feeding in the shallow water off of
Langley
this mornin, from
5 AM - 6 AM
. They would feed, rolling on their sides for about 20 minutes and then head out into the deeper water circle back and feed again. The 2 whales did this three times and then headed off toward Camano Island. I believe they then headed east.
