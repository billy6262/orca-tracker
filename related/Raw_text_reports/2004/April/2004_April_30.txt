Orca Sightings for April 30, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
7PM
we were surprised to see a pod of
Orca
from
Cherry Point
along the Strait of Georgia in Whatcom County (48 50' N, 122 43' W). We have frequented this area for years and this is the first time we have ever seen Orca here. We estimate 20-30 individuals including males. The pod was spread out for a couple of miles. They were moving south, with some individuals within 1500 feet of shore.

We found
J's
at the T10 can between the North and South arms of the Fraser River around 11 am this morning. They reached the Iona Jetty by the airport before turning south at

11:45 am
, moving slowly, mainly milling.
What a great day for whales.

Saw a lone
gray
about
5PM
, heading fairly rapidly north to Mabana (west Camano). Once it reached the shallows off Mabana, it spent considerable time feeding, with lots of flukes and tail fins. Gradually proceeded north along the shallows until it was out of sight. Also saw a lone
gray
about

11:30 AM
mid channel between Mabana and East Point. Probably the one already reported from Whidbey.

I heard
J pod
on the hydrophone at
0010
this morning. I was hearing calls at least until
0030
but they were getting drowned out by a couple of freighters. I dont know what direction they were going.
