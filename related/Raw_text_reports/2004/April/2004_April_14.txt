I spotted two whales!!!! It was my first time and I could see them from my back door. I live on the west side of Camano Island along Saratoga Passage at the end of Camano Hill Road.

I picked up T61 (V1 old ID) aka Victor approaching Race Rocks at
1615
. I watched him chase down a harbor porpoise with ease (first kill of the year!) just south of Race Rocks. I saw close to 100 harbor porpoise on my morning trip in this area. I left him at
1700
east bound one mile south of Race Rocks.

Someone called & left a message that they saw 3 or 4 whales off Hidden Beach in Greenbank early this afternoon.

Not much to tell, but I watched what appeared to be a single gray, spraying mist about half a dozen times out front of Bells Beach, mid passage, heading south toward Langley. This was all about

6:05 PM
.

TWO PAIR of gray whales were up with the lark this morning. The second pair did the same at about
7a
. This was at the West end of First St in Langley, and they headed south, past The Dog House toward Sandy Point. Traveling in pairs, they swam close to shore this day, so for awhile you had to be at the bluff edge to see them.
