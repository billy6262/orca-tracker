Orca Sightings for April 20, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient T61 off Victoria this afternoon just wandering around, seen going back towards Race Rocks at
1600
.
Ron Bates
MMRG, Victoria

Just saw one, probably two grays across from Sandy Point, just north of Camano Head,

1:30 PM
. Saw enough blows to guess at two by the positioning, and some body exposure. They were pretty close to the Camano side.

9:22 am
