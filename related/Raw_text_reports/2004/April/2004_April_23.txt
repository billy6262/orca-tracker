Orca Sightings for April 23, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
...two grays feeding not far off the shores of the west end of First St, Langley - still visible beginning about
8pm
. I followed them downtown, viewing them from the minipark and "boy who never tires of the view" sculpture, and then Dang! if they didn't turn right around and head back to MY HOUSE just up the hill!!! So I returned and sure enough I could hear them feeding off my backyard - an hour earlier than last night.

Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called in a report of 2 grays between Hat Island and Everett at
11 am
, with one of them
spy-hopping!
He said it was the classic spy-hop, head out of the water taking a look around - this is something else we don't often see grays do in these waters, yet see below for another report of a spy-hopping gray from Thursday evening.....

Ed Young of Whidbey Island Kayaking called in a report of 2 grays at

10:30 am
off Langley Marina headed north; then at

11:30 am
he saw 1 gray one mile north of the marina.

Sometimes it is a good thing when BC Ferries are behind schedule. Today at about
11 a.m
. we saw a group of 6-8 orcas hugging the shoreline of Galiano Island at the east end of Active Pass. Lots of jumping by the younger, smaller whales, and tail-slapping too.

At

11:50 am
a friend of ours spotted 4 Orcas on the ferry going through Active Pass. There is no ID on the whales, but they were east bound through Active. Possibly J's?

Karen Eaton of Greenbank called at

3:40 pm
to let us know a gray whale was off Holmes Harbor Estates (just n. of the Greenbank Farm), heading south. Right in our neighborhood, & I missed it!

Susan, I just saw a whale at
6 PM
. Now, I am fairly good at identifying but I am not sure if this was a gray or a humpback. My inclination is that it was a humpback. I saw only one heading north, spouting twice and a roll with a small amount of tail showing. I am in Mukilteo, south of the ferry--in the Harbour Pointe area. It was more toward the Mukilteo side than Whidbey. This was so cool.

Just saw 4 spouts between Langley and Camano, closer to Camano and headed that way. (About
7 PM
) Also heard that at least 2 were feeding near Langley at
8:30 this morning and at 9 last night.
