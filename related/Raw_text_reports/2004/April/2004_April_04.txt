Orca Sightings for April 4, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had 2 gray whales heading south, just off shore from the Estes buoy. Both were spouting. They were slowly heading southeast and continually spouting and rising as they headed across the bay. This would be on the east side of Camano, Port Susan, about right across from Kayak Pt. park.

Just as the sun was setting, J-Pod decided to pass by my house (west San Juan Island) while I was outside around

6:30 PM
. They were very spread out, and heading slowly South.

I received a call from John Boyd at around
1900
this evening giving me the heads up of whales heading south off the County Park (west side of San Juan Island). I was downstairs and missed them but drove down the Westside. I saw a few very spread out whales at
1920
just south of Deadman's Bay still heading south and the only whale I really got my binocs on had to be J31. I saw one whale farther down the Westside do a lunge like it was chasing a salmon. Val Veirs's class said they heard a LOT of echolocation earlier.

7:45 am
- I've been watching two gray whales spouting mid-channel in the Saratoga Passage just south of Irenella Beach off Camano. One boat has been observing at some distance, another just powered rapidly through the area where I have seen them having their morning frolic.
