J Pod was sighted this morning near Pt. Roberts by Vancouver Whale Watch, Lightship 1. We got to spend time with them on both trips today. We left them headed south, south of Sucia Island at about

Mike Bennett called at

1:30 pm
to report the 2 gray whales they'd seen earlier were now milling about 1 mile off Cultus Bay, possibly heading in a westerly direction. Cascadia Research staff were on board, and think these 2 are not ones yet ID'd this year - they will have more information once they look at their photos

At about

5:00
we are watching 2 or 3 whales heading south just off of point no point.

It's about

6:20pm
. We sent an earlier report that the gray whales were heading south by Point-No-Point. Well, it looked like they were heading towards Kingston, but then they turned around and started back north again. They're heading towards Clinton now.

Two Grey whales

7:20 am
at Spee-Bi-Dah (Port Susan). (48.09, 122.32) They seemed to be just passing through. They were only around for about 5 minutes which is unusual. They usually feed for at least 20 minutes in the 1/2 mile in front of us. One was the one we call "Trim Tail". Got a really good look at the tail this time and it is the right side of the tail that is damaged, not the left as we previously reported. Did not get good look at other.
