Well I missed the spouts of two

in front of Bells Beach but spotted them spouting in between Camano and Fox spit at

8:10pm
big lone
gray
meandering Northwest past East Point close to shore headed into the sunset (NW).
David Day
Fox Spit Rd
Whidbey Island

Well
grays
can be so unpredictable. The two I saw earlier, turned south and came back to Bells Beach. (

8:35 PM
) They have been out here for a while going every which way. They are VERY close to shore and cant think of a better way to end this day. Beautiful sunset and calm waters, with the noisy blows from two such majestic creatures. We are certainly blessed.

11:30 pm
- I'm pretty sure I could hear a few puffs in the distance every few minutes, followed by gulls talking, so I think the
grays
weren't too far from Greenbank.

Mary Pacher (neighbor) left a message at
2 pm
that there is another huge
gray
off North Bluff/Greenbank, heading SE.
*
J pod
