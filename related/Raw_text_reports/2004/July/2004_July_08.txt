Orca Sightings for July 8, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Welcome back
K pod
! A day of celebration for all....we had the great fortune to be out with the
J's and K's
within the first few hours of their summer reunion here in the islands! When we got there (
1545
, south of Pt. Roberts), they were all traveling together, spread out in small groups all across the Strait of Georgia. There was a LOT of breaching, spyhops, tail lobs, porpoising, and swimming upside down going on. Saw a very weeny orange one that may be the new K baby?!?
We heard a rumor that some
L's
were heading towards Pt. Lawrence to perhaps meet up with the group. At about
2030
we found them rounding the corner at Pt. Lawrence into Rosario Strait, still widely spread out in small groups. Ruffles (J1), Capuccino (K21) and an un-ID'ed female - were all rolling around each other, sideways, upside down, chasing - though I have to say it looked like ol' Ruffles was doing most of the work and Capuccino was more on the sidelines (tho close) "observing".

J's and K's
met up today just off of Point Roberts. We had been watching the J's forage for a bit and they all of a sudden grouped up and quickly moved north - I had not seen so much porpoising all season. I didn't know it, but at the same time, Ed, our captain, noticed another group moving quickly south. They sure seemed excited to get together. They met up at about

1:40
and the socializing began. It was wonderful to see their reunion!

The afternoon trips for VWW met up with
J & K pods
north of Alden Bank at about

3:00 pm
. The whales were very spread out and when we left them at about

4:15
, they appeared to be heading south down Rosario Strait, although they could still have gone West in either Boundary Pass or President's Channel.
