Orca Sightings for July 17, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Coast Whale Report:
Another report of a big pod of orcas off Cape Blanco, Oregon. The caller said he had talked to a Ranger in the area, and had been told this pod had been around for several days, following 2 gray whale calves that were in the area.

About
11 AM
we headed out from Snug Harbor, west side of San Juan Island, and went south where we heard all three pods had been seen. About 15 minutes later we found them off False Bay, where the shallow banks begin to rise off the deep canyons of Haro Strait, and where we found baitfish, probably sand lance (candlefish), hopping in the air all around us. The whales were not in mingling parties, even though all three pods were in sight, but in scattered groups heading all directions, apparently foraging. At first we were with some L's who occasionally played on the surface, including some spyhops that seemed intended to check us out. Snapping photo-ID's and churning out videos, we traveled parallel to shore past Lime Kiln lighthouse and on up to Open Bay, where we found tight groups of
K's
in full gallop toward Kellet Bluff. After rounding Kellet we found
J's
in two tight bunches, one after the other, all hellbent toward Stuart Island, miles northward. In the distance were two other groups, probably K's, also powering north. In the lead group were J2 (Granny) at over 90 still in the race in the thick of the group, and just behind her was J1 (Ruffles) also in tight formation with the pod. It was great to see them in all their joyous glory.

We had
J Pod, K Pod, and L-Pod
out and about today! Not traveling all together by the time we saw them, so technically not a superpod, but close enough for me! First were the J's & K's, traveling slow and in very tight groups as they passed Speiden Channel heading north. Then the L's were coming up aways back from the main group. L-57 and family gave us a nice slow pass, coming up in groups of 8-10. The blows were fabulous in the still air and smooth waters. You could hear it echo off of Stuart Island. No vocalizations though (come to think of it, I haven't heard any vocalizations in the last few days.)
