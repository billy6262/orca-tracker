Orca Sightings for July 23, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
They passed by San Juan County Campground at about

3:30 p.m. All 3 pods
passed by. Most were quite far out, but about 15 of them close enough to cause us to "ooooh" and "aaaah". They were resolute in just swimming by (no breaching or playing). We then drove back to Lime Kiln Pt. in time to see this same 15 or so Orcas swimming by at much closer range. One or two mom's and babes swimming in that beautiful tandem way. One male came in pretty close. Another group of about 4 whales got together and began doddling and swimming closer in.

Rowena Williamson of Coupeville called to tell us about her amazing day with the whales today! They were out with Capt. Jack's Charters, and were with some
L pod
whales off the south end of San Juan Island, & had the wonderful experience of watching a pair of orcas mate right near the boat! She said first she heard someone say "look at THAT!", then they saw two orcas belly to belly just underwater, and also saw their flukes come up out of the water wrapped around each other. She said a third whale was nearby the mating pair.

I only observed
J's & L's
as the whales were quite spread out as they rounded Turn Point. Today the whales gave us a primer on whale behavior. We started with basics of just traveling in groups, then individually, adding a couple of tail slaps as they approached the middle of Speiden Channel. Then they progressed to spyhops, a few cartwheels, and then the breaching contest began. One whale (who only revealed his belly) breached near the boat no less than 9 times. All this time, the cool sounds of the orca "choir" were playing over the hydrophone. We had a few behaviors left to view, and the whales obliged with an example of porpoising, and a very close, slow underwater pass as they decided to do the "old unexpected course change maneuver."
