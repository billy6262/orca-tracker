Orca Sightings for July 20, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approx.

7:15 a.m.
PDT I was watching the
Race Rocks remote controlled Cam #5
when I witnessed a Transient kill of a sea-lion. It appeared to be two hunting together, one male, one female. The pic. quality was not superb but I'm pretty sure I recognized both a male and female dorsal fin.
