Orca Sightings for July 18, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's, K's & L's
spread out over several miles along the west side of San Juan Island. While floating about a mile off the shore, we saw several whales break off the main group and approach the boat. As they approached, we were able to ID J-28 (Polaris). As she passed by the boat, she began to vocalize in a way that I have never heard. We were all surprised and our guests thought maybe I was fooling around with the microphone but it wasn't me---Polaris did a call that can be best described as a whale imitation of Curly from the 3 Stooges. About 7 short woo woo woo type sounds (I know I'm not doing it justice in my description).
