Orca Sightings for July 15, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

1:50pm
, we spotted a lone killer whale off of Beechy Head just south of Sooke (west of Victoria). From what I saw it would appear to have been a male because it had a huge dorsal fin. He was heading south bound towards Race Rocks. We saw him porpoise 6 times during the 20 minutes we were in visual contact with him. Could have been a transient?

Orcas porpoising in front of the old Lime Kilns just North of the lighthouse. Too far to ID, but it was neat to see the foraging activity from our eagle's point of view!
