Orca Sightings for July 28, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales slowly passing by the house this
morning
(west side San juan Island). Looks like
J's, K's, and L's
slowly heading North. Later, around

1:30
, I saw a big L male (that the Center later told me was L-79) and several smaller whales just hanging out near Balcomb Reef (Andrews Bay). They turned and went back south where I spotted them around
6 PM
at False Bay. Rest of the whales went to the Fraser River Buffet (all you can eat salmon).

We had a
superpod
pass the ligthouse today starting at

11:30
. Js and Ks were first, cutting across right towards us from Victoria. Ls were a little behind them, but also made their way to the north. At

12:15
, when the first of the Ls were in front of us, I noticed two whales apparently logging. As I lifted my binoculars to try and get some IDs, I noticed that they weren't logging at all but were actually pushing an object across the surface. All I was able to pick up about the object was that it was gray, limp, and had a fin. The whales both dove with it, and by the time they resurfaced they had rejoined the rest of L-Pod and the object was gone. It's likely that they were playing with a salmon, but in light of recent incidents involving L-Pod, I thought this may be worth mentioning.
