Orca Sightings for July 7, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Johnstone Strait recap
The lastest scenerio is that the Orca that passed by Campbell River may have been the
K's
. Interesting isn't. Here is the time line.

10:45 am
- reports of 3 large male orca heading down Nodales Passage at

9:00 am

1:45 pm
- Orca (20 plus) porpoise through Seymore Narrows against a 8 kt tide.

2:30 pm
- Orca vocalizing but unregonizable

3:30 pm
- I break away from the Orca group as they approach Painter's Lodge (boat traffic is high here) and head into Gowland Harbour where I find an unusual number of harbour seals (150) on the rocks and very agitated.

5:30 pm
- Orca at Mittlenatch Is. and still heading south If the time line is correct and these were the K's and somebody else (2 large dorsal fins) they would have appeared down there yesterday. As it turned out up here is that the A4's, A30's and A36's (the 3 large males that i couldn't find) turned up back in Johnstone strait the next day. (we are trying to figure out how far east they travelled before turning around) Note: the harbour seals up here recognize the vocalization of the northern residents and do not freak out when they come through. These Gowland harbour seals treated these orca as though they were tranients. Could it be that they just didn't recognize the southern dialects??

coming right across Open Bay. Nice. As the morning progressed, the whales continued to be the whale amoeba--joining together, then splitting apart, and joining again. J's & L's then spent a majority of the day milling in a nice group about a mile or so off of Pile Point.

were off the west side of San Juan Island the entire day. From about
4 to 7 pm
they did the westside shuffle from Pile Point to Eagle Point to north of Lime Kiln and back south again. I think I saw more breaching today than all other days combined. The rougher the water, the more they seemed to breach. One juvenile breached more than 20 times on what I think was J1. L57 got into the act by doing upside down tail slaps and waving his pecs.

Just got a call (

7:50 am
) that there are Orcas in Boundry Pass headed toward San Juan Island. Lots of them. Most likely a lot of the Ls and the Js, the same group that went north yesterday afternoon.
