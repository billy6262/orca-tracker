Orca Sightings for July 25, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Near Race Rocks, we enjoyed many whales swimming toward and then by us while others were widely spread out in this area.
All 3 pods
. Mothers and babies. Ruffles for sure. Some at very close range. Moving along at high speed. A bit of porpoising and breaching.
