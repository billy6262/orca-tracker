Orca Sightings for July 10, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures in Anacortes reported a minke whale (they call him "Chopper", as he has no dorsal fin) Saturday at Salmon Bank.
*
Swanson Channel with some of
L-Pod
. The L's were heading North slowly, probably to join up with the bulk of whales that headed that way in the morning. Reports of L-12's down at Eagle Point came in later in the day.

This morning we had
J, K
heading northbound and a small group of
L's
that later turned back south. We had id's on K7, K11, K12, K37, K31, and K28. We also had a great opportunity to see some of the late arrival L's: L22, L79, L32, L85, L87?, L89?

...lots of Orcas going by headed north for Lime Kiln Lighthouse on the west side of San Juan Island. Just cruising pretty fast, but some back flips and breaching as they went by.
