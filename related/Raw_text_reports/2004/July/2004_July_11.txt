Orca Sightings for July 11, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Contrary to my original report of only
J's & L's
, we discovered that mixed in with Ruffles and Granny from J-Pod, and Gaia from L-Pod, were none other than
K7 (Lummi) and K-11 (Georgia)
.

Around

8:30 a.m
. there were a whole lot of whales going south off of LandBank (just south of Lime Kiln). It seemed to be all of them. After foraging most of the morning off Hannah Heights and farther south, they all went north at around noon. The
L12's and friends
apparently broke off and went south again, because they were foraging off Hannah Heights at about

5:00 p.m
. Then the L12's started north fairly rapidly, but many stopped right around Deadman Bay and formed a greeting line. At about the same time whales were porpoising down from the north. About ten or more of them also formed a greeting line. The two lines met at Deadman Bay. It was one of the less exuberant greeting ceremonies I have seen between sub-pods, but still very nice to watch.

J's & L's
traveled slowly north up Speiden Channel. A couple of spy hops as they crossed the channel, but overall they were in very tight groups. It was thrilling to see up to 20 whales at once coming up for a breath of air.
