Orca Sightings for July 1, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales came up the west side by the house in the early afternoon heading North at a fairly leisurely pace. But then later in the day, I got a chance to go and see
J-Pod
near Active Pass. We finally spotted the
J's
off Point Roberts heading for the Frasier River. The group was putting on quite the display of power, with over 40 breaches, tons of porpoising, lobtailing, cartwheels. No vocalizations. Mike put on quite a demonstration of how to catch a salmon with the help of his family. Even Ruffles was acting up with several cartwheels and huge tail slaps of his own!
