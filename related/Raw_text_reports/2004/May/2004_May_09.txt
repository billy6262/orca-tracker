- EastPoint,
J Pod
heading east, north past Tumbo Is
Saturna Island Orca Watch
*
My son and husband were kayaking off the south end of Vashon Island and saw a lone
Orca
heading north. They were just north of the Tahlequah ferry on the east side. My husband said what they saw of the whale (it's back and dorsal) was all black.

This sounds to me like it was likely the lone
Pseudorca
or False Killer Whale that travels Puget Sound & BC waters - sb
*
I just talked to a man who saw 3 orcas (male, female, juvenile) off Pt. Defiance from

16:15 to
17:30
heading E. More transients I guess.

Great afternoon with J-Pod around Saturna Island. They were slowly working the currents as they made their way towards Eastpoint. Many times most of the pod would come up together, which made for a beautiful view of the family. Granny surrounded by her family on Mother's Day.... :)

J's
are very spread out heading north along the west side of San Juan Island at
