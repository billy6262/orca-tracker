============================================================

Entry 1:
...
J-Pod
near Cattle Pass (S. San Juan Island). Most of J-Pod was very spread out, but we were able to see Ruffles, Mike, Oreo, Doublestuff, Cookie (Oreo's newly named youngster) and others.

While on the Clinton ferry this morning (

11:05am
) we saw a couple of heart shaped blows as we were leaving Clinton. Possibly two
grays
headed north towards Possession Point/Clinton area. Too far away for confident ID.

Our second visit from the lone
Gray
today, this time on the Camano side of Saratoga Passage off Mabana. About

5:30 PM
, noticed the neighbors looking out over the bank and pointing so went out to join in watching the lone gray make his way north/west fairly close to shore, then stop to feed at Mabana.
