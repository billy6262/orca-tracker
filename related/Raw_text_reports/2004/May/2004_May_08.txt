Orca Sightings for May 8, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Harrington Lagoon, Coupeville area outside of Penn cove. In our boat. A large pod of
orcas 6-8
with a young baby, they were playing with a large seal, for 2 hours before feeding time. It looked as though they were teaching the baby how to hunt.

I also wanted to report orca whales sightings at Penn cove Sat
May 8th around

5:10pm
. There were around 6 of them with some smaller dolphins (I believe these were probably the two smaller orca calves - sb).

Great day for the whales at Saratoga Passage just south of Polnell Pt. I was very excited two see two young
Orcas
, one of them still had a pink tint to its white markings. This all took place about

2:00 pm
. We stayed with them till about

4:00-
4:30
or so. They took off at full speed toward Snakelum pt. The pod appeared to have 2-3 Males and same in females and then the two young'ins.

Same
Transients
,

12:30 to
3:30 pm
Polnell Point. We were treated to a view of the two or three adults and two or three babies, one of which was peach or pink still! It was my best sighting ever! I got to see my first spy hop, first tail flukes, both adults and baby ones, a fin wave, a few breaches, and lots of enjoyable views of white eye patches and tummies. The water was glassy, the air was silent and calm, we drifted silently around the edge of the vicinity with our sails up and heard the whales breathe and splash and swoosh.

We watched the
Transients
from the Coupeville Wharf from

6:30 -
7:15 pm
, from the NW side of Penn Cove to the entrance of the cove. As they reached the entrance there was some lunging, spy-hopping, and whales going in every direction, so it's likely they made a kill there. They then kept heading out toward Polnell Pt until they were out of sight.

Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called to report one
gray
whale a mile south of Hat Island at

6:15 pm
.

We also observed the
Orca
pod off Lovejoy Point inside of Penn Cove. I first saw what I thought was a lone
'Minki' whale
traveling very fast on the surface into Penn Cove at about
1630
hr. About 300-400 yards behind was a pod of Orcas (4-6) that appeared to be trailing the first whale. As of
1730
hr the whales were still inside Penn Cove in choppy water well off the Coupeville wharf. They came into Penn Cove at 1630 hr and left at 1930hr. A lot of spy hopping, fin waving group tailing. Mostly along the tide/current line just off the shore of Love Joy Point about 200 yds from the beach. They left along the same route/area they came into the cove. They would spend time grouped up and in the same spot with a lot of activity then move off underwater. Although we took some video it is doubtfull any identifcation could be made. They entered the cove with the flood tide and left around slack.

My daughter and I saw the penn cove
orcas
this evening. It was about

6:30 p.m.
Everyone in the restaurant quit eating and all gathered at the window to watch the pod. I'm guessing somewhere between 6 or 7.

After reading the report on the
transients
I decided to head over to Penn Cove for a look. As luck would have it, they were still there. I saw two on the south side of Penn Cove heading east. I was parked at Monroe landing. I saw the Transients at
7 pm
and they were making a steady course towards Camano island. I counted the amount stated earlier.

At
1730
we received a call from Judy Lynn of Coupeville, reporting the
orca
pod still in Penn Cove, along the north side (San de Fuca area).

Cindy Hansen of Mosquito Fleet called with an update on the
Transient orcas
at
1 pm
- they were in Penn Cove & had made a sea lion kill. She said it was the T46's & others, with approximately 8 whales in the group, including the young calf they had seen with them last year.

Jeff Hogan called with a
J pod
report from San Juan Island - they were rounding Iceberg Pt. at

9:45 am
, heading up to the Eagle Pt./Pile Pt area at noon, then turning around and back south to Cattle Pass -
2 pm
heading south.

Hi Susan, had
J pod
coming up from the South end of San Juan island today. Spotted them heading North off Salmon Bank
0948
this morning.
Jodi Smith

J-Pod

Mike Bennett of Mosquito Fleet called at

10:40 am
to report a small pod of
orcas
between Polnell Pt. & the entrance buoy to Oak Harbor, NE whidbey island. There are 4 adults and a calf, and they have ID'd two of the orcas as T46 & T47, so they are indeed transients, & likely the pod that was in Port Susan yesterday. Mike said they were moving slowly, headed east toward Polnell Pt.
*
Frank Taylor just called with a report of 3 adults & one juvenile orca north of Harrington Lagoon at the entrance to Penn Cove, headed toward Oak Harbor at 9 am. Hmmm - better go see if I can find them! Folks up north on Whidbey & Camano, keep your eyes open for this small pod of orcas, likely transients....let us know if you see them!
