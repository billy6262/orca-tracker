============================================================

Entry 1:
The best report I have came from my son at

7:30-8am
. "WHALES!" at Lime Kiln Lighthouse about 20 animals passing by with NO BOATS escorting! We later found out it was

...
J-Pod
passing by (west side San Juan Island). They were spread out, with Ruffles (J-1) about a mile offshore while the rest of the group moved slowly North closer in. They weren't in any hurry and we caught up to them later in the day near Active Pass. We last saw J's heading into Active Pass on their way to Pt. Roberts.
