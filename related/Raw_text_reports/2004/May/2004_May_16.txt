Entry 1:
Found
J pod
extremely spread out foraging just south of Point Roberts in the afternoon. J1 out in front. Within the first 10 minutes we witnessed a large minke whale cruising in among the whales, not more than 20 feet from a half a dozen members of J pod.

J pod
way spread out between Lummi Island and Orcas today making their way relatively slowly south to Rosario Strait, from about
1400 to 1630
- some spectacular completely out of the water breaches by, i believe, a couple of the young fellers in the group! Some milling, chasing - some were as close in as Lummi Rocks, others were way over by Orcas Island, Pt. Lawrence.
