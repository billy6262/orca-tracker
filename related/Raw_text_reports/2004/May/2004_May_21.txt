Orca Sightings for May 21, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
Between

18:00 and
18:30
, I observed a large (40-50 ft.)
fin whale
[
probably a humpback - see
May 17 report
] (identified by the size, distinctive dorsal fin and white markings on the undersides of the flukes) at approximately 47 deg. 20 min. N and 123 deg. 32.5 min. W. This is about halfway between Dalco Pt. On Vashon Island and the Point Defiance (Tacoma) ferry dock. It was tail splashing about twice a minute. No boats were present. As a tow with two barges approached, the whale stopped surface activity. Observations were made with a 60X telescope from the east side of Colvos Passage at an elevation of 240 feet. No photographs were possible due to the distance.

Fabulous first day back on San Juan Island after too many months away! In the afternoon, followed
J-pod
north from Eagle Point. Left the orcas at Lime Kiln about

3:45 pm
heading north, with J-1 and J-2 leading. Several small calves outperformed their elders in the multiple breaching category.
As I neared Lime Kiln, orca vocalizations blared loudly and clearly over the radio (FM 89.1). Detoured again. At around

7:20 pm
the J-pod trailers were going south off Hannah Heights.
San Juan Island is great!

Once again I spy whales (W. side San Juan Island) from the house as I talk with Ken Balcomb on the phone (OK, he spotted them first). Slowly moving North towards Henry Island.
