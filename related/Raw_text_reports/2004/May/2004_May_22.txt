Orca Sightings for May 22, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
My partner and I saw three to five whales (porpoises?) from the little mini park on First Street in Langley. We were lunching and could only make out the individual breathing sprays coming from a ways off toward Camano. They were headed south by southwest toward Clinton. Couldn't tell what sort of whale, as we were to far away. However, we could see quite a bit of blowing and activity in the water.

I noticed the Mosquito Fleet sitting in between Bells Beach and Camano watching one lone
gray
. Its about

9:35 AM
and looks like its heading southward.
