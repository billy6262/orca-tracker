Entry 1:
Yes,
J-pod

this morning
, headed north. My guests said they saw them also before

J-Pod
at Andrews Point/Smallpox Bay heading North at

2:30 PM
. Ruffles definitely stands out, even from a distance. About 13 members of J-Pod, no sign of the other 9, which are probably hanging back some.

The one thing
J's
are doing is spreading over a few miles of area and coming back together almost like a living thing. That is, expanding and contracting. I left them entering Andrews Bay going North just before
1600
this afternoon.
