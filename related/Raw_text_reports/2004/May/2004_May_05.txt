============================================================

Entry 1:
Just talked to Peter Hamilton of Lifeforce - he said the Park Manager at Pt. Roberts saw a pod of
40 - 50 orcas go north past Pt. Roberts
at
10 am
. J's were down off San Juan Island that day - anyone else hear rumors of a pod up north on Weds?

6:30
am, heading south; they spent most of the afternoon at the Hein Bank area, at

3:30
they were heading north past the Lime Kiln Lighthouse, to Andrews Bay; then turned around, at

6:30 pm
they were southbound working the tide rips.

...this afternoon we had the pleasure of observing J-Pod out near Hein Bank, in resting mode. Very neat to see all the whales so close together! We saw Speiden, Mike & family closer in near American Camp.
