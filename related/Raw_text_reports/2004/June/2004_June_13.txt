J pod
in Active Pass today (
3 p.m.
) just before they left it to cross the Strait of Georgia towards Fraser River. They say that when the whales leave the pass, they often start breaching like crazy - well, it turned out to be true today too- multiple breaches for about 10 minutes, including a few big ones by our old pal, Ruffles (J1). Also lots of tail lobbing and some spyhops.

J&L Pod
traveling together past the house at

10:00 AM
. They were in a very tight group and beautiful to see them together! Later, as they approached Henry Island, J Pod continued North while L Pod stayed in Open Bay. Then in the afternoon L Pod headed South along the west side of San Juan Island. Very spread out about 1 mile off shore. As the group approached False Bay, they got very active in their feeding, with lunges and porpoising. L-41, L-57 traveling fairly close together, with L-79 further out.
