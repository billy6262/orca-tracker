I saw
J-Pod
passing the Center for Whale Research, W. San Juan Island (this time heading towards my house), so I jumped in the car and zoomed over to San Juan County Park. Just in time to see the pod already porpoising by towards Lime Kiln. So I jump in the car again, zoom down to the lighthouse just as J-Pod rounded the corner. They were aways offshore, but it was a beautiful evening so I just sat and relaxed as they went by. Then into the car again to catch them at Eagle Cove, but they never arrived. Must have done the old West Side Shuffle! :)
