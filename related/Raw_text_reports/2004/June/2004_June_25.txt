J's

...the distinct calls of
J-Pod
coming out clearly on the hydrophone. The calls were as loud and clear as I've ever heard on our boat, and then J-Pod made a 90 degree turn and headed South out towards Middle Bank. As we listened & watched, we heard a literal symphony of calls near and far, and realized we were listening to
both J's & L's
! Later as the two pods approached, we saw multiple breaches, including a few dual whale breaches.
