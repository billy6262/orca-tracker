Orca Sightings for June 7, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J & L pods
in the waters off S. Vancouver Island heading toward San Juan Island & according to Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research "Still no K's and none of the L's seen off Tofino with K's on 17 May", which means there is still a tiny glimmer of hope that they could be off the west coast & will stop to pick up Luna before coming home. We did get a report from up off Queen Charlotte Island, but Orcalab ID'd them as the A36's.

We left
J Pod
about two miles south of Trial Island, headed east toward San Juan Island, at about

7:00 PM
.
L Pod
was a couple of miles behind them. I would think it will be a good day to see them off of San Juan Is. tuesday.
