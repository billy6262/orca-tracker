J-Pod
decided to give us yet another curve ball by altering what has been a somewhat regular pattern of coming down from Pt. Roberts and heading down Rosario/Bellingham Channel. Today they decided that Eastpoint/Boundary Pass was the way to go. They weren't in a big hurry until they started heading from Pender towards the Turn Point Lighthouse, where they picked up lots of speed. The action really got going as they passed from Stuart Island towards Henry Island. The whales began porpoising as they moved south. One whale went into a 9 breach cycle. We left the whales passing Lime Kiln heading in a southerly direction.
