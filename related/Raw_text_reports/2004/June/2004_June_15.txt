Orca Sightings for June 15, 2004
============================================================

Entry 1:
J-Pod all alone in a tightly bunched group slowly moving down Bellingham channel. It appeared that all 22 members where in the same tight group. No vocalizations. Just a slow and steady swim south along Cypress.
