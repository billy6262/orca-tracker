Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries called to say they'd been with the
Transient orcas
reported earlier in
Elliott Bay
, and had observed ~
12 Transients
. They left them at

3:15 pm
heading north from Kingston toward Point No Point, N. Kitsap Peninsula, closer to the Kitsap side. Whales id'd so far:
T90, T90b. T124, T124D and T124E
. We probably had about 10 whales total. I have a few ideas who was there, but want to double check when my brain is working a bit better. We never saw an adult male, but there were multiple reports of one in the group. Will let you know when I have them all figured out.

Orca Network received a call from NAS Whidbey Seaplane Base security - they had been with us during the Gray whale necropsy on the seaplane base beach earlier in the day, and this afternoon at

4:30 pm
they spotted a live
Gray whale
feeding and swimming in
Crescent Harbor
, near the deceased whale. They wondered if it knew there was one of their kin on the beach - and we wonder too~
