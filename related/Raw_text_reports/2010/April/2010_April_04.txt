Orca Sightings for April 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mary Lynn Lyke saw a spout of
a gray whale
in
Similk Bay
, north of Whidbey Island. Chris Foy saw
a gray
in
Similk Bay
, 50 yards from shore, slowly heading out of the bay.
*
A
gray whale
has stranded and died on a tidal flat in
Oakland Bay near Shelton
. Annie Douglas of Cascadia Research has inspected it. No word yet on cause of death or whether this is one that has been reported earlier.
*
Four Transients
were sighted just offshore of
Sooke Harbour
today at approx.

11:30am
. Brett, Danny and I spent almost 4 hours out there pounding through huge seas on ''Goldwing' but only came up with seeing a
dead juvenile Gray Whale
on the beach in Becher Bay (East Sooke Park). The animal looked very similar to the curious little Gray we had a few days ago in Enterprise Channel. Poor little guy.

For only the second time in my 14 years of living mostly in
West Seattle
, I finally got to spend a couple of hours watching
orcas
from the Lincoln Park beach!
Trileigh

I was walking along the beach about halfway between
Pt. Wells (Shoreline)
and Edmonds Washington yesterday at
3 PM
and saw
two orcas
swimming very close to shore. They appeared to be two females.

We were blessed by a passing
Orca
tonight at about

7:25pm
. We observed one possibly
two Orca's
traveling north in
Possession Sound
past the State Park. We watched it from our porch as it (they?) traveled along with a small fishing boat. It appeared to have a white spot on its back by the dorsal fin.

6 - 7 Orcas
off the east side of
Vashon Island
, south of Fauntleroy heading south fast. At

At

came by traveling from the NW to the SE feeding in the shallow water. It looks like one of the whales is #22, and when I get a chance I will try to ID the other two.
