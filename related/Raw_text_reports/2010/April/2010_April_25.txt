Orca Sightings for April 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:

3 orcas
in
Monterey Bay CA
(from a motel on Cannery Row) - 1 at
7 am
,
2 more at
8:30 am
.

This
[gray] whale
was feeding closely together with a second whale (both adult) in 6-10 ft of water from

11:30 to
6:00 pm
in a larger area off
Jetty Island / Snohomish estuary
. There was a third whale in their vicinity for all this time and a fourth joint just after noon to stay to the end of our sighting. All
four whales
moved into deeper water after
6 pm
and seemed to be diving and milling around between Jetty island and Gedney. There was a ton of plankton in the water - I went diving to see what they might be after. No visible sign of gauges in the sediment but my face was literally prickled with plankton, very poor visibility and I could hardly even see my view finder. Might be worth taking some water samples to see if there is any special development of plankton in the large estuarine area there... The whales definitely seem to like it there - feeding galore.... very stinky breaths....

Two gray whales
heading south from
Bells Beach
this evening

8:00-ish
. We heard them blowing and got to see some spines and then a tail in the air at one point-that was a thrill!

I have a second hand report from
Pt. Defiance
. One of the regulars from the boathouse (Bob) was fishing off the clay banks when
a grey
surfaced next to his boat. About 15ft away. The grey was very skinny.

off its stern.

Barry Alsos called to report
a Gray whale
in Samish Bay, from
3 - 5 pm
. The whale made 4 circular passes and came close to shore.
*
Is this Patch! If so, he's heading north into
Port Susan
about 30 yards off shore. He's being very lazy today - strolling real slow and laying on his back for most of time:)

7:05 am
hmm - never heard of a gray whale laying on its back unless it was being attacked by orcas or was floating dead - are you sure of this description?!

One gray
heading north through
Port Susan
at

1:30
He put on quite a show for all the spectators at
Tulalip Shores
. Rolling around and sticking his tail out of the water numerous times. He appeared to have a chunk out of his back fluke that was capped with a white mark.

4:15 gray whale
coming back through Tulalip Shores. Now heading south out of Port Susan. Rolling and eating.
