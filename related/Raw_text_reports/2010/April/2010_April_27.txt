============================================================

Entry 1:
My neighbor alerted me to a whale just north south of Strawberry point (
Saratoga Passage
) around

6:30pm
. We followed it with my camera until around 7 and thought you might enjoy some of the images.

We were treated to quite a show, this evening at
Mariners Cove, Oak Harbor
[beach theatre] with featured attraction,
one gray whale
. Putting on quite a display for all in attendence. First, seen spout was at
6PM
; 1/4 mile southwest of Mariners Cove, located, N.E. Whidbey Is. It was feeding time. Watched, from the shoreline, gray, feed on ghost/sand shrimp in estimated 6 to 8 feet max, of water. Two "gray whale lengths" [new navigation term] or 75 to 85 feet out from beach. It would spout, then spiral/twist onto its right side to feed. Once, on its side, you could see most of its body a couple of feet above water, with only head and spine as it tapers towards fluke/tail submerged. Half its fluke and entire flipper exposed. Then, it would reverse spiral to right itself, spout, and repeat, over and over. Feeding was laid back, without much commotion/swirling activity. Gray, slowly moved N.E. to right in front of Mariners Cove, constantly feeding. Several times in the shallows, gray would display its entire tail out of the water. Have only seen this when they dive. Never in shallow water. At one point, gray came within/less? than one "whale length" from shore with its head up. At Cove canal entrance, it turned and headed out to deeper water. Then, came back in to feed for awhile, in front of our house. At around

8:20PM
of this 2 hour twenty minute feature show, saw one last spout, then full fluke deep dive good bye. In mid channel heading south towards Camano's Rocky Point.

Judy Roupe called Orca Network about
a gray whale
passing
Pt. No Point
, Kitsap Peninsula, headed north about
10 AM
.
*
About

9:30 this AM
, I spotted
a lone gray
spout in front of the house as it moved rapidly northwest to
Mabana
. The tide was out a ways so the whale was diving deep off the drop off. It stopped to feed for a short while off the Mabana Road, but didn't linger.
