Orca Sightings for April 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Malleson and I did a survey of
Monterey Bay CA
today and found
600+ pacific white-sided dolphins
just south of Monterey Bay around
0900
. About three hours later we covered the same area and found
three transient killer whales
. These turned out to be
CA138
(confirmed by Nancy Black) and her juvenile
CA138A
and a brand new calf (
CA138B
). The whales had just made a kill and milled in the same area for about an hour before they ditched us in deteriorating weather conditions. We're not sure whether they killed a pinniped or small cetacean. We ended the encounter at1255.

More on the
T's
in
Strait of Juan de Fuca
: Heavy seas and rain made todays
1:00 trip a little challenging as we could not locate the
4 Transients
that Radar found this morning a few miles Southeast of Race Rocks. Brett and I spent close to 2.5 hours searching the area with 4 other boats with no success. Things changed for the better at
1530
hrs., when Russ Nicks from Sooke Coastal Explorations stumbled across the
T-30's
, 0.5 nm Southwest of the
Bedford Islands (Becher Bay)
. The four transients had just captured a large Sea Lion and were staying in the same area for over 45 minutes as they were having a late afternoon snack !!! As the animals circled around, we could see a large oil slick forming on the surface of the water and the gulls were gathering to pick up the scraps that were left behind. The T-30's have been hanging out in this area for a few days now, as they were seen the same day that the juvenile Gray Whale washed up at East Sooke Park. Our encounter ended at 1630 hrs., just 1.3 nm to the Southeast of the area where the dead Gray Whale was located (Aylard Farm).

Mary Bond of Seattle saw a whale that sounds like
a gray whale
from her description, at Meadow Point, N end of Golden Gardens Park in
Seattle
,

2:30-
3:00 pm
. She said it was rolling around in the shallows on it's back, and it had a clear dorsal ridge and flipper marks.

Beecher Bay
, at

3:30
today.

I snapped these photos today near the
southern tip of Camano
; just below our bank, I saw a fin come up out of the water, and lots of bubbling. I rushed for the camera, and snapped a couple more; looking at the first one, blowing it up, it almost
looks like an orca tussling with a grey
. The second two pics are obviously a grey, swimming away to the west-northwest towards Pebble Beach. There were two greys total. I read previous reports of an orca to the south of us swimming with greys, and I'm wondering if this is also one. If it was, we did not see it follow the two greys. Once the greys traveled NW from our home at the south end of Camano, we drove to
Pebble Beach
to watch them continue up Saratoga passage. The two greys came very close to the beach. Once they had traveled up towards Mabana,
a third whale followed,
feeding with a seal following it along. They were at Pebble at

10:00 am.
Peg Boley, Camano Island
The consensus is that the markings on the Photo of the Day are on a gray whale. -hg

I saw at least two
[gray] whales
spouting in the
Saratoga Passage, Bells Beach
, about

2:50
this afternoon. They swirled about and spouted several times. My guess is that they were feeding. Only saw a miniscule part of one of their spines. I believe they were headed south.

I saw a single
Gray whale
1/2 mile west of the
Keyport Naval
Base at
1015
. The whale was heading South between Bainbridge Island and the Kitsap Peninsula towards Brownsville. It's probably close to the Brownsville marina by this point.

Spotted maybe
a small grey
feeding off the green buoy at golden gardens park in
Seattle
this morning about
10am
. A few spouts and rising slightly above the surface every few minutes, staying in that area.

Jim Winship called in a report at
9 AM
of a
gray whale
at the entrance to
Oak Harbor Bay on Whidbey Island
, feeding in mudflats.
*
Pam Allen called Orca Network to report
a gray whale
moving back and forth near
Similk Bay
, north end of Skagit Bay, north of Whidbey Island.
*
My wife and I are new residents of
Poulsbo
. This morning from roughly

6:45am to
7:30
we saw about six spouts in Liberty Bay and the profile of a surfaced
[gray] whale
in the far distance. Too far to identify but the Kitsap newspaper says there have been gray whale sightings in the Bay over the past four days. I assume it's the same critter(s).
