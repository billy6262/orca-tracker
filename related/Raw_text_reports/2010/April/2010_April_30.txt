Orca Sightings for April 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod
came up Haro Strait past Lime Kiln Lighthouse in the mid afternoon. It was difficult to find the whales in the rough seas. Pictures are being sent to CWR for proof of presence. Some members of each of the J Pod family groups were seen, and babies and little kids seen and yes - Ruffles J1 (see above photo) and Granny J2. Blog post from that day: 'Checking in at the Light.'

Making our way across the Strait of Georgia this morning, our ace whale spotter - Captain John - spotted blows in the vicinity of Deltaport and the Roberts Bank Coal terminal at

11:30
. As we have all been waiting anxiously for J Pod to arrive, we thought it might be them, however, it turned out to be a very active group of
7 Transients
. The group included
T99, T99A, T99B, T65A, T65A2
plus two other un-Id'ed youngsters (T65A3??), ??? The youngsters were very playful, with tail slaps, rolling around, lots of partial breaches, and several full forward breaches. Unfortunately, no vocals were detected on the hydrophone. No hunting was observed, although the group did several full changes of direction, and overall, seemed to be circling their way northbound through the Strait.

I was heading west under the
Agate Pass [Bainbridge Island]
Bridge in my boat, and lo and behold
a gray whale
comes toward me just 50 yards in front of me. He or she was by himself heading east against the current. This was approximately

4:30
in the afternoon.
Update:
I notified you that I saw a Gray Whale underneath the Agate Pass bridge on
April 30th around
4:30pm. After coming home and researching different whale possibilities within Puget Sound, I realized that I was wrong. It wasn't a gray and it wasn't an orca or a humpback. I don't believe it was a minke, because it seemed wider than a minke, more bulk. So I am not sure what it was. It had a small fin, it was dark gray, it was bulkier than minke's I've seen before and it was about the size of my boat which is 22 feet long.
