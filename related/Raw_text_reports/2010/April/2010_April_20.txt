Orca Sightings for April 20, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mouth of
Quillayute River
,
single male orca
just beyond the end of the navigational jetty. The whale was sitting relatively motionless in 25 ft of water in one of the narrowest parts of the river's mouth. We presume it was hunting seals and/or sea lions, due to their abundance in the estuary. We were working from a small boat and as we turned the boat around to re-enter the river, a large dorsal fin rose about 3-4' up out of the water less than 20' behind our boat. As we continued up the river we saw the dorsal break the surface one additional time in the same location. It was late afternoon (
~
4:30 pm
) approaching high tide.

Soon we had a confirmed sighting of
transients
in the area we expected and headed south towards
Partridge
. And then the waiting began. Transients can dive for up to 5-7 minutes and we waited - and waited - and waited. And then a burst of excitement from the passengers as they spotted one dorsal fin. And another, and another. We had found
6 transients
, and they were in no hurry to go anywhere, as they meandered this way and that. As we got a bit closer, we were able to identify the whales as one we have been seeing a lot of lately-
T87
and family. T87 is a big male with a very distinctive square cut notch on his dorsal fin. Soon two juvenile transients got a little playful and began to roll on each other and slap the water with their tails.

Brad Hanson and Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC in Seattle were with a pod of
Transient orcas
in
Puget Sound
today. They found them at

12:25
heading up into Rich Passage. They went from Rich Passage up through Port Orchard to Agate Pass, then turned around and headed back south. At
3:30 pm they were back out in the middle of Puget Sound, west of Elliott Bay and headed south, then turned around and headed NE.

I saw a pod of
orcas
today at

12:45
in Rich Passage at south side of
Bainbridge Island
- they were heading west toward Bremerton. It looked like there were 5 or 6 of them of various sizes, at least one male.
