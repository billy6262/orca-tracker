Orca Sightings for April 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The 12.15 pm Ocean Magic was out in all sorts of interesting weather this afternoon. Mika on board suddenly saw a dorsal fin at
Discovery and Chatham Islands
. It wasn't just one big dorsal fin of a male
Orca
, who appeared to be
T87
, but another smaller one popped up, a female, who possibly might be
T88
, based on the saddle patch. Perhaps others out there might know for sure. At first I thought it looked like T20 and T21, but T87's notch at the top end of his dorsal fin is much larger, so the consensus was T87.

We found
gray whale #383
swimming closely with
another
, SE of
Gedney Island
around
10am
. The pair were then joined by
a third whale
who seemed a little on the thin side--looked to me like it had some hollowing behind the blow hole. Stayed with the three of them for close to an hour, during which time we also saw two or three other grays blowing in the distance. Just as we were about to leave, with #383 and company heading off to the SE toward Everett,
Patch
surfaced near us coming from the other direction!

Saw another solo adult
grey feeding
in
Elger Bay
around

7:00
last night. Several impressive blows this time. He motored off heading toward the south end of the island just before
7:30.

I was working out in the yard along the bluff this afternoon about

4:20 PM
when I heard the familiar "whoosh". The tide was in and a single gray came by close to shore. He was traveling fairly fast until got just south of Mabana Road (
SW Camano Island
), then stopped to feed.

At

2:15 PM
, I was flying towards Everett and spotted
two gray whales
feeding by the big marine marker west of
Everett
. The second sighting was again flying near Everett at 5 PM and watching 3 gray whales feeding off of Jetty Island (NW of Everett). I was not able to ID the whales. I've noticed since the last orca attacks we've had very little feeding activity in the Langley area. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the orcas or if the whales have just moved on?

We had
a Gray whale
feeding from the
Pt No Pt
Lighthouse towards Hansville store this morning. Left the area about
10am
, heading west.
