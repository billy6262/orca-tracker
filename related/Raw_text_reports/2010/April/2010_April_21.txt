About
7 PM, 2 grays
passed by (
SW Camano Island
) heading northwest. The tide was fairly low, so they were out a ways. They stopped for a leisurely late dinner off the spit at Mabana Road. Lots of of spouts and rolling, with only occasional pec fins. Beautiful calm sunny evening so great visibility, but too far away for photos.

Tim Johnson and I saw
one gray whale
feeding off of Indian Island in
