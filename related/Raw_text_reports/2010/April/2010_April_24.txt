============================================================

Entry 1:
Ron Hirschi of Marrowstone Island called to report
3 Dall's porpoise
off
Marrowstone Island

Orca Network received a report of
one Gray whale
heading north in mid-
Saratoga Passage
between Madrona, Camano Island, and Coupeville, Whidbey Island at

4:15 pm
.
*
Ann Casey, Carol Plunkett and Ann Moeller saw

2:30 pm
.

About

3:15 PM
, while hiking Lawson bluff on
Sucia Island
, [NW of Orcas Island] friends and I sighted two distinct groups of
Orcas
. They were traveling southwest from the direction of Alden Bank about a third of the way offshore from Patos Island. The 1st group was composed of about three females followed by another group of 3 to 4 females with possibly a juvenile and following them was a large male with one or two females. The 2nd group was about a mile behind them. They also were broken up into 3 groups with about 3 females, followed by four females and then a really large male with a female and it appeared to have a much smaller orca between or right next to them. They were traveling steadily and didn't appear to be feeding. We watched them with a monocular until they disappeared from sight . They were going in the direction of Boundary Pass.

The
Orca
whales are right out across from us off the east point of
Speiden
at
7pm
. We are no experts but it looks as if it was just 1 Orca with a calf as far as we could tell from here. They headed off to Orcas and Yellow island.
Report forwarded by Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island
*
Horace, a Beam Reach student, called in a report of
12 - 16 unidentified orcas
, including 1 male, between
Jones Island and San Juan Island
at

6:30 pm
.

A lone
[gray] whale
off the northern beach of
Marrowstone Island
. I spotted the lone whale on the eastern side of the north beach at about

1:40
and continued to observe it for 35 minutes as it slowly traversed the entire northern side of the island traveling from east to west. On a subsequent flight I observed it an hour later going the opposite direction almost to the northeastern corner by the light house. The attached pictures show how close to shore it was. It kept this distance the entire length of the island without stopping accept once when it stopped in even shallower water for about about 5 minutes. I presumed it was feeding during that period.

At about

1:30 PM
I spotted a lone whale, likely a
gray
, off of East Beach on
Marrowstone Island
. It swam slowly and parallel to the beach, maybe 100 yards of shore, heading north. I easily walked along and kept up with it. Fantastic.

I'm doing some naturalist work for Victoria Clipper this season, and we went out today looking for
grays
en route to Coupeville. We saw
#383
and another whale surfacing and diving together just west of the
Possession Point
buoy between
10-11 am
. We ran into another pair off the mouth of
Penn Cove
around
noon
(one of whom
*
might
*
have been Patch but I couldn't get a positive ID), and as we left Coupeville at

2:30
saw yet another blowing along the north shore of Penn Cove. We saw "Dubknuck" a little SE of
Gedney Island
. There were a
couple other grays
blowing in the distance, one toward the
Tulalip Reservation
and one way over south of the
Everett waterfront
.
