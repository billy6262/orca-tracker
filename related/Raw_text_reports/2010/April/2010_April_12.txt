Gray whale

Orcas
(we think it was one male and two or three females) were spotted around

3:00 PM
in
Penn Cove
, Coupeville, WA, on the east side of Whidbey Island.

1 Gray whale
in
Sinclair Inlet
off Ross Point, traveling all directions. Generally heading east out of inlet, stopped at Ross Point and turned around, headed north towards Navy side of inlet, @

3:30pm -
4:00pm
, presumably foraging.

1:30 pm
- Glanced up from the lunch table to see a smaller whale watch boat stopped in front of the house. They were watching
a lone gray
spouting and diving deep off the drop-off in front of the house (
Mabana
, SW Camano Isl). The whale was heading north on several dives, then the boat abruptly turned and headed south, and I lost track of the whale.

Two gray whales
were present in
Boundary Bay
on the Fraser River delta this
afternoon

Kirby and Jan Mitchell called to report
several Gray whales
just north of
Pebble Beach
, S. Camano Island at

12:35 pm
.
*
Erick Peirson reported a
Gray whale
north of the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lane
, first heading north, then south at about
noon
. Another boat was with 3 other Grays off S. Gedney (including Patch!). At
12:15 he found another Gray whale between East Pt. Whidbey Island and S. Camano Island.
*
Jenny Manning of the Whidbey News Times reported they saw
a Gray whale
half way between
Skagit Bay and Polnell Pt
. at

10:30 am
.
*
Andrew Beckett called to report
11 - 15 orcas
off Skiff Pt,
Bainbridge Island
, heading south toward Yeomalt Pt. at
6 pm
.
*
We spotted what appeared to be
four Orcas
in mid-channel of
Port Susan
off Tulalip Shores around

4:30 PM
. We watched two animals traveling north, together, porpoising repeatedly and quickly, then diving for several minutes at a time. They also seemed to stop, circle along the top of the water for a few minutes, then continue their northward travel. After perhaps five minutes watching them, we noticed a third and fourth animal that seemed to be herding anything in the vicinity back toward the two we first spotted. The distance only increased while we watched, as the group neared the cliff north of Spee-bi-dah. They then reversed direction, and headed south where we watched them repeat the porpoising, then diving behavior. None ever breached the surface to show us their whole body, but they appeared significantly larger than Dall's porpoises that we have previously seen. We wondered if this was part of the infamous gang that may have attacked Patch, as previously reported. We will watch for other reports to see if we get any further confirmation of what type of cetaceans we have been observing.

So apparently while I was hard at work my boyfriend saw the
Orcas
in front of our house again (
Penn Cove, Whidbey Isl
). Looks like 3 or four. He took a couple of great pictures. This was around

3:30 PM
today He said they were really slapping around for some time before leaving the cove.

There is a group of
orcas
hanging out in
Penn Cove
right now (

3:20 pm
). Looks like one big male, 2-3 smaller whales and a baby.

I had read about the Orca sightings in
Penn Cove
but this time got to see them myself. About
6 or 7 Orcas
including one very large older one and two young Orcas. They were feeding 150 yds off Monroe Landing and I at last got to see them from my deck, (although I had to stand on the picnic table for the best view).

Just happened to look out the window at

6:50 am
to see
orcas
going by! Off
Hidden Beach
, Greenbank, heading N up Saratoga Passage. 1 male, 3 - 5 females, one with a calf. The mom/calf pair stopped & turned south for a bit, then circled & splashed, probably hunting a seal. By
7:05 they all turned S, heading toward the entrance to Holmes Harbor.

Wanted to report a Whale who has been visiting/feeding. Appx

12:15PM
just West of the West Beach of
Sinclair Inlet
here in Bremerton. This time the whale traveled South and I didn't see it pass back by. I caught just a few of the sprays on my camera.

From Matt's photos, we can confirm this whale was
a Gray whale
