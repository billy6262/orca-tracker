Mid
afternoon
through evening -Rolling Bay,
Bainbridge Island
. Just one whale with several scars. Came very close to shore in shallow water and came within a few feet of our dock. There must have been a huge bait ball of fish at the shelf at the edge of Rolling Bay, huge number of Sea Gull's were bunched up and diving into the water. The Whale (
Gray whale
, from photos submitted) was in the bay most of the
afternoon
.

I was on a Deception Pass tour boat out of
Cornet Bay
, Whidbey Island. Three other tour boats were also watching the
orcas
so this may be a redundant report. There were approximately
four-six orcas
, seen at

1:30 pm
, apparently feeding, the tour boat operator thought on a sea lion killed earlier. The male has a chunk missing near the top of his dorsal fin (that would be T87). The tour boat operator said they were
transients
.

This afternoon from about

1:15-
2:00
we had about
six transients
feeding on a Steller sea lion half a mile south of Bird Rocks in
Rosario Strait
. Included in the group were
T87 and T88
, and they were all doing lots of circling with the sea lion (or remnants thereof) visible at the surface or in the mouths of the whales on several occasions. Many gulls were following the whales and taking advantage of feeding on scraps near the surface. In addition to the large male T87, there was another male by himself quite a ways off that I heard was later identified as
T14
. The setting was perfect, with the whales surfacing in front of Mt. Baker in the background.

I was on Capt. Jim Maya's boat on Saturday
afternoon
to see the transients who had been at Bird Rocks in
Rosario Strait
most of the morning. As we arrived Pender T-14 had left the group and was heading off by himself. The whales were feeding on a Steller sea lion and were in the same location. My photos revealed that there were
7 transients
in the group. I have sent the pictures to the Center for Whale Research for verification. In the meantime this is who I believe I saw.
T87, T88, T90, T90B, T124, T124D and T124E
(ID's confirmed by CWR). I posted some images on my blog from the day.

I live on Whidbey Island overlooking the S
aratoga Passage north of Langley
, just south of Bells Beach. This morning at

8:15 am
I was using binoculars to look for grays. Instead about a half-mile out from the bluff I saw 2 or 3 animals heading north in the passage. They were swimming directly north, not stopping or deviating from their line. All I could see was intermittent surfacing dorsal fins sliding through the water. There were at least 2 going side by side and appearing one after another, but I think there were actually 3 of them. I was only able to track them visually for a couple hundred yards before I lost sight of them. If I had to guess I would say they were
orcas
because of the formation and way they were swimming, and the dorsal fins. Approximate Lat/Long values where I first saw them: 48.06006, -122.44345 Thanks,
Harry West
I would guess these were some of the Transient orcas that have been around - possibly the ones that were reported (above) in Rosario Strait Saturday afternoon, and again in Saratoga Passage on Sunday. sb

We got back to
Camano
about

12:30PM
today after an overnight in Seattle. Feeling relieved to back on the island, I walked over to the window, thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice to be welcomed home by a whale", when unbelievably, there was a flash of the back and tail of a
lone gray whale
!! It was out from shore a ways and I watched several spouts as it slowly moved south.
