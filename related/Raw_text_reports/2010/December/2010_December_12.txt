Orca Sightings for December 12, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Nov. 12 - 13 - Carrie Newell, Mark Malleson, and Ken Balcomb went whalewatching with Richard Ternullo of
Monterey Bay
Whale Watch on 12 November during the American Cetacean Society meeting that was held at Seaside, CA. Everyone on board was, of course, hoping that we would see killer whales. It took awhile, but we found some when the breeze died down offshore in the early afternoon. Alisa Schulman-Janiger was aboard and instantly recognized the
four killer whales
we saw off
Santa Cruz
as CA216 and her three offspring CA217, CA218, and CA219. The whales headed steadily in an east southeasterly direction along the north edge of the
Monterey Canyon
, looking as though they were foraging, but that we saw no kills. There were many California sea lions in the vicinity, some of which fled in advance of the whales, but they did not chase them.
These same
transient type killer whales
were also seen in the same vicinity on 13 November by Ken Stagnaro, owner of Santa Cruz Whale Watching.
