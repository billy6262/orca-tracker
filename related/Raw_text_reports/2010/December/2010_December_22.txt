Orca Sightings for December 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had an encounter with the
T30's with T124C
in the afternoon heading east off
Victoria's
waterfront. I left them at

4:20
south of Discovery Island east bound for Middle Bank. T124C and T30A spent the entire time together while T30, T30B, and T30C were well ahead and offshore.
