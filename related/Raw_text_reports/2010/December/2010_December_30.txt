Orca Sightings for December 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I found a group of 6-8 elusive
Transients
near Crescent Bay (west of
Port Angeles
) in the
afternoon
. They were originally traveling east in two groups with a single female well in the lead. There were no obvious males seen and a newer calf with its mother slightly north of the inshore group. They eventually grouped up and turned to the north west back towards Vancouver Island. I left them at 1450 hrs mid strait south of Sooke west bound with the ebb current. IDs to be determined.
