Orca Sightings for December 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gray whale(s)
off
Neskowin, OR
- same area where the dead baby whale was in September (45.10694; -123.98306). From the camera angle, the whale(s) were moving generally south.

Here's a little more from the
L pod
encounter: I accompanied Ivan Reiff aboard Western Explorer after he spotted whales near
Hein bank
from shore. We found them around
1310
just south south of Hein Bank. The whales were very spread out over many miles in singles and small groups heading westerly at a slow to medium pace. While it was impossible to find everyone in the time we were there, we did see pieces to all the parts of L pod including all of the youngest calves.
The big news from the day is that we were able to document a new calf! And while we were all thrilled to see the new calf, we were a little confused by the potential mother. The calf, which looked young and still lumpy (L116 has fattened up nicely), was stuck closest to L5 for short time we were with them although we also saw L54 and L90 (both potential mothers) near the pair. L72, L105, L108, and L84 also briefly traveled as part of that group before fanning back out again. L5 has not had a calf (that we are aware of) since 1986 so, personally, I'm skeptical that this is really her calf. She may be helping out the real mom by babysitting or something in the calf's early days. We have seen this on several occasions over the last 20 years where a supposedly post-reproductive female was traveling with a newborn calf in the fall that ended up being someone else's kid. Each one of these involved a first time mother (L51 and L84/L5 in 1990, L67 and L98/K18 in 1999, and L72 and L105/L27 in 2004) so it makes me wonder if L90 isn't really the mom. Or it could be L54's third calf as the new calf's right eyepatch looks very similar to L108's. Or it could really be L5's calf. We will go ahead and call this calf L117 but more encounters will be needed to confirm the mother. We will keep you posted so be patient and keep your eyes on the water.
We got photos of
L5, L25, L41, L47, L54, L55, L72, L77, L78, L82, L83, L84, L85, L86, L90, L91, L92, L94, L100, L105, L106, L108, L110, L112, L113, L115, L116
, and the new calf. Jeanne can also add, at least,
L79 and L88
to that list.

L Pod
west of
Hein Bank
, and two sets of
Transients
(see report below for more on Transients). We spent our time with L Pod. We think most of them were there. Ivan and Dave Ellifrit were on Western Explorer and Jeanne Hyde was with me on the Peregrine. We think we saw members of most of the L sub groups. This is the third day in Dec. that we have had Residents.

My original sighting (
10 am
) was from shore (at
South Beach, San Juan Island
) from about 5 miles. The whales actually turned out to be
L-Pod
(probably all of them). They were spread out over 4-6 miles heading towards Race Rocks.

Jim Maya emailed and John Boyd called to make sure we had heard
orcas
were found at
Hein Bank
today. Earlier reports from shore were they may be Transients, but later reports confirmed the whales as L pod at Hein Bank.

The
T11's and T49A's
skulked west along the shoreline of Oak Bay and
Victoria
's waterfront today. I left them at
1445
west bound in Race Passage.

Two sets of
Transients
this morning, one set near James Island heading up
Rosario St
. and another set off the
Victoria
waterfront.

We are heading south in the King County Research Vessel Liberty and just spotted a
whale
in outer Elliot bay. The time was approx.

8:45 am
. The position was in the shipping lanes, just north of the Bainbridge -Seattle ferry route. It appeared to possibly be a solo
Minke or Gray whale
heading south. It's body was sleek and smooth. We did not see the small dorsal fin typical of a Minke, yet it seemed smaller than a typical Gray whale. It surfaced a few times as we passed it, each time we saw a low sleek whale and its spout. We did not get pictures. Hope this helps.
