Orca Sightings for December 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

2:30pm
I had the good fortune of seeing
at least three orca
off the fishing pier at the
Edmonds
marina. The orca were about 400 yards off the fishing pier just north of the ferry dock when I first spotted them. They swam northwest towards Whidbey Island as I was photographing them. If you look closely, you can see a seal (or sea lion) behind the orca's fin.

A ferry employee called at

9:15
this morning from the Bremerton route to report orcas in
Rich Passage
near Waterman, headed east toward Seattle.
*
Saw two
Orcas
in the west end of
Rich Passage
this morning at

9:15am
. They were heading out towards
Seattle
traveling fairly fast. Did not get a chance to get a good ID as they were only on the surface for a short time.

We sent Kevin and Doug Miller's (see report below) photos to the Center for Whale Research, and Dave Ellifrit replies "the whale with the two nicks looks like T137A to me."
