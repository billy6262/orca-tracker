Today around
1100-1130
, I saw a group of
3-4 female orcas
feeding on a seal that they had caught. They were in an inlet of water by
Keyport
.

I just got a phone call from someone who lives at Enetai (near
Bremerton
across from Bainbridge Island). Ruth Reese said the [
orcas
] apparently came through
Rich Passage
, where two people she knows saw them near Point Heron between
8 and
8:30
. They continued north, and the Keyport sighting fits with this.
