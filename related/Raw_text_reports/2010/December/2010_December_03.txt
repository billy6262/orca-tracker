Orca Sightings for December 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was at
Point Defiance
and saw what may have been a
Minke
around 300 yards offshore between Owen Beach and the boathouse. I only got two quick glimpses of it, one I saw a dorsal as it was going into the water.
