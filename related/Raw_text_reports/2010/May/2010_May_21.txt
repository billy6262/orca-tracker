Orca Sightings for May 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
noon
I was on the 5 mile drive in
Pt. Defiance Park
and saw a tree/root wad floating through the narrows. It looked like the head/neck nessie photo. While looking at it through the binoculars I saw at least
2 harbor Porpises
near the entrance to
Gig Harbor
.

We spotted a
Gray Whale
at
Hein Bank
at about
11am
(from the photo we'd say this is Gray whale #53, one of the "regular" Saratoga Passage whales!). This was the first time I had seen a Gray Whale at Hein Bank. We watched the Gray Whale for a while before heading north and heard later that the whale had traveled towards Eastern Bank.

At around

7:40 AM
we saw a single
gray whale
directly off Picnic Point in
Edmonds
. We saw two blows, then the whale dove; we think it was feeding. Several minutes later we saw two more blows a few hundred yards to the north, still near shore, and then it dove again. We saw a final spout much further from shore to the north as it headed toward Mukilteo.

Gray whale #53
off
Eastern Bank
, 3.5 miles west of Smith Island at

2:25 pm
, doing long dives right off the bank.
