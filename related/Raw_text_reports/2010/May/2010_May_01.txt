Orca Sightings for May 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Western Prince joined up with
J Pod
at approximately

1:20 p.m
. They were headed south in Rosario Strait. We were able to parallel
J-14
, and
J-30
and the rest of the sub pod for about an hour! It was absolutely spectacular to be back on the water with the Southern Residents today! They were mostly traveling, but there was an occasional stop for foraging and a few tail slaps. I did see a few breaches in the distance, likely from other J Pod whales. We left them about

2:45 p.m
. as they were headed around the south tip of Lopez Island.

J Pod
about 1 mile off
Deception Island

2:23pm
. They are spread out all the way across Rosario Strait.

We were with
J pod
off of
Iceberg Point
, moving west very slowly fighting the flood (incoming) tide. I felt great to be watching a group of whales I have been with for 23 year. I could almost read their thoughts and motives for what they were doing. There was a three to four foot chop. The whales would break through the crest of a wave and plow through the next.

Five Transient Killer Whales
were spotted off of
Sooke Harbour
this morning! By the time Brett and I got out on our
2:30 trip, the five Transients were well into
Haro Strait
headed for San Juan Island. Our encounter with Captain Hook (T-40) and four other females started at

4:15
pm, just over half a mile to the Northeast of
Kelp Reef
. The five Transients were grouped together doing long dives as they swam to the North. For approximately 20 minutes, we paralleled these animals from quite a distance when all of a sudden, T-40 and company did a 180 degree turn and increased their speed! Within minutes, we noticed a large Steller Sea Lion was thrashing around in between the five whales. For the next hour we watched the five Transients batter and ram the Steller Sea Lion into oblivion. During the course of our stay, we saw many high speed lunges, breaches, dolphin leaps and tail lobs. Captain Hook seemed to stay on the outskirts while the four females did most of the work on the Sea Lion. (Very similar to how a pride of Lions work !!) Our encounter with the whales ended just after

5:20 pm
at which point the Steller Sea Lion was still alive but badly beaten up.

I went out with Maya's Westside Charters toward the south end of San Juan Island to hopefully meet J Pod, who was traveling down Rosario Strait. On our way we got word that
5 transients
were closer to our location, so we changed course and headed for them. T40 and who appeared to be 3 females and an juvenile, (just confirmed by Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research as
T071, T071A, T071B and T071C
) were beginning to head north up Haro Strait, zigzagging their way back and forth across the strait as they continued north. Their dives were approximately 5+ minutes in length. Then they changed direction back to the south and with the next surfacing we could tell they had found some prey, a Steller sea lion- blog post from that encounter: 'Capt Hook is in Town!'

We heard a report this morning that
5 Orcas
had been seen near
Sooke
heading East at around
8.30am.
Despite a thorough search of the area in cooperation with another boat, we were unable to find the Orcas. However, as we headed out in the afternoon we reminded all the boats heading out to be on the lookout for these Transients and sure enough they were spotted near
Discovery Island
, just off Seabird Point! As we arrived on scene we immediately identified Cpt. Hook (
T40
), along with four females. We followed the Orcas as they crisscrossed up Haro Strait, obviously in hunting mode. In fact near the end of our trip we did see them make a kill! The Orcas were a little South East of Kelp Reef when we left them.

As we head south I find out that there are
Transient Orcas
over near
Victoria
headed our way. Much closer than the Js so we head over there. We find
T40
, "Capt. Hook" and family heading lazily north, zigzagging back and forth, looking for prey. As they get close to
Kelp Reef
, the water explodes and we know that they are after a sea lion. This continues for over an hour and a half. Right after we left, they killed it and ate it.

I saw whale spouts in the water off of
Pt. No Point WA
--between the Point and Hansville this afternoon. I saw at least 3 or 4 spouts and the back of one whale (probably a
gray
) between

4:40 and 6 P.M.
We have seen almost daily evidence of whales in this same area off and on since earlier this week.

April 27 -

Entry 2:
Point No Point and Hansville WA.
Last Tuesday,
April 27th, then yesterday,
April 30th and today,

Entry 3:
a lone gray whale
has been feeding up and down Skunk Bay about 2 miles north of the Hansville store (N. Kitsap Peninsula). It's been showing up around

8:30
and working the sandy part of the shore beyond the rocks while the tide is going out. I'd say at times it's no more than 30 or 40 feet offshore. The whale looks to be about 30 feet in length. It seems to be very slowly feeding his way north to the end of skunk bay, then turns and heads back south along the shoreline. It'll spout once or twice then turn on its side and do circles exposing its fins and tail(?). This all occurs over about 4 to 5 hours. I'll attach some shots I took from our place about midway low bank in Skunk Bay.
