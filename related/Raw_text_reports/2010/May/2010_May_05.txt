Orca Sightings for May 5, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mariners Cove
Sighting. N.E. Whidbey around

6:45PM
, was on patio when I noticed some movement in the water with lots of birds nearby. Wasn't sure it was a
gray
, but, few minutes later came a spout. It was a couple hours after low tide and gray seemed to be somewhat lackadaisical. Ever slowly meandering N.E.; submerging itself but appeared not to be feeding much or at all. Searching or checking things out to come back to when higher tide? Along the way, gray did have enough energy to launch its entire head out of the water. At Mariners Cove marina entrance, gray turned sharp right and headed out to deeper water. Last spout/fluke seen meandering, east; towards Brown Point, at north end of Camano Island, near Stanwood.

My husband, Kevin, and I are sitting here puzzling over a strange sighting he had directly south of the
Lopez Ferry terminal
. He watched it from

8:15am-
9:15am
. It was about
8 feet long, dark gray
, with a thick muscular tail stock, swept back dorsal fin and distinct, short beak. For most of the time he was watching it, it was playing with or unsuccessfully trying to eat a salmon. We looked at several guides and the closest that he could come up with was a
bottlenosed dolphin, which seems nearly impossible
. The catch seems to be the distinct beak.

I have a couple of photos of the
grey whale
as it was coming out of False Creek into English Bay,
Vancouver
today (about
1430
). How often do we get to see a grey whale with Lighthouse Park in the background!?

According to a CKNW newsflash
a Gray
has been sighted in
False Creek
, which is pretty much right downtown
Vancouver
by Granville Island, between the 2 Bridges there, the Burrard and Granville St Bridge. Let's hope its ok because the last time one got into this area, it beached and died.

I saw
a Gray whale spout
in
Saratoga Passage
! First spout was at

10:48 am
, just north of Pebble Beach, SW Camano Island. At
10:52 am I saw it spout quite a bit further to the north, so it looked like it was traveling rather than feeding.
