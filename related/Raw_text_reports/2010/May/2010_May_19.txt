The ship's captain announced that it was passing at the bow of the ferry and waited for it to pass. It surfaced a few times; blowing as it headed south.

This morning the
7am Clinton ferry
delayed its departure for 7 minutes to allow a
gray whale
to pass across its path from north to south. Quite a show for everybody aboard.
