Orca Sightings for May 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call around
noon
from Sharon Soderberg of the
Point No Point resort near Sooke, B.C.
, reporting
a dead orca calf
washed up on their beach. She sent a photo to us, which shows a newborn calf, fetal folds still visible. Sharon said it was approximately 8.5' long, and the umbilical cord was still attached.
The Dept. of Fisheries Marine Mammal Stranding Network responded, and a necropsy was performed under the direction of Canada's DFO. We have had a number of Transient orcas in the area, but J pod had also been in the region just days before the stranding, so it isn't yet known who the calf belonged to. We will forward on any further information on this as it becomes available.

2 whales (
orcas
) reported again in
Port Angles
at
1000
. No Ids yet but one of the photos from yesterday looked like T40.

3
(one big one and 2 little
orcas
) and possibly a 4th (? - none of us were really sure but we thought so) Orca were in
Port Angeles
harbour again today.

This
afternoon
we encountered a
Humpback Whale
just south of the Chain Islets! This was the first Humpback Whale that had been sighted in the Salish Sea this year and it was very exciting as we sat and watched this large baleen whale feed. The Humpback Whale was doing large loops off
Oak Bay Flats
, near Victoria, whilst we sat and observed and had not moved very far when we had to finally leave and head home.

Ron Bates of the Marine Mammal Research Group in Victoria called to report a
Humpback whale
sighted off
Victoria
- it was 1.5 miles south of Oak Bay, heading west at

3:45 pm
.

While watching a beautiful sunset rainbow at

8:15pm
tonight I saw a solitary
grey whale
mid channel off of
Langley
heading up Saratoga Passage. Just now at

10:45pm
I hear a solitary whale feeding in front of our house here in Langley. It is very calm and the whale is very loud. Cool. No ID since it is dark. Still feeding at 11pm and moving very slowly. All whale pits were erased by yesterday's wind and waves.

Glanced out at
Noon
just in time to see a single
gray whale
spout several times just south of Mabana Road (
SW Camano Island
). It was diving deep off the drop-off, and seemed to be heading north fairly rapidly.
Barbara Brock, Camano Island
