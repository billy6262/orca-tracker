Orca Sightings for May 13, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spotted what we think was a
minke
whale at Salt Creek Rec Area by
Port Angeles
around
6pm
while surfing.

I was kayaking near the rocks at tongue point, 150ft from shore near salt creek state park outside Port Angeles at about
5PM
. Saw dark gray/light black whale circulating and surfacing repeatedly in the same area. Sort of looked like an extremely robust and large dolphin. Dorsal fin was curved back like a scythe. Head had a thick short nose, dolphin like but chunkier. Animal was at least 10ft long, may have been 15ft. I went home and
pilot whale
seemed to be the correct ID. May have been two because there seemed to be some size differences but that may just be a false impression since I didn't see two separate animals. Animal kept getting closer and closer to me, so I decided to move off, but we continued to see him break the surface just past the waves. Never seen this type of whale at salt creek but may have seen one on the outside of dungeness spit a couple of years ago.

Orca Network received a report from Cindy Burns, wildlife biologist for the Siuslaw Natl. Forest,
Florence, OR
, of
~4 orcas
going up the Siuslaw River from

1:30 - 3 pm
. They were observed breaching by the crab dock 1/2 mile upriver.
I took a look at the photos and whales are the
T49As and T49Bs
.

Bittersweet news from
Possession Point State Park
(S. Whidbey Isl): Last
night
we witnessed nature at work; a small pod of
Orcas
attack and eat our resident seal pup. We are happy the whales have full bellies, but we mourn the loss of our dear friend 'Sammy the Seal'.

Right around dusk (

8:40
), my husband and I saw
4-5 Orcas
, one much smaller than the others, heading north between
Polnell Point and Strawberry Point on Whidbey Island
. We were too far away to see details, and didn't have a camera with a zoom close at hand.

I would say
K's and L's
for sure. Lots of socialization behaviour off of Cape Mudge. Multiple breaches, spyhops and tail lobs!! Absolutely beautiful to see these guys every year. Will try and forward some photos when I get back to Tofino.

I have a fifth hand report that there may be
K and L
whales in that sighting, but I think Ron Bates or Mark Malleson have second or third hand reports that may be more precise.

Just got a report (~
5 pm
), through Simon (Ocean Ecoventures), that LOTS of
Orcas
are headed south from
Campbell River B.C.
today. Last year we had a similar report and 18 hours later Residents came down through Active Pass!

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called to report the pod of
Transient orcas
off Dilworth,
NE Vashon Island
at

6:15 pm
, heading south.
*
Donna Sandstrom called to report the pod of
Transient
orcas approaching the
Vashon ferry lanes
at

5:50 pm
, heading south. It appeared there were ~6 orcas.
*
We saw the
orcas
between
Elliott Bay and Bainbridge
on the

3:45
ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge.

KING5 TV in Seattle showed this beautiful video footage of
6 orcas
traveling in a resting line off
Edmonds
at about

12:50 pm
today, heading south. On their website, they also show some great still photos taken by several people who watched them off Edmonds and off Mukilteo. In photo #5, a male with a large fin and a nick out of the top looks to us like
Transient orca T87
- a male had not been reported in other reports, and the video didn't show the saddle patches well enough for ID's, so this was a very helpful photo!
*
This morning at approximately

7:00 am
while just sitting to enjoy a cup of morning coffee there was a
very large pod of Orcas
between my house at the south tip of
Camano Island and Langley
in Saratoga Passage. They were slapping their tails and swimming by very slowly. They were heading towards Port Susan Bay. I counted at least
ten
different whales!

Orca Network received a call from the US Coast Guard out of
La Push, WA
- they had a pod of
10 - 12 orcas
northbound at

2:15 pm
off La Push - lat/long: 47 56; 124 57.
*
We capped off the day with a smallish
Minke whale
in the
Strait of Georgia
, just east of Georgeson Island. It was doing the usual Minke meanderings, surfacing briefly and changing direction frequently. It seemed to be working it's way further out into the strait, following the barely visible tide lines. We observed a few surfacings that appeared to involve some lunge feeding.
