Orca Sightings for May 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
J's
, at least, maybe
L's
, were chirping up a storm on
Orcasound hydrophones
for about four hours last evening, from around
6 to 10 pm
. No cargo ships, no buzz boats, just loud and clear calls from whales in serious party mode.

Following up on a report of orcas on the
east side of Galiano Island
, we located
a large group of Transients
travelling southeast. As we were approaching, the location of the group was apparent from some very large splashes. On arrival, the whales were milling, doing long dives, and vocalizing. Seems we may have arrived during dinner. As the group continued south, most were traveling very close together, maintaining approximately 7 knots, and occasionally porpoising. The group consisted of
T124, T124D, T124E, the T100's
and possibly another female with a calf two+ years old. Slightly further offshore, T87 was traveling with a female, presumably T88. The T100's, T124's were last seen heading south past Gossip Island, while T87 and 88 were observed heading west into Active Pass. We continued south to the Belle Chain Islets to check on the juvenile Stellar sea lions, California sea lions and harbour seals that haul out on the rocky shores. To our surprise, we encountered yet another group of T's lurking offshore of the Belle Chain. This time it was the T101's and T102. They were very spread out and appeared to be foraging, perhaps hoping to find a naive young sea lion that strayed from the haulout. Several very pregnant harbour seals wisely stayed onshore as the T's cruised past. We left this last group in the early afternoon, heading southeast in the Strait.
