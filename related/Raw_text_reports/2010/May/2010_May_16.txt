Today around
130 pm
we were in our boat out of the shores of
edmonds
. We were watching the regatta race and there in the middle of it was a single
grey whale
. When we first saw it he was playing and he was raising his head out of the water. After a while he slowly headed north and all you could really see was just his spout hole. We have not seen him before due to not making it up that way alot yet. But cant wait to spend a summer watching these beautiful creatures.
