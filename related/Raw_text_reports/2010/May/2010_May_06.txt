============================================================

Entry 1:
Here's a report if you didn't get it from someone else, as seen on Nanaimo, TV Evening news: There was a
gray whale
traveling about False Creek (near the city of
Vancouver
) on
May 5 and
May 6. Video was shown.
May 6th a large pod - maybe about 100 - of what looked like
Pacific white sided dolphins
was also seen near the city of
Vancouver
today. Video was shown.

At

4:10 PM
, we heard the blows from
a gray
, feeding just offshore at
Tulalip Shores
. Trees obstructed our view, but we heard the blows move north towards Spee-bi-dah. Based on the timing of the blows, it seemed there was only one whale.

Nancy Zaretzke called to report
1 Gray whale
feeding in Saratoga Passage off Hidden Beach, N. Greenbank at

7:20 am
, heading north slowly, close to shore.
*
Point No Point
, Kitsap County, between the Lighthouse and Hansville Store about

8:00 pm
I looked out at the rosy colored sky and there only about 30 feet or so from shore was a very, very large
grey whale
leisurely feeding in the shallows. I watched until it grew dark, over an hour. The grey didn't cover much ground, but moved back and forth over about a 300 yard area. Lots of spouts!!! We spotted him in the same area about
10 AM
and then it moved north staying close to shore.

I just happened to pick up the binoculars again today and lucked out to find
~6 porpoise
in
Saratoga Passage
, swimming S off Hidden Beach N. of Greenbank, at

4:42 pm
. I believe they were Harbor porpoise, but they were too distant to confirm species.

I was on the
3:50 ferry from Bainbridge and half way to Seattle there was a
porpoise
jumping next to the ferry boat about 4 times completely out of the water. He was alone and having fun. I have
never seen this particular type of porpoise
in Puget Sound. It was mottled gray and black, quite narrow, 3 feet long. It looked nothing like a Dall's Porpoise which is the one I most frequently have seen while traveling the waters of Puget Sound.
