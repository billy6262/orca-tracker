Orca Sightings for May 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transients are the new Residents. At least when it comes to being around in May! We had two trips and got to see two different groups of
Transients
! As we left the dock, we had reports of
T40 Captain Hook and T86A & T86A2
just at the bottom of
San Juan Island
. But before we left the harbor, we got a call that there was also a group of
12 Transients just north of Eastpoint
. So Captain Ivan decided to head north even though it meant a longer trip, and it was worth it! The waters were pretty calm and at first we spotted what turned out to be
T87
. Soon we were close enough to watch the larger group of transients all coming to the surface at the same time as they made their way up Georgia Strait. And wouldn't you know it, by the time we got back to Friday Harbor, we had the opportunity to get a quick viewing of T40 as he passed right past the entrance to Friday Harbor. Our second trip of the day was much shorter, as T40 and gang had not made much headway. We watched as the group continued up
San Juan Channel
, then turned towards
Presidents Channel
, and then turned again towards Point Disney on Waldron.

At
1300
the
Ts
were heading NW off the
Belle Chain
in two groups at first.
T87 and T88
were traveling together.
T100s
(without T100D born in 2006),
T124s
and others made up the main group. They were travelling at approx. 3 knots with whale watch companies and a couple of pleasure boaters following. Long dives of 4 to 5 minutes . At approx. 1400 the T100s split from the group. T100E was seen staying close to mom T100. This baby frequently surfaces on her back. The male T87, born about 1963, has very visible wounds on the top of both sides of the dorsal fin (most likely tooth rakes). Only activity observed for the afternoon was travelling as they continued NW passed Poirier Pass at
1730
.

Jeffry Gottfried called to report a sighting of
4 orcas
about 100 yards from the beach at
Cannon Beach OR
, at
5 pm
. He thought at least two looked like males.

I know it was not an Orca. There was no dorsal visible and the body was molted black and gray. So this could be a possible gray. Sighted around N49 00.000 W123 44.014. Heading North - North East up Stuart Channel. Slow moving, we first spotted it at
16:20, as we were approaching Ladysmith - approx 5 miles out - heading in the same direction as we were. It then turned NE towards Yellow Point. It would surface about every 5 to 10 minutes before diving. No tail was ever shown us. Only noticed one. We have seen Orcas in the area before, but not Grays. Hope this helps.

Our favourite group of T's were around again today. They are becoming more resident than the residents these days. Light was a little better than on Friday. We were fortunate to once again locate
transient orcas in the Strait of Georgia
, east of the Belle Chain Islands, shortly after noon. As we arrived on scene, a few of them were milling, and there were many seagulls picking at scraps, so we must have arrived during lunch again. With the meal over, the group headed northwest, eventually catching up to a larger group of approx 6 animals. Two others,
T87 and T88
, were off to the east, keeping in range of the big group, but separate. For the remainder of our viewing, the large group of the
T100's, T124, T124D, T124E, T90 and T90B
surfaced close together approximately every 5 minutes, for 5 breaths or so, as they continued to travel in a northwesterly direction. We last saw them heading towards
Georgeson Island
.

Gray
in very shallow water giving
Bell's Beach
a feeding show for nearly an hour before heading North. I have pic of pec fins- was hoping to find link to ID on Cascadia or your home page, but could only find sides.

This is the same gray whale that was feeding in Greenbank
May 27 - see photo below - but don't have the ID from Cascadia just yet. Veronica Allworden has some pec shots with IDs -hg

I was getting into my waders this morning around

5:30
, enjoying the sunrise and eagles talking when I heard a familiar blow. I watched one
gray whale
feeding on ghost shrimp for about 20 minutes in close to shore just east of
Langley
.
