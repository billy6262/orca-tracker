Orca Sightings for May 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw a group of
orcas
heading north off of
punta gorda california
. The male was very distinctive he was a large animal and was missing the top quarter or third of his dorsal - he was traveling with apx. three females. We were apx three miles west of the punta gorda at apx
10 am
.

The afternoon trip took Vanessa and I over 52 nm North of Victoria. 2nm East of Porlier Pass (top end of
Galiano Island
) we encountered the
T-100's
. The whales were all grouped together and seemed to be staying in one location doing long dives. Based on this behaviour and the presence of gulls circling the area, we presumed that they were actively feeding - having a late lunch. After about 25 minutes of staying in one spot the whales started to swim to the Northwest towards Gabriola Island. Earlier in the day, we had heard from Jim Maya, that they were together with other Transients, however, we could not find the other animals at all.

Capt. Jim Maya called at

to report a
Humpback
whale off west
San Juan Island
between False Bay and Eagle Pt, heading SE.

We got word of another whale being sighted at Andrew's Bay heading south. We encountered the whale north of False Bay and soon i.d. the whale as a young
Humpback
Whale. It seemed to be traveling south along the west side of
San Juan Island
. During our tour we also encountered both Harbor and Dall's Porpoise and believe we may have even seen a Hybrid!

We found a cetacean traveling all by itself along San Juan Island, a juvenile
humpback
! He would come to the surface with a massive blow, and then dive for 5-7 minutes. We watched him for about 30 minutes, and as we were preparing to depart, he passed by the bow and gave a beautiful tail fluke dive.

We encountered the
3 Minke Whales
not far from the Hein Bank Marker this
afternoon
and two of them were very close together.
