Orca Sightings for May 7, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We are getting ready to move from our "upper First St" home where for 10 years we have enjoyed visits by feeding
gray whales
and lo and behold we had what is likely a final visit of the season, tonight at

9:05pm
.
A single gray whale
fed at the shoreline at the bottom of our yard. Since we are moving just one block down the street and will still have a water view, we do expect to enjoy gray whale visits here in
Langley
.

Chris Bert onboard the SEA boat "Indigo" called to report
a Gray whale
in Crescent Harbor, near
Oak Harbor
, Whidbey Island at

6:54 pm
. It was on the west side of the Harbor, heading south.
*
Connie Barrett of Camano Island called to report one large
Gray whale
off W. Camano Island, close to shore feeding, heading north toward Utsalady at

6:07 pm
.
*
Our Stranding Network received a call at

4:32 pm
from Lisa at Maylor Point,
Oak Harbor
reporting a stranded orca beaching itself off the sea plane base. From the description it was determined it was the Gray whale that has been feeding close to shore in this area over the past month. Others on the beach said it swam away toward the commissary on the sea plane base. Their descriptions were more like a
gray whale
.
*
Riding the Clinton to
Mukilteo
ferry to work at around

7:15
, a few friends and I were lucky enough to see a
gray whale
. I spotted it as it suddenly came up out of the water (closer to the Mukilteo side) and dove revealing its fluke. We didn't see it for a few minutes after that, but it came up again blowing and diving repeatedly at a leisurely pace. Seemed to be heading southward and was alone. What a way to start a day!

We had two separate encounters with individual
Minke whales
in the straits -- between
Protection Island and Port Townsend
, about one mile off-shore. We were fishing for halibut north of McCurdy Point, the whale seemed to be feeding (spotted roughly moving in a circle).

Several
Orcas
from The
AD Pod
sighted yesterday (5/7) foraging and traveling along Fox Island in Resurrection Bay near
Seward, Kenai Fjords National Park
, around 14 miles south west of Seward, AK. 60 degrees 7 N, 149 degree 27 w. Appeared to be traveling -possibly foraging close to shore. Also a lot of
Humpback
activity, including a Mom and Calf as well as what we thought was some Lunge feeding.

Mark Malleson of Victoria called to report
Transient orcas T124C and CA58
(California Transient recently seen with T103) heading north up
President's Channel
(
N of San Juan Island
) between
4 - 5 pm
, heading toward Parker Reef.
*
1600
:
2 transient killer whales
heading north up
President's Channel
. Beam Reach students are observing with towed array and have heard some calls.

At
1320
we found
two transient orcas
traveling northwest up
San Juan Channel
near Yellow Island. Both animals had nicks in their dorsal fins, but we were unable to make an ID. At 1410 we left the area and then met back up with the whale watch fleet and the orcas at
1545
on the west side of Orcas Island traveling North. The animals appeared to just be transiting and there was no evidence of feeding or resting during either encounter.
