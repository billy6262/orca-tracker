We headed east towards the belle chain islands to check out the Steller sea lion haul out and on our way we got a big surprise!! At the east point of
Mayne Island
(Swanson Channel) we saw a dorsal fin in the distance and then the huge fin of
T20
surfaced along with four others! When we first arrived there was a lot of playing and looked like even a little mating! Then they continued to head west along the shore of Galiano island.

We were already on our homeward journey this afternoon, 5 T's had been spotted in Georgia Strait near the southeast corner of
Mayne Island
. When we arrived on scene, we observed 5 individuals that appeared to be resting as they moved slowly northwest close in to the Mayne Island shoreline. The whales were ID'ed as
T20, T21, T2C, T2C1 and T2C2
. The whales drifted a bit to the east as they moved by
Active Pass
, then moved back closer to the shoreline as they continued towards Galiano Island. We left the group headed northwest, at approximately
1530
hrs, just north of
Active Pass.
They appeared to be still in resting behaviour.
