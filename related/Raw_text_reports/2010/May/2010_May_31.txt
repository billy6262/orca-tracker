Orca Sightings for May 31, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were surprised today to find a couple
Transients
just south of the north arm of the
Fraser river
, just outside the harbour of
Vancouver
. They were milling around for a while and ended up playing with a seal for a while before finishing the kill. It was a great day but frustrating because I couldn't seem to ID these 2 whales.

From the Center for Whale Research: The whale with the little nick is 124C, but the one with the injury near the trailing edge of the fin is not known to us. Dave gave it his best. Ken

Jim Zimmerman saw
T40
heading south in
Rosario Strait
from Sharpe Park, Fidalgo Island, just south of Anacortes, at

3:30 pm
*
This trio,
T40
, the big guy with the "hooked" dorsal, and
T86A and T86A2
, were spotted yesterday in the morning down near
Cattle Pass
after being seen near Pt. Townsend yesterday. They spent the day munching their way from Cattle Pass, into San Juan Ch., almost into Friday Harbor, then up towards Waldron, passing on the north side of Waldron. Most of their kills were seals, though it seemed that they might have taken a porpoise down near Whale Rocks. We left them at dusk almost
between Sucia and Patos Islands
, headed northeast.

Erick Peirson called in a sighting of
T40
and two other
transient orcas
at
Fidalgo Head, Fidalgo Island
, heading south at

1:30 pm
. He said they were at East Point, Island BC, at 7 pm on
May 30.

While headed to Anacortes at

5:30 this afternoon
we passed a small group of
Orcas
just north of Spencer Spit on
Lopez
. There was one adult male with a droop to the top of his dorsal (anyone other than Captain Hook have one of those?). He was accompanied by 2-3 companions.

Three orcas
were trucking past Lions Bay (north of
Vancouver BC
, several miles inside Horseshoe Bay) yesterday at about
7 pm
heading north fairly rapidly.

On the afternoon 'Goldwing' tour, Vanessa and I traveled way over into
Rosario Strait
where we encountered
3 Transient Killer Whales
in Thatcher Pass. The whales were found to be
T-40 (Captain Hook), T-86A and T-86A1
. The animals were traveling close together swimming to the Northwest towards Upright Head Lopez Island. During our stay with these Transients we got very lucky as the adult female, T-86A, swam right over to us and went just below our vessel !!!! As she swam right under our vessel we could see her arch her head up to look at us. Once across to the other side of the boat she swam around the stern and then came up the other side all the while she was swimming on her side staring at the passengers on the back viewing platform of the boat. She was obviously doing a little people watching.... Absolutely amazing encounter with these 3 animals. T-86A has a satellite tag on her right side of her dorsal fin, which allows the researchers to track this group of whales as they swim all through the waters of the Pacific Northwest. These Transients average over 100 miles (160 km/h) per day !!!!
