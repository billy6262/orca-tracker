Orca Sightings for May 12, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a report from Jimmy Brizzee, -
a few orcas
5 - 6 miles out of
Port Orford, OR
at
1 pm
, including 1 adult male. He was in a 22' boat and they were swimming under it, 1 breaching, etc. in about 60 fathoms of water. A lot of sea lions were present in the same area.

I was out on the Ocean Magic at
noon
and we headed north up Haro Strait toward
Spieden Island
in the San Juans. It was here, at
1.40 pm
that we saw this rather active
grey whale
. It was foraging close to the shoreline of Spieden Island and took two deep dives during the time we were observing it. Lifting its tail we were able to see the unique markings on its flukes. A lovely encounter with this whale in very pleasant conditions.

Around

9:30 AM
we were very surprised to be able to see a
gray whale
from our dock in
Friday Harbor
! It was heading north up San Juan Channel, and we were with it on the boat from

10:05-
10:50
during our morning trip. I heard it went up Spieden Channel and through Johns Pass (!) before we met up with the animal again in the afternoon. Between

3:00 and
3:30 PM
it was heading northeast up
Boundary Pass
near Skipjack Island. It was going for fairly long dives of up to seven minutes and at times would only surface once or twice between dives. It did fluke a couple of times as well.

gray whale
just north of
San Juan Island
Point Caution (gps: 48.57089 N, 123.02851 W) in the (San Juan) channel. It was moving about .25 miles off the shoreline.

a Gray whale
in
San Juan Channel
at Pt. Caution, 1 mile N. of Friday Harbor Labs at
11:30 am, heading north slowly. At

12:10
he called back to report it was coming up to Limestone Pt. in Speiden Channel, still heading north.
