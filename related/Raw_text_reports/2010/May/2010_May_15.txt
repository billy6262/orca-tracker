Orca Sightings for May 15, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
During a joint field project between the Northwest Fisheries Science Center and Cascadia we satellite tagged a mammal-eating killer whale -
T90
. For more information on our study of movement patterns of mammal-eating killer whales see our website here.

Transient Tagging Project
*
7 transients
spent about 7 hours traveling about 7 miles!
T87, T88, T90, T90B, T124, T124D and T124E
acted more like a group of Southern Residents than the typical unpredictable zigzagging transient behavior that is common with Ts. Of course they were in a resting mode for a large portion of the time. They were first reported at
Pile Pt
. in a resting mode at about

8:30 in the morning.
By noon they had made it to Lime Kiln park a distance of just a few miles. They split into two groups T87 with T124, T124D and T124E and the other three T88, T90 and T90B in the farther offshore group still going north. The last I heard they were at
Open Bay
, a few miles north of Lime Kiln at

3:30
.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries relayed a report from Ron Bates of Victoria's MMRG of a small group of
orcas
off
Pile point
in the
morning
.
*
Kathy Fritts of Freeland called to relay a report of
orcas
milling in
Saratoga Passage
N. of Greenbank, at

12:05 pm
, heading north closer to the Whidbey side. Nancy Zaretzke had observed one or two orcas off Hidden Beach a short time before that, heading north.
*
Barb Nichols called to report a couple of
Orcas
in
Saratoga Passage
near Baby Island at the entrance to Holmes Harbor, at

7:30 am
.
*
We watched
2 orcas
about Â¼ mile east of
Baby Island, Saratoga Passage
in shallow water swimming a tight circle. They must have been hunting because they continued the tight circle for several minutes, got the binoculars and saw one roll on his(?) side and saw a fairly large pool of blood in the water but did not see any seal or fish pieces floating. They then headed north. One appeared to have a notch out of his aft dorsal fin about half way up. This all took place about

7:15am
.

I called to report a
gray whale
siting on the East side of
Jetty Island, Everett
. We first spotted it around

5:06 pm
and it hung around for at least an hour. We were parked at the 12th Street Yacht basin which is right next to the Everett Boat Launch, the last time I saw him he was headed south and hopefully back out into Sound.

We enjoyed the sight of what looked like a small
gray whale
proceeding up river in front of Anthony's homeport in
Everett
. It raised several times and blew, right in front of the restraint. The time frame was around
4-5 pm
.

About

10:30 AM
from
Lagoon Point
(SW Whidbey Isl) there was
either a very large porpoise or a small whale
going back and forth (north and south). At one point it surfaced for about a minute before going back down.
