Orca Network received a call from Veronica von Allworden reporting
2 Gray whales
off
N. Langley
at

11:30 am
, heading north. One of the whales looked like it could have been #53 (see Cascadia Research's Gray whale ID guide here). They were 1/4 of the way out in the passage, heading NW. At noon, they were traveling side by side, closer to the Camano Island side.

Fred Lundahl of Langley called Orca Network to report
3 Gray whales
in
Saratoga Passage
, closer to the Camano Island side at

12:20 pm
, heading NW. The Langley "Whale Bell" was rung for the first time this year!

John Herman called Orca Network at

12:15 pm
to relay a 2nd hand report of a possible
Minke Whale
(
humpback
? See below) off
Point No Point
.
*
At

2:20pm
we were at
Point No Point
beach and sighted, along with many others, a large
whale
surfacing about 40 yards offshore from the eastern edge of PNP. It was traveling NW at a slow pace. It would surface, then we'd see a dorsal fin, then the fluke. It did this several times each time it surfaced. We thought it might be a minke because it didn't seem as mottled as a grey. But on looking online, it seems it could have been a humpback and I read there was another hump spotted a few days ago. Thanks

Since this whale was observed fluking, it wouldn't be a Minke, so sounds like it is possibly the Humpback sighted recently in Puget Sound - ON
