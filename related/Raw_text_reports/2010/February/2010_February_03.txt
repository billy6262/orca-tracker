Orca Sightings for February 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Feb. 2 - 3 - Throughout the day and night of 2 February, and in the morning of 3 February,
transient killer whale calls
were intermittently heard on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
, but no whales could be seen by observers from San Juan Island, until at
0830
Jeanne Hyde spotted fins on the Canadian side of the border near
Kelp reef
. Ken Balcomb and Mark Malleson headed out in r/v "Orca" from Oak Bay, Canada and encountered a large group of transient killer whales very close to shore just north of Baynes Channel. Within two hours they photo-identified
27 individuals
, including new calves T100E and T124A4, as the whales dispersed in matrilineal groups and hunted for marine mammals south of Victoria, BC. An oily patch near them at Constance Bank at 1230 suggested they had found at least one seal. In the afternoon, the whales turned toward the east as if heading toward Dungeness Spit. Mark and Ken preliminarily identified 27 whales in the evening, and Dave Ellifrit confirmed: the T30's, T86's, T87, T88, T90's, T100's, T101's, T102, T124's, T124A's, and T172 - a Superpod of transients!

Postscript: Brad Hanson and Greg Schorr went out aboard the NWFSC research boat on 4 February when this large group of transients ventured into Puget Sound, and they applied satellite tags to two individuals (T100B and T100C). These two whales (and perhaps some of their colleagues) have since traveled from Puget Sound to Georgia Strait off Nanaimo, to the east of Cortes Island, back to Nanaimo, down to the south of Saltspring Island, back up almost to Campbell River, and by
February 11 are off Texada Island heading back south! Mark Malleson, meanwhile has found the T30's and T172 off Victoria, so the superpod has apparently dispersed.

Mark Malleson and I have made a preliminary review of our photos and it appears that there were
27 Transients
, including the new calf of T100 which Graeme Ellis and Jared Towers have given the designation T100E. Great day!

I started hearing
Transient calls
again this morning just before
6 a.m
. The calls continued and continued, something that seemed unusual for transients. As it turned out I found the Ts at about

8:30 a.m
. coming south 4+ miles from shore and 1+ miles south of
Kelp Reef
- there were evidently more whales behind them and that would explain the sounds on the hydrophones, which ended at about

9:30 a.m.
I went out the Jim Maya this afternoon and we saw the transients south of
Race Rocks
. After arriving they turned and headed back in toward Pt. Angeles. There was pinkish calf in the group. There were a lot - at least 15. I have posted some pics from the day on my
blog
. I also posted a recording - one of the calls sequences it sounds like there are a bunch of cats fighting - very interesting.

One just had to be out on the water this special day when it was reported that a big group pf
Transients
were heading this way past
Oak Bay, Victoria BC
. Mark Malleson and Ken Balcomb were out there first in the morning, so by
2pm
when the Prince of Whales zodiac, skippered by Mark, left the harbour I was wondering which direction those whales might be traveling and how much distance they had made. Luckily the exact location was known and we found them south and east of Race Rocks in American waters. It was impressive to see so many Transients together. Initially, we found them in resting formation, and then doing what transients do best, Zig-Zagging all over. It was lovely to see a brand new calf with the T100's. Eventually we left them while they headed back east. It was an amazing sight to see so many transients together.

I am a new user of the hydrophone network, but this morning, from about 0910 to 0920 Eastern Time (
0610 - 0620
Pacific time), I heard some
echolocation
coming from the
hydrophones
at both
Lime Kiln
and the
OrcaSound
hydrophone on San Juan Island. The calls were stronger at the OrcaSound hydrophone, not Lime Kiln, but came in stronger at Lime Kiln towards the end of my listening bout. I am not certain these are killer whales; like I said, I am a new listener and cannot identify everything I hear. But this is the first time I have ever heard anything of note on the hydrophone network, and I am excited about it.
