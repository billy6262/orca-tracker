Orca Sightings for February 20, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were hiking along the lagoon and beach near
Ebeys Landing
around

2:30
and spotted a
gray whale
only about 50 yards from the beach. It seemed unusual to have a whale on the Admiralty Inlet side of the island. I believe it was a single gray whale, not very large as whales go (perhaps 20 feet?) It seemed to be feeding just off of the coast. We spotted it twice within about 15 minutes. At first we saw the spray from the blowhole and then its body roll through the top of the water.

Veronica von Allworden called Orca Network at

3:45 pm
, to report
2 Gray whales
1 mile south of
Possession Pt
, SW Whidbey Island, traveling east.

My friend Bev MacKenzie and I were walking the
Ebey's Bluff Trail, Whidbey Island
, on Saturday when we saw a spout. Very near the shore off of Perego's Lake. I believe it was a single
gray
. It only spouted and rolled so we never saw the fluke. Was there over an hour about
4 - 5pm
.

4:30pm to
5:10pm
, Rietta spotted a
gray whale
blow mid-channel in front of
Tulalip Shores
. The whale was heading North still mid-channel until reaching Spee-bi-dah Bay, at which point it turned into Spee-be-dah and we lost sight of him.

One, and possibly two (although two were never seen simulataneously)
gray whales
(see above photo) spotted at

3:00 PM
, at the north end of Perego's Lagoon (Ebey's Landing), west side of
Whidbey Island
. Approximately 150 feet off shore. Presumably feeding since the whale(s) remained in the same area for an extended period of time, and they were over what appeared to be a submerged bar trailing to the NW from the most seaward point of the sandbar forming Perego's Lagoon. Lattitude 48 deg 12.156 minutes N, longitude 122 deg 44.335 minutes W.

What a delightful day at Ebey's Landing (W.
Whidbey Island
). We saw a
gray whale
feeding along the shore next to PEREGO'S Lagoon today, at about

1:00pm
. This whale was out there for several hours and seemed to be heading slightly north. So close to shore and so fun to watch.
