mid-channel, Port Susan between Tulalip Shores and

Around
1000
hrs we saw several
gray whale
spouts mid channel directly in front of Sunny Shores on the Tulalip Reservation. They were moving slowly into the head of
Port Susan
. It appeared there were 2-3 adults and one calf. They were not moving too quickly and being mid channel were too far away to take photos. Seems early to have them visit us, but it is an El Nino year. Nice to know they are in the neighborhood again.
