Orca Sightings for February 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Here are a couple pictures from about

3:00 to
4:30 PM
, this
Humpback
mingled with us about a mile south of Possession. It's a young whale, about 30 feet in length. I've read the recent Humpback sightings in Puget Sound but have seen no photos. So here you go, proof that it is really here direct from the Whale Whisperer, Mukilteo, WA.
