Orca Sightings for February 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
A second hand report of
7 Orca
off the south end of
Gabriola Island
from two fellows fishing for salmon around
noon
. The fellows were more concerned about the panicked California Sea Lions eyeing up their boat as a haul out than the Orcas!

I saw
one gray whale
at

6:00
off the top of
Saratoga Road
(latitude 48.096429, longitude -122.512590). It was feeding in the shallows on, presumably, ghost shrimp. It hung around for about half an hour and headed east and south along the bluff where I could still hear it but not see it.
Linda Frasier, Whidbey Island

One gray whale
at entrance to
Elger Bay on Camano
, feeding at

5:30 pm
. Many birds feeding on the disturbed ghost shrimp and other marine life.
Dodie Markey, Camano Island

Nancy Zaretzke of Greenbank called Orca Network to report
1 Gray whale
off Crane's Landing Rd, (North Bluff/
Greenbank, E Whidbey Island
) at
4 pm
, heading south toward Hidden Beach.
*
Georgina Silby called Orca Network to report they were in a sailboat between
NW Camano Island and the entrance to Penn Cove
(N. Saratoga Passage), and saw a Gray whale at

2:15 pm
, closer to Camano but heading east toward Penn Cove.
