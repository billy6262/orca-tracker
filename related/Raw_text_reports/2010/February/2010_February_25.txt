Orca Sightings for February 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got back inside after spending about 1 1/2 hours watching
2 gray whales
in front of our home, just south of the
Mabana Road
. About

2:30 PM
I noticed the 2 grays (one large, one much smaller) feeding in the shallows. Lots of stirred up sediment and waving pec fins. Must have been lots to eat as they stayed in one place for an extended time. They finally moved out deeper and slowly headed north toward the Mabana Road.

Orca Network received a call from Gerry Pitsch at

11:45 am
, reporting
two Gray whales
feeding .5 miles off
West Beach
two miles south of NAS Whidbey Island (NW Whidbey).
*
To advise
a grey whale
feeding off Edgecliff Drive (about 1/2 mile east of downtown Langley) at
10am
. This is an area that the greys regularly feed due to the ready availability of ghost shrimp; although, this is very early for transients. Presumably, it is a "residential" grey. It appears to be moving slowly to the west/north up Saratoga Passage.

Wanted to let you know there was
a lone (gray)
whale here at
Witter Beach
near Langley, Whidbey Island, at about

8:40 am
feeding. By the time I noticed him he was already bit past our place heading north.
