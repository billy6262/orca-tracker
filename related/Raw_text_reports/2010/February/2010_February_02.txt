Entry 1:
At

12:16
I began picking up
transient calls
on the
Lime Kiln
hydrophones. Most were faint but within the next 1/2 hour the volume increased a surprising amount on a couple of the calls.

PST I hear faint
Orca call
at
Lime Kiln.
I have been hearing calls for about a hour or so -- in and out depending on the back ground noise.
