J Pod
all day today...Just as we were getting onto the boat, we overheard a VHF transmission...Going south at
Kellet Bluff
. Kellet Bluff is right outside of Snug Harbor and our dock. As we worked our way out into
Haro Strait
, here they came. So we say there and watched them go by. And so it was for the rest of the day. J Pod ...also had the grace to go north, so at
7:30, we strolled back into Mitchell Bay, with them right outside the bay, going north.
