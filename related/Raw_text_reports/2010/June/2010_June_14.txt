Orca Sightings for June 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a nice trip north and west around San Juan Island to find
orcas
from
J-Pod
near shore off of
Lime Kiln Point
State Park. Amazing to watch five generations of an orca family; J-2 Granny, estimated to be 99 years old, along with her son J-1 Ruffles estimated at 59 years old, and constant traveling companion J-8 Spieden estimated 77 years old! However it looked like little 9 year old J-37 Hy'Shqa was ahead of the adults, spending some time with great grandma J-2! They seemed to be foraging, looking for salmon. The rest of J-Pod was spread out behind them in Haro Strait, and reports were that K-Pod had headed toward the south end.

Orca Network received a call from Fran Banasick of
Greenbank
, reporting
a Gray whale
in
Saratoga Passage
off Greenbank Beach near Wonn Rd. at

2:45 pm
. Howard went to try to find it, and about 30 minutes later finally saw a spout further out and further south into Holmes Harbor, where the whale appeared to be heading south.

2359
- The automated detector at the Orcasound hydrophone recorded a single
S19 call
just before midnight, so there is a hint that L pod is southbound in Haro Strait and (now that I hear lots of echolocation at
Lime Kiln
) foraging.

I tuned in to the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
at

7:55 pm
to hear some
Orca
chatter. Its
8:40 now and the sounds are incredible.

2011 - K pod
has definitely been hanging around for a while with their S-16 'mews' at
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. Lime Kiln, 2119 - just hearing some s-1s again too, so Jpod is around again as well.

I have been listening to what I believe to be
L pod
on the
Lime Kiln State Park hydrophone
since about

7:45pm
. They sound like they are very close and it is now
8:45pm. Very high pitched long squeaks and chirping. A very active chat as it has been going on for over an hour.

Capt. Jim Maya called at

6:50 pm
to report they followed part of
J pod
(including J1 & J2) and L2, L78, & L88, up
Swanson Channel
to Navy Channel, where they turned and headed back south. Also at this time are 2 females and 1 calf in Open Bay, San Juan Island.

After watching
J's and the L2's
pass by the Center for Whale Research (NW San Juan Island), Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster and Erin Heydenreich departed Snug Harbor and headed north. We encountered
L88, L78, L2, J1 and J2
spread out off
Spieden Channel
traveling north at

3:23 p.m
. (48° 35.462 N,123° 12.463W). We later encountered J33 traveling with J8. The next group we spotted was the rest of the J16's, who appeared to be the last whales going north. Other J's and K's were reported further down the west side of San Juan Island. The encounter ended at
4:33 pm, three miles south of Turn Point (48° 40.373 N, 123° 14.179 W). Photos and map of the encounter here.

We had confirmation of whales approaching San Juan Island. It was a bit choppy down south, and [
orcas
] were heading north, so we looped over the top of the island and arrived just north of the
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
just as the whales were passing by. The whales were mostly hugging the shore, and we were staying 1/4 mile off shore (observing the voluntary no-boat zone). But that didn't mean we didn't get to see any whales! We had a very nice viewing of J1 Ruffles, who was hanging a bit offshore, as was J2 Granny. We also noted J8 Speiden, and J33 Keet. But the thrill of the day was a nice young male that passed about 150 yards off our starboard side. Big fin, finger saddle patch--so my mind went to J27 Blackberry. But something didn't quite look right, and our other naturalist Katie was beaming when she said it was L78 Gaia! I was skeptical at first, but sure enough, it was him!!! Even more exciting was the sighting by Katie of L2 Grace!! This is the first time this year that these whales had been seen so it was good to be able to check of that they made it through another winter. We didn't see my favorite L Pod whale in this group (L88 Wavewalker), but Jeanne called me to let me know he was lagging a bit behind but also present! We left the leaders just working the tide rips at Kellett Bluff heading north. We heard reports that some members of K Pod were also present further south around False Bay, but we didn't have time to see them.

I just received a report of a sighting made in the last half hour (bet.
11 &
11:30 am
) of at least
2 or 3 orcas
about ½ offshore from the mouth of the Siletz River,
Lincoln City, OR
. The caller said he saw one very tall dorsal fin and a seal flying out of the water to flee from them. He did not take any photographs.
