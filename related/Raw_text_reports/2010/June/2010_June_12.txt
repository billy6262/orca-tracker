Orca Sightings for June 12, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Puget Sound Express return from Friday Harbor to Port Townsend we saw at least
three minkes
hunting together in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
just south of eastern San Juan Island. One of them had a series of bumps forward of the dorsal fin.
Andrew Reding
Andrew sent his photos to Jonathan Stern of the NE Pacific Minke Project, and Jon replied: Nice photographs, thank you very much andrew - and we know these whales. the one with the bumps is interesting. these bumps are the spinous processes of the vertebrae - this animal is kind of thin, but they will disappear as he puts on some weight throughout the feeding season. or, of course he may be sick - but we have seen these bumps on a whale, and they have disappeared.

There was a lone
Minke
working his way south to north off of
Lagoon point, Whidbey Island
Saturday
afternoon
. Pretty slowly with long dives in between about 1/3 of the way into the channel. It was pretty clearly a Minke because of the smallish hook dorsal.

I wanted to pass on a report I received of
four orcas
sighted in
Yaquina Bay
near the Hatfield Marine Science Center pier, at about

8:30 PM
. No word on whether or not photos were taken. The central Oregon coast is certainly getting its share of sightings lately!
