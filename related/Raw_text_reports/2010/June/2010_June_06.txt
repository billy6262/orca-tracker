Orca Sightings for June 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The mist gave way to partially clear skies and calm seas as we headed around San Juan Island to find family groups of
J-Pod
and reports of
K-Pod
by
Kellet Bluff
! The whales had been swimming at a fast pace with the flooding- incoming tide. J-16 Slick and family slowed down and we were awed by a variety of behaviors; breaches, cartwheels, headstands, and tail lobs! Nineteen year old J-26 Mike and fifteen year old J-30 Ridptide were showing off their male parts! We also got a glimpse of one of the new calves of either J-28 or sister J-35.

A mix of
J and L pods
on the west side of
San Juan Island
from Lime Kiln Point State Park to Andrews Bay. Animals were spread out in several groups, converging and dispersing intermittently. We saw
L41, J28 with calf, J26
and many more not identified. There was very aggressive feeding behavior with multiple percussive displays. Just before we departed the scene at 1510 L41 displayed his "sea snake" while swimming with several females and possibly juveniles.

About 1/4 mile off
San Juan County Park
Ruffles
J1
was very easy to pick out, as was
J27
Blackberry and
J30
Riptide. They approached the large bed of bull kelp near Low Island (off San Juan County Park), and began to roll in the kelp. Long strands tangling dorsal fins and tail flukes. Dozens and dozens of spyhops. The whales would split into two groups, circle around the kelp,and then race back towards each other. From our vantage point, we saw one youngster roll over and was carried for awhile on the back of J27. A few breaches followed by more rolling, spyhops, and lolling at the surface.

Around

1:45pm
today, spotted a large # of orcas on the
orcacam
. They seemed to split into at least 3 different groups as they crossed the viewing area. A couple of the groups had the usual dozen boats nearby, but there was a couple groups that seemed to slip past them and got to travel in peace at least for a while.

We found ourselves in
Transient Orca
heaven once again today. We had a report of approximately 6 individuals in the
Strait of Georgia
, and after some effort, we managed to locate that group. It was the
T2C's and T123s
- 6 whales. We had last seen these two groups on the 24th of May, traveling northbound in the Strait. Now they were traveling slowly south, doing extremely long dives and possibly resting. While we waited for this group to surface, splashing and fins were noted about 1 mile away, closer to
Galiano Island
. We left the first group of resting T's, and met up with a larger group -
T87, T88, T90, T90B, the T100's, T124 and T124D
were Id'ed. These orcas were also traveling south, but in greater haste. However, when a seal was sensed on the surface, most of the group turned around. T87 and T88 continued southbound - more about them later. The T100's, T124's and T90's were determined to get that seal when suddenly, yet another seal appeared on the surface. Both seals lay very still, and it took many passes, some quite close to the seals, before the whales took one, then the other. With their mission accomplished, our group turned once again to the south and began porpoising down the Strait (see photo above). They kept up this amazing show of power for 15-20 minutes, at times reaching speeds over 12 knots. While speed swimming, the T100's, et al, passed right by the still slowly traveling T2C's and T123's without even a break in their pace. They eventually met up with T87 and T88 again, just north of Active Pass. They made a sharp right turn into Active Pass, and we left them traveling westbound through the pass at Miner's Bay. As we headed back across the Strait, there were the T2Cs, T123's, still slowly swimming south, although it appeared they might follow the T100's,etc. through Active Pass.
