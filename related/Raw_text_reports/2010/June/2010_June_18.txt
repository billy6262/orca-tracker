Orca Sightings for June 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We headed north, toward Turn Point on
Stuart Island
to catch up with
J Pod
. J Pod had been reported swimming north past Turn Point lighthouse. As we rounded the north side of Stuart, we started to see whale watch boats. Then, we started to see dorsal fins! Captain Mike motored the trusty MV Sea Lion toward a whale traveling in Boundary Pass. This whale turned out to be
19-year-old Mike (J26)
. Guests aboard viewed Mike as he traveled across Boundary Pass toward North Pender Island. The boat moved away from J26 and caught up with everyone's favorite whale - Ruffles (J1). He, too, was traveling toward North Pender Island. Eventually, we backtracked a bit. We caught up with a group of about 8 orcas, traveling in a close group. They appeared to be socializing - tail slaps, cartwheels, belly flops, and spy hops were in abundance today! These animals (like J26 and J1) were traveling towards North Pender. Eventually, they reached the shoreline and we traveled with them as they continued their socializing antics.

After watching the two groups passing by
Hannah Heights
in the morning (in the report sent 6/18), we had another pod pass Hannah Heights from about
4 - 6 pm
, heading north. It appeared to be J pod whales with some Ks (at least K21 & J27 were present). They were spread out in small groups, and the last group included 3 males (K21 & J27 +?) and 2 females traveling very close to each other in a tight group, going down & coming up together, one time surfacing together in a tight group of 4 dorsals and 1 fluke!
We saw them off
Lime Kiln
at about

6:30 pm
as they continued north, then at
9:30 pm we saw them pass the Center for Whale Research, NW San Juan Island, heading south as the light faded, and lastly, as noted above, we heard more whales from Hannah Heights after midnight - a great day of whale sightings and hearings!

Heard many
orcas
, Jpod and others on lime kiln hydrophones, about

22:05-
23:00
and then some after in distance until the writing of this email at
23:29.

Val's program WhoListener picked up a single [
orca
] detection earlier this evening at

20:27
at Orcasound (near Smuggler's Cove
north of Lime Kiln
). The recording is of some weird combination of a s4 and a S10 call and then some clicks. The next detection was at
22:16 at Lime Kiln at the beginning of the current vocal event.

2237
: Faint echoing
SRKW calls
on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. Getting louder... but not audible on Orcasound. Mostly S2s, so perhaps J pod?

At

11:45
I was flying across the bay towards Everett and spotted a
Gray Whale
northwest of the marine marker (west of
Everett
and North of Hat Island), feeding in the shallow water! I didn't recognize the whale. It does have a distinctive white spot on its left side similar to #53's.

We watched from
Hannah Heights
as members of
J and K pods
traveled, foraged and played along the west side of San Juan Island starting at
8 am
and continuing until around noon. Several of the J pod calves were especially energetic with multiple breaches, spy hops and tiny tail lobs as they played together! From about 8 -
9:30 they seemed to be heading N, with many direction changes and foraging behaviors. At 10 am some of them headed back south, followed by more heading south around
11 am
.

Calls
at
Lime Kiln Hydrophones
, Loads of clicking.
Lon Brockelhurst, Olympia
*
Lime Kiln hydrophone - 0756
- Hearing loud
clicks and calls
(lots of S1s and some S4s implies J pod). First autodetection was at
07:40 at Lime Kiln and there were no others earlier at Orcasound, so they may be traveling north.

Lime Kiln at

7:30 am
your time. Started hearing faint calls around then, fading as boat passed. Became louder and more numerous with calls at
7:40 your time with splashes heard. Frequency of calls faded at
7:44 am, but could be heard intermittently. Quite loud squeals and blows at
7:50 am, some splashing and knocking as if at the hydrophone. Very loud clicking sounds heard as well as loud calls to
8:01 am. OMG!! Clicking continued thereafter, calls ceased. Clicking was more distant. Stopped listening at

8:11
, though calls and clicks were still able to be heard, and getting louder again.
