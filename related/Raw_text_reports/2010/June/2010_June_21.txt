Orca Sightings for June 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:45 p.m.
- 5 miles south of
Pt. Roberts
, headed south, almost directly toward the Patos Island Lighthouse, while on the Peregrine of Maya's Westside Charters, we encountered
Southern Residents
. Leading were Raggedy K-40 and Cappuccino K-21. There was a group of whales not far behind the leaders: DoubleStuf J-34, Oreo J-22, Cookie J-38, Opus K-16, Sonata K-35, Rhapsody J-32, and Tsuchi J-31. Blackberry J-27 was behind this group and off to their right. Word was that there was a large group 4 to 5 miles behind this group.

8:20 p.m.
I began hearing faint calls on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
and the first calls heard were K pod S-16 calls (the kitten sound) - then a few J pod calls. There were a few calls but mainly echolocation clicks that continued until about
11:30 pm.

9:06 p.m.
- passing southbound at
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
in the lead were Raggedy K-40 and Cappuccino K-21, DoubleStuf J-34, Oreo J-22, Cookie J-38, and several others but too dark to get any other IDs.

4:30 pm
:
Transient
encounter - As we were returning from seeing the residents to the north,
4 transients
were near the
Cactus Islands
(north of San Juan Island). These were the same Ts that were in San Juan Channel earlier in the day.
T65A, T65A2, T65A3 and T36A1
were present. The mom of T36A1 was not present during the short encounter as these four whales had a meal of most likely a harbor seal.

J pod at Lime Kiln

From

7:45pm to
8:20pm
by the Willows on the West side of
Lummi Island
, there were about
14 Orca's
headed south along West shore drive. 5 males were in the group I know because they have tall fins. Some tail slapping by 2 whales and a big hop and side splash by one. glad to be alive. No tour boats in sight.

Happy Solstice whales - finally!
orcas
passing off
Lummi Island
at

7:30 p.m.
going south - spotted mid-channel out near Clark and Barnes Islands - some great breaches and a cartwheel! spread out, a few large fins, possibly J1 in there - darn it, too far to ID - last seen and heard heading towards Lummi Rocks and beyond. p.s. also counted 14 eagles (mature and imm.) at Viti Rocks - gulls were NOT happy.

We spotted
3 or 4 Orcas
leaving the Friday Harbor marina and heading up north in the
San Juan Channel
at around
2 p.m.
. I took some pictures of them from the weather station at the Friday Harbor Labs Campus. They came really close to the rocks, it was exciting!

Thanks to the photos sent by Thomas, these orcas were identified by Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research as the
T65As plus T36A1
.

Erick Peirson called to report 3 female and one juvenile
Transient Orca
in
Griffin Bay, NW San Juan Island
, preying on a seal from
11 -
11:52 am
.

I was out flying this evening and at

4:50 PM
I spotted a
Gray Whale
to the west of the marine marker north of Hat Island and west of
Everett
. The whale was not feeding but swimming along the drop off in a southeasterly direction toward the east tip of Hat Island. I did not have my camera but it looked like the same whale that I saw a couple of days ago.
