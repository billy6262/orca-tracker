- [
orcas
] spotted in the distance from
Lime Kiln
. They were down island near False Bay area and appeared to be milling.

12:27p.m.
in the fog the following whales were spotted. Several had gone up past Lime Kiln light and turned back south. Cappuccino K-21, Raggedy K-40, DoubleStuf J-34, Oreo J-22, Cookie J-38, Riptide J-30 traveling with one unidentified whale (possibly K-35).

5:00 pm
- traveling north slowly, appearing to be foraging, echo clicks heard but no vocals, were J-34 in the lead with J-22 and J-38 together behind him; then K-21 and K-40. J-34 passed the lighthouse and J-22 and J-38 barely made it to the lighthouse when they turned and went back down island. K-21 and K-40 were farther south and also turned and went back down island. click here for Jeanne's Blog.

We headed out at
2pm
and our sunny day soon turned to dense fog as we reached Cattle Pass. We had reports of
J'pod and K21 & K40
spread out on the West side of
San Juan Island
. Captain Hobbes with JB's assistance navigated carefully to Eagle Point Area where we soon spotted J26 (Mike) a 19 yr old male and J16 (Slick) his 38 year old mother. They seemed to be content to mill off the point; surfacing very slowly with each breath. After awhile the whales changed direction, picked up some speed and were joined by J42 (Echo) Slick's 3 year old daughter. The fog lifted; J42 playfully swam upside down, sideways did a few breaches and then a spy hop and cartwheel! Our already happy crowd were delighted by this activity and the awesome scenery that revealed itself as the fog lifted. To top it off we spotted a
Minke Whale
off
South Beach
on the way back to Friday Harbor.

I was flying over the bay west of
Everett
at

3:00 PM
and photographed a
Gray Whale
that I think is the same one I've seen feeding there for the last week. The whale was feeding on its left side and releasing huge clouds of mud and silt. It was northwest of the marine marker directly west of Jetty Island. There were several seals and sea gulls staying close by .

A
Gray Whale
has been hanging out in and near
Victoria Harbour
for the
last four days
! Yesterday (6/21) it was seen right by Fisherman's Wharf and was sighted again today (6/22) just off Victoria.
