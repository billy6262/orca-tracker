Orca Sightings for June 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hugh McIsaac called Orca Network to report seeing
3 - 4 orcas 5 miles south of Point Sur, CA
. They were out about 3.5 - 4 miles, and heading north.
*
Today reports were of
J, K, and part of L- Pod
spread out several miles from the north to south end of
San Juan Island
. The family of L-22 Spirit, with teenage males L-85 Mystery, L-87 Onyx, L-89 Solstice, and L-79 Skana, along with L-12 Alexis seemed to be hunting for salmon until they reached the end of Salmon Bank and turned back toward the northwest. L-12 Alexis doesn't travel with this family regularly, but her grandchildren and great grandchildren have been seen with J-Pod lately, so perhaps the estimated 77 year old matriarch was enjoying a respite?! The pods have been mixing it up, challenging us to identify who is spending time with who!

We had an adventure out to
Swiftsure Bank
(west end of Strait of Juan de Fuca) yesterday (about 110 nautical miles each way), and amongst the 12-14' swells (so big you lost sight of land!) we found
6 humpbacks
!!!

This evening's sunset tour was quiet the safari! The adventure started with the misty blows of
orca whales off Spieden Island
. As we approached them we were able to identify a few members of
Jpod
, including the impressive adult male "Ruffles", 100-year old "Granny", and "Blackberry". They traveled in a large closely knit pod, with at least eight other orcas. They swam along the backside of Spieden towards Turn Point on Stuart Island. The orcas became quite lively while heading over Boundary Pass, breaching, tail slapping, cartwheeling, and spy hopping. The crowd cheered at the thrill of seeing such playful behavior in their natural environment. It was difficult to leave the orcas, however we quickly spotted
dall's porpoises
as we returned home.

After such an amazing day filled with members of
all three pods
in tight groups, close passes in the kelp at the lighthouse and lots of resting lines, at

7:00pm
a lone
humpback whale
headed north off the west side of
San Juan Island
approx 200 yards from shore, the blows highlighted by the sun. What an awesome day in the islands!!!

We arrived on San Juan Island for Howard to do a talk at the Whale Museum. I headed out to the west side, just missed the
So. Residents
at the Center for Whale Research at about

11:30 am
(they'd been heading N but turned back S just before I got there), so I headed down island to
Hannah Heights
, where at noon I saw two orcas just south of me, heading south (likely the tail end of a larger group) - it looked like a male/sprouter and a female. At
12:15 I saw 6 - 8 orcas heading N around Pt. Edwards, including 2 males, 3-5 females and a calf. At
12:25 3 - 4 orcas heading south, doing some milling - the male looked like J1.
12:33, J1, a female and a calf were then headed N. Another 4 orcas, including 1 male also headed N. At
12:40, what looked like some J pod groups were milling off Pt. Edwards, and some Whale Watch boats were further south toward False Bay, where another group of orcas were. At 1250, 6 or 7 orcas were in a resting line heading N off Pt. Edwards, and another 2 - 3 still milling just S of Edwards Pt.
