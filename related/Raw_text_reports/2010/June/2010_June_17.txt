Orca Sightings for June 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a great day of watching
Js and Ks
from
Hannah Heights
, W San Juan Island. At

12:45 pm
they were heading south with some milling, foraging & porpoising. IDs included
K21 & K40, J22, J34, J14, J30, J38
. At

1:25 pm
several small groups were heading south including 2 females with calves, again foraging & porpoising. At approx.
3:30 pm small groups of So. Residents were close in milling and foraging off Pile Pt, heading north, reaching Hannah Heights at around 4 pm. 2 large males, several juveniles and females and a sprouter were observed, spread out in small groups foraging. At
4:15 pm a male and several females headed south.
4:30 pm 2 females and 1 male headed north, a few minutes later 3 females and 1 male headed south, then 2 males and 1 female headed north, 1 went south, and ~5 others headed north (are we dizzy yet?!).

6:40 pm
members of
J pod
headed south past Hannah Heights. J1 and J2 were photographed at Lime Kiln around
5:45 pm (see above photo of J2) , remarkable as they were observed and photographed off Anacortes at
1:45 pm! And to top off the day, as we watched a beautiful sunset, the whales started heading by Hannah Heights going south again, around
8:30 or 9 pm.

Began hearing faint chatter at
Lime Kiln hydrophone
5:40 pm
. Must have been the tail end of group traveling as all I can hear is water at
6:15 pm. If only there were an under water camera.

West Side

We definitely had
J-1 and J-2
, also J-30 but couldn't positively ID the females. There were perhaps 12-15 whales total. We found them just off
Washington Park in Anacortes
, around

11:20 am
, heading south - and after a side trip under the Deception Pass bridge, ultimately left them in roughly the same vicinity around
1:45 or so. It looked like they may have been heading towards Lopez when we left, but they were very spread out.

We received several 2nd hand reports on Facebook that
L pod
was sighted in
Johnstone Strait
, and found this on Mackay's Whale watch Facebook page, with many photos that definitely confirm many members of L pod up north!
The second and last day with our tour group. This day we went to Nakwakto rapids a place where Belize and Seymour Inlet pour into a small gap creating fast moving rapids. We also saw a raft of kelp grizzlies (Sea otters!), a haul out of Northern sea lions, one humpback whale, 300 + pacific white sides and last but not least --- 20 or so Southern Resident Killer Whales from the "L" pod!

A pod of
Orcas
were seen swimming off
Edmonds
around
1pm
.
Norm Mah, KOMO TV News
After viewing the video on KOMO TV, Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research and Candi Emmons of NOAA Fisheries concur these are
Transient orcas
, the
T65As
. Dave thinks there is an extra juvenile that has the fin shape of T36A1 too.

Orca Network received a call from Susan Bullerdick, who reported a small pod of
orcas
seen from the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
at about

7:45 am
. The orcas were heading north, looking like they were going to head up Saratoga Passage.

Thursday Morning

7:30 am
crossing from
Clinton to Mukilteo
my husband and boys report the ferry slowed down to let at least
3 orcas
pass (about midway).
