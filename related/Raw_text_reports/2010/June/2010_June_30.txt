Orca Sightings for June 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The water looked like glass tonight as we headed out of Friday Harbor in search of the Orcas. Earlier on the afternoon trip we observed
K pod
just outside of Cattle pass slowly traveling north on the west side of
San Juan Island
but this evening there were new reports of [
orcas
] even closer by. We quickly caught up to them as they traveled along
Stuart Island
. After only a moment of observing this pod I saw that familiar wavy dorsal fin pop up and knew we were in the presence of J-pod. 'Ruffles' one of the adult males has an unmistakable wavy trailing edge to his dorsal fin. The whales traveled along slowly in a tight knit group but a quick glance ahead revealed that there were more whales to be seen. After reaching turn point (the most northwestern point in the United States) they became a little more active and we were lucky enough to see several breaches, tail lobbing and a cartwheel or two before heading back home.
