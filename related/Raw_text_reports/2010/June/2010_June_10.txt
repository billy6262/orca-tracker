This post shows the whereabouts of 4 K pod whales with J pod - whales were reported at
Thatcher Pass
and a few hours later whales were reported at
Eagle Pt.
The Eagle Pt. whales passed by
Lime Kiln
, got to County Park and turned back and went south. Members of the
K11s, K14s, and K12s
were seen including new calf
K43
. The Thatcher Pass whales were
J Pod
with 4 K pod whales.
K21, K40, K16 and K35
. Members of all J Pod family groups were present and it appeared they were once again back together. J Pod and the 4 K pod whales were last seen at
7pm
in the Straits of Georgia, spread out and foraging.

We saw
three female [orcas] and a calf
in the
Yaquina Bay, Newport, OR
. We lost them for a while as they were swimming upriver passing the Hatfield Marine Science Center. After about an hour and a half they came back into the bay and headed off to open waters. Almost exactly one year ago, on
June 9, 2009, I observed a group of orcas off of Depoe Bay and north of Newport traveling south (I sent you photos of the sighting last year).
Julia Hager, Newport, OR
ID on Newport Orcas: Julia's photos were sent to our list of researchers, and so far we have this reply from Jared Towers of Canada's DFO: The animal in frame 101 looks like T075B. Beyond that I can't say much with out a lot of guessing.
*
As a follow up to Julia's report, it seems the [
orca
] pod consisted of 6 animals, including 2 calves. They spent approximately 2 hours in
Yaquina Bay OR
, traveling about 5.5 miles up river before heading back downstream as the tide began to flood. They appeared rather active throughout, displaying some breaches and tail lobbing, but we had no direct observations of predation on pinnipeds.
