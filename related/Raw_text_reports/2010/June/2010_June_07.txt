Orca Sightings for June 7, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
8 AM, Edmonds, WA
ferry dock,
gray whale
feeding, rolling, blowing as crew and passengers on the deck watched this special sight!
Joan Douglas, Edmonds, WA

3:30 pm spotted at least two pairs of
Harbor Porpoise
, sighted from
Edmonds
Beach park south of the marina. First we both saw a large splash ( like a breach splash) south of the ferry lane across towards Kingston, then noticed one fin. Saw a couple more fin surfaces further south. Not certain if the same animal but the splash had us intrigued as we have not ourselves seen that before with the Harbor porpoise. Closer to us, 500 yards from the beach, a pair surfaced a few times heading south. Shortly after spotted another (or first ) pair across mid channel south of ferry lane heading south.

hmm - wonder if the "splashing" porpoise
may have been Dall's
rather than Harbor porpoise? Dall's are known to often have a characteristic "rooster tail" splash while porpoising out of the water - sb

We were lucky to see about
8 Orcas
at

8:30am
as they moved past our home (near Rocky Point, North
Nanaimo
) heading north. They were definitely feeding as they circled around a couple of times, and were moving very fast.

Our guess is this was likely one of the groups of Transient orcas sighted in this area the past few days - S

We had
J-pod
between
Hornby and Denman Island, BC
,
6pm-7pm
.

We eventually found some
L Pod
whales in the southern
Strait of Georgia
, just east of of East Point, Saturna Island. These whales, the
L12's
, appeared to be resting in the very calm waters. We observed L94 with little L113 beside her. The old girls,
L25 and L12
, were both there, as well as L41. A little further ahead - more whales. The trailing group of J pod consisted of the J17's and J22's. Both little calves, J46 and J47, were seen with their moms (see above photo). This group also appeared to be resting. As we entered into Boundary Pass, a freighter in the shipping lanes threw quite a wake. Several J Pod whales were traveling very close to the Saturna Island shoreline when the wake caught up to them. Some of the whales surfed the wave, some breached. We left the whales traveling slowly westbound, against a weak flood tide.

The whales were traveling down from the north.
J27, J31 and J39
were still with
L41,L25,L94,L113, and L77
. They reached Turn Pt. at
4 pm
and
Lime Kiln
at

5:30pm
. J Pod was leading and they were closer to the shore, with the other two L pod groups who were behind and a couple miles off shore (same grouping as the prior day).
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island

At least seven
Killer Whales
, in two groups (4 and 3+) including one large bull, were traveling north-east in the
Strait of Georgia
at
7.20am
, seen from the BC Ferries Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay 7am sailing, approx. 15 minutes out of dock. The animals all appeared to be traveling slowly and / or feeding.

A short jaunt over to
Saturna Island
and we were viewing
Orcas
. Once again widely spread in clusters of groups we encountered the
J and L pods
. There were a few splashes but mostly the whales slowly traveled along. No matter how many times I view these animals it never ceases to amaze me when they all come up to surface at once making for a picture perfect moment.

Both this morning (at
530 am
) and this afternoon (at
400 pm
), there was
a grey whale
swimming near the
Edmonds ferry terminal
. The whale was surfacing regularly and didn't seem to want to leave the area between the ferry dock and marina. A bald eagle was repeatedly swooping over the top of the whale just above the water.

Probably heard that there has been a mother and baby
grey whale
hanging around the
edmonds ferry dock
pretty much all day

Not sure if other folks have heard about this or not, but i just got word about an hour ago via FaceBook that there's a
"gray whale
struggling near the
Edmonds Ferry dock
...."

Around

8:30am
, we noticed a whale in the waters between the fishing marina and the
Edmonds ferry dock
. It appears to be
a Gray Whale
from what we can tell. It has been swimming around in a big circle, sometimes on its side. Don't have much more to offer than that.

Laurie Baker, Operations Supervisor for WA State Ferries, reported that the captain of the ferry Puyallup saw
a gray whale
near the
Edmonds ferry dock
at

5:35 AM
. The ferry waited for the whale to move away before docking.
*
Joan Douglas of Snohomish Beach Watchers reported
a gray whale
at the north side of the
Edmonds ferry dock
.
*
Norm at KOMO TV called to check out rumors of
a gray whale
in trouble or giving birth at the
Edmonds ferry dock
. The circling and rolling on its side in shallow water is, however, normal feeding behavior. Whether it is finding much food is not known.
*
Rebecca Timothy called to report
a gray whale
swimming close to the beach at

5:20 AM
in
Crescent Harbor, near Oak Harbor
, Whidbey Island.
*
Charmain Lander called Orca Network to report
a gray whale
in
Crescent Harbor
, circling and rolling on its side in shallow water.
