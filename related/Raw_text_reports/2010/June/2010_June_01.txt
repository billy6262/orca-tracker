Orca Sightings for June 1, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
This morning we got reports of whales way up by Pender Island heading North towards Active Pass. As we approached Navy Channel we had heard that
J-pod
which has 28 animals had split into two groups. The main group went through
Active Pass
and was
entering Georgia Strait
heading towards Vancouver as the smaller group of 13 animals including
4 J-22's, 6 J-17's and 3 J-11's
turned right at Navy Channel and headed East towards Saturna Island. The six J-17 whales were really playful with lots of breaches and tail flips. Great vocalizations were heard throughout the entire tour. During my 16 years as a whale watching captain here in Victoria, I have only seen the Resident Whales go through this channel a handful of times !!!!! Just before we left the scene, the whales did an amazing turn as they went North past Lizard and Curlew Island towards
Georgeson Pass
. Absolutely amazing to see J-pod go through this narrow little passage to get back out into Georgia Strait. Never seen this one before.

We had heard that J-pod was already going through
Active Pass
We then received news that part of J-pod had turned south and was heading south in Navy Channel. This was something I had never heard of before. Over the radio we continued to get reports that they were heading south, now into Plumper Sound. Next the news was that they had turned NE and were going through the pass just south of
Georgeson Island
! As far as I know this is a first for the Southern Residents to travel through these areas (some fairly narrow and shallow passages) in the Gulf Islands. We arrived on scene around

1:30pm
, just after they entered the Strait of Georgia. They spread out quickly and started to forage. We saw two belly flop breaches, heard vocalizations over the Hydrophone, and had a wonderful encounter with J-27 Blackberry along with a few other members of J-pod.

7:45 am...J Pod
on the
hydrophones
, most likely going north. We find part of J pod headed east in
Navy Ch
., between N. Pender and Maynes Islands, BC. East? I've never seen them do anything in Navy Ch. Only a couple of the most experienced captains have seen them there. Then they turn north and start going up
Georgeson Pass
, a narrow channel that connects Navy Ch. with the Strait of Georgia. I know of no one who has ever seen Orcas in this pass, until today. To many, this might seem mundane. To myself and my fellow captains, it was a sight we have never seen before and it was amazing! This picture may be the only one in existence of a breach in this particular spot of the pass. We also saw the
L12s on the West Side
this
afternoon
.

Erick Pierson reported that
L pod
came in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
this
afternoon
and spread out off the west side of San Juan Island. Orca calls were resounding on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
after
5 pm
.

Scott Veirs sent this report: On the Lime Kiln hydrophones at
1450
, despite a lot of ship noise from passing freighter and tanker/tug, starting to hear
calls on Lime Kiln hydrophone
.
L pod
was reported at
Hannah Heights
northbound at

14:30
. Also, J pod may be southbound from Boundary Pass area, so listen to Orcasound hydrophone as well.

1:10 pm
: Capt. Jim Maya was with 13 members of
J pod
, mostly younger ones, traveling through
Georgeson Pass
, just south of Active Pass, where the rest of J pod passed through about two hours earlier. There was a rumor of T's further north near Gabriola Island.
*
Reports were in early of the southern resident
J pod
sightings around
Active pass
. Although they were spread out we did get some close looks at an adult male and two sets of female/calf pairs. It was such a peaceful day on the water we could hear the blows of the whales as they surfaced to breath.

8-9 killer whales
reported off
