Orca Sightings for June 27, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After watching whales pass the house (Center for Whale Research) Ken Balcomb, Emma Foster and Astrid van Ginneken departed from snug and immediately encountered whales off
Kellet Bluff
(48째 59.378 N; 123째 20.358 W) at

6:03 p.m
. We saw several groups of
L-pod
whales engaging in very social behavior. During the evening we saw L26, L90, L92, L95, L72, L105, L55, L86, L106, L27, L82, L103, L109, L47, L83, L110 and L91. Finally we finished our encounter north of Turn Point (48째 70.798 N; 123째 24.364 W) at
8:03 p.m. with the L12s and a few spectacular breaches from a couple of the males.

As a volunteer at
Lime Kiln
, I was down at the whale watching area (rock wall) explaining to the tourists who they were looking at -- some of
L pod
were in very, very close to the rocks giving a great show. At one point a male just floats on the surface, keeping himself in one place, looking. Then all of a sudden he raised his head and let out two calls, splashed his tail still floating in place and then sunk straight down under again. Everyone at the observation point heard those calls. Very cool and my first time hearing calls in the open air, not via the hydrophones!

4:30 pm.
The
L-12s
came in late on Saturday night, but little did I know many other L pod whales would show up on the west side Sunday afternoon. When they passed by at
Lime Kiln Pt. State Park
, members of the
L4s, L26s, L21s, L12s
(10 of them - not L87 he travels with K pod), L7s and L43s, were seen. More of the story and pictures on my blog.

As I was awaiting for what I thought would be their return from the Fraser River heading south some of
K pod
approached
Pt. Roberts
Lighthouse Marine Park heading north. Wow! they spent over 12 hours in this critical habitat. My previously recorded maximum time was seven hours. The first orca seen was Raggedy "
K40
". She and others were moving slow. There were groups of three and four doing some foraging. A male did a speed turn to get a salmon right off the dock pilings that is a favourite spot for them to grab a fish or two. One orca logged close to shore for about 4 minutes. They like it here when it is quiet. Four seals grouped together and came close to shore but didn't have to worry about these residents since only transients may eat them. A few hours later reports were that these one were at the South Arm of the Fraser River while there was another group at the North Arm. I had expected that some would be passing Point Roberts later but hopes were fading when it looked like they were heading to Active Pass to head back to San Juan Islands. However, this large group of Js and some Ks turned to head north to the Tsawwassen Coal Docks. So is this going to be a return to the Fraser River? Nope they decided to follow the orcas that I was photographing who were off already off the park heading south. It looked like "Granny" J2 was in this group (I still have to check all my ID photos). One baby did four consecutive breaches. About two hours later the second group with the Js and some Ks approached. One adult did a couple of lunges with the massive body completely out of the water. At the end two J babies starting breaching. Land based whale watchers were thrilled. Within 100 yards the orcas grouped up, tail slapped, and breached as the rain stopped and the sun lighted the adventures of both orcas and people. Nature can be predictable in that they will be unpredictable.

There are some great

Lime Kiln hydrophone

From
Pender Island, B.C.
:
Tonight
, around
25 orcas
came by. We saw flukes & 1 breach. It's a calm night & we could hear their breaths before seeing them in front of the house. Some were close in, some were about 1/3 of the way across Swanson Channel towards Portland Island. After most had passed by, around 10-11 of them turned back & went south again towards Thieves Bay. A wonderful evening, & the icing on the cake was a flamboyant sunset.

We just came back from
Lime Kiln Point State Park
on San Juan Island, where a group of
Orcas
was passing by at around
5 p.m.
, heading north. It was amazing, they came really close to the rocks and some were breaching.

Was listening for whales all day on the hydrophone, when I heard a few quiet squeaks this afternoon and headed to the west side (
San Juan Isl
). We missed the main group that headed north, but the L12's were not far behind and VERY close to shore. Lots of breaches, and cartwheels! Amazing time! I'm guessing this was at
4pm
on Sunday.

J27, J28
and others including two calves, one of which was J46, at Point Grey today! We had 7 members of
J pod
who were trailing far behind the rest of the pod who was near the coal port. They were doing a lot of foraging followed by breaching and spyhops. Here is a picture of one of the calves and another picture of a spyhop.

Erick Peirson reported
J pod
and some
Ks
milling off
False Bay, San Juan Island
at

3:30 pm
, with some of
L pod
up at
Salmon Bank
.

The 12.15 pm Ocean Magic out of Victoria headed deep south toward Whidbey Island, where we found several members of
L pod
, that were slowly foraging in wide circles and then traveling leisurely north, one by one.
L 12
, Alexis, with her two nicks in her dorsal fin was identified as was
L 79
who surprised us on board with two enormous breaches. Two other males were seen off in the distance but not identified. Conditions were excellent for viewing today with no wind and flat calm water. An awesome encounter with Skana, L 79.

Rudy Deck of Whidbey Island called at

12:40 pm
to report the
orcas
off
NW Whidbey
were about 5 miles SW of Smith Island - he could just make out some fins and tails, and the Victoria Clipper passengers were getting a good look at them!
*
Erick Peirson called to report
So. Resident Orcas
milling and foraging at
Partridge Bank
, from

10:30 -
11:30 am
, including
L41
.
*
Bev Wenthin of Whidbey Island called to report seeing 2 either large
porpoise or small orcas
heading south off
Bush Pt
. at

12:45 pm
. They were black and white, but she didn't see spouts, and they looked a bit small for orcas, so possibly Dall's porpoise?
*
The same [
orcas
] reported in Monterey the day before yesterday (6/25) were still here yesterday (6/26) and today (6/27), but it looks like they were with another pod as well this
afternoon
. They were pretty playful, and one male was showing off his "assets".

re: Kate's photos: I was also there the last 3 days they have been here so have photos. These are the 122's.
Nancy Black of Monterey Bay Whale Watch
These are the whales that were tagged (2 of them) in April. They were the CA51s (5 whales) and the CA138s (three whales, including a young calf), as well as CA171's juvenile male. These same whales were photographed last Tuesday (6/22) afternoon around
1:30 pm off the Los Angeles area, headed north.

Greetings from
Sechelt Sunshine Coast BC
.
June 25th had a
gray whale
off Davis Bay feeding around

5:00pm
. The lonely whale was spotted the night before at Gibsons also feeding along shore line and then on morning of 25th had moved further up coast to Mission Point where it was feeding close in, in kelp beds. Moved up to Davis Bay Sechelt and collected several hundred watchers along highway watching the whale in close. It proceeded further up coast and away from shore. Last seen heading to middle of straight. This morning (6/27) it was again seen off Roberts Creek on the Sunshine Coast feeding for about an hour. Lots of people saw the whale with cameras but we're sending this just in case. keep up the good work
Don & Cornelia, Sechelt BC
