Orca Sightings for November 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

5:50pm
Marian Fuller called from
Kingston
to report at least six
orcas
headed south past Eglon Beach, headed to Apple Tree Cove. Four were close to the beach and two more were out in the shipping lane.
*
I was still hearing
calls
on the hydrophones at

6:45a.m.
As soon as it got light I went looking but could not find the whales. At
8:45 a.m. I was still hearing calls, faint. I went out on the Western Explorer zodiac and we located the whales at the southern end of Eastern Bank at

11:20
. They were spread for miles and slowly heading south toward Puget Sound. Here is who I identified: J-8, J-16, J-22, J-26, J-27, J-28, J-31, J-32, J-34, J-37, J-38, J-39, J-42, J-46, K-13, K-20, K-33, K-25, K22, L-27, L-78, L-83, L-86, L-95, L-105, L-106, L-110, L-112. We left the whales at

12:49
with Ft. Flagler lighthouse in one direction and a submarine in the other. See my blog for more about the trip. Thanks!

After receiving word from the Center for Whale Research that the Southern Residents were heading into Admiralty Inlet at
1 pm
, we got the word out and gathered our gear and headed for the boat. We departed
Lagoon Pt.
at
1355
, and within 5 or 10 minutes found the orcas spread out in small groups scattered across
Admiralty Inlet
. We initially saw some J pod whales, and noted other small groups in the distance in front of Admiralty Head, Port Townsend, and south of Lagoon Pt. We began the ordeal of trying to get ID photos of each group, difficult when they are spread out so far! By 1440 the leaders were off Bush Pt. At 1500 we noticed increased Coast Guard activity on the water and spied a sub coming in. At 1507 we could see the leaders spouting near Hansville, heading south toward Pt. No Point, while others were north of Double Bluff on the Whidbey side. At 1611 we had J1 off Double Bluff - he had been foraging and as he passed by we both picked up a distinct poop odor, and were hoping to score a scat sample but unfortunately couldn't find it while it was still afloat (time to get Sweet Pea trained to be our poop sniffing dog!). At 1635 we left the whales as the trailers approached Point No Point (NE Kitsap Peninsula), hdg SE in small groups spread out over several miles. We are still going over our photographs, but so far have IDd whales from all three pods, including: J1, J8, J16, J19, J22, J26, J30, J34, J42, K14, K22, K26, K36, K42, and L88 and L92.

Following the 'Orca call' at
1.20 pm
that whales were off
Port Townsend
Marine Science Center, I watched numerous well spread out Southern Residents pass by
Bush Point
between
2.30 pm and 3.30 pm
. Most were traveling steadily south although I saw occasional foraging, a couple of breaches, a lobtail or two and a nursing Mum waiting patiently for the little one to feed. The whales were too far out for good photos, but some may help ON to ID some of the trailers while they (Susan and Howard) were trying to cover those 'up front'.

I was out kayaking today at Bush Point and ran into Sandra Pollard who said there were reports of
Orcas
from Port Townsend and that she thought she saw your boat go past, but at that moment we didn't see any so I decided to pull over at the other public access on the other side of the restaurant and started to see some out pretty far and then everywhere!! Some quite close to Bush Point - I was over the moon as this was my first sighting in the wild - I have only lived here for ten years! They just kept coming by and I could see you guys out there getting such a show! Then I drove down to Wahl Rd and saw you (I think) and the show went on - they were a bit further out but there were times when I couldn't see your boat because they were all around you! What a day you must have had just extraordinary! You must have amazing shots if your lens wasn't covered in mist from them blowing all over you. I saw a great breach right near your boat from Bush Point.

I live in
Lagoon Point
on Whidbey Island west side and today there were multitudes of whales heading south. The parade lasted for over half an hour and there were at least 25 (probably many more) of different sizes. Incredible sight! I am not knowledgeable about pods etc but there certainly seemed to be a lot of them stretched out across the water for as far as the eye could see.
