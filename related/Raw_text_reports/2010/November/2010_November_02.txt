Orca Sightings for November 2, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After having left the area for over a week, the Center staff received word that the
Southern Residents
were once again inbound from the Strait of Juan de Fuca today. Excited to see them again, Dave Ellifrit and Debbie Sharpe took Shachi out and encountered the leaders just off
Lime Kiln State Park
at
1343
. There was lots of milling and some obvious signs of successful fishing. As the day progressed, the residents eventually started converging into larger, tighter groups and we finally departed the whales at
1751
off Kellett, just after a beautiful sunset. It was nice to see so many whales present and to see that our Southern Resident calves seem to all be doing well.

The waters were flat calm, and then I get a message from my buddy Ron (thanks!) that
Residents
were seen around
Pile Point
. I began hearing very clear calls on Lime Kiln so I knew they were coming this way! So it took very little coaxing to get my wife to abandon the paint brushes and ladders and we jumped into our boat and were going to head south. BUT --- whales were already approaching Open Bay, so we were more than content to just shut down the boat and enjoy the peace and quiet, listening to the chuffing sounds of orcas milling about. First we were able to ID J34 Doublestuff, and he is getting big! Then the distinctive sound of J8 Speiden. We saw Ruffles off in the distance heading towards the western side of Haro Strait. Then J26 Mike gave us a start as he surfaced after a 9 minute dive. Shortly afterwards while we were distracted by another whale, Mike decided to show off an breached about 100 yards behind us--we saw the tail end and a humongous splash! We were so relaxed as small groups of whales continued heading towards Kellet Bluff, only to turn and mill back south, and then continue on northward. The sun was waning and we were thinking it was time to make the very short run from Kellet back to Snug Harbor when we heard many blows coming towards us. We looked, and were treated to a rollicking group of about 10-12 L Pod whales (and J30 Riptide too) passing about 130 yards from us. We were so excited-- this group was definitely in socializing mode!!! As they approached, they began rolling on the surface and began to vocalize quite loudly for about 20 seconds. Lots of squeals and even a few razberries! This group was so tactile, rubbing on each other and we saw several "sea snakes"! The cherry on the top of the experiences was to see not one, not two, but THREE orcas spyhopping simultaneously!!! We left the whales about 1730 hours at Kellet Bluff, with most of the whales continuing north.

all three Southern Resident pods
slowly head north from Land Bank on the west side of

No word when we left the dock on Orcas, then we heard about a few Transients, then they turned into
Residents
. Calm seas, sunny, lots and lots of Orcas - What a day! We left them at

2:00

Lime Kiln Lighthouse
, heading north. The last ones went by the lighthouse about an hour ago (~

4:15 pm
).
