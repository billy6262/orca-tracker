Orca Sightings for November 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Approx

4:10 PM
: On the Southworth to Fauntleroy (
West Seattle
) Ferry, just past Vashon Island. Many [
orcas
], males, females, and juveniles, by the look of it. I'm assuming this is J-Pod as I saw a whale that looked like photos I've seen of J1 (Ruffles). There were 2 or 3 whales on the surface at any given time and I even saw one breech fully out of the water off towards the Alki Lighthouse. (feeding on salmon?) The pod looked to be moving basically south westward, towards the break between Blake Island and Vashon.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called to report that he and other NOAA researchers met up with the
So. Resident orcas
in the
Seattle
area today around 11 am, following them south until they got to Three Tree Pt, where they did a 180 degree turn and headed north. They identified J and K pods, plus L87. They left them late afternoon, still traveling north, just south of Dolphin Pt, NE Vashon Island, and wondering if they might go around the north tip of Vashon and down into Colvos Passage - which they apparently did (see above report).

Amy Carey called Orca Network with the following reports and updates of the
So. Resident orcas
in Puget Sound today:
At

she had the orcas off the north end of
Vashon Island
, heading south.

11:45 am
: the orcas were approaching
Dilworth
(NE side of Vashon Island), heading south. She is sure they are Southern Residents, may have seen J1 but still too distant to ID.

J, K and L pods
present.
A little before
