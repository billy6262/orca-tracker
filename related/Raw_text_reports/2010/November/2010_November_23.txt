Orca Network received a call from Mary Butler, reporting a sighting of an
unknown whale species
(but not an orca) from
Mendocino, CA
. They saw the whale from a bluff at Headlands State Park. She said it was about 20' long, in a small cove below them, just below the surface. It didn't dive or surface enough to see any pec fins or flukes, so they weren't able to tell what kind of whale it was. As they watched it appeared to be heading out of the cove toward the open ocean.
