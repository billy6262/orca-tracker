============================================================

Entry 1:
Heard from Jeff Lamarche via Facebook: We had
J's & K's
plus
one Humpback
off
Constance Bank
yesterday
afternoon
(11/21).
Jim Maya, Maya's Charters, San Juan Island, WA

I spotted what turned out to be
J's, K's, and L87
south of
Victoria
in the morning. They were foraging throughout the area all day. There was also one
humpback
seen in the area of
Constance Bank
, south of Victoria, B.C. (BCX1057).
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria, B.C.

A
humpback
was sighted outside
Telegraph Cove, B.C.
Thanks to this community's remarkable volunteer efforts, we were able to ID the whale as "Arial" (BCY0767 and in fact know that Arial is Houdini's (BCX0022) 5th known calf, born in 2007. Note that the ID could be determined from the following flank shot. We are fortunate that, with the work of the past 7 years, we know the humpbacks that well.
