Orca Sightings for November 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Brad Hanson and Candice Emmons of NOAA Fisheries NWFSC updated us with their whale encounter in
Admiralty Inlet
: The
orcas
were still heading up Admiralty, they left them at

3:50 pm
off Double Bluff, but they were not going anywhere fast. They IDd many Js and Ks, but they were spread out all over the place making it difficult to find and ID them all. They were able to collect five samples during the day: 3 prey samples, 1 fecal sample, and 1 possible regurgitation sample.
*
The
orcas
were off the
Eglon beach
by my house about
1215 pm
. There were about 8 or 9 that I could count. There are a ton of salmon out there. I saw an Eagle grab a huge one out of the water yesterday around the Orcas.

I'm in Hansville on Skunk Bay, just wanted to report and pod of
Orcas
feeding off the west end of
Double Bluff
north of the shipping lanes at

3:30 pm
. We're watching through binoculars. One large male and it looks like 3 or 4 females. Going back and forth, some tail slaps. Looks like maybe a research vessel that may be scooping whale poop -- just a guess , it's staying well away from the pod.

I went out to the SW side of Whidbey in an attempt to find the rest of the spread out groups of Southern Residents to assist NOAA Fisheries in their attempts to collect samples. I first saw a few fins in the far distance, between
Double Bluff and Pt. No Point
, mid-channel at
2 pm
, and Brad was with this group. I only saw 1 - 2 additional orcas from my vantage point at Mutiny Bay, they were closer to the Double Bluff side of the channel. I also saw 1 Steller sea lion in N. Mutiny Bay at 2 pm and another in S. Mutiny Bay at
2:30 pm. I headed further south, and finally saw a few more fins and spouts at

2:50 pm
from
Double Bluff
- they were just coming up to Point No Point from the south. There were ~4 orcas in this group, including 1 very large male with a J1 shaped fin but were way too far for positive IDs or photos. I watched as they passed Pt. No Point, and saw a breach over by Hansville. I looked for more whales further north and south, but the rain and darkness prevented me from seeing any other fins out there today.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries called and said they found a small group of ~6
So. Residents
spread out and traveling east off Point No Point at

12:38 pm
. By 1 pm he determined they were heading NW into
Admiralty Inlet
. They followed them and were successful collecting several fish scale samples and a possible regurgitation sample. They found a few more scattered groups - mainly around the Pt. No Point area over the course of the next few hours, with some milling but main direction of travel seemed to be NW up Admiralty Inlet.

At

12:45 pm
Alisa Brooks called again, and said after losing sight of the [
orcas
] for a few hours, she finally saw the big splash of a breach over by
Point No Point
, and was able to see a few spouts as well.
*
South of the Eglon (mid-way
between Pt. No Point & Kingston
, Kitsap Peninsula) boat ramp we sighted
at least 10 orcas
going north at

12:00 PM.
They were about 500 yards off shore and some were out in the south bound shipping lanes. There is at least one male and looks like a small one.

We just moved to a house on Picnic Point in
Edmonds
and had our first
Orca
sighting this morning about

10:30
.
Kelly Graves, Edmonds, WA

Alisa Brooks called at

10:05 am
, with a report of
orcas
south of the
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes
, and moving west, closer to the Whidbey side.
*
Tom Dennis, 1st officer on the
Mukilteo-Clinton ferry
called us again this morning at

8:44 am
with a report of a large display of
orcas
, spread out and milling in the vicinity of the ferry lane.
*
Veronica von Allworden of Langley called to relay a report from her husband Eric, who at was on the
Mukilteo/Clinton Ferry
this morning and said at

8:30 am
the ferry had to stop while in the midst of lots of orcas, including 4 or 5 males, breaching and lob-tailing around the halted ferry. They were moving slowly south, toward Possession Point.
*
When I came across the water (
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry run
) this morning on the
7 am
crossing, I saw something in the water off in the distance toward the south end of Whidbey that I suspected were orcas but I wasn't sure. Now I know it wasn't just wishful thinking.
