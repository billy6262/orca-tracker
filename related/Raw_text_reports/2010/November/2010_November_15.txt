Orca Sightings for November 15, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Karl and Kim Bruder spotted the
Transients
near
Speiden Island
. Debbie Sharpe (Center for Whale Research) called to report seeing transients
T72, T99, T99A, T99B, AND T99C and then we had T36, T36A, T36B, and her calf, T36B1
off Speiden Island, from

2:45pm
to just before
4 pm
. T36A does have a calf, but when Dave was in Alaska he found that it seemed to be swimming with a different pod now! She was with Jim Maya, Jeanne Hyde, and Dave Ellifrit.
*
Jim Maya called at

3:28 pm
to say they were with a pod of
Transients
just south of Sentinel Island, in
Speiden Channel
(48 38 245N; 123 08 929W). They were feeding on a Steller sea lion kill, and slowly drifting west.
*
Whales (
orcas
) westbound,
Spieden Channel 1410
. My guess is Transient's Maya and Jeanne on the way.

Orca Network received a call from Mike Waitt, just south of Lagoon Pt, Whidbey Island, reporting a pod of
orcas
(at least 6) heading slowly north in
Admiralty Inlet
, quite a ways out, and about 1/4 mile north of the south tip of Marrowstone Island at

2:50 pm
.
