Orca Sightings for November 3, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
It is always so nice to capture a pic of one of my favourite species of whale with Mt. Baker as a backdrop. That is exactly what occurred around
1pm
while on the Ocean Magic trip out of Victoria, BC. We had
7 Humpback whales
sighted in a three hour trip just east of
Race Rocks
. Now that is something to smile about. The 7 seemed to be mostly whales we had observed over the past 6 weeks or so. Split- Fin, Split -Fluke were there as well as Heather, and what appears to be her 2010 calf since it is always at her side. Sunny days are a welcome bonus in the month of November along with the whales.
