Orca Sightings for November 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
About

12:15 pm
, on the
Clinton to Mukilteo ferry
run just after noon (Saratoga Passage, S of Gedney Island),
several Orcas
were seen on both sides of the ferry. I personally saw about 4 to 6 from the south side of the ferry; and I got the impression there were more than just a couple on the north side. One swam directly across from my car window (on the lower deck) about 20 feet from the side of the boat. They appeared to be just playing around. The dark dorsal fins seemed to stay in the same area. Appreciate getting your whale report.

I picked up the
T185's
in the afternoon south-east of
Race Rocks
. I left them at
1540
pointing west after snacking on a probable seal.

Thanks to Ed's report, we grabbed our gear and headed out to find the
orcas
from the
east side of Whidbey Island
. We drove to East Pt and saw orcas immediately, just reaching East Pt/Fox Spit (just SE of the entrance to Holmes Harbor), heading NW up Saratoga Passage at

3:35 pm
. They were VERY spread out, foraging between the south end of Camano Island/Langley, up to North Bluff/Camano Island State Park - they were all going different directions, traveling in small groups, but main travel was to the NW. We saw 5 - 6 adult males, at least 1 juvenile, and a total of about 20 - 30 orcas. We left at about
4:45 pm, as most the whales were reaching the Greenbank/Elger Bay area, however some were still bouncing around further south down Saratoga Passage, so difficult to get an accurate count. A few of the IDs of the orcas we photographed in Saratoga Passage last Wednesday have been confirmed by the Center for Whale Research as
K26, K16, K21, and J26
. It's been several years since we've had the Southern Residents head up Saratoga Passage. Ray Fryberg of Tulalip Dept. of Fish and Wildlife said they had a strong chum salmon run this year, so maybe that's what they were after.

At least a half-dozen or so
black-fish
cavorting just off East-Point (Whidbey Island -
Saratoga Passage
) just now -

3:30 pm
- mid-channel. Some going West - most going East. Looks like they're grazing for some tasty Chinook --or Harbor Seals (depending on their familial persuasion---).

Orca Network received a call from Ed Young of Whidbey Island Kayaks, reporting
4 orcas
, including 1 male, off
Langley
, SE Whidbey Island, heading NW up Saratoga Passage.

11:30 am
ferry.
Orcas
(3 or 4) were off to the left of the ferry dock and then out in the middle as ferry traveled toward
Mukilteo
. They were surfacing or showing tails most of the trip.

Tom Dennis, 1st officer on the
Mukilteo-Clinton ferry
called at

11:30 am
with a report of
4-5 orcas
, spread out and milling just south of the ferry lane.

I saw two
orcas
just off
Edmonds
heading north (NE?) towards the Edmonds ferry terminal. They were just off the marina. One was possibly a male as it had a very large fin on it's back. The time was about

10:30 am.
