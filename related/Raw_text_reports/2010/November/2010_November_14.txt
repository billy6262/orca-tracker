Orca Sightings for November 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were disappointed no orcas showed up to celebrate the inaugural run of the new Chetzemoka ferry (Pt Townsend/Keystone-Coupeville run) yesterday, but on the return trip at about

2:30 pm
, we did get to see
2 - 4 porpoise
- possibly Dall's, but they were too far to confirm species, mid-channel in Admiralty Inlet, a bit closer to the Whidbey side, heading SE.
