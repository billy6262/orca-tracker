Orca Sightings for March 24, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Howard Learned of Irondale, WA called to report
1 Gray whale
spotted in
Pt. Townsend Bay
at

5:30 pm
. It was south of
Chimacum Creek
, heading north, between Irondale and Indian Island.
*
A dark
dolphin-like cetacean
, larger than a harbor porpoise with a larger dorsal fin farther forward on its back but not as large as that of an orca, sighted at around

3:30 -
4:30
p.m. at 48.097N,-122.5114W in
Saratoga passage
. It was apparently feeding - I couldn't tell if it was struggling with a seal or going after the same prey. I watched through binoculars and saw no blood. Other seals watched calmly while this was going on for over half an hour, so I'm assuming the seal wasn't hurt. The cetacean jumped clear of the water periodically but mostly stayed under water in a small area with one large seal and causing the water to roil at the surface.

Warren Hartmann, volunteer for Whale Watch Spoken Here at the Lewis & Clark Interp. Center near
Ilwaco, WA
, called Orca Network to relay a report of
probable orcas
off the North Jetty at
1pm
. No direction of travel or definite numbers, but it could be the whales reported several days ago? Warren also reported they had counted 109 Gray whales passing by during their 3 hour count!
*
2 young orcas
just south of Carkeek (N. Seattle) from
645-745pm
. It was a treat to see them.

Jeff Morgan called Orca Network to report
2 orcas
off
Carkeek Park
, N. Seattle at

7:36 pm
. They were SW of the parking lot, looked very small, didn't see any real tall dorsal fins. They were staying in one area, in the small inlet to the south of the Park.
*
Nathan called Orca Network at

7:30 pm
to report seeing
2 whales
just south of
Carkeek Park
, N. Seattle. He saw 2 spouts, no tall dorsal fins, but said people who had been there earlier saw dorsal fins and saddle patches on the whales.
*
Orca
, at least 2, possibly 3 sighted directly off
Carkeek (N. Seattle)
, just west of the low-tide breakwaters, traveling north, from
420 - 445PM
. It seemed like they were feeding. Saw large fin on back of one, several side displays.

Eric and I went out this afternoon to photograph whale pits (this is part of an Orca Network & Cascadia Research program to chart whale feeding areas throughout the year). The tide was not very low, but there are quite a few. While we were at it we flew over to Hat Island and found three whales off of the SE tip of the island. One of the whales was easy to ID as "Patch" (#49). They were doing deep dives and headed towards Mukilteo.
Update: Here are some of the pictures I took of the
3 gray whales
about

5:30 Pm
last night off of the SE point of
Hat Island
. I got a pretty good sequence of Patch (#49) and I believe #53. Patch seems to have a few more scars on his/her left side, pics 20 and 32 really show it. I was not able to get a clear shot of the third whale.

At
5pm
had
two small Gray whales
feeding at low tide near the shoreline of
Oak Bay, Port Hadlock, Wa
. This is about 9 miles south of Port Townsend. The tip of S Whidbey Island is almost due east from our house. The whales worked their way north until they entered the cut that goes from Oak Bay into Port Townsend Bay. Indian Island is on the east side of the bay and Oak Bay is on the south side of Indian Island.

Just wanted to report
two gray whales
we spotted off the southern tip of Camano Island at

1:30 PM
. We followed them north to South Elger bay then had to leave around

3:45
. They appeared to be feeding in some spots. They were feeding a lot on the flat as you go into Elger where we left them.

We were on the ferry M/V Cathlamet going to
Clinton
(S. Whidbey Island) when we observed
a gray whale
surface, blow, and then dive showing its flukes. It was off the starboard side of the ferry 300-400 yards off Clinton Beach just prior to docking at the terminal. It was about

1:10 PM
.

At around
7AM
, over 3 hours before high tide, gotta call from a
Mariners
Cove neighbor, that
a whale
was out front. On a totally calm morning, gray, started its swirling/feeding activity. Very close in, 100' out from shoreline. Again, slowly, moving southwest towards
Polnell Pt.
Watched, for 20 minutes. Hard to say if this was the one yesterday, who is staking its territorial claim here or a new kid on the block.

This morning around

7:30
we spotted another
gray whale
, or the same, whale stopping for just a few minutes to feed before heading south. He was a bit closer to shore this time.

Oak Harbor
, Whidbey Island
