Transient orca pod
was still off
West Seattle
at
5 pm
.

Observations, IDs & comments on KOMO's video of the
Transients
off
W. Seattle
: "It looks like the
T30's and T172. T30A
is the bull who bops what looks like
T30C
. Pounding upon a younger sibling -- that's what older brothers are for! T172 has one nice solo surfacing too".
Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island

Jennifer Barwick of W. Seattle called Orca Network at

3:11 pm
to report
orcas
near
N. Vashon Island
heading slowly south.
*
Jim Hodgson, pilot for WDWF, reported seeing
a pod of orcas
off
Vashon Island
at the ferry lanes from the air at

2:30 pm
.

My son, Ian, is currently on the ferry from Fauntleroy to Southworth right now (

10:40 a.m.
) and is watching
at least 3 orcas
. He says they seem to be just kind of hanging out again
between Vashon & Lincoln Park
. They're rather surface active. He saw quite a bit of tail slapping. He estimated them to be about 200 yards from the boat.
Update at

1:40 pm
: The orcas are still near
Vashon Island
, in the ferry lane!

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called at

11:40 am
to report the
orcas
(presumably Transient pod in the area the last few days) were north of
Vashon Island
, near the ferry route, milling with no direction of travel. She called back at

12:40 pm
to report they were still there, in the same spot, still milling.
*
Want to make sure you guys know that
orcas
have been spotted off the Fauntleroy/Vashon ferry again, within past half hour.
Tracy @ West Seattle Blog

WA State Ferry ops called Orca Network to report a
half dozen orcas
sighted by the
Tillicum Ferry
crew at

10:27 am
, 3/4 mile NE of the
Vashon Island
ferry dock.

IDs for
Transient orcas
in photos & report from Kate Cummings of orcas in
Monterey Bay CA
: These look like the
CA51
matriline, often sighted in Monterey Bay and sometimes in southern California.

We spotted two whales that I think they were Minkes. There were at least two of them that spouted at the same time. We were watching from the deck of our home at Warm Beach. They seemed to be 1/2 between Camano and Warm Beach in front of the Camano Country Club area in
Port Susan
. We would see the small dark fin and the long dark body. They were stirring up the birds that hung around. They spouted single shots. We were not close enough to hear the spouting. They seemed to be slowly traveling north, but they stayed quite awhile, one hour at least, in that spot. We started watching them about from about
6:00 and watched
until 7 pm
when it got too dark.

Though it's difficult to determine, my guess is these were
likely gray whales
from the behavior described. Though they don't have dorsal fins, often the pectoral fin or tip of the fluke is seen when they are feeding. The spouts of Minke whales are seldom visible, and they tend to move around rather than stay and feed in one spot for a long period of time. sb

2:50 pm:
We've been watching a single
gray whale
about 100 yards offshore in front of our house in Olalla, just south of Anderson Point in
Colvos Passage
. He/she has been taking leisurely looking feeding dives for about 1/2 hour or so, staying in the same area. I'm so glad she/he found a whale 'snack bar' here so we could enjoy the visit- so exciting!
Sandy, Olalla

First trip of the year on Glacier Spirit!
1210 Two gray whales
just off SW corner of
Camano
, generally milling.
1250
Left
two grays
just N of
Gedney/Hat Isl
. One northbound, the other milling.
Erick Peirson, Port Townsend

8:27 am:
This morning two (I believe)
Grey whales
passed going north toward Utsulady Wa. from Madrona Beach area of
Camano Island
.
Jack, Camaon Island
*
I heard what sounded like
one or two Gray whales
spouting just south of Hidden Beach,
Greenbank
, between

2:30 and 3 am
. I couldn't determine direction of travel, they may have been moving back and forth feeding.
Susan Berta, Whidbey Island
