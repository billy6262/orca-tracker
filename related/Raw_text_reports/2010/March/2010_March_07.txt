Orca Sightings for March 7, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
My daughter was visiting with us and recorded, with her I-Pod, a couple of videos of
a Gray whale
. She did take a still with her I-Pod (pectoral fin) -I have attached it. We live on high bluff just west of Sandy Point, about a mile east of
Langley
. Great fun watching these gentle creatures feed.

Our group of 4 kayakers saw
one gray whale
1 mile due east of the south end of
Camano Island
at

11:30 AM to Noon
. We saw the whale surface to breathe many times, probably 30 to 40, often about twice per minute but with several longer intervals without surfacing. Charted water depth at the site is slightly over 100 meters. We circled around the whale at a distance of about 200 meters, so we could not see any marks or what it did while submerged. The whale did not appear to be moving significantly during that time, so we thought it was just resting near the surface.

orcas
off
Barkley Sound
by Peter Mieras of Rendevous Diving. Graeme Ellis of Canada's Dept. of Fisheries & Oceans identified them as
G pod, Northern Resident Orcas
