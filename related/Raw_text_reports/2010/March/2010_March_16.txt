============================================================

Entry 1:
Jill Hein and Sandra Pollard were doing marine mammal observations for Orca Network at Ft. Casey State Park this morning (
central/W Whidbey Isl
), & called at

10:55 am
to report a pod of
5 orcas
heading N fast, by 11 they were at
Pt. Wilson
- sounds like it could be the Transients that have been in Puget Sound!
