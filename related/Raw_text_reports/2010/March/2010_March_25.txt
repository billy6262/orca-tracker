Orca Sightings for March 25, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Malleson and Ken Balcomb were taking the newly reconditioned research vessel "Shachi" out on its first day of break-in sea trials off
Victoria
when Mark spotted
killer whales
heading east a few miles west of the Victor Hotel buoy off the waterfront. At
1003
, we had just approached the whales when the RCMP approached us and conducted a rather extended interview to be sure that we were operating under permit (enforcement will be vigorous this year, they said). We relocated the whales at 1023 and identified them as
T49A, 49A1, 49A2, 49B and 49B1
, who had by then found an adult male Steller sea lion. The whales finished the sea lion by 1132 and we left around
noon
so that Mark could get out in another boat and I could continue the sea trials.
