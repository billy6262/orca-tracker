We were out paddling from Langley and spotted a
Gray
heading south down the middle of
Saratoga Passage
around

9:30
. She didn't seem to be in any hurry to get anywhere. She got to the area about ¾ mile due south of Camano Head, stopped and just seemed to be "relaxing" there on the surface. We stayed a good 100 yards off and observed her for about 15 minutes, surfacing occasionally for a breath. A boat kept its distance (barely) with his engine idling and maneuvering for the "best view", and it wasn't 2 minutes after the boat arrived that the Gray started to move, fluke came up and down he went. The Gray surfaced about 200 yards off to the east of the Jet Boat, apparent to us that the Gray was now moving far faster than we had observed prior to this. The boat turned and started the pursuit, headed away from us. We could see the blows in front of the boat, with the Gray headed towards the Everett direction. This went on for a couple of hundred yards when we noticed the boat had slowed. After a bit, we saw the Gray surface between us and the boat - he had doubled back! It was pretty apparent to us at that point that the boat had "lost" the Gray as the boat kept idling in the same direction for several minutes before slowly changing his course. The Gray came directly at us, so we decided instead of hanging around to be graced with its presence, we would go on our way to Hat Island and not "tip off" the jet boat again. It worked. The boat slowly idled towards Sandy point, we headed towards Hat Island, and the Gray we could see appeared to have gone back to the same spot, resuming her relaxation!
