============================================================

Entry 1:
feeding pits
appear. There are hundreds from
Mabana to Elger Bay on Camano

Went to Possession Point Park (So. Whidbey Island) this

Orca Network received a call from Finn Gatewood, on the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
, reporting 3 spouts (likely
Gray whales
) at

11:13 am
, heading south, closer to the Whidbey Island side at about Glendale.
*
This morning at

7:00 AM a gray
whale came by form the northwest feeding in the shallow water. It circled back twice and was here until 8 AM before continuing to feed in front of downtown
Langley
(SE Whidbey Island, WA).

Thanks to a "wakie wakie, there's a whale" call from our neighbor Veronica, we watched
a gray whale
feed at the bottom of our yard, located along the NW end of
Langley
. The whale stayed 'round for about 30 minutes, feeding leisurely, then drifted off toward downtown Langley, traveling from west to east. I only saw one, but Veronica may have seen more. I did capture a bit of the activity on video and posted that to my SHAREN HEATH Facebook page, for those who enjoy FB.

A Minke whale
(off
Ebey's Bluff, central/NW Whidbey Isl
) heading north toward Pt. Partridge
~
9:30 am
.
Al Luneman, Coupeville, Whidbey Island WA

Entry 2:
"Probably"
a gray whale
, definitely not an Orca, not a Minke. Time: about

3:25PM
. Place: north side of Strawberry Island, east of
Deception Pass (NE Whidbey Island)
. Appeared to be just a single whale. It remained in the area for some time. I watched it for at least 15 min, then had to leave for another commitment. I watched it using binoculars from the south shore of Fidalgo Island. It surfaced and spouted several times in a few minutes, then remained submerged for a longer interval. It Resurfaced and repeated the behavior regularly. It appeared to be feeding in the area rather than passing through. One spy hop observed. Good sightings of the tail a couple of times as it submerged. the area forward of the tail had a conspicuous pattern of vertebra. Difficult to estimate size from where I was. I did get some photos but most just show the spouting, nothing that will likely help in identification.

Andrew Reding sent us some great photos of
several Gray whales
he observed in
Possession Sound
on Saturday. Whale #22 was photographed just yards off the southernmost tip of Whidbey Island at

1:24 pm
Daylight Savings Time, at 47 54 N, 122 23 W. It was in the company of a second gray whale (identified as #21). Another gray whale was photographed just off the southern tip of Gedney Island, 48 N, 122 18 W at

12:07pm
Daylight Savings time, headed into Possession Sound, where upon hitting the sandbar the whale turned northward. Here are more photos of that whale, in case you are able to ID it (ID'd as #531).

Thanks to Andrew's photos we were able to ID and confirm with Cascadia Research the identities of these 3 local whales!

We were out off south Whidbey and had
two large adult gray whales
linger around our boat for 90 minutes, the entire time staying very close. Forgot the camera at home. The larger of the two was the biggest gray we have seen in Puget Sound. And they had some very serious odor!

I sighted
a gray whale
in
penn cove
today. Whale spent several hours there, still there when I left.

I couldn't be in Baja--but I did see
the whale
in
Edmonds, WA
this AM -- nice way to welcome spring to Puget Sound!

Orca Network received a call from WA State Ferries
Edmonds dock
, reporting
a Gray whale
north of the ferry dock in very shallow water for several hours. It had also been there several days prior.

Laura Houston reported
a Gray whale
off
Des Moines, WA
.

Thanks to photos from several of you this past week, we have been able to identify three of the "regular" N. Puget Sound resident Gray whales, confirmed by John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research (see their Gray whale ID catalog - click on the very top link). Through photos of the whales' flukes (see above) and dorsal ridges, Whales #21 and #22 were identified, and #531 was identified also by the pattern of pigmentation on the pectoral fin, which was matched by a photo Veronica von Allworden had of #531's pec fin. Thanks to assistance from Veronica and other volunteers, we are hoping to obtain ID photos of all our local Gray whales' pectoral fins to assist with IDs in the future. Since much of their behavior in these waters is feeding behavior, often the pecs are all that are observed or photographed, so cataloging Pec ID photos could be helpful in IDing our local whales.

We saw
2 Gray whales
as we were taking the boat up from
Coupeville to Deception Pass.
The whales were first spotted at

1:30 pm
south of Hope Island feeding just off the channel. They slowly moved around to the north side of Hope Island and were diving into deeper water. I've not heard of Gray whales up this far north as the channel is very narrow with mud flats to the east.

Orca Network received a call from Kendall Berry of
Edmonds
at
2 pm
- they were seeing distant blows with binoculars that looked like the
orcas
reported earlier off Possession Pt. The orcas are now west of
Possession Pt.
(off Scatchet Head) & appeared to be heading W/NW up Admiralty Inlet.
*
Orca Network received a call at
1 pm
from Laura Nance, Possession Pt. Waterfront Park mgr, reporting
3 orcas
heading south off
Possession Waterfront Park
(in Possession Sound) heading south toward Possession Pt. Likely more Transients!
*
Steppe Williford of Oak Harbor called to report
a Gray whale
in
Penn Cove, Coupeville, Whidbey Island
at

2:30 pm
, less than 1/2 mile off the Coupeville Wharf. At first it was headed into the cove, when it surfaced again it had turned and was heading out of the cove.
*
While working on the computer in our office/sunroom, I looked up to see my first
Gray whale
spout of the year from the Orca Network office! It was off
Elger Bay, Camano Island
at

11:23 am
. I never did see the whale spout again (we only have a partial water view), so am not sure of direction, but it was great knowing there was a Gray in the neighborhood!

3 grays
off of
Sandy Point on SE Whidbey
at
10am
this morning.

About
10 AM
I glanced out our west window to see
a gray
blow out quite deep from the
Mabana Rd. (SW Camano Island)
, then a second. They were working their way across Saratoga Passage to south of Bells Beach. It's been over a week since I've seen them, and when I was down on our beach at a 0.0 tide yesterday, there was no indication they had been in feeding recently.
Barbara Brock, Camano Island

At

9:10am
we saw
one gray whale
swim by, heading north about 50 yards off
Tulalip Shores
. The whale then veered further out into Port Susan and as it headed North, appeared to be traveling rather than stopping to feed.
Vicki Mattson, Tulalip Shores

Veronica von Allworden of Langley called at

9:10 am
to report
3 Gray whales
right in front of
Langley
, SE Whidbey Island, heading SE.

My wife Barbara and I were on our way to the Garden Symposium in
Coupeville
this morning and ended up nearly late. About

8:45 AM
, saw
a Grey Whale
at the end of
Penn Cove
heading West then East feeding. Barbara saw whale breath over top of the water and said, "what a funny patch of fog", then we realized what it was ! We pulled in to the parking area that the mussel and clammers usually use on the West side of the cove and there he or she was again spouting and rolling. We drove around to Madrona Way to get better light to see him pop up several more times at least once showing nearly his entire upper body. Made for the start of a wonderful day. Still have not seen the Whales from our work place at the Naval Station! Can't wait; it's not spring until we see the Grey Whales off Rocky Point.
