Orca Sightings for March 8, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After a couple more sighting reports this
morning
in
Dana Passage (Puget Sound)
, Cascadia responded by land and found
a single gray whale
in
Budd Inlet
, milling around mid-channel. It appeared to be a little skinny, but was active. It surfaced several times, arching nice and high, allowing for ID photos. As of
1400
, the whale was still there. We don t know who this is, although we do know that it's not any of the North Sound regulars. We ll be comparing it to the rest of our catalog over the next couple of days.

Discovery Island, BC
.

A report this
afternoon
from Cascadia Research of another
gray whale
in
Budd Inlet
. It's not one of the North Sound regulars, so we may be having more visitors again this year.
