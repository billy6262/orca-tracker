I went kayaking today. I put in at the Mukilteo Light House and paddled over towards Whidbey Island, in hopes of spotting some of the gray whales that have been roaming around there. And, around

3:05pm
I encountered one! This
gray
appeared to be feeding in the shallows off
Whidbey Island
, about a mile north of the Clinton ferry terminal (exact coordinates: N47 59.934 W122 22.195). I watched as this gray blew repeatedly, then lifted its white pectoral fin into the air, holding it there for 15-30 seconds, before submerging completely. It repeated this blow followed by pectoral fin display another 3-4 times. I'm guessing it was feeding. After the last pectoral fin display, the gray whale submerged then began swimming in my direction. I backed up to give it more distance, and, as I backed up, the gray changed direction and began heading almost directly east towards Gedney/Hat Island. I gave it a several minute head-start and then began pursuing it, watching for its blows, being careful to maintain a respectful distance. I followed it for another 50 minutes, watching it blow, sometimes arching its back, exposing its tail fluke, then diving for an extended period. I was luckily enough to continue spotting its blow, and I was able to follow it all the way to a point just north of Gedney/Hat Island. I last saw it at
4:05pm (exact coordinates: N48 01.806 W122 19.942), when I had to turn around and head back to Mukilteo Light House. A google map of my GPS path can be found here, with two markers for the first and last sightings of the gray whale. I also filmed this entire encounter with a wearable HD video camera. I was able to capture the initial sighting and all the subsequent sightings. The video of the initial sighting is pretty good overall. Unfortunately my respectful distance and the lack of zoom on this waterproof HD camera make for a lack of significant details for identifying this gray whale. It's cool to watch, if for no other reason than to watch the pectoral fin display as it fed. I'll work on paring down the video sizes and post them for you and others to see via the Orca Network Facebook page. I'll also see if I can get some video editing / effects software that will allow me to zoom in on some of the sights I detailed above, take stills from the video, etc.

I happened to be in the First Beach area of Country Club (
E. Camano
) this AM about

8:30 AM
. There were
2 grays
quite a ways out in Port Susan, too far away to see much more than spouts, backs, and occasional tail fluke.

Shortly, after
9PM
tonight;
a single gray
I presume passed through Mariners Cove area (NE Whidbey Isl). Hearing, a spout every few minutes, heading northeast towards Strawberry Pt. Easy to hear as waters were glassy calm on quiet evening.

Howard Learned of Irondale, WA called to report
1 Gray whale
spotted in
Pt. Townsend Bay
at

5:30 pm
. It was south of Chimacum Creek, heading north, between Irondale and Indian Island.
*
It has been a while since I was able to get out on the water but today was that special day when despite sizable waves, gusty winds and plenty of wet spray, we had whales! It made our Zodiac trip all the more exciting to see the killer machines, the
Transients
, the
T49's
and the big bull
T103
milling around. They were identified by Mark Malleson who was Skipper on the Zodiac. The whales were onto something, beneath the surface when we arrived at
2pm
. We never saw the kill but could smell the oily slick off in the distance and could see the clean-up crew, the Mew Gulls, fly in to take the crumbs off the surface of the waves. No doubt a hapless, Harbour Seal. We first saw them off
Albert Head
, Vancouver Island, after a tip from shore. We left them heading toward the Victoria Harbour and south east.

Back again! This time much closer. What we believe to be
a large gray whale
(easily 50') close in to shore, 75 yards or so. Apparently feeding, cruising back and forth south to north, in a quarter mile circle, just south of boat launch at
Redondo (N. of Tacoma, WA)
. Closer in to shore than the floating break water, sometimes within 50 yards of shore. Have been watching since
7 pm
until too dark to see well but still hear him blow!!

Orca Network received a call from Thayer Cueter of
Edmonds, WA
, reporting
2 Gray whales
off Brackett's Landing, N. of the ferry. 1 was further out, the smaller whale was 25' from shore and had been in the same spot from

3:30 pm until 5 pm
, but moving its tail. 3/4 of its body was out of the water during the lower tide, but as the tide was coming in it seemed to be shifting around a bit.
*
Vicki Morrison called Orca Network to report
1 Gray whale
off
Edmonds
at Brackett's landing near the underwater park, N. of the Ferry dock from

3:30 - 4 pm
.
*
Note: We believe some of the reports from previous days of Orcas off Carkeek Park may indeed have been this Gray whale - though earlier reports of a Gray and orcas may have been both species.
*
Brian McLoughlin of the WA Dept. of Fish & Wildlife called Orca Network to report
1 Gray whale
in the cut between
Oak Bay
and Port Townsend Bay at
1454
, heading toward Port Townsend, WA.
*
Fred Lundahl of
Langley
called in two reports of
Gray whales south
of Langley today:

10:30 am:
3 Grays
off Witter Beach, S. of
Langley
- 1 large whale and 2 smaller whales, feeding.

1:45 pm:
2 of the whales had headed S. toward Clinton, but the large whale turned around and was back feeding at Witter Beach at
1:45 pm.

Nancy Zaretzke of Greenbank called to report
2 Gray whales
heading N off
Hidden Beach
in Saratoga Passage

10:35 - 11 am
.

This morning at

8:45
,
3 gray whales
came by
NW Langley
, Whidbey Island, WA traveling from NW to SE, feeding in the shallow water. I've included pictures. I think two of them are #22 and #531, I'm not sure about the third one and I'll try to ID it by its fluk

Whew - ran to
Carkeek Park
on my
lunch
and, lo & behold, I actually found the whale! In my humble, lay opinion I believe it is
a gray whale
. It is still in the little cove immediately to the south of the park. I did not see any dorsal, just a smooth back. It does seem on the small side, though.
