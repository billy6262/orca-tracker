Orca Sightings for March 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were lucky enough to see a small pod of
4-5 orcas
headed south a mile or so south of
Double Bluff, Whidbey Isl.
around

9:30 am
. We assumed they were transients because of the small size of the pod. They would surface as a group a couple of times and then not resurface for quite some time (8 - 10 minutes).

Looks like
5 Transients
passing Smallpox bay (NW
San Juan Island
) right now! (

7:45PM
). May be the same group that was down in Puget Sound yesterday. Heading north at about 2 knots.

Approx

6:45 pm
we had a small group of
orcas
pass by
Hannah Heights
(NW
San Juan Island
) headed north rather close to shore. Two males with accompanying females/calves?

At approximately
1pm-
2:30pm
1 mile
South of Clinton Ferry dock
on Whidbey Island. (
Orca
) whales seemed to be feeding. It is known to me as a fishing hole in front of my house where I was during my lunch time when they caught my eye and stayed for an hour and half. Took videos both from bluff and beach. The video shows a minimum around eight blows in a matter of seconds. One whale had a distinct white marking that came up and behind dorsal fin. In the 8-12 whales I saw there were two younger ones, one small and one a bit bigger, trailing four whales that seemed to move together. Hope that helps your research. Maybe you can tell me which Pod I saw.

At
dusk
, we were just leaving the
Kelp Reef marker
, (Haro Strait) "What's that?" "
Orcas
!" I said.

Around

11:30 pm
, just as I was about to fall asleep; I heard a sound. As, in, was that a spout? Got up and went out into the patio and sure enough there was a gray. In the dead calm of night, the swirling/swishing, during the late snack was almost a roar/rushing sound of a river. Then, after a couple of minutes, a mighty blow. Gray, slowly moved south towards Polnell Point after the 15 minute visit. Now, hoping for a day sighting, but, I'll take last night for a starter.

Grey whale
off

Terri Dix of Edmonds called Orca Network to report a
Gray whale
off Edmonds, N of the ferry dock at
2 pm
, rolling on its side with pectoral fins out of the water (feeding behavior). She watched it for 45 minutes.

Thanks to Laura Spehar for forwarding this report on: This morning, on a news tip, I diverted from my trip to the office and spent 15 minutes filming a mother and her calf (
Gray whale
) apparently feeding in the sediment 50-100 ft off Marina Beach (S. edge of the Marina),
Edmonds, WA
. There were about a dozen people on the beach in awe of the spectacle. What jumped out at me was the idea that the mother and her calf found a feeding spot right at the Edmonds Marsh outlet. In fact, I wondered if they used the discharge pipe as a scratching object. The thought struck me that if we could open up, daylight, increase the tidal flow, the open marsh could be an enhanced source of organic material that would further enhance the benthic food for these whales. They presumably eat amphipods living in the sediments. That is, a real salt marsh might help the whales. Regardless, I am reminded that the Marsh is a resource that connects the watershed to the Sound. And possibly to the whales from Baja.

I am in
Juneau, Alaska
and went for a boat ride south through Gastineau Channel. A few miles south of town I encountered
6 orcas
-- 5 adults and one very young one. They were traveling north in the channel heading toward town. I had some boat problems and the wind was blowing, so I didn't get a chance to take many pics. Always good to see them up here too.

On my drive home from Freeland this

Holmes Harbor
, just south of Baby Island.
