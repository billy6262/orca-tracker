Orca Sightings for March 12, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
At

4:30pm
we spotted a
Gray
very close in shore in front of
Tulalip Shores
, heading South. He was showing his fin and tail as he was feeding, very slowly moving South. My two young charges (ten year old boys) and I walked south along the beach and around the point, looking now towards Tulalip Bay. We were easily keeping pace with the Gray and delighted to see how much of his body was being exposed while feeding. Then from the direction of Tulalip Bay, we saw another blow. We watched as the second gray headed right for the whale we had been watching. They met up and fed right next to each other for about 5 minutes. Then the gray that was headed south continued on south and the gray that was heading north continued north. They passed by each other around

5:30 pm
. About an hour later we looked across Port Susan and saw two blows together, the grays heading towards the head of Camano. It was a delightful dance to watch! Unfortunately no camera!

Is it possible that we saw one or two
Humpbacks at Lagoon point?
My wife saw a whale surface so I watched for several min but only saw a fluke at a distance far to the south of us. Usually when I have seen Gray it is a long body along the surface. This whale did not show a dorsal fin only a fluke like Humpbacks I have seen in Hawaii though it was half mile away.

It's difficult to know whether this was a Gray whale or Humpback, without a description of the back - Humpbacks would have a small dorsal fin, and Grays have no dorsal fin, just "knuckles" or bumps on the dorsal ridge. Both these species show their flukes when doing deep dives - sb

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales found the
orcas
off
Fauntleroy
at

3:10 pm
- he could see 4 - 5 of them in the ferry lanes, ~1/3 of the way across from the Seattle side. They were circling back & forth, hunting & tearing something up, with birds coming in for scraps. 1 male & 3 - 4 others.

4 orcas
swimming about.
