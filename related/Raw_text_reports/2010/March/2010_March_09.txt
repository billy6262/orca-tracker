Orca Sightings for March 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Great, clear
transient calls
(

8:31 pm
) on
OrcaSound hydrophone
! There weren't any earlier auto-detections at Lime Kiln, thus far all LK detections have been fainter than at OS, and the prevalence of LK detections is increasing, so perhaps the source is southbound in Haro Strait? To me it sounds like the same calls nearly simultaneously on both streams, so maybe we have a single animal making nice loud calls?
