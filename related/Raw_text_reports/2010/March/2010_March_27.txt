Orca Sightings for March 27, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I heard about a juvenile
gray
in
Liberty Bay
the weekend before Easter. Our friends at Liberty Bay Marina said it surfaced and blew not far from the outer float at the marina, heading slightly north up into the bay.

Followed
a gray whale
with my bike all day yesterday as it worked its way just offshore from
Lincoln park
to just past
Alki Beach
- what a great day for land-bound whale watchers in West Seattle. I only hope that this one will be okay.

Well our
gray whales
returned for a day visit. Two, mother and calf were sighted in the channel of
Penn Cove
just off Scenic Heights Road about 500 feet off shore. Feeding and playing westbound towards the mussel farm. What a sight, as this was my first sighting ever. About an hour later, they returned coming back through (no outlet) and I waited. I did take some pictures but used my SLR camera and will have to take them in to be developed. I am so thrilled they came during the day time. Mom is big but the calf is much smaller and they came up for air about every 10 minutes.

We have had a mature (approximately 30' to 40')
gray whale
within 25 yards of shore in front of our house for 30 minutes at a time. We live on the south shore of Oak Bay near
Admiralty Inlet, just north of Port Ludlow
, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula. Our GPS position is 47 degrees-58 minutes-17 seconds north and 122 degrees-41 minutes-9 seconds west. It appears to be either feeding or scraping itself in the shallow waters, but does not appear to be in distress.

We had a whale around

11:45 am
around the same area - off the South Beach of
Discovery Park
. Unfortunately, I was unable to get a good look at this whale and don't know what kind it was for sure. It was definitely 20 feet or larger and reports from visitors and park volunteers have varied on whether there was a dorsal fin or not. Most have reported it to have a dorsal fin, but mottled coloring. Sorry for the lack of ID!

Mallard or somebody from Victoria should be reporting
T49A's & 49B's
again near
Race Rocks
today. Lots of Steller sea lions around, so eats is good.

Warren Hartmann, volunteer for Whale Watch Spoken Here at the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center, called to reporting another sighting of
4 - 6 orcas

We watched the
grey whale
off
Carkeek Park
(N. Seattle) tonight from

5:00-
5:30
. It was ~1/4 mile south of the main beach in the large cove and was surfacing and spouting about every 3-5 minutes.

~
3:40 pm
). Feeding and playing. They're heading north around the point towards Tulare.

Lori Willson called to report
one Gray whale
off W. Seattle at
1:30 pm, swimming N. She then sent this report: Wow! What a joyous day here on the shores of West Seattle. I just got back after spending about 3 hours watching the gray. I first saw it just south of Emma Schmitz Memorial Viewpoint. It slowly made its way north, stopping and staying in one area from time to time, before moving on again. It generally stayed fairly close to shore, sometimes as close as 150 yards or so. It seemed to pick up the pace, though, once it got to Alki Point. I lost sight of it after that and kind of lost it in the crowd along the main drag of Alki. Some kayakers and possibly some divers got some amazing views. Lots of boats out on the water today but most seemed to be keeping a respectful distance. Around
4:00, when the whale started to move north faster, there did seem to be an increase in the number of boats closer to it and headed the same direction. I was unable to tell if they were chasing the whale or just going the same direction. It was just a fantastic afternoon and it was so fun to hear the excitement in the oohs & aahs of the kids and adults around me. What a treat! I never thought I'd see this right off the shores of West Seattle. You can see my pictures of the whale posted on Picasa here.

We observed a
lone gray whale
approximately 100m off the west shore of Me-Kwa-Mooks park, West Seattle. We began watching from the park at 1330 and continued for about 30 min. In that time the whale transited slowly north, moving less than a quarter mile. We saw distinct feeding behavior, seeing the animals fluke and pectoral fins as it was on its side in the shallow water. Hope some of you also enjoyed the sighting,
Heidi and Kwasi.

many people, including me :~) at the lighthouse in discovery park were watching a whale close to shore within 200 yards right at the tip of the lighthouse point. it swam from there towards
ballard locks
and then towards the north. others seemed to think it was
a grey whale
. it was by itself. it was about
1pm
today. what a sight to see on such a calm water day!!! i hope it is healthy and able to make it's way to where it should be going - it is not 'normal' for grey whales to be in puget sound, is it?

We do get Gray whales in Puget Sound each year - one group of 10 - 12 whales arrives each spring to feed in the waters of N. Puget Sound, around Whidbey & Camano Islands and in Possession Sound. But each year we typically get a few "stragglers" from the migration north that aren't strong or healthy enough to make the full migration, and often arrive in Puget Sound skinny. These whales may not know where the good feeding beaches are, and there are usually several Grays that unfortunately don't survive and wash up somewhere on a Puget Sound beach. sb

Erick Peirson called at
11 am
to report
1 Gray whale
off
Fauntleroy, W. Seattle
, heading N. He called again to relay reports of
1 Gray whale
N. of Hat/Gedney Island, and another off Sandy Pt, south of Langley, Whidbey Island at noon.

A small
gray whale
spent much of this morning foraging just offshore on the north side of Colman Pool, Lincoln Park,
West Seattle
- much to the delight of a gathered crowd of adults, children, and dogs. Around
11:00 am, it headed north to Lowman Beach (about 1/2 mile north). Amazingly, when I opened the photos on my computer, I saw that the angle of the sunlight gave some of the blows a rainbow effect I hadn't seen with my naked eye!

At
730
this morning, I saw what looked like an unusual disturbance in the water, just south of Brace Point (W. Seattle), very close to shore. It was in about 15-20 feet of water, but close to the drop off to much deeper water. It appeared to be a large whale, black or dark gray, with no dorsal fin. It looked larger and also longer than the Orcas we've seen around here. At first, it was moving quickly and sporadically, just breaking the surface of the water and not showing much of itself. Then it started moving slowly in a circle for a few minutes, disturbing the water, mostly submerged. It then partially surfaced and spouted twice, a few minutes apart, then swam off toward the deeper water, showing a lot of it body before disappearing. Approx coordinates: N 47 30'59.04, W 122 23'47.04 Thanks!

Definitely sounds like a Gray whale - sb

I awoke at
7AM
this morning to
a gray
feeding out front (
Mariner's Cove, NE Whidbey Isl
). About, 20 minutes later, gray, spouted its way NE towards Strawberry Pt. It certainly appears, gray has established, as, one of its feeding areas; waters, between Polnell & Strawberry Points.
