Orca Sightings for March 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have a beach house on
Elger Bay on Camano Island
. Unsure of exact amount, but it appeared to be
three Gray whales
seen on both Monday and Tuesday. They appeared to be slowly moving East. We are pretty sure they were feeding, as they were close to the beach and it looked like they were swimming on their side, with their (arm) flippers out of the water. We think they were digging up the sand in order to find food.

After hearing that there were
Orcas in Penn Cove
, we went to the wharf at Coupeville and spotted them moving east out of Penn Cove about

7:30pm
. The orcas were closer to the north side of the Cove. When we first spotted them, they were close to Monroe Landing.

7:30 PM
-
Two Ocras
came through
Penn Cove, Coupeville
. A large and a small. Two seals were avoiding them as they came close to the shore on the Scenic Heights side.

The
afternoon
'Goldwing' tour was planned to take Brett and I way to the Northeast of Victoria to Pt. Doughty (Northwest corner of Orcas Island). We had recent information that Ken Balcomb was on scene with a group of Transients which were making a kill on a Sea Lion. However, as we were transiting through Oak Bay, one of the Prince of Whale zodiacs picked up a small
Gray Whale
Westbound in
Enterprise Channel
. We spent about 20 minutes sitting with our engines off as the whale swam circles all around us, which was very curious behaviour to see in such a busy channel. After our short visit with the curious little Gray Whale, we got a call that
4 Transients
were picked up just a few miles South of our location. Upon arrival we found the
T-30's
!!! They were very spread out and headed West at about 5 knots. We followed these animals for about half an hour towards
Albert Hd.
before we broke off and headed out to Race Rocks.

Saw the
Killer Whales
about
3 PM
in the same spot for several minutes on the surface going back and forth, from Hill Street on
Camano Island
. 2 - 3 whales from what we could tell. Didn't see any Gray Whales.

The guy with the photos was actually the one who spotted the male
Transient orca
off
Pt. Wilson
yesterday morning (3/29) - he pointed it out to Bob. His photos are on Flickr. Some great shots taken in
Saratoga Passage off Canamo Head
of the male, and a couple of the eldest gray on her side.

Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research looked at these photos and identified the Transients as the T18s.

Jan Graham called to report
a small pod of orcas
in
Penn Cove, Coupeville
- they had gone into Penn Cove until they were ~400 yards from the Capt. Whidbey Inn, and at

7:10 pm
were heading toward the Coupeville Wharf and out of the Cove.
*
Jill Hein of Coupeville called to relay a report from John Howard, who saw
4 orcas
in
Penn Cove
, near Coupeville, Whidbey Island, WA this
evening
.
*
We woke up to the sight of
six or seven transients
(?) off of Parker Reef on the
north side of Orcas Island
feeding and drifting slowly with the tide. Looked like
maybe six or seven orca
including three juveniles, too far off for getting any ID's.
A follow up on the transients I saw this morning: We found them on our trip today pretty close to where they earlier. There appears to be a new born in the group but I kept my distance and really couldn't get a good ID on any of them. Ken Balcomb took some photos to ID when he gets back to the Center. We did notice they had made a Steller sea lion kill and were in the process of finishing it off.

Ann Casey and Carol Plunkett of Freeland called Orca Network to report a sighting of
several orcas
from the
Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
at

11:09 am
. The orcas were north of the ferry lanes, heading N, & included 1 adult male and a small one.

Sounds like
Transients
on Lime Kiln Hydrophone (posted ~7 am PST). hopefully my recordings will be OK.

Erick Peirson on the Olympus called Orca Network at

12:05 pm
to report a small
pod of orcas
off the south tip of
Camano Island
. It appeared as if they were headed north up the west side of Camano in Saratoga Passage. He called a few minutes later saying they also had
several Gray whales in the area
, very close to where the Orcas were. At

12:15 pm
, he called to report that the orcas (1 male, 2 females and a juvenile) had approached the Gray whales (2 adults & a smaller one). The adult male orca made contact with one of the adult Gray whales - he said the Grays got in a defensive position, & rolled over a bit, and the orcas circled and the water roiled for awhile, but after about a minute the encounter ended and the orcas continued heading NW up Saratoga Passage at a fast pace. Whew!! He left them at

1:30 pm
as they continued north, mid-channel in Saratoga Passage, between Greenbank on Whidbey & Elger Bay on Camano.
We tried to find them again a bit later but didn't see them, so not sure what direction they went from there. Chris Dunagan of the Kitsap Sun interviewed Erick for his blog, Watching our Water Ways - click here to read more about this interesting encounter!

3 grays
heading north in front of
Tulalip Shores in Marysville Wa
. 20 yards off shore, rolling and eating/playing -

5:00pm
.. They've been here for 10 minutes. We see them daily so this must be a favorite eating spot. I'll try to upload the video I took later. Such beautiful creatures!

We went to look for the
orcas
in
Saratoga Passage
, which we didn't see, but we did see
1 Gray whale
NW of
East Pt, Whidbey Island
, heading toward Baby Island & into the entrance of Holmes Harbor, at

3:25 pm
.

10:15 AM
; this morning. Heading, SW. Low tide was around noon. Same? gray, with appetite; was back feeding at

3:30 PM
this afternoon. Gradually, heading SW towards Polnell Pt. Again, close to shore, within 100 feet or so.
