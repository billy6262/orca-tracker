Orca Sightings for March 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We watched
two Gray whales
at the north end of the
Ebey's trail
- very close to shore.
Jim Somers, Coupeville

Two belated 2nd/3rd hand reports of
orcas
off
Edmonds/Kingston
. We somehow missed them from our boat but our neighbors pulled into their slip right after we did (some time between

12:30 and
3:30
) and reported seeing
four orcas
heading north, one tall fin, yesterday afternoon. Then today a volunteer at the Aquarium reported her friend saw orcas (unspecified number) in the same area, same time frame.
Darcie Larson, S/V Groovy, Woodinville

Transient orcas T007, T007A, T041 and T041A
were west bound off Otter Point (Sooke,
SW Vancouver Island
) in the
afternoon
.
Mark Malleson, Victoria, B.C.

The afternoon trip on "Goldwing" took us out to the West of Sooke Harbour! At
1430
hrs., I spotted
5 Transients
1.5 nm Southwest of Otter Point. The
T7's
and
T41's
were traveling West in a resting pattern and we followed them until they were just Southeast of Sheringham Lighthouse. On the way home, we stopped in at the Bedford Islands and Race Rocks and sighted over 30 Steller Sea Lions, half a dozen Bald Eagles, lots of Harbour Seals and one Elephant Seal.

At
7:10 pm, a large
grey whale
was taking his time going north in front of our home on very South
Camano
, on Gull Way. It appeared he/she was feeding, as the water flatly pooled above him. He stayed under at least 2 minutes, taking his time. He eventually slowly moved north towards Pebble Beach.
Peg Boley, Camano Island
*
A lone
gray whale
was reported north of the
Edmonds
Underwater Park/Sunset Beach Sunday
afternoon
. This or possibly another solitary gray whale passed me while I was kayaking off Point Edwards at
6 pm
that evening. The whale was moving south at a steady pace of maybe 6 to 8 knots. Lat - 47°48'18.67"N, Long - 122°23'51.78"W

Waiting for the

4:30
Kingston ferry - saw a spout, doubted it, then a few more (not very big, sort of fan-shaped) then a curve of back with just a slightly hooked bump on it. Then nothing for a few minutes, then a couple more spouts, another glimpse of a curve with the bump. Then no more. Another passenger who scubas said it was not very deep there, some ling cod in that area. Perhaps a (darkish) gray whale or a small humpback?
Janet Dawson
From the description we'd say it was a Gray whale or whales, and we had reports of two Grays in that area at that time from others in yesterday's report - sb
*
We spotted a
gray whale
on the west side of
Hat (Gedney) Island
at about
11am
, and then saw
another gray
on the east side, very close to shore at about
1pm
. And I'm pretty sure he gave us a beautiful spy hop - (I saw it at the end---).
Mac LaMay, Whidbey Island

5 Transients
between Otter Pt. and Sheringham Pt. (
West of Sooke BC.
) going West around
1500
.
T7, T7A, T7B and T41, T41A
. Thanks to Eagle Wing Tours, Mark Malleson, POW and Russ Nicks, Sooke Coast Ex.

We found some
killer whales
about 6 miles west of
Moss Landing CA
when we were heading in from our trip today. Thought we were only going to see gray whales - what a pleasant surprise! There were two different groups, one consisting of two whales and the other of three. While they were in the same vicinity, within the hour we were watching them they did not join together. When we found them at

1:30
they were heading east towards the harbor and when we left at
2:15, the group of three surfaced about a mile east of us with the pair following them at a distance. Pretty cool! I can see one of the whales has a nick at the base of its dorsal fin. Hopefully you can identify some of these guys! See ya!

We got back to our marina, Fair Harbor in Grapeview WA at

6:10 PM
, just in time to see the
grey whale
surface and blow in about 25 feet of water, just barely clearing the dock. He then dove back down and went under the dock and moored boats and headed back out into
Case Inlet
proper.
Pamela Benson, Grapeview, WA

Kendall Berry of Edmonds called Orca Network to report one or
two Gray whales
right off the Diving Park in Edmonds at

4:20 pm
. She called back at
5:05 pm to confirm it was two whales, and there was a good crowd enjoying them from the shore.
*
Two
gray whales
very close to shore at the far end of
Ebey's trail
on the west side around

4:30
.
Jim Somers, Whidbey Island

My son and husband were hiking today at
Ebey's Landing
(W. Central Whidbey Island) and spent 20 minutes, starting at around

3:30
, watching
two whales
(they look like
grays
from their photos) about 100 yards or less off the far end of the spit.

At

1:30 PM
, I was flying and spotted this
gray whale
feeding by the large marker between
Everett and Hat Island
. It might be Patch, #49, I did not get a good look at it's back. Note the bald eagle that was circling over head! Also, at
4:40 PM we were at Possession beach (S. Whidbey Isl) and saw
6 to 8 Dall's porpoises
traveling to the south closer to the Whidbey side than to the main land.
