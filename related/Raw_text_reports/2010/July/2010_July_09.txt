Orca Sightings for July 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
This afternoon aboard the Western Explorer around

1:00 PM
we met up with J-Pod and the few K-Pod whales that have been traveling with them. They were between
East Point and Point Roberts
, at first heading towards Boundary Pass and then turning and heading back north. I was able to positively ID
K21, K40, J32, J34, and J38
. I don't know what has gotten into these whales lately (hopefully lots and lots of Chinook salmon!) but on my encounters with them over the last week it seems like they have been especially active. Today was no exception as we saw breach after breach. It sure is good to see them spending so much time in the inland waters lately!

'Mystic Sea' sighted members of the
Southern Residents
(believed to be
L pod and possibly K21, Cappucino
) well spread out in the
Strait of Georgia off Point Roberts
around
1.00 pm
- the whales were highly and consistently active exhibiting numerous breaches, cartwheels and lobtailing with the occasional spyhop thrown in for good measure.

I was with the tour trip out of Port Townsend and we encountered
Orcas
on the bottom south-west side of
San Juan island
. We had a great time and I am confused though, they said they were "L" pod, but in your reports, you said "K" pod - so here are some pics, hope you can use some of them. (one photo submitted from S. SJI that morning had J1, and one of your photos does look like L88 - but since several K pod whales have been traveling with J pod, it's possible that members of all 3 pods were present - ON). Oh and I am sending a collage of the Orca with the
Minke
as well.

I was out with the [
orcas
] on Thursday and Friday; don't have much to add to the
July 8 reports you've already posted except to say that just after we stopped to watch the southern residents in Haro Strait, a
minke
surfaced near us--wonder if it was the same one who has been hanging around the orcas lately? It was heading south, away from the orcas, but cruised along the surface for quite some time before we lost sight of it.
July 9, we found the
J's
about 3 miles NE of
Patos Island.
At first they were fairly spread out, traveling toward Saturna Island in small subgroups, but after a while Granny did some lobtailing and they all turned north and gathered in a tide rip. Suddenly it was breachfest! I lost count of how many breaches we saw; at one point I saw three orcas in the air at once! Lots of lobtailing and cartwheeling too. We also saw about a dozen or so
porpoises
just NW of Patos as we came out of Boundary Pass. During our return trip to Seattle we passed Minor Island and saw lots of new harbor seal pups as well!

I went out on Maya's Westside Charters at

10:00a.m.
We went north to meet with
J pod
and the
4 K pod
whales as they came south. We found the Granny J-2/Ruffles J-1 group of about 15 J pod whales (the same split configuration that they have been in for the last month) and surprisingly also Canuck L-7 and Lulu L-53 were traveling with them! As we were traveling back south toward home, other whales had been spotted heading toward East Pt., our direction of travel, so we stopped to see who was there. It was the rest of the J pod whales and the 4 K pod whales (K21, K40, K16 and K35). More of the story on my blog.

The
Gray whale
that had live-stranded for the 2nd day in a row near
Everett and Mukilteo
, swam away again when the high tide came in the afternoon.
