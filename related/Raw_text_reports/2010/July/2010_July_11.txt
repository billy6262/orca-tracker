Orca Sightings for July 11, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
My sister and I saw a whole pod of
Orcas
very close to the shore about
7am
, along Beach Drive (
Victoria
, B.C.).

Brent Norberg of NOAA Fisheries (who had earlier this week been in the water with the stranded gray whale) was out crabbing on Sunday, and who should swim past him but the
Gray whale
he helped rescue?! He was
between Tulalip Bay and S. Camano Island
, near Spee-Bi-Dah, and the whale seemed headed toward Port Susan, around
4 pm
.

On a lighthouse tour this afternoon we came across
L Pod
members cruising north along Stuart and on past Turn Point at
1700
. They seemed to be in high spirits with the major tidal rips and upwellings off Turn Pt. Among others, not identified, we espied
L- 12,22,25,41,72,78,79,93,105,113
. On our am trip,
J1
was surfing in the six foot swells as he came across Haro Strait arriving at the county park around about 1030. We also saw J2 and others inshore. It was so dramatic out there this morning with big swells, 20 knots SW wind, fog curtain rising and falling, sun silvered seas and surfing whales!

We were passing through
Speiden Channel
and fortunately for us, the whales decided to head in that same direction, and we found a nice group of whales just north of Battleship Island. Even from 1/2 mile away, we were able to pick out
J1 Ruffles
. Our passengers were amazed that I could ID a whale from that far away-well, until I told them how I did it. That dorsal fin is mighty distinctive. And soon we were close enough that they could see his wavy fin, along with Granny
J2's
nicked dorsal fin. Following behind J1 & J2 were about 6-8 more individuals, and we were privileged enough to see several breaches (see Photo of the Day, above), tail lobs, and a spyhop. Our
afternoon
trip had us in a quandry as we had two groups of whales within our reach. The whales made were right between
Kellett Bluff and Stuart Island
, in fairly calm waters. It was amazing. We had the
L32s
and
L12s
foraging in the currents. At one time we had 4 whales tail-lobbing at the same time. Lots of back and forth directional changes. And even better, the sun was shining and the waters were fairly calm. But best of all, it was like we were having our own private wildlife experience as we were the only boat with this group. I think in the hour we were on-scene, the whales moved less than 1/2 mile total. We saw
L85, L79, L41, L12, L25
all working the current lines. Several breaches, including one by L79 (I'm about 80% sure), spyhops, and tons of tail lobs. Too soon it was time to head back to reality, and we were all happy and content to have shared some time with these amazing creatures.

At about

1:10 pm
we began hearing AMAZING
calls
and whistles on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. VERY strange calls - one sounded like it was whistling a tune for awhile!!

At about

1:15 pm
: Nice
calls
- behind the boat sounds! Are those J pod calls?? They sound different! Northbound I think? On Orca Cam (Ctr. for Whale Research, NW San Juan Isl) I seen a couple breaches! (yay me!) and the boats appear to be moving north ?? And some ALMOST sounded transient like - maybe they are "happy whales" with full bellies - I'd like to think so!
2:20 pm: Orca Sound hydros now !!! They moved north! I was right! NICE and LOUD! Sound like they are quacking!!!

They did head north! We heard some squeaks at about
10 am
and bolted to
Lime Kiln
in the thick fog.. stayed awhile and eventually the bigger group including
L41 and J's
headed north. they were playing in the kelp beds and spending time on the surface - we went up to county park as well and they were again in the kelp beds. Nice tight groups.
