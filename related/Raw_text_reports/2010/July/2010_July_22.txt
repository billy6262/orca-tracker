Orca Sightings for July 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
The whales had been reported in 4-5 foot swells of the south end of
San Juan Island mid-morning
today. By the time we reached them on our
afternoon
trip they were already all the way to
North Pender Island
! North Pender is one of the Canadian Gulf Islands, making today an international trip! As we, and other whale watch boats, looked on the whales fished, spy-hopped, breached, and swam this way and that, right up next to North Pender.

Out of the silence: the blow of a
Grey Whale
! the same distance from shore as we were, about 50 meters close !! Not a leisurely swim anymore now, back to the shore as fast we could - this Grey Whale was considerably larger than the one we could observe here a few times in the course of 2 weeks, so this, I assume, was a female; also outline of body is rounder, smoother; and the movements while feeding was very different.
