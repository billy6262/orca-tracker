Orca Sightings for July 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a two part whale sighting in
Active Pass
. The first group, with
Mr. Ruffles (J1)
bringing up the rear, came through around

11:30
. They came very close to our shoreline, swimming sideways (see photo of the day, above) and snuffling in the kelp. The second group, more active with many tail slaps and breaches, came through around 1 pm.
