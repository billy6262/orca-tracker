Orca Sightings for July 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jan, my wife, and I were visiting
La Push, WA
over the weekend and got a good look at a small group of
5-6 killer whales
off Third Beach on Sunday. We watched the whales for about 30 min or so sometime between
4 and 6 pm.
The whales were loitering around much of the time at the edge of Strawberry Bay - we viewed them from Third Beach. They eventually made their way from the eastern part of the bay to the west end and were approaching Teahwhit Head (going northwest) when we last saw them. We were able to see them well enough to note the white eye patch and the silver saddle behind the dorsal fin at times, which confirmed our identification. Two were immatures while the other 3 or 4 were adults. All had curved dorsal fins and there were no adult males in the group. We didn't take any photos, but in hindsight, that might have helped confirm them as transients, I suppose. It was difficult to confirm group size because they never swam and surfaced in any organized manner, but there were definitely at least 5 and perhaps 6. I think that about covers it. I never thought I'd see killer whales along the outer coast so it was very exciting!

4:30 pm Posession Sound
area - Saw a
gray whale
just off shore between Harborview Park and Howarth Park, headed east toward
Everett
. Very close to shore, constantly rolling and blowing, worked its way toward Everett/Port Gardner. Showed up later in the day around 6 pm or so, also.

Jeff Hogan of Killer Whale Tales called to report
J pod
at
Lime Kiln
, heading north at

5:40 pm
, amongst the wind and whitecaps.
*
Orca Network received a call from Arlene Solomon on
Mayne Island
, reporting
~7 orca
s went by at

4:05 pm
heading north, passing Enterprise Reef and entering Active Pass on the west side.
*
We saw what appeared to be part of
Jpod
between Granny's Cove (
American Camp Nat'l Park
) and Eagle Point this afternoon around
3pm
. Lots of quick lunging and tracking along the surface--hopefully finding some good fish.

In the
morning
we met up with part of
J-Pod
two miles south of
Turn Point
slowly heading north at

11:30 AM
. We saw
J1
do half a dozen breaches,
J2
give to big cartwheels, and
J8
clear the water on a breach as well. The "whale fireworks" outdid the traditional fireworks of the evening on this day, as it is always especially awesome to see some of the older whales going strong. In the
afternoon
around
3 PM
we met up with a different group of
J-Pod
whales right off
Kellett Bluffs
. They were milling around, not going anywhere in particular, and spending a lot of time rolling at the surface. In the swell it was tough to confirm IDs, but
J34
was definitely there, as were
K21 and K40
who seem to have become honorary
J-Pod
whales of late. As always, you can see photos of our encounters on my blog.

We headed to the west side of
San Juan Island
today to oo and awe in the presence of our resident
J-pod orcas
. We spotted the orcas off every direction of the boat. Not to mention that two bald eagles were flying above us. The orcas were spread out from each other, occasionally joining with a family member to travel in a small closely knit group. We spotted at least one calf, with orange markings that will eventually turn white as the orca matures. The J-pod has had four new calves since 2009. Before we turned back to Friday Harbor the orcas gave us a grand finale. They breached and cartwheeled, creating big splashes and allowing us to view the white undersides of their bellies.

We headed north towards Battleship Island, and before we knew it, we were seeing a very familiar, large dorsal fin with a wavy back edge to it. Yep--our good friend
J1, Ruffles
. He was traveling like a good son near his mom,
J2 Granny
. The bulk of whales were behind them by several miles, so we decided to hang out with Ruffles and Granny for a bit. Ruffles decided he wasn't so old after all and launched out of the water!! And I guess he must have had some good food last night as we heard on the radio that he breached an additional 5 times that morning! We then watched
J27
and gang come by, and they were porpoising as they sped to catch up to J1 & J2. We had a report of another group of whales that were just milling around Kellett Bluff, so off we went. Along the way we made a very wide scan for dall's porpoises, but they have been very scarce this summer. As we floated about 400 yards from the small group of whales, we noticed that they were taking turns meandering into
Open Bay
, then out along the shore into the current, and back again. Whales were logging on the surface, some for 2-3 minutes at a time. One whale in Open Bay did a large cartwheel. Another spyhopped along the shoreline at Kellett. And then a big male came up and finally an ID--
K21 Cappucino
! So knowing he's tight with sister K40 Raggedy, we began looking for her tell-tale dorsal fin. But no sign of her, just a whale with about a foot of her nose sticking out of the water. Kinda like she was thinking of doing a spyhop, but just holding the nose out of the water. For nearly 2 minutes! And then she rose to take a breath and voila--K40! The whales had been milling at Kellett for nearly an hour before we got there, and after about 30 minutes, decided it was time to head south. K40 did 3 breaches, there were lots of surface percussives and more spyhops, and the whales decided "rest and recreation" time was over and it was time to move on.

Up to
10? Orcas
, including 2 babies, close to shore by
Turn Point Lighthouse
traveling north
mid day
. They were quite awesome seeing them jump together. I am bummed I didn't get a pic of them. They were traveling & really moving - we were told this was the J pod (confirmed
J pod
by photos attached to report).
