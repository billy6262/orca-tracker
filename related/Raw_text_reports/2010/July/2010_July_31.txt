============================================================

Entry 1:
In response to Lori Schneider's report from her trip on the
afternoon
off the west side of
S.J.
in the fog, she saw
L87, J27, the J17's, and the K14's
in the fog.

Kurt and I went out with Prince of Whales on the Ocean Magic II out of Victoria last Saturday
afternoon
. It was very foggy - we did see lots of whales off the south end of
San Juan Island
, but the crew were not able to say anything more definitive than "resident orcas." There were several mom/baby pairs and a few big males, with numerous spy hops and tail slaps, and a couple of very close passes near the boat.

At
1152
PT at
Lime Kiln hydrophones
, I heard multiple
S-17 call
along with what sounded like S-33 only in a lower octave. Sounded like a "giggle".
