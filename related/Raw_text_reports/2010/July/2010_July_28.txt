Orca Sightings for July 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a return trip from Victoria, B.C. Ken Balcomb encountered
J's K's and L's
heading North. The encounter began at

11:35a.m
. just south of Lime Kiln State Park (48째 50.367 N; 123째 14.466 W). The encounter ended in
Boundary Pass
(48째 71.271 N; 123째 24.345 W) at

3:08 p.m
.
Center for Whale Research, San Juan Island
*
While heading to the Olympic Peninsula and Southworth, just after departing the Fauntleroy ferry in
West Seattle
@

1:49PM
. I stopped and looked back towards Lincoln Park's, Coleman Pool and noticed a dorsal fin & multiple blows. There appeared to be 1 male dorsal fin and at least 2 females. I observed them for several minutes with binoculars, then lost then completely. They may have been feeding in the tidal rip that occurs off the point very near Coleman Pool.

1:08 a.m.
a few
L pod
calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
.
4:00 a.m. calls of all three pods on the
Orca Sound hydrophones
- some L pod whales had been south and
J, K and some Ls
were coming back down from the north. They passed by
Lime Kiln
starting at about

4:30 a.m.
At

11:00 a.m.
they began coming back up island. It was truly a full
superpod
because today the L-2s were with all the rest of the Community, whereas the other day they did not join them but stayed to the south. Baby K-43 was in the lead with mom Sequim K-12 as they passed by at the park. The pass by ended at about
3:00 pm. with Js and Ks and some Ls going north and most of Ls going back south.

The
afternoon
reports were in. There were ten to fifteen orca [
orcas
] spotted near
Stuart Island
. We traveled north and encountered the orcas near Turn Point. The whales were traveling very close together, heading north towards Pender Bluffs on South Pender Island. The highlight of today's trip was when an adult breached about 250 yards away from our boat.

This
morning
the whales came porpoising down the straits breaching and lunging against what appeared to be a very strong tide and choppy waves- the display lasted for about an hour and a half. Now that the fog has broken up a bit on the west side (

11:15am
) close to shore, there are at least four large lines of resting whales in separate groups slowly making their way back up the island. Given the antics from 5-
6:30 this morning, it is no surprise they needed a rest!"

11:44 -
12:09), most recently from Orcasound. Nice whistles at Lime Kiln & Great S7s and S4 at Orcasound! Lots of automated detections of S2 and other calls and clicks on Orcasound and Lime Kiln between 0359 and 0551.

6pm
. Northbound Pod of
Orca
, I counted 6. One very large male, 2 calves and three or four Midsize - perhaps two females. The Sun was bright around 6pm when I spotted them. I was Westbound in my 17 foot Cuddy heading to Skiff Point for fishing (just South of
Point Monroe
, say three-4 miles. The whales were in 300 feet of water cruising North along Eastshore of Bainbridge Is. There was a Science Skiff vessel with three people on board and a camera just following along. Whales were on surface for some time and then deep for a spell before back on top. No breaching or play time for them, just touring along.

Brad Hanson of NOAA Fisheries got out with the
Transients
off
Seattle
today, they were unable to obtain any fecal samples, but did get some photographs so hopefully we'll have IDs of these whales shortly. They observed 4 orcas, including 1 male - at 6 pm they were heading N off
Pt. Monroe, NE Bainbridge Island
.
The following whales (Transient orcas) were ID'd:
T101, T101A, T101B, and T102

Amy Carey of Vashon Island called to relay a report from a friend on the
N. Vashon Island
ferry who had seen 3
orcas
from the ferry, heading west - including a male, female & a calf, closer to the Vashon side.
*
John Rogstad with WA State Ferries called at
1 pm
to report 1
orca
had been sighted from the Kitsap ferry on the
Seattle-Bremerton
run, 1.5 miles off Alki Pt. heading S/SW. He called back at 2 pm to report 3, possibly 4 orcas sighted from the ferry Tillicum, southbound off Fauntleroy in the Northbound traffic lane.
*
Donna Sandstrom of the Whale Trail reported watching the pod of
Transients mid-afternoon
from Marine View Drive in
W. Seattle
. The whales had been traveling south, but turned north and at around
4:10 pm were off Alki, mid-channel heading north. They also observed a baleen whale with a heart-shaped blow (sounds like a
Gray whale
) at one point - see rest of that report under Gray whales.
*
Three
Orcas
were sighted by the captain and passengers; mid channel headed south at

12:30
on the
Bainbridge to Seattle WSF ferry
. The WSF vessel captain announced their presence and passengers got a show as the whales passed in front of the bow (ferry had slowed to allow them to pass). They were followed by a seal. One was a large male and two smaller animals.

Passengers on the ferry had a real treat seeing [
orcas
] this
afternoon
on the way from
bainbridge to seattle
! a highlight of my vacation for sure! my daughter and my niece were "pretending" to be whale watching from the moment we got on the ferry to bainbridge, so they really manifested their magical thinking! : )

Perry Edwards of BC called Orca Network to report he and Charlie Fleischer on the MV Saltchuck were observing a very large pod of
dolphins
at

3:20 pm
at Lock Bay, NE
Gabriola Island BC
, heading north toward Entrance Island (49 11.819N; 123 47.85W). They were very playful, jumping clear of the water, with gray to white sides on the dorsal fins and gray striping down the sides of the body, and a whiter belly - in consulting his field books he is pretty sure they were Pacific White Sided dolphins.
