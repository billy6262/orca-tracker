Those of us on the
3.30pm
Ocean Magic 2 vessel out of Victoria BC had splendid views of the
J's and the Two K's, K 21 Cappuccino and Raggedy J 40
that were traveling fast south of
Kellett Bluff
towards the 'Whale Park'. The brother and sister were close most of the time when traveling. They were simply awesome in the churning seas.

At about
11 am
, we received an email from Ray Fryberg of the Tulalip Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, saying the
gray whale
had re-stranded in
Tulalip Bay
on the Tulalip Reservation. Tulalip police, NOAA volunteers, and others worked to keep the whale wet and covered from the sun with a wet sheet, and stayed with it while the tide came back up. Ray Fryberg's daughter and Granddaughter went out in a canoe and sang a healing song to the whale. The whale was free floating by around
2 pm
, but not really going anywhere. Then at

4:15 pm
the whale had turned and headed out of Tulalip Bay, toward Camano Island.

1:30 pm
here at
Tulalip Bay, Gray
now completely submerged. Periodic movement, surfacing and weak spouts. Amazing, since we saw it last night at Harborview park, Everett at
7:30pm. Quite a process. Glad it is in a quiet, peaceful area.
And an update: Shortly after my last email from Tulalip Bay, the water was deep enough for the whale to move around and then started swimming at a good pace towards the opening between the shore and shoal. It got stuck again for a bit on the shoal but eventually made it's way around and into deeper water. We left at
3:00 and it was finally on a clear path out of the bay. What a very spiritual experience.
