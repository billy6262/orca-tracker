Orca Sightings for July 2, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
'Mystic Sea' received reports of
Southern Residents
about 20 minutes away but moving south when leaving Cap Sante Marina, Anacortes, at
11.00 am
. Caught up with SR's well spread out
between NAS Whidbey and Smith Island
, later coming across Ruffles (
J1
) traveling alone off Smith Island. More SR's off Lopez, again fairly well spread out.

J Pod
at the bottom end of
San Juan Island
today near Salmon Bank. Lots of foraging.

We met up with members of the
Southern Resident Orca Community
off the south end of
Lopez Island
today. I was immediately able to identify Raggedy (or
K40
). She is easily identifiable because of her "raggedy" dorsal fin. The orcas appeared to be fishing. They were very spread out, traveling in no particular direction, and taking longer dives than usual. We traveled with the animals as they headed toward Cape San Juan. Some of the orcas were traveling in a tight-knit group off the coast of South Beach (on
San Juan Island
) and spent some time porpoising collectively.

Friday at
9 am
this morning we observed
6-7 Orcas
traveling South past Washington State Park by
Anacortes
toward Whidbey in center of channel.

John Rochsted of WA State Ferries called to report
4 orcas
near
Anacortes
, heading south in Rosario Strait at 3 to 4 knots, at

8:58 am
.
*
We came upon
J-pod
as they were southbound, just outside of
Deception Pass
around

10:30 am
. Looked like they were feeding, spread out, moving pretty fast and changing directions frequently. We saw them again south of Lopez Island a little after
noon
, still spread out and with lots of breaching, cartwheeling and lobtailing. We saw
Ruffles, Mike, Samish with Se-Yi'-Chn
(who was imitating mama's lobtail),
Oreo, Doublestuff and Cookie
; there were others, too, who I couldn't identify. As we were heading back into Friday Harbor, it looked like maybe another pod was approaching from the SW? Everyone was so spread out it was hard to tell. Calm waters provided excellent spotting conditions and we saw many porpoises scattered around between Admiralty Inlet and Possession Point; mostly harbor porps but there were a few Dall's too.

I've been on your email list for a while now and have paid particular attention to Monterey Bay sightings as I live in Monterey and have never seen an orca (pretty much the last thing on my list of local wildlife that I'd never seen, but wanted to). Well, today I was heading home from work on the "scenic" route to avoid the San Francisco Bay Area holiday weekend get out of town traffic, so headed from San Jose to the coast and headed down from San Gregorio all the way to Monterey on Highway 1. I stopped at
Moss Landing
to see if the raft of otters was being photogenic - and they were! By chance I decided to go to the main mouth of the harbor entrance to see if anything cool was happening there. As I got there and looked out to sea, I saw spouts silhouetted against the sun - kind of large spouts for what I've seen before, so I started snapping away. When I got home and looked at the photos, I realized that I had seen
orcas
. The photos are pretty bad, as the orcas were a bit offshore and were directly into the sun from where I was standing at the mouth of the harbor, but I've attached a bunch of them (note these are full size crops from much larger photos and I was shooting with a 400mm lens). Time was between

6:50pm and 7pm
- there were
four or five
of them I think, and they kept coming up in the same area the whole time - slightly north of the harbor entrance - and however far out they were (I can't really tell). I noticed in the harbor entrance that sea lions were heading out to ocean, so maybe the orcas were just waiting for them? I'm just happy to have finally seen orcas! Regards,

From Nancy Black of Monterey Bay Whale Watch: Thanks for sending the photos, I have been studying the killer whales in Monterey Bay for 23 years now and know the individuals. I think this group is the
CA51's
, which is mom with her 3 young plus grandkid. When they are around, they tend to hang out around ML more than others do. If you live in Monterey, best time to see them is April and May.
