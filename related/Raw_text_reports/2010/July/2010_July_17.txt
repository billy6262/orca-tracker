Orca Sightings for July 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
As one of our naturalists Lauren mentioned yesterday the whales have been testing our reach lately and today was no different. This morning they cruised quickly up the west side of
San Juan Island
continuing to head north. By the time we headed out of the harbor the reports were saying they were at Turn Point off of Stuart Island. We finally caught up to them at
North Pender Island
in Canada. Other whale watch boats could be seen up ahead but before we made it that far one of our guests spotted some Orcas off our port side. As we watched this group of five we identified them as the grouping known as the
J16's
. This group consists of a female J16 and her 4 offspring. While they mostly traveled they occasionally made us ooo and ahhhh with a tail slap and even a few cartwheels. The fog from the morning had cleared and the whales slowly surfaced making for some nice kodak moments.
