I enjoyed seeing the
southern resident orcas
on
boundary pass
today at

4:30
. They were heading southwest on boundary pass from the northern part of Saturna Island in the canadian gulf islands. Puget Sound Express took us out of Port Townsend for an awesome tour and the whales greeted us with their wonderful playfulness.
