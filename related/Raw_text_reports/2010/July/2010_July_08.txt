Went on a whale watch in the afternoon. The
Minke
was at
3 -4 p.m.
on south side
SJ Island
. We only saw three
orca
. One was
L pod Gaia
. He seemed to be just lazily swimming around
SJ Island
, a distance behind his mom and little brother.

At

4:00 pm
6 orca
passed by at
Lime Kiln
going north. These were the trailing whales, as all others had already gone north. These 6 whales were an interesting group. They were the
L2s and the L54s
. They went north, but not very far and turned and slowly made their way back down island taking a total time of about 1 1/2 hours. It was reported by an observer at the park that about 1 1/2 hours later 2 more whales came south, but it was not known who they were.

Captain Mike informed the crew that we were heading to the west side of
San Juan Island
to look for our infamous Resident
orca
whales. Well, we didn't have to look very hard! We spotted "Cappuccino" traveling widely spread out from the other members of
Kpod
. Cappuccino's distinct V-shaped saddle patch made him easy to identify. His saddle patch, the gray marking beneath the dorsal fin, is "open" meaning that it contains areas of black.
