============================================================

Entry 1:
A treat of an after supper whale sighting this evening. Around

7:30 pm
,
J pod
headed east through
Active Pass
. They were so spread out, it took almost an hour for them to go by. Some tail slaps and spy hops (and more great photos we don't have room for today - look for them in future reports!).

We had a wonderful (and sunny!) day with some of the
Southern Residents
today, 2 miles south of
Eagle Cove (SJI)
. From

11:30-
12:30
we hung out with J-pod (J-1 was easily identified among them) and perhaps some members of K & L. They were breaching and belly flopping, tail lobbing (3 times in a row, on multiple occasions), spyhopping, and rolling. A few calves were porpoising. Whales were in all directions around us for the full hour without us motoring anywhere. A truly fantastic and intimate day with them!

6am
pass-by at
Lime Kiln
. We saw some J's, L53, and L87. It was a beautiful morning with good vocals on the hydrophone.

Started the morning with
calls
on
Lime Kiln
about
6 am
as we readied to head up to SJI to join Capt Jim Maya. While first exploring Lime Kiln Park we heard reports at

12:45pm
from Interpretive Center of
J and L pods
off
Eagle Cove
now heading north. Headed out on Maya's
1:30pm run and needn't go far before we are in the company of Orca. J1-Ruffles just off the westside heading north. At least 3 females nearby closer to shore, Capt Jim thought one must be J2-Granny. Mostly heading north in a resting motion. Made our way south past CWR, County Park and Lime Kiln, spotting whales all along the west side. Maya mentioned J17, J27 Blackberry, J26 Mike and K21 Cappuccino. The entire 2/12 hours we must have seen up to 20 different Orca along the westside from north of Edward's point and leaving them at the entrance to Snug Harbor. Breaches, porpoising, feeding, a spyhop, lot's of pec and tail flapping.
