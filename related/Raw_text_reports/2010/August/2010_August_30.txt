Not sure if you were aware of
4 transient whales
were spotted in front of my house on
Hamersley inlet, Shelton Washington
. This is the second year in a row they have visited to feed on the seals. They were feeding and hanging out 8/29 & back again 8/30. Last year they visited around Sept 4th.

We were NORTH of the Fraser, watching Sockeyes jumping all over the place, and some
Orcas
. By the way, more Sockeyes this year than any year since 1913. Later on in the day, more residents were found heading south near
Pt. Roberts
.

Just came back from my vacation to see a
superpod
going through
Active Pass
!! As usual in the pass, we had breaches, spyhops and tail slaps.

I'm on the west side of
North Pender
, just north of Thieves Bay (48.775311,-123.316898).
Over 30 orca
passed by here, between

12:45 p.m. and
1:15 p.m.
, heading north towards
Active Pass
. There was a tremendous amount of tail slapping going on out there, along with spyhopping and a few breaches. I even saw one of the babies porpoising alongside an adult. They went by rather slowly, and some individuals swam back south and then turned north again. Several large males went by, one probably Ruffles.

Today we ventured to
Active Pass
in Canada to admire those beautiful black and white creatures known as
Orcas
. We caught up to the whales as they were making there way through the pass and out into open waters. There were orcas as far as the eye could see practically! This large grouping was a mix of different pods and they were very spread out. We observed parts of
J pod
with a small grouping of
L pod
nearby. In the distance large splashes were observed as the whales breached and slapped their tails. It was not long before the groups near us were doing the same actions. We even got to observe a few spy hops, which are my personal favorite.

On the west side of

. Lots of
orcas
were slowly headed north, many in groups. There was a breaching contest way offshore.

- Seeing
orcas
on the
Orcacam
! Looked like several whales going north through the straight. Definitely a pod, we think Jpod from the sounds coming from Orcasound hyrdophone. Incredible. Saw tail lobs and other fun stuff. Also saw a baby orca!

Lots of media reports this
morning
of a lone
gray whale
swimming near the Dundarave pier in
West Vancouver
. Approx lat/long coordinates would be: N 49 20.047', W 123 11.266. This is along the North shoreline of Vancouver's outer harbour, West of the Lions Gate bridge, roughly halfway to the lighthouse at Point Atkinson, which demarcates the outer limit of the harbour.
