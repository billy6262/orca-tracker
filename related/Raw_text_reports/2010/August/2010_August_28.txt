I think we arrived at
Lime Kiln
around

1:45
or so. Within moments, blows were spotted to the south. Soon, [
orcas
] were right in front of us delighting all with their presence. It was so cool to be so close to them from land. We could hear them breathe and binoculars were not needed for a good look. My 16 yr old declared the day to be pretty awesome and I couldn't agree more. We saw some tail slapping and a spyhop. Our guide, who was fabulous but who's name I don't recall, said she saw some cartwheeling while they were still a ways out. She also said they seemed to be foraging. We saw quite a few spread over 90 min. or so.

Lopez Island
