Orca Sightings for August 15, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
AM
Trip on the Western Explorer: Enjoyed small foraging groups in the
Salmon Bank Area
. Members of
all three pods
were present with definite ID's of
J2, J27, L22, L89, K40
and many more. It was great to see the whales in relaxed social groups. There was definitely some foraging going on and JB and I were delighted (as only naturalist could be) to see L89 surface upside down while peeing! It was a first for both of us.
PM
Trip on the Western Explorer: I was just reading the reports from the 15th and surprised to see that there was little information regarding the whales activities from when they were at
Pt. Lawrence to exiting Cattle Pass
. Well everything in between was absolutely amazing! We had second hand information that they had come through Peavine Pass heading West. We had heard that they were very active (going nuts). Captain John Boyd and I aboard the Western Explorer picked them up as they came around Upright head by the Lopez ferry terminal. They were in big groups and very active. Many of them hugged the steep cliffs breaching close to shore. Many more had taken a wider path and let me tell you there was no break in the action. It was countless breaches, cartwheels, spyhops, tail slaps, belly flops, you name it it was happening! This continued for the hour that we were with them as they rounded Flat Point and headed into
San Juan Channel
. The Soundwatch crew were champions as they quickly addressed as many boats as possible in this busy channel. We only ID'd a few whales during this amazing encounter, but definitely members of L and K pods including
L-72
, and
K-12
, and
K-34
. As we started to head home we got another glimpse of the whales going by
Goose Island
and then exiting Cattle Pass.

We got to see
L pod
from the ferry today as we were leaving
Lopez Island terminal
! The ferry slowed down, we were already behind as it was, and we got to see and take some nice active shots from a distance off the port side of the ferry. I don't remember the name of that channel there - but it was out from the Lopez Island ferry terminal dock.

At

5:15 PM
this evening a large group of
K and L Pod
whales made their way through
Cattle Pass
, traveling just offshore of the Cattle Point Lighthouse. They were reported in the north end of Rosario this morning, then made their way west through the San Juan Islands and down San Juan Channel. After going through the Pass they started making their way north and offshore, towards the other group of residents. A full list of who I was able to ID as well as some photos will be on my blog tonight.

Lazy, hazy days of summer - seems our spread out
Southern Residents
picked up on that as they foraged near
Salmon Bank
around
1.30 pm
. Ruffles (
J1
) passed by on a mission as did Cappucino (
K21
), while a Mum and baby lolled together in the kelp. This gentle, intimate scene was every bit as rewarding to see as any acrobatic activity.

Dave Robinson called in a report of about
20 orcas
,
1-2 pm
,heading south in groups of 3-4, 50-100' off
Pt. Lawrence ,Orcas Island
.
*
You probably already have this information, but we saw, from Pt. Lawrence,
Orcas Island
, at
1-
1:30 pm 18-20 orcas
, heading south down Rosario Strait, 30-50 ft. off Pt. Lawrence. They were spyhopping, breaching, fluke slapping, flipper slapping, a lot of porpoising--animals were cruising along in groups of 1 to 4-5 in groups, separated by about 30 seconds. They didn't appear to be feeding, just traveling through the area. Males, females, juveniles; there were at least two large males, dorsals around 6 ft. We've never seen whales in this area before--but we don't hike out to Pt. Lawrence often.

Amidst all the fun with whales (orcas) today, we just found a lone
minke whale
foraging off of
hannah heights
approx

4:40
. Several boats in the area stopped to watch at a very respectful distance - nice to have a whale in the area as the residents are further south this afternoon.

This
Gray whale
seems to be enjoying the scenery over on the Canadian side, particularly the Chatham and
Discovery Islands
of late. He/she has been seen frequently, but not always, along the
Oak Bay
waterfront of Vancouver Island, and as far as the harbour entrance to Victoria for the past month or more. It appears to be healthy and able to dodge all the summer traffic, of boats and Kayaks. It is a relatively slow moving animal that enjoys hanging about in kelp beds these days.
