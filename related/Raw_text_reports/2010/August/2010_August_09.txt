Orca Sightings for August 9, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Finally had a chance to send a couple shots of Mondays encounter (
Transient orcas in Admiralty Inlet
) that I wrote you about earlier this a.m., just an FYI confirmation. I did find the locals charts on-line - how I wanted him to be J1, but I know the transients have been hanging around.

I heard
orca calls
from approx.

10:10PM -
10:30PM
. I've been listening for about a year and this was a pod I hadn't heard before in general. Some of the calls sounded similar to what I've heard in the past which I think has been J Pod.

I got a call from Ivan that he had found whales at Hein Bank, so I was feeling much more optimistic for the
afternoon
trip. When we arrived off of
False Bay
, the whales were quite spread in groups of 2-3s, and we found a couple of youngsters who were oblivious to our presence and proceeded to chase each other about, rolling around the surface, spyhopping each other. One was a young male, but when he rolled upside down at the surface, you could plainly see he was a, well, "happy" male whale in the presence of a female!! In other words, a tiny sea snake! Later we had not one, not two, but 3 opportunities to watch J2 Granny spyhop! J1 Ruffles was showing off how to hunt for salmon the tide rips off of Bellevue Point. We also got to see J19 and her calf J41 as they passed by, along with J27 Blackberry off in the distance and J30 Riptide.

Jan Holmes of Whidbey Island called to share a whale report from on board the Western Prince. They saw 2 groups of 6
orcas
off the west side of
San Juan Island
, then another group of 5 with a calf. Some of the whales they saw were J1, J2, & J27, and one of the calves came over to the boat and looked right up at them, then swam under the boat. They had traveled all the way up San Juan Island so ended up circumnavigating the entire island for the trip home.

~
7:30 pm
, one large male dorsal and one smaller
orca
seen from
Pt. Townsend
ferry ~ mid-channel, sorta headed toward Port Townsend, but may have been fishing for seals which were around.

Finally had a chance to check in to see "who" it was we saw from the Keystone ferry Mon evening (

7:15pm
). I can't believe no one has said anything about the little group near Port Townsend. The PT Keystone boat was heading across the shipping lanes back to Whidbey, about midway out, a
"pair" of orcas
made their way in the opposite direction across the lanes, and the ferry cpt announced that they hadn't seen any all summer out there. (It's a wonder the boat didn't list over with everyone dashing to the side!) They made a bee-line over toward Port Townsend, and we could see them blowing just inside Point Wilson. When I looked at my pictures later, it looks like there is at least one more besides the 2, and perhaps a 4th.

Tony Cotter of Hallmark Fishing in
Port Orford OR
relayed that Scott Mecam was out fishing for salmon and found a pod of
20 orcas
swimming fast, heading N, at 42 55.30N, 124 44.42W. There were 3 calves and 2 massive bulls. He didn't see them stop to feed, & also said the salmon fishing was lousy - only caught 9 salmon after fishing all day long.

I am writing to report a sighting of
a large orca pod
for a friend. Scott Mecum, Captain of the the F/V Providence of
Port Orford, Oregon
saw a large pod of 20 killer whales 10 miles off Cape Blanco (Curry County, Oregon). He said the pod was moving north, not feeding. The pod included about 20 whales including 3 cow & calf pairs with small young right next to the cows, 2 bulls, and the rest adults. Best wishes,

milled a bit feeding while we fished, then scooted north up Haro with the flood.
