============================================================

Entry 1:
Bob Heitzman called Orca Network to report a sighting of
2 orcas
12 miles west of
Newport, OR
, mid-morning. He thought it was a mother and calf. The larger one spyhopped five times, once about 40' from the boat.

3 orcas
at
6 AM
, at 47.10.063 X 124.49.312 (about 10 miles SW of

Both Center for Whale Research vessels departed Snug Harbor at

11:00 a.m
. We headed south in search for
L's
reported off
Eagle Point
, but got turned around by the fog coming up island. We turned north and headed for
Boundary Pass
where we encountered
J's K's and a few L's
heading southwest from East Point at

1:00 p.m.
(48째 42.990 N; 123째 08.887 W). We stayed with the whales until just north of
Battleship
and the went south looking for the rest of the L's. After doing a loop from
Iceberg Point to Hein Bank
and then back to the west side we caught up with the J's and K's again off Hannah Heights. The encounter ended there with the whales still heading south at

5:03 p.m.
(48째 28.601 N; 123째 07.740 W).

calls
at
Lime Kiln hydrophones,

.

Turn Point Lighthouse,
Stuart Island
, was the place to be for land based viewing today as numerous members of
J pod
(including Ruffles, Blackberry, Granny, new Mums and babies) passed by at around
2.00 pm
in a flurry of activity. Spyhops, breaches, cartwheels, porpoising, it was a joy to watch. After attending last Sunday's 40th commemoration of the Penn Cove captures, which decimated the numbers of our Southern Residents, it was a salutary moment to see Ruffles, who escaped capture more than once due to his size, escorting his family around the point.

J's and K's
just south of
Turn Point
. Non-stop action! Breaching, tail slaps, spy hops, just a great show! A cartwheel, maybe K26, not sure though and another of a breach with Mt. Baker in the background.

spotted today at approximately

11:30am
, swimming south along
Ten Mile Point, Victoria BC
near Telegraph Bay. Seemed to be 4 whales - one baby i think.

Orca Network received a call from Tony Wilkie, Quartermaster for WA State Ferries Puyallup ferry, reporting
a lone whale
breaching 1.3 miles west of Edwards Pt, near
Edmonds, WA
at

7:15 am
. The whale breached 4 - 5 times, had a small dorsal fin, and was not a humpback. He was pretty sure it was a
Minke
, he had just never seen them breach before.
