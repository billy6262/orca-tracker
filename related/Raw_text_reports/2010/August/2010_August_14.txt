Orca Sightings for August 14, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw what we believe were two
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
playing near the surf off of
Rialto Beach
(near La Push WA, Olympic Peninsula. We've seen tons of Harbor Porpoises in the past but these were larger and lighter in coloring. They were jumping and having a wonderful time.
Elizabeth G. Logue Thank YOU! Cheryl Rose called Orca Network to report a sighting of
5 Transients
near
Mittlenach Island, BC
(middle of northern Georgia St.). There was one big male and a smaller male, a female and two juveniles. The smaller male went through a 20' gap into a bay where the others were and they all ate seals for about 15 minutes.

Vessel Shachi departed Snug Harbor at
7:34 a.m. and Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Stewart Macintyre, and Kathy Babiak encountered whales milling off
Kanaka Bay
(48째 28.96 N; 123째 06.34 W) at
7:53 a.m.
J's K's and L's
were in mixed tight groups traveling slowly north. The encounter ended a mile and a half off
Lime Kiln State Park
(48째 52.19 N; 123째 17.89 W) just before

.

We waited all week for the whales to pass
Point Roberts
, and finally we heard a pod of [
orcas
] between
10 and 11 pm
. Based on the number, direction, and frequency of the blows, there were many whales passing in groups of 3 -4; they were moving steadily South.

In between vessel surveys @
Cattle Point
today I was taking in some vitamin D when I spotted an
Orca
way offshore at South Beach @

3:09 PM
. Two more appeared so I drove to Cattle Point to see the rest. They must have changed direction. I did count 50 vessels from
4:00 to
5:00 at Cattle Point. Amazing amount of vessel traffic due to great weather.
