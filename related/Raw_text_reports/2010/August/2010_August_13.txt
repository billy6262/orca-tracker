To return home after the 3.30pm Ocean Magic trip out of Victoria which was simply "heavenly" by the way, and turn on the
hydrophones
and be greeted with these extraordinary sounds at
7.30pm
, is all rather intoxicating. Not only did we have this super encounter with approximately 89 Southern Resident whales coming in from the west in what is called the 'Super-pod ' experience (but they first had another experience with some
Transient orcas
- see below). From that encounter we connected with some of the
J's and L's
off
Trial Island
traveling fairly swiftly. We then checked out the
Gray Whale
that is hanging out between Chatham and
Discovery Islands
. Finally came the whole
Southern Resident
procession across the bottom of
Haro Strait
. It appeared to be many members of
Js, Ks, and Ls.
AMAZING. Imagine late tonight, as these Orca play and socialize under a dark sky filled with the Perseid meteor shower, August's famous 'shooting stars'. If only we could be there to watch the 'water show '. To think we had three different types of whale in one trip. One can't beat that especially in calm, sunny weather!

Super-Pod
, Southern Resident Orca, coming in from the west and a
Gray whale
as well we couldn't have had a better trip.

We found
4 Transients
blocking our way out of the (Victoria) Harbour. We couldn't even leave the breakwater area as these 4 took a close look on the inside of this barrier.

Last night around

7:45pm
, we were watching some harbor porpoises milling about a mile east of
Iceberg Point on Lopez
when we got a rare treat - a harbor porpoise breach! I'm not sure why, but one of the porpoises decided to leap completely clear of the water, as if one of its partners had goosed it right as it was coming up to breathe. Pretty darn expressive for our normally self-controlled friends.

Orca Network got a call today from Jake McMaster, to report a sighting from about
700 miles west of the Columbia River
, at 46.40N by 140.130W. They saw a
single male orca
, at around
8 pm
. They said it was eating something, but they couldn't tell what. They tried to take pictures but didn't get anything.
*
Mark Malleson IDd the
Transients
seen at the mouth of the inner Harbour of
Victoria
, as the
T101's and T102
. They came into the harbour and skulked along both sides of the Ogden Point Breakwater. Curiously a man in a Kayak was on the outside edge of this breakwater among the kelp beds and he was watching them as they approached. He must have seen them swim beneath his kayak. What a thrill or was it a heart pounding experience. We will never know!

Center for Whale Research staff Dave Ellifrit, Emma Foster, Erin Heydenreich, Stweart Macintyre and Ken Balcomb departed in two vessels and headed toward
Race Rocks
. At

12:46
we encountered the
L2's
in a tight group traveling slowly east (48째 18.312 N; 123째 30.874 W). We then encountered the
J's and K's
in a tight group also traveling slowly east. At

1:26
we encountered all the L's except for the L2's and L87 in a tight group going east. We confirmed that the
new calf in L pod, L115, is L47's calf
. We continued following the L's until they reached mid Haro Strait, off Discovery Island at

5:15 p.m
(48째 27.600 N; 123째 09.022 W). The whales were still in tight groups traveling slowly heading northeast.
