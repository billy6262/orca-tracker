Today the [orcas] were also doing pretty much what they were doing in July--the west side shuffle! Whales had been doing the shuffle since
early AM
, and as we were heading to Cattle Point, we heard the whales were heading towards Lime Kiln again. But we were not very concerned as with the big flood tide coming in, we knew the whales were likely to head back towards
False Bay
. And that's exactly where we found them! First we saw J27 Blackberry, who was doing his J1 Ruffles imitation by hanging quite aways offshore from the rest of the whales. Eventually we were able to find a nice little group of whales off to themselves, so we slowly made our way over. We spotted J39 Mako along with J34 Doublestuff. More whales were closer to shore, but we were staying outside of the 1/4 mile west side buffer zone, so I couldn't get any IDs. J39 and J34 were being very energetic, with lots of chasing and playing around, spyhops, and then J34 did a beautiful breach. You could see that this young male is starting to get the characteristic growing dorsal fin along with the very paddle-like pectoral fins. The whales continued their foraging as we left them still milling around False Bay. We saw lots of bait fish along with several salmon jumping, so perhaps this is why these whales have hung out here for the last 3 days?

Was out on Odessey and circumnavigated San Juan Island. We saw representatives from
J, K and L pods
. An absolutely amazing day. Orcas are so agile, fast and powerful.

We encountered some
Southern Residents
just south of Lime Kiln at approx.

3:30
, heading north. First to pass by us was J32 Rhapsody, followed by a tight grouping of J17 Princess Angeline and her youngest J44 (male), her other two daughters J28 Polaris and J35 Tahlequah, and her new grandcalves, J46 (mom J28) and J47 (mom J35). The 3 calves were rolling on top of one of the adults backs, then they separated off together for a bit of play and juvenile antics playing in kelp, breaching, etc (see photo above). The 3 calves were all born within a year of each other, and they all belong to J17's subgroup so they likely spend most of their time swimming together. Must be a fun family to grow up in, I bet these youngsters will be very close with each other as they continue to grow! Next to pass by (close enough to get an ID) was K21 Cappuccino, followed by J30 Riptide. (Report continued below, under Minkes).
