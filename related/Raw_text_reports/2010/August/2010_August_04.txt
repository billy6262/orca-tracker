In the
morning
I observed
L22
chase down a harbor porpoise neonate. L94 and her calf, L113 joined in the final drowning of the porpoise. All three whales left the neonate floating dead. It appeared to be unmarked.

We saw several animals westbound in the
Juan de Fuca strait
on route from San Juan Island during the

3:30pm
Ocean Magic trip. Lots of activity and a TON of breaching! Almost impossible to see it all never mind get photos of it all. L41 & L74 were in high pursuit of salmon giving passengers an awesome perspective. Big rollers that day so I was amazed that I managed to get what I got ! If you want to see more from the trip you can see it on this blog;
