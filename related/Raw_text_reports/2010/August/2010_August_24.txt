We were now on our way towards
Salmon Bank
just off the west side of San Juan Island to see the Orcas. Well it's been about 4 days since I've seen Ruffles (J-1) and I was very excited to see his big wavy fin today. There was lots of social activity today and members of different pods were seen mixing and mingling. The Orcas were not the only show around though. A
minke whale
appeared traveling right in the middle of the
orcas
. Captain Mike alerted everyone to all of the bubbles appearing at the bow. The water was crystal clear and as he looked down a minke slid gracefully beneath our boat. We were eye to eye with the Minke whale since he was turned sideways staring up - perhaps he was out people watching?

Orca Network received a call from James Noakes reporting
four killer whales
very near Deep Bay, 30 miles north of
Nanaimo
, Vancouver Island, BC, traveling south at
4 pm
.

Position: 54

04N & 166
*
36W, just north of
Dutch Harbor, AK
at
1115 ADT
, spotted five to six killer whales. Seemed to be two large males, few medium sized dorsal fins, and one very small dorsal fin that seemed to be lagging behind. The whales were heading to the east. We do have two bird observers aboard for the cruise and I think they might of snapped a picture of one or two of the whales.
