Between
15-20 orca
seen at
Lime Kiln State Park
. They were mostly traveling north, but several stayed in the waters right around the lighthouse (swimming both north and south) for quite some time between

1:30 and
4:30 pm
. They were feeding on salmon and there were several males among them. The staff at the lighthouse identified them as
J and K pod
whales by the calls on the hydrophone.
