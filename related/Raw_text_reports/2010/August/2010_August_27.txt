1500-1600
we viewed
transient orcas T168, T168A, T168B and T169
traveling SW down
Boundary Pass
parallel to Saturna Island. They were offshore and seemed to be resting. There was only one instance of milling, which was over very quickly and no apparent foraging.

1400-1415
a
minke
whale crossed our path traveling NE across
San Juan Channel
from San Juan Island towards Neck Point on Shaw Island. He was transiting at moderate speed keeping a steady heading.

I spent some time listening to our beloved
orcas
tonight via the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
. I first heard them at
9pm
. They sounded very faint at that time. By
9:11 they seemed to be very close by.
9:13 they began to vocalize more and more energetically.

I believe
all three pods
returned into the area after heading west this
morning
