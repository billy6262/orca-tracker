Out on the Kenai Explorer en route to the Northwest Glacier, we first encountered
Dalls Porpoise
playfully riding our bow. Soon after a Mother
Humpback
and Calf on the North Side of Cheval Island near Aialik Bay traveling and feeding. A few minutes later as we headed further out into the Gulf, a
Pod of Orcas
that stayed with us for awhile. I saw my first calf and a newborn of the season, and the youngster was quite exuberant and did some breaches for us. I love baby orca Breaches. After spending time with the glacier which was quite active yesterday, we headed towards the Chiswell Islands, and in the far distance I noticed some tall blows. What a blessing and we encountered a Mother
Fin Whale
and her calf. Fin Whales are challenging to observe as their dive times can be up to 45 minutes with those huge lungs so we kept our expectations low. Luckily they came up fairly close to the boat, she was huge, it takes forever to see their dorsal fin, yet it was really a special experience for everyone on board to see the second largest creature on this planet.

As soon as we arrived on scene, a bit north of
False Bay
, we saw
orcas
mating, truly an appropriate thing to point out on the 'adults only' Kittiwake. We also saw them breaching, cartwheeling, and lunging. There were several calves in the group and everywhere you looked there was a looming fin of an adult male; a relief because quite recently, there were only 11 adult males for a population of 85 or so. This led to a limited amount of inbreeding, a trend we hope will be reversed as teenage males reach their prime.

6:30 pm
- group of 8 to 12
orcas
, including 2 large males - at least - heading north
between orcas and san Juan
- just west of Jones island. Moving quickly - didn't appear to be feeding - more like passing through. hmm - probably residents, but could have been Transients - anyone else see this pod or get photos?
