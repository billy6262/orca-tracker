Orca Sightings for August 31, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Do you have any idea who the [
orcas
] were that we heard last
night
in the
Sansum Narrows
? I was sleeping out on the covered porch and was woken up at

1:30 am
to the sound of tons of blows. I raced up to the cottage to tell our guests who have been here many times! And they thought the house was on fire! We all ran down to the dock in our PJ's and listened for a whole hour. There seemed to be lots and lots of whales.
(Phoebe talking now) At first you couldn't see anything but then blurry black shapes appeared, turning into fins, getting closer, and then disappearing into the water. There was a sense of awesome power in the whales movements, sounds,and even in the air. You were thankful to see it but also terrified. Later that night an otter family hid under the dock, afraid of the whales but also, like us, in awe.
(This is Anna) It was magical to be standing on the dock with Jupiter shining brightly above with the whales blowing constantly. They were blowing and splashing so much that there were waves lapping at the dock. It sounded like there were about 60 or more whales. In the morning it felt like a dream.

6:30 pm
- I have been listening to some wonderful Orca
calls
and echolocation clicks for the past 60mins on the
Lime Kilm Hydrophone
. Presumably SR's sounds. It must be party time once again, even in the rain.

About

2:30
this afternoon, the first of a spread out, very large group of [
orcas
] entered
Active Pass
, swimming eastward. At one point, there were several different groups in the pass and it was hard to figure out which one to watch. Lots of resting lines, fishing activity, spyhops, breaches, and tail slaps.

About

2:00PM
we observed
five Orcas
just outside
Ladysmith Harbour
(Nanaimo) (N49 00; W 123 48). There appeared to be two adult females, a juvenile female and two young. They exhibited classic salmon feeding behavior and swam around us for about an hour. We got some grainy photos and are trying to identify them.

My husband happened to scan the water
tonight
(even though it was a rainy, dreary day) and he spotted what appeared to be J-pod (but we're thinking more likely the Transient pod that was in Puget Sound? ON) having a major party out in front of our house. We are located just north of
Edmonds
and a little south of Browns Bay. There were
9-12 [orcas]
, and at least one of them was a baby. The pod was fairly close to our shore, and was slowly moving north at

6:45pm
. One of the whales had an enormous dorsal fin, and we're guessing that was probably Ruffles. We saw around 15 breaches (a few of them were babies), a couple of rolls with fantastic pectoral fin action, and too many tail slaps to count. The pod party went on for 1/2 hour, and they all disappeared after that. It was the best whale show we've ever seen, and we've lived here for 8 years now.

Bering Sea
