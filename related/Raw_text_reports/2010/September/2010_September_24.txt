2158
: Calls on both
Orcasound
and
Lime Kiln
hydrophones now. Many repeated S2iii calls at Lime Kiln with distant S19s. Clear calls at Orcasound with quiet background now that ship has passed. Perhaps they're very spread out continuing southward?

We encountered members of
J, K, and L pod
quite spread out in
Boundary Pass
off of East Point, Saturna Island around
3pm
. They were more or less milling about, no real hurry to go one way or another. We positively ID'd
K12, K43 and K7, J26, L95, L5, and L77
. L5 and J26 got a bit "frisky" together, but what was really interesting was the "where" that this took place. There was a huge freighter coming through, and J26 was displaying his "pink sea snake" with L5 right in it's path. I'm horrible with distance estimates, but had they remained in that same spot another 45 seconds or so, I think the freighter would have plowed right into them. They didn't seem to mind it passing by. Odd choice of mood music!
