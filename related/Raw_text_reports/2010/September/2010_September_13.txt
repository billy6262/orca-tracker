Orca Sightings for September 13, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Carrie Newell of Gray Whale fame took us out Monday
afternoon
and we had real luck seeing two
humpbacks
about 4 miles off shore (
Newport, OR
).

Nick Marcus called Orca Network to report seeing
2-3 orcas
about 20 miles off
Cape Vizcaino, CA
, (25 miles north of Ft. Bragg), about
1 pm
, travelling south in water 1600-2000 feet deep. He said two were males.
*
Orca Network received a call from Steve on Fox Island, Puget Sound, reporting a pod of
3 - 4 orcas
near
Steilacoom
, heading south down Hale Passage and the Tacoma Narrows in the evening.
*
The three
transient orcas
that have been reported in
south Puget Sound
paid a visit to
Fox Island
just before
7 PM
last night (9/13). There was one male and two females traveling together. They passed our home on the southeast point traveling east and then turned south toward Steilacoom. The picture only shows the females. The male dove just before the picture was taken. The background in the picture is Day Island.

Captain Craig, Naturalist Sally, and a crew of enthusiastic of guests and I departed Friday Harbor having heard word that their were the mammal-hunting (a.k.a.
transient) orcas
west of
Victoria
. Unsure if we could reach them, we headed that direction with high hopes. As we cruised into the Haro Strait we heard word of a Humpback within our range south of Victoria. So humpback searching we went! As we headed that way, word changed again and transient whales were reported southwest of Victoria. So transient orca searching we went! We finally spotted transient dorsal fins in the distance once we passed Victoria! We were lucky enough to see
2 young transients
(one very young calf), at least
2 (but probably 3) females
, and
T20
. T20 and the rest of his pod, T21 & T22, were involved in one of the only documented altercation between transient and resident orcas. Generally, residents and transients tend to ignore or actively avoid being around each other. They don't interbreed, don't eat the same food, and are thought to have entirely differently languages. In most cases, when residents and transients get within a few miles of one another the groups either pass as if they don't notice each other, or the transients actively avoid the residents. Researchers didn't really understand why this was, until 1993 when a researcher encountered J Pod porpoising at the three transient orcas. It appeared that the transients were clearly attempting to flee the situation. At the time J Pod had a young calf in the pod, J28 (Polaris) and this incident may have occurred because the residents were trying to keep the marine-mammal eating orcas away from their young. No one can ever be certain why this incident occurred, however, so all possible answers will be speculations. Such incidents are rare, but may be the reason the "tougher" seeming mammal eating orcas avoid any interaction with the resident community. It was quite an amazing day. Our guests were very adaptable, going with the flow, and boy were they rewarded for their patience. Today just goes to show (to quote myself on the trip today) - when watching wildlife, you don't know what you'll see until you're pulling back into the harbor. Over and out,

Last evening (about

5:30 PM
) while on our house deck, my wife and I watched approximately
12 orca whales
going north in the
Sutil Channel
just east of south end of
Quadra Island, B.C.
They were making lots of noise blowing. They were in three bunches with each group about 1000 feet apart all going the same direction.
