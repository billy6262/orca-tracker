Orca Sightings for September 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately
1100
[
orcas
] were traveling in large, tight groups while approaching Lighthouse Marine Park in
Point Roberts
. Once they past the park they spread out into to foraging groups. They were moving slowly and it was six hours before they were off East Point, Saturna Island. Even at East point they weren't in a hurry while some changed directions to do some foraging. Quite often it is an approximate 3 hour orca trip from Point Roberts to East Point and I have seen >7 hours taken by them on this route. As all boats were following them down Boundary Pass Lifeforce found a large group of "trailers" on our way home. It looked like L115 close to mom too.

The
orcas
decided to head south just in time for us to see them this
evening
, and far enough south that they were in reach. : ) Lots of Orcas, very SPREAD out. It was a gorgeous evening on the water out in
Boundary Pass
. We picked them up at East Point. Whales talkin, active little ones, and loud bangs from the adults breaching off in the distance. Its amazing the sound they make landing on the water.. Beautiful! On our way back in, a Harbor Seal had a fish in its mouth. It was actually quite cute!

We encountered 15 or so
Dall Porpoise
off
Lime Kiln
. Initially, they were 500 yards away and moving slowly westward. After shutting off our sailboat's motor, they noticed us and started swimming and breathing right off our bow for 10 minutes or so until two small fishing boats passed. Skipper Bill Sproull.
