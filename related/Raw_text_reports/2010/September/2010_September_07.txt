Orca Network received a call from Pauly DeBerry, reporting a pod of
12 orcas
at

between
Tattoosh Island

Cape Flattery Trail
, heading east, just passing through. The pod included some males.

This
afternoon
six or seven
orcas

One of our biologists, Gerry Hayes, took some
killer whale
photos while fishing in
Squaxin Passage
, which is on the boundary between Thurston and Mason Counties. Presumably, these are transients. We were wondering if any of you can ID the male with the serrations in his dorsal fin. Have there been any other killer whale observations in South Puget Sound in the last couple of days?
Gary J. Wiles, WA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife
The orca with the serrated fin is
T63
, "Chainsaw" - visiting the Puget Sound area over the past week - ON
*
At

2:30 p.m.
, a neighbor called to say there were three
orcas
on the south side of
Squaxin Isl
, heading toward Hope Isl. We got in the car and went to the Steamboat Isl. Bridge. We could see the three coming out of Totten Inlet at around

4:15
snugging the far shore. They then headed north and went into
Hammersley Inlet
- almost to Shelton. We eventually lost them and headed back to our homes on Eld Inlet. Within 20 -30 minutes or so, they were IN Eld Inlet at the tip of Cooper Point. They went south into Eld only about 1000 feet and then circled back, across Cooper Point and toward Boston Harbor and that shoreline. They then headed toward Dana Passage - but we lost sight of them because it was way into dusk. We lost sight at around

7:30
.
