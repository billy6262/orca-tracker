Orca Sightings for September 4, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were at
Turn Pt, Stuart Island
after hiking from Prevost Hbr. It was a beautiful day for whale watching and here they came at about

4:15PM
, an estimated group of 20 [
orcas
]. The problem was the whale watching boat which cruised right thru them to locate at the head of their direction, over the course of about a 1/3 to 1/2 mile. The whales soon dived after the boat drove thru them and did not resurface, but were with us for about 45 min. before the whale boat arrived.

Orca Network received a call from Greg Williams, reporting a pod of
orcas
in
Penn Cove
from

9:30 - 10 am
, observed from the Coupeville Wharf.
*
Haro Strait /1/2 mile west of
Henry Island
/

2:45 pm
.
J27-Blackberry
surfaced 'round and around us 10 to 12 times as he pursued a large chinook salmon. We had been sitting at rest for a while when he popped up from the depths and swirled this way and that with the big fish repeatedly giving him the slip under the boat. Everyone on board were thrilled to be so kinesthetically involved in the hunt. He finally caught it about 100 yards off our stern. This is such a rare experience I wanted to make sure it made it into the Orca Network log.

Observed around
12-15 orcas
passing by the west side of
North Pender Island
just before sunset, all from 1/4 to 1/2 miles out from shore in Swanson Channel. Several of them were milling out in the channel, so my count may be off. They headed towards Active Pass. The evening was so quiet that I could hear them breathe, even though they were rather far out from shore.

In one of the pics you can barely see one of the seals they caught for dinner. It was one beautiful day in
PENN COVE
. Greg contacted Orcanet and they will be calling us about our pics. They told us others had spotted them a few days earlier about 10 miles out from Penn Cove but there were 4 of them. We only saw 3 and one of them was a baby Orca.

At around
noon
we had the chance to see many many
orcas
from
Lime Kiln State Park
on San Juan Island. They were spread out all over Haro Strait. Most of them were traveling north but some of them were rather swimming in circles (foraging?).

Residents

very spread out.

Orca Network received a call from Erick Pierson of Pt. Townsend, reporting
Transient orcas
in
Admiralty Inlet
. They saw them first off Partridge Bank, NW Whidbey Island heading SE, then saw them at
4 pm
off Pt. Wilson, NW of Pt. Townsend heading NW. They observed one seal kill, and left them at
4:45 pm, at the Sierra Alpha buoy, heading W/NW.
*
Orca Network received a call from Mary Pacher at

2:18 pm
, reporting
2 - 3 orcas
close to shore off
North Bluff Rd, N. Greenbank
, heading south in Saratoga Passage.
*
With a report of last night's transient orcas still in Penn Cove, Coupeville, we launched 'Hyshka' (named after my adopted orca, J37, meaning 'blessing' or 'thank you' in Coast Salish) and sped off more in hope than expectation. Just beyond
Long Point, Coupeville
, around
noon
, the distinctive dorsal fin of
'Chainsaw' (T63)
came into view cruising along the shoreline with a female and juvenile. We watched the whales for a couple of hours keeping a considerable distance beyond the 100 yard requirement as they traveled along searching for prey. Their typical speed was 8 - 10 mph most of the time except when foraging or milling - lucky Whidbey Island land based viewers filled the air with cries and cheers as they heard the blows and witnessed the wonder of nature. 'Chainsaw' and friends gave us the slip off
Hidden Beach
- in typical transient fashion they just disappeared.

We were kayaking in
West Penn Cove
this morning about

11:00 a.m
. and sighted at least
2 orcas
. The orcas stayed in the area for at least an hour -- West of Coupeville. We drove to the Coupeville Pier later in the day and could still see them as they moved toward Monroe Landing.

8:50 am.
Just got an excited call from Matt Klope (Joan screaming in the background) of
3 orcas
in
Penn Cove
right off Capt Whidbey Inn. One very tall dorsal and two smaller ones. Just milling around there.
