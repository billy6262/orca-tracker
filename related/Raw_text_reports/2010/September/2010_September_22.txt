As we headed down island at

1:30
to watch Orcas, we heard that there might be some Lags out there. Near Hannah Heights, on the West Side of San Juan Is. we spotted them. Amazing! Along with
Orcas
, Lags are a true dolphin, and are so fun to watch. The love playing along side the boats, and will often make eye contact with you.
