Orca Sightings for September 26, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Near
False Bay
on the West Side,
San Juan Island
, it was the
Dall's Porpoise
. Though we didn't get to see them, there were also
Humpbacks and Transient Orcas
out there. Fog always is a problem, but fortunately yesterday it lifted a bit in time for our

1:00 trip
.
