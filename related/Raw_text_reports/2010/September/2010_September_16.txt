Rainy day on the west side of
San Juan
today, but it was a lot of fun! We had a juvenile chase and catch a salmon and then put it on top of it's melon and pushed it around, and a spyhop from
K16
.

Plenty of cetacean education today (say that one fast...) Calm conditions ruled as
Ruffles and Granny
came into view off the west side of
San Juan
around
1.20 pm
, along with other members of
J pod
including Mums and babies. They were foraging in various directions either individually or in small groups, but were never far apart from the rest of the pod. A
minke
made a quick appearance off
Salmon Bank
, and around twenty vocal Stellers were 'giving it large' on Whale Rocks. An extra bonus was a sleepy California sea lion resting on a navigational buoy, plus half a dozen harbor porpoise swimming together and some harbor seals.

Around
3 pm
the Ocean Magic caught up with
L pod
eastbound off of
Victoria
passing Oak Bay on to Discovery Island. The animals were spread apart or grouped up showing some active behavior such as spy hopping (nice view with the city in the background) breaching, tail slapping.
Mega L41
breached almost full out of the water but not quiet, about 200 meters from us.

We started our day seeing
minke
whales and an adorable baby harbor seal swimming around the boat, and trying to climb up our back stairs. We moved on to see
orcas
, lots and lots of orcas! My favorite part was seeing a mom and calf interact and play around it was amazing to see how curious and playful the calf was! Plus we heard orcas vocalizing in AND out of the water and saw so many(/much) peck flaps, tail slaps, spy hopping, breaches, playing around, nuzzling, familial bonding. The
Southern residents
were definitely out and about! Our day ended with a Steller sea lion and both
Harbor and Dall's porpoises
, who were bow riding on another boat, on our way back. You cannot top the day we had with the marine wildlife, especially the orcas. They are clearly such intelligent and playful animals, I'm continually amazed and awed and inspired by these beautiful creatures.

at

3:00 p.m
. (48° 41.12 N, 123° 24.31 W) and headed towards
False Bay
before turning south. At first only some members of L-pod were seen, but later K21 was seen, and he suspected more Ks and possibly Js were present, however, the encounter ended at

5:14 p.m.
(48° 38.46 N, 123° 07.319 W) due to rain.

afternoon
, they were much closer and in the rain.
