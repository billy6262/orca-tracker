Orca Sightings for September 17, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Well the season is drawing to a close here. Many of our migratory animals have already begun their journey either south or out into the open ocean. The Puffins once again become "plain Brown Birds as Captain refers to them and fly/swim out to their middle of the ocean home to bob around all winter. Most of the Humpbacks have either dispersed to some new feeding areas closer to Prince William Sound where there is still some feed before they embark on their journey either to Hawaii or Mexico. In any case I got lucky and hopped on a boat on my Birthday day off was what a day! Sapphire Skies to boot, and even a few Tufted Puffins, although losing their tufts still swimming around. We encountered a Mother
Humpback and her Calf
out near No Name Island in the Chiswell's and we spent some time with them which was sheer luck this late in the season. The day even despite getting caught in a fog bank near Barwell Island was magic. As we reentered Resurrection Bay on our way back to Seward, all the sudden Captain Rich did a complete U-turn and headed back into the gulf. No announcement made at all and I knew it was something bigger than a bird. Gratefully we came upon two rather stealthy
Transient Orcas
, both large males apparently doing some hunting maybe for Dall Porpoise as we were in their area. Anyway what a fantastic birthday it was and a marvelous closing to my Season here in Kenai Fjords.
