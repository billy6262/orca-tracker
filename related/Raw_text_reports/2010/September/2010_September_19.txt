We had a vague rumor of some whales that had passed Eastpoint in the early morning fog--no direction, no confirmation on if they were Residents or Transients. So off we went. Soon we could see a couple of boats that were watching whales. We waited for the whales to pick a direction, and talked to the passengers about whale life histories, and soon we were treated what would turn out to be my second best day on the water for the year! From 1/2 a mile away, we could see large masses of whales coming to the surface simultaneously. They approached closer and closer and soon the waters in every direction seemed to have a whale surfacing. And the surfacings were slow and lazy, zigging and zagging in various directions. It soon became obvious that the whales were feeling very social as there was a lot of upside down swimming, pec slaps, tail slaps, pushing and shoving. And the spyhops! My favorite behavior--one after another after another! Even a double spyhop! It was as if the whales were checking out each boat as they were passing by. And soon the breaching began. It was like a whale behavior primer all at the same time! I was so amazed that I didn't even take pictures. It was such a happy time, and I found myself caught up in the moment as if it were my first time to see whales again. And the passengers made it sound like the 4th of July--or as I call it, responding to "Orca Fireworks"! We saw
J30 Riptide, L41 Mega
(who did some amazingly huge tail slaps!), and it was a bittersweet moment when
L72 Racer
passed by without her calf. Soon an hour had passed, and our allotted time with whales was up, so we slowly headed out of the area and made our way back to Friday Harbor. I think most people had sore cheek muscles from smiling so much.

At approximately
1100
[
orcas
] were traveling in large, tight groups while approaching Lighthouse Marine Park in
Point Roberts
. Once they past the park they spread out into to foraging groups. They were moving slowly and it was six hours before they were off East Point, Saturna Island. Even at East point they weren't in a hurry while some changed directions to do some foraging. Quite often it is an approximate 3 hour orca trip from Point Roberts to East Point and I have seen >7 hours taken by them on this route. As all boats were following them down Boundary Pass Lifeforce found a large group of "trailers" on our way home. It looked like L115 close to mom too. [
Orcas
] returned off
Point Roberts
at approximately
1445
heading South. It was a bit unusual for all three pods to return so quickly as they had been at Turn Point heading South late yesterday and were found up by the Fraser River earlier today. That was a quick turnaround when usually only 1 pod or so may split and head North. This time they were very spread out over miles. They were mostly traveling in small groups.

Fog, fog, fog! Friday and Saturday (9/17-18), fog, fog, fog! Fortunately, the Residents were up North, where the fog is not usually such a factor. This morning (9/19) is a different story. Rain, hail, and fog and then sun and now it's raining again. September is usually such a wonderful month, weather wise and whale wise.
Js, Ks and Ls
coming down from
Vancouver
this afternoon (9/19).

The
T049A's
and
T049B

Constance Bank
off Victoria at approximately
1300
hrs.
