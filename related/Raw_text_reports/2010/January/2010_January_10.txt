============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call at

2:20 pm
from Marilyn Dalheim of NOAA Fisheries - she had received a call from Mark Clark who was fishing and was with a pod of orcas now, close to shore. We reached Mark at
3:10 pm - he said the orcas are in
Oakland Bay, just east of Shelton, WA
- about as far into Puget Sound as you can get! There were 3 orcas close to shore and several others further out, they are just milling in the area. The pod included 1 male.
