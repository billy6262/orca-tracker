Orca Sightings for January 11, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
My girlfriend and I were eating burgers nearby Redondo Beach in
Des Moines, WA
when we saw 4 fins next to each other, as if they were connected!
A pedestrian (no name submitted with report)
This was likely the small pod of orcas, probably Transients, sighted the past week in Puget Sound - sb
