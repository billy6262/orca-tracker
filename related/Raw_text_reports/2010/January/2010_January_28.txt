Orca Sightings for January 28, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Chrissy McClean of the Pt. Townsend Marine Science Center called at

9:10 am
to relay a report of a
possible whale
in distress, seen from the
Hood Canal Bridge
, & reported to the Navy Base. We followed up by talking to Andrea at the base, who had received the call from a citizen, who told her a gray whale was seen by a group of people on the Hood Canal bridge, and it "didn't seem to be going anywhere". Andrea went to the site and searched the area but never saw the whale. Then we received the report below -

I just spoke to Sheila Murray, Environmental Public Affairs Officer, Kitsap Bangor, who believes there was a whale, possibly a
grey
(definitely not an orca nor seal/sea lion), around Indian Island this
a.m
.
