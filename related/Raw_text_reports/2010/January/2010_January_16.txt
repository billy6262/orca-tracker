Orca Sightings for January 16, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I went kayaking this afternoon, putting in at Mukilteo Light House Park, heading north to
Gedney Island
. Around
1.50pm
and roughly 5+ minutes north of the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry lane, as I was paddling north, I was taken completely by surprise by a
gray whale
. The gray whale surfaced about 40-50 feet in front of me, aimed towards the south and almost directly at me and my boat! I heard its blow before I saw it. Stunned by the noise and then the sight of the gray whale, I immediately stopped paddling and marveled at what I saw. I'm guessing this gray was somewhere between 30-40 feet long. After surfacing and exhaling, it then arched its back, showing its mottled and barnacled gray and white back, then raised its tail flukes into the air and finally submerged. About 15-30 seconds after it submerged, I began paddling gently in reverse, backing up towards the south and east. I stopped after a few strokes and waited another 5+ minutes in that area to see if there would be a repeat performance. But it didn't appear again. I'm guessing it must have dove deep (charts show the water there is around 500-600 feet). I'm still buzzing from this surprise run-in with that gray whale - what an amazing encounter! :)

Sharon Heath of Langley called Orca Network at

9:40 am
to report her friend Dan Pruitt had called to report a
Gray whale
off Edgecliff Dr, SE of
Langley
, heading west. She and others in Langley watched for the Gray to appear, but the fog rolled in making things difficult, so no further sightings were reported - however, the report above was likely of the same whale, a bit further south later in the day.
This is a bit early for our "local" Grays to show up, however they came early last year and stayed late, and several new whales stayed around and fed during the spring and summer, so who knows? This is likely the gray that surprised some divers off W. Seattle earlier in the week - sb
