(forwarded by Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research): Just a note that I saw
a whale
in Liberty Bay
Poulsbo
. It may have been a pilot whale or a lone female orca. Much too big to be a porpoise. I have lived here 15 years and have never seen a whale in here.
Here's a bit more info. on the whale reported in Liberty Bay, Poulsbo, WA - it sounds like it wasn't a Gray whale - maybe a Minke? It did have a small curved dorsal fin about 2/3rds of the way back from its head. It was all one color, black, with no white patches. The head was kind of square. It did not look like a grey to me.
