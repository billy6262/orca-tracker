Orca Sightings for January 18, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We are watching a
gray whale
as I write this (

9:45 am
). A whale was first sighted at
9:20am this morning about 1/4 mile off of
Tulalip Shores
. There could be two whales, as we observed a second, smaller blow within a minute of the first one. At
9:42 the whales are heading northwest and are about 1/2 mile off shore in the waters between Tulalip Shores and Spee-bi-dah.

More
Transient calls
on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones
- very faint. They started again at

9:46 pm
until

10:12 pm
. The calls were getting long and drawn out - almost continuous - for a couple minutes, very unusual to me, then a couple of the same calls like we heard earlier.

I believe I am again hearing very faint
Transient orca calls
on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophones
, beginning at
8 pm.
They are so faint I have my speakers turned up all the way to hear them, but have now heard them several times, so think there are some orcas somewhere in the distance off west San Juan Island!
