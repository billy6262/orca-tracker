Orca Sightings for January 2, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
After receiving a report of
orcas
inbound off
Pt. Townsend
, we got in the car and headed to the west side to see if we could find and ID them. We arrived on Keystone spit at

1:55 pm
, and saw several orcas between Admiralty Head and Ft. Flagler, foraging and milling, but generally heading south. We went up to the bluff at Ft. Casey State Park, and watched from

2:05 -
2:45 pm. We observed at least 15 - 20 orcas, including 2 - 3 adult males, very spread out heading south. By
2:40 pm they had all passed Ft. Flagler, so we headed down to Lagoon Pt. We watched the orcas pass Lagoon Pt. from

3:05 -

4:05 pm
- still very spread out, with milling, foraging, a few direction changes and tail lobs but continuing south. We went to Bush Pt. at
4:15 pm, and they continued traveling south, spread out - the trailers were between Foulweather Bluff & Mutiny Bay by
4:30 pm. We met a couple on the beach who had watched an earlier pod pass by at
3:45 pm - some were much closer in, others further out. We left at
4:35 pm as it was getting too dark to see the spouts in the distance as the whales continued south toward Puget Sound.

I am so excited to report that I saw a
gray whale
this afternoon (
1335
PST) just off shore at Saltar's Point in Steilacoom, WA. It surfaced two times as it swam north towards the ferry terminal. It was only about 20 feet from shore the first time I saw it surface. I have read the reports of people seeing them around Eagle and Fox Island and have been keeping my eyes out for them - what a surprise to see them so close to shore! No pictures where taken. Again, thanks for all you do.

My name is Kate and I am a deckhand for Sanctuary Cruises out of
Moss Landing, CA
. Today we spotted a group of
5 transient Orcas
who had just killed a sea lion. We often saw the female with the jagged dorsal fin with parts of the carcass in her mouth. The pod was very active, swimming right along side the boat several times. One appeared to be doing "hand-stands"- frequently sticking its flukes straight out of the water. We often see this male, the one with half of a dorsal fin, near Moss Landing. It was a wonderful experience! We found them at: 36'47.3, 121'54.8. They stayed in the same general area from 11am, when we picked them up, until

12:15
when we headed in.

Monterey Transient orca IDs from Alisa Schulman Janiger: The photo here shows
CA219
and another whale (jagged fin) that I cannot ID from this image. The only other images that I have of it were taken at sunset this year (no saddle detail); it is probably a known whale with a drastically altered dorsal fin shape. The photo (from our Jan. 2nd Whale Report) shows
CA217
(male) "Chopfin" or "Stumpy". Female on the left looks like CA216. We first saw these whales in 1998.
Also, more ID's & info. on the Jan. 2nd Monterey Transients from Alisa Schulman Janiger: If you had the same whales on both days, I think that you actually had at least 6 whales. Also, did you notice if there another whale present: a small juvenile that might not have been photographed? If so, then you had seven whales. Whales shown (from photos submitted by Kate Cummings):
CA216, CA218, CA219
, Jagged Fin, another female, and CA217 (Chopfin). I'm still not certain who Jagged Fin is; I think that she may be a large juvenile (same size as CA219, who is a large juvenile). I have her (Jagged Fin) on another day last year with several of these same whales; I think that I might have her in 2007 (pre-jagged). I have seen most of these whales down here, but they are usually sighted off Monterey. CA216 - CA219 were first sighted off of Santa Catalina Island in
December 1998. CA217's dorsal fin was flopped over to the right - but still intact - at that time. I think that his fin was wounded (probably by a prop) in 2007. CA217 wanders about, and is spotted with a few different matrilines. He has been sighted off of Washington - keep a look-out for him!
