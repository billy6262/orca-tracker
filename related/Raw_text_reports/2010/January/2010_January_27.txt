Orca Sightings for January 27, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
For two days (
January 26 and 27),
J1
has been seen alone in
Haro Strait
, and heard on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
making what sounds like plaintive repetitive calls (S42 and S40) when no other whales were in sight or hearing range of the Haro Strait hydrophones. Such a solo appearance was considered unusual, so on 27 January Dave Ellifrit and Ken Balcomb headed out in r/v "Orca" to check on J1's condition. He was swimming steadily north in Haro Strait off Battleship Island taking four or five breaths at the surface and then diving for six or seven minutes when we found him. He paid little heed of us and appeared to be in good health with no apparent injuries, so we left him on his way off Stuart Island as he was apparently heading toward Swanson Channel.

OrcaSound/Lime Kiln Hydrophone reports from today:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called to alert us that
calls
began again on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
at about

11:30
. Sounds like the same calls as yesterday, but we also heard a different call in addition to yesterday's call, and so far, sounds like just one whale again.

I am hearing a slightly different
call
from yesterday. Yesterday was one short high pitched note followed by a longer low pitched note (the s-42), today I am hearing just one high pitched note - so far. Started recording at

: Thanks, Susan. All quiet since your locate post, but here's a link to a recording of
calls
detected by Val's algorithm at
Lime Kiln
at

11:31
. It's got information all the way up to 18kHz on the two calls: S42 and the new one. Anybody want to chime in on the new call type? Also, there were no automated detections last night at Lime Kiln, Orcasound, or Port Townsend. Best,

The other
call
sounds like S40.

12:36: Calls
being heard at
OrcaSound Hydrophones
. Sounds like the same S42 being heard.

Seems like Ruffles is making the rounds, solo. Thanks to Laura Swan for this clip of 6
calls
made at

11:34
. Monika thinks the new calls we're hearing are S40s. Here's 3 examples from Ford/Osborne. One of those (S40) calls was recorded by the computer between two S42s. Here are two other automated detection recordings from Lime Kiln: 2 S42s An S2? Jeanne Hyde reports spotting only 1 fin, possibly rippled, way out in Haro northbound near/north of Sidney Island, so listen on Orcasound hydrophones, too, today. Laura/Cathy heard/recorded ~6 more S42s at OrcaSound at ~
12:37.

Today at about
noon
I saw
Ruffles
northeast of
Sydney Island
traveling from the north, coming 'down island'. He soon changed direction to the east and then back again offshore and then changed direction again and moved north until finally disappearing from view. Hoping as I did, I did not see any other whales.

Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research reported he was with
J1
today in
Haro Strait
, traveling north with him up to Battleship Rock off N. Henry Island. Ken left as J1 continued north, Mark Malleson continued on with J1 up to Turn Point, where J1 continued north - still making calls.. Ken had heard two orcas had been sighted earlier in the day off the west side of Moresby Island, but that report was not linked with J1.

Orca Network received a call from Tony McGinnis reporting 5-7 adult
orcas
, and 1 small one in
Malaspina Strait
, [Georgia Strait] 2 kms SE of Myrtle Rock heading east at

10:30 am
