Orca Sightings for January 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were kayaking from the Longbranch Peninsula to Eagle Island today and at two different times saw large,
black marine mammals
with distinct dorsal fins swimming toward Pitt Passage(between Key Peninsula and McNeil Island, So. Puget Sound). They were moving fast and only surfaced dolphin style twice on each sighting. Three individuals were seen at about

1:00 PM
and at least two others at

3:30 PM
. An individual in the second group appeared to have a larger dorsal fin than the others. All of the sightings were just off the Longbranch Peninsula shore about 1/3 mile north of the Longbranch public boat launch. We were at least a mile out in Drayton Passage, but they were clearly visible with binoculars.

Adam U submitted these photos and amazing report from a friend who is a Navy Pilot: We were flying around the
Gulf of Oman
when we spotted what looked like a dorsal fin. It was bigger than a dolphin so we were hoping for a shark but our crewman hanging out the cabin said he thought they were
killer whales
. We ended up following them for about twenty minutes. We spotted nine of them, some of which were juveniles or at least a lot smaller than the two biggest ones.

Kari and I had three more
humpbacks
. We were kayaking just north of
Los Barilles, B.S., Mexico
and spotted them on the horizon. We paddled a mile or two off shore to confirm that they were humpbacks but didn't get closer than at least a half mile. We saw about a dozen surfacings before heading back to shore to snorkel. Also saw what we believed was a small group of dolphins in the distance from this location as well!
