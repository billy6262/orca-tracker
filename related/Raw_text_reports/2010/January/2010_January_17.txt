Dead
Sei [
Brydes
] Whale - A photo was taken on 1-17 off the northern tip of
Hartstene Island
. Cascadia Research identified it as a Sei Whale, probably a yearling, that may have been killed at sea and brought into Puget Sound on the bow of a ship. It appears to be 30-35 feet in length.

Hartstene Island
