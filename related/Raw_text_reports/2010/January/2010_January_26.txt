Orca Sightings for January 26, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another wonderful trip with Prince of Whales Skipper, Mark Malleson this afternoon. We headed out west at
1pm
, looking for the
Transients
that Mark has seen from his on shore look-out two hours earlier. We had to travel a fair ways out west to encounter these elusive animals, but there they were, just as Mark had hoped. The
T30's and T17
2 were identified, five animals in total. Encountered approximately 3 miles south of Sheringham Lighthouse along the west coast of
Vancouver Island
. They were play hunting with a seal, without taking it down. They created some sizable swells around the seal, but the little seal kept bobbing along the surface. When they tired of their game they headed further out west. Most interesting behaviour.

Hearing faint
calls
at
Lime Kiln hydrophones
beginning at

12:21 p.m.
.

That's a very unusual repetition of a sort-of familiar
call
at
Lime Kiln hydrophones
. I think I'm hearing partial S10s even fainter. What do others think? Southern residents? Here is a link to a file auto-detected slightly earlier further to the north at Orcasound hydrophones. Cheers,

12:48 pm
: Perhaps it's just me, but it SEEMS to be just one animal making this
call
, does it seem that way to anyone else?

1:20 pm:
Jeanne just called reporting a single male passing the
Lime Kiln
lighthouse going south. She got photos and will attempt ID, but said he looked familiar. She is scanning for other whales based on our hearing other calls, substantially fainter, like this probable S10 caught by the computer. I think the repeated call sounds like an S37, slightly modified with a bit more of a high-frequency start. For those who missed the live show before noisy ship, here is a recording (10Mb). Fascinating catch, Suzy!

Sounds T(ransient)-ish to me, but I didn't get to hear the other distant
calls
.

1:28 pm:
Okay I am going with Scott, sounds like a variation on the S37 call.
Jeff Hogan, Seattle

1:45 pm:
Laura Swan suggested S42 for the repeated
call
, then Jeff reported Candi had also said it was an S42. Upon listening to this Ford-Osborne clip, I concur. Compare with the attached clip of today's repeated call from Jeff. Monika (Wieland)'s thesis associates S42 with all pods (past and present periods) except L pod presently, and also states: "S1, while still the most frequent call type made by J-Pod, fell from approximately 38% of all calls in 1978-1983 to 25% of all calls in 2005-2006. Other calls that underwent sharp declines in occurrence include S2, S4, S7, and S42, whereas S3, S10, and S37i drastically increased in occurrence."

Jenny Atkinson also reported a lone male southbound: "We saw it too --
lone male
, traveling south. Watched him travel from
Lime Kiln to Sharon Grace's (Hannah Heights)
-- he kept going, we headed back to town. We did not see (or hear blows) signs of any other whales." And there's a recording that Laura started 5 minutes before the one I provided previously.

Quite a bit of excitement this afternoon. I saw
Ruffles J-1
at about

12:45
coming south a couple miles from shore between
Kelp Reef marker
and
Lime Kiln lighthouse
. He was traveling in 'his' slow methodical manner - a few shallow dives and then a longer dive - heading down/south. I didn't not see any other whales though I scanned for two more hours. The photos are just proof of presence that Ruffles was out there today.

Here's a note from John Ford re the repetitive calls we heard today: "Interesting recording. The attached clip certainly appears to be a sequence of S42s, though the limited bandwidth cuts off the distinctive terminal high frequency component. I assume that the visual account of the lone male is to imply this was the source of the calls? This would make sense, as I've often heard whales that are traveling apart from the rest of the group repeat a single call over a long period in a similar fashion, though mostly just in the northern residents. This kind of repetitive calling is usually associated with high excitement levels."

Saw them again today -
T30s and T172
still cruising around the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
.
Kyla Graham, Victoria B.C.

I spotted a small group of killer whales from the shorleline off of
Victoria's waterfront
at

11:30
. Kyla Graham and myself went out to get an ID on them and found the
T30's with T172
west bound at
1330
, 2 miles south of
Race Rocks
. We left them milling at 1445, 5 miles south of Becher Bay. Thanks again to Gord Rowles for tracking them for us while we launched the boat.

9 am:
Just now a friend reported that he was seeing a whale in Mystery Bay (
Marrowstone Island
). He said it small, not an orca,
gray
colored, about 20 feet long, and did not see a dorsal fin.

From about
3 to
3:30
we observed a single
gray whale
about 30 yards from shore just adjacent to the Ebey's Landing Bluff Trail (west/central Whidbey Island). The gray gave us a rhythmic display of surfacing twice for air every 2 minutes or so. It was casually swimming in the vicinity of the lagoon and showing us a good portion of its back on its diving breath. We stopped to watch the surfacing pattern all the way from the beach up to the top of the bluff trail in spite of the glare off the water. Witnesses in our party were Adrian Archer, Jackie Durban, Greg and Kathy Sivertsen and Cathy d'Almeida. Dan d'Almeida, Coupeville, Whidbey Island
