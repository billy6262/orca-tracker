Orca Sightings for October 7, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
This
afternoon
, we had
orcas
slowly headed south through
Haro Strait
. Most were well away from shore, but J-1 and a few others were within camera range. Here is a photo taken from shore on the west side of San Juan Island.

Lots of chatter on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
still at
1535
hrs. Sorry to anthropomorphize, but it sounds like orca karaoke, I can imagine them with mike in hand, they are so loud and vibrant!

Saw these
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
off the ferry from
Horseshoe Bay BC
this
morning
. They were having a bunch of fun.

We have the pleasure of listening to Southern Resident

2:10 pm

Orcas
can be heard, close and far off, on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
right now. Sweet.

1333
: So. Resident (S1/2)
calls
intense at
OrcaSound and faint at Lime Kiln hydrophone
- J pod heading north. Update: The sequence of auto-detections and Laura's observations, the whales are southbound, not northbound as I just reported. The Beam Reach boat, however, has been with Killer Whales heading northward from Eagle Point to Hannah Heights over last hour. Happy listening,
