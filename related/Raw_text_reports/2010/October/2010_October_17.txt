We saw anywhere from 10 to 12 Orcas proceeding from

(south side) in a southwesterly direction toward Pender and beyond. Three were beside us then saw several more in the distance and then some more a little back. Around

3:30 p.m
.

I have found the whales via hydrophone
Orca Sound
. a few far away calls at the
Lime Kiln site
and at the more northern Viers site, they are loud and clear, heading south along
San Juan Island
. Today we went all the way up north to the west entrance of
Active Pass /Mayne Island, B.C.
and as we arrived (

2:15 pm
), there THEY were, barreling towards us, the first group just about to come around the point, heading WEST of all things, and right along the shore! We immediately shut off the engines and a parade of leaping, spy hopping, tail lobbing, and pec slapping family groups continued for twenty minutes passing along the emerald green shores' placid waters. The sea and air was so still we could smell the salmon oil from their breath! All three pods represented. Though it was rather visually overwhelming to catch ID of individuals, what with their sheer numbers and swift pace and closeness, I did spot J1 & 2, K21 & 40 , new mom K12 and tribe, L2 or 26 and LOTS of others including little'uns and teen sprouters. Including some photos that might give you all a flavor of this amazing golden experience (see above photo). I will look forward to this fall,winter, spring, Orca Network reports to know what's happening until I'm out on the sea again 2011 season. Now,

7:40 pm
: whales very audible at both North and Lime Kiln hydrophones.
