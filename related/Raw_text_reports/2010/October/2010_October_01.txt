Passengers on the

7:55 am
ferry sailing from
Vashon to Fauntleroy
were excited to see many
Orcas
, I assume one of the resident pods, moving in the center of the Sound. We could see multiple splashes and whales surfacing in several places at once. The vessel came to nearly a dead stop, the Orcas moved off to the east, we started again only to come to a stop a few minutes later, once again quite close. I'm not good at estimating distances, or observing orca behavior, but we could see the difference in dorsal fin sizes well and one big guy was distinctive, close, and easy to track from place to place. They seemed to be heading south. Many passengers came out on the deck -- one person said "in 30 years commuting on this ferry, this is the closest they have ever been." It was the best look I have ever had at the orcas, a great start to the day.

What a lovely way to start the month--
fins
going by at
7am
! First spotted between
West Seattle
, just south of
Alki Point
, and the north end of Blake Island, spread out and moving southwest. They were too far away to see saddle patches but I'm pretty sure L87 Onyx was among them, and a little later Ruffles came past--the light was perfect for picking out the ripples in his dorsal. Looks like they were foraging along the way. Ruffles spent about ten minutes in one spot, making lots of u-turns and rolling on the surface, before continuing on toward Vashon.

Calls on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
from

22:21
detected by Susan Berta of Orca Network, and Cathy W. Auto-detections continued until

22:29:23
. Lots of S19s more intense (closer?) with many S2s fainter (more distant), so not sure if this was L pod coming in, J+ pod going out, or both?! Also a few male harbor seal vocalizations.
