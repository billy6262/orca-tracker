Orca Sightings for October 19, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit, Erin Heydenreich and Debbie Sharpe of the Center for Whale Research spotted
T20 and T21
off
Kelp Reef
from the Center at

1:15 p.m
. We shortly departed Snug Harbor and encountered T20 and T21 just south of Sidney Island, B.C. at

1:53 p.m.
(48째 34.624 N; 123째 14.776 W). At
2:21 p.m. we observed the T's chasing a harbor seal. The attack appeared to be successful. The encounter ended just off Halibut Island at
3:05 p.m. (48째 37.580 N; 123째 16.128 W) with T20 and T21 heading slowly north.

Orcas
moving from
Admiralty Inle
t into Puget Sound between Northern tip of
Kitsap County and Whidbey Island,

3:30-4 PM
. First seen from Norwegian Point Park (Hansville), close to Whidbey Island in vicinity of Useless Bay, cruising back & forth. I think there were 6, in 3 pairs, although there could have been only 2 pairs with one of them doubling back a lot. At least 2 males. Visible with naked eye but very exciting through binoculars. Then they all headed South into Puget Sound, very fast. We moved to Point No Point to join a small crowd already watching from there. They seemed to be making a beeline for the Edmonds area and soon were too far away to see. Other lookers said they had seen them in the same area several times in the past few days.

From
Edmonds
bluff just north of the Ferry from

5:30-
6:40
we watched the
Orca
, they were spread out across mid channel and stretched to Possession Sound from the point south of Useless Bay then heading slowly in a general direction northeast. Crossing in front of Cultus Bay and to south end of Whidbey. General milling, some feeding behaviour (we think) and I did see one breach, Yay! At the same time saw
15-20 porpoise
, porpoising along in a mostly single-file-line 1/2 mile off Edmonds bluff north of Ferry. Either Harbor or Dall's. Exciting afternoon down here.

We were wondering where the whales went today and were listening to the
Pt. Townsend hydrophones
, just wishing and hoping, when we finally began to hear a few
Southern Resident calls
at
1 pm
. They only lasted a few minutes, and we'd had no reports of whales today, but we alerted folks in the area and then headed over to the west side of Whidbey to take a look. We departed from Lagoon Pt. and thanks to the tip from Sandra (see report below) we knew the whales were heading south down Admiralty Inlet, and we saw them foraging and breaching off
Bush Pt.
at about

2:45 pm
. The leaders were approaching Double Bluff by 3 pm, closer to the Whidbey Island side, but we could also see small groups spread out all across Admiralty Inlet. By
3:15 pm the orcas had moved closer to the Kitsap side, and were spread out between N of Hansville to Point No Point, still foraging. At
3:40 pm, the whales continued south, VERY spread out in small groups from Double Bluff to Pt. No Point to Possession Pt., then at about 4 pm they just all suddenly disappeared! We had to head back to Lagoon Pt. at that time, so left them heading toward Puget Sound.

Heeding the 'Orca Call' at
1.20 pm
that Orcas had been heard on the Pt Townsend hydrophone, I headed for
Bush Point, Whidbey Island
. I heard the whales before I saw them, it was quite surreal. Then into sight came Ruffles in the lead with other family members not far behind, traveling steadily south. Susan and Howard were at Lagoon Point so glad to have confirmation of the direction of travel. One of the babies breached in front of me as if to say, 'hey, look at me!' The only sounds besides the exhalations on this beautiful fall day were the slaps of tail-lobs hitting the flat calm water as the Southern Residents passed close by the point before disappearing into the haze. Magical.

Orcas
just south of
Bush Point
(SW Whidbey Island) almost to mutiny bay but not quite. Neighbor just hollered up to me to come look! Really BIG orcs, lots. Feeding and putting on a show just south of my place. The Windmill area will be excellent viewing.

Janice Longstreet (sp?) called Orca Network to report sighting ~6
Orcas
from
Pt. Wilson, NW of Pt. Townsend, at
12:30 pm
, heading toward Seattle. She said the pod included a calf, and also that 4 porpoise or dolphins were traveling behind the Orcas.
