At approximately

6:15 pm
, a pod of
25-30 Orcas
went by the east side of
Blake Island
. They were very spread out but many were very close to shore. The whales were very active with a lot of tail slapping and breaching! They put on a great show for the boaters and campers. After passing Blake, they headed south towards

I'm way up on the bluff above Richmond Beach, but I think I see at least

15-20
spread out all over this area now that I have a better view.
