============================================================

Entry 1:
3-4 orcas

West Seattle

10:35
.

I was watching the water off
West Seattle
in the morning. A little before
10 am
I did see a small pod of
Dall's porpoise
heading south. That was north of the Fauntleroy Ferry route, but if they continued on to the south they would have been in that area around
10:35.

Approx 10 minutes ago (

10:20
?), just had one
minke
foraging off the north side of
Hannah Heights
(W San Juan Island). It came incredibly close to shore, surfaced and then disappeared. Typical slinky minke! :):) and also just got word there were/are
two humpbacks
two miles south of
Hannah Heights
.
