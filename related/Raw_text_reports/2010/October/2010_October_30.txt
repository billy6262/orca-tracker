Orca Sightings for October 30, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Traveling on the Anacortes to Sidney ferry, we are pretty sure the fast moving flurry of activity seen from the starboard side west of Spieden was
a dozen Pacific White-sided Dolphins
. Also a couple more noted approaching Friday Harbor.

The Strait of Juan de Fuca, south and west of Victoria BC seems to be a magnet for Humpback Whales. Although there wasn't much sun around between
12-3pm
we were blessed with
6 Humpback Whales
in two separate groups. Our sightings included, 'Heather', the female with her calf and Split-Fin once again. They were foraging a little and traveling very close together at times.
