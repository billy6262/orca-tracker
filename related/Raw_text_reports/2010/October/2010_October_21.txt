Orca Sightings for October 21, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
A tuna fisherman, Richard Nehmer, called to report watching 8
orcas
, including at least one male, killing and eating
Pacific white-sided dolphins
, 45 miles west of
Crescent City CA
, the afternoon of 10/21. He said it occurred at a temperature edge of 4 degrees difference (where cold La Nina water upwelling along the coast meets warmer Pacific surface water) and he thought the kw's had cornered the dolphins there. He said after the predation event there were dolphin lungs left on the surface. He said the 8 orcas split up into two groups after they finished the dolphins. He also said there were other dolphins there during the event that were not eaten, which from his description could have been Northern right whale dolphins. One of the crew took photos and he'll try to get them emailed to Orca Network.
