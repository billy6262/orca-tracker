I have a poster that requests sightings of all orcas, so I thought I would email about
2 orcas
(one male and one female) I saw today off the
Big Sur coast in California
. The location was off Laffler canyon. The approximate location is: N 36.19, W 121.73. They were about a mile from me while I was standing on shore. There is a sea lion hang out spot in this area where there were hundreds of sea lions in the water and on shore today. This was at about
0945
. I was watching them with binos and didn't get a look at any saddle patch or distinguishing features. They did not appear to have a successful feed and were not preforming any behaviors while I saw them. I stayed there for about an hour and they never really left the area but also were very elusive, most of the time very hard to locate. The sea was very calm, there were no white caps and a swell smaller than 5 feet. There have been orca sightings in this area that I know of, but this is the first time I have seen them in big sur. It is possible that there were more than the 2 orcas but I am not sure and can only confirm the one male and one female.
