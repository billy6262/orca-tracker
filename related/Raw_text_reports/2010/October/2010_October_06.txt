Orca Sightings for October 6, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We saw
K40 "Raggedy" and K21 "Cappuccino"
at the beginning of our trip (approx.
1400
). Then we came across
K14 "Lea"
and her son,
K26 "Lobo"
actively fishing off False Bay. After spending some quality time with them, we found her other two kids -
K36 "Yoda"
and
K42 "Kelp"
playing offshore. When we met up with the kids, their behavior seemed to be a bit strange. There was lots of playing going on, but they weren't going anywhere - they were staying in the same little spot. As we looked closer, we noticed they were very excitedly playing with a dead harbor porpoise!! They were breaching around it, spyhopping next to it, slapping it with their flukes, and carrying it on their heads. It was almost as if K14 "Lea" had told the kids - "Okay, big brother and I are going fishing. You two stay here and play with this porpoise..." We watched this for over 45 minutes and it was still going on when we left. We enjoyed a visit from
L88 "Wavewalker"
on the way home.

1:00
. We were enjoying a sunny day at the San Juan County Park and the
Orcas
paid us a visit. Noted about a dozen with 2 bulls moving very slowly and spread way out, traveling north. Several whale tour boats accompanying them. They were pretty far out, so any identification was difficult. Made our day!
