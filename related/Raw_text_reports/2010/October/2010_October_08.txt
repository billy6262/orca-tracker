Orca Sightings for October 8, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
I have been encouraged by a crew member of one of the whale-watching boats on
Monterey, CA
to submit the following to you for information and identification.
Five orcas
were seen in the morning, including the following.

Mark Malleson responds after seeing Geoff's photos: One of the
CA transients
seen in Monterey (jagged trailing edge) was in the group that Ken and I saw on
November 12 in Monterey while out with Richard Ternullo during the A.C.S. whale watch trip. I believe that it is part of the CA116's. The bull with the chopped off dorsal was not seen that day but according to Alisa Schulman-Janiger he normally is with them and they are the most frequently seen group in the area.

It's nancy and tony out on
harstine island
again. (btw - we are on the SOUTH end near briscoe point looking across dana passage to olympia (dickenson point area according to the placemat chart; lol). the channel isn't very wide but not well lit at night. (some moon light would have been helpful). but last night and night before (oct. 7th and 8th) we heard them out there again, but no visual. We are such rookies at this that its hard to say but it seemed to us both that there was only 1 or maybe 2 whales each night. our biggest thrill yet was (10/8) around
5:00. we actually got a glimpse of 1 in the daylight! :) what a thrill! he was cruising fast. just kinda barely surfacing to get quick breath periodically but not stopping or showing off like the north sound whales seem to do - lol we didn't even get a flick of the fluke. haha but we were so grateful for his (her?) appearance just the same. we are quite sure it was alone (do u call that a rogue?). he moved quickly and efficiently. seemed like he stayed right near surface but only came up slightly a couple times to breath. but he even did that quickly and without a break in stride. his dorsal fin was pure black (are they all?) but we couldn't see any specifics on markings. tried to get pic but was hindered by my inexperience. he was headed north/northwest.(glad he was on the run and not hunting - my little harbor seal friend was still out here today. (
This was probably the minke whale reported Oct 10.
)

Bruce Ladd saw
8 orcas
, 5 or 6 miles offshore of
Point Sur CA
, including two males, in a tight group heading east.
*
We see a large group of
orcas
scattered over a large area north of Edmonds ferry and south of
Maxwelton (SW Whidbey Isl)
. It appears they may be headed into Saratoga Passage to the east side of the island?? They seem to be feeding (see blows and fins but they are way too far away to see any details. (

6:30 p.m.
we are straight across from Hansville in Cultus Bay north of Maxwelton Beach). Update at about

7:55 pm
: they definitely went around the corner headed your way!

Watching a great show south of the
Eglon Boat
ramp, near
Kingston
. It's about

4:45
. Seems to be two groups, one of 4 or 5 going north towards
Pilot Point
and one of 3 to 4 feeding on the west side of the shipping lanes. Appears to be one small
orca
in each group with at least one male. The group that is feeding have been out there for 45 minutes. They are now heading east but look like they are still feeding. The only marks we could see is that one had distinct grey patch/ stripe behind the dorsal fin.

Kendall Berry called Orca Network at

4:30 pm
to report seeing
orca
spouts mid-
Possession Sound
, they seemed to be heading from Edmonds west toward Kingston.
*
Orca Network received a report from George Rebman just before
3 pm
- they were watching orcas off
Apple Tree Pt
, on the west side across from the Edmonds Ferry dock - whales were spread out over a mile, swimming both north and south, likely foraging. By the end of our conversation he said it appeared they were heading north. There were several large males, and many many whales present!

2:50

orcas

.
