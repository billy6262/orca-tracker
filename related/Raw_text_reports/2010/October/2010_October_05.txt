At
5 PM
I saw
two transient orcas
in
Griffin Bay
from Cattle Point Road on
San Juan Island
. It looked like one male and one female, and they were going on long dives heading north up
San Juan Channel
.

We headed out from Friday Harbor at
noon
today. San Juan Channel was alive with upwellings, tide rips, 100's of birds, Harbor Seals, Harbor Porpoise & Steller Sea Lions. Captain Ivan whisked us down the channel on our way out to see
T20 and T21
, two of our favorite transient orcas. We watched them as they traveled from Hein Bank area across the the Strait of Juan de Fuca headed towards south Lopez. We followed them as they surfaced together; beautiful reflections from the sun on their fins. Just before we left we spotted an Elephant Seal. The transients were close by, but did not seem to notice him.

We were flying from
Anacapa Islands CA
during a helicopter tour. We came upon a group of about
30 Orca's
!!! Wow, they were swimming south in groups of about five, they seems pretty active, swim fast. They did not seem to even pay attention to the helicopter flying over their heads. We do have some professional level video, that a customer took. Stay in touch and I will get you a copy. Thanks,
