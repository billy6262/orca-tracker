Orca Sightings for October 31, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca Network received a call from Chrissy McLean at the Pt Townsend Marince Science Center - a visitor there said he had seen 1 large whale that he believed to be an
orca
from the
Keystone/Pt. Townsend ferry
(must have been around
9 am
). He apparently only saw it 1 time, and no direction of travel was given.
