Orca Sightings for October 20, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We got the word from Sandra Pollard that she saw
orca
blows far to the south at 3 pm from Shore Meadows Drive, just north of Freeland on Whidbey Island. Sandra and I boarded Orca, the 19' outboard on loan from the Center for Whale Research to shoot IDs. Departing Lagoon Point at
3:50, we zig-zagged southwest, then southeast, but saw no whales all the way to Pt. no Pt., then got the message that Mark from DFW had seen them between Pt. no Pt. and Foulweather Bluff, so we did a U turn and covered the same track but closer to mid-strait back north, but still no whales. Way up near the south end of Marrowstone Island we did a scan and I saw one tall male dorsal fin slowly disappear, way back south, halfway to
Double Bluff
. We slowly veered over that way and accompanied J's and their L friends for an hour as they meandered their way north, till

6:15
. There were lively groups and more mundane travelers, some foraging, a few spyhops, lobtails and distant breaches. They continued northward as the sun set over the Olympics. We'll await official IDs from the Center, but I shot photos of about 20 J's and two L's. The highlight was seeing J1 Ruffles and J2 Granny, side by side, away from the other groups, moving steadily northward.

Having spotted blows and breaches from Mutiny Sands (SW Whidbey Island) at
3.00 pm
, I joined Howard in a fast ride south down
Admiralty Inlet
. Howard will put in a much better report than mine, but suffice to say that meeting up with
J's and L's
traveling north off Foulweather Bluff we had a little bit of almost everything on yet another glorious fall day. We could hear the chatter on the hydrophone above the whales exhalations as they passed by with a spy-hop or two, a baby breaching, a Mum nursing and some 'hanky panky' for good measure. We heard high pitched squeaks as a couple of youngsters playing together crossed our bow. It doesn't get much better than being surrounded by whales as the sun sets on Whidbey with a full moon rising above. And an addition to report from 10/19: I'm glad you mentioned the
Harbor porpoise
in your report as I forgot to tell you about those when I was at Shore Meadows on Tuesday. At least three just offshore.

Heather here on the SE corner of
Marrowstone
- Large male and at least 2 others moving quickly north up
admiralty inlet
- directly east of me at

5:35 pm
- male seems to back track once in a while.

We saw about
10 orcas
from my house a bit south of
Bush Point
today, about
5pm
or so, headed northward. Not too much fancy swimming; they seemed to be moving quickly with no fooling around. One was much smaller than all the rest and so likely a baby. Possibly a male or two, but they were pretty far off and so it's tough to be sure. A small boat looked to be following more closely than it should have been but I'm not a good judge of distance.
Anonymous report, Freeland, Whidbey Island

Orca Network received a call at

3:42 pm
from Mark Millard of WA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, reporting
orcas
spread out for nearly two miles, from
Pt. No Point to Foulweather Bluff
- they were so spread out it was difficult to get a good count. They seemed to be traveling more than foraging, and heading NW toward Pt. Townsend. At least three males were observed.
*
Sandra Pollard of Freeland called Orca Network to report a pod of
orcas
off
Mutiny Bay
, SW Whidbey Island at
3 pm
, closer to the other side - first it appeared they were heading north, but later looked like they were milling & foraging. Likely the Js & Ls we saw yesterday.

Same group of 6, same place & time,

3:30-
4:30 PM
, off
Double Bluff
. Instead of heading South into Puget Sound, they continued feeding and slowly drifting toward Mutiny Bay. Watching from Hansville, they were too distant to see markings, even with binoculars. After seeing them 2 days in a row, I'd love to watch every day but will be out of the area until Sunday

3 Humpbacks
today about 6 miles south of
Hein Bank
. They weren't doing much but it was amazing because of stillness of the water and all the porpoises in the area. We ran into some thick fog on the way home but managed to find some Sea Lions. Here is a picture of the Humpbacks and the Sea Lions.
