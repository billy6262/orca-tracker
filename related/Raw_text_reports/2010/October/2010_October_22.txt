Orca Sightings for October 22, 2010
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have been seeing a single individual (identified as a
Minke
by the photo above) for the past week at the mouth of Discovery bay feeding on Salmon. Diagnostic photo attached. Last sighting 10.22.2010. The Minke is moving about the bay quite nicely and does not seem to be in distress from an injury. It makes a circuit from Protection Island to Cape George, Diamond Point and around again. Hopefully we will have some better photos next week.
