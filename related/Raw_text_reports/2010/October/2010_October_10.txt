Entry 2:
2:30 and
3:30 PM I and my neighbors watched a single [minke] swimming east and west in
Hammersley inlet
about 1.5 miles east of Shelton and between Munson and Miller points. The inlet is about 0.25 to 0.5 miles wide here and at the tide showing, about 30 feet deep. The minke surfaced many times at about 5 minute intervals, usually heading in a different direction each time; I did not see any jumping or other play, just rising to spout and then going back down. This went on for about an hour. I saw no white patches. I reported it to Cascadia Research.
Jessie Huggins of Cascadia Research reported that Cascadia finally received a photo of the "mystery whale" that has been reported in numerous locations around south Puget Sound over the past few weeks - from the photo provided, it is believed it is a Minke whale.

Fairly large adult
Minke
was feeding at the mouth of
Oakland Bay (Olympia)
for several hours Sunday
afternoon
. It was larger than the Minke that came in a few years ago and died in Totten Inlet.

A lone
whale
was hunting (I guess) in front of my house (just west of Walker Park) on
Hammersley Inlet
yesterday. I first spotted it about 30 yards off shore around
2 p.m.
It was swimming in a large circle and only surfaced briefly, every once in a while. It was hard to get a good look at it unless I was looking in the right direction when it surfaced. Even then, it was hard to tell if it was an Orca or not. It was black, had a fairly long body, small dorsal fin and could see no white or any other markings on its body. I assume that it was the same whale spotted off of Harstene Island. It was still in the area around
7 p.m
.
