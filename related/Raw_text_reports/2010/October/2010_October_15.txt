============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we watched a medium size
humpback
off
Mandarte Island
and / Sidney,B.C. harbor.
2pm
. Then, for only the second time all season, we were royally treated to the longest bow ride with 6 Dall Porpoise that weaved between the Orcas Express and the Peregrine.

My wife and I were fishing at
Jefferson Head
this morning when about a zillion
orcas
rolled through South to North. There must have been about 60 of them, many female and young whales. They were spread out from West Point to Kingston to Edmonds, all across the Sound, in groups of one, two, three, four, and five. They were in no hurry, and seemed to be playing, with lots of tail slaps, spy hops, and the occasional breach. What a treat for close to two hours to have these beautiful animals visit us.

Sarah McDougal called to report a pod of
orcas
roiling the water in
Admiralty Inlet
and heading NW at

6:05 pm
, closer to Marrowstone Island. There were at least a few dozen orcas.
*
Today from
4 to 6 pm
,
Admiralty Inlet
, north Puget Sound, we observed
J's, K's and some L's
, probably 50 altogether, travel, forage, frolic and socialize their way north. We went out for 3 hours with orcas today in a 19' outboard to get photo IDs, so we were part of a day in the life of those particular orcas. We dropped the hydrophone in to listen to the ecstatic chatter. Unbelievable, but real. They were spread out in small groups for miles, all across 4-6 mile wide Admiralty Inlet. Now and then a breach, or a lobtail, or a cartwheel would raise a big black and white body into the air. Fins bent in all directions. Sometimes two or three whales would be rolling on each other, upside down or sideways. 24-year old K21 Cappucino and his 47-year old sister K40 Raggedy were streaming around each other in some kind of jubilant dance now in its 24th year. The new baby born this past week to L82 poked his pinkish head out beside mom. We could see many blows and fins in the distance, but very few up close. They were that spread out, moving north after a day in Puget Sound.

I ran down to the Edmonds Ferry as soon as I read this, we got nice views closer to the
Kingston
side. Did see a small boat speed right through their area, unfortunately. Other than that, a great group of people on the prow cheered with every dorsal fin.

Orcas
heading lazily north towards

On San Juan island we saw a pod of
4-5 white-sided dolphins
porpoising out of the water in the middle of the Strait. We observed them for about half an hour. Then a sea lion passed by not long afterward. Followed by a few dall's porpoises and harbor seals.
