Orca Sightings for September 21, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fin whale off of Smith Island
. I was out with Puget Sound Express and we spotted the
fin whale, several minke and a humpback
. -Sue Larkin
*
THE
Fin whale
! It was still
west/northwest of Smith
and feeding in the vicinity of
two minkes
. We were watching the minkes as they were fairly active at the surface and all of a sudden the fin surfaced with its huge exhalation! At 85-90 feet long, Fin whales, also known as Finbacks, are the second largest animal on the planet! Second only to the blue whale. These guys were hunted out of the Salish Sea before commercial whaling was banned in 1966. They have not been seen in these inland waters for several years and some say even over a decade. We are hoping this is the first of many yet to come. -Renee Beitzel

Late to report because I discovered this group after the fact. Whale sighting Monday morning around

7:30am j
ust southwest of the tip of
Duwamish Head in West Seattle
. Spotted heading south along shore from my car, couldn't have been more than 75 or 100 from shore! A passing cyclist and I both
guessed minke
based on relatively small size, but based on other reports I wonder if
humpback is more likely
? -Jason Lee Bell

Minke near Smith Island
