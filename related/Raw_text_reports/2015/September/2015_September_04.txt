Haro Strait. L84 Nyssa
, If you look closely you can see the marks on his dorsal from his SAT tag. His travels, combined with Scoter's (K25) tagging showed just how dependent the SRKW's are on Columbia River Salmon. -Connie Bickerton

Cousteau, L-113

At about

7:30 pm
on Friday, Sept 4th my wife and I watched
4 Orca in Saratoga Pass
from our home off North Bluff Rd in
Greenbank
. They were more than a mile offshore so too far for pics but with binoculars we could clearly see 4 whales, 1 larger male and 3 smaller females/juveniles (?). They were very active with numerous breaches, tail slaps, barrel rolls, and even one somersault. We watched for nearly an hour before they moved closer to Baby Island (a seal snack perhaps?) and it got too dark to see. Great fun! -Steve Liedle

Humpback near Flat Top Island,
San Juan Islands, WA at sunset. -James Maya

Washington State Ferries reports
3 gray whales (possibly humpbacks) at Danger Shoals, Haro Strait
.

While searching for THE Fin whale today, we spotted it once and waited for it to resurface. In the meantime, we happened upon a pretty active bird pile/bait ball. A bait ball is a tight ball of fish (herring, capelin, sand-lance) that have come together at the surface due to being driven there by a predator from below. These can be seals, sea lions, porpoise, birds or more likely, minke whales! We found this one surface lunging through the bait ball and a few birds (Ok several) that were taking advantage of the fish that were stunned as they were left in the path of
a feeding minke

I talked to reporting party, Robin Waterman, She is reporting seeing
a whale from her cabin at Quilcene
. She said the animal is large (maybe 30 feet), dark in color with a blowhole. No dorsal fin seen. She didn't notice any blotchiness in the coloration. The animal surfaced near the shore in an area that drops off to deep water fairly quickly. She hopped into a kayak and tried to paddle out to get a closer look but the animal showed what she thinks was a large pec flipper and dove from sight. The sighting occurred around
0915 to 0930
and she hasn't see the animal resurface in the area as of 0945. -Brent Norberg, NOAA
