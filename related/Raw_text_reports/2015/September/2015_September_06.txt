4:09 p.m. -
Seeing
Js from Washington Park
, Anacortes
southbound in Rosario Strait
. Pretty spread. Lots of breaches, spyhops, tail slaps. Over more towards the islands. Pretty far from this side. Lots of active whales not going anywhere in a hurry, leaders
to Bird Rocks by
4:25 p.m
. They may just be tiny specs but it's a nice afternoon. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Definitely
Ts
! They were hunting when we arrived. We shut down and the sea lion took refuge between our hull, later ending up on our hydrofoil. The Ts swam away and the sea lion eventually took off. We were with them for almost an hour because we couldn't move. ...It was crazy!...
heading north in Admiralty Inlet
...there were at least two females, a sprouter, two juveniles and a calf. May have been one more female. Will go back and look at photos tonight. (
Later ID'd by Renee as the T100s
). T100C (left side) with intact satellite tag on his dorsal. He was tagged in
July 2015. -Renee Beitzel

Special day on the water- not only did we see
J pod, a humpback whale, minke whale
, and sea life, but we also got to see the second largest mammal in the world:
the fin whale
! -Heather MacIntyre

Fin whale near McArthur Bank

7:00 p.m. -
Not sure if it was
a gray whale or humpback just outside Gig Harbor
entrance cruising down the Narrows at 7pm then back up past the entrance at
7:45. -Peachy Smalling
*

7:00 p.m. -
This evening a small whale, possibly a grey whale, was
feeding at the mouth of Gig Harbor
. About 20 feet long, was alone. -Jay Smalling
(
Quite probable it's a humpback that has been frequenting the area and was photographed on the 5th, 7th, and 8th-ALB
)
*
We saw it (
humpback
) on the way to
Friday Harbor at
9:45 closer to Lopez island
. Then we saw several in the east end of Speiden channel sometime around
2:30pm, and then as we continued north we saw another humpy in boundary pass, north of Flattop island. We were watching them blow off in front of us and behind us! A few tail flukes too. So huge! -Kimberly Lynn Wickens
*
South end of
Spieden just off Green Point this afternoon, two humpbacks
. -Carrie Selting

11:15 a.m. -
Washington State Ferries reports
a humpback whale
observed by the Samish Ferry off
Turn Rock near Friday Harbor
San Juan Island.
*

2:25 p.m. - Fin or minke about 2.4 miles east of the current station on Smith Island.
Was likely
30-40 feet
, we figured either a juvenile fin or minke... (Confirmed minke by Jonathan Stern: " it is
a minke whale
! very cool..there is no visible blow and in the 4th photo in the sequence that you sent, you can see the bow hole and tip of the dorsal fin at the same time...that is a very minke whale kind of thing....you do not see both on a fin whale" ) -Samuel Hilbert
