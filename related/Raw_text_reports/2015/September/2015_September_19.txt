Orca Sightings for September 19, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Day report: Cool and misty day, with light winds, as we headed out toward
Smith Island and McArthur Bank
to catch up with some
humpbacks
, and they were magnificent! One did a full out-of-the-water breach! We watched two as they moved through the area, feeding on small fish. One was catalog number
MMX0006
, with close to an all black tail fluke, and the other had a lot of white, but I couldn't find a match in the catalog. (see photo below) They eventually joined up and swam quite close to each other, giving us some wonderful views of their flukes and rostrums... -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

We were in a sailboat across from

when we first saw a group of whales. There was a cruise ship on the other side of the whales but maybe it was a later one. The whales were humpbacks and it was awesome. There were at least 2, maybe 3 that we saw several times over 15 or 20 minutes. -Charles O'Hern
