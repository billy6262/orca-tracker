Orca Sightings for September 5, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Resident pods
were heading northeast towards
Fraser River
.
*
My dad Brad Buckmaster took these photos from
Land bank at
3:09pm
. Could this be L-122? There were no boats in the immediate area and the whales were very spread out. This cow and calf pair milled in the same spot about a half mile from shore for at least an hour. I assumed it was L-94 and L-121 but now I'm not so sure because I can't see the finger of L-94's saddle patch and the calf looks quite small to be L-121. Can anyone help with IDs? (Confirmed by the Center for Whale Research to be
new calf L122 with mom L91
). -Justine Buckmaster

K33 Tika
(aka The Shapeshifter) off Lime Kiln this evening. He looks so different from different angles, that I think I've mistaken him for almost every other male in the population at some point during the last two years. -Monika Wieland

K12's K13's and K14's from Boundary

Small group of Orca actively feeding off the dropoff in front of my house. One male, several females, and possibly one young. At least 2 full breaches. To far away for any ID.
