Orca Sightings for September 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:30 p.m. -
We were with
L54s, L88 and L84
as they approached
East Point, Saturna
heading towards
Strait of Georgia
. -Barbara Bender
*
From today's encounter with a small group of
Lpod
. This is
L84
, "Nyssa" traveling off
Turn Point on Stuart Island
. He lost all of his immediate family members, and hangs out with the L54's primarily. -Traci Walter
*
So many whales... Members of all three
Southern Resident pods (J, K and L)
were present in
Rosario Strait
today. Passengers on the Washington State ferry 'Kitsap' enjoyed a rare treat as the orcas meandered along against the backdrop of freshly snow-capped Mt Baker, before passing under the watchful eye of Ken Balcomb (Center for Whale Research). Perfection comes in many forms - we saw it all today. -Sandra Pollard, Naturalist
*

12:19 p.m. -
John Rogstad of WA State Ferries relayed a report from the ferry Kitsap of
45 or more orcas in Thatcher Pass, Rosario Strait
, heading southward.
*
The
T065A's
are a small group of
transient killer whales
. They eat marine mammals, not fish. This group was on a mission! They were chasing prey that was never seen, but later it was evident that they had been successful at making the kill. Lots of surface activity during the hunt, convergence then silence, followed by long dives and a change in direction when all was said and done. We left them at noon
south of Flagler
crossing the channel. Looked like they were heading northeast-ish. Mid channel when we left, heading
closer to Whidbey side.
-Renee Beitzel

10:26 a.m. -
They're very close to shore southbound. They're just a bit
north of Fort Flagler
. -Rachel Haight

5 orcas
spotted by Clipper 4---
2.6 miles north of Point Wilson

around

and then headed SE into the Sound towards Seattle. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
*

4:50 p.m. -
We were with a Humpback at north end of Green Point right
between Spieden and Flattop Islands
going back and forth trending north. -Barbara Bender
*

4:00 pm -
Just found blows. I am on
Vashon
at the ferry and the whale is generally just a bit
north of the Gig Harbor
entrance and just south of Sunrise Beach. Close to Gig Harbor side. No dolphins yet but will keep looking. -Amy Carey

Talked to a few if the fishermen at
Point Defiance
boathouse who have been watching the whale the last couple mornings. Hear it has been going back and forth near gig harbor near shore. -Brian Owen
*

2:00 pm -
Saw the
humpback
again today...it was swimming on the west side of
Vashon Island
then crossed into the center of the channel and headed toward us. It continued down
toward the Narrows
and then turned around to head back north. Would it be feeding on the schools of small fish we've been seeing? (yes) -Amy Bliss-Miller
*

4:00 p.m. -
He's south of the point right now, last seen
headed southeast
into the sound

3:40 p.m. -
He just cruised the shoreline north then south. I think the water was too shallow for him to show his fluke.

3:05 p.m. - Humpback
is here (
Point No Point
) and was close in. The whale was less than 50 feet from shore as it fed, passing first heading west, and then turning and heading east until it got to the end of the point, where it headed southeast into the sound. -Connie Bickerton
