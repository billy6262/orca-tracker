Hello, about
20-30 Orcas passed by our home between Thieves Bay and Mouat Point
on N. Pender. One was a babe - wonderful! Very close to our shore. We have a great fishing hole for the Orcas about 10 metres off our little cove, where the water is really deep - about 200 metres. Super to watch! -Kathy Gilbert
