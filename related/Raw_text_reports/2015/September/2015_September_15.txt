Orca Sightings for September 15, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:35 p.m. - K13s off Eagle
, southbound. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

12:25 p.m. -
residents at Hannah Heights traveling northbound fast. The one and only
J2 Granny - this afternoon off Lime Kiln
. -Monika Wieland
*
Got to spend a calm
afternoon
with members of the
K13 and K16 matrilines
. They were actively fishing along the
west side of San Juan Island
just north of Eagle Cove. -Connie Bickerton
*
Amazing evening with the
T036a's and 075b's in Active Pass, BC
. We headed north after debating whether to go south into rough seas to see Residents, a sure thing, or go north into calm seas on the chance that we might find the Ts. With the help of Lance Underwood on Taku, we found them. Watching them take a seal at the eastern entrance to Active was spectacular. -Capt. Jim Maya

30 minutes off the dock and we come across the
T137s
. As we were traveling along parallel to them, they suddenly turned right toward the boat. I was on the upper deck looking straight down as two orcas surfaced looking up at me. They went under the boat and on the other side, one surfaced on its side RIGHT next to the boat. It was WOW! We left them for a little bit and then found
3 humpbacks
. One of them even breached! On our way back to see the T137s, we came across a Steller sea lion feasting on a skate! It was such fun to watch him whip it around and eat it! We thought the orcas might sneak up on this Steller, but no, they found a different one! We got on scene in time to watch the orcas methodically and successfully hunt a Steller sea lion. We were all waiting for the orcas to send it flying in the air, and sure enough, they did! The entire trip was pretty special, and I'm not sure today's trip will be topped for a long time. There is nothing more incredible than watching transients take down prey! -Rachel Haight

I was witness to something intense and Nat Geo worthy. A family of Bigg's killer whales, the
T137s, took down a large Steller sea lion
. Did you know that Steller sea lions can grow up to 2,400 lbs and have a skull similar to that of a grizzly bear? These are formidable predators in their own right, but are no match for a hungry killer whale. T137 was by far the most acrobatic of the four whales involved, though her youngest, T137D, was definitely very involved and tried her best to help take down the sea lion. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Here are just a few among many action photos from the
T137 pod
attack on a Steller sea lion due
south of Lopez Island
from the Island Explorer 3. T137 did a lot of the hard work in this attack, slashing around, lunging, and trying to keep the sea lion from coming up at times, but the whole family definitely participated. Even little T137D lunged at the sea lion on several occasions! At one point T137 lunged out of the water appearing to plunge the sea lion back under with her left pectoral fin! The biggest, breath taking, moment happened when T137 knocked the sea lion completely out of the water by ramming it with her head! Every once in a while the pod would swim slowly away from the sea lion about 50 yards almost as if they lost interest, and to do some socializing, but they always returned to give their prey more punishment. I've seen a handful of transient attacks on Steller's over the years, and they have always been really intense! This one ranks right up there as one of the best! It was a stunning exhibit of how powerful these animals are. -Bart Rulon

7:30 p.m. -
We spotted
at least two (perhaps 3) humpback whales off of Point No Point
. We saw two dorsal fins and then a blow. It could've been the same whale that had turned. That's why we're not certain of the number. They swam back and forth varying between
200-300 feet off of the Point
. We saw them blow a number of times and diving. Saw their tails more than six times. We watched them for about 30 minutes. They were not orcas because of the short dorsal fin and large size. It was quite exciting! -Maria Stienbeisser
*

6:45 p.m. -
Just received a report from Marilyn Deroy of the
humpback off Point No Point
, Kitsap Peninsula, 600 yards out just hanging around feeding in the area off the point.
*

2:55 p.m. -
Just saw
humpback
tracking north along the
west side of Vashon
. Last sighting of it was down by the Vashon ferry landing. -Amy Bliss-Miller
*
I saw him/her out there around that same time (

10:35 a.m.). Gig Harbor
overlook on the 5 mile drive. -Bryan Owens
*

10:35 a.m. - Humpback
sighted just north of and outside of
Gig Harbor
entrance, traveling south. -Rhonda Turner
*
I was out fishing with my grandpa when we spotted
a humpback whale along Sunrise Beach in Gig Harbor
...It also appeared to be by itself.... I shouldn't say it was entirely alone. It was actually swimming with one or two porpoises (Pacific white-sided dolphins-ALB). It was interesting because for nearly an hour, they swam together. Often, when the whale spouted water, the porpoise would leap out of the water simultaneously or seconds after....-Dieter Veitenhans
