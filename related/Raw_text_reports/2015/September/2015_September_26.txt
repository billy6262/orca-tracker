Orca Sightings for September 26, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
A five-year-old
playing with a Chinook salmon
. We left from
Orcas island
, not totally sure where we were when we saw them, but I want to say it was something like six miles off from Friday Harbor. -Danny Auerbach
*
Smaller of
two humpbacks
spent the better part of the morning breaching while a larger whale foraged close by. Near
Port Madison in Puget Sound
. -Justine Buckmaster
*
L89 Solstice
surfacing west of
Hein Bank
today. The big guy was cruising along slowly, appearing to be in resting pattern and eventually came over next to the boat. He was swimming around while other whales foraged. There were fish there.
L113
caught a salmon right in front of us and looked to be teasing
L121
with it. Solstice is 23 yrs old. -James Gresham
*
L88, Wave Walker
, takes a break from hunting for salmon to breach! We watched him just southwest of
Salmon Bank
on Saturday from the Island Explorer 4. -Bart Rulon
*
On another truly spectacular "mill-pond-like" day, we headed out in search of whales. Little did we know that a
humpback
whale would steal the day as we headed towards
Salmon Bank
to find our Resident orcas. The humpback was very active with hundreds of pectoral fin slaps, and amazing tail lobs, it was difficult to leave! Thankfully we continued on and found
members of L-pod, notably L89 Solstice, his mom L22 Spirit, L77 Matia, L119 Joy
and many others, spread over a large area. After visiting with these majestic whales, on our return trip we found the same humpback, still active. He surfaced one time totally decorated with bull kelp, on the head, body, and his tail. What a sight - and what an amazing day! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

J2 Granny and K14
Lea traveling together in Haro Strait. -Monika Wieland

easterly edge of West Side Preserve

Three humpback whales have been frequenting the mouth of the Columbia River
up as far as the Megler Bridge. Last sighting: 9/26. Our daily paper, Daily Astorian, has a good photo of one. -Kristen Sodervick

Whale sighted swimming north past
Lowman Beach Park, West Seattle
...Looked like a solitary
Humpback whale
. 47deg32'27"N 122deg23'48"W. -Janet Murphy
*
Humpbacks
still hanging around between
Edmonds, So. Whidbey Island and Point No Point, WA
- Marilyn DeRoy called at

6:15 pm
with an update on the Point No Point humpback, saying it was about 500 yards out off the north side of Point No Point, milling and diving around the area.
*

6:18 p.m. -
from my location half a mile inland, the
humpbacks are in line with Double Bluff
, but from the ferry terminal, it will probably be more inline with Scatchet Head. There are 2 here,
closer to Edmonds than Whidbey Island
. The third one that I see near PNP is very far away (the farthest I've ever seen a humpback from my home) and is much closer to PNP than Whidbey Island.

6:00 p.m.
- Make that
three humpbacks, one by PNP and two nearer to Edmonds
, maybe 2-3 miles NNW of the ferry terminal. And the one near PNP is more like a mile off PNP, judging by its distance vs. a tug on MarineTraffic.

5:20 p.m. -
I am seeing
two humpbacks
in the north sound. The first is
halfway between Edmonds and Double Bluff.
The second is way
far away from Edmonds near Point No Point (PNP)
. It is hard for me to accurately pinpoint its location relative to PNP, but I think it is about 2 miles north of PNP. -Sherman Page
*

5:00 p.m. -
There was a
humpback near Spieden Channel
, south of FlatTop near Rueben Tarte. Saw the flukes from shore! -Peggy Mauro
*

5:00 p.m. -
I saw at least one, maybe
two humpbacks between Vashon Island and West Seattle
, near Fauntleroy ferry...on the move, heading south! -Anna Sewell
*

4:50 pm -
WA State Ferries reports a large whale,
probably a humpback, off the Fauntleroy dock
in West Seattle.
*
Around

4:00 p.m. - Saw 2 humpbacks
while kayaking near
Port Madison on Bainbridge Island
. -Kim Dougan
*
A
humpback diving south of Lopez Island
today. One of
3 we saw between San Juan Island and Rosario Strait
. -James Gresham

2:00 p.m. -
On another truly spectacular "mill-pond-like" day, we headed out in search of whales. Little did we know that a
humpback
whale would steal the day as we headed
towards Salmon Bank
to find our Resident orcas. The humpback was very active with hundreds of pectoral fin slaps, and amazing tail lobs, it was difficult to leave! ...on our return trip we found the same humpback, still active.

*

1:45 p.m. - Large humpback
heading north in shipping lanes just east of
Port Madison
, traveling north fairly rapidly. A boat came speeding by only 30 or so yards from the whale, then he disappeared. I don't think the boater saw him. -Shelly Edwards
*
Noon - Humpback whale heading towards Skunk Bay
. -Stu Davidson
*

11:00 a.m. to NOON - Two humpbacks
(large & small) spotted off
Jefferson Beach, Kitsap County
, on Puget Sound. Nine of us saw the pair. We all perceived them to be a mother/"baby" pair. I believe this was just based on how small the second appeared (we never saw much of the young one's body). Juvenile might be a better word. Also, the extreme closeness of the pair, the little one was alongside like a shadow. I did not see the tale of the little one. -Donna Moreland
*

8:20 a.m. -
There was a
whale
sighting on the
7:55 run of the
Bainbridge - Seattle ferry
this morning. Pretty sure it was a humpback and it did a full breach right off the port side. It was pretty spectacular. -Sarah Martin
*
I live on
Lopez Island
and I counted ten spouts as
two moved south through San Juan Channel
, off of Otis Perkins Park. I was in the car and did not have binoculars, so I could not identify whether there were two and if they were orcas or...? Any other ID's in the channel? -Diana Sheridan
