Orca Sightings for February 17, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
On Sunday weather cooperated for small boat operations and despite whales again being extremely spread out in the
northern St. of Georgia
, we were finally able to get a look the newest calf
J51 and mother J19
. We also documented that as of
1600 the tag on J27 had detached
, despite having gotten an Argos location as recently as 1200, so this was a fascinating opportunity to see progression tag detachment over the last couple of days. I will send a final map soon. Because there had been a sighting of Ks and Ls off Sooke on Sat. afternoon we headed down to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and were very fortunate to intercept Ks and Ls about 1600 yesterday (2/16) at the west entrance - we managed to stay with them sporadically through the night tracking acoustically. We were able to do small boat ops today and
deploy a tag on L84
. We had great weather conditions all afternoon and were able to collect 3 scale samples and two biopsy samples - however, no one seems to be pooping. We are continuing south with Ks and Ls - we are about half way between LaPush and Westport. -Candace Emmons, NOAA NWFSC.
