Orca Sightings for February 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Very awesome encounter with a very
large group of Killer Whales
. There were
21 animals in total
, mostly of females and calves, but a couple male sprouters as well. Several different pods that came together. They took down at least a Harbor Seal and a Harbor Porpoise, may have been more. IDs:
T86As, T100s, T124s, T124As

After hearing about the whales near Lopez Island from the Washington State Ferry report, several of us heading out on the Western Explorer to look for them. We intercepted them in
San Juan Channel right outside of Friday Harbor around 12
. They were
spread out in 3-4 groups heading north
. From oil slicks in the water it was clear they made several kills. When all the groups converged near Jones Island, there was a lot of surface activity and they killed at least one harbor porpoise. Dave Ellifrit identified the whales present as the
T100s, T886As, T124s, and T124As.
We left them at about

1:30
.
I went straight over to Snug Harbor where I jumped on my boat with a few friends. After getting an update from Jim Maya, we found the whales again
northwest of Battleship Island heading north at about
2:45
. The
T100s
were several miles further north, with all the others in one large traveling group. We left them on the
Canadian side of Haro aiming for Moresby at about
3:30
. -Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

A big
transient spyhop
with gulls circling overhead, from yesterday in
San Juan Channel
. The whales made at least four kills while we were there (harbor seals and harbor porpoise), and the gulls were not shy about getting their share! -Monika Wieland

Thanks to Ivan Reiff of Western Prince Adventures for passing on a sighting of killer whales near Friday Harbour mid day. We were able to catch up with the
T100's, T086A's and the T124's near Moresby Island late afternoon
. -Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

5:35 -
Dave Ellifrit called after traveling with
21 transients, 6 T100's, 3 T86A's, and 12 T124's
. The encounter began about

1:30 in Upright Channel
(between Shaw and Lopez islands), up San Juan Channel, out Spieden Channel, across Haro Strait and north to
Moresby Island by 5 pm
. In Haro Strait the group split into two groups: the T100s, now up to six members with a new calf, in one group that continued heading west, and the T124s and T86As, 15 in all, who were heading north to Moresby Island when the encounter ended.

A Big ole'
transient superpod!
Roughly 17 Killer Whales (turned out to be
21
), doing what they do.. Killing things! At least one harbor seal and at least one Harbor Porpoise. Today started with the Washington State Ferry reporting
10 orcas by Thatcher Pass
west bound from the ferry. I alerted a friend, on the off chance we would get to go out and see them. We waited and got another update that they were still coming toward San Juan Island. So, away we go! Turns out there were many groups of Transient Killer Whales. They were
spread in 3 groups across San Juan Channel
and then eventually started zig zagging with many of the group coming together and killing a Harbor Porpoise near Jones Island. They also made a few other kills in the channel as well as oil slicks were seen and the gulls had a bounty. -Traci Walter

Synchronized swimming, orca style. I had an amazing afternoon with a group of nearly 20
(21) transient orcas
! There will be many photos to share from this encounter, but for starter's here's one from San Juan Channel. -Monika Wieland, Orca Watcher Photography

Maia called again to report orcas in
San Juan Channel near Cape George
.

Maia called again with a report from the ferry Yakima of 8-10 orcas still heading west in
Upright Channel, between Shaw and Lopez islands
.
10 am -
Maia of WA State Ferries called with a report of about ten orcas heading west, just west of Thatcher Pass, on the west side of Rosario Strait, on the Anacortes to Friday Harbor ferry route.
*
We flew yesterday and saw a minimum of
8-10 orcas offshore of Copalis Rocks (SW Washington coast)
about 1 miles at Latitude 47.14653 N. and Longitude 124.24760. Scattered so there may have been more. Two large bulls with female in one group being quite active on the surface. Others scattered around a crab boat. -Steven Jeffries, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife

5:20pm - The Humpback Whale
passing our place again heading south - an awesome sight! 5th time spotting one (could be the same?) over the last week. From Edmonds, a mile north of the
Edmonds ferry terminal
, looking out over the Puget - with the Kitsap Peninsula in the background (view of a couple miles north of Kingston). -Stu Davidson Photography

Hood Canal Humpback
still here! I saw it this morning at about

9:15
passing by
Maple Beach in Seabeck
heading south. Traveling slowly a few breaths, long dive, then gone. Neighbor also saw it
Friday Feb. 6th.
No more details. Heard this second hand from another neighbor. Was hoping it had heading out of the canal but looks like that is not the case. -Kathy Cole
