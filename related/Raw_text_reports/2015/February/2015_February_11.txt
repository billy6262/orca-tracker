Orca Sightings for February 11, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
11 February update - On the evening of
February 8, J pod was near the
west entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. They continued to spend the day in the same general vicinity but by the 10th they had moved back
out near the continental shelf break
before they looped back to the north around
La Perouse Bank
. By the morning of the 11th they were headed back toward the west entrance of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Dr. Brad Hanson and a team of scientists embarked on a 21-day research cruise out of Newport, OR aboard the NOAA Ship Bell M. Shimada, with the hopes of catching up with J27. -NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center

We found the
