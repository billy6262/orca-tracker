. Did not see a dorsal fin between the spray and tail. Headed north, only surfaced once that I saw. -Dana Brooks

One Humpback whale
traveling south,
West side of Whidbey between Lagoon and Bush Points at 1 PM
, breaching. It surfaced, rolling a bit, and so what I saw was its underside, and the distinctive furrows (don't know what they're called). It was very close to shore, not much more than a hundred feet. -Deborah Heg

11:15 AM -
We sighted
approximately 7 whales together at Secret Cove on the Sunshine Coast
(east side of Strait of Georgia). One baby stayed close to it's mother, two older whales and maybe some adolescents in there! They were very happy, going under our boat (a fish boat with the motor off, prop. not moving!!) They stayed near us playing!!! for about 45 minutes playing and "huffing" loudly! Very exhilirating! -Alexia Norman-Alarie
Note: ID's were not determined for this sighting

2 February update - Based on the trajectory of travel on the afternoon of the 29th J pod was expected to show up in Puget Sound on Friday the 30th. Although they never arrived (but K pod did), by that evening when J27s tag turned back on we observed that they had returned to the western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. They spent the next day again meandering around the western end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Last night (1 February) and this morning's locations continue to show the whales remaining that same general area. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging
