Orca Sightings for February 13, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod was at the north end of Texada Island
. They spent the 14th moving around in the
northern Strait of Georgia
. That evening they headed down
Malaspina Strait
and then headed north between
Texada Island and Vancouver Island
on the morning of the 15th. The last Argos location we received was at 1100 that morning and we later saw J27 without the tag, completing over 6 weeks of movement monitoring of J pod in the winter. This beats the average duration of tag attachment (30 days). Map courtesy of Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

Jeanne Hyde and I had a twenty minute encounter near sunset with the
T60's and T2B
. Jeanne had heard them on the
hydrophones late afternoon
and Tom and Jane Cogan eventually found them heading north near
D'Arcy Island
(west side of Haro Strait opposite San Juan Island) while scanning from their porch and kept them in sight until we could get on them near Halibut Island. We left the whales heading west on the north side of Mandarte Island at about 1730. -Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
