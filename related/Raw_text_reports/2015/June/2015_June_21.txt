5:00 pm -
Just observed
30+ orca moving up from Lighthouse Point Roberts
to west to get around
Tsawassen Ferry Terminal
. Many were close to shore, some breaching and front grouping included a calf. Great sight. -John Gates

2:30 pm -
About
7 or 8
have just headed south again at a leisurely pace. (
West side of San Juan
)

2:18 pm -
I have been watching from the shore just south of
Lime Kiln
and have seen several "passes" The first was
J pod
(reliably identified!) and there seemed to be a lot of whales. Since then they have passed in smaller groups heading in both directions. (probably just some Js and Ks). -Linda Horton

12:26 PM -
WA State Ferries,
6 orcas northbound near South Cod Reef
(north Haro Strait).
*
We got on scene with the
Residents just north of Lime Kiln State Park just after
11:30am heading northbound
. Film (video link below) begins with K35 surfacing and J34 just after him out from County Park. There's a nice sequence with the Center for Whale Research in the background midway through. We continued northbound with them left as they were approaching the
entrance to Mitchell Bay about
12:30pm
. Also ID'd were the
J17s, J22s, J19s, J11s, L87 and possibly the J14s
who L87 was traveling with earlier. Possibly more K too since members of all three pods were around San Juan Island earlier in the morning and shuffled up then down the island. Alisa Lemire Brooks

Js and Ks traveling northbound
in Haro Strait. -Janine Harles

...After spending the night off the south end of the island, I heard them on the
Lime Kiln hydrophones at
7:30 AM
. When we got on the water, we encountered our first whales -
L82 and L116
- heading south just north of
Pile Point at
8:45
. Shortly thereafter all the whales turned north again and we followed the lead group
(J2s/J14s, J19s, K12s, K13s, K14s, L4s, L47s, and L95)
all the way up Haro Strait to Spieden Channel where we left them at
11:30. They were active and very vocal the whole way. This group continued north, while I heard that
J-Pod Group B along with the K16s and K21 went back south
. The J16s went rogue and I heard from a friend they were milling off Spieden Channel well after all the others had gone north/south respectively. -Monika Wieland
