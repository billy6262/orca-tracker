Orca Sightings for June 22, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:00 pm -
We caught up with
K's and L's at Limekiln
last night at about 5pm as we were sailing northbound is a stiff southerly breeze. The whales were in tight to shore traveling at less than 5 knots before they stopped for
a rest and some play south of Henry Island
. We left them
before 7pm
as they took off
north around Kellet Bluff
. What a great place to live and play! -Keith Provan

J pod (group A), K pod, L4s and L95:
video (below) of the whales passing
Lime Kiln
on Monday. I set the vidoa camera down for the first part and just let it record, thus the crooked horizon. Jeanne (Hyde) reminded me that it's just another way to show that the whales are going "up island" (Also please excuse the mad dash down the rocks part way through, I just had to get a bit closer!) -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Man, I just can't get enough of the
J16's
. The orcas made a big circle out on the banks then headed straight
back for San Juan Island
, trending north up the island. And who did we find at the north end of San Juan? None other than the group that headed north last night that had already come back down south. They must have heard each other in the large acoustical corridor and wanted to join up (which I saw on my evening trip)! It was a blustery day out there, but it was nice to see the orcas socializing. Finger's crossed for higher levels of Chinook moving through these waters! -Heather MacIntyre

Hey Orca Network! We just left a group of about
5 transient orcas just north of Point No Point (Kitsap) at
6:14 pm
. One group of 3 was close to shore on the Kitsap side, and a mother and calf were mid channel...They were
heading south

1:00 pm -
I witnessed
orcas drowning a grey whale around 1pm
on 6/22/2015. This took place near
Westport
, around Twin Harbors State Park. I was surf fishing and observed this happening for 10 minutes. They were about 200 yards offshore. I took crude photos and a video with my cell phone. Not sure if they were successful. I think I spotted an orca calf. I also saw two large air releases. Everything ended as quickly as it started. -William Burlison
