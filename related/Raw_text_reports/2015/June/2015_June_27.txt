Orca Sightings for June 27, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
This evening from

5:45 -
6:45 PM
I watched as
Js and Ks went south past Lime Kiln
. Present were the K13s, K14s, K12s, J19s, and J16s in that order, with the J2s/J14s offshore towards the end. -Monika Wieland

Big spyhop from
K33 Tika this evening off Lime Kiln Lighthouse State Park
, San Juan Island. -Monika Wieland
*

6:30 pm -
While on the road along the
west side of San Juan Island at the West Side Preserve we saw orcas
out a half mile or so moving generally southeast. Upon disembarking the car and scrambling down the hill I applied binocs to eyes and was able to tentatively ID
J16 and her baby J50
, which made sense since they had been seen earlier that day a few miles north. Other orcas were seen fanned out across Haro Strait in various modes of traveling and splashing. -Howard/ON
*

5:43 pm - I hear them now! Lime Kiln
. -Susan Wickland

6:05 pm - Loud echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone
.

5:25 pm - echolocation and calls, sounds like some Ks on OS

5:15 pm - start hearing SRKWs on OrcaSound hydrophone
. -Alisa LB/ON

Maia of WA State Ferries reported
6 orcas headed south in Haro Strait
near Mandarte Island.

11:00 am -
...What a sight to see! I was on tour with Sooke Coastal Explorations.
All of J pod & some L pod
. Heading West! Spanned out from Vancouver Island and
across the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. -Deanna Brett
*
At
8 AM
this morning we picked up the
K12s and K13s
heading north just north of
Pile Point
. (While it sounded like more whales than this were headed "in" last night, I believe the others were westbound out the strait again.) Over the next 2+ hours we followed them slowly north, leaving them at
Kellett Bluff still going north at
10:45 AM
. For the most part they were spread out and in slow travel mode, with occasional stops to forage. -Monika Wieland

WARNING:
June 27th PREDATION EVENT PHOTOS (and ID NOTES)
The next part of this section includes many photos submitted by several people of a female carrying around a Harbor seal she had killed. It is not bloody but we understand is upsetting to some people and out of respect wanted to give notice.
There was some confusion circulated about IDs and which pods/individuals were present, here are ID notes by Melisa Pinnow (Naturalist and volunteer with Center for Whale Research): "
T077A
is a loner male and hangs out with other matrilines instead of his family. I think people assumed it was the T077s because of T077A but really it was the
T075Bs and T036As
. That spy hop there with the freckles on her chin is
T036A
. The female with the seal in her mouth that has the eye patch with freckle like dots at the left end side is
T075C
, who is not the mom of anybody."

7:20 pm -
One orca
being followed by boats on
north side of Lopez island
, across from Orcas island. Does anyone know which one it is? -Forest Chick
*

5:15-
5:30pm - Between Shaw and Orcas Islands
. I saw her (
T75C
ID by Melisa Pinnow) come up four different times w/this seal. Lots of spy hops, tail lobs... -Cathy Miller Scott,

Entry 2:
*
We had a very memorable encounter with transient orcas near Shaw Island in the afternoon on the Island Explorer 3.
T75B, T75C
, and two family calves chased and caught a harbor seal while
T77A
swam about a quarter mile away. The orcas played with the seal by throwing it around like a rag doll at times and spyhopping with it in their mouths over and over again. It was an experience we will never forget! -Bart Rulon
*
...An incredible whale-watching excursion (w/Outer Island Expeditions) I went on in the San Juan Islands of Washington state! ...We watched and gently followed this
pod of transient Orca whales between Lopez and Orcas Islands
in the San Juan islands...there were
about seven whales
, plus a very large male (
T77A
) in the distance...The portion of the pod we were following were the adult females with their calves...We saw them play with each other: tail slaps, jumps, spy hoping, belly rolls, back flips, so incredible! As a nature photographer its very rare to witness wildlife acting like this, and I will never forget what an incredible experience we all had on the water on this day! -Jim Stiles
*
T75C
with a harbor seal she had just killed near
Lopez Island ferry terminal
. Members of the
T36As and T75Bs
were cruising inshore along
Blakely Island
in a beautiful, peaceful prelude to an incredibly intense predation event we were to witness a few minutes later. -James Gresham

T075B with her calf T075B2
, born in April of 2015. -Melisa Pinnow, Naturalist

We had
at least 5 humpbacks in the waters north and east of Race Rocks
, (MMY0006 'Windy' (left) and BCX1068 'Split Fluke' (right) swim in tandem past Race Rocks) and then
Big Mama out by Beecher Bay
