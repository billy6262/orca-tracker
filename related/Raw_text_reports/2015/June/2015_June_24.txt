Orca Sightings for June 24, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were the only two boats with the
J14s and J16s through Active Pass
yesterday, and as usual, they really ramped up the action in there. It seemed the babies needed some help through some of the currents, but the orcas all went nuts playing around in and surfing the wake of ferries and yachts, rolling, breaching, propoising - just having a great time. -Andy Scheffler

8:00pm - 5 or 6 orca
. Spotted the first orca as it breached less than 50 meters away from 10 mile point. Then watched as the remainder of them breached further off shore as the traveled towards
Discovery island
. -Ryan Key

L110
with his old lip injury. His lip folds back and exposes his teeth a little. -Capt. James Maya, (ID description by Melisa Pinnow)

I spent the day on San Juan Island and had some fabulous orca sightings. After arriving at
Lime Kiln in early afternoon
, several
Southern Residents
traveled by between approximately
2 and 3PM
and were spread out. The last group that I saw was the
K-7s (K13s)
with the fabulous
K-44 Ripple
(one of my personal favorites). Many people enjoyed the passing from the rocks and also several kayakers watched from the near shore kelp beds. Later in the day I went out with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching and we encountered the
L-4s, L-47s and L-95
. They were in a resting line
heading north on the west side of SJI
. When they got to the north end, one of the lead whales spyhopped at which time all in the group promptly did an about face. They stayed nearly stationary for a very long time doing dozens of spy hops, rolling, tail slapping, and playing in the kelp. The spy hops were a little unusual in that the whales were staying above the water for very long looks. They eventually broke up into two groups moving back south down Haro Strait. One group stayed closer to SJI and the other group west in Canada. Several made their way down to Kelp Reef and did more spy hops and tail slaps. We watched this behavior under beautiful skies and soft light while a great blue heron contemplated his evening meal perched on a kelp bed. The waters were calm and the air was still with backlit blows hanging in the air like a spider web on a dewy morning. Both groups joined back up and gave indications they were possibly headed back out to open sea. It was a magical day. -Debbie Stewart
