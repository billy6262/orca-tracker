Orca Sightings for June 20, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Observed
a very large pod (25 plus)of orca whales between
12:30 and
1:00 p.m. today,
June 20th at Point - No - Point on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
They were headed south. There were too many to count. It looked to us as if there were a few young ones because of the small fins swimming along side much bigger whales. Watched through binoculars. Not sure if they were transients or residents? They were moving quickly. Not feeding. There were many sizes of whales. No photos, sorry. -Patricia Johnston, Victoria BC

In the evening
J-Pod, K-Pod, and the L4s, L47s, and L95
made their way in to Haro Strait. -Monika Wieland

3:00pm -
I got to spend some time with
Jpod as they came past Sooke
! -Deanna Brett,
*
I was on the
west side of San Juan Island
looking for the incoming resident orcas when I spotted some blows on the west side of Haro Strait near Discovery Island. With no sign of the residents yet, I hopped in the boat with some friends and we headed out to investigate. We met up with the
T125s, T46Cs, T127, and T49C just north of Kelp Reef at
7:15 PM
. They were clearly in travel mode, moving quickly as we followed them around the west side of D'Arcy Island. When we left them at
7:45 they were heading north between James and Sidney Islands. -Monika Wieland
*
On Saturday passengers about the Legacy got spoiled on our evening trip because on our way to see the inbound Resident orcas we actually ended up finding some of the most iconic exotic orcas that have been documented here- the
T125's
!! As soon as I saw
T127
I knew exactly who those whales were can't mistake him! They were traveling with the
T046C's
, who I've also never seen before. We followed the T125's and T046C's north up
Haro Strait
, and if you can believe it, actually found
T049C
milling on his own as well. Not surprisingly, he continued to travel on his own as the larger group of Transients went north. -Heather MacIntyre
*

8:30 pm - from Ebey's Landing, 8-10 orcas
seen feeding and traveling. -Bob Kruger
*

7:41 pm -
We estimate there were
10-12 Orcas swimming by Fort Casey
on Whidbey Island. We believe there were two extremely small individuals in this pod as well as at least one enormous individual. We know for a fact that there was at least one very small whale, but again, we think there were two. The large whale breached clear of the water on at least two occasions and there was also tail slapping and head bobbing behavior. We believe a cruise ship altered it's north bound course to better view these whales. The whales were close to shore and headed north. Lots of other people saw them. -Robert Gray

Went out with Puget Sound Express, found the
