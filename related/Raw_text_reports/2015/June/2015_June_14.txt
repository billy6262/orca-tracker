Orca Sightings for June 14, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Another beautiful day. Orca reports indicated all long distance trips, our closest option being to Whidbey Island and Admiralty Inlet. There we found
4 Transients, T127
with a very distinguished dorsal fin, and he travels with
T125, T125A and T128
. They were slowly heading north - we found them
just north of Lagoon Point
. A super day with lots of amazing views of these beautiful mammals as they appeared to be foraging, with lots of tail slaps. It was a long trip, but so well worth it. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
*

10:10pm - hearing faint J and possibly K calls
. Been hearing intermittent calls the past hour. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*
In the
evening
we headed out to look for
Js and Ks
, and found the leaders (the
K13s and K22s
) rocketing southbound from
Henry Island at
6:30 PM
. We continued north as they continued south, and we encountered most of the rest of
Js and Ks just south of Stuart Island.
We followed them as they made their way to
Lime Kiln at about
8:30 PM
. As we headed home, we encountered what may have been the trailers (at least the J16s) off the north end of San Juan Island at
8:45 PM. -Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

10:27pm - Squeals
are back on
Lime Kiln

Today was awesome! I saw a Harbor seal munching on a very large octopus and one bald eagle knocked another into the water! Luckily the other eagle was able to get airborne again, but 2 things I've never seen on the water here! Here's one image from today! We saw
Js, Ks, and one of our passengers spotted some transient Killer whales
on the way home! -Traci Walter
*
Headed west and encountered
L12s, L85, and L25
. Whales were very spread out heading west, and we spent time with the trailers. -Connie Bickerton

T125A and T128 were the two adult males in Admiralty Inlet
. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

6:00pm -
quick stop at
Lagoon Point
on way to ferry. Spotted their dorsals and blows Kitsap side mid channel just going in circles...sightline northside Lagoon Pt and south end Fort Flagler. Was

5:00
before Ed finally saw them again...still out from Lagoon, Kitsap side of mid channel. And now we must leave. Beautiful day on bluffs above Admiralty.

2:50 pm -
Ed and I came to Fort Casey for much needed day out...
orcas are just hanging out north of Lagoon Point
probably fighting the tide says Naturalist Jill Hein aboard Mystic Sea confirms T125s. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

10:45 - Two adult male Transients
heading north in Admiralty Inlet just
south of Bush Point
, on the Whidbey island side, in the northbound traffic lane. -Howard Garrett
*

10:26 - Small group of transients in Admiralty Inlet
, trending north south of Bush Point. -Renee Beitzel
*
I saw them at

10:20 am in Mutiny Bay
, south of Bush Point and Lagoon Point,
heading north
at a fast lick with no sign of stalling. The tide was then on the turn. -Sandy Pollard
*
We saw the
T124A's
today. The whales were pushing straight into a vicious flood tide
off Eastpoint where Boundary Pass meets the Strait of Georgia
. At one point the whales turned directly into several whale watching boats requiring a quick stop to give them room. -James Gresham
*
First
Humpback about 30 min out of Port Angeles
.
Found Big Mama on our way home, about an hour west of Port Angeles. -Connie Bickerton
