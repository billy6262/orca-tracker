Orca Sightings for June 15, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Blissful day aboard the M/V Sea Lion with
J (J16s & J19s) and K pods along the west side of San Juan in the afternoon
and just north of
East Point in the evening
. -Sarah McCullagh
*
This morning
Js and Ks headed east from Victoria towards San Juan Island
. At

12:30 PM they approached Lime Kiln
from the south, heading north. The
J16s
were in the lead, followed by the
K14s, J19s, then J2s
. They stalled out at this point, seemingly waiting for the others the catch up - and around

1:30 they were joined by the K12s
. Others (presumably the rest of them) were offshore, and by
2 PM they had all turned south again
. -Monika Wieland

Today was the first day Whale Scout and SSAMN (Salish Sea Assoc. of Marine Naturalists) had volunteers out at the
Westside Preserve (San Juan Island)
...The goal of this new program is to provide land-based whale watching experiences leading to stewardship of the marine environment.
J and K pod hung around the entire afternoon
... -Whitney Neugebauer
*
Another hot, sunny day here in the islands and I spent it relaxing on the west side of San Juan Island. While I soaked up some rays, I soaked up some orcas in the process as
J and K pods wandered up and down the coast with the tide
. -Katie Jones
*
Many, many
orcas off Lime Kiln today around
2:00 this afternoon
, some just right off the kelp beds. -Shelly Turne Greybeck
*
An amazing day with a very social family group,
T65As
(Close up on T65A2's dorsal wounds.) When I watched them on Friday (6/12) they were quietly traveling through Agate Pass (Kitsap County). Today in the wind and waves they were incredibly playful. Approx. mid channel S
trait of Juan de Fuca between Port Angeles, WA and Victoria, BC
. -Connie Bickerton
*
T065A, 065A4, and 065A5
headed south west in the
Juan de Fuca Strait
. -Mark Malleson
*

4:00 pm -
today halfway
between Secret Cove and Pender Harbour
about 2 miles offshore, a single large Orca heading south at a leisurely pace, breaching about once per minute. -Ralph Gorby
*

1:45 pm -
from
Steilacoom ferry
at least 3 mid channel slowly moving south on east side of Anderson Island.

1:00 pm -
watched
3 or 4 from Titlow
traveling south, hugging
Gig Harbor/Fox Island side
. At least 3 orca pass by around
1:00. Now just out of sight behind Day Island.

12:46 pm - Southbound south of Narrows bridge close to Gig Harbor side.
-Jill Clogston
*

1:00 pm - T127 passed Fox Island
Fishing Pier steaming hard south...
4-6 of them
. -Glenn Hansen
*

12:20 pm -
Out from
Salmon Beach
and rapidly moving south toward the Narrows.
*

12:11 pm -3 to 4 Orcas off of south Vashon
, between Gig Harbor and tip of Point Defiance. -Michele Riley Campbell
*

10:45 pm -
Brian Owens called to say
a male orca and a couple of others were about 300 yards off Owens Beach
heading toward the Tacoma Narrows bridge.
*

9:30 am - Orcas in Port Angeles Harbor
. I have photos of
at least 5 dorsal fins
visible at one time. The group seemed to consist of several very small whales and one much larger than the rest. I only saw markings which indicated they were Orcas on the largest of the pod. The whales would only breach occasionally and did not appear to be moving quickly or hunting. They did not seem to be playing. I did see seal shortly before and after the sighting so I doubt they were feeding. -Carlton Chastain
*

8:00 am - Lone orca hunting off Cadboro Bay/Jemmy Jones (off Victoria)
for 40 minutes. Judging by grey saddle patch, might have been T012A (unconfirmed). Left for Haro Strait afterwards. -Glenn Barker
*

7:05 am -
Today I saw a male
T127
and female Orca feeding at Three tree Point near the Des Moines Marina. -Peter Madonna
*

5:55 am - 1 Male orca traveling south off Fauntleroy (West Seattle) ferry terminal terminal
. Distinct notch or bend on tip of dorsal fin. -Burt Miller
*

5:50 am - Lone male orca,
with hooked dorsal fin, on 0
550 Fauntleroy ferry from Vashon
. -Kevin Silis
*

9:45am -
saw a pod off shore while walking in the Chinese Graveyard (Victoria). About
8 dorsal fins
in total (maybe more). They were pretty far out towards Trial Island. At least 2 whale watching boats stopped. It looked like they were circling and feeding.
