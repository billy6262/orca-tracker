============================================================

Entry 1:
I was lucky enough to see what I think were three different pods, here is one of them. Off of
Pickering Rd
. by the bridge in Pickering Passage. -Maria Nelson

We spotted
a pod of at least 8 orcas in Puget Sound
around Harstine Island just under the bridge, they were traveling south to Steamboat Island, then turned around and headed back towards the bridge at about 3pm. There were several boats escorting them but keeping their distance. -Jeri Sevier

1:30 PM - Orca Sighting in Pickering Passage
. Saw a pod of
at least 5 but probably 6 Orcas in Pickering Passage
between Harstine Island Bridge and Northern Tip of Squaxin Island this past Saturday. Calmly traveling South intially just to double back 20 minutes later. They were trailed by quite a bunch of boats. -Carsten Eisenbarth
