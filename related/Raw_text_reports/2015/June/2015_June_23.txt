Orca Sightings for June 23, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Se-Yi-Chn (J45) with the Whidbey NAS
in the background. They were doing some serious foraging and salmon chasing when we were on scene. I hope they got a belly full! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Some encounters are so very special, and get ingrained in your memories that even if you pass a certain location over and over again, those memories come back. I think whenever I see the Whidbey island bluffs, I will see this little girl playing and breaching on a sunny calm day. What a treat. This is lovely little girl
J50, Mom is Slick J16
. I particularly think this female calf holds so much hope. We need more females to continue breeding to help bolster the population. So when I see her, I can't help but he hopeful she will help bring a brighter future for the Southern Resident Killer whales. -Traci Walter

We just saw
a couple orcas at Cliffside campground on NAS Whidbey
. They were quite a ways out so we couldn't get any kind of a decent pic, but that might have been the most exciting thing ever! (turned out to be members of J pod). -Janna Harmon
*

2:30 pm - From Biz Point (Rosario Strait, Anacortes)
Maybe
6-7 orca including 2 large males and a few smaller ones
, with one much smaller than the rest. Guess is they were feeding because of lots of fast circling and "darting" while leisurely heading south. Only about 300 yards from shore. No boats around them! Seagulls where gathering on the water where they were. -Cheryl Buchanan
*
Nigel (L95)
exhaling little diamonds in the air! .He was heading south on the
west side of San Juan Island
off shore from
Nugget (L55)
and her crew. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

12:30pm -
1:45pm -
We were at the roadside lookout approximately
1km south of Lime Kiln
.
Approx 15 orcas
approached from the south spread out in a long line. Probably 30 minutes from the first to the last orca to pass by our view point. Then they eventually turned around (I think near Lime Kiln) and returned south again. All within a 1 1/2 hour span. -Randall Collins
*

10:30 am - 6 Orca
sighted off my back deck. I just moved to the
NE side of Orcas Island
and I don't know the name of the two little islands to the NE of us between us and the mainland but they are in between Orcas Island and those 2 islands. (good chance this was
J pod
who was in Rosario hours later, see above reports/photos-ALB). -Stephen Hohman Transient/Bigg's orcas
*

3:12 pm -
leaving with them in general area at the south end
Useless Bay
still northbound, researchers still on scene.

2:45 pm -
from
Point No Point
: they have moved even further out and are heading towards Admiralty but aiming towards Whidbey. They've crossed past mid channel yellow buoy that is
between Pt No Pt and Maxwelton/Useless Bay
.

2:00 pm -
from Eglon boat launch/beach I can see they are still a bit south porpoising along northbound at a good clip. They have moved out from shore and are now approx one mile out. Some surface activity. Research skiff with them since Kingston.

1:05 pm -
just pulled in to Kingston on the ferry. The pod is
north of the ferry off Apple Cove Point/Kingston
. Nice group of folks young and old who had not seen orcas before. Moved up to bluff and watched until they rounded the point out of my sight. They appeared to act like on a kill then move on, they were doing this earlier. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
T075A
toting around a harbour seal by the hind flippers in
Oak Bay
. -Mark Malleson
*

1:30 pm - A pod of at least 5 orcas
(including one of the largest I've ever seen) passed by
Oak Bay
(between Oak Bay Marina and Oak Bay Beach Hotel). -Barb Floyd
ID notes by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whaler Research: "The bull is T75A and the group looks like it may be the group we had up here recently of T75, T75A, and the T73A's."
*

1:13 pm -
Orca pod spotted near
Apple Tree Cove from the Kingston / Edmonds
ferry boat. Appeared to be a decent size pod - maybe 8 or so orcas? One obvious male dorsal & several females. Very cool to see them on such a beautiful day! -Evelyn Daniels
*

12:50 pm -
I was at
Richmond Beach
and saw 2 from the shore with binoculars heading north. -Joni Barnes Pollino
*

11:35 am - from Shoreline
see lots of churning water and a lot of gull activity in same general area as earlier report. Thinking they must have found some food.

11:15 am -
they are making good time. From north
Seattle/Carkeek
area caught a glimpse...they are west of mid channel out from about Faye Bainbridge. -Alisa, Orca Network
*
Captain Ana heard about
6 transient orcas heading North near Colvos Passage
, so we took the Chilkat down to Seattle and
found those 6 T's! THEN 4-5 more T's come up on the other side of us, and THEN 2-3 more pop up in front of us!!
We were the only boat with them for quite some time, killed the engines quite a bit so we could watch and listen, breaches, tail slaps, spy hops and an eagle. We stayed with them
to Kingston
and then made the long trek back to the Edmonds Marina, LOL. -Janine Harles
*
T37B
(on the right) leads the way as another spyhops. -Janine Harles

11:59 am -
Across from
Kayu Kayu and Richmond Beach
now. On a kill!

11:44 am -
Came back together now and looked to be hunting. Heading towards
Richmond Beach
. Others still closer to Bainbridge side.

10:50 am -
Still heading north just south of
Shilshole Bay
Marina now. One group mid channel and a few closer to Bainbridge side.

10:12 am -
Two groups in
Elliot Bay
heading north closer to Bainbridge side. Right now. Both groups look to have calves or at least a juvenile. No adult males yet. One group has at least 5 and the other has about the same. -Renee Beitzel, Naturalist
*
Approx.

7:45 a.m
. a pod of
6 orcas
were heading north in
Colvos Passage
between Vashon Island and Kitsap Peninsula. These orcas were 2 miles south of the Southworth ferry terminal when spotted earlier. We watched until they passed the north tip of Vashon. -Sharon Yale Mitchell
*
My sister said there were
20 orcas spotted just north of Gig Harbor
where she lives. -Nancy Masner-Whiton
*
While kayaking thought
Colvos passage
in the morning we encountered this
pod of Orcas as they headed north
. -Dennis Caines
