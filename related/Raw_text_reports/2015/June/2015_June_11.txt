5pm -
Fred Michelson called in a report of
2-3 orcas mid-channel traveling west between the south tip of Anderson Island and the Nisqually delta
. He said they have been covering the same route almost every afternoon since
June 6. He says one male has a distinctive dorsal fin. He writes: "2-3 orcas were in front of our home during late afternoon
June 6 and 7 swimming in mid channel between Anderson Island and south shore of the Nisqually reach moving east to west. Watched them for about 30 minutes till they went out of sight to the west heading toward Johnsons Point. The same occurred the next day
June 7. Another sighting was made on late morning of
June 8 off the southeast tip of Anderson Island and they moved toward the DuPont shoreline and toward the Nisqually Delta but didn't see them again."

8:40 am -
We believe these are the same whales I reported today from the weekend and this week which I reported earlier today. Now they came again today (it appears 2 and I am thinking one is young) but not a new born. They seem transient because no pod is seen. They are on the same course and same exact spot and heading the same direction. It is as if they like the chances of catching prey so the cycle that brings them back here everyday is productive. It is in the Nisqually Reach from the outer Delta of the Nisqually River Delta traveling east to west past the south shore of Anderson Island toward Johnsons Point or Devils Head. We lost sight of them as they moving westerly about 2-3 miles from where we live on 52d Lane NE Olympia Wa. -Fred Michelson
