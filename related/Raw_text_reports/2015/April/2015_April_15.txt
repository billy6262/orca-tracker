Orca Sightings for April 15, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
BABIES! What an incredibly beautiful day spent with
J pod
. They spent most of the morning really spread out off the
west side of San Juan Island
, but early in the
afternoon
, the entire pod grouped very tightly together just as we began our encounter. What a treat to see the new youngsters sandwiched amongst their families, popping about like corks here and there. You have to keep a sharp eye for them though! Those little rascals surface so quickly that if you blink, you will miss them. -Katie Jones

I saw what appeared to be a pod of
6-8 orcas between the Fauntleroy ferry dock
in West Seattle and the
Vashon ferry dock
on Vashon Island. They were there for several hours from late AM to early PM. They were far away but could clearly see dorsal fins and white markings on their sides...They were very active and splashing around a lot but staying in the same basic area the whole time. Eventually a small boat approached them and was very close to them (NOAA Research boat). -Donn Bennett

We had the
T65A's, T65B's, T75B's and T75C
. There was a new calf that was with T75B most of the day but T65B was also near it. It still had fetal folds and the fin is still bent over.
T65A2
was carrying around part of the kill that they were working when we arrived. -Candice Emmons, NOAA, NWFSC

2:00 pm -
Brad Hanson of NOAA's NWFSC reports that he and crew have identified the
T65As and the T65Bs
in the
Vashon/Fauntleroy ferry lane
, feasting on something that seems to have been a large mammal from the bits and pieces left behind. They haven't moved far in several hours but seem to have possibly started trending northward.

Wow! Now watching from the ferry I can confirm they are
on a kill
. A lot of surface activity: lunging, cartwheels, breaching, circling in coordinated movements. The pod of
8+ orcas
(including mature male and young ones) have kept to the same general area (south of the east bound ferry lanes). Tail lobbing and series of 5 to 6 breaches which elicited happy boisterous responses from some ferry riders!

10:35 am -

Fauntleroy ferry dock
see them breaching and lunging, mid channel same spot south of Vashon ferry. Look to be on a kill. I am getting on the
10:40 ferry! -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Just before
8 PM
, I was sitting out on the deck enjoying a calm still evening, hoping to hear a whale, when "whoosh"!
A single gray whale
was feeding just inside the drop-off line. Feeding was quite shallow, with not a lot of blows. I watched as it made its way slowing toward
Mabana
against an apricot sunset. Spectacular! There are also getting to be noticeably more whale feeding pits visible on the beach, so I know gray whales have been by, even if I haven't seen them. -Barbara Brock Mabana, Camano Island

two grays in Possession Sound

Hat Island
....This is the first time he has seen a whale, so we are all excited. We are heading back to the marina and going to call it a day-no wind. -Sharon Ann Clark
