Orca Sightings for April 19, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
J52 is a male!
-Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research
*
L87 Onyx
spiced things up a bit breaching several times without warning! Love this big guy! Born in 1992. -Heather McIntyre
*
I'm in love with this kid. I got to "meet" one of the new calves in J-pod today, little
J51
. When I first saw him he was on his side trying to slap his pec fin on the water with his mom. It was super cute! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Stunning day on the water! I spent all day watching
J Pod in Haro Strait
today. Their behavior suggested that they were very serious about
foraging
, and were spread six miles at one point. The more time these orcas spend spread out, broken up into small family groups foraging, the less socializing they are able to do. Socializing is incredibly important for these whales, and often leads to breeding interaction. With a population hovering around just eighty orcas, they need to be breeding! We did get to see
all three of the new J Pod calves
and some social behavior towards the end of the day. J50 was as spunky as ever and spent much of her time with older sister, J42 Echo. This is the first time I've seen J42 Echo babysitting. What a special matriline the J16's are, but then, I'm a bit bias! Goodnight all you orca lovers! -Heather McIntyre
*
I've barely had time to process the amazing transient encounter from last night, when
J-Pod
shows up on the
west side
this morning! Here's J41 Eclipse - the youngest-ever documented Southern Resident mother - and her two month old son J51. -Monika Wieland

Had a wonderful encounter with
Jpod on the west side of San Juan Island
! -Traci Walter

Anyone else hearing this unique
whistling on Lime Kiln
? It was awesome! -Vickie Doyle

Very active
Orcas at Lime Kiln
right now! -Chloe Ross
*

11:00 am -
After we heard the whales on the
Limekiln hydrophone
, we headed for the lighthouse. We saw probably the last 3rd of
JPod
swim by (we missed the babies!). They were very spread out. They had a few instances of playfulness - several tail lobs and at least 8 breaches. The best part was J2 Granny, J34 DoubleStuf and another female swimming by - they passed very close to shore and came up for air right in front of the lighthouse. It was a beautiful day for whales! -Colleen Moore

, maybe more. We watched them from the
3 Sisters Farm
, Oak Harbor, heading north east at 6pm, but then they came back! Watched them from
8-
8:20pm
just circling in the mouth of the cove - lots of tail slaps, and breaches by the little one. Water was very calm, they seemed to be playing. -Caroline Renard
*

7:43 pm -
Finally picked them up again. They turned and are heading south. They are
south of Oak Harbor
but north of Penn Cove. I'm heading home but will watch from above Woodland Beach.

Small pod of orcas just south of the

Today's benefit whale watch brought us to the
Snohomish delta
where we found gray whale
#383
wearing a bright orange suction-cup and beloved Patch,
#49
side-by-side. Soon veteran researcher John Calambokidis from Cascadia Research pulled up to the Mystic Sea in an inflatable boat from which he and his assistants had just attached the tag to the whale. John told us this was the last day of three days of tagging research, with two more days of photo-identification studies to follow. The tags yield a wide array of information about gray whale behavior underwater, from dive depth, duration, angles of descent and ascent, and feeding methods. Most exciting is that the tag includes a video camera to record the pit-feeding maneuvers to bring up ghost shrimp buried over a foot deep in the mud. More about the gray whale field studies can be found on the Cascadia Research Collective facebook page. We also found gray whale
#53
feeding on his side with a flipper and fluke tip waving in the air a few miles off the Tulalip Reservation.-Susan & Howard, Orca Network
*

3:00-
5:00pm -
It was a beautiful and sunny with lots of passengers on Orca Network's fundraising cruise this afternoon. We searched out the
gray whales close to Everett
, and learned that Cascadia Research had just tagged whale
#383
and Cascadia (John Calambokidis) stopped by the Mystic Sea to explain what they were doing. #383's tag/camera was quite visible, it would most likely have dropped off the whale by late this afternoon. Traveling with #383 was everybody's favorite #49 Patch! Had some great views of them both, then went off to find
#53
(sometimes known as "Little Patch") who was a little further south. All too quickly it was time to head back to port - it was an exciting and fun trip today aboard the Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

6:50 pm -
Just saw three very large spouts just north of
Jetty island in Everett
. I saw two blows at the same time, so more than one whale out there! Can't believe I left without my binoculars!! -Holly Balley Aprecio
*

5:30 pm - Gray feeding all along the Mabana shore
...Lots of happy people enjoying a beautiful sunny Sunday, topped off with watching and listening to the whale. Lots of excited kids also. I overheard one say, "I love where we live!" Couldn't agree more. -Barbara Brock
*

11:14am -
Blows off the south end of
Hat Island
. Looks to be 2-3 maybe even more
Grey whales.
They are trending south east. -Danielle Pennington

Northern Puget Sound gray whale update:
19 April was our final day of suction cup tag deployments on gray whales and we successfully deployed
2 camera tags
on whales. The first was brief when a 2nd whale knocked the tag off the whale within the first few minutes which damaged the fragile flotation on this tag and took it out of action though this did show the level social contact and interaction among these animals. Our
2nd tag (on ID 383
) was of a different design with a single wide angle camera in front (this tag also constructed by Custom Animal Tracking Solutions working in collaboration with Stanford) and this represented only the 2nd deployment of this tag design on a whale. This
tag stayed on into the evening
before we recovered it and we are just starting to download and look at the images (see below) and data. Some of the initial video showed this whale in contact with the bottom and also filming a 2nd whale ahead (Patch) who appeared to also be feeding on the bottom off Hat Island. Overall these trips have provided more data than we expected both from the tags as well as the fecal samples, photo-IDs, and behavior monitoring. After studying these whales for more than 20 years, the video and tag data provide a perspective we have never before had. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research Collective
