Orca Sightings for April 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
On the last update
on 6 April, L84 was off Willapa Bay
. L84 was traveling north and by
8 April he was near La Push
where our colleagues from Cascadia Research Collective were able to intercept a group of Southern Residents traveling north. The whales were very spread out but the individuals they saw included
members of both L pod (but not including L84) and J pod
. They were able to collect 4 prey and 1 fecal sample. However, L84 had turned south by the afternoon of the 8th so Cascadia staff launched out of Westport
on the 9th and were able to intercept L84 and a few other L pod members just off Grays Harbor
and collect 2 more prey and 1 more fecal sample. As of this morning
(10 April) the whales were about were they were on the 6th, just off the entrance to Willapa Bay
