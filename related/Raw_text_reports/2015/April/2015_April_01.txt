We had the

T049A's
east bound
off of Victoria
in the
afternoon
. Thanks to Paul from Sooke Explorations for the initial heads up of inbound transients out west in the morning. -Mark Malleson

6:48pm - Gray whale Mabana Beach Camano Island
near shore.
Moving south.
-Sally Olin
*

6:24pm - Three whales.
Heading west. Just saw one do a spy hop. Not sure if that is the correct terminology for grey whales.

6:00pm - Blows off the south end of Gedney Island
. I am assuming it's a grey whale based on the length between blows. Pretty stationary. -Danielle Pennington

Amazing encounter with whales

Camano Head
aboard the Island Explorer 3. A feeding frenzy in shallow waters that we will forever remember! -Michael Colahan
