============================================================

Entry 1:
L84
was just to north of the entrance to
Grays Harbor
, but well offshore, on our previous update (20 April). The whales moved inshore that afternoon, to just off the entrace to Grays Harbor, but by the morning of the 21st they had traveled due west and were on the shelf break. They headed north/northeast and were just north of Cape Elizabeth on the morning of the 22nd. From there they traveled south and by the
morning of the 23rd were near the entrance to the Columbia River
. They remained in this general area overnight and as of this morning (24 April) they were just north of Cape Disappointment. Map photo courtesy of Brand Hanson, NOAA, NMFSC Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging
