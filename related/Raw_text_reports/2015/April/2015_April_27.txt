We watched the
T036A's and T049B's
take out a Harbour porpoise
south of Discovery Island
in the morning. They got another one at mid day north of
Middle Bank
. They continued traveling east along the
west side of San Juan Island past Eagle Point
and then jagged out to Hein Bank before continuing east to
Rosario Strait

Today was awesome! Another beautiful day on the water. Sooke Whale Watching was going out on an adventure, so I jumped on for a ride!

I saw
2 -3 Orcas between Bowen Island and Worlcombe Island
(appr. 8 miles NW of Vancouver BC). They travelled quickly on the south side of Bowen passing Cape Roger Curtis. Looked like a large male and 2 smaller orca. They were spotted again near Deep Bay on Bowen around
3:00 pm and were headed north. Sorry no photos. Was a magical few minutes to see them. -Dianne Felsmann

My wife, Erika, and I saw
a male orca swimming just south of Point of the Arches around the southern tip of Shi Shi beach
(very northern end of Olympic National Park, south of the Makah Indian Reservation.) We had just walked through one of the smaller set of arches south of the point when we saw the huge, 6-foot dorsal fin emerge three times for surface breaths while swimming steadily southeast through the seastacks toward Ozette. It did not linger, and we did not see any other dorsals or sign of other orcas. The sighting was not long enough to take any photos, but it was a truly amazing, thrilling experience. We have seen the superpod in the San Juans, but this unexpected glimpse at a wilderness beach was magnificent. Time was approximately 1 p.m. ...he was swimming steadily, three surface breaths at regular five-to-10-second intervals. That weekend we observed many seals sunning on the numerous rocks and seastacks in this area, and we saw a few swimming, too. We assume the orca was a transient, only because we saw no other orcas, but we have no way of knowing. The very tall dorsal left no doubt it was a male, and we saw a fair amount of the body emerge during each breath -- he was a big guy. Once he disappeared behind a nearby seastack, we never got another glimpse. Sight angles are tight at that spot, a lot of obstructions. But the orca passed us fairly close to the arches where we were -- we did not need binoculars at all. -Scott Morris

We have seen
two grays
much of the
afternoon
-they seem to be making big circles around
Possession Sound
. We watched them feeding on the flats and head toward Hat Island, then back toward the flats. We saw some great tail slaps today! My stepson (Michael Clark) got lots of photos (see below), and I will post some when we get back. My stepson smelled blow for the first time, too-LOL. Last we saw, they were heading in the
direction of Langley
. That was about

4:30

3:55 pm -

Kayak County Park
...looking south see blows mid channel approx.
between Camano Head and Tulalip
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

3:05 pm -
We just saw at least
one gray whale on the flats near shadow of Pilchuk
. I think there are more than one-clearly feeding. We aren't close enough to get good photos-now they are moving north-at least two. My birthday is complete-just wish I had a telephoto lens... -Sharon Ann Clark
