Trip report - The weatherman was good to us, the rain held off and we found whales! Heading south from Langley, we caught up with two favorites -
Gray whales #49 Patch, and #44 Dubknuck
as they traveled back and forth
between Hat Island and the Clinton ferry dock
. It was a little choppy, but we still had some great views of them. We heard of another whale feeding along the Langley shoreline and found #22, busily feeding on her side, many views of her pectoral fin and 'half' her tail fluke as she scooped up those little shrimp from the sediment. We watched her travel from Langley to Sandy Point. Many people in Langley watched her pass by from Whale Bell Park. It was a good day on the water! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Another day, another whale. Such is the reinvigorated whale season on Whidbey Island. It is windy, cool and chucking rain today after a blue-skied Sunday, but the boats were out whale watching regardless. Hardy souls who love water-bound mammals enjoying the feeding frenzy along
Langley Beach
again today. You'll see how windy it was from the breath spout photos. As soon as a spout happened, the wind carried it away. The boats were keeping a respectful distance from this incredible scene of
gray whales dining on the ghost shrimp
. In 2013 a group of concerned citizens formed a grassroots effort and with Langley Mayor Fred McCarthy lobbied the Department of Natural Resources to stop the ghost shrimp fishing along our shores. And won! As a result of their committed actions we are reaping the benefit because this is the fourth time this spring we've spotted feeding along our beaches. Last year, only once, and the same the year before. A good indication that if the
ghost shrimp are plentiful
, so are the gray whales who feed on them. The forecast Wednesday through next Monday is sunny and in the 60s, and the Welcome The Whales festival and parade is Saturday. A great time to hop a ferry or cross Deception Pass Bridge and head to Langley. Oh, and bring your cameras. You'll be sorry if you don't. -Debra Campbell
