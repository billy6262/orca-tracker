J52 was next to J36
for the entire encounter, there is no reason to believe it is anyone else's calf other than J36. We will let everyone know if the situation changes in any way." -Center for Whale Research

...After our normal trip (out with J16s) as we were getting ready to get off the boat, a friend and fellow whale watch captain who was on the ferry said there were
whales INSIDE of Friday Harbor
