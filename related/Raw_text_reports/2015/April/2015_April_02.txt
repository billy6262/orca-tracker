Orca Sightings for April 2, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
After work I followed up a report of
killer whales spotted south of Discovery
by a colleague out fishing. I went out searching and came across
T065, T063, and T049C
west bound
south of Constance Bank
. I left them south of Race still tracking west. On my way home I came across the T065A's west of Constance Bank also tracking west. -Mark Malleson

T063 south west of Constance Bank heading out the Juan de Fuca.

9:30am - Saw 3 Orcas,
1 was a calf, off of
Libby Beach
(due
west of Coupeville
, near Partridge Pt. and Partridge Bank) took some photos of them and was wondering what pod they were from. (Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research looked through many photos and ID'd the pod as the
T36As and T49Bs
) -Linda Noack
*

8:30am -
from Chatham Lane, just south of
Hastie Lake Rd
. (NW Whidbey - between Coupeville & Oak Harbor) Patty and I saw
a female Orca and young one heading south
about 200 yards from shore at a steady pace. -David Cohick

Trip report - Sunny skies and calm seas, we headed south from Langley and before long one of our passengers spotted the first "blow".... we found
two whales
, to the west of Hat Island.
#21 and #22
traveling together towards
Hat Island
in a feeding pattern - several surfaces and then a dive - giving us some good looks at #22's fluke. We continued around the north of Hat Island, and found #53, known as Little Patch. He appeared to be by himself, taking long dives. #22 was the active whale for us today, she and #21 mugged the boat at one point, giving us an exceptional view of these magnificent whales. Another super day aboard the Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
