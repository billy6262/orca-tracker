Orca Sightings for April 5, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had an amazing day with the
T36A's and the T49B's south of San Juan Island
today. They seemed to be munching on something as there were lots of birds around picking up scraps. The whales lolly-gagged around all afternoon and it was wonderful to spend that time with them. As you can see, the scenery wasn't too shabby either. -Katie Jones

Spent an incredible evening at
Fox Spit
, Whidbey Island in Saratoga Passage watching
3 gray whales
from shore...whales scooping shrimp and close to shore. I almost fainted...WOW...you could almost touch them...you could feel their mist and smell their breath! The sea lions and birds were happy too. -Marilyn Armbruster

6:58 pm -
Most headed towards
baby island
now. One rounded the corner and is headed south now. What an amazing incredible day!!! At times the whales came within 30 feet of the beach! We watched them for 2.5 hours!!!

5:25 pm -
They are very active near shore in front of that beach community below Saratoga road on Whidbey across from
south end of Camano Island state park
. Lots of blows and churning water.

5:06 pm -
Whidbey folks, they are headed your way fast. Lots of blows lots of tail views. They are well north of Langley but seem headed in that direction.

2:53 pm - 2 grays headed into Elger Bay
(Camano Island). -Krista Paulino
*

3:00 pm -
From Whidbey shores, looking east then west. The seagulls are enjoying the crumbs left by
at least 4 greys
. Mostly together, sometimes in couples. We are THRILLED to have our friends back after 3 or 4 years of few sightings which we now attribute to the commercial ghost shrimp culling. Easter Sunday, 3pm, for 2 hours, these whales enjoyed high tide and
rolled in the beach feeding
and, we think, celebrating. They were at most 30 feet from our deck at high tide. We are overjoyed to welcome these magnificent creatures back in our 'hood. -Penny Thackeray

1:28 pm - Two (maybe three) Gray whales
who just seems to be milling/feeding up north
between East Whidbey and West Camano Island
(s) - in Saratoga Passage. -Stu Davidson

a Gray whale
just off possession beach heading south. I believe it was just one. It was moving pretty fast. -Tiffany Reynolds
