Orca Sightings for April 23, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We started off with gray skies and light rain, but that didn't deter our passengers or the whales! Heading south we found
#44 Dubknuck south-west of Hat Island
- heading towards the Clinton Ferry. He showed us his fluke (tail) several times as he continued on south. We then turned north towards Camano Island, and found 3 more whales near Port Susan. One was a bit elusive and we could not identify, but the other two were
#21 and #22
, traveling together southbound. We had some really good viewing of these two as they surfaced in tandem several times, and by the time we headed for Langley - the sun was out! A great day again aboard the Mystic Sea. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
