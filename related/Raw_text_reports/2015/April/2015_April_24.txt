L84 and likely at least a few other L pod members
were headed north off the
Long Beach Peninsula
, in southwest Washington. By the morning of the

they were off the
entrance to Grays Harbor
where they remained through the 26th. By the
27th
they were headed south, off the entrance to
Willipa Bay
in the morning and off
Cape Disappointment
by that afternoon. They made a loop back to the north off the Long Beach Peninsula on the 28th but by the morning of the 29th they were off Nestucca Bay, in northern Oregon. They reversed direction and headed north such that by the morning of the 30th they were off the entrance to the Columbia River and the entrance to Willipa Bay by that afternoon.

Markus and I went for a walk and randomly saw whales! Here is a photo of a
J pod
mum and calf swimming past the
Oak Bay (Victoria, BC)
golf course. Prior to that, we watched a number of killer whales traveling east bound in the Juan de Fuca strait from the Victoria shoreline. Spyhops, pec slapping, tail slapping, was observed. -Maria Chantelle Tucker.

3 J Pod babies just off Sooke BC
, off Otter Point this morning about

10:30/11 am
! Captain Paul from Sooke Coastal Explorations had a hunch that Jpod would be coming in front of Sooke. Wendy Cooke Lang and I went with Paul to see. It wasn't far until Wendy spotted at least 7 blows. Paul counted
about 20 whales

3:00 pm - J-Pod headed NE past Metchosin towards Victoria
... Watching from shore. They're pretty far out there but the big dorsal fins are easy to see! They're clipping along at a fast pace; about four commercial whale-watch vessels in the surrounding area.

Thanks to Paul from Sooke Explorations for relaying a sighting of
killer whales off of Sheringham Pt.
we were able to catch up with the
J16's west of Jordan River
. They were moving quickly west out the Juan de Fuca Strait. No sign of the rest of Jpod but likely well ahead. -Mark Malleson

Was out on an adventure with Sooke Coastal Whale Watching! We found
Jpod off of Sheringham Lighthouse
(Sooke, BC). There were 2 babies. One of them was jumping out of the water. It was way too fast to capture at the time. Towards the end of our visit with them I got a bit of footage of the wee one hanging with his momma! -Deanna Brett

There are no fewer than
five grays in Port Susan today at Kayak Point
. One of them had a large patch of tan-colored barnacles on head. #21? -Gary Lingenfelter
