Entry 1:
J36 and J52 at San Juan Island

The
J16 matriline
did the
west side shuffle off San Juan Island
today. On the water we watched them travel from
False Bay to Hannah Heights between
13:45 and
14:30
. Then back on shore they milled off
Lime Kiln from

15:30-
16:30
, apparently foraging, before slowly continuing north...The J16s have been the only J-Pod whales around for the last couple of days, which is a bit odd, but maybe it has something to do with the fact that two of our newest members are in their family group. It was great to see two very active babies in
J50 (mom J16 Slick) and J52 (mom J36 Alki)
, and also to see that the whale watch boats were all voluntarily giving the family lots of extra space. -Monika Wieland

J16 Matriline
Report. We spent the afternoon and evening with the J16 matriline, including the two new calves,
J50 and J52
. The orcas were spread out off the
west side of San Juan Island
foraging. The females and calves stayed almost exclusively inshore, while J26 Mike would repeatedly forage off shore. It was amazing to watch J50 though, she is such an independent and spunky calf! J16 Slick is not going to have it easy keeping track of this little one! J50 was close to the others, but not right at her mother's side as you may expect. She was seen engaging with all of the family members, and it would seem that J26 Mike was babysitting for some of the time. We saw J26 Mike act out a variety of behaviors including tail slapping, kelping, pectoral slaps as he rolled through the water, and breaching. Whether J26 was using this behavior as a foraging tactic, or just for fun remains up for question! It seemed that the whales were in a "down to business" mode yesterday, and were very serious about foraging- as they should be with two lactating females in the group.
The most interesting behavior we witnessed came just towards the end of our first trip when most of the orcas were heading north again, but one stayed behind. Yep, you guessed it, J50 stayed behind and became quite social. It seemed that she was acting out similar behaviors as J26 (big brother) that we had seen a short time before. J50 started to roll through the water as well, trying to slap her pectoral flippers, as well as spyhopping (I can't tell you how adorable it was to see a bright pink/orange calf rolling through the water trying to pectoral slap). By the end of her playfulness J52 had also joined in socializing, and the orcas seemed to come back around to escort the playful calves north again. These mothers are certainly going to have their "flippers" full with these two little ones! The calves definitely seem very healthy, and with such a high mortality rate (50% or more), we hope there will soon be ample salmon filling these waters to ensure they always stay healthy. -Heather McIntyre, Legacy Charters
