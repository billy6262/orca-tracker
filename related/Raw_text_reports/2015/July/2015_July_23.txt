Orca Sightings for July 23, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30am -
1:00pm - Some of J, K and L pods
this morning. They were at
Kellett Bluff
, heading towards Waldron when we left them, around 1 pm. Magic! Superpod for SP4 folks, what a wonderful privilege! -Jill Hein
*

8:58 pm -
This pair of orcas, including who I'm almost positive is
J27 Blackberry
, have been in the same exact spot
off Land Bank for at least 3 hours now
....I was wondering who the other whale might be... He came in a little closer off and on and we could hear him breathing a few times, I got quite a few looks of both saddles over those hours. -Rachel Haight
*
Day report: we got to
Lime Kiln State Park at
8:15am
and spent all day there
until 7 pm
we then went to Land Bank/West Side Preserve.
Groups of J, K and L per Jeanne Hyde and James Taylor.
9:30 am,
10:30 am and
11:30 am with that last group leaving around noonish, including K44 Ripple and his mom K27 Deadhead northbound
. Then Jeanne said the small group of
J22's Oreo, Cookie and Doublestuf
and someone else further out came back south
at
2:30
. Then another group back north at 6 pm. At 7PM met up with Rachel Haight at Land Bank and watched a couple of others (see Rachel's report above)...I watched a lot of orca's and that is all that matters, my heart was filled-nothing better than just sitting on those rocks and just being in the pure moment(s)! -Marilyn Armbruster
*
A few highlights from today. We had
group A of J pod, J37, J14, J45, J40, J41, J19 heading up Swanson Channel
but then back tracked to see
K's and L's in Boundary
. Spectacular day! Whales everywhere! -Gary Sutton
*
Lots of whales including
all J's except for J27 J31 and J39
I think.
Only K13's and then K21 and K16 and K35
and as far as Ls we had
L72 L105 L95 L92 and L55's
. Not sure if I saw L47. I don't recall seeing L47s but there were a lot of whales and I took a lot of pics....Looks like they may have split- J's up Swanson and rest up Boundary - 2nd group def went Boundary Pass. -Barbara Bender
*
We were fortunate to be out with
members of all 3 pods today off Henry Island and NW San Juan Island between
11:30 am and 1 pm
. Breaches and tail lobs and tight groups of porpoising orcas - first heading north then south and then turning north again. There were reports of more orcas off SW San Juan Island as well. It was great to see several large, tight groups rather than the spread out behavior we've been seeing so much of. -Susan Berta, ON
