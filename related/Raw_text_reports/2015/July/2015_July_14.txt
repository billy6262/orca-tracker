Orca Sightings for July 14, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Pretty sweet day! My first trip driving for Seabreeze and they were right on our doorstep! (
Richmond, BC
) It was pretty cool to see little
J51
spending a lot of time away from mom and hanging out and playing with
J47
!
J47 "Notch"
breached beside
J35
while an eagle hovers in the near distance-Gary Sutton

The Resident orcas sure have been going the distance lately...members of
J and K Pod
went north again, through
Active Pass
. Active Pass has got to me one of my most favorite spots to watch orcas.
L87
Onyx and
J2
Granny. I love the bond these two have. For those of you that don't know, J2 adopted L87 after he was orphaned, and after the members of K Pod that he traveled with died. L87 has seen a lot of loss in his short life, but hopefully with J2 by his side he feels a sense of security. -Heather MacIntyre

We left at
9am
and were on scene with
orcas
by

9:45 west of Naval Air Station
, Whidbey Island (Rosario Strait). The orcas were very spread out (by the time we left for home, the orcas were separated by 18 miles), and the groups we caught up with were slowly meandering west. It was an incredibly relaxing trip where we were able to sit and let the orcas parade by. We also spotted a pair of tufted puffins and later found a bait ball with a harbor seal and spiny dogfish actively feeding. The last groups of whales to pass us were
J16 & J50 followed by J36 & J52
, a treat to see both babies! J52 was breaching, spyhopping, and porpoising as he passed by. Beautiful morning on the water. -Rachel Haight
