Leigh Novak reports seeing
a small Gray whale at dusk on the 22nd heading north towards Dyes Inlet

on the morning of the 23rd by it's blows. She has been hearing and seeing a whale over the past few weeks between Manette Bridge and Wheaton Ave/Warren Bridge, Bremerton. Primarily she has been hearing blows at night and what sounds like breaching or pec slapping. Last week was the first she could ID as a gray.
