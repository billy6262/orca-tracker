============================================================

Entry 1:

Active Pass, BC
. -Heather MacIntyre

Well it was a bumpy ride getting there yesterday but we had a WHOLE LOT OF RESIDENTS!
All of J's, All of K's and most of L's in Swanson Channel
heading into Active Pass. It's been so long since I've seen so many of them together....incredible day....even with a boat breakdown on my way home. -Gary Sutton
*
We had some rather eerie lighting effects and cloud cover due to the wildfires as we neared Vancouver Island, B.C. With reports of L pod whales in the area, we were delighted to see
Crewser (L92) and Ballena (L90)
as these whales had not been seen in the San Juans this year.
Racer (L72) and Fluke (L105)
were also spotted and confirmed by the Center for Whale Research, which carries out an annual census of the endangered Southern Resident orcas. The whales were actively hunting for their favorite food, the Omega rich Chinook (King) salmon, with some fast porpoising and tail-slaps. -Sandra Pollard

Awesome night in
Howe Sound
with the
T46's
(Bigg's/Transient orcas). I can't remember seeing this group before so it was pretty special. It was our first sunset eco tour of the season and we had killer whales and an epic sunset! -Gary Sutton
