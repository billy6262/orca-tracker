Orca Sightings for July 4, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just checked in on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone at approximately
8:43pm
. Heard very faint
calls
that sounded like S1's... Likely J pod. However a vessel of some sort arrived at around
8:50 making it too loud to hear SRKW, and the calls seem to have disappeared since the boat has been gone. -Grace Guiney
