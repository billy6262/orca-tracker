traveling, fishing, breaching, goofing around. Moving from
False Bay to Eagle Poin
t. Can count about 15 but rougher water makes it hard to see them all. Group of about 8 were in close to shore and continued past Eagle Point - at least two large males along with little ones and females. About
6-10 orcas
are out further and are still hanging around at

Hello! My daughters and I visited
Lime Kiln
and a large group orcas passed by. They were moving quickly and were spread out. It was our first experience seeing
orcas
and it was incredible. We were able to get only one decent picture and was hoping you could confirm the identity. We downloaded the ID survey and believe this is
Kasatka L82
. (confirmed) -Christina Massimino

J, K, and L pod (minus the L12s and L54s) came back down from the North
. Out on the Odyssey of San Juan Excursions, we caught up with the orcas as they headed
towards San Juan Island from Stuart Island
. They were all very spread out. We saw the
K13s first and Skagit K13
caught a salmon right off our bow! She could have called to her adult son,
Scoter K25
, who was nearby because he then rushed over to her and they both dove. I am inclined to think that they shared the salmon underwater. I think
Comet K38 (Skagit K13's grandson)
also caught a salmon a few minutes later. He then played with some kelp afterwords. Next, we saw the J19s and the
K14s
(and may more orcas in the distance) who were inshore of us, and then the
K16s
, including
Cappuccino K21
, passed by. We saw the
K12s, L4s and L47s
last. -Melisa Pinnow

Another epic day on the water! We've had wonderful encounters with members of
J, K, and L pods
the past few days. They have been spending much of their time swimming together in massive social groups and today was no different. We had huge groups of whales swimming tightly together
in the Strait Georgia
spending much of their time socializing. As they neared East Point on Saturna Island, the whales spread out all the way across the strait in such a way that we couldn't have gone back to the dock if we wanted to. They were everywhere in a proverbial
whale soup
breaching, spyhopping, and cartwheeling in every direction we looked! What a happy problem to have! -Katie Jones

Members of
J Pod
headed southwest from the
Fraser River
Saturday
morning. J2 Granny
is center front with little
J51's
eye patch visible just ahead of her dorsal. It was wonderful watching members of
all 3 pods
heading southwest from the
Fraser River
Saturday morning. They were in large groups and heavily involved in social behaviors, spyhopping and breaching. -James Gresham
