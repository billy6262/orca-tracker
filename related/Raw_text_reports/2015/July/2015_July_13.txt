I was awakened by
loud blows at
5:12am at Eagle Cove
, looked out and there were
15 +/- whales
frolicking in the bay! Several large males, females and youngsters, all close together, very tactile behavior, rolling around, floating on their backs, tail slapping, pec slapping (looked like he was waving good morning) and several graceful spy hops. The littlest one did two partial breaches! So cute! They just swam around
Eagle Point slowly heading north
in a tight and playful family group! What a great way to start the day! I have a feeling its going to be an amazing whale day! -Lodie Budwill
