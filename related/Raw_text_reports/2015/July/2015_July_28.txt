Some
orcas
were here all day, back and forth. I didn't count numbers as I was doing yardwork etc., but every time I looked out some whales were in view. I just saw a couple breaches at

8:38 PM

Se-Yi-Chn (J45

T'ilem I'nges (J49)
and
Kelp (K42)
tonight with members of
J and K pod near Hein Bank
. It was so beautiful out there even as the swell picked up a bit. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
J51
popped up right in frame. I would not have gotten this shot if he hadn't seemed to know exactly where to be. One of those lucky, lucky shots. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Our evening trip was very peaceful. We spent the majority of it shut down, drifting, and listening to the orcas. We were watching a small bunch of the
J17 matriline
. I kept joking, saying, "Come on Notch (the five year old orca here), come say hi to me, it's my birthday after all". And he would do another long dive, foraging and pop up somewhere nowhere near where I expected...This went on for about an hour until finally, he did just what I was hoping he'd do. He went out of his way to come up to us and make the connection. He came up on the stern of the boat while we were shut down (where I watched from the roof), and swarm around, rolling on his side to look up at me. I've never had this connection from
J47 Notch
before. -Heather MacIntyre

I'm seeing them again on the web cam very close to shore - lucky onlookers! -Shelby Hight Fifield
*
We headed out of town with reports of
Southern Resident killer whales heading south along the west side of San Juan Island
, and were fortunate to find many
members of both J and K pods
hugging the shoreline, hopefully finding lots of salmon to eat. We recognized
K-25 Scoter
and other members of the
K13s
, and then found
J-27 Blackberry
slightly offshore - he gave us some wonderful views as he foraged (and caught) salmon. Homeward bound we found harbor seals hauled out (some with new pups), and harbor porpoise. A beautiful day again - what an amazing summer we're having!! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
*

10:00 am -
We met up with
Js and most of Ks (didn't see the K16s or K21)
near
False Bay
on the am trip. Everyone kind of moseyed in from the north and south and all grouped up right before we left. I think I got at least 17 dorsals in one shot which is a new record for me. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
