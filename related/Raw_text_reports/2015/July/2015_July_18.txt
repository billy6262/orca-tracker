Orca Sightings for July 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:30 pm -
We watched the evening run off the
West coast of San Juan Island
, this evening.
3-5 orcas
(including one of the baby's) traveling and playing. -Josh Fuller
*
We had a whale-filled afternoon and evening, collecting data from J
- and K-Pod whales on shore at Lime Kiln
as they passed by four different times. It's not often you get to watch whales after sunset, but tonight was one of those nights! -Monika Wieland
*

9:15 pm - faint calls/clicks starting to be heard on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. -Cydnie Simons
*

8:51 pm -
and here they come again! Good ol'
Lime Kiln
! -James Taylor
*

8:45 pm - the J16s
just came back south.
J26 Mike
did a beauteous breach. Others now coming by.

7:20 pm -
Black and whites headed north past
Center for Whale Research
right now. -Howard, ON
*
(
July 17th) We watched
L87
Onyx travel south, and when the rest of this companions turned around and headed north, he missed the switch...The
J2's, J19's, and K14's headed all the way north, through Active Pass
, and
L87 Onyx was left by himself off the west side of San Juan Islan
d. Since I've been watching these whales for the last three years, I've never seen him alone like that. At sunset he was seen traveling up the west side alone, and on the hydrophones you could hear his calls. Orcas have specific dialects, and vocalistic traditions unique to their pod and matriline. He called out off the west side of San Juan Island into the early morning.
J2
Granny had lead her pod all the way back down south of the west side of
San Juan Island
by the morning (the 18th). Then she turned around and porpoised north at a fast pace.
Finally L87 Onyx was spotted heading to San Juan Island
from the west with a small group of K Pod whales. J2 Granny had also turned back around and was heading south. Orcas can hear extremely well, and probably heard one another once they entered into the same acoustical corridor. J2 Granny was there to meet L87 Onyx... We saw the
J2's, J16's, J19's, J22's, K13's
, and
K14's
today. Found the J16's and J22's foraging right outside of our harbor around

7:30
right before we headed in for the night. -Heather MacIntyre
*
J34
Doublestuf outside of
Snug Harbor
. His rake marks are healing, but it looks like he's still has some tissue showing. Orcas have very thin skin ... 3/4 inch thick. -Heather MacIntyre
*

6:40 pm - Vocals again on Lime Kiln hydrophone
on the west side of San Juan Island. Hearing S1 calls and echolocation. Looking forward to learning who has come in from the west and/or back south. Beautiful evening listening to Southern Residents. -Alisa, ON
*
Around
2 PM J2s, J19s, and K14s went north. At
4:30 that same group went back south. At
5:30 we could see some whales coming across Haro
(Jeanne confirmed she saw Onyx with the
K13s
in this inbound group - he was not with the J2s as usual).
At
6:30 the J16s and J22s went north
and we could see many boats to the south with more whales that never came up. At

9:15 the J16s and J22s went back south
. -Monika Wieland

We were at
Lime Kiln
today from about
3 until 5pm
. We were lucky enough to catch a few of the orcas swimming southbound at a fast pace. We walked on the ferry and used San Juan Transit just for a day trip from Seattle with hopes our visiting niece would get to see them. I've tried for over ten years to see them from Lime Kiln. Today was the day! -Kathleen Love
