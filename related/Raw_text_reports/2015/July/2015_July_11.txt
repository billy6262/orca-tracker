We saw the
orcas way north in the Swanson Channel
near N. Pender and Prevost Islands. There were several orcas and they were headed north. We went through the pass between Mayne and Galiano (Active Pass). We saw a lot of jumping salmon which leads me to believe they were feeding, but I am not sure. We saw a few tail splashes and a couple of spy hops! Absolutely wonderful! -Shari Harris

Awesome day. We saw
a male (orca)
heading north at
Lime Kiln park at 9.15 am
. Spend the day on the water. Cross a few porpoises path. And the highlight of the day: paddle along
a young minke at 4 pm
, it stayed south of the lighthouse for the about 45 minutes swimming back an forth. -Patrick Vegas

Puget Sound

11:00-
11:30am
watched
humpback between Point Defiance and Vashon Island
. When I first saw it, it was about
100 feet off of Point Defiance
. Last sighting it was closer to
SW end of Vashon.
It was always "facing" east when it came up, but was generally traveling north. I'm guessing it ended up heading up the west side of Vashon, but don't know for sure. -Levi Waggoner

Juan de Fuca Strait About Noon time
- Less than an hour out of Port Angeles we found at least
6 humpbacks including Split Fin (BCZ0298), Split Fluke (BCX1068), BCX1057, Heather (BCY0160) and her calf and possibly MM20004
(no photo's of this one.) Split fin spent as much time on his back or side as he did swimming right side up. He also breached multiple times. After all that activity the three finally settled down, just swimming along, but one of them trumpeted, a sound I had never heard in the wild. We left the first three, passed MM20004, and then spent a bit of time with Heather and her calf as they cruised east at a steady pace. -Connie Bickerton

4:00 pm - Minke
milling off
Flint Beach, Lopez Island
-Tom Reeve

And the highlight of the day: paddle along a young
minke at 4 pm

Minke
whale headed for the light house! (Lime Kiln State Park). -Casey Fitzgerald
