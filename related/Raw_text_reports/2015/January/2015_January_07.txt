Orca Sightings for January 7, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:00 PM -
We sighted a pod of
5 to 7 Orcas in Case Inlet
, east of Stretch Island. They had traveled to the north earlier in the day. When they returned to the south, they paused in this area to feed and play. They were very active in this area (including breaching a few times) for about a half hour, then continued toward Pickering Passage to the west of Harstine Island. -Jim Biermann

This
morning
I saw a large circle of disturbed water and bubbles. I knew something was up. I continued to watch and remembering the day before seeing a large
whalelike mammal
come out of the water and splash sideways twice. About 10 minutes went by...the water was calm again....and a seal appeared in the same area. It was swimming forward looking around and suddenly a large splash and back of what I think was a whale...it obviously got the seal...and all was calm again. This was in the Sinclair Inlet. We live on Perry Ave. Port Orchard, Wa. Although I did not see white on the whale...
it must have been an Orca
....To me it seemed to have more of a squared off nose almost like a humpback look. But reading about whales eating seals...Must have been an Orca. -Melissa Oberlander.
