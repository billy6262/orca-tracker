This in from Bob on Anderson Island. "Whales just sighted from the
Anderson Island Ferry at noon
looking west towards Eagle Island close to the north end of Anderson Island and the south end of McNeil Island." So they headed north and hung a west and are

between the ferry lanes and Ket. Island. 1 male, 1 juvenile and 1 or 2 females. (updated edit-Looked like they were heading north, slow possibly foraging). -Elizabeth Get Kraken Swanser

Jeanette Leah reports seeing

Cape Meares, OR,
Park Ranger Travis Corby reports seeing
a pod of one adult male and two smaller orcas two hundred yards off the cape between noon and
1:30 pm
today, heading north toward Tillamook Bay, OR. Park visitors had reported seeing more orcas - possibly up to 10 earlier in the day, and seals and sea lions were all on the rocks. He said the visitors reported the orcas were attacking a crab pots - I asked if they were doing that by tail lobbing the crab pot buoy and he said yes. This is incredible, as we've just had two reports of that happening with Transients in Puget Sound this past week - but something we have never seen or heard of before - interesting! Anyone else out there remember seeing Transients (or Residents?) attacking crab pots in the past?

After the above report was posted on the Orca Network facebook page this report of the same encounter appeared: Chris Fisher Hill I was there watching the greys at
Cape Meares and first spotted the Orcas
today. At first they were in the inlet towards the rocks with the seals. They lingered for almost half an hour working their way around the lighthouse point and off to the north. some seemed to be working in circles possibly fishing. I watched one throw, roll, slap etc the crab pot.
There were at least 10.
What a sighting of a lifetime. I still can't believe it. Oh yeah and they grey whales were abundant too!
A possible explanation: It is not uncommon that crab pot bait attracts swarms of mysiids and other zooplankton, which sometimes attracts fish. Perhaps the orca are trying to stun fish associated with the pot or buoy.
