Orca Sightings for January 13, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:00 UPDATE
- the Orcas (at least 6) in Budd Inlet went as far south as
Priest Point park
. They stayed near the center of the channel and frolicked and made a kill. They then headed north - breaching, cartwheeling, head standing and then would take long dives. They just
headed north past Boston Harbor
and are currently heading through
Dana Passage
along the eastern shore.

3:00 - South Sound Orcas (approx 5)
- came south through
Dana Passage
and very close along the
eastern shore of Budd Inlet
- passing Boston Harbor Marina and Burfoot Park. Some surfacing series in Gull Harbor and now
continuing south

About

1:30. We saw 4 orcas, north side of Johnson Point, heading west
towards Olympia. About 150' offshore. -Tina Davi

We have a rare report of
a group of possibly unknown transient orca visiting the Salish Sea
. We received a report via Ian Roberts of a group of
seven orca
off of
Secretary Island near Sooke BC
. They were last sighted heading SW. We were sent numerous photographs not matching any IDs known. This group may belong to a rarely sighted outer coast transient group. We will release more photographs once we do a bit more digging into the IDs of these animals. -Ian Roberts - Posted by Josh McInnes

1:40 PM - The 4 T068's
came back to
Tofino
yesterday. They went down Tofino inlet. It looks like there was T068B with her calf (B1 or B2 ?),also T068C & T068C1. No males. My question is, did one of the calfs die? In the ID book it says there is a B1 & B2 but I only see one calf beside T068B. Do you know which one it is? It's always right beside it's mother T068B. Cruising, feeding & Spy Hopping. T068C seems to enjoy Spy Hopping! -Wayne Barnes

7:55 AM - Pod of 5 Orca whales
sighted going through
Hammersley Inlet towards Shelton
. Traveling - moving quickly. -Barbara Andrews
*
Pacific White Sided dolphin
spotted 30 yards off beach of
west end of Anderson Island
. Just south of Amsterdam Bay. First seen around
5pm
, stuck around area until around
6pm
. There were loud blows and water sprays that I've also never seen. It was popping up in random places so it was hard to even capture video. It was not alone. There was a larger one but it was in deeper water. I spotted a sea lion in the exact area of this video a few mins prior to filming it. -Ryan Johannes

4:32 -

a dolphin and a seal playing in front of Anthony's
and the Vashon ferry now. -Ronda Walters
