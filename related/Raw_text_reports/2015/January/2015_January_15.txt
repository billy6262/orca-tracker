Orca Sightings for January 15, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
15 January update - Our previous update
(Monday,
January 12), found J27 (and the rest of J pod) approaching the western entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. The whales traveled into the open ocean, but only a short distance and for only for a brief time, before almost retracing their track back into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. By the
evening of Tuesday,
January 13 they were off Victoria
, then traveled up Haro Strait, and by the morning of the

January 14 they went through Active Pass
. By this morning,

January 15, they were off the northeast corner of Texada Island
in the northern Strait of Georgia. -Map provided by NW Fisheries Science Center

Jeanne Hyde spotted
transients from home this morning off Bellevue Pt
. somewhere around
11am
and called Dave. The whales headed north and Tom and Jane Cogan kept them in sight while Dave and Jeanne scrambled for the boat. We got on them
off Kellett Bluff
and found the
T60s and T2B
milling. They later made a kill off north Kellett Bluff before heading
east into Spieden Channel
. Then they went around Sentinel Island, around the west tip of Spieden Island and we left them at
1445
heading east in New Channel on the
north side of Spieden Island
. They may have been making another kill as we were leaving the area. Other boats were still with them after we left. -Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research

a report of
orcas at the north tip of Anderson Island
heading from west to east. I wonder if these are the same ones from Fox Island earlier?? -Kim Merriman

. RP claimed to have a calf with them. -Clare Honn
