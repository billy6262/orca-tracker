Orca Sightings for January 14, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
210 pm -
on the south side of
Ketron
been viewing them (
orcas
) from the boardwalk of
Nisqually Wildlife refuge
for about 30 mins. Around
140pm
I watched orcas on the south side of
Ketron from Nisqually Wildlife Refuge Boardwalk
. I was very far away but they were just milling about no clear direction of travel. I watched for about 30 minutes before I had to leave. -Tracy Morris

12:45pm-
1:40pm -
Went out today while at work at
Nisqually Reach Nature Center
. I spotted the dorsal fins of the
Orcas
from inside the center and immediately told everyone around me. Daniel Hull went and got his boat and then we were off. Got some great pics of the pod today it's on our facebook now, there will be more from others that are of better quality. One large male for sure was sighted along with couple of females and at least one young calf possibly? Continued to see
orcas in the distance until ~
3:00pm
. -Betsea Antonio
