It's a girl! Orca gender identified; her mother remains a mystery. As of this afternoon,
J pod, including the J16 clan, was near Nanaimo, B.C
., and headed south toward the Washington border, according to Tom Cogan, who was in the vicinity. -Chris Dunagan

On the previous update (
January 5), J27 and the rest of
J pod were off the northwest corner of Texada Island
. They continued northwest to near Campbell River, BC, and then looped around Tuesday and yesterday in the northern Strait of Georgia before heading on a more southerly course this morning. The near real-time locations from the satellite tag allowed staff from DFO Canada to readily locate the whales yesterday and confirm that the new calf, J50, was still alive.
