Orca Sightings for January 19, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research called after accompanying
J pod +L87 down San Juan Channel and out Cattle Pass
and south a couple of miles, leaving them about

12:45
headed straight for Admiralty Inlet. Full encounter and incredible photos at the Center for Whale Research

19 January update - The transmitter on J27 switched to transmitting every other day late in the day of 17 January in order to conserve battery power. Consequently, there were no locations until late in the day on
18 January which found the whales west of the Fraser River headed south
. They continued south during the night and on the
morning of the 19th were heading down San Juan Channel
. By that afternoon they were in the middle of the eastern end of the Strait of Juan de Juca. -Map provided by NW Fisheries Science Center

Moving fast,
2-3 Orcas heading east SJI at Mineral Point
(north tip of San Juan Island)!

3:50p.m

Bill Hewitt of San Juan Island passed along this sighting to me from this morning: he saw whales near
Cape San Juan in San Juan Channel
and they eventually went south. Josh McInnes has identified them as the
T86As and likely T90s
. -Monika Wieland for Bill Hewitt

Arrived at my fishing spot to immediately see
T137
again. They will be visible from
Solo Point or Anderson Island Ferry Lanes
from now 1114 until they go somewhere else. Several Kayakers got showered with their cameras from this big guy. -Chris Dearth

I am assuming this is the same animal [a gray whale] we saw at
Point Wilson about 2pm
. It looked fairly small, but seemed to be traveling well. It hung out in the current around Point Wilson for 30+ min too, so maybe it just likes current? -Chrissy McLean
*

1:30 -
Erica at the Port Townsend Marine Science Center called to report
a gray whale passing the Center
about 100 yards offshore,
heading north
toward Pt. Wilson.
*
Greg Graves called to report seeing
a gray whale between
9:45 and 11 am, in Portage Canal
, which is a narrow waterway, about 100 yards wide,
between Port Townsend Bay and Oak Bay at the south end of Marrowstone Island
. The whale was almost stationary for over an hour despite a strong current. No direction of travel was known.
