Orca Sightings for January 20, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
An update from tagged killer whale
J27
: After what appeared to be a direct run for Puget Sound by J27 on the last update (19 January), J pod were nowhere to be found in Puget Sound the next day. The mystery was solved when the tag fired up late yesterday (20 January) after its day off duty and showed that the whales had made a 90 degree turn to the right and headed out to the ocean off
the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. As of this afternoon they had moved back into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Map courtesy of NMFS' Northwest Fisheries Science Center

3:15 PM - Small single whale in Hood Canal
today, spotted near
Scenic Beach park in Seabeck
headed south. Not an Orca but
possibly a Grey or Humpback?
Traveling fast with three or four breaths, fluke, dive and some breaching. Small boat in pursuit at a respectful distance. -Kathy Cole
