Kristen reported seeing
a single male orca from Lincoln Park,
West Seattle, in mid-channel but seemed to be headed south and toward the Seattle side.
*
At about
10:20 am five orca, including at least one a large male, passed the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal headed south
. I was monitoring from the Vashon Ferry Terminal. Project marine mammal observers also spotted them from 2 ferries serving the route. They were traveling quickly to the south, closer to the east side of the Sound. All pile driving was suspended until the orca left the monitoring area, which is 3.4 miles from the Vashon terminal. I first observed the whales about
9:45 north of Alki Point, and they were about 2 miles south of Fauntleroy by
10:35. -Burt Miller, WSF
