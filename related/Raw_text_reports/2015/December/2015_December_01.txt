Orca Sightings for December 1, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ivan called Dave at home in the AM to say he had whales in
San Juan Channel
headed toward Spieden Channel. Dave and Giles headed to Snug Harbor and left aboard Orca at 0930. Ivan stayed with the whales until Orca arrived on scene at
0944 a couple hundred yards south of Battleship Rock
. Ken and Heather came out in Chimo a little later. The whales were in three groups heading south with the
K13's trailing the J14's, J2, and L87
by about a hundred yards. The
J16's and J19's were a couple hundred yards offshore
of the others in a loose group.
J39
was traveling with the J16's and J19's but we did not see any others of the J11's, J17's, or J22's.... See the full CWR encounter #99 report.

December 1 & 2 Noon - We saw orcas at Falcon Cove Beach, Clatsop County, Oregon
. First time, Dec 1: large rafts of sea lions jugging (floating with flippers in the air) just beyond the breakers, perhaps 50 sea lions. Suddenly, they started porpoising, surfing the waves, and moving fast. For a short moment, we thought they were playing, but then saw 2 small spouts among them -- whales! Sea lions kept scattering, many coming into the breakers closer to shore. By then, we guessed killer whales though we've never seen them here before. Never saw any dorsal fins. Watched the action for +- 10 minutes. Finally they all moved north of the bird rocks and we lost our view. The next day, Dec 2, we were watching the rafts of sea lions again. This time we saw the dorsal fins and spouts as sea lions dashed in all directions. Had them in sight for about 5 minutes. The orcas moved south. We saw 2 females for sure (side by side, curved fins) and 2 small spouts farther out which we assumed were also orcas. Grays have been moving through but their spouts are bigger. -Viviane Simon-Brown

Sarah Frey called in a report of
at least two humpbacks, first at Apple Tree Pt. just north of the Kingston ferry at
10:30 am; then by
11:30 am further north
, off SW Whidbey Island across from Point No Point, tail lobbing and spouting.
