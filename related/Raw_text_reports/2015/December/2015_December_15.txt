Just heard from WA State Ferries that a pod of about
7 - 10 orcas
was sighted off the
Fauntleroy ferry dock at 1 pm
heading south; then at about

1:30
they headed north. We talked to the Monitors at the Vashon ferry dock construction site and they had already paused their operations.
(All
December 15th sightings reports are unconfirmed as to which type, seems likely J pod continued south and stayed overnight -ALB)
