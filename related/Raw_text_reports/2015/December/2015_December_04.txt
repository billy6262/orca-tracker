Orca Sightings for December 4, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
L103 and new calf L123 in the Juan de Fuca Strait south of Sooke, BC
. -Mark Malleson, CWR
*
Report relayed from Ken Balcomb, of
most of the Southern Residents, except the L12's, off Sooke in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Very spread out and trending west out to sea.
*
J, K, & L were off Sooke B.C. all day
today. Always amazing to see! Out watching Humpback whales we get a tip of Orca near Sooke, we were the first to find
over 60 heading west from Race Rocks
WOW! What an amazing day on the water, calm, warm & Killer Whales everywhere. ( note added by Paul Dec 5th after announcement of L123: Thanks to Mark Malleson for helping us find and learn of the new born calf L123 - Mother L103 according to the Center for Whale Research. ) -Paul Pudwell

Noon -
Not just one, not just
two, but three humpback blows from three whales, SE of Point No Point
. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

9:44 a.m. -
blows seem to indicate turned north in the same area - milling/feeding

9:28 a.m. -
whale blows
Kitsap side near Elgon
appears to be heading south. Type unknown at this sighting. Tall blows, my guess would be
humpback
. Right off shore from the huge boulder off Pilot point (just north of Eglon).
