Orca Sightings for December 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:01 p.m. - Resident orca S4 calls (J pod) on OrcaSound hydrophone.
A few loud vocals followed my a few minutes of quiet, then again distant S4 calls for 2-3 minutes with some echolocation. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

(Below is an excerpt from the Center for Whale Research Encounter 101 Report confirming the new calf designated J54)
....Jeanne pointed Dave in the right direction to
J28 and the calf
and he found them with little problem at
1110 off Smallpox Bay. J28, her new calf J54, and J46
traveled as a threesome for the rest of the encounter. They were surfacing erratically and taking long dives so obtaining good photographs was difficult to say the least. The calf appeared to be in good health and not once during the long dives did J54 surface early before the other two like young calves often will. The J28's moved out to mid-strait while in front of Andrews Bay but moved back inshore by the time they made it to Kellett Bluff....
