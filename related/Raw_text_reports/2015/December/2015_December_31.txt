Orca Sightings for December 31, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Last night (
December 31st) we sat out by the water in the darkness
Roberts Creek BC
listening to the Seal Lions on White Islet being very vocal. We started hearing a strange noise coming closer and then we realized it was
3 or 4 whales spouting
. They swam by and kept going down towards Gibsons/ Vancouver. We were under the impression that the whales had migrated from this area for the season? Do they usually stick around the southern Georgia Strait in the winter? This is our first winter out here and we were very excited and surprised! It sounded to me like orcas from what I've experienced before but I can't really say for sure. The breathing was quick and intense and they seemed to be swimming close together. They were always swimming fairly quick it seemed. Unfortunately we couldn't see them at all bit it was still pretty magical. -Brandi Fitzpatrick
*
Noon - Orca activity off Driftwood Beach, Oregon
: I saw
a large # of almost simultaneous blows
in a fairly tight group about
3-4 m off shore
. We are at about 250' elevation. About 10min or so later I saw them again further out and again later on even further, maybe 10mile? I could not make out what prey they were after as my 10x binocs did not allow detail, but I did see reflections off the backs of some. It was amazing. -Garry Helms
