Orca Sightings for December 20, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Excerpt from Center for Whale Research Encounter 102...Jane Cogan and Jeanne Hyde called Dave at home to relay a report of
killer whales being spotted in San Juan Channel
. Dave headed over to CWR and then to Snug Harbor and left aboard Orca at 0940...Orca finally arrived on scene at 1250 about
a mile southwest of the Salmon Bank
buoy. Morning Star, who had stayed with the whales and helped Orca get there, reported that all the whales had been together in one group and had recently split up into several groups as they headed slowly southwest. The groups were spread out north to south with the largest group including the
J11's, J14's, J19's, J22's, and the J35's. J2 and L87 and the rest of the J17's had disappeared to the south
somewhere while the
J16's were somewhere to the northwest

at least two humpback whales between Edmonds and Possession Point
