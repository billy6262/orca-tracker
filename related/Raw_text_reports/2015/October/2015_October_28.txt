North central Puget Sound - 2 humpback adults blowing and diving at Point No Point
tonight from
3:55 until dusk. I was out walking at Point No Point today from
3:55pm until after
5:00pm and saw two large adult Humpbacks feeding together. They were blowing and diving fairly shallow which gave me the opportunity to see most of their bodies. Wow! What a show! They were moving south of the lighthouse, across in front of the lighthouse and over to Norwegian Point and back again. A few times they were quite close to the beach because the tide was in. Amazingly, beautiful animals! -Jann Clare
