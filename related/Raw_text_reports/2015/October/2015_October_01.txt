Orca Sightings for October 1, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went up to
Sooke B.C.
as a superpod was reported, when we arrived, the fog was so thick we could barely see anything! When out of the fog we were surrounded by appx. 10 resident orcas, most of which
looked like L's
including
L25 Ocean Sun
and the two L babies!... -Janine Harles

12:46 p.m. - J,K, & L Pod off Sooke, B.C
. right now! -Paul Pudwell

I was heading north
toward Mukilteo from Possession Bar
this evening and passed
3 Orcas heading South
. Looked like an adult and 2 juveniles. -Ron Reeder
*

12:30 p.m. - I watched 4 orcas
, 3 adults and one younger, in
Port Susan Bay
from my Port Susan Terrace home. They traveled East 100 yards off shore for about 30 mins. -Melanie Serroels
*

12:30 p.m. -
We had a huge treat at lunch today when a
small group of orcas swam by our home at Port Susan
Terrace beach on Camano Island. There were probably three adults and one juvenile. They hung around for about 30 minutes. They were closely followed by a group of porpoises. How's that for dessert? -Bob and Mary Pelland
(Looks like
T137A
. Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research)

12:30 pm -
Just saw two
Orcas off east shore of Camano Island in Port Susan Bay
. It Looked like one was a calf. There were
3 orcas
and they were heading south toward Everett. It was so cool seeing these from our deck. -Cindy Stulken
*
The
Mukilteo Clinton ferry
reported seeing the
orcas
again, on the
north side of the ferry at around
11:30 am
- then a

12:30 report of orcas in Port Susan
.

My name is David Long. I am a surfer, and I surf at
Ocean Beach San Francisco
. I saw
two Orcas side by side at Ocean beach, Sloat Ave
., at about
9 am
on Thursday
October 1 , 2015. Fins fully exposed, white on the side, traveling north. -David long

3:05 p.m. -beautiful humpback just south of Point No Point
, Kitsap. -Janine Harles
(This whale was photographed on 9/26 & 9/28 in this same general area, see our Sept 28th Sightings Report)
*

5:22 p.m. - humpback blow close to Kitsap side
several miles
south of Pt no Pt
- directly west of north Edmonds. Just saw a fluke and dive, looks heading more to shoreline

4:08 p.m. -
I'm thinking it might be a humpback mom with calf

12:25 pm -
huge splash from what I believe had to be a humpback breach. Mid channel
east of Point No Point
& south of Scatchet Head. In line between Double Bluff and north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson
*
Got word of some apparent
humpbacks seen between the Edmonds and Point No Point this AM
by birders. "I saw quite a few blows and several backs of what looked like Humpbacks in a 30 second period about
8:30am this morning from the pier. The quick frequency of the blows made me think I was seeing at least two whales. They were far enough that I could only see the very top of their backs and their blows though so hard to know." The direction they said would put them between PNP and Whidbey. -Josh Adams
