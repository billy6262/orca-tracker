Orca Sightings for October 27, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
SUCCESS!
Bigg's killer whale in Case Inlet.
After four hours, I was on my way home and just happened to look right as I made the final stretch into
Pierce County along Case Inlet
and boom! I caught a dorsal out of the corner of my eye. I did a u-turn and parked on the side of the road, then ran up to a guy with a waterfront house and asked if I could use his yard to take pictures. He was very cool about it, and even went to look at them from his deck. I was treated to a twilight show by a male, female, and a baby.
