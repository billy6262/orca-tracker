My friend Scott just called to tell me the
Humpback is off Manchester
( off Olympiad Dr. Between Southworth & Harper) still, and that he
thinks there are 3 of them
today. He is seeing blows too far apart to be the same Whale. I asked if he thought the others could be the dolphins, and he said he doesn't think so. Closer to the Kitsap side but heading towards Blake Island. -Melissa Bird
