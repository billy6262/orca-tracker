Orca Sightings for October 7, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:40 p.m. -
Five Star's vessel Supercat found the
Resident Orcas coming in from the west at Race Rocks
this afternoon at about 2.40pm. Many Orcas in amongst the rain,
possibly all 3 pods heading east.
-Andrew Lees

9:30 am -
John Rogstad from WA State Ferries relayed a report of
a male orca in San Juan Channel
heading west. Not sure where in San Juan Channel but probably near Friday Harbor, headed toward Spieden Channel.
*
Finally got to see this
fin whale
. First near
Hein Bank about
1:00 p.m.
Then again about 4
:00 p.m. near McArthur Bank
in the vicinity of some huge bait balls. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

5:40 p.m. - There is at least 4 humpbacks
, as I cannot see SE of Scatchet Head from my home, so my 3 plus at least 1 of Stu's.

5:10 p.m. - saw three humpbacks NW of Edmonds
. One is just a couple of miles north of the ferry and the other two 3-4 miles away. Binocs will be needed. From Sunset Ave N, line of sight is Double Bluff for one of the farther ones and scan partway to the left for the other two. -Sherman Page
*

5:36 p.m. -
My guess is that there is overlap. The two I was watching traveled from
southeast Point No Point
to closer to south Whidbey and now one heading east
towards Possession Point
last I saw it.

5:15 p.m. -
did spot a humpback south east of
Scatchet head
heading more towards Possession Point.

4:12-
4:16 p.m.-
huge breaching just south east of
Point No Point
and then closer to
Kitsap - two humpbacks
- at least a half dozen breaches! -Stu Davidson
*

4:00 p.m. - south tip of Whidbey
, closer to Edmonds side, I am seeing
humpback
spouting with what I think are a group of orcas breaching and lots of tail slapping around the
humpback
. Not sure if I am interpreting this right. (no one else reported seeing orcas to confirm type of cetaceans-ALB) Lots of unusual looking activity. I have only seen humpbacks since then. The smaller cetaceans disappeared pretty quickly. Right now there are a couple humpbacks swimming off of Eglon, south of the boat ramp. -Rebecca French Gerke
