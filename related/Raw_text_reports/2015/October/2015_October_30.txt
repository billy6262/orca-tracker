============================================================

Entry 1:
Humpback in Puget Sound. Off Point No Point
, Hansville, WA. -Steve Smith
*

12:30 p.m. - central Puget Sound
- I saw a single humpback just
south of Southworh ferry
... Very near shore heading northbound. Went to Harper pier hoping to see it near Blake Island, but never saw it again. Lots of wind waves made for difficult viewing. -Noreen Ferris
*

12:07 p.m. - north Puget Sound - Humpback in Saratoga Passage
, mid channel, in front of Woodland Beach, Camano Island. Appeared to be heading south. Saw 4 blows, saw back and tail when he dove. Additional blows suggest several whales. -Krista Paulino
*

11:27 a.m. - north Puget Sound - humpback whale
appears to be sleeping at the surface. I can see its back but not doing anything but floating in one spot.
East of Point No Point
and east of shipping lanes. As seen from north Edmonds. -Stu Davidson
