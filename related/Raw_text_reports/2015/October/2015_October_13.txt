Orca Sightings for October 13, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
"Tres Generations"
L047, L091 and L122 south west past Hein Bank
. -Mark Malleson
*
The newest orca kiddo to the Southern Residents,
L122 with mom L91
. He seemed to have lots of energy today! Those are both a gilnet & a purse seiner net in the background. There was lots of fishing going on in the whale's primary forage habitat off the west side of San Juan Island. I am always amazed at how effortless the whales navigate the lay of the nets.
K35 "Sonata"
does a half breach with San Juan Island in the background. I haven't seen
J2 "Granny"
for a while, but here she is! An absolutely GORGEOUS day on the water today! It's October right?!? Beautiful encounter with some
Js, Ks, and Ls
! -Traci Walter

J Pod

those at
Scatchet Head
