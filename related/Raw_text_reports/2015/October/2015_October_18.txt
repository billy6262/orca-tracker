Orca Sightings for October 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
...We found
members of J, K and L pods in bound/foraging south of Cape Mudge lighthouse
(north end of Georgia St, south end of Johnstone St.) by approximately 2 miles. Once on scene, we started scanning and as far as 4 miles away we were seeing dorsal fins! In 20 years of operating I have never witnessed all 3 pods together, nor have I ever seen them come up this way ALL together, usually its smaller sub pods.

. There were many chum salmon showing on the surface, lots of surface foraging behavior from the orcas. About 15 animals shot off and surfed towards the cape at 15 knots or more. We left the pods foraging together on Chum salmon not 2 miles south of Cape Mudge @ 1800hrs! Janeen Templeman and I had a once in a lifetime encounter! -Nick Templeman

We found a mom (left) and calf (right)
humpback pair in Rosario Strait
and later found a pod of Dall's porpoise. The calf tail slapped several times, and as if in response, mom threw her tail in the air. It was chilly and gray, but the water was unbelievably flat calm. -Rachel Haight
