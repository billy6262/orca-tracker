Multiple pod calls audbile. Last night Barbara and David heard and identified
southern resident orcas in Johnstone Strait
. They had been seen earlier in the afternoon near Ripple Point making their way north. Then this afternoon Jared called to say the southern residents were off Donegal Head. Very soon after we heard calls! But the calls were northern G clan calls, specifically I31/I11 type calls!!! What the??? We told Jared. He said "seriously?" because he was looking at southern residents clustered together behind a tug heading into Blackfish Sound. We could hear the southerns but the G clan calls sounded closer. Jared then reported that there was a group close to Flower Island. Was this the G clan group? They then came into view. Jared followed this group in and identified them as
a mix of I31s and I11s. (northern G clan orcas)
As he followed this group he watch the southern residents move close to Burnt Point on the Hanson Island side and soon they were in our view. There were a lot of southern residents!!!! The northerns chose to stay on the far shore almost parallel to the southerns who moved to mid channel. The vocals dropped off. The groups progressed through the Pass and out of view. Whew! So beautiful! So unusual, once in a lifetime! But it was not all yet over. We had seen another group over on the far shore and eventually this group made their way into Blackney well after the others. It turned out to be the
A34s with A46!
. There was just enough light to see them and Jared came back to do a quick confirmation before heading home. Southern and northern residents are not known to mix and this was a close. So amazing, we are all blown away and thankful too. -Helena & Paul

This evening I was paddle boarding near
Blake Island
when an
Orca
came fishing nearby. The whale stayed in the harbor for nearly an hour. It was magical. I also heard that there was a grey whale in the same area this morning. She was alone. She was large. When she breathed it sounded like a freight train. She was diving, swimming back and forth, and slapping her tail. At first she was in the ferry lane then eventually swam toward Manchester/Bainbridge. A guy on a sail boat said the whale was chasing Coho Salmon in the ferry lane. He saw her too. When the whale returned 30~40 minutes later a fisherman was witnessing her as well. A woman and her son on shore in South worth could see her too. She was Definitely larger than a porpoise or dolphin...it was a magnificent whale. I am so happy and honored to have seen her. -Gina O'Brien
