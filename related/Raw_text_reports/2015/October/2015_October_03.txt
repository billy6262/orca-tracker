Kristin Bell called to report watching
a humpback off Point No Point
surfacing and tail lobbing as it appeared to be swimming east.
*

4:40 p.m. -
They surfaced again, pretty much same area. Straight out from
Haines
, appear to be headed north. My guess is less than a mile off the
Edmonds
side.
Heading N or NW
. Waiting for them to surface again.

4:30 p.m. -
Just saw
two humpbacks off Haines Wharf
(I think that's what it's called) in
Edmonds
. Saw several sprays, then two flukes so presumably down for a longer dive. Edmonds side, naked eye. -Kristin Kreifels
*

10:00 a.m. -
Marilyn and a friend just called from
Eglon
to say they're watching the
humpback (1 or 2??)
from their house about 1-1/2 miles south of the Eglon boat launch, gradually heading north.-James DeRoy
*

8:30 a.m. - The Humpback is back at Point No Poin
t this morning! Or maybe she never left? Just South of the point- no apparent direction. She looked to be foraging. Kitsap side. -Elyse Margaret
*

4:38 p.m. -
Ok, this is cool. We just had
a large group of LAGS (Pacific white-sided dolphins)
go porpoising south off of the west side. How fun! (Between Lime Kiln and False Bay). -Sandy Buckley

Transient Killer Whales in Sooke Harbour & Basin tonight, T11A Rainy & T11 Wakana
hunting and exploring the inner harbour and basin. This is a rare, wonderful, special day! Sooke Basin to the end of Whiffin Spit. WOW! -Paul Pudwell

This is the
fin whale
that's been hanging around
south of Lopez Island for the past few weeks
. I finally saw it today. Fin whales are the 2nd largest animal on earth behind the blue whale. This is the first time a fin has been seen in this area for at least 10 yrs. I've heard contradicting things about it and have been wanting to get a look. Fins are seen routinely in Southern Ca. and I've seen many. They are also an animal we had to know to complete naturalist training in Ca. Although they can reach 75-80 feet in length I would estimate this animal at 50-55 feet. Either a sub-adult or just a smallish adult. It appears to be healthy and was behaving normally, maintaining a rhythmic sequence of 8 minute long dives with 3 breaths on the surface in between. Based on the bowel movement it had while we watched it seems to be feeding just fine. The whale has penella balaenopterae pits but so far I have not seen any penella remaining attached. They are a warm water parasitic copepod and would likely detach in the cold water here. Good to see this whale. I hope it hangs around for awhile. The common murres on the other side of the whale are about 1 foot long and give some size perspective. -James Grehsam
