10:09 p.m. -
It's a bit odd but on
Camano at northern end of Mabana
, since 7 pm I've heard blows and tail slaps. Too dark to see much so no idea what sort of whale it is and I think maybe 2 but not 100% sure it is 2. Definitely whale though. Very close to shore. Its been here for almost 3 hours. Too bad we don't have a full moon. -Sally Olin

Humpbacks (
at least 4 different humpbacks
at once) have been active last couple days off
Whidbey Island
