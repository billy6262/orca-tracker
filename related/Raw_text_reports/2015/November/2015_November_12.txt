============================================================

Entry 1:
4:00 p.m. - Orcas off President Point, heading south
, on the Kitsap side. -Joanne Graves

3:36 p.m. -
I just saw a pod of orcas from the Edmonds ferry a couple hundred yards from the
Edmonds dock
. They didn't really seem to be moving in any direction. The first one that I saw was a calf on the port side only about 20 yds from the ferry. -Brandon Fleck

We spotted some
orcas from

10:00-
10:30am
this morning on the
west side of Lummi Island
(out in the pass between Lummi and Clark, but closer to us on Lummi). They were a ways out and it is very windy so there were a lot of white caps. ...they were far out, at least 2 smaller ones that seemed to be calves, and several adults (at the very least 2, but I'd guess
more like 4 or 5. At least one adult male
. They appeared to be playing and maybe feeding. They were jumping a lot and sort of circling around a relatively small area right on the line (either the tide line or where the currents were meeting). They also appeared once or twice to either be dragging/tossing something through the surface of the water, or sort of jolting quickly along the surface (again, hard to discern what we were seeing there given the distance and the waves). from what I could tell they were moving south/southwest, since they seemed to drift a little that way over the course of the 20-30 minutes I was watching. The last one we saw was significantly to the left (aka south), although after that I didn't see any of them again in either direction. -Kelsey McLane

Tacoma - The
whale
was seen at

11:15
only about 200ft from shore, if that. It was in the same area as the eider. No large dorsal fin seen and it only surfaced twice. No blowing seen. It appeared grayish with white spots (though these could be due to barnacles) and appeared maybe 30 to 40 feet in length. Any whale in Tacoma is a pretty good find. (This is the same
gray
as in our
November 10th report and Kim Merriman's report below on the 11th - ALB) -Christopher Clark, Sumner, WA
