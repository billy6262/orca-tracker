Orca Sightings for November 8, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just got a report from a friend that we have
whales near the Vashon Ferry at
8:45
. No clear direction - just back and forth - which is common for that area. 2nd report as well from the same time. Both said about 5 and did not see big males. Visibility was not great to the south with fog and the squall. (several experienced spotters attempted to find this pod with no success). -Amy Carey

I was at Old Ferry Landing in
Gig Harbor
this afternoon and watched the
gray whale

2:40 p.m. -
Too far north to be seen from the

Gig Harbor
side. Definitely a heart-shaped blow like a
gray whale
. -Jill Clogston

1:37 p.m. -
Well, our sneaky gray has given us the slip just north of the
Narrows Bridge
, slightly inside the west tower. Perhaps he's resting at the surface? We'll leave him at peace. Thankful to have been able to spend time with him. Thanks Orca Network for answering our questions and humoring us newbies on "The Whippoorwill".

11:56 a.m. -
We're comfortable reporting this as a
gray whale
, unable to determine size, meandering in a north easterly direction just south of the
Narrows Bridge
.

With think it's actually a
gray
, traveling NE, approx 2 kts through the water, near the
Narrows
. -Tyler Fisher

Noon
- Hello, While riding my bicycle across the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge
, I happen to see this
Gray whale surfing near the Tacoma Narrows Bridge
, agitating the water. It surfaced at least three times and submerged, but shallow enough that I could still see where it was and where it was going. I was able to get these pictures, before it fluked, and disappeared as a boat was coming at speed, not at it, just close by. If it came back up, it would have been under the bridge and out of my sight. -Ralph Reed

We sighted
two humpbacks
Sunday around dusk at
Point No Point Lighthouse
. The whales were close into shore and startled a fisherman. They weren't diving deep as they rounded the point, so only the dorsal fins and backs were visible. We were delighted to see these big guys again! -Carol Keathley
