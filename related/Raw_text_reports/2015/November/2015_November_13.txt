Sounds like the
SRKWs on PT hydro
. Started hearing them a few minutes ago. Faint, heard J pod. -Connie Bickerton
*

4:20 p.m. -
they are booking it! Got to
Shilshole/Golden Garden
s about
4pm
and they were already here, due west. They are clearing Meadow point about now. Lost sight in yet another bank of rain. A bit spread out but close in proximity to one another. Finished out the day watching with Bri Wilson who has trekked along with them all day as well! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

YES! YAY! We see them! They are surfing the wake of the tug boat. Still heading north. (exciting times for her, this was her first time seeing orcas). -Danette Walker

We received a report from Loren of
a pod of ~10 orcas off Redondo Beach
about 100 yards off the beach at about 3 pm. He said at first they were spread out, then they all collected in a really tight pod of 7 or 8 fins, and stayed that way for 20 - 25 minutes, then headed south toward Tacoma. (We found this report late in the day. Coupled with the WSF report below of southbound orcas off south end of Bainbridge, it indicates the pods split at some point - ALB)
*

2:20 p.m. -
Marie at Washington State Ferries called again, with a report from a Captain of
3 orcas SOUTHBOUND in shipping lanes off Restoration Point
.
*

ON north side of
Alki
saw one female cleared the Alki side of yellow buoy that is
between Alki and Restoration Point
, Bainbridge. Not sure if leader, seas are very rough, not seeing others.

LOL...thru the wind and sideways rain, found one large male approx.
1 mile off southside of Alki Point
moving steadily northbound in white-cappy seas.

11:02 a.m. -
They turned , now headed northbound from
Point Robinson
. -Amy Carey
*
The best part about today's visit from
Jpod
was not that they came close, or breached a bunch, but they were foraging. I could see them chasing fish and really moving around to get food. That warms my heart the most. Eat up sweet orcas. I hope there is many more abundant meals in your future. Southern Residents visited
Vashon Island
today, and with the brisk winds and rainy squalls, the babies seemed to be popping out of the sound like popcorn. -Kelly Keenan
