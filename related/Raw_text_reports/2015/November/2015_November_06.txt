============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod passing Point Robinson
southbound in perfect conditions and brilliant sunlight. -Gayle Swigart
*
J pod southbound Puget Sound near Seattle
: Tweet from WSF of
orcas seen from the Bainbridge/Seattle ferry
no location or direction.
*
At

9:43 a.m.
we received a confirmed sighting from Renee Beitzell aboard the Chilkat (who was taking children on a field trip of sorts) that
J pod was straight out from Vashon ferry terminal
heading south in several groups spread out. J pod continued south around Vashon and north in Colvos.
*
Meanwhile... K pod was southbound at the north end of Admiralty Inlet. First report at

9:02 a.m.
from Warren Griffith: On Kennewick ferry headed to Port Townsend, passed
pod of Orcas, 5 or 6 with a calf!
Heading south. Then Orca Network volunteers, Rachel Haight and Sandra Pollard took off scouting and found
K pod
. We caught sight of them
a bit south of Bush Point
. Ks continued south and were last seen before dark around the Port Madison area. Somewhere along the shores of central Puget Sound the two pods will meet...
*
Friday morning at
1 am
we heard a pod of whales, likely orcas, as they passed by just
south of Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, heading south. We started hearing a few distant blows, then they came closer and before long there were MANY blows, sounded like a fairly large pod going by, then a few more scattered blows. Hopefully more Southern Resident orcas in Puget Sound on Friday! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

K pod
southbound Admiralty Inlet. Spent most of the morning freezing at
Bush Pt
. A group of whales passed by more mid channel, doing some fishing and spyhopping as they went along. After they had passed,
K33 Tika and his mom K22 Sekiu
came passing by a bit closer to shore. I featured a sequence of Tika as he approached Bush Pt and some other sights of the morning. A pod of harbor porpoise as well as a Steller sea lion popped up off shore while watching the orcas swim by. Just minutes later, the orca plane flew overhead, though it was probably too choppy for them to spot whales. There was also a steady line of sailboats headed out on this cold, windy day. They provided a bit of color among the shades of grey. Another day in the life on Whidbey. -Rachel Haight
