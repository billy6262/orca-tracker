Orca Sightings for November 23, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
I love heading out out with a full boat, and then finding Orcas! In this case, it was
a single Orca, T77A
. Such good news, since the last time he was seen, he was tangled in some line and a float. NOT TODAY! SWIMMING FREE! Notice the identifying notches in the dorsal fin!
Near D'Arcy Island, BC

12:25 p.m. - Penn Cove -
Jenny, at the Mosquito Fleet restaurant in
Coupeville
, along with several customers, saw a whale surface a few hundred yards from shore, between the beach and the dock at the end of the Coupeville Wharf. From the description it
sounds like a gray whale
. It was heading east, out of Penn Cove.
