============================================================

Entry 1:
T49A4 from our most recent encounter...the T68C's (4 whales) and T68B2

East Point/lower Georgia Strait

Transient Killer whales feed on marine mammals and don't often get the opportunity to "let loose". The noise they make from having a bit of fun can make their presence know to their prey. So when they do have a bit of fun, they give it their best and have lot of fun all at once. We just happened to be there at the time when things got quite amazing. 4 different family groups were together and were socializing like crazy! We were able to put the hydrophone down too and heard incredible vocals as well! Truly an amazing encounter on a beautiful November day! The 4 family groups were the
T049A's T123's T68B's T68C

"There were somewhere around
10 Biggs Killer Whales between Patos Island and East Point on Saturna Island
, and they were being so social it was amazing! Breaching over and over, tail lobbing and slapping, feeding, spy-hopping, and generally looking like a bunch of very happy WILD orcas!" -Chris Teren

12:35 p.m. - Olympia - Gray whale.
Confirmed. Headed east across Budd Inlet into Eld Inlet right at my house. Then it turned north, very close to shore and is still heading north, toward Hunter Point and Squaxin Island.
Morning - Neighbors to the south of me called at

8:00
and said a whale had surfaced three times heading north. I ran to the deck to see if I could see it. All I saw were sea lions. But 10 minutes later, across the span of water, I saw what I believe was a large blow! A single one. Heading south into
Budd Inlet
. Then the sunlight was on the water, blinding me. Have not seen anything since. Still on the lookout. If it was/is a whale, and I can confirm, I'll let you know. (This is the same gray as in our
November 10th report - ALB) -Kim Merriman
