Orca Sightings for August 6, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We went out with the mission of checking up on
J39
who was seen earlier this week with a fishing lure hanging out of his mouth. As of yesterday we were able to determine that
his new found accessory was no longer attached
. Whether he swallowed it or it fell out on it's own, we may never know. He appeared fine yesterday, and was behaving normally. -Center For Whale Research

9:46 pm - now Lime Kiln
...echo and faint S4 calls, getting louder.

9:20 pm -
Just turned my volume back on...

We met up with whales between
Hannah Heights and Pile Point at about
4:15 PM
. Turns out
all of Js and Ks were in Haro Strait
, and we hung out with some of them in this same area for almost two hours. J39 seemed to be in good spirits (right), rolling around and socializing with K37 Rainshadow (left). Fingers crossed he was just messing around with the flasher and is just fine! Some did go north, as we came across a large group heading quickly north on our way back home at
Open Bay at
6:45 PM

Today, we caught up with the
whales at Bell's Beach
. We were looking all around for the whales, when suddenly we clearly heard their blows; they had surfaced behind the trees out of sight. We counted
at least 8
headed north. We moved to
Fox Spit
and saw a group headed our way. As they neared, the group split up; 4 came closer to our side. My husband spotted one close to shore headed straight for us. I gave my phone to him and said if the whale comes close you need to take a video (which he did!). This group was ID'd as the
T065As
by Josh McInnes and the orca who passed close to me is
T049A2
. What a day! Surprisingly, we lost sight of them after that close encounter, and despite searching for another 5 hours, we never did find them again. Maybe they turn up in Penn Cove tomorrow? (my first encounter with the T065As was actually in Penn Cove last September). -Rachel Haight
*

1:40 pm -
I just been watching a group
4 to 6 Orcas
(possibly including one older male who was off to the side) swimming northbound in
Saratoga Passage
( we are looking east from Bells Beach on Whidbey Island). This group is now near the
state park on Camano Island
. The boats in the passage are staying away from these whales. -James Koutsky

1:25 pm -
We heard them before saw them!
At least 6, 2 juveniles
...in front of
Bells beach
northbound. -Rachel Haight

1:15 pm - pod
now moving on northbound towards
Bells Beach
...very much on Whidbey side

1:00 pm -
I have eyes on them...very close to shore in little bay north of Langley. Look to be on the hunt. they circled back in very close to shore. -Alisa, ON

Had a great day on the boat finding a Pod of
5 or 6 Orcas
!! The Orcas were spotted
south of Langley
near shore
heading northerly into Saratoga Passage
. (Several photos were sent to Dave Ellifrit of Center for Whale Research who confirms
T65A's and T49A2
were present during this encounter). -Stu Davidson
