Orca Sightings for August 19, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Later that evening,
around 6
I saw
3 orcas heading up the west side of San Juan Island
just north of
False bay
maybe 300 yards off shore (there may have been more, they were moving quickly), and saw
4 or 5 more
from
San Juan County Park
at sunset around

8:30
. -Kevin Marshall
*
Approx.

8:00 p.m.
- surprised again by the
K13s
coming northbound, all passing in front of us by
8:20 but still visible to us at
8:30, back-dropped by the setting sun.

6:00 PM -
here they come again, northbound
orcas...Ls
.

1:00 PM -
From cabin at Land Bank, surprised by southbound whales,
members of K and L pods
. They all streamed by 1/4-1/2 mile off shore, very spread out. -Alisa, ON
*
We were watching from a 200+ yard distance south of
Lime Kiln
were all of a sudden surrounded by
Orcas
. We cut our engines because it was unsafe to move. Two orcas changed paths to swim by us... maybe to show off the fish in the larger orcas mouth?...I don't have much experience with close up viewings, as you can tell from my reaction in the video (below). It really was one of the best days of my life. I would love to know who I met. -Lisa Kelly
*
I'm just returning home from a kayaking trip. I launched my boat from
Washington Park
around
12:15pm. By

12:45
I was surrounded by
at least 20 whales
...They were traveling a decent speed south, riding the ebbing current. Then, one enormous mature orca began bobbing up and down, and one very small orca jumped, followed by a number of other mature orcas jumping. Their crash on the water was heard like thunder claps up and down Rosario Straight. -Kevin Marshall

Day report: ...morning, we headed out in search of orcas. There had been a report by Lopez Island an hour before, so the search was on. We found the
T065As
tucked in shore on the west side of
Blakely Island
. They had recently made a kill as there was blood in the water. As we stopped on scene watching them, the family suddenly made a turn straight for us. They popped up right in front of the bow, one of them showing off some of their kill in its mouth right at the surface. They stayed right next to our boat for a few minutes while slowly drifting southwest. During this time, they created about 10 bubble rings beneath the surface (I have never seen this behavior, can anyone tell me how they do it? It almost looked like
T065A2
was creating them with his flukes but I couldn't tell.) That was an absolute thrilling couple of minutes. We left them as they continued traveling south down the east side of Frost Island and Lopez Island. During the afternoon trip, we caught up with them again northwest of Blakely Island, and followed them for awhile as they continued west through the San Juan Islands. It was a beautiful day where I had a lot of fun just photographing the whales. The T065As never disappoint! -Rachel Haight

6:38 p.m. - Three orcas
moving quickly, near Black Point
15 km east of Powell River, BC

orcas, probably 4 or 5
, traveling south very slowly. Spotted off
NAS Whidbey Island

just south of
Hastie Lake
boat ramp, West side of Whidbey, traveling north. -Judy Dougherty

I was out salmon fishing in front of my house in the morning when
6 transient orcas
come racing down the shoreline with the outgoing tide, headed north. It was
T37As and T124D and T124D1
. I dropped all my fishing gear and photographed the pod as they swam northward. Eventually they circled and made a kill
just north of the Coupeville/Port Townsend ferry traffic lanes
, followed by lots of celebrating! They breached, lunged, spyhopped, and tailslapped over and over before they continued northward. As they neared
Smith Island
they went on the chase again, and caught a harbor seal. I could see at least one other killer whale swimming off in the distance during my visit, but it never came close enough to the others to see exactly who it was. -Bart Rulon

, west side of Whidbey Island, mid channel, heading north. Whale watch boat is with them. -Jill Hein.

On the

Minke Whale
to me, but I only saw it briefly. -Kevin Marshall

Minke
, heading northbound in Haro Strait. See from
