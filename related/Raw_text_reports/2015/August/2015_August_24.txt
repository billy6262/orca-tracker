orca
viewing from the shore of
Galiano Island

small groups of orca
leisurely went east through
Active Pass

During the approximate month long duration of this
tag deployment
the whales spent the first
couple of weeks in northern Southeast Alaska
primarily targeting harbor porpoise and harbor seals. As they moved southward they spent time at three or possibly four Stellar sea lions rookeries. As of 24
August 2015, the
T100s
were located in the
Strait of Georgia

6:15 a.m. -
It was a calm beautiful day & I heard the sound of
whales breathing
about

6:15am from Bells Beach on Whidbey
. I spotted between
9-10 Orcas
spread out in 3 groups heading SE towards Langley. The
2 adult males & 1 adult female
stayed out in the center of the passage, while
2 adult females came in closer
, then to my delight, the 3rd grouping of 2 adult females & 2 juveniles came into the shallow for about 20 minutes or so, very close to shore seeming to be playing together, slapping their fins & tails & tightly circling together. I thought they were Biggs Transients, but not certain. It was such a treat. -Kristin Carlson

a grey whale
half way though the strait of
San Juan de Fuca
headed north. Just
past Point Wilson about 8 miles
. Smaller whale came up blew, then dove and disappeared. -Niboreel Sreyas

Another windless day and we were fortunate to find
both minke and humpback whales
- so easy to find in mirror-like sea conditions. First was a
minke feeding near Smith Island
...Continuing on, we spotted harbor porpoise, and a
nother minke when heading to Castle Rock
, where we also found eagles and harbor seals. -Jill Hein
