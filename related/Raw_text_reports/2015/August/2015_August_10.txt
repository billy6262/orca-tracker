Orca Sightings for August 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Onboard Natsilane Monday
afternoon
, many
L pod and K pod family groups
were swimming down
Rosario Strait
. The 7' flooding tide was ending, then a 1' ebbing tide made for calm easy waters. I was able to identify the large
L55 family, L92 & L90, L95 & L105 & frisky? L72
. (The Whale Museum will tell you their names) The orca were very surface active, vocalizing and chatting! We witnessed all behaviors- powerful breathing, fishing, lunging, spyhopping, breaching, tail-fluke lobbing, pectoral fin lobbing, playing, resting, and whale 'flashes' suggesting mating! These whales made an uncommon choice to follow the ferry route west between the islands, taking their time, holding the attention of awed folks from San Francisco, Mexico, and on the ferrys! A memorable day, the many orca families traveling together, hoping they were getting enough salmon, knowing these whales need our help in restoring salmon abundance for their very survival. -Caroline Armon OnBoard Tours Whales

What an amazing day, we headed out and find whales less than a half hour from port! LOTS of whales! We were so very fortunate to find many
members of all three of our Southern Resident community, J-pod, K-pod and L-pod, right beside Cypress Island in Rosario Strait
, with dead-calm conditions. Wow, whales everywhere. Some breaching, spyhopping, tail slaps, foraging with many great looks at these whales "in action". We took a break to find some harbor seals, then the whales caught up to us. We left them heading south between Cypress and Blakely Island. What an exceptional treat for our passengers, -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

I've always wanted to be out with whales with a fantastic sunset. Tonight, all the stars aligned.
Part of K Pod and part of L Pod
were hanging out
in the middle of the islands
, and after work some friends and I went out to catch up with them on our own boat. They came east and we were able to stay with them until the very last light during an incredible sunset. Such a wonderful night, I don't really have the words. -Traci Walter

...was fortunate to be on the Chelan from Friday Harbor last night (

7:45pm
,
August 10)
rounding Lopez Island
where we saw a large group of
very active orcas
. -Dan Kilmke

K22 Sekiu and and son K33 Tika
blew our minds aboard the Island Explorer 3 today in Rosario. They would continually
breach on top of a harbor porpoise
, and then lift the porpoise to the surface. And after this behavior, the porpoise would swim right next to them, seemingly unfazed. -Michael P Colahan

11:00 am -
This was from the
(almost) superpod in Rosario strait
just
south of Lawrence point
this morning. This is
K22 and K33
harassing and
eventually killed this harbour porpoise calf
. They were quite excited breaching many times including this double breach.... -Karl Topping
*
K22 and K33
were following or almost being followed by the little critter. Had to send these through. They were
on the porpoise
almost as soon as we got on scene, and last I saw were still nosing it around just before we left. -Andy Scheffler

1:55 pm - Echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone
and adult male orca in view on webcam, northbound then turned back. -Alisa, ON

...
Transients seen in the Strait of Georgia around
2:55pm
involving the very cool
T002c, T37/37B/37B1 and more
. -Karl Topping

Pod of
3 orcas at the mouth of the Columbia, ~3 miles in from the ocean
, sighted last night,
August 10th. -Marlan Zea.
