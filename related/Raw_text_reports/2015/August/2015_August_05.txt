Orca Sightings for August 5, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Danielle called at

7:25 pm -
she just saw the orcas from the
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry
, between the Clinton Ferry dock & Gedney/Hat Island, still heading north. She saw
about 3
of them, said there could be more, it was a bit choppy out there.
*

6:00 pm - Pod of orcas right in between Possession Point and the Shipwreck between Edmonds and Mukilteo!
It really caught me off guard, I was out in the boat down off shipwreck and all of the sudden a pod of them surfaced in the distance. And then they sort of hung around just sort of milling around there for probably about 15 minutes and headed north. I saw them surface one more time about halfway closer to Mukilteo and then I lost them in my sight range. -Karsten McIntosh

Day report: finally an overcast day! We had reports of orcas northbound, and southbound, so chose the southbound group, and headed towards the
west side of San Juan Island
. In slightly choppy seas, found
J-27 Blackberry
- offshore from
Pile Point
, what a treat! Just a few whales were in the area, closer to shore, we identified
J-28 Polaris, J-31 Tsuchi, and J-46 Star
, one or 2 others were too far away for ID's. Homeward bound, we checked out harbor seals with pups, a bald eagle and tons of the seabirds who are now back in the area, fun to see. A great day for all! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

My favourite shot of the day! ... surrounded by some
J's (Group A) and K's
. This was such a cool moment.
All three J pod babies
were all together playing with
J42 "Echo"
. J26 "Mike" today and
J52 and J50
playing with their aunt/sister, J42. This was right by the north arm of the Fraser River. Right outside of Vancouver. -Gary Sutton

It's been pretty rough out there lately, and I don't know how I managed to get these shots in 3-4 foot chop but here they are!
J34 Doublestuf
was very playful and breached multiple times, and
J27 Blackberry
surprised many of the boat with close passes as he foraged with no constancy! -Heather MacIntyre
