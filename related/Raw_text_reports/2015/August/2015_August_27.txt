transients

A few minutes later a group of three whales, including a calf appeared on the starboard side.

Day report- I had an amazing experience with
a transient killer whale superpod
that congregated in front of my house. The night before I was out on my own with the T37As, and the T65As at sunset approaching Smith Island from Lopez Island, so I expected they might be somewhere in northern Puget Sound the next morning. Sure enough, in the morning I spotted them swimming
southward near Lagoon Point
. Later, just
north of Bush Point the T37As and the T65As
appeared to chase and kill a few harbor porpoise (judging by the speed at which they had to chase)! The gulls were circling and the celebrating began with tons of tailslaps, spyhopps, and some breaches. Then I noticed that
T102, T100C
, and one other male swam in to join the mix and that's when the party really began!
Between Bush Point and Point no Point the killer whales put on an acrobatics clinic
, including probably 200 breaches, cartwheels, and lunges!!! In over 20 years of photographing killer whales this was the most action packed transient experience I've ever seen, without a doubt! It was so exciting that I was shaking as I took pictures, in total awe of being able to witness such amazing behavior. At Point no Point the T37As and T65As split off from the others and they swam right next to the beach to make another kill, probably a seal this time, with salmon fishermen watching from the shore. Then the breaching started up again as they continued to travel southward past PNP. As I left the scene they were spreading out and appeared to be
heading toward Edmonds
. -Bart Rulon

Several humpbacks at the mouth of the Columbia River at Hammond
