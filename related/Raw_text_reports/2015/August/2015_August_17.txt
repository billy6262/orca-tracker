============================================================

Entry 1:
3 Generations of the J17 Matriline
.
J17
Princess Angeline (1977), daughter,
J35
Tahlequah (1998), and grandson
J47
Notch (2010). Taken from shore at Land Bank in the early afternoon while watching Js and Ks travel northbound in
Haro Strait along the west side San Juan Island
. -Connie Bickerton

1:00 p.m
. northbound passby of
Js and Ks
- Taken from shore at middle
Land Bank
, west side San Juan Island. -Ed Brooks

I just got home from sunset tour with those
J's & K's
spread in family groups & a line from near land out
into Juan de Fuca
. We left them around
Eagle Cove
. Interesting there were transients out there to, nearer to Cattle Point & a group of 4 headed by Whale Rocks & Long Island, the other transients headed sw, I think. The J's & K's were chattering, so it makes me wonder & how the residents were moving in a line. -Caroline Armon
*
We left
Js and Ks
southbound off Hannah Heights around

7:15
tonight - they went up almost to
Stuart Island
before flipping. I can't believe those other Ks and Ls were MIA today! -Monika Wieland
*

5:50-
7:10 p.m. -
Earlier in the day
Js and Ks
traveled northbound up island then turned somewhere further up in
Haro Strait
. Much appreciation to the Orca Behavior Institute for having me along on the water to observe members of J and K pods as they made their way southbound along the west side of San Juan Island in the late afternoon. We spent some time traveling down island well outside of
K21, K16 and K35
who were traveling in their usual tight group. The rest of the whales were spread out traveling alone or with their families. We continued south to Hannah Heights where we found the
K12s, J16s
hugging the shoreline powering along in now sloppy seas. Saw
J34, J27, L87, J39
and others. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, ON

Spyhop during late afternoon southbound pass of
Js and Ks
at Land Bank on the west side of San Juan Island. -Connie Bickerton
*
Cappuccino (
K21
) and Sonata (
K35
) swimming side by side in
Haro Strait
off the west side of San Juan Island. Many thanks to the Orca Behavior Institute for making it possible! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Orcas
were very spread out between
Discovery Island and north San Juan Island
, they met up and spent the afternoon at
False Bay
before turning back north,
J-2 and J-14
passing closely by Lime Kiln around
4 pm
. -Ariel Yseth
*

1:50 to
2:30 p.m. - orcas in front of Lime Kiln
. I heard echolocation and a few calls on the
Lime Kiln hydrophone
, and also saw them on the webcam. They headed north, and I heard them on the
OrcaSound hydrophone
, but not well enough to identify the pod(s). Strangely, they were seemingly quiet directly in front of Lime Kiln. Perhaps it was just a hydrophone effect of the boat noise, but I don't think so. -Joshua Glant
*
...along the
west side of San Juan Island
where our Southern Resident orcas did not disappoint us. Many were traveling north along the shoreline, others further offshore.
K-21
Cappuccino,
K33, K26, J27, J34, J2, J28, L87
and many others were ID'd. Homeward bound we found bald eagles, a Tufted Puffin, and a giant bait ball with hundreds of birds with harbor seals feasting in the middle of the bait ball! A magical day for all. -Jill Hein
*
Today, we found a
minke
just outside of
Anacortes
. Next, we spotted
a pair of humpbacks south of San Juan Island
. After that, we headed north up San Juan Island and caught up with members of
J & K pod
as they continued north. A large group including
J31 Tsuchi, J19 Shachi, J27 Blackberry, J41 Eclipse, J51
passed close to the rocks at
Lime Kiln
. Beautiful day spent with friends! -Rachel Haight
*
L87, Oynx, Land Bank, Westside, San Juan Island
, WA...My day off! -James Maya
*

1:00 p.m. - From Land Bank
, watched all of
J and K
pods (minus K13s), led by
J19
, aproach and pass northbound for over an hour. Initially in small groups spread out then tail-enders grouped up, closer to us on shore. Watched as they passed the lighthouse to the north. -Alisa, ON
*
Southern Resident Killer Whales, including the
J16s, J17s, and J22s (Group B) approaching Land Bank
. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu,
*

6:40 am -
from cabin at
Land Bank
, west side San Juan Island, first spotted an adult male to the south of us with another male, 3 females and a calf milling farther south and/or off shore.
J26
came north, stalled even with us at about middle Land Bank, breached twice in front of an oncoming cabin cruiser, then continued north a bit closer to us. He then swam in wide circles several times (as if going after salmon), took some long dives, then turned and headed back south, joining up with his family (J16s), all in glassy waters of Haro Strait in the still of early morning. -Alisa, ON
*

6:30 am -
What a beautiful way to start the day! Per-sunrise with the whales at
Eagle Cove
! At least two pods! Mamas and babies closer to shore in a tight group and many whales spread out as far as my eye can see looking across the strait with purple mountains as a backdrop! Several spy hops, lots of pec slaps and tail lobbing! It looked like the babies were trying to tail lob or do headstands, tiny little tails popping up next to the adults! Whales headed north past
Eagle Point at
6:30 AM
. -Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill
*

6:00 am -
about
25 to 30 orcas
very spread out in groups of 2 and 3 going from
Eagle Point to False bay
. All had gathered slowly together by

9:00
and have come back in large, quiet
groups of 6-10 in each group
. Only three breaches in the 3 hours. -Jenny Stands Wilson
*
...we had news of
a humpback whale
by Salmon Bank and after finding him/her, we witnessed the large "hump"back and flukes several times. -Jill Hein
