Entry 1:
We received a call from Eric Hudnell , reporting a pod of
4 - 5 orcas ~5 miles offshore of Ocean Shores, WA
, sighted while he was salmon fishing. One large male,one calf and several females in the pod.

5:30-
6:30 pm -
I went whale watching off
west side San Juan Island
. We saw
J34-Double Stuff, J22-Oreo, K33-Tika, K22-Sekiu and K43-Saturna
...I believe the tall slap is Double Stuff. -Cathy Miller Scott
*

6:20 pm -
Off shore from just south of
Eagle Cove
. I've only seen
J34
, Tika (K33) so far but he's foraging and pushing offshore. It was a very nice surprise to find some residents off the west side this evening. I thought they had all gone north. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*
Perfect/peaceful night as we watched
members of J, K, and L Pod
head north and through
Active Pass, BC
with K14 (mostly submerged) with K42 and K26 (her male offspring); J14 and her daughter J37 who was traveling with her son J49; and J41 with her son, J51 bringing up the back, L55's (L82 and her son, L116 in front) traveling with L95 who was bringing up the rear. Since the orcas were resting (a behavior where they slow, group up, surface often, and alternate different 'sleeping' hemispheres in their brain), we extended our trip an hour so that we would be able to catch them going through the narrow pass... -Heather MacIntyre
