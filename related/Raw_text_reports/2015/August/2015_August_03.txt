Orca Sightings for August 3, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:22 - calls on Lime Kiln
. -Jill Clogston

I was at
Lime Kiln
and just
a few came by
, very spread out - travel with some possible foraging. They were far out and sun going down impacting ability to get good ID shots. Except the first one sure looked like Granny with dorsal notch and closed saddle. She was all by herself in front if it was her. Also bull dorsal could have been J27 based on shape. ID photos just a real challenge tonight. -Debbie Stewart

7:18 pm -
A couple of distant resident orca
calls on OrcaSound
hydrophone. -Alisa, ON

6:13 pm - Orcas passing San Juan county park
, Snug Harbor. Heading north in Haro strait. Group of 3, + possibly baby. -Tami Rainmom

7:45-
8:55 pm
and still going... Loud
calls on Lime Kiln
. Early calls sound like L pod and now later calls typical of Js and Ks. -Alisa, ON

7:47 pm - Echolocation on Lime Kiln
! -Renee Beitzel

12:45 pm - L12s

. -Monika Wieland

5:00-
7:15 pm -
We viewed
11 orcas in two different groups
. First siting was approximately 48.38.1 N, 122.39.24 W. Both pods rounded the north point of Sinclair; one group of five went straight toward the n
orthern tip of Blakely
while the other played near the marker
off of Sinclair
for about an hour (including two full breaches out of the water). This group of six then moved south along the
west coast of Cypress
chasing jumping salmon. One of these six was significantly smaller and appeared to be older calf/young juvenile. This one was separated from the rest of the pod two separate times. -Cory Marshall

Blustery Afternoon Whale Day. The sun shining and warm, yet windy with a strong 8' flooding tide made for a fun boat ride on Natsilane, through some choppy, tide ripped waters over
toward Lummi Island
. Folks from California, Finland, and Seattle were up for the adventure! Transient-Biggs, mammal eating Killer Whales,
T037A
and family were on the prowl, they may have had 2 meals- harbor seal, porpoise? Fascinating the way they were working together, coordinating direction changes, lunging, and tail fluke slapping the water. It looked like a new calf was side by side with matriarch mama T037A! (Jared Towers confirms T37A has a newer calf T37A4, see notes in our Intro/summary) -Caroline Armon, OnBoard Tours Whales

My daughter just got back from
Point No Point (Kitsap)

at least two Orca heading north
passed the lighthouse. Approximately

8:30 pm
. -Elyse Margaret
