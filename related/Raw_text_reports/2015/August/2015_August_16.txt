Orca Sightings for August 16, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
A heck of a lot of splashing going on today...Mystic Sea encountered the
K13's
along with
Crewser (L92)
in a resting line off
Henry Island
. Once they resumed traveling northward the whales quickly picked up the pace with numerous cart-wheels, tail-slaps, spy-hops and double breaches creating LOTS of noise and HUGE splashes before tucking in close to the rocks foraging for salmon. Hopefully they found plenty to maintain healthy energy levels. -Sandra Pollard Naturalist
*
K13s, L4s, L47s, L43s, and L26s
- we caught up with them offshore in the middle of
Haro
in a resting line. They woke up at Kellett and were northbound from there at

2:15 p.m
