A unique encounter between
K13
and Sailor the Dog written up by :GrindTV
"Kate and Jaycee Butler on Sunday enjoyed a magical encounter with endangered
Southern Resident killer whales
, especially an adult female who turned upside down to inspect the boaters, and even flipped water onto them with her fluke. But the real connection appears to have been with the Butlers' dog, a yellow lab named Sailor, who wagged his tail and seemed as intrigued by this strange beast in his midst as the orca seemed by his presence at the bow of the Butlers' 22-foot boat."

During our evening trip I got photos of the underside of
L121 showing that he is a boy
! Confirmed later by the Center for Whale Research. -Bart Rulon

K22 with Harbor porpoise calf
. -Jill Hein

Had a wonderful evening encounter tonight with Lolita's suspected Mother,
Ocean Sun (L25)
. She was all off on her own, the closest whale who was a little further away was
L41, Mega
. Taken 45 years and a day later than when her daughter was stolen from her. -Traci Walter
*
We had an awesome late afternoon encounter with
L119 Joy
and
L113 Cousteau
babysitting
L121
while mom Calypso was off a little ways fishing. The youngsters were playing at the surface and very active, and then did some fishing themselves before mom rejoined them. This was off the
south end of San Juan Island
. -Carrie Sapp

L85 Mystery
throwing a big cartwheel in front of the Center for Whale Research boat. Near
Cattle Point
on Sunday
evening
. -James Gresham

4:30 pm -
What wonderful whale viewing today from the shore of
Galiano Island. L pod ( I think) + ?, about 30 orcas in all
, very actively went east through
Active Pass
. Many spyhops, breaches, tail slaps and cartwheels. -Karoline Cullen
*
Orcas in Active Pass
. An excellent show today of
J and L pods shot from Galiano Island
. Our guest Kim saw them for the first time today and was very excited as you can hear! (and who wouldn't be seeing them like this for the first time!) -Gary Cullen
*
A spectacular encounter with
Southern Resident orcas today off Stuart Island Lighthouse
... On yet another glorious day of calm seas and blue skies, members of
all three pods (J, K and L)
were represented as they headed north in their family groups. We witnessed a number of natural behaviors, milling and feeding, breaching, spy-hopping and tail-slapping, against the stunning backdrop of Pacific Northwest mountain and forest scenery. With the whales having been sporadically searching for food in smaller, spread our groups, it was truly rewarding to see so many of them where they belong - together. -Sandra Pollard (Naturalist)
*
During our evening trip I got photos of the underside of
L121
showing that he is a boy! Confirmed later by the Center for Whale Research.
L121, L119, Joy, and L113 Cousteau
were all playing around with each other, chasing what looked like pink salmon, and playing with the salmon during our visit. They had salmon in their mouths, salmon on their rostrums, salmon on their dorsal finds, and salmon sandwiched in between them at times!...It was definitely a day to remember out there! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Island Explorer 3.
*

3:55 pm - L12's at Eagle Cove.
-Barbara Bender
*
Today was great! We had
members of all three Resident pods (J, K, and L)
in the Salish Sea, as well as Transient orcas. The majority of Residents
went north to the Fraser River
...K12 Sequim erupted in a full breach as she crossed Boundary Pass with the L4's...and some stayed south off the Salmon Bank area, like the L12's. L55 Nugget (1977) with her daughter, L118 Jade (2011) traveling with K12 Sequim (est. 1972) with her daughter K43 Saturna (2010). -Heather MacIntyre
*

12:30 pm - Many Js Ks Ls!
Left them northbound off
Spieden
at 1230. I heard there were still some south of LK too. -Monika Wieland
*
Lime Kiln must be a magical place where the separation between water and air thins and the orca seem to come in to check us out, as we are watching them. Sunday's
morning
pass lasted close to 2 hours as somewhere
around 65 whales passed the lighthouse
. One group of whales made several passes very close to the point where we were watching them. -Connie Bickerton
*
Suttles (J40)
was one of several whales that came in close to shore this morning, swimming back and forth in front of the
LK lighthouse
seeming to delight in the kelp and company of her kin. She was swimming with
Tahlequah (J35)
here and as she passed rolled over on her side so we could see her eye. Whether she was watching us, staring up at the sky, or doing something else entirely it was a moment that will stay with me. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

9:00-
11:00am - Echolocation and S1, S4 calls
then many calls erupted from Js, then Ks and Ls as they passed close to the rocks at
Lime Kiln
. Stunning visuals on the webcam of close passes, syphops, tail lobs.
10:00am turned on OrcaSound and began hearing faint S2iii calls. -Alisa, ON
*
Pretty awesome morning. We headed out on the water at
8:00AM and headed west into Juan de Fuca Strait. We were close to Sooke when a report by Dan and Paul Pudwell via a fisherman came in of
six orca inbound off Sooke BC
. We ended up with a sub group of
Lpod
including
L089
, Southern resident orca. They were spread out over 3 km moving at an average of 4.5 km/hr and dives lasted from 4.5 to 5.5 minutes in duration. We left them heading East at Beacher Bay. -Josh McInnes
*
Sunday evening (
7 p.m -
7:30 p.m.
) we watched
4 maybe 5 Orcas feeding and swimming along Marrowstone Island's
eastern side. As they headed past East Beach they started moving out toward the shipping channel and we watched as they continued to move toward Whidbey Island. We islanders had a phone chain going and the first call came from folks up near Nodule Point telling us the Orcas were swimming south. -Patti Plevin Ivers
*
We saw the same group of transients today- crazy that they stayed virtually in the same area for a 24 hour period! (
Haro Strait
) They must have been finding ample marine mammals to prey on. Transients included:
T002C's, T034's, T037, and T037B's
. -Heather MacIntyre

part of Finlayson Arm (west of Willis Point/Brentwood,
Victoria BC
) at about
