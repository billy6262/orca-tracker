Orca Sightings for August 25, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
...amazing calm weather continues, so off we 'sailed' towards
Hein Bank
after learning that some of our endangered Southern Resident whales were in the area. What a nice surprise to find members of
L-pod
in the area, spread out over several miles, we had wonderful views of many of them. We could ID
L-22 Spirit
and her son
L-89 Solstice
, and excited to see
L-84 Nyssa
,
L-88 Wave Walker and L108 Coho
- that's the first time I have seen these males in our area this year!! Many other whales were off in the distance but too far for identification. What a special treat - which also included harbor seals, bald eagles, harbor porpoise and a seal floating on his own personal raft! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist

Sailing east from
Boundary Pass toward Sucia Island, approximately
3:30pm
. A single
gray whale
passed us going the other way. First spotted her about 200 yards off our starboard beam. We followed her visually by tracking the spouts as she cruised past the
north shore of Orcas Island and turned south down President Channel
. Didn't expect to see a gray whale in Puget Sound this late in the summer. -Robert Williams
