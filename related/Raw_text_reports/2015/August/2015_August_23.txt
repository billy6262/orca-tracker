============================================================

Entry 1:

As always, it was a great day with the southern resident orcas; however, today we saw something very rare:
J35 Tahlequah and her son J47 Notch were babysitting little J51
for most of our afternoon trip, and during that time J35 Tahlequah brought a huge salmon over to the boys before she'd eaten it. I love how even though J51 is not her son, she still took the time to let him see, touch, and experience the salmon before prey sharing with her son J47 Notch. What a surreal experience! We also witnessed lots of breeding and social behavior between members of each pod. -Heather MacIntyre

Penn Cove

6:40 p.m. - Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey Island, Honeymoon Bay. Watched pod of
at least 5 orcas
(one small dorsal fin) for at least 20 minutes in front of
Honeymoon Bay
. Feeding, circling back and forth in one area, birds circling above. First time spotted this far into Holmes Harbor in 43 years living in this spot! Exciting. -S & W Campbell

Saratoga pod: They are east of
Long Point
now and out of the cove. (after having gone into
Penn Cove
)

1:00 p.m. - About 8 whales
passed by the
Coupeville Wharf
on their way out out of Penn Cove today. I'd been checking Penn Cove for whales all morning, and when I came back after lunch, I found them as soon as I came into view. Not a bad day! -Rachel Haight

2:30 p.m. - Admiralty Inlet - pod of orcas off Fort Worden - looks like 3 of them
. -Erin Johnson

12:36 p.m. -
I observed
6 Orcas in Penn Cove
, heading north on Sunday. It appeared to be
2 males, with 2 smaller, possibly female, and 2 babies
. They were porpoising, with no spy hops, or cartwheeling. I lost sight of them as they neared the North end of the cove, but did see 2 small whales, or dolphins, heading south shortly after. 10 minutes later, a harbor seal poked it's head up near the north east shore of Penn Cove. -Anne Tilmont

0710
hours, I observed
a small pod (2 or 3 adult orcas and 1 baby)
heading northbound at
Camano Island State park
. They were 30 yards off the boat ramp and swimming northbound with the baby by them. They got to the point just to the north of the park (close to the shore line), then they heading directly out to the middle of Saratoga passage. That's the last we observed them and what a thrill it was. -Mike Brady
