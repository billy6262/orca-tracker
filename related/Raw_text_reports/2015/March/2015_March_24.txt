Update on tagged orca
L84
...24 March update - On the previous post on 20 March, the whales were southbound about 20 km
north of Brookings, Oregon
, near the California border. Our colleague Jeff Jacobson, who is based in northern California, was able to intercept them on the water that afternoon and determine that some of L pod and and K pod were with L84. The whales continued south, reaching Cape Mendocino on the afternoon of 22 March and then turned and headed north, reaching the area near the
Rogue River at 1100
today. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

HI, just enjoyed a lovely sighting of
8 orcas at Lime Kiln
. Northbound, traveling, feeding, some breaching. -Cindy Jackson
*
First
J pod
sighting of the year (for me anyway)! So excited to have caught up with these guys on the west side of the island yesterday, especially since my last encounter with them was in October. Since then there has been the heartbreaking loss of J32 Rhapsody and her unborn calf. However there have also been the exciting events of two new babies being born. We barely caught glimpses of the tiny ones yesterday, but we did get to see
J2 Granny, L87 Onyx, The Cookie Clan, and this fellow pictured below - J26 Mike
! I didn't fire off many shots from the camera yesterday because I was so excited, but hopefully there will be many more encounters with these guys in the coming weeks and photos and stories to share. Any day spent with orcas in the wild = a very good day. -Katie Jones

Got to spend some time with
J pod
(and Big Mama the humpback, see below)... J pod was in a active mood too as they inched their way up the
West side of San Juan Island
in some pretty nice social groups. There were lots of tail slaps from
Granny J2, Samish J14, Princess Angeline J17, Shachi J19, Doublestuf J34, Tahlequah J35, Hy'shqa J37, Suttles J40, Eclipse J41, Star J46, Notch J47, and Ti'lem I'nges J49
, as well a few others. There were some breaches, inverted tail slaps, dorsal fin slaps, pec slaps, cartwheels, spy hops, aerial scans, and kelpings too. What an incredible day it was!...J50 is a goofy little thing that is really fun to watch. She was playing with
J42
yesterday and being difficult for mama
J16. J51
stayed close to
J41
and was even right in the middle of a social group. -Melisa Pinnow
