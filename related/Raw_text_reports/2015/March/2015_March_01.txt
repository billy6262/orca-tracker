Orca Sightings for March 1, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
As we followed the
T124s and T086As
. We found them around
Beaver Point Salt Spring Island in Swanson Channel heading Southeast
in a flood tide. They were moving at an average speed of 6.2 knots and covered a distance of 4.2 nm. They came into within 10m of a harbor seal but no interaction was recorded. They did short 15-20 second long dives followed by a 2-3 minute extended dive. -Josh McInnes

Humpback near Edmonds
today! -Steve Smith

3:05pm-
5:00pm -
John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research was with the
humpback in Possession Sound off of Edmonds
and obtained ID photos and a skin sample. He believes it is a
1 - 2 year old juvenile humpback
whale that looked to be engaged in feeding. We'll let you know if he is able to match this whale with any in the catalogues.

2:35pm -
We saw it
North of Edmonds ferry
, mid-channel
headed south

Haven't seen it in about an hour. I'm guessing that if it continues on its path, it should be south of
Edmonds
by now. -Charles Vendley

Whale sighting in
Hood Canal
this morning at
Ayock Point
. Very rare for us. This one had a small curved fin near the rear. Could this be a Finn whale? (Minke?) I think you are right. It was a
Minke whale
