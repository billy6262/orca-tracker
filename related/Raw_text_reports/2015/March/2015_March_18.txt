Orca Sightings for March 18, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Got to spend some time with
J pod
today!! I had never seen resident orcas swim through
Active Pass
until today and it was crazy! Granny J2 and Alki J36 in Active Pass. The orcas were very spread out as they headed up Swanson Channel but
Shachi J19, Eclipse J41, and J51
were the first to make it to the entrance of the pass. They then waited for the rest of J pod to join them. Last to arrive was Granny J2 and Onyx L87. Granny then breached and tail slapped and everyone swam into the pass together! As they traveled through the pass, many of the orcas tail and pec slapped, inverted tail slapped, spy hopped, and breached. Once they exited
Active Pass
, the orcas calmed down, spread way out again, and aimed for northern Georgia Strait. What an amazing day!!! -Melisa Pinnow
