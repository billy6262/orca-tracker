heading into Discovery Bay

9:11am -
I'm currently working on the Victoria Clipper 4. The wheelhouse crew just spotted
either a Humpback or Gray whale in the traffic lanes south of Bush Point
. They also told me that
Traffic reported an entangled whale in the same area last night
. It took a long dive after it was first spotted so we don't know direction of travel. (If you see an entangled whale please call NOAA Enforcement and Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline: 1-800-853-1964). -Justine Buckmaster

Elephant Seals - Amazing news from our Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network - "Ellie" the
Elephant seal
who has been coming to
a south Whidbey beach
to rest while molting each spring for the last several years,
is back - with a pup!
This is the first Elephant seal pup we have ever witnessed in our stranding region (Island, Skagit & N. Snohomish), and Steve Jeffries of WA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife reports "Exciting news. We had another elephant seal pup born earlier this year on Protection Island. Pups now born on Whidbey, Protection, Smith, Dungeness and Race Rocks. 10-15 per year" - Elephant seals are one of the species definitely on the increase in the Salish Sea! These beautiful photos are by Jill Hein, Orca Network/CPSMMSN - thanks to Jill and Sandy Dubpernell for following up on this great stranding network call!
