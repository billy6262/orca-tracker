Orca Sightings for March 12, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
12 March update - Orca watchers, another update of location of tagged whale
L84
. On the last update on
9 March the tagged whale was off of Hoh Head
at mid-day heading south. By the morning of the
10th he was near Sea Lion Rock
where they turned north again and by that
afternoon were off Destruction Island
. Starting that evening, L84's tag shifted to an every other day transmission schedule to conserve power. Consequently, there is a large jump between that location and subsequent ones to the south with them being directly off Grays Harbor this morning. -Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging

9:00am Gray whales
this lovely morning along
Langley Beach on Whidbey Island
in the Saratoga Passage of the Salish Sea. Luckily we were having coffee on the deck and heard them breathing up the passage. And then they appeared. Feeding on ghost shrimp by rotating through the water to stir up the shrimp embedded in the sand with their fins. It is quite a ballet to watch as these mammoth sized creatures pirouette horizontally through the sea. -Debra Campbell Designs
