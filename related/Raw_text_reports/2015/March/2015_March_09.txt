9 March update - On Friday 6, March our colleagues at Cascadia Research Collective intercepted
L84
the tagged whale and a few others
off La Push
as the whales moved south. They did not see L121 or any of the whales it would be associated with it as the other whales appeared to be extremely spread out. They were able to collect 4 prey and 3 fecal samples that day. The whales continued slowly south reaching Cape Elizabeth by the early morning hours of the 8th. Here they turned north and by early this morning they were
off La Push
before they again turned south, occurring off of Hoh Head by mid-day today.- Northwest Fisheries Science Center 2015 Southern Resident Killer Whale Satellite Tagging
