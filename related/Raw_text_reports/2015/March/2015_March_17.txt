Orca Sightings for March 17, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
12:30pm -
I saw
three
today! South of Possession Point #s 49, 53 & 723 (so I was told). We were on an Island Adventures boat - the naturalist ID'd them. They were milling, I'm not positive on the direction - they seemed to be heading south when we last saw them. -Meredith Stone

1:05pm -
Hi. I just saw a
Humpback (or a Gray) whale
slowly heading north
between North Beach and Indianola
. Just happened to be looking through the binoculars. Two blows and then a deep dive. Estimated to be mid channel. Possibly with a companion, a darker one. -Ben Blankenship
