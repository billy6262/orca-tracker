Orca Sightings for May 21, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:15-
4:55 pm -
We were headed over to fish for ling cod and this
pod of orca surrounded us between Bainbridge and Seattle
. Do you know which family group it was? The big male had 2 big notches out of its dorsal fin....they were playing with a sea lion for a good 30. At one point the sea lion tried to hide next to my 19' boat. Made me very nervous with the orcas coming in and out under my boat trying to get the sea lion...there also was an orca about 4-6' long with them. They kept circling around like they were waiting for it. Did those transients recently have a calf? Video taken around
4:55PM
between Yeomalt Pt on Bainbridge and West Point on the Seattle side
in the middle of the shipping channel. here was a separate group of 4 that were right off Yeomalt that we saw earlier that were moving quickly heading north and hugging the shoreline. That was around
4:15. -Scott Orness
(Video ID comments per Melisa Pinnow:
Chainsaw T063
is that male with the two notches. The T037, T065, & T090 matrilines were probably there too and if you saw another male, he was probably was T087)

Well, the day started with with
Chainsaw
and ended with another sighting of
3 orca heading SE in Squaxin passage
toward Hunter Pt and the inlet of orca sausages in Henderson Inlet. Harbor seal pupping is close at hand and there is not one orca sausage around Steamboat Is /Carlyon Beach Marina right now. -Lourdes Flores-Skydancer

Here's more from my encounter with
J Pod between Matia and Sucia Island
. These whales were in a resting pattern, where they essentially turn half of their brain off, alternating "sleeping" hemispheres in their brains a number of times during a resting period. When orcas rest, their behavior is also more predictable. They will go down for a 3-5 minuet dive, then surface for 5-6 breaths. J Pod circled around and stayed between the two Islands for about two hours hours last night, barely moving from that location. I don't get to observe the entire pod (minus the independent J16's) resting together very often! I'd take this over breaching whales any day. Watching "resting" resident orcas is like meditation for me. The way their exhalation comes up in synchronicity like smoke stacks, with their breaths equally as in sync, "koof, koof, koof", sends me to an incredibly peaceful place. I'm so grateful that I was there to whiteness this! -Heather MacIntyre
