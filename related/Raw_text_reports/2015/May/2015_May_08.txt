Orca Sightings for May 8, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
A few shots from our encounter with the
T123's and T124C
in the
Strait of Georgia
on the 8th. T123C was doing all sorts of acrobatics for HOURS! She (which we discovered during the trip) seemed to love the waves in the gulf and even caught her surfing a couple. -Gary Sutton

8:30 am - The orcas were sighted around Anderson Island
(south Puget Sound) this morning
between McNeil and Anderson
near the dock, per Anderson Island group FB page. No direction of travel posted. And another post that said this: Killer whales off Eagle Island around
8:30 AM. Snacking on seals. They headed towards Steilacoom from Eagle Island. -Tracy Morris

12:30 pm -
1:19 pm -
Delighted whale watchers aboard the Mystic Sea just left
a lone humpback
feeding just south of
Possession Point
. It's a gorgeous day in Puget Sound!

4:40 pm -
It's traveling to
south Whidbey
now.

4:02 pm - Humpback at Norma Beach
which is south of Mukilteo and south of Whidbey. -Michelle Carey

With such a variety of marine life around us, it's always with a sense of anticipation that 'Mystic Sea' leaves the dock to go and explore... It was our lucky day for
humpback whale
spotting off
Possession Point
, south Whidbey Island, with perfect weather yet again. -Sandra Pollard (Author/Naturalist).
