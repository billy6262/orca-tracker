Entry 1:
Most of today we thought just the J16s were around, but then mid-afternoon the
rest of J-Pod showed up
, too! This evening they all met up and headed down
Haro Strait
together, where I caught up with them in the beautiful late day lighting. Absolutely perfect viewing conditions! -Monika Wieland

WOW. Our encounter today with the
T65A's and T65B's
was incredible!! The weather was also stunning. Lots of sun and calm water. We made our way to
Hein Bank
off the south end of
San Juan Island
. Thought they had been celebrating a kill, however when we looked closer we realized that they were playing with Common Murres! (They are a black and white seabird that we have here). While not unusual to see younger orcas essentially using these birds as target practice and honing their ambush skills, it was unusual that it lasted so long! We even got to hear their vocals with our hydrophone in the water. We also got to see our other wonderful wildlife including a couple mature Bald eagles, Steller sea lions, Harbor seals, and the powerful tidal currents of Cattle Pass. -Traci Walter, Western Prince

We found the
TO65A's & TO65B's
west of
Hein Bank
in the morning and we were treated to one of the best Transient Orca encounters ever! The T's were finishing off a kill when we first encountered them and then began to celebrate their kill, it was an amazing spectacle. In the afternoon we encountered the group between Hein Bank & Salmon Bank and they were still playing. We witnessed so many breaches, tail slaps, cartwheels, spy hops and pectoral waves, it was unbelievable! In 10 years of Whale Watching this was one of the best Transient Orca encounters of my career. -Andrew Lees

7:00 pm -
Watched from the observation deck on the bluff at
Cape Flattery
as a group consisting of
1 adult female & 3-4 babies
made its way into the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca...They approached from open ocean
S of Tatoosh
& swam N into the channel nearest the shore between the shallow reef inshore of the island & the mainland. Once they reached the mouth of the Strait they turned E & presumably continued on deeper into the Strait. -Todd Gillman

6:30 pm -
Jimmy and I headed to the
La Push/Neah Bay
area this weekend to search for gray whales along the migration on the coast. We found the
grays
(and a few babies) but we also spotted
orcas
(our first ever!). Not sure if they were residents or transients since there were only
about 5 of them
....1 Male, 3 females and baby! -Codi Hamblin

Not sure which details Codi already provided but here's the quick run down. Saturday 5/2 around
6:00pm we saw approx
6 orca cruising east between Tatoosh island and the final view point on the Cape Flattery Trail
. They were cruising close to shore and appeared to be headed right down the strait. I counted 5-6 whales including 1 male, 4 females and what looked to be a baby. I initially thought it was a dolphin because the dorsal fin was so short and curved more than the other whales but it was obvious it was an orca when they breached closer to us. Unfortunately they are really hard to photograph and I was also trying to not watch the whole event through the camera viewfinder. Hopefully these are somewhat useful...The initial sighting was in the golden sun reflection on the water and was quite beautiful / surprising. Super excited to have had the chance to see them at such a cool spot. -Jimmy Wood
