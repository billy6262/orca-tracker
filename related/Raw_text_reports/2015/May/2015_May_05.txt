5:00 pm - Saw a Gray whale in Port Susan
(north Puget Sound) while out kayaking. It was traveling south just a 1/4 mile south of Cavalero Beach Park. (Camano Island). It must like to look at boats because I was 300 yards from it and heading away from shore to get out of its way and the next thing I heard it it blow 50 feet behind me! I tried but did not get a good picture of it. It may have had a white patch just rear of center of its back, on the left side. I thought the people with the houses on the beach at Country Club Estates where going to get to see a whale but when it got to their mooring buoys it stopped feeding and head out to deep water. -Andrew Dillon
