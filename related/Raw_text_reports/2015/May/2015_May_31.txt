Orca Sightings for May 31, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
6:30pm - Approximately 14 whales
in the group at the
south end of Lopez Island
feeding, hunting, socializing and playing for over an hour at sundown. -Michael Kundu

A very cool encounter with some of our regular Bigg's Killer whales, the
T65A's
along with some very rare visitors. According to Dave Ellifrit from the Center for Whale research, the
T125's
have not been seen in the area since the 90's! What a remarkable and interesting looking group of orca! T125's consist of T125, T125A, T127, T128. -Traci Walter
*
The
T65As
continue to be one of my favorite family groups, hands down. They are so interesting and always up to something. This was taken in Rosario Strait while they traveled with the
T125s
. -Katie Jones
*
And a little more info. about the encounter from Dave: We left the
T65A's and T125's at 1700
pointed east in
Rosario Strait
after they had traveled deep into Lopez Sound and then exited through Lopez Pass. To my knowledge, this is the first time the T125's have visited the area since the early 1990's. -Dave Ellifrit of the Center for Whale Research

We found th
ese guys (T125s and T65As) near the South end of Lopez Island. At least 3 males, and one youngster about 2 years old maybe? We also found
2-3 humpbacks South of that area on our way back home! Great day on the water! -Janine Harles

Noon Sunday,
May 31st, tight group of
8 orcas slowly cruised past the south end of Lopez Island
, going east to west. Two distinctive male dorsal fins. -Sally Reeve

Hi, My family and I spotted
a pod of Orca
last night (
May 31) while sailing
just south of Point Roberts Marina
. The Pod was fairly widely dispersed, we believe that there were
a minimum of 10 and I'd guess more like 12 - 15 were present
. They were in pairs or individuals spread over approx 1 mile of area. We were approx 48d 57.8N, 123d3.2 W and the pod was all around us, traveling east towards White Rock, BC. We saw them around 8PM We didn't get close enough for any detailed descriptions. We did see one Orca Breach 4 or 5 times, and another one flip it's tail completely over it's head. Amazing creatures. -Andrew Green

Hi we were boating towards the ferry strip tonight around

7:30pm
and we became surrounded with
10-15 Orcas
. We were in our 19 foot boat and the Orcas were
swimming southeast close to Point Roberts
. It was amazing. I would say there was 2-3 pods. There was a massive Orca with a 4 foot fin plus a mama with a calf. The calf was small like a newborn. They were magnificent- majestic- beautiful. The mama & calf came the closest to our boat 50 feet away. The massive Orca with 4 foot fin was about the same. We were the only boat...I will NEVER forget this experience. Wish I had pictures for you! -Karen Conley-Giles

Here are a few shots from a nice day in calm waters with all of
J-pod, in the Georgia Strait
a handful of miles of
Entrance Island (Nanaimo, BC)
. Lots of socializing and activity! -Andy Scheffler
*
Some of the most amazing and rare
Bigg's Killer whales were around the San Juan Islands
today! We later learned after Dave Ellifrit from the Center for Whale Research identified these as the
T125's. (T125, T125A, T127, T128)
These orcas haven't been seen in here for a very very long time! Was a very special thing to see them. They were with one of our regular groups, the
T65As
. -Traci Walter
