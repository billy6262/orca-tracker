Orca Sightings for May 27, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
I got the pleasure of spending my
evening
with mammal-hunting orcas, known as
Transients (T077A and T124C) in Deep Cove, BC
. I love traveling north into the Canadian Gulf Islands, especially in the evening. Nothing beats the lighting on those beautiful islands that are characterized by a folded and faulted succession of metamorphic, plutonic, and sedimentary rocks. Those same island/rocks record nearly 400+ million years of earths history. It's pretty humbling when you think about it! -Heather MacIntyre

9:45 am -
Just saw the backs of
two Orcas about 50 yards off Robinson Beach in Mutiny Bay
, Whidbey Island. -Raymond Bigelow

Mid afternoon
, we spotted a large pod
(about a dozen) from Cape Flattery lookout point
. They were heading west from the mouth of the strait, then disappeared from our view
behind Tatoosh Island
. Fabulous!! -Carol Turner

10:30 am -
I know it's not an orca but saw
a dolphin at Solo Point (south Puget Sound)
this morning about

10:30
this morning. I'm a bit excited since it was my first time seeing one since we moved here. (possibly the lone Pacific White-sided dolphin seen in South Puget Sound since 2014-ALB). -Kim Burton
