Ranger Evan Sobel of
Depoe Bay State Park
in
OR
called in a report of
a pod of Transients/Biggs Orcas
off Depoe Bay, OR - including 1 large male, several females and a few young ones, no direction given - he said the Gray whales were definitely acting a little funny with the Ts around.

T49C
today. We caught up to him in the
Straits of Juan de Fuca off Victoria
- barely over the international line. He zigzagged for a while going on very long 10 minute dives. We left him heading south towards PA. On our way home, we passed him again - this time he was west of the mouth of the Elwha and headed east slowly. -Connie Bickerton

...When Captain Spencer Domico and I got on scene we found
Windy
traveling slowly just off
Patos Island, WA
. surfacing then diving down for about six minutes in a foraging mode... For a while, we were just watching a whale from 200+ yards away surfacing here and there, and every time she'd go down, she'd pop up in an entirely different location. So, we just drifted for a while (it's always nice to hear the exhalation that comes out a little less than 200mph anyway). There's always a certain beauty in watching wildlife no matter what their behavior, but
Windy charging for our boat and spending over an hour with us
was the LAST thing I expected at that time. And then it happened, Windy surfaced closer than normal and was heading in the direction of our boat, the Legacy...At that point, to start the motor and move out of her path would have been dangerous to her, given her proximity to the boat. So, we stayed in shut-down mode and waited for her to mosey on by. -Heather MacIntyre, Naturalist, Maya's Legacy

Windy the
Humpback whale
mugged nearly everyone. This particular Humpback what has a tendency to approach boats on occasion. (she is not always in this mood) None of the vessels in these photos drove to her, she went to them. I was watching her this day for nearly 6 straight hours. For about a half hour or so, she would be doing normal behavior swimming along. Then which ever boat was closest after that 30 min was up, she was drawn to them by reasons that we can only guess why. After "mugging" (getting close to a boat by her choosing) she would move along, take a break, and then check out a different boat. In addition, I noticed that each mugging seemed to have a pattern of it's own. She would look at people on the side, then poke her nose out at them for a time, and then the finale was always her tail up in the air. She seemed to loosely follow this on each of these muggings. If you are lucky enough to have her approach you, please shut down and enjoy. This is behavior of her own choosing, please don't force yourself on her. I've had an encounter similar to this last year, but have no idea if it was Windy or another friendly Humpback whale. All I know is that it was one of the most memorable moments of my life. These animals are making a comeback, however they are facing many man-made threats such as shipping traffic, potential oil spills, and fishing gear entanglements. -Traci Walter, Naturalist, Western Prince

I was on the Western Prince with Ivan and this
Humpback
, came over to us and to the boat and gave us an amazing show. I have also attached a pic with a light house (Patos Island, Washington) so you can see where we were. -Nishan Desilva

2:33 pm - Humpback near Meadowdale.
Last seen headed west toward Point No Point (Kitsap) -Dave Davenport

The
Minke whale Nick Jagger
. So named because of the large nick in the trailing edge of the dorsal. We saw him between Lopez Island and Eastern Bank today. -James Gresham
