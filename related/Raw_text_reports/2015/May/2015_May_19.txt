Orca Sightings for May 19, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We spent Sunday with the
T101's near Deception Pass
and watched as the whales tried to push against an 8 knot flood tide to get out of the pass for over a half and hour! It was an amazing display of power and strength. They eventually made it through a smaller section of the pass and
cruised north in Rosario Strait
. -Katie Jones

Here's some pictures from today's encounter with
J Pod
! Today we watched as J Pod tried to push against a raging current
at East Point
for at least two hours, barley making any headway around the point. They were being very social along the way breaching, spyhopping, and cartwheeling. The encounter was kind of bitter sweet for me though, I wish they'd conserve more energy. Since their habitat is no longer productive with their primary food source, Chinook salmon, these orcas are going to need all of the calories they can get. Despite my concerns, it was definitely incredible to watch. We also got to see some great displays of family unity through respiratory synchronicity as well! -Heather McIntyre

We had
5 (including Chainsaw) from

4:00-
7:00 in Case Inlet
. Then at
9:00, there were 7 (including Chainsaw) heading
deep into Budd Inlet
. No I.D. on the two other stragglers who joined the group in that 2 hour time frame. -Kim Merriman

Lakebay

Herron Island
(Case Inlet) It was Beautiful! -Jen Harris

(Tacoma Narrows Bridge) heading north. -Corrie Githens

4:45 pm - A pod of Orcas passed Point Fosdick
. Feeding, then traveling on the east. I took the picture from my back yard. -Dave McClung

4:35 pm -
Now
heading towards the Narrows Bridge
. Looked like they just made a kill.

4:05 pm - Pod of maybe 6 orcas in Hale Passage
heading towards Wollochet. A slow meander. -Anita Asmussen
*

6:00 pm -
I spotted plumes this afternoon just to the
WSW of Dutchers Cove on the Key Peninsula
. It was difficult to get a good count, but I estimate
4 to 6 whales
. They would resurface every five to seven minutes, heading slowly WSW toward Hartstine Island. My last sighting was around

6:35pm
. traveling. They tended to surface together...lots of spumes then none. This is a first for me...really exciting! -John Lauber
*

4:30 pm -
just sighted
4 orcas
headed north up
Case Inlet
. 3 were grouped together and 1 was a little ways out. I'm located about 1 mile north of Joemma state park in Lakebay. -Herald Ugles
*

4:05 pm - Nisqually reach Baird/dogwood beach. 6 whales, 2 males, 4 females AND a baby!
Close to shore. Must of been getting a snack on the sandbar in front of the house. They were beautiful as always! Even burned my dinner when we saw them ! Worth it! -Denise Roswell
*

2:20 pm - Just off Anderson Island Ferry Dock
. -Lisa Elliot
*
Encounter report: It was lots of fun seeing
Chainsaw (T63)
and his friends around
Anderson Island
. The most I have in any one shot is 5, but I think there were 2 distinct groups of 4-5 individuals, and maybe more than that. We were shooting entirely from beaches, and they
came across from the center of the Sound between Chambers Bay, McNeil, and Steilacoom, then headed around the tip of McNeil
so they were between Anderson and McNeil, heading toward Eagle Island. Once they got to the pier on McNeil beyond the prison, they milled around and went back the way they came, played off the Anderson Island ferry dock for a while, and then headed up the east side
between Anderson and Ketron islands
. At that point, they were moving fast in two widely spaced groups toward the south tip of Anderson Island and were out of our sight. What a day! (I definitely got my exercise booking it up and down beaches . Still working on IDs, but we got a lovely visit from the orcas today - at least the
T65s
(matriarch T65, her daughter T65B, and grandchild T65B1), adult female T37, T63 "Chainsaw" (the male with the huge notches in his dorsal), and the T124s (matriarch T124, daughter T124D, son T124E, and grandchild T124D1). Many thanks to Sara Hysong-Shimazu for working on IDs with me!

2:10 pm -
Changed direction and now headed
between Ketron and Anderson Island
...there were so many originally...the ones we saw heading south past Anderson Island were probably 7, and I think prior to that, we saw 9-12, so it wouldn't surprise me if they split. -Belen Bilgic Schneider
*

1:45 pm -
I lost them at the
SE end of McNeil Island
.

1:10 pm -
I see them from the park just up the street from the
Steilacoom ferry terminal
, closer to McNeil Island and heading toward the prison complex (south). -Gayle Swigart
*

1:00 pm -
they are heading south, up close to
McNeill Island
still north of the pier now.

12:52 pm -
from Chambers Bay, they are close to McNeill Island, heading south towards the pier. Very active right now.

12:35 pm -
I'm way behind them so hard to tell.. but looks like they are
between the Buoy & McNeill Island pier, heading south
.

12:32 pm -
off the
south tip of Fox Island
, before the McNeill Island pier. Milling. -Melissa Bird
*

11:50 am -
they have stayed South of the fishing pier. Lots of breaching, tail slapping, etc.
9 were counted
. Definitely one or more babies. -Heidi Powers Armstrong
*

10:32 am -
Now they are heading toward the
SE end of Fox Island
, towards the fishing pier, theres at least 7!

10:15 am -
We are watching
a pod of orcas
from
SW Fox Island
. The orcas are near the
SE side of Mc Neil
. It looks like 6 or more and some little ones too!! So excited!!! -Julie Gonsalves

Hi there, this evening when I was on the ferry traveling from
Duke Point to Tsawwasen
, I saw
a whale
in the water. Photo's are horrible, it didn't breach so I was only able to see it's dorsal fin. -Kameko Walker
