Orca Sightings for May 25, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
Great day today spent with many different groups of
Transient (marine-mammal hunting) orcas.
We were on the water for about seven hours and loved every minuet of it! The first group of Transients we saw were the
T018's/T019's, T124A's, and T051
who seemed to have switched groups overnight (he was traveling with the
T075B's
and
T036A's yesterday
). These whales were
traveling west close to Sooke, BC
. On our way home Captain James Maya found the other Transients that had been seen earlier today near Kelp Reef! Thankfully Captain Jim stayed with the orcas until we got on scene! On our second trip, we got the treat of being the only boat with the orcas for about an hour as we observed
T077A
(one of the "twins") and
T124C
in the beautiful evening light. It was totally serene ... Oh, and did I mention I got to see my first SEA OTTER EVER?!!! Yeah ... that happened! -Heather MacIntyre

Made the long trip to
Race Rock to see the Ts
heading west, and then found some on the way home! Great day. -James Mead Maya

We were on a 30' sailboat coming down from Mystery Bay on Monday, and saw
a pod of at least 5
close to the mark just
north of Point No Point
. Then the pod moved and stayed very close to the
Point No Point light house
and fed there for some time. We saw either the same pod or another one about 6 or 7 times on the way back to Elliott Bay! They seemed to be paralleling our path! Have never experienced so many orca sightings in one day! Incredible!!!! -Marty Wilhelm

3:00 pm - Lone Orca taken from Eglon. Around 3pm ish
..(I think) I hope some one can identify and let me know who I caught on camera! It was a great day. Saw a total of 3 different groups and the lone guy today.

1:45 pm - At Point No Point
Saw
3 total
one group. And the baby included! And another who has some scarring on the side. Hope this one can be identified. ( "I see T124 and T124E in there but that's the best I can do", Dave Ellifrit-Center for Whale Research). -Becky Newell Woodsworth

1:35pm -
There's
a pod of whales hanging out at Point No Point
(Hanseville, Kitsap peninsula) Another pod went by about a half an hour ago and a big male (guessing) came right up by the shore! -Debbie Ike Mangano
*

1:20 PM - Orcas at Point No Point.
We were on the Southeast shore of Point no Point and sat down. When we looked up we saw a huge dorsal fin right in front of us! The Orca swam off and we thought it odd it wasn't in a pod. Then we walked back around by the lighthouse and the pod was out there meandering. We tried to take a video but our phones could not zoom in. It was a Beautiful sight and I will never forget how big that dorsal fin looked! -Betsy Tarpley

....There are more really spread out. Not sure who they are but definitely transients. We only saw
one male, the rest were females (at least 5-6) with a juvenile
in the mix. They were not traveling with the male at all. He was alone, on the perimeter. There was also either a lone female or possible pre-sprouter male closer to Marrowstone. As I mentioned previously, they were really spread out today. -Renee Beitzel
