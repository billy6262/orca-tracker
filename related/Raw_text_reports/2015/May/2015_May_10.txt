Orca Sightings for May 10, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:45 pm -
A pod of
4 whales just off of Priest Point Park in Budd Inlet heading north
. -Wendy Aubert Mayo
*

7:00 pm - Orca sighting in Budd Inlet
, milling about, splashing vigorously, blowing spray.
6 Orcas
sighted off
Priest Point Park
in Olympia. In coming tide. Orcas very active and in very shallow water over sandy bottom. Appeared to be 2 smaller Orcas among the group. Several boats approached: 2 small power boats, 2 sailboats so they must have much better pictures than the ones attached here. The boats appeared to be too close to the Orcas but the Orcas didn't seem to alter their splashing about. -Jack Daray
*

6:40 PM - 4 orcas
sighted in
Budd Inlet
off Cooper Point Rd, very close to the shore, traveling toward Olympia. -Susan Mouat
*

5:30 pm -
Started to see blows coming south of
Dana Passage and Harstene Island
. Spotted
6-7 Orcas
(assuming T065) currently (
6:00) heading south into
Budd Inlet
and milling in front of Burfoot Park...they have been splitting into two separate groups. It was really windy at that time, and it was tough to see the two groups. -Kim Merriman
*

5:14 pm -
Just saw
four whales
, two quite small. Heading south in
Dana Passage
just at south end of Harstine Island, Brisco Point!! (south Puget Sound). -Tom Yocum
*

9:30 am -
Saw a pod of
10+ orcas
from
Lime Kiln
. They were
heading south
fairly fast. Wondering if anyone was listening on the hydrophone and could identify them as J-Pod? They were too far away to take clear pictures of...they were definitely closer to the Canada side of the Strait...from what I could tell with my binoculars at least 2 males. -Jacqueline Slaughter
*
Windy the Humpback whale's
tail fluke close to shore on
Saturna island, BC
. -Traci Walter
*

5:00 pm -
The
Puget Sound humpback
was still approximately 1/2 mile south of green buoy off
Scatchet Head
. I think she/he is milling in that area for now. Alisa Lemire Broooks
*

4:39 pm -
We are with the
humpback near Useless Bay
. We saw some incredible sea lion interactions at the Possession Buoy, and twice we found the Humpback whale that has been hanging around the area!! -Janine Harles
*

4:30 pm -
Just north of
Edmonds
about 3 miles offshore headed north. Eyes peeled. Max French
*

4:25 pm
- the
humpback
is moving north in the direction of
Scatchet Head
.

4:08 pm - from Haines Wharf (north Edmonds)
just saw a blow looking towards and south of Point No Point, Kitsap. Whale is about mid channel south of Scatchet Head, south Whidbey. -Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

12:56 -
Saw him just now do a half breach.. Still due east of
Point No Point
(Kitsap Peninsula) -Stu Davidson
*

12:45 -
The water was dead calm in
Possession Sound
, visibility good for miles, and the
humpback
whale delighted our passengers, on both cruises, with lots of excellent views of the fluke (tail) as this ~50' whale dove many times. California sea lions and Steller sea lions vied for position on the channel marker, and many Pacific loons were a treat to see. What a great way to end the "Gray whale-watch" season, it seems they received the memo, as no gray whales have been spotted for the past few days. Thanks for such a great season! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
