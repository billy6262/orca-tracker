Orca Sightings for May 30, 2015
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were watching a busy group of
transients (near Bamfield BC)
and then we noticed the
humpback
. The HB kept a low profile and the Bigg's whales passed on by, but there was certainly lots of spy hoping and breaching by the Bigg's. Certainly lucky to get both in the same shot. -Sandra Pollard & Richard Snowberger

No orcas yesterday on our trip out of Anacortes on Mystic Sea but we did catch up with
three humpbacks somewhere near South Pender Island
including we believe Big Mama and Windy. -Bob Mepham
