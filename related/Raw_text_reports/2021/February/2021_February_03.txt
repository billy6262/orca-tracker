I was at the parking lot by
Hidden Beach
from about 0630 until 0830. I could hear him right out in front of the parking lot close to shore while it was still dark. The whale worked his way northward the whole time feeding close to shore. He was still there when I left. The tide was quite high at the time. He was almost all the way to the point to the north when I left approximately 1 mile away. photo - "
Little Patch
coming up to get a bit of the rising sun on his face at Hidden Beach this morning." -Bob VonDrachek
