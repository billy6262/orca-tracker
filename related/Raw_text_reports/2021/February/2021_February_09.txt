I've got eyes on blows coming over the horizon, still well south of 3T. From previous photos looks like at least

14:05 - [orcas]
Passed
Point Robinson
, northbound, grouped up, mid channel, long down times.----I was actually thinking they might have slid past us unseen as this particular group seemed extremely good at being stealthy and quietly made one quick surface off the point before disappearing north. They were zigzagging across the channel trying to shake off a couple boats in pursuit and were very successful in evading and keeping a low profile. Pretty amazing! They didn't come in close, but got enough reach to see those fresh rake marks on
T87s
dorsal which was very cool to see. Always a pleasure to get to visit with the T's, they are fascinating! -Marla Smith

It was a great day down at the beach with a visit from

Such a good day!!!! Started out at an over look over
Commencement Bay
at around 11am Very active and hungry and on the hunt. Looked like they ate one or two Seals, waited a little bit then continued next to the shoreline down to Browns Point. I jumped in my car, saw them at the Lighthouse. The did a swim by real fast. I jumped back into the car and saw them one last time for about five minutes at the Dash point dock. Beautiful day, my body feels alive with excitement! -Desiree Sauve
