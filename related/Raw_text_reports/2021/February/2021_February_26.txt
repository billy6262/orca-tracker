Orca Sightings for February 26, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
~

18:00 - A gray
showed up tonight (Thursday 2/26/21) just before it got dark around 6-6:3-0pm - a little bit late for happy hour, but we were excited to see it regardless. It was feeding at the happy meal mudflats just
south of Mariners Cove
when we first spotted it, and then it slowly worked its way north right past where we were standing, pretty darn close to shore. I could not see any identifying marks in the wind and waves, but the behavior was very different from my pal 2261 from last year. This whale would thrust its head up to spout, but rather than continue moving forward it would pull its head back down, almost in a backward motion. It also exposed more of its body at one time just above the surface. This looked like an enormous gray, but maybe I could just see more of it at a time than I did with 2261. -Marianne Parry
