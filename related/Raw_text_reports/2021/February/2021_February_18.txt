Brian Allen just called. He is observing the group of 4 orcas (one male, and 3 female/young)
off Jefferson Head at N end Port Madison
; they came from west of Indianola, cruised the shoreline ~200 feet off, moving slowly. They are now just hanging off Jeff Head, just west of fishing pier. They've been there 10-15 minutes, and yes, he can confirm tip of males dorsal has the missing chunk and is laying to one side.

, and sounds like they have been out hunting and eating -alb

Sue Larkin called. She observed the
pod of at least 3 (including bull) pass by Fay Bainbridge
about 45 minutes ago (~
08:45). They were in travel mode, stalled for a bit then resumed travel, very close to Kitsap side. She watched as they moved by
Port Madison
and last saw them nearing Point Jefferson, appeared to still be heading north in main channel very close to shore, but cannot confirm they did not duck into north end of Port Madison. (Followup by Sue: After thinking about it... I didn't see the male orca. I will be reviewing my images shortly. He may have been ahead of the group as I watched for 45 minutes and didn't see him behind them.) (Followup #2: Looks like the big male was ahead of them and so I believe I have images of all 4 whales.) -Sue Larkin
