Orca Sightings for February 4, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Boundary Pass - ~

18:00 - Faint killer whale calls were autodetected at Orcasound Lab
. David Bain confirmed the calls were from SRKWs. I have listened to the continuous recording and can add that S16 calls were audible, suggesting K pod presence. I'm not aware of other sightings or other acoustic detections around that time, so direction of travel is unclear. (added by Scott on 2/7: Yesterday during the SIMRES seatalk, Paul Cotrell's pre-recorded talk mentioned SRKWs heard in Boundary Pass and confirmed by "Dr. John Ford as J-pod"... I'm pretty sure Paul said "last Thursday" which would be 2/4/21, but he didn't imply a time of day.) -Scott Veirs, Orcasound

two members of J pod were positively identified near Saturna Island at around 12pm
