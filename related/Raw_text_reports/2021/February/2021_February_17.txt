Center for Whale Research Encounter #8 (sequence #2): " … All of the animals were moving quickly and whether they chose to go north or east from Turn Point, they would soon be nearing Canadian shores. The first animals to reach
Swanson Channel were J38 and J22
and Mark and Joe began their encounter sequence at 1018 at 48 39.9/123 15.6. They were steaming north at a good pace, along with J39 and a couple of the
K13s, K20 and K44
. More animals were spread east toward the Pender Bluffs, so Mark and Joe picked their way carefully that way. A large group quickly arrived from the south, slightly offshore, so the Mike 1 crew zigged that way. This group turned out to be a mix of
Js and most of the L55s!
The five L55s that were most recently encountered by researchers in January in Johnstone Strait - and later that week seen from shore heading southwest from Hannah Heights, San Juan Island - have apparently rejoined the rest of the 18 Ls (and L87) that they are more often associated with. …" [See CWR Encounter #8 for full summary of sequence #1 (included in previous Orca Network Sighting Report) and #2, https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-8 along with photos]

Entry 2:
Haro Strait (J Pod, the K12s, K13s, and L4 sub group) - ~

12:45 -
Ken Balcomb reports
J, K, and L pods went up Haro Strait this morning and are now in Swanson Channel
. He says 30-year-old
L86 Surprise! has a new calf
. The Center for Whale Research is monitoring and documenting them on both sides of the border. We'll see if they split up, continue north through Active Pass into Georgia Strait, or come down Rosario Strait, or back down Haro Strait. It's interesting that all three pods got together at the time of this birth, as happened
September 5, 2020, when J35 Tahlequah gave birth to J57, and K and L pods came in from the Pacific to join J pod. Howard Garrett, Orca Network

Center for Whale Research Encounter #8 (sequence #1): "… We finally saw our first whales right after Mark, who had better sighting lighting from his angle, told us they were just ahead of us. The encounter started at 1014 about a half mile south of
Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island
. We saw several peripheral singles and pairs and a larger group inshore.
K34
was the first whale we got a good look at and he was traveling with a sprouter who turned out to be
L109
. We moved in toward the large which was getting larger as some of the peripheral whales joined it. This large group consisted of
the bulk of J pod along with all of the L4s and L87
. J27 and L87 were part of the group furthest from the boat and those two were taking long dives and not surfacing as much as the others. The
J16s
were the closest whales and they were doing a good job of running photographic screen for the animals on the other side of them. Due to some back lighting along a dark shoreline and the J16s constantly coming up perfectly in the way of everyone else, it was hard to get an idea of who all exactly was in the group. Oh, and did we mention that we had choppy seas and a boat with a deck covered in ice? We were seeing young calves but it was hard to tell who the mothers were as saddles disappeared behind swells. We were convinced that both
J57 and J58
were present but-who was that other calf? We finally got a decent look at it and its mother and it was
definitely a new calf coming up next to L86
. …" [See CWR Encounter #8 (sequence #1) for full summary and more photos.] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-8

I saw three Orcas off of Discovery Park beach heading south at approx. 3 pm today, 2-17-21. They were spouting and had the unmistakable radically vertical and straight tall dorsal fins. I've seen many Orcas, in the San Juans, as well as sailing the Pacific. Beautiful seeing them. A half dozen others on the beach also saw them, and a person in a small open motor boat slowly followed their progress at a distance. They seemed nearly in the middle of the sound, but were probably closer in than that, given they were distinctly visible. I watched them for a half hour or more as they leisurely headed south. -James Thomas

A research boat is with them. West side of channel. Are either

passing
Richmond Beach, headed southbound
mid-channel. Appears to be at least four, traveling in two pairs. Possibly at least one juvenile but hard to tell from this distance. -Anastasia Nicolov

Northbound
. -Anthony Adams (PSWS)
*

09:25:
About 10 minutes ago, I saw a single, big black dorsal fin go under water about a mile north of the
Edmonds ferry terminal
. Not far from Edmonds shore. I think an orca? I've never seen one from our home before so a bit hard to believe. I thought heading south due to curve of fin. I just saw it briefly as the fin was disappearing under water, but it was quite exciting and notable. -Katrina Vickerman
