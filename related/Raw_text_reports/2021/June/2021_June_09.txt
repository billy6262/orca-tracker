1 mile south of
Landbank/Westside Preserve
. The T065As with
T125A and T128
traveled northbound close-in to shore with T128 tail lobbing twice. Easy to identify with interesting dorsal notches and emerging high enough from the water for a good look at eye patches too. Very beautiful and bold against the bright blue water.
Matriarch T065A and her family T065A2, T065A3, T065A4 and young daughter T065A6 traveling with T125A and T128.
(I wasn't able to identify T065A5 in the jumble of black and white.) Photos taken from shore enlarged and cropped. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Center for Whale Research Encounter #36: "… The whales were close into shore and were just coming from around the corner at
Kanaka Bay
. They were in a tight group and briefly pointed offshore before continuing up the San Juan Island shoreline. We couldn't tell if they had made a kill but they seemed to acting socially and there was some splashing, rolling, and several tail lobs. T65A6 did several inverted tail lobs. We had one good pass and then had to be patient as the whales made their way slowly up the west side of SJI with the incoming tide. The
T65As (T65A5 was not present) plus T125A and T128
passed Lime Kiln and were off Bellevue Point by 1500. …" [See CWR Encounter #36 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-36
