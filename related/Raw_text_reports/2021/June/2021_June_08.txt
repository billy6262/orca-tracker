Orca Sightings for June 8, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
an Juan Islands (T123s) - ~

16:00-

16:40 -
We'd also caught wind that there were
orcas making their way south down Orcas Island
, so we went north to investigate. Family turned out to be the T123s. We found them off the east side of Orcas near
Doe Bay
and watched as they moved south, tucked VERY tightly to shore, aimed for Deer Point and Obstruction Island. We spent roughly 40 minutes with them (est.

16:00-
16:40), never approaching closer than roughly 320-360 yards (we had a laser to measure our distance) before we had to head back to Cap Sante before the boat launch closed. During our encounter, the group was pretty tight knit and down times were between 2-4 minutes. Surfacing and traveling behavior only. When they rounded Deer Point and made a slight southwesterly turn toward Obstruction, they surfaced in a perfect line. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network

Tue,
June 8 - San Juan Islands (T46Bs) - … Our passengers were excited at the chance to see the orcas who were identified as the
T46B's (minus the T46B1's)
. The orcas turned
east in Presidents Channel
moving away from us we kept up the pace with the hopes to catch up. We had wind up San Juan Channel, but once we reached Presidents Channel it was like glass. We were surrounded by gorgeous scenery in every direction. With the ebb current against them the orcas took their time moving up the channel. When we reached Pt. Hammond, we started seeing the fins and blows of the orcas. They zig zagged their way north passing a lone seal and many harbor porpoise on the way. They paralleled the US/Canada border but to our delight stayed on the US side. At Boiling Reef the currents were impressive. Porpoise were popping up all around us. The orcas did a 180 and turned back south treading water against the now strong flooding current. We paralleled them for a bit, but after one long down time they disappeared on us. Presumably they turned back north and zoomed away quickly on the flood. photos - "T46B's and Alden Pt. Lighthouse,

Entry 2:
North Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet (T65As minus T65A5, T125A and T128) -

21:00 -
Last seen heading back up the west side of Whidbey. I can't be sure if I saw all 3 males, so not sure if the group split.

20:25 -
Found them again. Still milling around about same spot but trending north now.

19:50 -
That was like a firework finale. They jumped, splashed, slapped, repeat and then poof they're gone.

19:30 -
Think they just made a kill and milling around halfway
between Eglon and Kingston
, still trending south. Definitely 3 large males.

18:55 -
Still heading
SB
about 1/3 of the way from
Eglon to Kingston
. Pretty sure I made out 3 large dorsal. 3 males.

18:36 - Southbound towards Kingston
, maybe kind of east, too. Hard to tell through telescope but their fins are looking bigger to me and I'm in Mukilteo.

18:20 - SW of Possession Point near Eglon
. Spread apart in 3 small groups. Heading south at a decent speed. -Alice Thuy Talbot

17:44 -

Lots of activity s
outh of Useless Bay/north of Hansville

17:20 - Orcas
are likely off
Double Bluff
now, they went out of our sight, still headed SE, likely going for Possession Sound unless they change their minds.

17:07 -
One male out front SE of the green channel marker hunting/direction changes, 2nd male and rest of the pod further behind but now south of or SE of the green marker. Looks like they are angling toward Possession Sound at this point.

17:00 -
Two males now
between green channel marker and Pt. No Point
, looks like they are pausing to make a kill.

16:55 -
Male in the lead, they are moving pretty fast mid-channel, should be
between Pt. No Point and SW Whidbey
soon unless they get distracted and stop to hunt.

16:45 -
Just saw them from ON HQ (1 mi so. of Bush Pt.); they are off the NW end of
Skunk Bay
, continuing south. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

15:15 - 125A and 128 have joined the T65As.

15:10 -
Anna SinghDeo and Pip Gordon called to report seeing the
orcas who are still in the Bush Point area
. They are seeing 6 orcas (3 bulls, one young, and couple females). The group is now to the south of the lighthouse on the Whidbey side. First picked them up when
the group was north, but now seem to be trending south while milling
. Maybe hunting.

Two whales close pass at
Bush Point, nb
. ----I made it just in time to see these brothers,
T125A and T128
, passing close to shore at
Bush Point
. I'm not sure whether I was bowled over by the proximity and power of the encounter, or whether I was simply puffed out as I haven't moved so fast to get anywhere in ages, let alone whipping out the camera and pointing more in hope than expectation... Wow! photos - "

Whidbey, northbound, a few yards from the shoreline." photo - "
