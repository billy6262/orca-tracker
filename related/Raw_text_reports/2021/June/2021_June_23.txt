They were on Scatchet side. drove over to Sunset Hill Dr. and could see them out from the head and closer to Whidbey, nb. I left from there and met up with Dori and Durand at
Maxwelton Park
; we could see them still
moving nb
, and at that time middle of Useless Bay heading towards north Double Bluff. … a little after 9 pm, after we pretty much gave up, we were heading back towards the sunset, I look over to our left, boom, there those stinkers are! they skirted along the inside of the DB green nb channel marker. perseverance and taking in other beauty was so worth it all. I have no idea what group this was, other groups, Kitsap side and Hood Canal (
T65A's

A few hundred feet south of

, and a few hundred feet off shore. Clear blue sky, 67 degrees F. Calm - no wind. I'm at 240' elevation adjacent to Maplewood Park at the end of 143rd St. in Gig Harbor. Saw what I assume was a male orca dorsal fin and part of his back come out of the water. Fin and back were all black. Sighting lasted a couple of seconds at most. A little turbulence under the water after he went down. About 5 or 10 minutes later, made an identical sighting. This time the whale was probably 1/4 to 1/2 mile off shore. -Brian Heath
