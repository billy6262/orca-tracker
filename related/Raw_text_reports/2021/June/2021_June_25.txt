--- Surfing sunset whales - what a wonderful combination. After something akin to a leisurely stroll with mixed surface activity as they made their way north in Admiralty Inlet, the T34s and T37s picked up the pace surfing the wake of a freighter with considerable aplomb. Loud booms reverberated across the water as at least one whale repeatedly rode the ensuing waves, slapping the surface with enormous energy and power. What better way to wind down from the heat of the day as they passed Bush Point and Lagoon Point against the background of a deepening sunset glow. -Sandra Pollard
