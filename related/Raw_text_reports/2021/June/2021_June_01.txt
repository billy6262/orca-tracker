The Transient Killer Whales were just south of the Gray Whale heading north. They treated us to another hunt, this time on a Harbor Seal. Young

even did a few celebratory belly flops right before sharing his meal with his mother
T77 Asja
. A curious youngster from the T65A pod (either T65A5 or T65A6) approached our vessel apparently checking us out and forcing us to shut down the engines until his/her curiosity was satisfied. All photos were taken with a telephoto lens and cropped. All whale watching laws, regulations, and guidelines were followed during this encounter. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

June 1 - E Strait of Juan de Fuca - Minke mania today in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. … We scouted out the banks, and found
minke whales at Eastern and Partridge
. There were at
least five minkes in total, with Trotsky II
amongst them. Trotsky II seemed very comfortable with us, and came in for multiple close passes. Later on, we watched minkes actively feeding amongst flocks of birds, Mount Baker watching over the scene. We really couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day to be on the water. … Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
