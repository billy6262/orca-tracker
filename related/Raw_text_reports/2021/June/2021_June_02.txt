Some of the Orcas have picked up the pace

T65As, T77 and T77E
, who were well spread out across the bay as they meandered
northbound
. There was a sudden shift to pick up the pace after the whales re-grouped and did an about turn, before they affected
another directional change
moving across to the Tulalip side as they exited Port Susan against the hazy, but nonetheless dramatic, backdrop of Mt. Rainier (images Sandra Pollard, zoomed/cropped). -Sandra Pollard
