Center for Whale Research Encounter #40: "About an hour after departing the T036s, Mark and Joe were angling offshore when Mark spotted a quick series of blows tight to the shoreline of Vancouver Island, just
west of San Simon Point
. … The large group was determined to be composed of the rare T064Bs and T068Cs, a more commonly encountered T077 and her youngest offspring T077E, and two animals travelling away from their given matrilines of late, T037A1 and T065A5. …" [See CWR Encounter #40 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-40 for full summary and photos]

closer to Camano Island, still southbound. Viewing from Whale Bell Park in Langley.

15:11 - Orcas have passed close to Fox Spit
, Whidbey, steady southbound as the rain begins to fall.
----With their continuing presence in the inland waters of Puget Sound, sightings of the
T65As
seem to have been an almost daily occurrence for some time now. Resuming their southbound travels in Saratoga Passage, the orcas passed Hidden Beach, Whidbey, just after whale watchers had - with baited breath - waited out a heavy shower threatening to diminish visibility, before continuing south toward Fox Spit. From there they maintained a steady travel pattern past Langley (it's such fun to ring the whale bell in Seawall Park), before rounding Sandy Point to a rumble of thunder, and beyond to Possession (photos Sandra Pollard). photso - "
