============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Mon,

Entry 2:
San Juan Islands/Fidalgo -

20:20 -
Elizabeth Drosda called to report they've been watching 2
groups of orcas in Burrows Bay and Burrows Channel
over 1-1/2 hours. At 7pm they came into Burrows Channel, looked like they were hunting. She and others were standing on the bluff, orcas came in very close and took a peek at them and then that group of orcas (including what looked to be 6 males) progressed across Burrows Bay off the Skyline neighborhood. There was another group of who looked to be females totaling ~5-6; they didn't spend as much time in Burrows Channel so didn't get as good a look at them.
