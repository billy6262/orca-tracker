============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Wed,

Entry 2:
(T46Bs incl. T46B1s minus T46B1B) -

16:04 -
Faint
calls and EL clicks on LK hydrophone
. -Fred Horn
*

15:32 - [orcas]
A few just passed
County Park northbound
at a good pace. -Jill Clogston
*

14:25-

14:40 -
The group appeared again at
Edwards Point
having changed direction up island.
Southbound
for a short while they began to mill and perform some serious splashy porpoising as the headed north again out of sight.

13:40-

14:17 - Bigg's transients T46Bs northbound 1 mile south of Landbank/Western Preserv
e. A group of 3 closer in and 2 farther out, they came together about a 1/3 mile offshore continuing north and meeting up with 2 additional orcas,
T46B1 and T46B1A
. They seemed to be socializing or greeting one another just south of Edwards Point by milling and resting sideways, displaying a belly roll, a few fluke lobs and a breach. They continued north past Edwards Point and out of sight. IDs courtesy of Monika Weiland Shields. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
*

12:44
- Oh my goodness. The orcas just popped up. Just
north of Eagle Point heading north
. Close to shore. Looks like about five in the group closer to shore and I could see a couple further out that were coming in from Hein Bank. The ones closer to shore do not have any large males with them. I did see one large male that was traveling further out by Hein Bank. Possibly another large male too out there but pretty hard to see. Nobody is coming up on a regular basis. Long dives. The group closer to shore has a younger one with them that's quite playful. -Chris Wilson
[
"The 5 inshore would be the
T46Bs
who came down through Cattle Pass! No males and one youngster. The two whales that came in from Hein Bank and joined up with
the 5 T46Bs were T46B1 and T46B1A
." -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI
]
*

11:05 - Exiting Cattle Pass

10:50 - Milling in Cattle Pass.

09:00 - T46Bs milling near Turn Island in San Juan Channel
. Potentially more seen in San Juan Channel earlier this morning and lots of inbound Ts from the Strait of Juan de Fuca last night…
----The morning starting with
the five T46Bs in San Juan Channel
, and they were later joined in Haro Strait by
the two T46B1s
.
T46B1B, better known as Tl'uk, the so-called "white whale" who has been in the media, has not been traveling with his family since the end of April
. There was one poor-quality but convincing video of a white whale filmed near Nanoose, BC at the beginning of May, but no reports of him since then despite his family being seen regularly. Born at the end of 2018, he's likely too young to be dispersed from his family, so while it's especially difficult to say with Ts, the prognosis is not looking good. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

08:15-

09:00 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #41: "… The whales were still milling off the east side of Turn Island when we ended the encounter at 0900. … We met up with "Moja" off False Bay and Michael switched boats in order to fly the drone over the
T46Bs
for his behavior study and to help look for whale poop. Dave headed to the fuel dock and then went home. Later in the day,
T46B1 and T46B1A
showed up and joined the rest of the T46Bs who had headed south in SJ Channel and had exited
Cattle Pass
earlier. These seven whales headed up the
west side of San Juan Island
. Dave watched from shore as the whales chased some harbor porpoise off Edwards Point before continuing north past Landbank by mid-afternoon." [See CWR Encounter #41 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-41

I could hear the blows, soft and gentle sighs, but I couldn't find the
humpback
. And then close-in it surfaced heading straight toward me. Just
south of Edwards Point traveling southbound
swinging very close to shore, then milling and changing direction to the north, up island towards Landbank/Western Preserve. It submerged and then I saw it slowly glide by under the water 40 feet from shore, it's body just under the surface. This beautiful humpback had suffered serious injury from a vessel strike but its wounds seemed to be closed and healing. Take care my friend. I am sorry you had to suffer and I wish you a long and prosperous life. -Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
