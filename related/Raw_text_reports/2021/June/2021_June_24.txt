Entry 1:
BIGG'S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Thu,

Entry 2:
San Juan Islands/Juan de Fuca (T49C) -

15:35-

16:10 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #44 cont.: "… A little while earlier, T49C had been found at the bottom of Rosario Strait and he was now reported to have been heading west along the Lopez Island shoreline. At one point, all the whales in the group we were with made a turn to the east and it appeared like they must have heard T49C say something. We thought he might show up and join the group but they soon pointed back north toward Salmon Bank. We left the group around 1510 about one mile southwest of the Salmon Bank Buoy to go in search of T49C. We headed inshore toward Long Island before looking through the binocs and finding the boats who were with T49C a good two miles to the south of us. We took off in that direction and got to
T49C around 1535 as he was charging west near MacArthur Bank
. T49C continued fast traveling westerly on a line that would take him north of Hein Bank and in the direction of Constance Bank. T49C was cooperative and maintaining a straight line while he was up for his short dives. We ended the encounter at 1610 approximately a mile north of the north buoy at Hein Bank. …" [See CWR Encounter #44 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-44

17:30-

We encountered
T125A, T128, T77C & T77D, and the T036's just north of Cattle Point Lighthouse
, headed north, as they hugged the Lopez Island side; each matriline seemed to stick to their own group, though they stayed within half a mile of each other during the duration of our visit. The brothers traveled very close together, as did T77C & D; mostly long down times and average travel speed/behavior (6-10 minutes). T77C has an interesting white, slightly protruding/healing circular wound on their port side, just in front of the dorsal fin (see photo). Though photos were distant and the heat distorted many of them (may have been within 250 yards a couple times, but never any closer), I was able to ID
T036 and each of the T036Bs
. When we turned the corner, due east, and approached the Lopez Island Ferry Terminal,
T125A and T128 headed due NW
pointed toward Orcas Island, and the T77's and 36's continued due SE. We left them shortly after as we had to make our way back to Skyline, but those two groups seem to still be trending due SE, as if they might take Thatcher Pass. Encounter date 6.24, time roughly ~

Center for Whale Research Encounter #44: "… We arrived on scene about a mile southwest of the north buoy of
Hein Bank at 1355. A group that included T36, T36B, T36B3, T77C, and T125A
were milling and socializing with each other and were not really going anywhere. Another group including T128 was about three quarters of a mile to the southwest of these whales. We got some photos of the first group including a shot of T77[C]'s odd looking wound that seems to be healing. We then started heading toward the other group but they turned north and started to charge back toward the first group before we could get there. All nine whales present were then in one loose socializing group pointed slowly north toward Salmon Bank. …" [See CWR Encounter #44 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-44

Entry 4:
Strait of Juan de Fuca/Race Passage (T65Bs, T75C and T75C2) -

10:50-

12:25 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #43: "… They decided to round the shore of Bentinck Island and with the help of a MMO colleague monitoring the military blasting at
Bentick Island
they were soon able to relocate the whales, now clear of the fog and still
eastbound
. The encounter began at 1050 at 48° 18.6' N / 123° 31.3' W with just two animals, shortly confirmed to be T075C and her young offspring T075C2. After following the pair for a sequence of breaths, three more animals were spotted just ahead of them. The T075Cs and Mike 1 soon caught up to the leading T065Bs. They dove, and were next seen a mile astern of the research boat, now travelling northwest. …" [See CWR Encounter #43 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-43 for full encounter summary and photos]

We've been scanning pretty hard for a while now to the north of their last sighting with no luck. There is a pretty good chance they may have flipped south or southwest from Bush Point within the last hour. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

12:40-

13:24 -
Watched a small
(4-6) group of Ts spread way out across Admiralty Inlet at Bush Point, heading north
. A male was in front with another male across Admiralty and behind, and females and calves a half mile or so back. For a while they had surrounded 6-8 harbor porpoises in the shallow upwellings near the beach, setting up what looked like a predation event, but I never saw it happen if it did. They all seemed to be strolling by at a slow pace headed north, with no splashing, barely surfacing, not even showing their saddle patches. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

HUMPBACK WHALES - Thu,
June 24 - Haro Strait - Center for Whale Research Encounter #44: "… Right before we left the T65Bs and T75Cs, we heard that
a pair of humpbacks were seen heading north off Lime Kiln
. We headed back home toward Snug Harbor and found the humpbacks off Kellett Bluff. It was a mother and calf pair and they were traveling slowly north with no fluking. The adult whale looked really skinny and we hoped this was because she was still nursing." [See CWR Encounter #44 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-44 for full encounter summary]
