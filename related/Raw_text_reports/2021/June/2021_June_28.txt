spotted very near shore this morning at about

between McNeil Island and Fox Island
Washington. Headed north/west. Followed far away in kayak until about
6:30. Follow-up: It was breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful. It was so tranquil this morning so I heard their blowhole sounds immediately upon stepping outside. They were just bobbing along the surface. Unfortunately, I don't know enough to confirm that there were any males. If I had to guess though, I would say no. I saw all four dorsals, several times and I don't believe any were that large…but not sure. And yes,
north through Carr Inlet

Just outside Cedrona Cove,

Roughly 300' off shore. Last saw a whale this close to shore 3-4 years ago, on 6/23, so timing was pretty similar! -Chris Reanier
