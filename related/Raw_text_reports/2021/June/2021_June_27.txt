Viewing from
Purdy Spit
boat launch and the 2 whales are headed back out towards Minter mid-channel from Henderson Bay after coming at the way into the bridge.
---- After missing the
T77'S
going under the
Fox Island bridge
last night and by Bella Bella Beach this morning (by only 2 minutes) we finally caught them at the Purdy Spit. The thrill of the chase and joy in finding the orcas never gets old for me!! I love that my kiddos get to experience seeing these majestic creatures in their natural habitat and not in an aquarium setting. One of my favorite parts about living in Gig Harbor for sure!!!

Saw orcas this a.m. between

2 long dives and they're already turned around and back out of the narrow part of

08:20 - [orcas]
2 leisurely pace south,
8:20, south around
Fox Island
from sand spit at Bella Bella Beach.
----A few shots from today's whale spotting adventures. It's too hot now I'll have to cross my fingers that they pass my house. First four are from 6/27/21 @
8:20 from the sandspit at
Bella Bella Beach
. The last five are from Purdy by the bridge looking out into Henderson Bay @
11:45. On close review I think the early two are different whales than the later two. -Stacey Crofoot
