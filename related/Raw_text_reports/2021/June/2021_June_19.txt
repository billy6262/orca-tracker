Not sure if this is informative or helpful but we saw a
single orca Saturday around
3:00pm at the lighthouse on Stuart Island
in USA waters. He/she breached several times then went under. The two whale watching boats turned around and headed back to it quick but I think it went into Canadian waters. Big crowd gathered on shore to watch. Maybe a transient. I looked to see if anyone else reported it but I had NO cell service on Stuart Island. -Ann McQueen

southbound
. (47.619012, -122.4511150)

19:50 -
At least some of the orcas are now at north end of and skirting outer
Elliott Bay
, west and just north of the anchored blue/red tanker. East of mid channel. Slow steady
southbound
travel, resting mode...spread out N/S. (47.629092, -122.442183)

17:45 - Orcas
, looks like maybe all, spread out making a lot of directional changes and surface active
between Richmond Beach Saltwater Park and Carkeek Park
between mid-channel and shore!

17:00 -
The one group killed small mammal off
Richmond Beach
, were here briefly then moved offshore and disappeared while others were mid channel
southbound
. I then saw a group about
17:10 grouped steady southbound just south of Richmond Beach/Jefferson Point. I've not relocated them since, but was busy so lost them.

16:50 -
Surfaced right off shore n of n end
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park

One group super close to shore N end
Richmond Beach
, Shoreline city limits.!!! Southbound. Then disappeared for now anyhow. Squee. (47.776929, -122.398879)

15:35 - This big beautiful group of orcas continues slow
southbound
travel, ~1.5-2 knots. Lead group (not by much) is tight group of ~15 w/tightly grouped pod of ~5 just behind. Breathtaking to see so many orcas breathing and surfacing in sync. They have moved a little SW, currently ~3+ miles due south of Possession Point, Edmonds side of channel. Few rec vessels and one WW out there all still being mindful and abiding Be Whale Wise.

15:00 -
The orcas are
~2.5 miles southeast of Possession Point
and out from just slightly north of Haines wharf, N Edmonds (47.876443, -122.370739). Some directional changes, thought they were hunting but they are trending slowly southbound.

14:00 - Orcas
are still traveling slowly
southbound
approaching southernmost end of Possession Sound, south of Big Gulch,
S Mukilteo
. Split in three tight distinct groups close to each other. Some directional changes a bit ago but looked like youngsters socializing together. Still primarily in resting mode as they near northernmost edge of Puget Sound proper. (47.905026, -122.346672)

13:25 - Bigg's
appear to have moved back, more toward mid channel. Now south of
Mukilteo Beach/Glendale
, Whidbey Island. Tight larger group mid channel w/tight smaller group just yards west of. More lazy tail slaps while they continue
southbound
in resting mode. So beautiful.

13:10 -
Between
Clinton and Glendale
(closing in on). Super cute baby breach sequence at least half dozen! Split in at least two groups one west of mid channel and one sightly more west. Steady southbound. (47.949677, -122.340870)

12:45 -
Group has been spread in several sub groups, and mixing it up... moving in different directions still slowly milling finishing up meal(s). Headstand, more tail lobs (young and old); young one forward lunge. Drifting south into the ferry lanes, but not traveling yet. Ferry negotiating their presence nicely and all vessels very respectful distance at idle. Any other boats just transiting at great distances. Surprisingly calm out here the Saturday before summer.

12:30 -
Been watching this group for about 15 minutes, circling very lazily making directional changes, some logging, lazy tails lobs, etc. As of now they aren't going anywhere. Still just
north of Muk/Clinton ferry lanes
mid channel. Very quiet seas. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
