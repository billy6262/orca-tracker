UNCONFIRMED SPECIES - Sept 28:
~

16:25 -
Earlier this morning, I left a voice message on your "spotter" line, sharing that I had seen multiple Orcas from my home in Ledgewood Beach (Coupeville). I am writing to tell you that over the last 10 or so minutes (beginning around
16:25) I spotted several Orcas swimming in the ocean near Ledgewood Beach. I'm not sure how many I sighted; I can say for certain that I saw the fins of two different orcas swimming alongside one another. P.S. I want to clarify that I am watching them through a high-quality Leica spotting scope, so I am absolutely certain that what I have been seeing are not artifacts, ducks, or wavelets. After writing the first email, I went back and began watching again, and I can confirm that I saw 3 separate orcas in the same area. From my vantage point, they seemed to be swimming back and forth from north to south in the same relatively small area. -Tara Klein
Tara Klein, new to Ledgewood, Whidbey neighborhood in April, and lifelong lover of orcas called on Tuesday 09/28 with two orca sightings. They have view facing Port Townsend and she reports 2 days ago (Tue, 09/26) first seeing large black dot, then animal breached so she could confirm orca. Did not see any additional individuals. Then this morning (Thu, 09/28) in same area, she saw black bodies, one swimming and undulating. Thinks she saw 3 individuals based on distance and surface behavior. Direction most likely north. Orcas were closer to Ledgewood than to either Keystone or Port Townsend.
