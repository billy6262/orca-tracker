UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Thu, Sept 23 - South Puget Sound - Belen Schneider emailed: I just had a long-time islander (on Anderson Island) reach out to me with a strange sighting and I wanted to check in… "Just saw something I can't identify. Looked like a whale, acted like a whale, cruising by quickly heading west. through Balch Passage. No dorsal fin. I looked it up and am wondering if it could possibly be a Northern Right Whale Dolphin? But all alone. It was the only one. Have there been any similar sightings that you know of? Am getting ready for work right now so don't have the time at this moment to research anything more…and it was cruising by so fast I could not get pictures." -Pete Common
