EPIC day at
Deception Pass with T18 and T19s: T18 Esperanza (b.1955) is the matriarch, T19 Nootka (b. 1965) her daughter, T19B Galiano (b. 1995) and T19C Spouter, (b. 2001) the "little" brother.
My friends called me about 9 to say they'd seen them in Cornet Bay, so I figured I missed them, again. But when we motored out about
10:15, we saw they were over by Canoe Pass. They attempted numerous times to go out under the bridge, but the tide was too strong (about 5-6 knots), so they retreated to the calm water by Canoe Pass. Each time they tried, they'd go to the south side, in the beautiful backlit light, and really exert themselves, with huge exhalations hanging in the air. Finally, after almost 2 hours, they headed east, almost to the beginning of Saratoga Passage, then turned back toward the bridge. Incredible lighting, so beautiful! They made it out (tide had slowed to about 3 knots) and headed north west. What a treat to see this beautiful family, and it was really interesting to speculate about their decision making. Lots of photos, all zoomed and cropped. -Bonnie Gretz
