There were at least two groups
T137 and 137B

2, possibly 3 orcas, including a male, southbound, well west of mid-channel off
Rolling Bay, Bainbridge
. Long down times, slow, steady pace. NOAA passed east side of channel at
14:45 (not with this group) and continued south. This group went by seemingly undetected by NOAA. Saratoga [Puget Sound Express] also passed by them headed back to Edmonds but on the other side of the channel closer to Shilshole. Don't think they were aware of this group either. -Susan Marie Andersson
