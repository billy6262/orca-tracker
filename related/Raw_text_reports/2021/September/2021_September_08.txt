11:00-

Center for Whale Research Encounter #66: "â€¦ For the next 3 hours, he worked through the group, hoping to find some of the ones that weren't seen on the 6th. He was able to confirm
L125 along with her mom, L86
, although she was swimming with
L83
. None of these three were seen on the previous encounter. He was fairly confident that it was
all of K pod and Ls less the L12s and L54s.

20:13-

20:45 -
After it was dark
J-Pod headed back north
. The entire group, some very close to shore surfaced often, big blows like exclamations in the night. Breaching over and over punctuated by fluke lobs and splashing, the sounds were exhilarating. Breaching close to shore, boom boom boom. Never have I ever!

17:35-

19:20 -
Direction change as
J-Pod begins to turn southbound
at
17:35. Spread out, some moving quickly and some slowly milling in big circles. Most in small family groups although the big males were solitary.
J40 Suttles with J37 Hy'Shqa. J58 Crescent and J41 Nova with their Mom J41 Eclipse. J56 Tofino with Mom J31 Tsuchi
observed milling for almost an hour and then joined for a short time by J16 Slick and daughter J36 Alki who I believe was with J53 Kiki (or did Nova circle back on his own). By
19:10 only on large male in sight, slowly moving south, big blows golden in the fading light, majestic against the backdrop of the mountains. Photographed from shore 1 mile south of Landbank.

16:46-

17:35 -
Blows to the south (1 1
/2 mile S of Landbank
) and visual of 1 male NB and within minutes
J16 Slick
going ahead northbound. Hard to count in sun's glare and choppy water, 9-10 members of J-Pod northbound towards Edwards Point and Landbank while 4-5 remained south of me, milling and hunting (my guess). Choppy seas, glare and heat distortion made viewing challenging at times.

12:48-

13:30 -
A single orca seen 1 1/2 miles south of Landbank, milling and trending north. As she got closer, I could see it was J16 Slick. She was hunting in big circles with long dives, changed direction at
13:20 and hurried south out of sight. I could hear a few blows to the south as I watched her. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
*
A couple photos of
J-Pod
from 9/8/21,
southbound between Edwards Point and Pile Point
in the low sun. Michelline Halliday kindly loaned me one of her cameras - already set up for conditions - and I got some lucky shots. The leaping kid is shortly after
J57 Phoenix and J35 Tahlequah
were seen going past Hannah Heights, but I never got a good look at the adult's patch to confirm ID. Thanks! -Ben Bama

Wed, Sept 8 -
Skagit Bay to Rosario Strait (T65As, T65Bs) -

The T65As and T65Bs have exited Puget Sound, presumably through Deception Pass. They are now
northbound
in Rosario Strait near James Island along with the T37As. -Justine Buckmaster, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

T37As
were photographed in Penn Cove "around mid day" -gs
]
*

08:08 -
Trisha Ferreira called to report
4-5 orcas near Goat Island off N end Oak Harbor
, Whidbey. First watched them heading towards Deception Pass but then pod circled back, then while on phone they popped up close to shore, then head directionally toward Goat Island so no clear direction at this time. Sounds like they might be hunting.

UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Wed, Sept 8 -
Saratoga Passage -

15:35 - 3 Whales in Saratoga Passage heading south, very close to Whidbey side. South of Onamac Point. Not orcas.
Follow-up: 3 spraying, very clear breach but no dorsal or tail fin. Was sure it was going to be the orcas that were reported north of my location earlier in the day. Based on previous viewing from my home, my thought was humpback but I didn't think any were in the area. Very odd. -Marie Heil
