15:00 -
I had a chance to go try to see
J pod
today on their way
southbound
. I saw them first about
11:30 from Norwegian Park, then moved to
Eglon and Kingston
and left them about
3:00. Definitely a binoculars only viewing kind of day. So fun to watch with lots of tail lobs and cartwheels. My pictures are all teeny tiny because they were all the way across but so special to have seen them. Glorious day on the beach with other orca fans. -Stacey Crofoot

Still seeing them off

.

11:00 -
Seeing a tight group off
Mutiny Bay
, heading south with cartwheels, breaches, taillobs, and every kind of surface activity. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

11:30 -
It is hard to judge distances and angles, but they seem to be about level with the southern end of
Mutiny Bay
, still headed S, perhaps further into the shipping channel. There is a small boat with them, that is doing an admirable job of keeping other boats away. The Orcas are still quite active, spyhops, tail lobs, etc.

11:01 -
The orcas are about mid
Mutiny Bay
, between the shipping channel and Whidbey. They are still going slowly south and they are still quite active.

10:27 - [J pod]
They are having a party just off bush point. Lots off jumping, trail slaps and spyhops. They are slowly going south. -Mike Meyer

I can hear faint
Orca vocalizing on the Bush Point hydrophone
. -Nancy Erikkson

08:45 -
Still just
south of Lagoon Point
on Whidbey side. Some surface activity, but seem more committed to southern travel. I believe it's part of the same group. We've had eyes on them the whole time. They were broken up into several groups though, so possible that one slipped ahead while we were distracted with another. In total, a lot more than the 7 I originally reported. Hard to say how many, but saw 2 babies and multiple males. (We did get a visual with an open saddle patch on a male this morning.)

08:28 -
Thought I may have seen 2 babies up at the same time! Yay, residents!!!!!

08:20 -
Still at very
southern end of Lagoon Point
, but have moved further out towards Whidbey side of midchannel.

08:00 -
There are more than I first realized. At least 10. Seems to be a baby with them. Continuing with lots of surface activity.

07:40 - [J pod]
At least 7 orcas in
Admiralty Inlet off southern end of Lagoon Point
. Lots of surface activity. Appear to be hunting while heading slowly south. Bear Whidbey side of channel. -Margaret Marshall

BIGG'S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Tue, Sept 7 -
Haro Strait (T18s) -

10:25-

10:33 -
Hearing the blows before I saw them, 4 Bigg's Transients southbound 1 mile south of
Landbank
Westside Preserve. I saw
T019B Galiano
with his wide impressive curved dorsal fin followed by
T018 Esperanza and brother T019C Spouter
. To my left I saw that mom
T019 Mooyah
had already passed me. This is an impressive family to see and they really impressed me this morning as they came within less than 100 yds from shore. Gleaming black and white against impossibly blue waters under a morning sun... loud inhalations and exhalations; 8 minutes of bliss. Photographed from shore. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
