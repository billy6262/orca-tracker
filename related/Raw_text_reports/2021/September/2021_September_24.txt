Center for Whale Research Encounter #79: "… The team arrived on scene at
11:16 south of
Blunden [Islet] with the T65Bs, T36s, along with T65A5
. They had apparently just finished a kill, and were milling in a tight group and being quite social, with lots of surface active behaviors. At least one whale had parts of a prey item in its mouth, although its not clear from our photographs whether this is a seal or a porpoise. The whales started slowly trending northeast…" [See CWR Encounter #79 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-79
