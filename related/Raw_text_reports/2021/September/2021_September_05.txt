14:42, the team left Snug and headed north towards Boundary Pass. The team arrived on scene with the whales south of East Point at
15:26. The whales were very spread out, and headed down Boundary Pass. Several small groups were close to shore, with other groups and singles spread well across the pass. â€¦" [See CWR Encounter #63 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-63 for full summary and more photos]
