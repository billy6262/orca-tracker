A beautiful procession of the Southern Residents through rain that turned into mist and then ribbons of fog at the surface of the sea. Moving in and out of the fog, the orcas were beautiful, dark against the white and grey. I saw J56 Tofino close to her Mom J31 Tsuchi. Then a long line of orcas appeared including
J57 Phoenix with his Mom J35 Tahlequah
. Stretched out in a perfect line they moved in unison. A full hour later, bringing up the rear,
J26 Mike

Center for Whale Research Encounter #70: "… The team arrived on scene with whales near Turn Point at
14:44. Initially, they found a few spread out whales, including
members of J and K pod
. After a brief look at
K44, J35, and J57
, they followed
K42 and J47
for a while as they made their way south. A bit later, they were able to parallel
K26
to get right side photo identification shots. The team then briefly encountered
J36
, before moving to a large male they had sighted offshore. This large male turned out to be
L87
, a whale they had seen in previous encounters but had not gotten a chance to get clear ID shots of. The team paralleled the whale for some time, during which he did a large cartwheel followed by an impressive breach. …" [See CWR Encounter #70 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-70 for full summary and photo]

Sat, Sept 11 -
Penn Cove to Anacortes (T37As) - ~

16:00 -
We had the most incredible experience. They made a kill close to shore off Anacortes and the homeowner let us in his yard to watch. It was amazing! They are currently right next to the oil refinery.
---- I caught up with the T37As as they
headed east out of Penn Cove
past Monroe Landing. They continued east then north following the Whidbey shore. I saw them at the Borgman Road beach access, then Ala Spit, then at Deception Pass Bridge as they continued west. They then turned north up Rosario until Washington Park, at which point they turned east into Guemes Channel. They pushed closer to shore as they traveled east and popped up RIGHT off the Guemes ferry slip. …I thought, to the Cap Sante lookout and hope they come around the corner. But at the T intersection to go right, my gut said 'go left!' I'd never been this way before, but why not! We ended up on a dead-end circle, got out of the car, and you could hear their blows. I spotted them RIGHT in front of the house we parked at. They were circling on a hunt. The owner of that home came out onto the deck and I yelled at him "they're below you!" Then, he shocked us all by offering us to come onto his gorgeous property so we could get closer looks at the 37As. Seriously, this guy is my hero and I cannot thank him enough for giving us the best views. They indeed did continue east and we watched them from the Cap Sante lookout as they circled by the refinery and parked oil tanker before heading northeast. -Rachel Haight

16:45 -
What I think were the T37A's spotted first off
Washington Park
heading East in Guemes Channel. The group of 4, 2 females, a bull and a calf, were travelling and I caught up with them in front of Randy's Pier 66 Restaurant where they were very active and seemed to be on the hunt. Lots of up and down, rolling, spy hopping, and after about 20 minutes they all went down fast and made a big wave with lots of bubbles coming up. One of the females came out of the water and porpoised back in very quickly. I think they made a kill as they stayed under for a bit. I left them by Cap Sante as they were traveling again and heading East toward the refinery This was today @ about

14:05 -
From Light House Point looking at
Deception Pass Bridg
e. Lots of boats just waiting for the pod to exit under the bridge with one big whale watching Boat following behind. For some reason a boat came out from behind the whale watching boat in a big hurry, the whale watching boat gave a long loud toot from its horn as the speeding boat came up and cut off many other boats and never slowed down. Sadly, the pod went down deep, so we lost track of them. After a few minutes the pod did pop back up but in a hurry. -Desiree Sauve
