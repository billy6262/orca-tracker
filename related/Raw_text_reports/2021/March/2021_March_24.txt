13:44 - [orcas] Just cleared Point Robinson
, grouped up, stealthy travel mode steady
northbound
, mid channel but closer to mainland. Very choppy seas, hard to spot! ----Yay for springtime whales! It's been a spell since the T65a's have been here, it was so lovely to finally see them yesterday after seeing only fins in the distance for days. Here's the Point Robinson pass, didn't think they would come all the way in, as they were way over by the Des Moines Marina, disappeared completely for 15 minutes, then
T65A2 rose out of nowhere
close to the point as a cargo tanker rolled through. Didn't manage to get the others, only Artemis and little Callisto as they swam nearby, but, watching Ooxjaa skulk the shoreline was pretty darn sweet, he was so quiet and methodical. Never fails to be so impressed by them, what a beautiful family! -Marla Smith
