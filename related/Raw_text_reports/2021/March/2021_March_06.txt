I believe that they have all
passed Land Bank
heading back south now. 1445. (I viewed them at Land Bank. During the northbound pass there was a group extremely close to shore, as well as some spread further offshore. On the southbound pass they were further offshore. It did appear that they went up to Lime Kiln and then turned south, however since I was viewing from Land Bank the distance could have been distorted.) -Cassie Barclay

Center for Whale Research Encounter #10: "… Northern Haro Strait was lumpy and we bounced our way south until we saw our first
whales off Deadman Bay at 1410
. Since it looked like they were entering the park we decided to wait for them where we were near Bellevue Point. Except they never showed up. We drifted south a little with the ebbing tide and figured out the lead whales had turned around and were now heading down island. We putted south and found the group again off Land Bank almost a half hour after we had first seen them. They were milling a little and were briefly pointed north again before continuing down island not far off the shoreline. All the J19s plus J35 and J58 were traveling together in a tight group.
J57 and J58
were doing a lot of rolling and splashing and there was a half breach from one of the adults. About ten minutes later the group was joined by
J47
coming from offshore. We left this group
off Hannah Heights
and moved down island toward Kanaka Bay and found
J37 and J49
laying at the surface together. They had a salmon and were rolling and being tactile with one another while they shared their fish. …" [See CWR Encounter #10 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-10

17:50-

18:28 - 14+ members of J-pod
returning from the south and heading back north again until out of sight,
1/2 mile south of Land Bank
. I could positively ID J35 Tahlequah with both
J57 Phoenix and J47 Notch
(who is really getting big);
J19 Shachi, J38 Cookie and J26 Mike
. One of the calves, I think J57, executed an impressive leap out of the water.

15:45 - 4-5 members returning from the south
milling with no direction, 1/2 mile south of Land Bank. They slowly drift south again.

14:12-

14:55 -
Changing direction with some milling and fish chasing. They headed south until out of sight, reportedly all the way to
Eagle Cove
.

3:40-

14:00 - 10+ members of J-pod northbound 1/2 mile south of Land Bank Westside Preserve
. Small groups spread out, the orcas barely broke the surface and moved ever so slowly and gracefully. One fluke wave and a few easy rolls but mostly they were content to drift. So peaceful to watch. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Only photo we got of the
gray that was feeding in Mariners Cove
. Then he cut across towards Harrington Lagoon/Long Pt. area where we could see a second gray feeding. 3/6 at
12:40 pm. (Photo is the top of its back, heading away from us. It was the best we could do with the conditions.) -Terra and Greg Parham
*

16:50 -
I'm seeing puffs straight out from
Mariners Cove
right now (
4:50pm) heading north, but fairly far out (i.e., not cruising the beach). I'd love to get you a photo but it's so far out and pops up in random spots so I never know where to zoom.

12:00 -
Thanks to some alert neighbors, we're watching a gray that cruised south past
Mariners Cove
and has been feeding at the happy meal mudflats for the past 20-30 minutes. It is super hard to see with the waves and wind today, but I catch a spout every few minutes. -Marianne Parry

. 3/6/2021 at
12:40. (Upon reaching Camano Head, Captain Carl found us another whale! It turned out to be #44 Dubknuck who was spotted for the first time this season. Dubknuck was unfortunately heading north and so after a brief viewing, we had to say goodbye.) -Tyson Parker Reed
