right off the seawall in Langley
.

David Freed called back, to update on the one gray. Is now headed southeast down the channel. Last time saw whale spout
200 yards offshore off Inn at Langley
. Others said they saw a couple of others. This is the only whale I've seen moving. Exciting they are back.

David Freed called to report seeing his first
gray whale in Saratoga Passage up north past Langley
about 1/2 mile where 3 houses are. Just saw spout from a distance so don't have sense of direction so far. Whale is on the Langley side of Saratoga. Very exciting. -David Freed

Currently 1 grey? feeding approximately
1 mile WSW of Port of Everett
. (long down times). -Kim Peterson

As we cruised along, we passed a marker buoy full of cormorants and not long after that one of our passengers found our first whale. After we dialed it in, we realized there was actually a second whale in the area as well, feeding on the shallows just on the
south end of Hat Island
. The first whale we found was CRC#2259 and he gave us some good looks and the second whale we found was unidentifiable for the time being. Both whales seemed to have just finished feeding and had switched to napping mode and so after many great looks we continued on to search for more. Land based reports from Langley's shore line brought us to the north and with a little help from our friends we were able to find the reported animals. It turned out to be four of our Sounders and they were all traveling south, together very quickly. We got some amazing looks at this group as they were traveling and were not hesitating to show off their tail flukes. We were able to figure out that it was
#53 Little Patch, #723 Lucy"fer", #21 Shackleton, and #531
. It was so amazing to see all four whales traveling and socializing with each other! -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
*

12:30 - #383
passed the rest of the group and continued north up Saratoga Passage while the other 4 are continuing south at
12:30.

12:17 -
MV Saratoga is on scene with 5 gray whales just
south of Langley heading south
. We have
531, 723, 21, 53, and 383
all socializing together! ----On yesterday's gray whale trip, guests on the Saratoga were treated to encounters with 6 different individual gray whales including
newbie CRC2249
, as well as returning Sounders
CRC383, CRC531, CRC53 "Little Patch", CRC723 "Lucyfer", and perhaps most excitingly CRC21 "Shackleton"
. This was our first encounter with Shackleton this season and he was in a social group of 4 whales all swimming closely together. It's great to see CRC21 back in Puget Sound and healthy enough to keep up with a rambunctious group, especially given his old tail injury. Shackleton has a telltale scar at the base of his tail flukes that was likely caused by a past entanglement in fishing gear. He was lucky enough to free himself sometime before he was first documented by Cascadia Research Collective in 1990. Likely as a result of this old injury, Shackleton rarely ever lifts his tail flukes out of the water like other gray whales will. His scars may also explain why CRC21 is usually the last of our Sounders to arrive each season, as it may cause him to swim a little slower than the others. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express
