----I have no idea what
J Pod
was doing today, other than taking the kids for an island tour. I spent 3 hours waiting at Point Caution in the freezing wind, while they circumnavigated Shaw Island, visited West Sound, and traveled down Wasp Passage, then headed north - in the opposite direction from where I was. Fortunately, I made it to Reuben Tarte in time for a beautiful close pass. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

Sat, Mar 27 - Deception Pass and Rosario Strait - While I was at the [Deception Pass] bridge, I also got a text message from Trevor Derie (who's helping Garry with CPSMMSN) that there was
a gray about half a mile off of Green Point at Washington Park
, heading toward Burrows. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network

I'm standing in the middle of
Deception Pass Bridge
facing west, and there is
one individual gray whale
that's been circling roughly 400 yards off the south side of the park, and about 300 yards off the bridge. Long down times 3-6 minutes, no fluking. I have some photos but glare is making it tough. -Amanda Colbert, Orca Network

Entry 5:
22:15 -
I was just taking the old-lady dog out for a late-night potty attempt (very old, sloooooow pug), and was thrilled to hear some very heavy breathing over by the Happy Meal Mudflats!! It was
10:15pm so I couldn't see anything, but I think there
may have been two grays based
on the quickness of the breaths, and they were close enough that I could hear the inhale very clearly, which is always simply magical. They were slowly moving south,
in the direction of Polnell
. So nice to hear those familiar greetings in the darkness once again! -Marianne Parry

â€¦We continued on after that and soon found ourselves on scene with the
first gray whale
of the day. It ended up being
CRC 2259
and we got to spend a bit of time with him as he circled the waters on the
south end of Hat island
. From there we began to head north but changed course to the east when we found
a gray whale feeding in the Snohomish river delta
. Once on scene we found out that it was actually two gray whales feeding in the delta both of which we have yet to identify. As we followed the whales they lead us to the day marker of the river delta where we found two bald eagles, on mature and one immature. We stuck around for a little while longer with the feeding grays before heading out toward Hat island to find more wildlife. It did not take long before we were on scene with #53 Little Patch. LP gave us some great looks and was very cooperative as he headed toward Hat Island. So it was time to head back in and as we passed the Naval ship yard, we realized that our whales from the delta was now just outside the Navy's fence. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
