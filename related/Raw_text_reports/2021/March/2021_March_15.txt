Spotted whale in middle of Dabob Bay going south. It was breaching completely out of the water. It went as far south as Wawa Point, then turned North along the shore, toward Jackson Cove. It breached the surface along Wawa Point, exposing the tail, but never came out of the water completely in the shallows. Early afternoon saw whale near Pulali Point heading SW toward Wawa Point, blowing and surfacing. Spotted it several more times throughout the day going back and forth through Dabob Bay. -Cynthia Canfield

Mon, Mar 15 - Southern Saratoga Passage - As we headed out toward Hat island Captain Carl found us our first whale just
outside the Snohomish river delta
. With shallow surfacing and very light exhalations it was clear that this whale was enjoying the beautiful day and taking a nice little nap, but we were able to identify this whale as
#185
. Our friends to the north had found another animal in Saratoga pass and we were headed that way when captain Carl found
another whale just off of Camano Island
. It turned out to be
CRC#2259
and he gave us some great looks and even showed off his large white patch which resembles that of
gray whale #49
. While we hung out with him we began to see blows in the distance, quickly approaching our area. Soon we had two whales around us and we were able to get a solid ID on the second one as
#383
. After getting some tail shots and close activity from the whales we headed back to the delta to see if our friend from earlier had woken up. Unfortunately, it seemed to have left the area and so we once again joined 2259 and 383! After another great show from the whales, we had to begin making our way back to the dock. Before we got there however, we found two more gray whales feeding in the Snohomish river delta. It was difficult to get an ID shot one these whales as they had quite small surfacings. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
