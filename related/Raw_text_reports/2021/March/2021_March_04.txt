Saw a group from the fishing pier in Edmonds. SO AWESOME!! -Nicole Schleich Abbott
*

15:05 -
Amazingly close in
off Mukilteo on a kill
. So close! They then headed east; I moved but haven't seen them again so maybe they back-tracked?

14:30 - Right off Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach
making directional changes. Possibly hunting. added: Earlier around
14:30, the Ts made it to Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach, stalled and began making directional changes right off the beach south of the boat launch. After a few minutes, it was clear they had prey. They moved closer to shore and continued circling, tail lobbing, etc. At one point, the water was "boiling". The predation went on for many minutes as they drifted slowly north and even closer to shore all the way up to the boat launch. Super cool close in spyhop.
T124A2s
grouped and turned away from shore;
T87
turned right towards shore and us humans, but then he clearly circled under water; he surfaced heading away towards the others. They were, at that point, off the lighthouse still so close to shore headed northeast, went on a dive and have not seen them again. Humans were freaking out and celebrating this encounter in the best way. One of the most excellent encounters of a lifetime. Not sure where those Ts went.

13:20 -
They've come out of Browns Bay and continued northbound close to shore, currently just north of Picnic Point Beach. Heading towards Mukilteo.

12:56 -
Moving towards shore, same location

12:50 - Pod is off north Edmonds
, approximately out from Haines Wharf heading northbound while moving inshore and offshore, but still steady northbound. Looks good for continuing towards Possession Sound but just a bit too soon to say for certain. (Definitely not heading Admiralty) They are still together, but slightly spread.

12:25 - Pod came close in off Edmonds Marina Beach
rounded the jetty and moved a bit offshore. Currently north of ferry dock, still this side of channel heading steady northbound, loosely grouped. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network video - https://youtu.be/CYnLde4nJmA

Here's a picture from
Marina Beach Park
at
12:12. It's my first time seeing orcas in the wild and had my 2 toddlers with me so I'm happy to get one picture as evidence it was real life. -Stefanie Scott

12:09 - [orcas] Passing Marina Beach, Edmonds
, long down times. -Janine Harles

Right in front of me at the dog park headed straight for the ferry line. 5 came through close in to a
Edmonds beach
. -Melissa Atchison
*

10:41 - [orcas]
Just saw them off
Carkeek
. Still northbound. I think they were feeding on something as they kind of circled around for the last 30 minutes. Now have moved further north. I'd say they were east of mid channel. -Matty Leaman
*

10:06 - Golden Gardens headed north

10:06. Longish down times I think. -Emily Peterson

08:00 -
We just saw
killer whales from the West Seattle ferry
. they were in Elliot Bay, heading north, around
8:00 this morning, crew saw around seven, very spread out, at least one male. They were pretty spread out but fairly close to downtown. The ferry took a big right turn to avoid them. -Elizabeth Petras
*

Entry 3:
Holmes Harbor - ~

13:10 -
Today at approximately
1:10p.m., I spotted two blows from a single animal heading south near the
Freeland Park
. The whale was on the east side of the harbor and surfaced 2-3 while turning to head north. Last sighting at approximately
1:20 pm was of a dive with a nice display of flukes. This occurred right in front of my house located on East Harbor Road, so very close to the park. Could not take pictures. -Catherine Drews

13:38 -
Surfaced in
Holmes Harbor
again further north, east side of harbor in line with the golf course. Fluke has a white patch on its top right side.

12:59 - Gray whale in Holmes Harbor by Freeland Park
. Just saw a fluke near the anchored sailboats. Too quick to get a picture. -Cindy Bowen
