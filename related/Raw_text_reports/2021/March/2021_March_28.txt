11:17-

11:24 - 1/2 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve
, increasing rain arrived with a southbound group of 4-5 (I think 4) including 2 calves and 2-3 females. Tentatively identified as
J46 Star, J53 Kiki, J35 Tahlequah and J57 Phoenix
, they were moving quickly but then stalled in front of me milling and changing direction. There was a tail wave not a slap, a spy hop and many times I saw faces peering above the surface. J35 and J46 demonstrated strong and flashy porpoising. The group stayed tight, dove deep and I didn't see them again. In my last visual they were trending north approximately 1/2 mile south of Landbank.

11:07-

11:11 - 1/2 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve

came past quickly with a single sighting of a third orca. Hard to see because of rain. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 2:
Northern California
Yesterday, 28 Mar, a pod was seen traveling north about 1-2 mi off the beach, here is the story I've pieced together.
1. HSU Avian Ecologist Frank Fogarty was watching a loon via spotting scope off of Mal'el dunes beach (about latitude 40.867) when an Oo surfaced in the background (yeah, WOW!), around
1230
. He saw large rafts of scoters, about 125 loons, 75 common murres and 20 marbled murrelets, about maybe 6 sea lions, frequent harbor porpoise (maybe 10 in the area, milling about), all of them feeding on something past the breakers.
The Oo [Orcinus orca] came in fast from the south
, slowed and milled, circling in an area "100s of yards across", then they moved offshore, returned and circled again, went offshore again then back further north, circled, then went north about 1.5 mi offshore. He saw one big male and about 5 others. The male tail lobbed 3-4 times (upright, dorsal still visible), heads were lifted out of the water, some splashing, difficult to see from the beach. (I forgot to ask about reactions by the porpoise and birds, which were further inshore, away from the main action - …Frank estimated 6 individuals, including the one tall male.
2. After an hour watching them Frank posted the sighting on our local birders alert network, Gary Friedrichsen called me (as David Orluck and Elias Elias texted), sent me a text with Frank's number, I jumped into truck and headed to Mal'el dunes. I called Frank when I got to the parking lot at 1348 only to learn the whales were north where two other local birders were scanning, so I headed back north.
3. At 1405 Rob Fowler informed me that Greg Gray was
seeing them from the vista overlook at the mouth of the Mad River
(40.9748 -124.1175). I joined Greg and via his scope saw them 1.5-2 mi out moving slow in a line abreast. The big male was on the left, then a tall female or sprouting male, then 3-4 medium to juve sized dorsals, and a Mc pair on the right end, for a count of low 6 to high 8. The dorsal fins looked more falcate than pointy, too far to make out any open saddles, the big male may have bent left a bit at top. The pod was heading toward Trinidad head, I left to prepare to look from there, by 1445 I was ready, Dave Orluck had replaced Greg at the vista point and was still seeing them heading west offshore. By the time I got back they were too far for me to see with my scope, but Dave was still seeing them, in smaller groups, not all lined up as before. The wind picked up and home we went.
In May I'll retrieve the NOAA buoy mooring with the three autonomous recorders, request that 28 March be analyzed first. The buoy (4 nmi offshore) is 14.5 naut mi south from where Frank saw them, the Oo would have passed by.
K-Pod versus Transients? What SRKW pod fits this configuration? -Jeff Jacobsen

Entry 3:
Snohomish River delta
. It seemed quite fitting that the whale we were able to hang out with today was
CRC 723 "Lucifer"
as he made his way through the waves toward the shallow waters. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
