…thought the whales were all staying south of Mariners Cove. However, one lone boat is out mid-channel between Mariners Cove and Maple Grove Beach, and I can see what I'm guessing are three orcas - one big straight fin and two mediums.

About halfway down the Camano Island shoreline,
north of Cama Beach
, we came across the
T46 family of Bigg's killer whales
! This is a very special family, led by mom
T46 Wake
, believed to have been born around 1966. Wake and her four kids were spread out, leisurely making their way north. We got some particularly good looks at
T46E Thor
who was born in 2003. He's huge! T46 has such a special story. In 1976, she was one of 6 whales that were captured in Puget Sound to be transported to aquariums. Due to public outcry, the whales were released, and we are so thankful that they were, because Wake went on to have more than 20 children and grandchildren! We were lucky to have the privilege to spend the afternoon with these orcas before heading home, back through Deception Pass. -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

Leading male heading north in Saratoga Passage on Camano side as, seen from above Sandy Point.

10:25 - Orcas straight out from Sandy Point
heading toward mid channel. At least 3.
----It was an early morning dash to Sandy Point, Langley, to catch the T46s entering Saratoga Passage, prior to their crossing closer to Camano Island and continuing north. The orcas were split into two groups with three leaders and a couple of trailers lagging behind, and with the rain impairing visibility, we weren't sure who we were seeing. A closer inspection of images revealed
T46D
born 2000, confirming that once again we were in the presence of the legendary matriarch T46 (Wake), who survived the last capture in Washington State in 1976, and family (photo Richard Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard

Entry 6:
~

17:15 -
I saw a whale, I think, looked small with a small dorsal fin on the back breach twice in the
Gorst Inlet
around
5:15 today! Definitely a dorsal hook (I looked at your pictures of the humpback vs gray). It didn't look big, maybe a baby? It was all the way down past the PSNS ships in the Gorst inlet. I was driving down the highway along the shoreline and saw it surface right after it sprayed out of its blow hole. Super excited to see it. I actually think I saw another this morning, early, coming down from Sequim while going over the
Hood Canal Bridge
. I saw that one surface also and saw the same type of dorsal hump but at that time I thought it was a porpoise because it was so quick.... now I think it was the same kind of whale. -Holly Baker
