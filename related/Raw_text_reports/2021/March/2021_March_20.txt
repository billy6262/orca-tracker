Entry 3:
Skagit Bay
- We saw two pairs of bald eagles on Hope Island, and another pair on a nearby channel marker. It wasn't long after when we felt Captain Shane slow the boat and announce that he had found A WHALE! This whale was almost immediately recognized as a well-known Sounder,
#44 "Dubknuck".
He was so relaxed and just cruising the shallows, likely feeding based on the bird activity above. Everyone onboard also learned that YES, you can still get the life-changing experience of smelling stinky whale breath through a mask! It was...enlightening to say the least! We were so lucky to find Dubknuck in the calm lee of Whidbey Island, but we wanted to continue on the search to find more whales and wildlife! -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures (Anacortes)

----
14:00 trip: We then made our way out to
Hat Island
where we found
gray whale #531
as she was traveling around the shallows off the southern end of the island. After some deep dives and some awesome looks at her flukes, we headed to the north toward Port Susan. Just off the north east side of Hat Island, captain Carl found us two more gray whales. They turned out to be #21 "Shackleton" and #383 as they were socializing and traveling through the deep waters. #383 showed us his flukes a few times and both he and Shackleton gave us some great looks. -Tyson Parker Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching

Entry 6:
10:00 trip - We then pushed out into Port Gardner and headed north toward
Port Susan
. After passing Tulalip Bay, we came on scene with
CRC #531
as she was feeding in the shallow waters just off shore. We got to see a whole lot of great feeding action and hung out with 531 for some time as she headed south. As she was traveling, she even showed her flukes on a few of her deeper dives. After a while we split off to find some more wildlife around Camano Island. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
