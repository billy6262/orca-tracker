Orca Sightings for March 13, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
15:52 - Gray whale feeding off Mabana Bluffs
on Camano side. -Steve Brown

The afternoon started out just as lovely as the morning with warm sunshine beaming down on us. We got wonderful looks at a sea lion snoozing on a channel marker and then headed south for the afternoon in response to a report we got from a friend of a
gray whale coming into Possession Sound
. This was an exciting prospect, as a whale coming up from the south might be a new arrival for the season. We were expecting to see some familiar flukes from one of the dozen "Sounders", but much to our surprise and delight, it was a whale not in the catalog! After reaching out to Cascadia Research Collective, this whale was identified as
#2249
. Funny enough, Island Adventures DID see this whale once in
April 2019. Welcome back, 2249! We watched until 2249 headed into waters too shallow for us near the Snohomish River delta and then traveled north in search of more wildlife. -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)

Captain Trevor from Puget Sound Express spotted an inbound
gray whale near Possession Point around
1:25 pm
that appears like a newbie. Here are a couple of photos. Pics have been sent in to Cascadia. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

Entry 2:
15:50 -
This is far away, so just a data point for you - there's
a gray by Camano coming up to Utsalady
from the south. -Marianne Parry
*

12:02 -
At Maple Grove boat launch and can see a
gray off of Polnell Point
. -Kevin Doar
*
Soon we joined
gray whale #56 near Polnell Point
and after a little while we were able to really get in sync with his surfacing. He even gave us a great look at his tail flukes on a deep dive. We then headed over to Oak harbor and found
Dubknuck #44
doing some feeding before he began to venture out into the deeps. It was a great time with gray whales and soon we decided to head back out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca to search for more wildlife. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
*

11:55 - Gray whale CRC44, Dubknuck
is just
south of Oak Harbor
. (He was just milling out there.) -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express
*

08:53 - A gray
came cruising up from the south here at
Mariners Cove
, appeared to be in a hurry, but then made a sharp u-turn and went right back to the Happy Meal mudflats for a quick bite. It changed direction a few times, which was a little unusual, but then vanished completely, so I'm guessing it was relocating further down the beach toward Polnell. -Marianne Parry
*
We had a visitor swim through our neighborhood waters (
Polnell Point
) this morning! (Unfortunately, I didn't get any decent pics of its body. Using deductive reasoning, it was probably Dubknuck we saw. It was definitely moving along at a fairly rapid clip. It wasn't lingering in one spot very long.) -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA

Entry 3:
14:15 - Left gray, s/he north of Bells Beach
and in line with Mabana Shores, Whidbey side, southbound at the time.

13:00 -
Watching
gray from mid Baby Island Heights
high bank. LOS with Camano State Park. Just this side of mid channel (Whidbey) traveling southbound.----Watched gray whale 3/13/2021, actually saw 2 different blows out from me towards
Camano/Elger Bay
area. I was able to keep my eye on tho, from around noon until
1:30. It was lowish tide, so she was kind of milling, hanging, moving southbound slowly, sometimes directional changes, she was heading towards Camano at one point, then I see her coming towards me. She did, came and did a close "drive by" and again, there went my heart. -Marilyn Armbruster
