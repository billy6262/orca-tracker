Orca Sightings for March 18, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
16:50 - Two grays
are spouting mid-channel,
south of Mariners Cove
! It's a little hard to tell where they're heading, but def south, maybe coming across toward Polnell. One has a much bigger puff than the other - volcano vs cotton ball. (Update on our two gray friends: they have split up and one is slowly heading north toward Utsalady. The other one is still parked in front of Maple Grove Beach but appears to be very gradually heading south. They both seem close to Camano from my viewpoint here on Whidbey, but are more likely mid-channel-ish.) Marianne Parry
