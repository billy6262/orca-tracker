----It took a little while to identify who we were looking at in
Saratoga Passage
today, after briefly seeing an adult male close to shore off Fox Spit then seeing another male (or was it the same one?) soon afterwards with a group of orcas further out. Another tall dorsal fin appearing from the left as the group of four headed south towards Langley, on the Whidbey side, added to the mystery. All was revealed after watching and photographing the whales from Langley, albeit that they had moved closer to the Camano side. The well-known
T46s
, including the legendary matriarch
T46
who was in the last live capture in Budd Inlet and who was released before SeaWorld was thrown out of Washington State, were accompanied by lone male,
T87
, recently seen traveling with the T124A2s. As the saying goes, variety is the spice of life (photos Richard Snowberger, zoomed and cropped). -Sandra Pollard
