Center for Whale Research Encounter #15: "
â€¦T49A1
passed us heading quickly north in the direction the lead group of whales had originally been traveling before they began milling. We had one more quick pass with the
T10s, T63, and T65
while they traveled north-northwest near the border before heading off to look for the lead group again. We eventually found them at 1445 off the
west end of Spieden Island
. This was the
T36As and the T49As (minus T49A2 and T49A3 who were not present today)
in a tight group.
T49A1 had joined them
and they had finally slowed down as they traveled past the entrance to Reid Harbor and along the Stuart Island shoreline. We ended the encounter at 1503 about a half mile southeast of Tiptop Hill on Stuart Island. Once we got home and looked at our photos we realized that
T68B1 and T68B1A were also mixed in with the T71s.
These two brought the
total number of whales photographed this day to 21
from the
T10, T36A, T49A, T65, T68B1, and T71 groups.

11:25 - Gray whale 2356
is back!! South of Camano Head right now. See computer screen shot for a pic.
----Two more
gray whales
have come in from the ocean to join our "Sounders". Today our boats from Port Townsend and Edmonds found two returning "newbie" gray whales that might have come in with the rough seas from Sunday's wind storm.
CRC 2356
was the first returning newcomer we spotted today, associating with veteran sounder
CRC44, Dubknuck
. 2356 was first documented in Puget Sound in 2020 and he spent much of the summer feeding at the Snohomish River Delta. Later we spotted another returning newcomer, CRC2255, hanging out with
CRC53, Little Patch
.
CRC2255
was first seen in our area in 2019. This is exciting news that more of our "newbies" from 2019 and 2020 are returning for some springtime feeding in the sound. This should bring our number of gray whales that have shown up this year to about 14 now! -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

between
Hat and Camano Island, 1130.
