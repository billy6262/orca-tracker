Entry 4:
Haro and out into the Strait of Juan de Fuca
where we found whales! Captain Carl saved the day, finding not one but
three minke whales
! We spent our time with the friendliest of the bunch as it meandered Hein Bank. Every once and a while we'd catch glimpses of its peers off in the distance. The sunny skies, smooth seas, and views of both mountain ranges made for truly ideal minke spotting conditions. â€¦Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
