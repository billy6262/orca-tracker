What a great morning! At
9:40 AM Sunday,
April 11th, A fast moving
pod of orcas heading south
. At least 3 of them. North of
Clinton Ferry Terminal
. Close to shore of Clinton. I've been seeing gray whales almost every other day, past week, but this is a first for us to see the Orcas. (We are new this year to Whidbey Island and Washington.) I was so surprised to see how fast they are. No time to even get camera ready. I yelled so loud to inform my family; I think I also informed all our neighbors. -John Shackman
*

09:30 -
Good morning! Just spotted at least
4 orcas southbound between Hat Island and Clinton
(closer to west side of Hat). Saw splashes, blows and white undersides! -Tabitha Jacobs-Mangiafico
*

09:15 -
My boyfriend and I saw a pod of orcas traveling south between the east side of Whidbey (just
north of the Mukilteo ferry
) and the
west side of Hat Island
this morning. There were at least 6 orcas that we spotted from a bluff on Hat Island. It's very clam and there were no boats around. Please let me know if you have any questions - this is my first orca sighting and report. Thanks! -Sarah Sadid
*

Entry 2:
E. Strait of Juan de Fuca
- It's not too often that we get lucky enough to see gray whales in our neck of the woods. They typically spend the spring months around Whidbey Island foraging for ghost shrimp. Gray whale sightings around San Juan Island happen about once a year. Prior to casting off from the dock we heard of a possible
gray whale
spotted from shore near Salmon Bank so we chose to head south. As we were sailing out of
Cattle Pass
we spotted the heart shaped blow and knew we found the gray whale. Unfortunately, the gray whale was very skinny and not looking too good… -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*

13:35 - Gray whale is heading north through Cattle Pass
. -Alissa Elderkin
*

13:35 -
Now 4 min dives and fluking, seems to be feeding in the area.

13:15 - Gray whale
still near Salmon Bank east of marker, 3-4 breaths per dive and taking 6+ min dives. -Laura Cupicha
*

08:20 -
Oh! I just saw it... very cose to the
Salmon Bank
marker!! -Erin Corra
*

8:00 - Gray whale off Salmon Bank
, near the buoy. Doesn't appear to be traveling. (We didn't see a dorsal and we saw the blow from a different angle about
8:30, looked heart-shaped) Stephanie Reiss

Entry 3:
Port Susan
- This evening's trip started under beautiful blue skies and rather good sea conditions. We headed down Jetty island and made our first stop at the naval base to view a big group of California sea lions. After that we headed out into Port Gardner and found our first whale feeding in on the Snohomish river delta. While we watched the whale feeding in the shallows another whale snuck up on us and surfaced right next to the boat! It turned out to be
CRC#2247
and it was headed into the shallows to join the other whale we had started with. We decided to branch off to search for more at that time and heading into Port Susan Captain Carl found us and adult bald eagle out doing some fishing. We made the turn after that and searched the mainland shores for more feeding gray whales and were able to rejoin
CRC#2246
as it was quickly heading north. This time 2246 showed off its chewed up tail flukes a couple times and was clearly taking advantage of the shallowing feeding opportunities. -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
*
Port Susan Whale Watchers are reporting
3 grays off Country Club Beach
1 and 2 on Camano Island and spouts for what appears to be 2 Grays passing Kayak Point heading towards Warm Beach on the Snohomish County side of Port Susan. -John C. Storbeck
*

Entry 4:
Central Puget Sound -

18:48 -
Friends texted me that she's seeing a lone whale near
Beach Drive heading south
. She's unsure what type of species it is. Said spout is huge, but long downtimes so hard to guess when it'll pop back up - maybe the gray from earlier?? -Shelly Short
*
Maija Holston, WSF Marine Ops, emailed with gray whale sighting: Reported by SUQUAMISH, 1745 Master reports a
gray whale due west of Duwamish Head
on the east side of the north traffic lanes.
*

12:53 - Gray whale
is now off
Kayu Kayu Ac Park
heading northbound close in, just south of Pt. Wells. (update: I was able to match this Shoreline gray to the whale seen in Elliott Bay in the morning by Brittany Philbin.) -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

Entry 5:
Liberty Bay/Central Puget Sound - ~
09:00 & ~

13:00 - [gray]
We just moved to Lemolo in Poulsbo a few months ago, and just last weekend we had the pleasure of watching this whale enjoy Liberty Bay! This was seriously a highlight for 2021. (It was 4/11, we spotted it about
9:00 a.m. Watched it for an hour or so then went about our day. Spotted it again around
1:00 p.m. Couldn't believe it was still hanging around! We watched it head out of Liberty Bay but can't see much after the turn of the bay so don't know where it was headed after that.) -Marnie Clark
*

Entry 6:
Central Puget Sound/Liberty Bay -

10:26 - Liberty Bay, Poulsbo
. Some type of
whale
(not orca) in vicinity of Lemolo. Has surfaced 4-5 times with blow hole sprays a few times. Currently swimming around. Pretty amazing! -Karl Royston, Poulsbo, WA

Entry 7:
Central Puget Sound -

12:28 - Just saw whale spout by Richmond Beach Park
