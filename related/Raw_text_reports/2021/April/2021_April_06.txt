15:00-

16:30 -
There were
7-8 orcas in Henderson Bay
this afternoon. From my deck at about
15:00, I saw them attacking a harbor seal - lots of tail slapping and a poor seal trying to catch its breath. I went to my kayak and when I got out there, they were probably feeding on it - there was an oily slick on the water and lots of gulls picking up pieces. Unfortunately, my camera batteries were dead, so I don't have pictures but there was one large male and a young male, a couple of juveniles and a few females. They slowly left the bay and I stopped following them around
16:30. -Tim Hoffnagle

15:00 - Orcas in Henderson Bay, Raft Island
, this afternoon
15:00. They were very active, playful, and (successfully) hunting seals. All images from our deck on the west side of Henderson Bay, looking east to Raft Island.----It has been a while, but finally, today, Orcas back in Henderson Bay. It was very exciting, first we had many seals right by our shore. We were wondering why they were all right at our shore. My husband said there is something out there that they are hiding from. It wasn't minutes later, when the first orcas appeared. And shortly after that, the hunt began! I just kept shooting, and send you some of the hunts! Hope you can see the bloody mess! ...The afternoon started with about 20 seals huddled right by our shore, around us maybe 100 seals! My husband knew and said: there is something bigger out there that they are all hiding from. And it was only minutes later when the first big splash appeared, then a few fins, and here they came. The battle was right in our view! -Ingrid Shumway

Was on my SUP this morning @ approx. 8am, saw
a huge orca breach off Pt. Robinson

Entry 3:
Oregon Coast -

15:28 -
Orca Network just received a call from Jim Border who observed northbound grays and believes a pod of
southbound orcas off Oceanside, Oregon
(believe he said Maxwell Mtn. ?). They first were watching several grays heading northbound a few miles offshore. Then into view came
no fewer than 1/2 dozen beasts
moving southbound 4-5 miles offshore. These whales had vertical black fins so was confident they were seeing pod of orcas. They watched for about 40 minutes as the orcas continued southbound. (They are docents at the center down there) -HG

GRAY WHALES - Tue, Apr 6 - Discovery Bay - While stargazing from the patio of our unit at the Worldmark resort in
Discovery Bay
tonight, we very clearly heard
a whale blow
repeatedly, no more than 100 yards from us. It was pitch dark so we couldn't see anything but I did get a video recording of the sound, which I'm attaching. The whale would come up for air and blow every 20-30 seconds for a few minutes and then dive for several minutes before coming up again. It stayed in roughly the same spot for about 20-30 minutes before gradually heading north. It seemed to be alone, as we didn't hear any other whales at all. -Adam Kidwell
*

12:36 - Whale, thought to be gray
almost all the way to the end
Discovery Bay
, just east of 101 and 20...The whale wasn't really heading in any direction. Just swimming around the same area he has been for a while. -Nancy Lindsey [PSWS]

----
April 6 found us with two 'old' Sounders,
CRC44 (Dubknuck) and CRC383
, industriously dredging together for ghost-shrimp close to shore at
Camp Diana, Camano Island
. The whales followed a steady pattern of feeding before returning to deep water and back to the shallows again as they meandered slowly north toward Elger Bay, attracting a host of birds, eager for scraps, in their wake. (Photos Sandra Pollard/Richard Snowberger, zoomed and cropped). photo - "
