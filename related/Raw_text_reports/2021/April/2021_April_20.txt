Orca Sightings for April 20, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (T49A3 and T90s)
- It was a beautiful, peaceful sail and we were reaching a favorite wildlife hot spot when we received a report of
orcas hunting in Deer Harbor
. It was a tricky call to change from our peaceful sail and motor sail against the ebb with a sliver of a chance we could catch up with the orcas. But we went for it and succeeded in meeting them in Spieden Channel. We heard that they were involved in a scuffle with four sea lions near Limestone Point. We had a good view as they wrapped around
Sentinel Island and hugged the Spieden coastline
and wrapped around to New Channel, our favorite place. The backlit blows and reflections in the fast moving still waters were magical. We left for a while to cut through the Cactus Islands seeing a river otter, a couple bald eagles and more seals. We could see the blows over the rocky reefs. Drifting on the ebb we passed the Steller sea lions at Green Point as did the orcas. They targeted a lone sea lion who received a number of powerful hits, but they left him to check out others near Limestone Point. We set course for home as they returned to Green Point once again. They were at Green Point the following day around noon. -Captains Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Entry 2:
North Puget Sound/Possession Sound -

18:00 - Saw about 6 orcas (outside Everett Marina),
at least one juvenile at 6pm tonight. Watched for about an hour and they stayed in the same area. Slowly moved west. We stayed pretty far away so you will probably have to zoom in a lot. -Tony Seaward
*

17:06 -
At
18:28 John Miller, WSF Marine Ops, emailed older report from 1706hrs: C/M reports

16:50 -
3 spouts (
orcas
?) mid channel between

18:15/

18:30 -
We spotted
orcas just north of the Murden Cove area (Bainbridge)
yesterday [4/20] early evening around
6:15/
6:30pm. I would guess there were
at least 6-8
but it was hard to tell from far away. Definitely a few with smaller dorsal fins and at least one with a visibly much taller dorsal fin. We saw a few swimming close together and a few others farther from that group. I'm attaching a map of the area where we saw them and a couple videos-please excuse my excited gasping/cursing :) Truly incredible to see! -Kara Styles
*

17:08 - 2 orcas out from Shilshole - mid channel - heading south
. -Torrey Hall Volk
*

16:50 -
When I was at
Fay Bainbridge, I saw 4 maybe 5 orcas southbound
in a line. Time was
4:50. (update: Now that I'm home & looking at the pics, there appears to be 6. 1 leading, 3 or 4 in the middle, and a large male trailing. They were mid to east of the channel. I spotted them slightly north of the far north end of Fay Bainbridge. I was able to follow them with my camera until they were slightly south of me & then lost them. They were all facing south when I saw them last. Leisure pace.) -Tisa Annette
*

16:39 - Two guys have resumed southbound
travel for now.

16:30 - Joined Ariel at Richmond Beach, she guided my eye to the two orcas mid channel, out from
Carkeek/Fay Bainbridge
. Seeing blows, and noises, making directional changes. Look to be hunting while trending/drifting now northbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

16:17 - [orcas]
I saw them surface around mid-channel off of
Carkeek Park
and then dive again. Still
southbound
. -Kevin Green
*

15:47 - Two males southbound
midchannel. Line of sight is Edmonds to
Fay Bainbridge
. -Ariel Yseth
*

13:30 - Lone male transient killer whale southbound mid channel
from Point No Point. Possibly T77A but only got a quick look. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express
*

Entry 4:
Admiralty Inlet (pos. T65As) - ~

12:00 -
Heather Hoins called to report
orcas in Admiralty Inlet
. They live on south end of Marrowstone Island and saw a group of orcas (incl. male, 2-3 females, baby, and youth) heading
northbound quickly on the Marrowstone side
. They watched as the pod was heading up island then lost sight as they got towards the point.----These [photos] were taken from the Sound View Cemetery - they passed our house much closer (between Kinney Pt. and Liplip [Point]) - grabbed the camera and drove up to the cemetery hoping for a closer look - but as they swam up island, they went farther out towards the shipping lanes. Hope you can identify - the male had an interesting knob-like top to his dorsal.

Entry 5:
San Juan Islands -
Laura L. Baker, WSF Marine Ops, emailed to report: KALEETAN: Unknown Species in
Rosario
, 4/20 C/M, ANAC/SJI H, reports spotting a whale of unknown species, milling about 1 mile south of Reef Pt. [SW Cypress Island] [
alb informed was
CRC1364
]
*
...Just as we were leaving the minkes [around
Eastern Bank
], the crew spotted a prominent spout close by. It turned out to be
a gray whale
! â€¦ -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
*

Entry 6:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

19:00 -
7pm tonight, there was a really quick fly-by, so the gray gang must have sent a scout up to see if the goodies were ready. This was
a single gray
, and it came by southbound fairly close to the beach but progressed further toward mid-channel as it moved south. It waved a fin briefly and did very few spouts, so I only got a tiny bit of photo evidence...Marianne Parry
*

Entry 7:
19:00 -
Slowed down a bit, long dive down-times, heading north into Saratoga Passage.

18:50 -
Heading somewhat quickly north now, north of navigational buoy.

18:40 - Gray whale between Baby Island
and navigational buoy, heading south towards Baby Island. -Martha Sinclair
*

12:50 - CRC 21 and 56 feeding at edge of Snohomish delta
. -Tyson Parker Reed
*

12:13 -
They [
531 and 383
] are moving at a leisurely pace. Not even with Langley Marina quite yet but heading that direction. Still mid-channel. -Luanne Seymour
*

12:01 -
Cruising north a little closer to mid channel now. Should be near downtown
Langley
in 10-15 minutes at this pace...unless there is a direction change or snack break! -Christy Grant
*

11:37 - 531 and 383
have rounded Camano Head and are heading up
Saratoga Passage
. Currently in line with
Langley
but closer to Camano. -Justine Buckmaster
*

11:06 - CRC 531 and 383
heading from Camano toward
Hat Island
. -Tyson Parker Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
*

Entry 8:
Port Susan -

11:37 - #44 Dubknuck
continuing steadily north along east side of Camano.---- #44 (Dubknuck) rolling north along the east shore of Camano Island, probably heading for his favorite feeding grounds in Port Susan, on a calm, quiet morning (photo zoomed and cropped). We thought we spotted one other whale earlier some way ahead but, as time and tide waits for no man, we had to return to Langley and weren't able to explore further. -Sandra Pollard
*

11:19 - CRC 44
headed up Camano shoreline in
Port Susan
, just south of the southernmost beach house. -Tyson Parker Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
*

Entry 9:
three different minkes around Eastern Bank
and tons of bird activity. At one point we were watching a bait ball when the water surrounding the boat looked to be speckled with raindrops, strange considering there wasn't a cloud in the sky. It turned out to be hundreds if not thousands of baitfish feeding at the surface! It was incredible to see first-hand the fish that had attracted all of this activity to the bank, as most days we see the predators but not the prey. Just as we were leaving the minkes, the crew spotted a prominent spout close by. It turned out to be a gray whale! -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

UNIDENTIFIED BALEEN WHALE - Tue,

Entry 10:
~

12:00 -
We observed
a lone whale
(not an orca) east of the Swartz Bay ferry terminal near
Sidney BC
on 20 April at approx. 12pm. We could not verify if it was
a humpback or gray
and we lost track of it as we passed around the other side of an island. It was last seen eastbound. (Didn't even see the dorsal (therefore not an orca) only about 3 good blows.) -Mari Wood
