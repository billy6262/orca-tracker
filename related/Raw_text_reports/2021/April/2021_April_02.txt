23:15-

00:15 -
I arrived back in Oak Harbor around
11:15 last night, and while I was unloading the car I heard the familiar
sounds of grays
feeding right off the beach! We ran down toward the beach and listened in the dark for as long as we could bear the cold. There were at least two grays based on where the puffs were coming from, and some spouts and splashes we could just barely see in the light from the stars. I wish I could bottle that feeling somehow - so special! It's like a big hug from Mother Nature! They were at the Happy Meal Mudflats, but very close to shore and moving slowly north, but they stayed in front of our place here for at least an hour. I finally went to bed, but could still hear them right outside at
12:15am. It's low tide now (
2:45pm) and I can see all the scoops they made on the beach (photo attached) - this is prob all from last night unless they snuck in for a snack the previous night or two, because I've been paying attention and the beach has been smooth up until now. There are scoops all up and down the beach here in front of
Mariners Cove
. Woohoo! -Marianne Parry
