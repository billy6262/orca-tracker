Oh it's another happy whale day. About the same time as yesterday and the same spot in the Saratoga passage across
from Bells Beach very close to Camano Island
under a large cliff band just sitting below the backdrop of Mount Baker. If I was closer I'd send pictures. Could be the same two whales as yesterday or maybe they told their friends about this fabulous spot - looks like they have been actively feeding. Feeling very blessed to witness them three days in a row. -Kristin Carlson
