Center for Whale Research Encounter #21: "… Mark confirmed seven individuals in the group; The
T124A's with the T124D's, less T124D2
. The group continued northward against the ebb current after milling around and prey sharing for ~25 minutes before they started to travel northward against the ebb current as they slowly passed through the reefs between the Kelp Reef marker and Little Darcy Island. Several of them appeared to have a chunk of their prize in their mouth as they slowly made their way.
T124A3A
lagged well behind the group, but
T124A
leading the way, would circle back to slow up the procession to allow him to keep up. …." [See CWR Encounter #21 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-21

Hi!!! We saw four orcas this afternoon (

Entry 4:
Diamond Point Beach
when they came out of Discovery Bay! This is the first time we've ever seen orcas and it was spiritual and thrilling! One looked small like it could've been a calf or juvenile but we don't know. And now we're trying to identify whether they were Southern Residents or transients. There were many people who rushed over to look - at least twenty - and some with excellent cameras. Thanks for all you do for orcas!! -Kindly, Freya Wilding

Port Williams in Sequim, WA
