4 orcas with one male passing the Clinton ferry dock heading south

close to these coordinates: (47.7248576, -122.4750870). Not even 5 minutes ago, observed from

GRAY WHALES - Tue, Apr 13 - S. of San Juan Island - It sounds like throughout today, most recently at 4
PM, the gray whale [CRC1364]
has continued to be seen near the
Salmon Bank
marker, visible from the south end of San Juan. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*

Entry 3:
Central Puget Sound/Port Orchard (Strait) -

14:13 -
About 30 minutes ago I saw what I believe to be
a Gray Whale
right in front of our house just a little
south of Brownsville Marina
. It came to the surface a few times and I had a clear look at it. It has the right coloration and the back looked right. It did seem on the smaller side though. Just wondering, have there been any other sightings around this area recently? I'm just trying to figure out if it is likely it was a grey whale, and if not what else it could have been. It was heading north towards Brownsville Marina and Poulsbo. (The only one that has the right color and the little ridges at the tale like what I saw is a gray whale but looking at the size range it seems it would have been on the small side.) -Megan Hudson
*

12:09 -
Spouts from what appears to be a
Grey whale off of Illahee State Park
. They were heading north. -Amanda Bale
*

Entry 4:
April 11] and today [
April 12] our crew and passengers were treated to two unusual sightings for us here in the San Juan Islands! First, we visited with a gray whale, known to researchers as
CRC-1364, feeding near Cattle Pass.
Then on our way home we stopped to check out another cool critter some of our friends had found--a sea otter! While we commonly see river otters on our tours we rarely see their larger cousins, but the past two days brought great looks at them! -Maya's Legacy Whale Watching
*

17:38 - The gray whale
that was hanging around
Salmon Bank and Cattle Point
yesterday is still visible from Cattle Point right now. About 1.5 miles offshore, just to the east of Salmon Bank. Not the best views, but if you want to see a whale's breath from long distance, here you go. -Daven Hafey
[
"This is
gray whale #1364
." -Erin Johns Gless,
]
[
Erin photographed this gray whale in southern Rosario Strait on
March 26, 2021. From her Island Adventures trip report: "We submitted the photos to Cascadia and they were able to identify the whale as
CRC-1364
, a whale seen only once before on
April 9, 2011 off La Push, WA."

Entry 5:
Haro Strait -

16:07 -
Ha! It just tricked me. It is just
north of Lime Kiln
~3/4 mile offshore, I'd guess.

15:51 -
Surfaced in line with sailboat 1/4 mile to the north.

15:47 -
...seems to be surfacing about every 5 mins. Still just a little
south of Lime Kiln
.

15:42 -
Resight. It is now east of midchannel, maybe ~1 mile
west of Lime Kiln
.

15:30 -
Resighted and can confirm
northbound
.

15:23 -
Low bushy blow observed mid Haro off
Land Bank
(~2 miles west). Unfortunately, I don't have binoculars and did not see the body. I would guess
a Gray Whale
based on blow profile. Probably headed north, but I only observed two surfacings. -Michelle Savoie
*

Entry 6:
Saratoga Passage -

11:00 -
I was sitting in the chair by the window… (on a SWS Zoom meeting), scanning out over Saratoga Passage toward Langley. Single Gray Whale, Whidbey side of Saratoga, blows and deep dives. Several tail flukes, but way too far away for photos. Whale gradually worked its way over directly in front of my house just
south of Mabana
. The whale was in quite close, but the tide was too far out for it to reach the ghost shrimp area. Whale then turned and worked its way north toward Mabana. -Barbara Brock
*

09:18 -
There is now a
third gray in Saratoga Passage
near the Whidbey side heading west toward the Langley Marina.

09:05 - 2 grays heading southeast in Saratoga Passage.
Mid-channel but loser to the Camano side near Pebble Beach. -Luanne Seymour

13:01 - 2 Greys
between Howarth and Harborview Park in
Everett

*

12:57 -
Just spent about 10 minutes at a parking lot above the Clinton ferry terminal watching at least
two gray whales
feeding. About 80-100 yards from shore? -Anastasia Nocolov

2-3 Grays off Tyee
Heading south,
2-3 Grays off McKees Beach
heading north, 1-2 Grays off Country Club and 2-3 Grays off Warm Beach heading south. So unless we are reporting very poorly on locations we have between 7 and 11 Grays in Port Susan to start the week! -John C. Storbeck
*

Entry 9:
North Puget Sound/South Whidbey -

18:45-

19:30 -
There was a
HUGE spout
that seemed to be crossing from the
Hansville area to the southern tip of Whidbey
, and followed around to the East side of Whidbey, up to Clinton, and then crossed over toward Hat. We lost track and never were able to ID the species (viewing from Picnic Point) but it was moving FAST. Tracked roughly from 645-730pm. -Lauren McManus
