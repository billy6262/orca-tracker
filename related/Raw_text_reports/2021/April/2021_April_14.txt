Orca Sightings for April 14, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (T49As and T49Bs)
- … After a great safari along Spieden Island, we headed up through Johns Pass toward
Patos Island
to check on some reports from earlier in the day. We got some great views of the Patos Island Lighthouse with Mount Baker standing beautifully in the background. We continued from there and began to make our way south when we stumbled upon a big pod of Bigg's orca whales. It was the whales reported from earlier, and our plan had worked out perfectly! The whales turned out to be the
T49A's and the T49B's
, two sisters and their families. We got to hang with them for some time and even got some close passes before we branched off and checked out Matia Island. Upon rounding the small island, we rejoined the orcas and got a few more great looks before we departed the scene and headed home. …Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
