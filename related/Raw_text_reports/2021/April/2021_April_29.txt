Lagoon Point
close to shore, grouped. Beautiful looks. (At 1750, I thought I saw a male midchannel between me and Ft. Casey. Then I noticed porpoises racing east. Apparently, the orcas headed east then followed the shore south. Anxious porpoise still ahead of the group when I left at 1820, all southbound.) -Rachel Haight

GRAY WHALES - Thu, Apr 29 - Northern Saratoga Passage - I'm passing along a few photos of the beach looking south toward the Happy Meal Mudflats [north Whidbey, near
Mariner's Cove
] that I took two days ago (4/29) when we had the particularly low tide. It's a little hard to see in photos, but from my vantage point, it appears that there is a band of quite
fresh pits
furthest out toward the water, and then the older faded ones closer to the beach. The pits seem to fill in pretty quickly if there's no activity, so perhaps the newer ones are from some stealth midnight snacking. Just passing it along in case it's useful to know that maybe they're sneaking up here when nobody's looking. -Marianne Parry

Hello!
Two grey whales, NB,
Saratoga Pass. Mid channel. About 1.5 miles from
Langley
. It's the two, who, the research team was tracking. Spray, flukes. Their activity is busy, frisky. Research vessel stayed way back, and the whales came over to check them out. -Kathleen Barker

Entry 4:
10.25 - Two gray whales southbound, Port Susan
, just south of Kayak Point.
----With not a ripple to be seen and calm conditions offering a slightly surreal effect, we watched in wonder as five gray whales socialized and performed an exquisite ballet of fins and flukes feeding in the
shallow waters of Port Susan
. The milky light offered an opportunity to enjoy the beauty of backlit blows, accompanied by the powerful sound of 'bellowing' exhalations carrying across the quiet sea. The cry of a loon and occasional flapping of scoters in flight, quick to take advantage of any scraps from the smorgasbord stirred up by the whales' party, were the only other interruptions to the almost eerie silence. This was a unique encounter with a mesmerizing spy-hop by one whale rising slowly...oh-so-slowly...to take a cautious look around before sinking...oh-so-slowly...down into the murky depths (too hypnotized to get a picture -Sandra Pollard
