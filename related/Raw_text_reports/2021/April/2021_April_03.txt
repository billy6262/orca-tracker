Orca Sightings for April 3, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (J pod) -

13:03-

16:25
- Center for Whale Research Encounter #16: "… The large tactile group broke up some and we followed a small group that consisted of the
J37s, J40, and J46
as they began moving quickly northwest about a quarter mile off the Stuart Island shoreline. As this group moved closer to Turn Point, the J31s rejoined them and now the J35s were paralleling the group while closer to the Stuart Island shoreline.
Nearing Turn Point
, the
J35s
joined the offshore group and all these whales turned west and toward us. We shut off the engine and then the whales began milling all around/under/beside the boat for a couple minutes while we sat there.
J57
rolled around on his mom's back right off our stern before J35 did a slow turn and a slower glide right along side us with J57 in tow. J35 had had a similar relaxed attitude around the research boat when
J47
was young and she had also brought him over to introduce him years ago.
J38
appeared again and he and J47 were socializing together off Turn Point. The whales began moving off to the west-northwest in the direction of Moresby Island. …" [See CWR Encounter #16 for full summary and more photos. https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-16 ]

----SO grateful to my friends who spotted them outside of Friday Harbor. I was able to run down the trail and make it to Point Caution just in time to see them close to shore in a beautiful resting line. Added bonus - a few curious Steller sea lions who were also whale watching. Then on to Reuben Tarte for another close pass, right after they woke up from their nap. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

11:30 - Large group of Southern Residents northbound right outside of Friday Harbor
. ----We already had plans to head out on the water and were incredibly lucky to stumble upon J-Pod right outside of Friday Harbor as we left the dock. They were all together in a resting line, an uncommon sight. It's hard to capture in a photo but I tried with this shot! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

11:09 -
Hi guys! Just saw several orcas from the ferry just off
James/Decatur Island
. Any ideas which ones they would be? They were heading west, same as ferry, and then changed direction and went behind the ferry. So I guess that would have been north? -Lucy DeGrace, Skagit Fisheries Enhancement Group.
[
I believe it turned out to be the
T99s and T124A2s
group of Bigg's Transients. -alb

Entry 3:
San Juans (T46Bs, T86As, T123s) -
I've been so blessed to witness so many Bigg's orcas as their population grows and grows. Two-and-a-half-year-old
Tl'uk
was pretty spunky as he played with his sister,
T123 cousins and T086A
youngsters. Great to see him so energetic! -April Ryan, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching
*

18:00 - [orcas]
I lost them just before they went behind
Iceberg Pt.
about 6 PM. (heading ENE). -Fred Horn

Good sized group of Bigg's killer whales about
2 miles south of Cattle Point

T123s, the T086As, and the T046B1s
) -Daven Hafey

Entry 4:
Central Puget Sound (T65As and T137s) -

Just
south of the Narrows Bridge
. Shot from Narrows Park in Gig Harbor. -Aaron Berg
*

18:48-

19:10 - A pod of orcas came past 1 Point Fosdick
heading first out into the mid channel in Hale Passage and then towards the Fox Island Bridge- first spotted at 1848 and observed until about 1910 when they moved out of sight to the west towards the bridge. The bull was first seen very close to the beach-the whole group worked out into the mid channel and went back and forth for a while. A slick area suggested that they had made a kill, but no bird activity feeding in the area so maybe just hunting. This is almost exactly 1 year from when orcas came by here before (
April 8, 2020). I think there were
about 8 individuals
- but they stayed spread out except for the one group of a female and juveniles? that stayed closer together. I assume these are Bigg's, but don't know which group. Thanks for what you do, -David Estroff

---- …more from today when the first group rounded
Pt. Defiance
from Dalco to the Narrows. It was sometime between

17:35-
17:45. It looked like these 3 were going to join the main group by Colvos, but they snuck by me and rounded the point. When I spotted them, one did a spy hop. These three also would swim one direction, then turn around and swim the opposite direction for one or two breaths, but then filp again and carry on. I thought they were going to start milling several times, but they did not. -Ashley Whitman

----Hope you all had a wonderful Easter weekend! Was glad to see the sun and get in a little visit with the
T137's and T65A's
. Didn't get too many good pics as they were very spread out and far from shore except Jack, who surprised us all by popping up 10 minutes after the others passed. Found myself way down shore watching the others disappear and turn my head and suddenly there's Jack, riding the shelf drop off, lol, then pulled a disappearing trick. Managed to grab a perspective pic but nothing more, sneaky, sneaky, love that dude! -Marla Smith
*
Yesterday I had the beach all to myself when
T137A-Jack and his two siblings, T137B-Tempest, T137D-Wright
surfaced right in front of me as if I could reach out and touch them! They were 15 feet from the beach in hot pursuit of a seal. Oh how quick, stealthy, and effortlessly they cut through the water to sneak up on the seal! At first they were barely surfacing, only to breathe. It was an amazing scene to watch as they snuck up on the seal swimming casually in front of them. Eventually the seal caught on and scrambled quickly to get away from the group of siblings into the shallows. Unfortunately, I had my long lens on my camera and could not get a shot of the three of them surfacing at the same time as seal. They were just too close for my lens. -Kelly Burns Keenan

COASTAL ORCAS - Saturday at about

at the very northern end of Sonoma County, while watching for migrating grays and seabirds,

about 9AM. Haven't been spotted since. -John C. Storbeck
*

Entry 8:
gray whale CRC531
stole the show anyway with a big spyhop near
Hat Island
! It happened in a spot where we have seen gray whales spyhop more frequently than in any other place. It's a bit of a mystery why that seems to be "The Spyhop Spot" but some of us speculate that there might be some structure on the bottom that they are rubbing up against and the spyhop results from that. A gray whale often sends up a big bubble blast from under water before it spyhops. It certainly helps you get your camera ready for something good. We also spotted a brand new gray whale for 2021 feeding at the edge of the delta. I sent photos of the whale to Cascadia Research Collective and they did not find the whale in their ID catalog so it will likely be getting a brand-new ID number. -Photographer/Naturalist Bart Rulon
