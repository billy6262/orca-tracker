That boat has since moved on but now seeing a few orcas likely on a hunt. Some tail lobs, breaches, milling in same spot. I am viewing far away. Trending north and just out in front of
Eglon
. Perspective is hard from where I'm viewing way up high on Whidbey.

13:45 -
There is a small white boat parked with the orcas. Saw a large male surface nearby. Guessing just north of
Eglon
, definitely Kitsap side. -Rachel Haight

Spotted
3-4 dorsals headed north from Emma Schmitz

Center for Whale Research Encounter #7: "… Within seven minutes of departure they started the encounter within a quarter mile north of Ten Mile Point light. Upon arrival they could see that they just missed a kill as the two individuals were milling about in a large sweet-smelling slick amongst scavenging gulls (48 27.4/123 15.7). As Mike 1 eased into the area to confirm their identity, Joe was slightly quicker than Mark to confirm that it was
the two brothers T060D and T060E
. He second guessed himself for a moment as he saw in the back of his camera his distant photo showed a second notch in who he thought was T060E's fin. It did turn out to be him, now with a new notch half way down the trailing edge just below his known notch. …" [See CWR Encounter #7 for full summary and photos - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-7]

. This morning and just saw a blow. Assuming it’s the same Gray that’s been seen here last few days. Waiting to spot again. (update 1: confirmed Gray about halfway out from hidden beach moving towards Baby Island. update 2: closer to Camano now milling about a bit. Several blows.) -Kevin Doar
