Orca Sightings for January 20, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents
even came to celebrate with us! I know we still have so much work to do to save them and it won't be easy. But today, it just feels a little more achievable. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

3:34. -Meg Sellers

15:10-

16:00 - 7-9 members of J-Pod, including 3 large males, southbound 1/4 mile south of Edwards Pt/ Landbank
. They were spread out with one group of 3 traveling tight for a short time. They were 1/2 mile out from my position on shore. J22 Oreo, J26 Mike, J45 Se-Yi-Chn and possibly J46 Star. They surfaced infrequently and didn't rise high out of the water. Still... J-Pod! Photos very cropped and enlarged. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 3:
Discovery Bay -

10:31 - [humpback]
It was in yesterday also in the same area. I first saw it just off
Gardiner heading towards Contractors Point
moving slowly. Watched it (think there was just one) for about 2 hours. Hung out by Contractors Point for quite a while then on way out I saw it blow again around Gardiner's bluff and never saw it again. Today it seems to be going back and forth between those two places. Moving very slowly, blows and then dives - about 8-10 minutes later the same. Way too far for me to get a photo as I am at Beckett Point. -Karel Reeves
