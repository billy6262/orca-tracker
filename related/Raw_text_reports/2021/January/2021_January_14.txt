Entry 1:
Central Puget Sound (T124As)
- It was recently confirmed from...distant eyepatch photos taken by Kelly Keenan and Brittany Philbin [see reports and photos below]...that young
T124A3A
is alive and traveling with his grandmother's (
T124A
) and great aunt's (
T124D
) families after losing his Mum in November. For more information on how individuals in this population have been tracked up and down the west coast of North America by scores of data contributors using photo-identification for several decades, please see our 2019 photo-identification catalogue developed in partnership with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Center for Whale Research, North Gulf Oceanic Society, and Strawberry Isle Marine Research Society.

Caught them at

T124A's travel by Lincoln Park. T124A3a (born in 2019) lost his Mom, Wasini (T124A3), in November.
This bit of news makes their visit even more special knowing that T124A3a is surviving with his extended family. -Kelly Burns Keenan
