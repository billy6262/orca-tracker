============================================================

Entry 1:
~

14:20 -
I left from high bank
Baby Island Heights
as he was slowly traveling SB, and I headed to high bank mid Baby Island Heights but have not seen him since. He's on looong downtimes.

14:09 -
He's kind of milling out here at
Baby Island
, slowly heading south.

14:01 -
Watched the gray at
Baby Island
heading into Holmes Harbor about Â¼ mile, it's now heading out. I will watch to see which way it's going.

13:47 - Gray at Baby Island
heading south into Holmes Harbor.
-----Watched
Little Patch round Baby Island into Holmes Harbor
and back out. He didn't stay long in the harbor. Watched him again southeast side of Baby Island heading east, and then looking like he was making another turn? I headed to mid Baby Island Heights to view as I can see much better over towards Hidden Beach, Camano State Park and Elger Bay. but I lost him. He could have easily turned back northwest and possibly towards Harbor again??? -Marilyn Armbruster
