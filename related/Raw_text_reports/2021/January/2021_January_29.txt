Center for Whale Research Encounter #6: "… With some direction from shore-spotter extraordinaire, Gord Rowles, they were able to catch up with the group of Bigg's as they traversed the Oak Bay Flats. The encounter began at 1214 (48 24.4/123 16.2) as the whales were travelling quickly east for Sea Bird Point, and dove in a tight group as the boat slowed on approach. When they surfaced, the two bulls instantly gave away the T085 matriline, and the matriarch surfaced shortly just ahead of them alongside her youngest,
T085D
. Mark and Joe encountered these whales as they entered the Salish Sea on
January 19th of this year, see Encounter #04 for more details. …" [See CWR Encounter #6 for full summary and photos - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-6]

He's still at
Hidden Beach
feeding. Got at least another hr+ of daylight for folks in the area. He's still feeding mid cove, north of parking lot and a little 10 min walk. Not a lot of beach to walk on but you can see him from end of dirt road too...it's public.

Still feeding here at cove. Hard for me to leave. He feeds, goes out takes a breather and comes back in for more

Martin Sibonga called to report seeing
a gray whale feeding in Saratoga Passage
, Whidbey side north of Hidden Beach (across from Cama Beach).

12:58 -
The whale went north about a mile or so. I'm not 100% sure there were two whales. When I first saw them I thought I saw two whales sticking out of the water, but later on I only saw one when I went north; that whale is headed back south towards Hidden Beach

11:10 -
Just saw some whales by
hidden beach
on Whidbey Island didn't get a great look but it appeared to be two whales but not orcas. -Aaron Gill
