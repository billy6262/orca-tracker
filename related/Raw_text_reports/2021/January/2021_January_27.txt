Orca Sightings for January 27, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Little Patch
has been around especially early this year. I'm assuming that is who our visitor was yesterday. End of
Mabana Road
for at least an hour. Tide in and an usually large assortment of feathered followers: the usual Scoter, but also Merganser, Bufflehead, and Gull. First photo from our bluff, then I drove down to Mabana Road access. No tail shows until I had put the camera away! -Barbara Brock
