Center for Whale Research Encounter #2: "… The encounter began a few hundred meters west of the "VH" buoy at 1130 (48 22.2/123 24.4). Two of the first whales encountered were
J38 and K44
, travelling side-by-side and confirming suspicions that the animals were Southern Residents. At the same time, there was an outbound container ship in the pilot station that apparently annoyed Mark and Joe more than it did the whales, as they cruised calmly alongside for a few minutes before it outpaced them and headed for sea. J40 was identified in a small group of females and juveniles which also included
J41, J51 and J58. J37 and her youngster J49
were just apart from them with
J31, J46 and J44
. …" [See CWR Encounter #2 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-2?cid=e39437d2-50ae-4e20-b54e-ac84878360f7 for full summary and photos]
