16:50 -
Pretty sure I just saw a
humpback deep in Commencement Bay
. It took a deep dive at about
4:50. I never saw it again. I initially saw it as I was driving, it was huge so figured humpback with the way it dove, no fluke. But a fisherman saw it as well. Off Theas Park heading into Thea Foss Waterway. -Amber Stanfill
[
A gray whale was confirmed in Commencement Bay on the 24th, so this could potentially be the same whale. -gs
