Tom Knowak called (on Monday Nov 1) to report seeing orcas, including cow/calf pair in
Port Gardner Bay
in the Mission Beach area at around
5:10pm, yesterday. They were ~1km from shore and appeared to round up sea lions, hunted for about 20 minutes, then continued on towards Port Susan Bay. Believes they were Bigg's transients based on behavior.

At 1pm on 10/31/2021, I found myself being followed by
four orcas
. They started following me when I turned the corner at Possession Point heading north. It appeared to be 2 young adults and 2 very young calves. I never stopped and continued at 8 knots towards Everett Marina. They followed and acted in a playful manner. At one point the two young calves came up to the swim step of the boat as the two older whales breached and tail slapped. All four appeared to be healthy and happy. -Burke Barnes

Entry 6:
Possession Sound -

02:30 -
Last night at
2:30 am, we had an encounter with 1 (maybe one of these 3 [UnID'd orcas]) just south of the ferry dock. It was maybe 20 feet away from the beach and blowing water and slapping its fins. Truly magical (too dark to identify). We were at the south end of the (
Mukilteo
) lighthouse park sitting on the beach (waiting for the aurora that did not come). They/it were/was headed south but very close to shore (and the tide had come up a few feet). -Ashley Johnson
