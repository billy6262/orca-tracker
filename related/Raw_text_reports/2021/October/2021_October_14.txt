Leaders have passed green marker buoy

----
October 14 heralded the good news that
Southern Residents had stayed overnight, and were still in the Possession Triangle
. Begging the question 'how much longer will they stay?' was soon answered as the orcas, well-spread out between Whidbey and the Kitsap side, slowly made their way north in Admiralty Inlet foraging along the way, accompanied by plenty of surface behaviors - breaches, tail-slaps, spy-hops. Although they were closer to Marrowstone Island when
passing Bush Point
and binoculars and a long lens were beneficial, whale-watchers were still able to enjoy and appreciate the spectacular sight of this unique population on one of the rare occasions they graced us with their presence (photos Richard Snowberger, zoomed and cropped) -Sandra Pollard
*

16:05 -
Looks like most have passed us, now closer to Whidbey, about 1 mile
south of Bush Pt
. headed toward Bush Pt.

14:40 -
We see the orcas spread out
across Admiralty Inlet
, one large male headed NW
past Point No Point Lighthouse
, past Hansville by now. Others are mid-channel, some close to the Whidbey side off Useless Bay but headed our way (we are N end of Mutiny Bay). Looking committed to heading out Admiralty, but lots of foraging, breaching, and activity. Very spread out. -Susan Berta & Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

17:43 -
They have grouped up pretty tightly now, slowly
moving north
closer to mid-channel.

17:19 -
Straight out from the lighthouse, hugging the Whidbey side. There have been no orcas on this side.

16:48 -
Moving quickly, well
north of bush Point
, closer to the Whidbey side.

16:40 -
They have moved way east, traveling; northeast line of sight from here, it's almost
Bush Point
.

16:34 -
They totally ignored that ship. lots of splashing tail slapping breaching.

16:28 -
Some have moved east from the yellow channel marker, appear to be heading for that container ship.

16:22 -
From the hill at
fort Flagler
they are nearing the yellow channel buoy. Look like heading this way, can't tell much else from here.

14:44 -
Okay, just spotted them well north, out from
Mutiny Bay
, look like east of mid channel heading north.
2:44.
(
14:28)

Point No Point
, they were spread out
between Useless Bay and Scatchet Head
. I have not seen them at all for the last 10 minutes. -Jim Pasola

13:45-

14:02 -
Yesterday afternoon from
1:45 to
2:02 I photographed
five Orcas from Point No Point
as they swam close to Whidbey Island. There were a few people there with much better lenses than mine, but I'm sending you my photos in case they are helpful in any way. We also saw several large salmon leaping out of the water close to Point No Point. Thank you for your important work! -Wendy Feltham, Port Townsend
*

16:30 -
Container ship passed them with orcas on west side of ship. Viewing from
Scurlock Rd
. So they pretty much have been mid or just Jefferson side of mid. NB loosely grouped.

15:22 -
Watching orcas viewing from
Shore Meadows
(Whidbey) 10-12 orca. Mid channel and line of sight with Foulweather Bluff. NB but have picked up pace.

14:42 -
Viewing from
Double Bluff
parking lot. See map [north of Hansville, mid-channel]. Fins are pointing north. But not moving quickly.

13:45 -
Still viewing from
Maxwelton
and line of sight with Hansville, spread out a little, NB still

13:30 -
Viewing from Maxwelton, see map drop point [a little south of
Point No Point
, and a little closer to west side]. NB still. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

13:52 -
Still spread out but all seem to be between
Point No Point
and Whidbey. Closer to Whidbey side. So much surface action still - spyhops, cartwheels, breaches, etc.

13:14 -
Most are north of the beach point now.

13:08 -
They are continuing north
between Whidbey & Point No Point
. Still very spread out. Mid & west of channel s.

12:57 -
Still viewing from
Point No Point
. They are still trending north. West of mid channel now. Still lots of surface activity.

12:25 -
Viewing from
Point No Point
. South from here & still south of Whidbey. Still trending north but very spread out. I would guess that they are mid channel. Lots of surface activity again - so many breaches.

12:10-

12:17 -
I'm kinda far from them still but there are sooo many of them! I have some breaches and spyhops but watching them from
Point No Point
now. South of here still but still heading this direction.

11:45 -
They are continuing north direction and position seems to be on the west side of Whidbey. Still lots of surface activity.

11:30 - [orcas] Viewing from Eglon
. Lots of surface activity. Still trending north. Slightly east of mid channel. -Tisa Annette
*

12:00 -
The
orcas
are still milling and directional changes, lots of surface activity. Haven't had to move my telescope much in the past 45 mins. But definitely trending north.

11:15 -
They've stalled. Lots of directional changes. Surface activity, foraging/milling around.

11:00 - [orcas]
Lots of breaching and surface activity about halfway
between Apple Tree and Eglon
. Heading north on Kitsap side. (Chennault Beach neighborhood in Mukilteo). -Alice Thuy Talbot
*

10:51 -
We are transiting through the south end of Admiralty Inlet (just off
Apple Cove Point
) and spotted a pod of between 8 and 10 orca (at least two adult males) lazily swimming
northbound
. Unclear whether they were heading into Possession Sound OR intending to transit Admiralty Inlet. Also, unable to verify whether SRKW or transients. Thought you might want the sighting to put a pin in the map. We are onboard the sailing vessel Atalaya. -Erin Moore
*

10:35-

10:40 -
I ended up seeing 10-12 individuals spread out from
Apple Tree Point North
, with trailers foraging closer in on Kitsap side and leading males heading north towards Possession Triangle - all west of midchannel - last ones passed out of sight around.

10:20 -
Donna Green Van Renselaar called to report she is watching orcas, at least 3 males and young one, spread out north to south,
north of Edmonds
sightline to Picnic Point (from Apple Tree Point, Kingston). Kitsap side to mid-channel milling while trending northbound.

10:05 -
Single male orca northbound, west of midchannel, viewing from
Apple Tree Pt
. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

Entry 2:
North Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet -

17:20 -
White-colored whale (long body, no dorsal fin seen) surfaced 3 times,
east channel Whidbey side north of Lagoon Point ...
Follow-up: The first thought from my neighbor (standing right next to me, her turn on the binoculars) was beluga ... It was clearly white (easy to see in the coming dusk on the water, unlike a grayer minke) and she didn't see any dorsal. I asked if it could've been a minke? "Too white." Very doubtful it was an [orca] underbelly because it surfaced 3 times, like we've seen whales getting air ...
By the time I had the glasses it was around the curve of the beach. Heading north toward what I grew up calling "the bombing range" (Lake Hancock is the inner section of "the range") not sure if it followed the land or continued more in a straight line north. (No pics, no video)
Update: After review of her [Shelley's neighbor] experience yesterday ... She's
90% sure it was the beluga
. Because she saw it surface three times, each time she could better judge this was not any of the whales or marine mammals that are usually here at Lagoon Point. -Shelley Schwinn
*

Entry 3:
Central Puget Sound -

10:30 -
At
10:45, Orca Network received a call from Tori Volk: her husband Jay Volk is out fishing, about
one mile off Golden Gardens/Shilshole. Beluga
swam by heading northbound at
10:30.
*

09:10 -
We spotted the beluga whale at
9:10 a.m. this morning. It's just about due west of Elliott Bay Marina less than 1 mi per our chart plotter. We are currently at 47.62990/-122.42394 and it was ~100-200 m east of us. We've drifted a little south. It was milling about. We haven't had a resight but we did watch it surface ~6 times before it dove. -Sasha Ertl, Biologist, Grette Associates [marine mammal observer for pile driving project]
*

Entry 4:
12:00 -
Just south of the green buoy and the
south end of Possession Beach
, I saw the unidentified whale again. Does look like a minke only because it's definitely not a grey or humpback. -Alice Thuy Talbot
