Orca Sightings for October 17, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
W. Strait of Juan de Fuca -
After leaving Newport, Oregon on Saturday
October 16 we (staff from the Northwest and Alaska Fisheries Science Centers) sailed north searching for Southern Resident killer whales visually and acoustically off the coasts of Oregon and Washington. On Sunday
October 17, we encountered
Southern Resident killer whales near the west end of the Strait of Juan de Fuca
. Working with our colleagues from MarEcoTel in our respective small work boats, we set about monitoring the whale's occurrence and movements in this area, fall diet, health, and acoustic activity. We have been able to relocate the whales during the three subsequent days in the same general area and collected some prey and fecal samples. In addition, we have also encountered other marine mammal species; numerous humpback whales, and Dall's porpoise trying to bow ride on the killer whales! -Dr. Brad Hanson, NOAA Fisheries West Coast

Entry 2:
NPS/Admiralty Inlet (Ks) - ~

18:30 -
Tuned in at ~
6:30 and heard distant SRKW vocalizations on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
. -Gayle Swigart, Orca Network
*

18:03 -
Still great
calls on Port Townsend hydrophone
! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

17:41 -
Just watched a group of
6-9 orcas heading west
, mid channel,
between Point Wilson and Ebey's Landing
. Looked like there were two males, several females, and at least one little one. Moving fairly quickly. Too far away to see much. -Betsy Carlson, PTMSC
*

17:26 -
A bit past
fort Casey
now. Tail slapping and spyhops.

17:24 - [orcas] Passing fort Casey
now (
17:24), headed
northbound
, mid channel I'd say. -Holly Weinstein
*

17:27 - SRKW calls
masked now due to sudden onset of ship noise from the Washington State Ferries Chelan, but it should decrease once across closer to Whidbey Island.

17:15 - [SRKW] Faint, but abundant calls.
-Scott Veirs, Orcasound/Beam Reach
*

17:00 - Faint K pod kitten calls on PT hydrophone
. -Brittany Noelle
*

15:48 - Still northbound
. Seeing more come through now.

15:11 - [orcas] Up at north Lagoon Point
beach! -Christina Wheat
*

15:05 -
Kit Turner called to report seeing a group of
orcas
across from the south end of
Lagoon Point
, over on Marrowstone side, heading steadily north. She's only seen 2, but is sure there are more, she just couldn't see them clearly because it is fairly gray and yucky out there.
*

15:10 -
Just at south beach
Lagoon Point, northbound
. I think there are at least a dozen or more.

14:43 - [orca]
Still one large one at the south beach. -Cheryl Connor
*

14:39 - [orcas]
I see them now! Just saw a breach. Watching from my house up on
Smugglers Cove Road
. -Patricia Prochaska
*

17:34 -
Viewing from Ebey's Landing, and I barely can make out fins with binoculars. Line of sight
north and west of Point Wilson Lighthouse. NW bound.

17:15 - Orcas between Admiralty Lighthouse and Port Townsend
, northwest bound. Guessing again around middish channel.

14:24 -
Pretty spread out north and south by a few miles. Have seen at least
12+ NB
still.

13:56 -
Rain and poor visibility making it a little tough viewing. They are still
south of Lagoon Pt
. and currently active, seeing a bit of splashing going on out about middish channel. Viewing from Southend Lagoon Point.

13:35 - [orcas] Mid channel, midway between Bush and Lagoon Points. Northbound
. -Marilyn Armbruster
*
A different sighting report from Scott Veirs who was in the sky with Kenmore Air. He himself did not see the orcas (or humpbacks), nor did any other passengers he checked in with, but pilot did on an earlier flight: "...last run north pilot Thomas said he saw orcas 100yds off bow of Naval ship (USS Monsoor) with a bunch of sailors whale watching. He said off
Double Bluff
. Most of the
pod was moving northbound
with the Naval ship, but a smaller group of ~3 whales was trailing a good ways back (many ship lengths?)... To be clear, though, the impression Thomas gave me was that the orcas had approached the Navy ship (which the AIS records show was maintaining speed of ~17 knots). It sounds like the orcas may have been porpoising in the bow wake as they have done with cruising commercial ships, and then the sailors observed them. I did not get the impression that the Navy ship had slowed or changed course to approach the SRKWs.
*

13:10 -
After finding and viewing humpbacks, and while en-route to the San Juan Islands in search of known Bigg's orcas, MV Saratoga spotted
orcas in Admiralty Inlet
. While keeping distance of at least 1/2 mile, Bart Rulon could confirm residents, members of K pod at least, so they continued on.
*

12:50 -
The Scotts at
Bush Point
called to report that they just had
5 orcas go by heading northbound
, mid channel to Whidbey side. 1 male, 3-4 smaller.
*

Entry 3:
Haro Strait (T2Cs) -
Really lovely visit with the T2Cs today and I managed to snag this family portrait. Left to right,
T2C1 "Rocky", T2C5 (b. 2020), T2C3 "Lucy", and T2C "Tasu".
-Sara Hysong-Shimazu
*

11:40 - Orcas headed north, Mitchell Point
. -James Mead Maya
*

11:39 -
We just saw the minke followed by the
Bigg's [T2Cs]
from
San Juan County Park
. -Ursula Valdez
*
On a perfect October Sunday (17th), with light rain ALL day, we headed towards
Haro Strait and found two humpbacks, BCX 0158 Kappa
and another (no fluke ID shots) in beautiful calm waters ï¿½ breathtaking. Then a little further north found the
T002Cs
, leisurely traveling in a southbound direction, with mom Tasu T002C and 3 of her offspring. AND I saw another humpback from the ferry - while trying to track K-pod as they left Puget Sound (no luck there). photo - "
Rocky T00C1
", photo - "Mom Tasu with
newest calf T002C5
" -Jill Hein
*

11:00 - Reports of Bigg's killer whales pursuing a minke north up Haro Strait
.
----It's been two and a half years since we've had an encounter with the
T2Cs
, and their family group has been through quite a few changes since then. T2C2 Tumbo, the teenage male with scoliosis, has passed away, and T2C4 Kano also appears to be missing. But there's a new addition in T2C5, as yet unnamed, who was born at the end of 2020, and meeting this less than year-old calf was definitely the highlight of our visit with them in Haro Strait this afternoon. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 4:
Haro Strait -

16:57-

17:10 -
A single humpback northbound approaching
Edwards Point
just south of Landbank Westside Preserve. As I watched the humpback, I could hear blows to the south. Within a few minutes 2 more humpbacks came into view traveling northbound closer to shore 1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 5:
NPS/Admiralty Inlet -

17:00 -
(
5:00 pm) I'm looking at one humpback in between
Fort Flagler
and Keystone heading north. It just did a deep dive. I'm also seeing two killer whales [SRKWs], one male and one female in the same area heading the same way. The orcas are spread out and I am way too far away to Id them. (viewing from
Fort Flagler
) -Emily Calkins
*

16:08 -
Jack Birchard called while standing in the middle of the park at
Camp Casey
. While looking out from the edge of bluff trying to spot the orcas, he is seeing two large whales who are much bigger than orcas, they are hanging out about 200 yards offshore. Jack describes them as having big wings or arms, grayish/brownish in color. Much larger that orcas, I think seeing two, possibly third but that might be fin of the other two. They were heading south, now heading north. Little bit windy, little bit wet. But he'll continue to hang out. "I don't know what I am seeing, but it's pretty great". They were coming out of the water more than 10 feet, then flopping down. [pretty much describes
humpbacks
- alb]

both humpbacks
together. Pretty much halfway to Eglon. 2 beautiful whales. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

12:06 - [HBs]
Seem to be south of Whidbey and trending east a little, line of sight is with
Double Bluff
now. Haha, now I know why I didn't see dorsals LOL. -Michelle Goll

The second
humpback
appears to be a juvenile. Two Spot tends to like hanging out with the juvies it seems.

They are slowly northwest-bound.
