We left them as they passed
Scatchet Head
center triangle, westbound, then before green buoy marker they
turned southerly
or towards Kitsap. This was around
17:30 (
5:30pm). So here's hoping they are filling their bellies

The rest are still milling
south of Possession Point

southeast of Possession Point
heading northeast towards me in Mukilteo. They've rounded up into Possession Sound heading north. -Alice Thuy Talbot
