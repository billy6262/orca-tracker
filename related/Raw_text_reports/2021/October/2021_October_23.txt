Entry 2:
13:18 - Grey whale(??)
just off the shore at Grapeview (
Pickering Passage) heading south
. Too far away to tell for sure but not an orca. Dark color, big, no visible dorsal fin. We saw white on the underside of the flukes, but we didn't see 'em that clearly. It was a couple miles away. Mostly saw spout and dark colored back. -Gary Frankel

Saw this humpback down in
Totten Inlet
this morning. - Follow-up: Unfortunately, I didn't get any [images] as I was out fishing. it was going north past Windy Point on the west side of the inlet. I was shocked, as I've never seen them down this far south! -Kody Elzinga
