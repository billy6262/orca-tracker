Orca Sightings for October 16, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
NPS/Admiralty Inlet (Ks) -
At least one orca was seen (w/video) just
north of the Edmonds/Kingston ferry
traffic lanes by Adam Graves who was on the
2:30 from Edmonds to Kingston run. Looked like a male heading southbound. (PSWS)
*

12:53 -
Confirmed
K-pod
at least. We left after a few minutes, but afterward I was able to confirm it was
K33, Tika
, that was chasing a salmon.

12:15 -
We spotted what is likely resident orcas
off Mutiny Bay
. I could not ID any of the whales for sure from over a half mile away and with lots of waves but judging by behaviors (one was likely chasing a fish in tight circles at the surface) they are likely Southern Residents so we are leaving to look for whales elsewhere. Didn't stay long enough to determine the direction. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

11:45 - [orca]
I just spotted one individual off the point at
Double Bluff
, near the coast guard light (not down by the park). Breached 3x. Possibly heading south. Time

, more J pod like.

9:54) at Port Townsend hydrophone
. The calls were faint, possibly the S01 type..."
*

09:00 -
I'm listening to a group of Orcas live on the Port Townsend hydrophone. Follow-up: It sounded like residents. They were very close to the hydrophone around 9-
9:15am and then moved further away. Happy to see that someone spotted them! -Megan Bungum

Entry 2:
Haro Strait (T123s) -

10:35 -
Losing sight of them as they head offshore (NW) into the white caps.

10:15 - T123A off County Park
now milling, no sign of the others yet. Thanks Sara Hysong-Shimazu for ID confirmation! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
*

09:38-

09:42 - 3 orcas northbound
5-600 yds from shore, 1 mile south of
Landbank Westside Preserve
. A female and calf followed pretty far behind by a large male, T123A. The sea was choppy with some white caps and I only caught sight of the female and calf twice. [
"It's looking like the whales you spotted might be the only report of Ts in the Salish Sea today! This is significant because
we're on an incredible >200 consecutive day run of having at least some Bigg's killer whales present somewhere in inland waters
. I expect the streak to end sometime soon, but thanks to your report, it lives on through today!" -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI
