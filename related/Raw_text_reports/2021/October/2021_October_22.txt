Orca Sightings for October 22, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
W. Strait of Juan de Fuca (Js)
- Despite the large swell, the team from Northwest Fisheries Science Center, onboard the Bell M. Shimada, was able to locate members of J pod on Friday morning as they headed west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca and towards Swiftsure Bank. We joined the NOAA team on the water, and with help from observers on the big ship to keep track of the spread out group in large swells, we were able to stay with the animals most of the day. We collected 2 prey samples and one fecal on our boat, and the NOAA boat collected a number of samples as well. -Marine Ecology and Telemetry Research

Entry 2:
E. Strait of Juan de Fuca (T99s) -
Check out the
newest member of the T99 pod - T99E!
The new calf has officially been given its alphanumeric ID (T99E) now that Bella (T99) has been determined to be the mom (special thanks to Gary Sutton for confirmation on that). This brings Bella's family up to 5 orcas now. We've had a few encounters with the T99s this year, but we had some of our best views of this little cutie on both our trips from Edmonds and Port Townsend with Puget Sound Express on Oct 22. It all happened after the family caught a harbor seal just
north of Minor Island
, which is a favorite harbor seal haul-out spot. The family swam along together as they were eating their meal, and spunky little T99E was popping up all over the place, next to mom, next to siblings and also all by him/herself! The calves don't hold their breath as long as the adults on some of the long dives so you often see a calf pop up by itself for a quick breath while the rest of the family stays down longer. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

13:20 -
Just spent about 45 minutes with
T99s off NAS Whidbey
... hunting.. adorable baby! They were heading east as we left them.----Out on IE on a gray, damp but smooth day, and we caught up the T99 group of Bigg's out from NAS Whidbey air base. This family is
T99 Bella (born 1984), the matriarch, T99B Holly (b. female, 2007), T99C Bearcat (b.2009 unknown gender), T99D (b. 2015 unknown gender), and T99E (b. about
August 2021, also unknown gender.
They began a harbor seal hunt pretty quickly, and dispatched that poor little one. They were heading northwest, out to Smith Island, where they began a hunt on a Stellar sea lion! Lots of huge tail slaps and lunges, big water everywhere. It took them about half an hour. Exciting day for my last boat trip of the season!! -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 6:
South Puget Sound

16:55 - Thinking it was a humpback
. It was really moving with a huge spout.

16:19 -
Too big [for a minke]. We saw it surfacing four times and never saw a dorsal fin so thinking it is a grey.

16:10 -
No obvious dorsal fin and very dark. Went north through
Drayton Passage
.

16:00 -
We are seeing a very large whale in front of our house on Johnson Point headed towards Drayton Passage. It came from the Tolmie Park area. Are we looking at a humpback or a gray? Our neighbor texted saying her friend saw a whale blow in front of their house at Beach Crest then it popped up in front of our house (north of Tolmie). -Lorrie Dozier Hall
