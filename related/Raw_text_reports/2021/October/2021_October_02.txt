Sun, Sept 26; Tue, Sept 28; & Sat, Oct 2 - Admiralty Inlet Tara Klein follow-up: Oct 2: I am less certain about the first sighting, but on the 28th and today [Oct 2], I saw what
appeared to be the dorsal or tail fins
, and the curved, black, backs of what I believed to be orcas. I suppose they could have been dolphins, but they appeared to be very dark black, and I'm not sure I would have been able to spot creatures as small as dolphins from this distance. I can't possibly be sure that what I saw were orcas; even with a high-power spotting scope, the distance is such that I was unable to see much detail. However, they were very black, and the length of the backs as they broke the surface seemed inconsistent with smaller marine mammals. I just want to know what I spotted (and I now believe they MUST have been smaller cetaceans. What I DON'T want is to misreport, as this does nobody any good and can actually cause harm.

Within the last 5 minutes, I watched what had to be a marine mammal swimming south. I called my husband to come and see it and he saw the same thing that I did - a black back and fin or tail.

I spotted at least 3 orcas swimming south around the same area in which I had spotted the others I reported. I think there were more, but my field of vision is relatively small, so I only count those whose dorsal fins I've seen above the water at the same time. Amazing! -Tara Klein

Entry 6:
Hood Canal - ~

15:55 -
I'm pretty sure I saw at least two orca fins off the south end of the Hood Canal Bridge. Follow-up: I was driving as a passenger across the bridge and saw what looked like at least two orca fins. If they were orcas, I saw one that would have to be a bull. They were too tall to be any other marine animal. They were large and black, there was a little movement and I saw a flash of white at one point, but there was not as much movement as I would expect. They definitely were not traveling in any particular direction. I could not turn around and drive across the bridge again to confirm what I saw, but I was able to look at it for several seconds before we got out of sight. I posted here as soon as we got off the bridge. -Emily Calkins
