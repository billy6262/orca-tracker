being seen in this area now from shore, somewhere offshore of

12:10-

13:05 - 2 humpbacks southbound
traveling close together, estimating a couple miles from shore, 2 miles
south of Landbank Westside Preserve
. At
12:15 they stopped and for 40 minutes interacted very close to one another, all the while moving farther west away from me. A strong steady wind forced the bright white spray between the whales and my position on shore which obscured their behavior. Many gulls joined them and I assumed they were feeding although I couldn't see their heads lunge upwards. 10 times I saw a fluke high up and then slam sideways onto the surface sending up a huge plume of water and at times I saw 2 flukes up side by side surrounded by huge splashes. At
13:00 they stopped this activity and moved south again until out of sight. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

, mid-channel, doing a lunge and breachfest every 20-30 seconds. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*
Yesterday [10/30/21] was amazing! I had finished my "bird chores" and asked Susan Berta and Briar if they wanted to go for a walk, (Briar is her dog, so never declines an invitation). We were only a few houses away from home when Susan saw
a breaching humpback
! My first HB sighting! I zipped back home to get binoculars, calling out "Humpback" to our neighbors working in the yard. I was worried it would be gone, but when we got back, it continued huge breaches and pec slaps. We watched from the street awhile, then went out to the bluff and saw it from there too. Those pec fins are HUGE and make a big splash. I'm lucky to have my whale whisperer sister, who can spot them even when we aren't looking for them! -Wendy Berta Sines

16:05-~

17:05 -
Wendy and I were taking Briar for a walk and first saw the
humpback at
4:05 pm,
breaching, pec slapping and splashing in mid-Admiralty Inlet. We were about
1 mile south of Bush Point
, the whale was between us and the NW side of the entrance to Hood Canal. We watched it continue to be active for about a half hour, then s/he seemed to go into travel mode for a bit, heading NW toward Bush Pt., then as s/he was passing the southern part of Marrowstone Island the pec slapping and breaching started again! We watched it until about
5:05 pm, as it continued north toward Bush Pt. and out of our site. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Entry 5:
Port Susan -

09:30-

10:30 -
A solo, what I believe is a
Minke
, has been in Port Susan for an hour.

9:30-
10:30 Oct 30th, 2021. It appears to be circling around the tide line so I assume feeding. It's located on a line between Kayak Point pier and Tillicum Beach about half of the way from Kayak Point along that line so half mile off shore. Follow up: It has the curved hook kind of like a dolphin with a distinctive hook, but the creature is much bigger than a dolphin. When you see it out of the water, it's jet black. When we saw the humpback last year, it had lines along the body this appeared to be smooth. Hope that helps. -Paul Belshaw

Entry 6:
Admiralty Inlet -

12:11 -
Just saw two whales from the PT ferry. Mid channel headed north. Couldn't tell if they are
humpback or minke
. -Nick Sue
