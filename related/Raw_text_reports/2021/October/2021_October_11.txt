Orca Sightings for October 11, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T18s; T46B1 & T46B1A; T251, T252, T253 & T253A; T123s)
- We had quite a day watching whales yesterday with lots of variety out near
Race Rocks
, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We were headed out to see the T123 pod from the M.V. Saratoga, Puget Sound Express, when we spotted
2 humpback whales
on our way. One of these whales was
crc15971 (Hydra)
, who was the only one that raised her tail flukes for an ID. Later we cruised over to watch the T123 pod (a family of 4) swimming steadily towards the aforementioned humpback whales. The Bigg's killer whales got within about 250-300 yards of the humpbacks before we peeled away to look for a few other pods nearby. The humpbacks didn't look too concerned about the killer whales presence (which isn't a surprise since the Transients prefer to go after smaller prey around here). Next we watched another pod of 4 Bigg's killer whales - T46B1, T46B1A, T253, ad T253A (thanks to Mark Malleson for ID on 253A who is not in the latest ID guide as a two year old). This group of 4 made a kill shortly after we arrived with the lighthouse at Race Rocks in the background! They ate their meal very quickly before racing off to the east, possibly in pursuit of another meal when we left them. On our way back towards the dock in Edmonds we also spotted the T18 pod (another group of 4) swimming eastbound just a few miles east of all the others. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, PSE

T65As
. -Bonnie Gretz

12:20 -
4-5 Orcas southbound in Saratoga
, seen from near
Race Lagoon
on Whidbey, heading SE towards Camano at

12:20-ish.
---- What a treat to "hear" whales today before seeing them, and lucky one of us was outside to hear them as they passed our house, southbound. But we caught them - the
T65As
- as they headed to mid-channel Saratoga Passage. And a bit later from Hidden Beach. Great way to start the week. -Jill Hein

07:30 -
We saw a
single orca in Saratoga Passage
staying at Cama Beach. Heading north. No other orcas. -Hazel Goodman

South Puget Sound (T137s) -

18:41 -
[orcas] Just passed me on Horsehead Bay heading
southbound out of Carr Inlet
toward Fox Island - lots of bird activity, think I saw about 3.
---- Here's a few of my favourite photos from last night as the Orcas passed by on their way out of the Carr Inlet. Saw 2 for sure, stayed in front of me for about 15/20mins, going under and resurfacing frequently, lots of bird activity overhead. Saw one little tail slap as they headed off! -Jennifer Swenson
*

About
4 Orcas headed south in Carr Inlet
off Cutts Island. -Bill DeLeo
*

15:38 - [orcas]
Just spotted them again in the middle of
Henderson Bay
, slightly closer to Purdy side. The sea lions are still huddled very close to shore on the Gig Harbor side, but are getting driven further out by the tide. Looks like the orcas are just biding their time -Alyssa Carlson Paquette

Updating now, same spot, circling with deep dives, but definitely 4, one being a large male.

1:00pm today, Monday, heading toward Dead Man's Island. [

Found them again. They look to be mulling around
between Purdy Spit and Minter Lagoon
. Closer to the Key Peninsula side.

13:05 - [orcas]
I spotted them about
13:05 south of
Purdy Spit

*

11:15 - Two orcas in Henderson Bay, Carr Inlet
, South Puget Sound, heading north towards Purdy, where I spotted about 8-10 sea lions close to shore. I expected for the hunt to begin, but so far it has been quiet! I'll be watching. -Ingrid Shumway
*

Entry 4:
NPS/Possession Sound - At
09:51
Laura Baker, WSF Marine Ops, emailed to report: Beluga Whale at MUK, 10/11. Yes, Beluga! Vessel reports sighting a
Beluga whale just off the MUK dock heading in a northbound direction, heading toward Everett
.
*

09:23 - Beluga Sighting on the east side of Possession Sound
heading north
between Picnic Point Park and Mukilteo Lighthouse Park
. No boats or observers in the area. Follow-up: Observed with binoculars so no pictures or video. I had not seen the reports of a Beluga in the Sound until I looked it up after the observation. I would say 100% confident it was a Beluga. Large white with no dorsal. Swam near service for several minutes before submerging and staying under. -Joe Finco

Entry 5:
Strait of Juan de Fuca
- A very special family Thanks Giving today! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

ID: GS

Entry 6:
18:00 I saw two blows from Constellation Park
in West Seattle; mid channel
line of sight to Blake Island
. Hasn't resurfaced but was unmistakably
backlit cetacean blows
. One more blow clearly east of mid channel at
18:10. Never did see the animal. Follow-up: I'd say it looked similar to orcas blows [height], which I'm most familiar with, but obviously not an orca with
no fin visible
. -Jason Lee Bell
[
Possible sighting not reported as any species, but
Beluga
ended up south next day so possibly? -alb
