Orca Sightings for November 11, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
09:00 - Killer whales right outside of Friday Harbor
. Comes from a reliable source. At least one big male that he saw but did not have time to hang around. They/it was headed north. -James Mead Maya

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound - ~

14:00 -
I saw what I believe to be
a gray whale
between Anderson Island and very close to the
DuPont
shore line around
14:00hrs. The whale slowly went north and south in about a half mile circle. The water was no more than 20 ft. deep in that area with the tide being high at the time. I could see sediment come up with the whale as it surfaced to breath. I assumed a type of feeding behavior. It did this for at least 20 minutes while I sat on the ground, in the rain, with a stupid smile on my face, that's still here right now. -Stan Fields

I spotted this guy/gal at the beach at the end of Sequalitchew [Creek] Trail [
DuPont
]. It was about 1300. Follow-up: I forgot to mention that the whale wasn't moving in one particular direction. I was walking with the whale down one-way just following him while taking video, and then he busted a U I went back the other way. My neighbors reported he was still there after I had left for at least an hour or two. -Krista PlantPusher

Entry 3:
Central Puget Sound -

14:05 - Grey whale, Pier 70
, pointed north. Very small animal, likely 1-2 years old. Super low-profile surfacing, and staying really shallow during dives. -David Scott

14:03 -
Sitting near
Pike's market
, just saw a large all black whale off
Pier 68
heading north. -Vickie Cariello
*

13:45 - [gray]
I believe I saw this same whale from the aquarium deck around
1:45pm today - I saw the heart-shaped blow and also thought it looked small. But it was a ways out. (Pier 59). -Juliana Tadano
*

11:45 -
Natira McGee reported seeing what they thought was a humpback heading southwest from
Alki
while dining at a cafe. In following up with her, she says
could have been a gray
; they didn't get a good look just saw the spouting.

09:30AM - Gray Whale off Point Williams, West Seattle
, this morning around
9:30. Slowly moving north about 100 to 200 yards off shore. Several "heart" shaped blows were seen. Follow-up: Sadly, no images. All I can tell you is the whale was much bigger than an Orca, although when surfacing it did not show full body length in one moment. When blowing, it clearly showed two blow holes. -Stephen Nielsen
