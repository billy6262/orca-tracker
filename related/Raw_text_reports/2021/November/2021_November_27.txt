November 27: After spending Thanksgiving Day in Puget Sound, a spread-out
J-pod filtered north in Admiralty Inlet
in choppy seas, exiting mid-afternoon. Although there was some foraging along the way, the orcas wasted no time after passing
Bush Point
in maintaining a consistent pace as they headed toward more open water. We look forward to welcoming them back again soon after an uplifting few days of their inspiring presence. (Photos Richard Snowberger) -Sandra Pollard

Saw big male mid
Double Bluff Beach Park

Confirmed
J-pod off Mutiny Bay
very spread out and multi directional. We are slowly making our way around them very carefully to pass them by. It looks like the northernmost orcas are
off Mutiny Bay just south of Double Bluff
. Good luck out there from shore everyone. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound (pos. T46s +) -

14:58 -
Just spotted a pod - 6 at last count but not certain of number - passing me by on Horsehead Bay
heading north toward Raft Island
. At least one male. Moving quickly, lots of seals all around them but they haven't slowed down. They only surfaced briefly when they were close to me, most of the pictures were taken from a good distance away and are heavily cropped.
---- Here's a few that I managed to catch as they passed by me earlier - unfortunately couldn't get great quality pictures due to rain, dull conditions but definitely counted 6! What an amazing surprise - didn't expect to see them out here at all! Taken at
2:55pm, Horsehead Bay heading north towards Raft Island. ["
T046s and others
" -Brendon Bissonnette] -Jennifer Swenson

South Puget Sound -
Also, reports had Shrimp in the bay from 12-3 for sure [including some]:

Shrimp, the
Gray at Marina
at 2pm 11-27-2021. It even went into the empty slips on the endï¿½

12:30 -
It's presently feeding just off the south end of
Cole Pt
. Watching from the brickyard. I can add a few more details. It was anywhere from 50-100ft from the end of Cole Point. We watched it dive to feed 5 times. Each time it was down for roughly 3 minutes. It would take 3-4 breaths between dives. Saw the fluke twice. Left at
12:30. -Reports relayed by Belen Schneider
