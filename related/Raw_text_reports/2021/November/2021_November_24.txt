Been watching some blows periodically from Kitsap side at

*

14:20 -
Last saw them around
14:20
heading south
pretty quickly. Lost them since then.

14:04 -
From where I'm at, it looks like they're at
Scatchet Head
now.

13:56 -
Still trending south, hugging closely on the Whidbey side.
South end of Possession Point
. Waiting to see what direction they will go. Viewing from Sunset Avenue in Edmonds. Too far out to see with the naked eye, need binoculars. Two boats with them. -Tamara Kelley-Woods
*

14:09 -
Getting very active. Breaching, etc.

13:36 -
Approaching the green buoy
south of Possession Point
.

12:54 - [orca]
Viewing from Picnic Point. They're coming in to better view now with a white boat following behind them for sure this time. Still. SB and closely grouped.
----Two really not great photos of breaching
J pod
members
south of Possession Point
. I was viewing from Picnic Point, with my lens at 600mm, and still could barely see them. So glad to have been able to see them yesterday and share that experience with the few others that joined me on the bridge. -Matty Leaman

12:01 - [orca]
Mid channel still
moving south
. Past ferry lanes now. -Alina Chris Sherrett

15:00 -
Last laid eyes on them in same general area, they looked to be foraging some. Heading home to warmth. Good luck.

14:50 -
They appear to have stalled. Making some directional changes. They are as Marilyn described in her
14:33 post, due south of
Scatchet Head
, Whidbey - wide expanse Possession triangle . Definitely need binoculars, even then can be difficult to see.

14:19 -
Still grouped, appear in resting so maybe not everyone woke up. In resting travel mode continuing southwesterly, still east of
Scatchet Head
green buoy.

14:08 -
They are waking up! Breachfest south of
Possession Pt./Cultus Bay
. Pod has been trending slightly southwesterly. From high elevation at Stamm Overlook, Edmonds.

13:15 -
From south Mukilteo with elevation. Seeing leaders approaching
Possession Point steady southbound
west of mid channel. (They are currently heading toward and north of the sailboat with colored sail coming from the south and well away from the pod). At this time appears they are staying course toward Edmonds.

12:15 -
Seeing what looks to be 20-24 orcas here, including 4 noticeable males, In resting line with some large groups breaking surface at once. Breathtaking! All steady southbound nearing Glendale, Whidbey.

12:05 -
Stunning, even from across the waterway! Now with elevation (above Mukilteo beach) can see entire group tightly bunched steady southbound now south of all the homes heading toward Glendale. Very much in Whidbey side. Numbers look good for all of J pod.

11:55 - [orca]
Beautiful group of fins steady
southbound
, Whidbey side, halfway down houses along
Clinton
, south of ferry terminal. Elevated viewing would be best from mainland side. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Whale Happy Thanksgiving! 11/24 with dear
J pod
!!! Ran all the way down to
Clinton/Brighton Beach
and saw them a bit far out but so lovely to see the whole family, grouped up....so many big and little fins together!!! They headed
past the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes
and we watched them mid-channel from
Glendale Beach
. -Bonnie Gretz

*

11:31 -
and I'm thankful for lunchtime passes.
J Pod
close in to Whidbey in leisure travel mode in small tight knit groups. I need a whale bell which would be more pleasant than me screaming "ORCAS!" for all my neighbors to hear. I feel like a kid again. It's been way too long seeing these amazing beings. -Debbie Stewart

towards Clinton ferry just passing

----
November 24, 2021: A feast for the eyes and the soul - that's the only way of describing today's gift, on the eve of Thanksgiving, of a welcome visit by J-pod. Avid whale-watchers, hungry for a glimpse - or more - of this mesmerizing population of orcas, enjoyed many hours of quality whale watching from the shores of Whidbey Island. After passing through the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes early
in the morning, the whales made their way north
in ones and twos into Saratoga Passage, foraging along the way, before
turning back south
and picking up the pace as they closed ranks and assembled in their family groups. Seeing them traveling in perfect symmetry with one another, against a backdrop of snow-dusted mountains, was a sight to behold as they passed Brighton beach and Glendale on their return journey toward Possession Point and beyond.

11:27 -
All have passed south of

09:37 -

Sandy Point NB
. Should be getting close to Langley soon. b.o.c.

10:17 -
Looks like the group has turned around and is heading SE towards
Sandy Point
and out of Saratoga Passage. One is still over by Camano. >

09:28 - They are
heading NW up Saratoga Passage
mid-channel but tending closer to Camano.

09:19 - [orca]
They are splashing around right at
Sandy Point
. Not sure if they are hunting but their general direction seems to be
heading NW
into Saratoga Passage. -Luanne Seymour
*

09:03 -
Can see one male
south of Langley
. -Rachael Kvig
*

11:12 -
David Haeckel called. Group of them watching from
Brighton Beach
and see
J pod
members (at least a dozen) tightly grouped between them and
Hat Island
, they thought closer to Hat. Still heading southbound.

10:43 - At Brighton Beach
. They are directional south coming toward us.

10:17 -
Heading south fast!
South of Camano
now with a small boat behind them!

09:05 -
David Haeckel called back to report at least 1-2 of the orcas have entered Saratoga Passage heading
northbound
. One breached - others are still out in the middle waters between south Whidbey and Camano Head. He's on the bluffs above Sandy Point with Sandra Pollard and Donna George who thinks she sees an open saddle patch.

08:50 -
They are near
Sandy Point
now in the triangle!

08:47 -
David Haeckel called to report some of the orcas are between
Sandy Point
and closer to tip of Camano Island. Couple leaders out in middle of triangle look to be milling - glimpsed spyhop and some porpoising. Couple of slow movers. Viewing from a distance so can't confirm any open saddle patches.
----What an amazing day watching our beloved
J Pod
of the Southern Resident Killer Whales! What a treat to enjoy the day before Thanksgiving with Orca friends! Enjoy the pictures, mostly taken from Brighton Beach area and above Sandy Point. b.o.c. photo -

12:37 -
Just passing Glendale now. Mid channel if not a little closer to Whidbey. Still tightly grouped
heading south
.

11:44 -
So pretty. Just passed the Clinton ferry dock very close into Whidbey.
Heading south
.

11:26 -
Just getting ready to pass the
Clinton ferry
dock heading south.

11:12 -
Back in my view again. All grouped up in travel mode heading south. Closer to Whidbey side. Viewing from above the Clinton ferry dock.

08:28 -
Still seeing quite a few
northwest of Hat Island
. Still traveling north and west. That is about the limit from my viewpoint here.

08:08 -
Seeing them all along this line. Very spread out. Some milling activity and directional changes but northbound progress.

08:02 -
I am thinking one of the resident pods based on how many whales I am seeing. They are still passing the ferry slip and then hugging the shore of Hat Island. I'm up to about 12-13 whales now.

07:59 -
So I'm seeing multiple groups of orcas spread out. 2 males leading. 2-3 smaller group of 2-3 orcas trailing. Let me get bundled up and head outside for a better view.

07:56 - Straight out from the ferry dock heading north. Looking to pass between Hat and Whidbey. In slow travel mode. I have yet to see any males but I'll keep looking.
---- Here is the best video I was able to get of the close pass by the Clinton Ferry Dock by J-Pod on 11/24/21. Happy Whalesgiving!!!! - https://www.facebook.com/OrcaNetwork/posts/10166180750275601 - Danielle Pennington

01:00,
11:00, & ~

23:45 -
had a report at 11am at
Cole Point
(other side of Oro Bay) and Paige DaSaro Banks messaged me a confirmed time of 1am this morning that she heard it in closer proximity, so it seemed like it was circling the bay. That's notable because that was at the lowest of low tide. Paige lives on the east bank near Cole Point, and she's the one that's hearing it at low tide every night, close which to shore that she hears blows and water splashing. It happened again last night [11/24] around
11:45pm. -Belen Schneider
