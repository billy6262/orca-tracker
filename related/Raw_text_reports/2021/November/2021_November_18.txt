Spread out and traveling quickly in small groups,
all 17 members of J-Pod northbound 1 mile south of Landbank Westside Preserve
. A large male was the leader but too far out to identify. A few ventured closer in and saddle patches could more easily be seen.

then 20 minutes later
J41 Eclipse withJ 58 Crescent. J58
bounced high out of the water and kept up with her Mother's fast pace. At

Entry 2:
possible that I saw a minke whale at Dune Peninsula
in Tacoma today,

8:45am
? I heard a blow and saw a hooked dorsal fin, gray back. It surfaced so quickly and was moving fast. I saw it surface once more, but too far away to ID. Just curious in case anyone else might have seen it. Follow-up: I saw just the back surfacing. It was moving fast when I saw it, headed west along Dune Peninsula. I saw it headed west through the Point Defiance ferry lane. It wasn't an orca or a harbor porpoise. Maybe 15'-18' long? Hard to tell. But the
dorsal fin was that sickle shape
and the size of my hand and forearm. -Nathalie op de Beeck

Entry 3:
9:00 am
on Thursday, Nov 18th, on the
east side of Eld Inlet
across from Flapjack Point, I heard a seal barking loudly. I went out and saw the seal surface a few times, barking, then disappear and saw a
single small Orca fin
surface for a moment and then they all disappeared and I saw nothing further. Follow-up: Well after I sent the report, I saw a posting on next door about a seal in our inlet who had gotten trapped in some netting. It
could have been the seal
with his fin poking up. It was a distance from me. The seal was distressed. Others reported the seal so hopefully someone was able to help. There definitely was a pod of orcas feeding on seal here in August, but I would say it wasn't what I saw yesterday. -Margie Wark
