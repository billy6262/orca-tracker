BELUGA - unconfirmed - Tue, Nov 2 - Anacortes - Erin Gless, PWWA, texted that a water taxi captain in Anacortes thinks he may have seen a beluga in Burrows Pass, Anacortes, shortly after
13:00 today,
November 2nd, heading out. When I [Alisa] asked Erin his level of confidence, she said no not yet, she just knows he (Capt.) was going in and asked if "we get belugas around here". He had to leave so Erin went over and scouted from highest point, but did not see the whale. If whale rounded the corner and headed into Rosario, she would not have seen it.
