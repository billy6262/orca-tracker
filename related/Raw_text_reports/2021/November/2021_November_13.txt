Orca Sightings for November 13, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Gulf Islands, B.C. (Js)
- It was a gorgeous calm morning and we had no idea J pod was incoming
(north into the Strait of Georgia
). We were sitting outside taking advantage of a dry calm morning when we heard whale blows in the distance heading our way!

confirmed to be Jpod by Brendon Bissonette. -Rachelle Hayden, SSOS

Entry 2:
~
10:00
while out surfing off
Newport, OR
, near the south jetty/south beach area, pretty close to high tide, ~2 hours into ebb. Stated he was
80% sure he spotted a beluga whale
which seemed very strange, but then he found/read the article on the beluga in Puget Sound. He reports, seemed to be on its own, it surfaced probably 100 feet from him, head & face came out of the water. Head had such a distinct beluga head & face, and animal was white. Says he doesn't know any other porpoise or dolphin with those features, definitely not a seal. Approximately 13-14 feet in length. Came up for a moment, saw its head then submerged. Pretty close to shore, just outside where waves were breaking.
