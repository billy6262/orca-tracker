I got to spend about 30 minutes with our gray friend today. -Belen Schneider
*

10:45 -
the whale is actively in front of Paige's [
DaSaro Banks
] house on the east side now at
10:45. Distance wise, she estimated its a couple hundred yards out from her bulkhead. So, I got more info on a couple of things: Paige lives on the east bank near Cole Point, and she's the one that's hearing it at low tide every night, close which to shore that she hears blows and water splashing. It happened again last night [Nov 24] around
11:45pm. Map of her location below that I'm comparing to the topographical map. And someone in the same area (East side where the bluffs are) caught video of it at
8:45 this morning [Nov 25] and posted it to Puget Sound Whale Watching on FB. via Belen Schneider
