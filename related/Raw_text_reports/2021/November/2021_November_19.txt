When we set out on MV Saratoga from Edmonds, we never know what we're going to find on the Salish Sea! Today was a wild adventure that first took us
north to Race Rocks near Victoria
, BC where we encountered
3 Humpback Whales including BCX1239 "Towers" and her calf
. We were well on our way home when we suddenly encountered the
T68 pod of Transient Killer Whales near Marrowstone Island
in Puget Sound! This was the entire extended family of
matriarch T68 including her adult son T68A and her daughters T68B and T68C with their offspring.
