Orca Sightings for July 1, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (K pod) -

17:29 - [orcas
] A few are now on the other side of
Eagle Point
... the south side. And there are some still here on the north side of Eagle Point. Everybody's just hanging out. Moving slow. -Chris Wilson
*

16:08 -
Visible from
Land Bank
. ["I was at Land Bank and saw them turn around right before Edwards Point…" -Ellie Sawyer]

15:20 - [orcas] Past Eagle Cove
at
15:20, spread out, some offshore, some close in, some laggers. Moving up island. -Fred Horn
*

11:57 -
Elizabeth Drozda called back to report 2nd group of
2 orcas
. She was still watching the first group of 3 about 1/2 mile offshore when she heard whales below her. This 2nd group of 2 are hanging out below along shoreline below here at Sares Head, Sharpes Pt. Park, north of Deception Pass Bridge. They are milling around, looks like they are fishing/feeding.

11:27 -
Elizabeth Drozda just called. She's at Sares Head,
south of Anacortes
watching the whales go by, believes the resident orcas per our alert. The orcas are still north of Deception Pass, somewhat spread out heading south. Only seeing 3 at this time in this group.

Center for Whale Research Encounter #45: "… We made it on scene at the
south end of Rosario Strait
by 1050 about mid-strait off Watmough Head. The whales were very spread out and foraging. … From the whales we had been seeing, we knew we had the
K12, K13, and K14 matrilines
present. While we felt confident at that point that the
K16s and K21 were not present
, we still needed to find the rest of the K14s and K43. We eventually spotted
K26
off the flagpole at
American Camp
. He was also charging up island but then found a fish and stopped to give chase. We briefly saw
K14 and K36
inshore up closer to
Eagle Point
. We then had a couple of backlit whales speed past us heading north. This was
K43 and K44
and they started milling too. …..
K12
looked like she might have been chasing a salmon before she continued slowly southeast about a mile northwest of Eagle Point. We ended the encounter there at 1707 after
K12
arched and gave us a nice right side shot." [See CWR Encounter #45 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-45 for full summary and more photos]

14:00 - Iceberg Point westbound
.

11:45 - Southbound near Deception Pass
, Whidbey Island.

09:45 -
About 10 orcas
southbound in Rosario near Decatur
, early reports sound like this may be Southern Residents!!! After a tentative report from a couple days ago in Johnstone Strait we are guessing maybe members of K-Pod, same exact day they showed up last year!
---- After 81 consecutive days of no Southern Residents in the Salish Sea, members of
K-Pod returned this morning
, one year to the day after they made their return in 2020. Their whereabouts have been unknown since their last visit to the Salish Sea in mid-late February. The whales were picked up this morning heading south in
Rosario Strait
and made their way over to Haro Strait in the afternoon. We saw members of the
K12s, K13s, and K14s
(last year just the K12s and K13s were here on
July 1). We had a hunch they would show up today after getting a tentative report of them in Johnstone Strait on
June 29, again exactly one year after they were documented there in 2020. [video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjGKY41zb9Q -Orca Behavior Institute

09:34 -
Saw
two orcas
, on ferry to San Juan, somewhere in the
Rosario Strait
. Sorry, I'm not sure [which direction] but they were swimming away from the port side at that time so possibly SB. Not a lot of action though. They didn't spend much time above water for the handful of times they surfaced. -Tóm Và
