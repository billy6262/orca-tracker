Watched a
lone Gray Whale
travel into
Port Susan
Saturday,
July 17th, from about

6:10 -
6:35 AM from the Camano side. The whale was observed from a high bluff on the east side of Camano Island travelling from south to north about 1000 yards offshore about a half mile south of Tyee Beach. Observed the whale progressively travelling over several sequences of 2-4 routine blows followed by deeper dives with at least partial fluke exposures. This whale appeared fairly dark above compared to the typical "Sounders" that we've observed over the past several years here, and with a relatively light, non-distinctive accumulation of barnacles and lice on the visible left side. The size seemed to be about typical for the Grays we've seen from here. -Don Rosie, Camano Island
