Orca Sightings for July 11, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Rosario Strait/Deception Pass (T37As)
- …we had a negative tide with a 10ft tidal exchange and the currents at the pass are FAST. I saw boats spinning out there. These currents stopped 2-ton orcas, and believe me these orcas are powerful...They spent approx. 2 hrs fighting it. They would try both the main bridge pass, and then over to Canoe Pass, northend bridge...they finally gave up and swam back east a few miles into a bay. I think Miller Bay, and rested until waters calmed down around 6 pm. It was crazy, it was amazing to watch this. Im still over the moon....photo - "Strawberry Island just east of the bridge" - photo - "from 2-4pm, this is about as far as they could get. Same spot, but currents slowly moving them backwards as they are swimming forward." -Marilyn Armbruster

This is the
T37A family
(Transients/Bigg's - Mammal Eating Type) Was so cool to share these exciting moments with many people on the bridge seeing whales for the first time. They were certainly treated to something special. -Dori Dace

18:08 - [orcas]
Yes, they're still in the
Miller Bay
area. -Kimberly Beck

18:45 -
…finally going under the bridge around
6:45. I had been watching them since
4:05 from Pass Island. They took a deep breath from the opening of the channel and didn't surface until they were right under the bridge. But one young one surprised us by surfacing twice right in front of us before joining the rest!

19:00 -
They went thru Deception Pass and are now off
Rosario Head
. Milling, resting, it looks like. 8 hours later in the same exact spot I found them to start the day. Starting to trend slowly west.

18:00 - Westbound nearing Yokeko Point
, headed towards the bridge. The current in the pass has calmed way down, and they should be able to exit with ease if they want.

15:45 -
Still in same spot east of bridge. They have gone over to Canoe Pass twice but turned back to try to head west out Deception Pass. Getting nowhere.

15:00 -
They have been surfacing in the current just east of the bridge. Been going on about 20 minutes surfacing in roughly same spot fighting the current it seems.

13:30 - Northbound past Ala Spit.

12:45 -
Appears whales have flipped northbound hugging Whidbey shore headed back
towards Ala Spit
.

12:25 -
IE5 and another boat honked repeatedly to stop a boat from running right over the whales. Group still
southbound past Ala Spit
.

11:00-

11:30 -
Viewed from Rosario Head, southbound close to shore, spyhops, likely on a hunt behind Northwest Island out of my view. Continued rapidly south and then eastbound under Deception Pass Bridge. Many, many people in both locations got wonderful looks at this family of whales from shore on this beautiful day. I missed the actual swim under the bridge by 90 seconds. -Rachel Haight

Entry 2:
North Puget Sound
(T36A2 and T36A3, T65As minus T65A5, T137s) - Let's porpoise - that was the order on a sunny, Sunday afternoon near the Clinton ferry dock when the
T65As (minus 65A5
I believe - thanks Bart Rulon),
T137s, T36A2 and T36A3
suddenly zipped into high gear after hunting for lunch, whipping through the whitecaps as they propelled themselves at speed through the ferry lanes,. They slackened off the pace as they passed Glendale beach and Possession boat ramp before filtering into Possession Triangle and slipping away south, still tightly grouped.

Every time I'm ready to say they're heading back south, I stop short. While overall trend last 30 mins or so is just slightly south of the northernmost point they reached, they keep milling around. The tight group and large grouping of dorsals is breathtaking. -Debbie Stewart

They started porpoising hard and swimming so fast and made a kill right in the ferry dock. They are so close to Whidbey. Best orcas experience of my life. Heading southbound.

14:12 -
Still in the same general area just off the Clinton ferry dock. Directional changes and not really committed to any travel just yet. Long down times in between a lot of surface activity.

13:46 -
Stalled at the
Clinton ferry dock
. Trending northbound but it seems they stalled for a hunt again.

13:35 - Picking up pace now. Viewing from Clinton just passing the south most ferry slip. Very close in to Whidbey.

Still displaying directional changes with slightly northbound travel. Just crossing the ferry lanes heading north, slightly on the Mukilteo side to mid channel.

12:24 - [orcas] Large group resumed northbound
travel just getting ready to cross the

Ts are

a few miles south of Mukilteo mid-channel. A few orcas may be way out in front by the ferry lanes still.

.

10:12 -
Bart Rulon texted: relocated the orcas who are now off Edmonds. As of
10:05 they are north of the ferry terminal northbound. IDs: T65As, T137s, T36A2 and T36A3 are all here. Minus 65A5 so far.
----The pictures were taken a few miles away from Edmonds on the MV Saratoga, Puget Sound Express, Saturday afternoon around
4:45pm. In rapid order these 11 orcas caught at least one porpoise, and maybe two, south of
Possession Poin
t. After circling on their meal(s) for about 30 minutes they celebrated as Bigg's killer whales often do with breaches and cartwheels. T137A, Jack, was particularly breachy (6 times) in this encounter! All photos were taken using a super-telephoto lens, and cropped, and all whale watching regulations were followed. -Bart Rulon
