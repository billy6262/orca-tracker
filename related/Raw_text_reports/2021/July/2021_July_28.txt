============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCAS - Wed,

Entry 2:
~

17:00-~

18:30 -
I live on the beach just east of
Otter Point
, and I saw many orca on

Entry 3:
6:30 pm. They must have been feeding, as they don't usually stay in this area too long, and usually run by this area quite fast, but not this time. At first, I thought, maybe 20 orca, which is a really large number (for here), but, now, I think there were many more, due to the length of time that they continued to pass by me. Every time, I thought it was over, then more came. This was the first time I've seen them this year. It was a spectacular show. They were all over the place. Some close to shore, maybe 200 feet off my beach. These ones, were mostly in pairs and threes, and heading west, and running fast to Otter Point. Some were maybe a mile off shore, and some far offshore (4-5 miles?). They were heading west. There was lots of breeching (mostly the ones way offshore), but I did see one breech maybe 1/2 mile offshore. I was so happy and excited to see them, I phoned 2 of my neighbours so they could see them too! Really glad I got to see it, and thankfully, they came back again. I have no photos to confirm this, as I found out a long time ago, that the whales usually go by too fast, and it is better to just enjoy and watch. -Lynda J

11:30 -
Grouped up, now past point Robinson, playful, closer to Vashon shores but moving to mid-channel, long dives, steady
southbound
. ---- We watched from the early morning as they passed the north end of the Island. They were mostly out of camera range, but was able to snag a far away picture of a hunt in progress as they took down a harbor porpoise for breakfast. Switching quickly to binocs, we watched as they formed a big loose circle around Callisto/T65A6 and let her work at finishing the kill. It took her awhile as she valiantly chased and gave wild tail slaps as her family looked on then finally joined to share the meal and moved southbound after a bit. So cool to witness that teaching moment! Once they hit Point Robinson they were grouped up and was more playful than usual after having just feasted and were throwing flukes, rubbing and tousling as they surfaced and passed. Mama was right in the middle loving on her babies, it was very sweet. It was quite boat heavy at the Point, and they had to navigate through a maze of motors and took to long dives as they moved southbound. Love that family so much, it was a great day! -Marla Smith
*
I had an epic visit from my favorite Bigg's family, the
T65A's
. They hunted extremely far away from the beach, but I was able to witness the incredible power these orcas display while hunting. That little Harbor porpoise did not stand a chance. All [photos] were taken from shore on 7/28/21, and heavily cropped. -Kelly Burns Keenan
