HUMPBACK WHALES - Thu,

Entry 3:
Elliott Bay -

20:11
- Just spotted them surface off Alki Beach from kayak. There's
two animals
... not sure what the other one is... FYI think it was a humpback and her calf, definitely saw the distinct dorsal fin! I was probably about half a mile out. The whales were generally moving west to east in the southern part of Elliott Bay, getting a bit closer to the beach on Alki at times. I thought it was weird at the time since I went out expecting to see one whale [gray] and there was two. One was also much smaller than the other, as well, and I saw their dorsal fins very clearly when they surfaced. Wish I had a more positive ID/photo for you but that's what I saw. -Meagan Maxon
