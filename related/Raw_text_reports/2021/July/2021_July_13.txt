----Here's the 7/13 pass up Colvos. Didn't get any pics of Jack as he hugged the Kitsap shore due to the heat haze, but could see him clearly through binocs traveling with a couple smaller fins. The bigger group surprised me as all the sudden they appeared to the south of me, then took a long deep dive on their approach to try and shake off some boats and reappeared well to the north of me with those gorgeous sun-drenched fins rising above the Salish. Love those matrilines so much, always an impressive and heartwarming sight to see them together! -Marla Smith
