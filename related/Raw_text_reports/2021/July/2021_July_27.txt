Orca Sightings for July 27, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCAS - Tue,

Entry 2:
Haro Strait from Strait of Juan de Fuca
- You can't have too many baby pictures, right? Look who many of us got to meet tonight,
L125
, the newest member of the Southern Resident Killer Whales! It was an amazing evening on the westside. So lovely to see all of those beautiful open saddle patches. We watched
members of K & L pods
foraging for Salmon for a few hours. We hope they find enough food to keep them in their core summer habitat for more than just a day. This has been their first "real" visit since February for some and
April 10th for others. No fish, no blackfish. All photos taken from shore - 600mm lens and cropped! -Alison Engle

21:00 -
Small group of orcas, about 200 yds off
Hannah Heights
on SJI (that's part way between the Land Bank Westside Preserve and Pile Point). They swam rapidly in varied directions, then moved down island. By
21:00, they were past Pile Point. -Michael Noonan

Our Education/Events/Advocacy coordinator Cindy Hansen spent part of her evening last night with
members of J, K, & L pods
(endangered Southern Residents) off the west side of San Juan Island. Here is a very lovely moment in time she shares with us all! [video: https://www.facebook.com/OrcaNetwork/posts/10165813096905601]
*
----After 108 days without J-Pod and more than three weeks with no Southern Residents in the Salish Sea, members of all three pods returned to inland waters today and reached the
west side of San Juan Island
this evening. It was an incredible moment when shortly after we started hearing
calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone
, the dense fog suddenly parted to reveal the whales approaching across Haro Strait. We did not get a full assessment of who all was present, though it was easily 40+ whales and we did confirm Js, Ks, and Ls. They headed south this evening towards Eagle Point at dusk.

20:35-

20:45 - 5-6 more southbound from Edwards Point
including the best of the evening, young
L125
in the lead. Quickly traveling with 3 females and a large male, L125 was bounding out of the water, arching her strong body up over and over as she passed by me with
L109 Takoda and L55 Nugget
, members of the L4 matriline.

20:10-

20:25 - 12-14 Southern Residents
, maybe more, southbound. a tight group of 4 closer in, porpoising over and over at high speed, lunging high out of the water.

20:00 - 4 orcas
far out, southbound at
Edwards Point
. Lots of splashing.

19:55-

20:05 - Northbound
, approaching Edwards Point, 4-5 orcas spread out, one taking a break to lie on its side, dorsal up. Much splashing in the western sunlight. Turning south again at
20:00.

19:23-

19:35 - 12-14 Southern Resident orcas southbound at Edwards Point
. Traveling quickly in small groups spread out. One taking time to cartwheel next to its companion on its back, belly up. This group included a youngster, 3-4 large males. Some milling for a few minutes, a half-breach, but generally quickly southbound. In the glancing sun, every blow illuminated with the fog bank in the distance. Very beautiful.
K20 Spock and K 28 Comet
seen but with choppy waves and distance, IDs didn't come easy.

18:50-

19:05 -
One orca, a large male, northbound followed by 4 others including a second large male approaching
Edwards Point
(just south of Landbank). Milling for a few minutes with a tail lob. I think these are transients but are too far away to get a good look. Fins seem like transient fins.

18:45 -
After hearing calls on the LK hydrophone the fo bank begins to recede!

On the 27th, we had a third siting on the far side of Haro Strait. I first spotted them around

southeast side of Vancouver Island
. They continued on up. There were a bunch of boats following them but it was difficult to see how many there were due to the white caps out thereâ€¦-Justas Vilgalys

Cattle Point in Victoria

bringing up the rear.

13:37 -
Seeing splashes and spy-hop from Shore Meadows. Whales on Whidbey side. Steady
northbound
.
----The T65As always keep whale watchers guessing when they're in Admiralty Inlet, wondering whether they'll slip off down the Hood Canal, which seems to be a favored spot. Today they chose to keep going northbound (for a while anyway), passing
close to Bush Point and beyond to Lagoon Point
, before apparently changing direction and
heading back south
closer to Marrowstone Island. -Sandra Pollard
*

13:31 - [orcas]
Viewing from Robinson Beach (Whidbey), have passed

UNIDENTIFIED ORCAS - Fri,

Entry 7:
12:56 -
Definitely heard a few
calls
under the boat noise, unsure of ID. (follow-up: About 70% certain, but they didn't stick around for long. Possible they were Ts somewhere offshore?)

12:48 -
Hearing what may be faint
calls on the LK hydrophone
. -Morgan Dale
