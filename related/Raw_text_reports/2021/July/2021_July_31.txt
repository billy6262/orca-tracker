We had double sightings today, right by the shore off
Mayne Island
on the Strait of Georgia. First, 3 orcas came by at
2:15pm and headed toward Saturna. Then 3 orcas came at
7:30pm in the opposite direction, also close to shore. They did not bother the seals in either case and seals remained peaceful on the rocks. Seals always seem to know if there is danger or not. Could they be the same group? The final photos are the second group a few minutes later off the Mayne Island Lighthouse in the sunset light. -Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island
