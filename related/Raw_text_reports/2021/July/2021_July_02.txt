Orca Sightings for July 2, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCAS - Fri,

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (K pod) -

We just got word that
Ks are westbound out the Strait of Juan de Fuca
this afternoon. -Orca Behavior Institute

BIGG'S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Fri,

Entry 3:
Texada Island
. An amazing encounter with two Humpbacks chasing three matrilines of Bigg's Killer Whales. We were fortunate to come across
two humpbacks in close proximity of 13 Bigg's Killer Whales
that seemed quite agitated. The humpbacks were following 50 meters behind a group of 13 killer whales tail lobbing and trumpeting. The Bigg's Killer Whales left the area at a high rate of speed and the humpbacks then settled down. We are able to identify one of the Humpbacks as Anvil who frequents the waters of the Salish Sea and has been documented doing the same thing on separate occasions with Bigg's Killer Whales. The families of Bigg's Killer Whales present were the T034's T037's and the T046's. -Ocean EcoVentures Whale Watching - Cowichan Bay & Parksville B.C.
