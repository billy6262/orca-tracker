15:00-

15:10 - 3 members of the T101s
, including 2 large males, northbound 1/2 mile
south of Landbank
. The trio hugged the shore as they retraced their path from last night's trip down island. 200 - 300" from shore, they moved efficiently past Edwards Point and out of sight. Wildfire smoke made for hazy viewing and flat grey seas. The orcas were, in a word, beautiful! Photographed from shore, images cropped. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

16:23 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #51: "… At
13:10, the team arrived on scene southwest of
False Bay
, with a group of 4 whales. The team identified the whales as
T101, T101A, and T101B
, with a single extra whale, all headed slowly southeast following the San Juan shoreline. After reviewing photos, the team later identified the extra whale as
T77C
, who had been travelling with his sister T77D and T49A2 for the last few days, but had apparently broken off from these two to visit with the T101s. [See CWR Encounter #51 for full summary and photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-51

Now being reported as
20 Ts
(!!!)
heading north towards Eagle Point

*

11:45 - T65As
reported to be present.

11:40 -
Here at South Beach. Very smoky, hard to see much. I'd guess about 4 miles off. VHF reports lots of direction changes.

11:00 - [orcas]
7 miles south of
Eagle Cove
. Moving west. Too smoky to see much yet. -Fred Horn
*

Entry 6:
18:10 - Single whale off of
Pier 59
. Moved north a little and then headed south
toward Coleman dock
. Long downtimes.
6:10am (follow-up: I'm far from an expert, but appeared too large to be an orca, it
had a dorsal
that was more prominent than a humpback and yet less than even a female orca. Coloration was almost black, no barnacles or texture like a gray would have. If I had to make a guess, I'd say Minke? There were two WSF ferries and two Kitsap fast ferries present at the time…-Kev Harnax

Unfortunately I do not have a photo, but this morning at around 10am while fishing, I saw a humpback whale surface. It was heading south and I was about 150 yards off the
oil dock at Point Wells between Edmonds and Richmond Beach
. I am 99% sure it was a humpback, as I have seen many of them in my years in Maui. It had the dorsal fin of a humpback. I know grays are common in Puget Sound, and I have witnessed them many times. This was not a gray whale. Was very exciting. It was only about 30 feet away from us. -Ryan Murray
