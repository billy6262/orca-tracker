Center for Whale Research Encounter #54: "… Michael and Charli arrived on scene at
12:46 near
Yellow Island
. When they arrived the whales had split into two groups, with
T19B and T19
near the team and T18 and T19C much further east and out of sight. The team took some time to get the lay of the land, as the whales bounced between the several small islands in the area.
At

13:15
, the eastern whales barreled west to meet up with the others. When the whales came together, the team took the opportunity to launch their research drone and begin some behavioral sampling. After joining up, the whales headed west across the channel, towards San Juan Island, and then headed north. As they made their way up the shoreline, the whale watch vessel Imagine reported that
T60D and T60E
were making their way south, close in to the San Juan shoreline, however the team never acquired these whales before the blew past the
T18s
and towards Friday Harbor." [See CWR Encounter #54 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-54 for full summary and photos]
