19:30 -
Last evening (8/9) at about
7:30 pm, I saw two orcas from the
Hood Canal Bridge
. I was driving east across the bridge and saw the dorsal fin of what I thought was a female. The fin went under the water briefly and then resurfaced briefly. I then saw the dorsal fin and back of what I thought was a juvenile. The whales were swimming west on the south side of the bridge. A passenger in the car saw the whales surface again when they were behind the car. She saw two that looked to be females and the juvenile - three whales in all. I have seen orcas a few times. Based on the size and shape of the dorsal fin I am sure these were orcas and not porpoises. -Randy Robinson, Seattle, WA

We spent time with
2 humpback whales
on the PSE afternoon tour near
Lopez Island

Ocular [BCY0177's calf 2016]
