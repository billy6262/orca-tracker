20:26-

20:31 - 3-4 orcas
in a tight group, including one large male southbound 1/2 mile south of
Landbank
about 300 - 400' from shore. It was thrilling to see them so close to shore and hear their exhalations. They traveled quickly, with one small interaction between two of them and a nice surprise spyhop. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

They were
southbound
, just passed around

Entry 3:
5 Probable Biggs (Transient) Orcas. - Sheringham Point Lighthouse, BC
(Vancouver Island, Sooke District). Fast moving into the shallow waters at the base of the lighthouse, spotted a Pacific Harbour Porpoise racing through the area, possible predation. Slow moving and circling at the base of the lighthouse, under free floating bull kelp. They left that area in about 4 minutes, heading south, southeast towards the south end of Vancouver Island, along the coast to the access to
Sooke Harbour
. -Dave Boyce, Nanaimo, BC

Bush Point near midnight
on 8/11 that David Bain flagged as "

Mid channel. Around 630 PM. Viewing from

18:18 - [orcas]
Headed north to the [
Hood Canal
] bridge. -Mary's Sunshine Farm
*

18:02 -
They are closer to Shine now, so moving NE.

17:59 -
I would say that they are just NE of the buoy. They somewhat seem to be moving north. (I've been calling it a buoy but it is really a beacon. I'm right by #7 flashing green, so I imagine that I am looking at #6 flashing red, but I don't have a chart to check.)

17:51 -
It seems like they are pretty close to the buoy in
Squamish Harbor
.

17:43 - [orcas]
I saw two across the way and now one right in front of our house. We are just north of Lofall/Four Corners. -Alan Robertson

Headed north just south of
Bridgehaven
on west shoreline.
5:15pm. -David Mellon

17:09 - [orcas]
They're just south of
Bridgehaven
now. West side of canal. -Sea Kelly Ro
*

18:42 - Just heard from someone at Hicks Beach that more are heading to the bridge now. So they did split. Some went into the bay and the others passed the bridge. Will confirm in a few minutes.
6:42 pm.

18:30 -
We are trying to figure out what just happened. We think they split. Definitely saw one go under and north of the bridge. Trying to figure out if the others are ahead or behind at this point.

18:05 -
They are west channel. Straight out from
Squamish Bay
. 605. Can't tell if they are heading into the bay or north yet.

16:56 -
They are directly out from me now. Definitely mid to further east side now.

16:22 -
They are definitely moving towards the middle now.
