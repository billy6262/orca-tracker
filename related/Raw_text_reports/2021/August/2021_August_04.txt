T65A2
slipped past
Seawall Park, Langley
, on his way to explore the dock pilings at Sandy Point, creating screams of excitement from a group of youngsters as his sprouting dorsal fin curved like a scythe toward the beach where they were standing. Just as quickly he disappeared from view, setting off a stampede from the whale watchers hoping to catch another glimpse of this impressive whale as he rounded the point.

----Weds
August 4th - whales all around! The T65As are our 'regular' Bigg's whales these days, and an extra treat when they're in Penn Cove! A lot of seals haul out on the mussel rafts so it's a good place to hunt. They made close passes to the Coupeville wharf and Long Point, before heading south in Saratoga Passage. Later in the day a group of T's headed north in Admiralty Inlet, fairly close to Whidbey also. I LOVE days like this. Photos zoomed and cropped. photo - "Hunting by the mussel rafts, very close to shore. This is
T65A3
Amira, he made several close passes like this." photo - "

. This mussel raft was right in front of me (I was standing on the bluff)." -Jill Hein
