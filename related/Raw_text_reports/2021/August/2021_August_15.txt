Saw a pod today while sitting on beach next to marina in downtown Pt. Townsend. About 1pm. Swimming westerly in passage
between Pt. Townsend and Fort Flagler
towards Fort Worden and Point Wilson Lighthouse. Six whales, two with very large dorsal fins. Have video if that helps at all. First time in 34 years living in Washington and spending countless time on Puget Sound beaches that we've seen them live. Spectacular! -Sharon Gill Rogers
