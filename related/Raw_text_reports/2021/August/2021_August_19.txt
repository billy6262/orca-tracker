UNCONFIRMED DOLPHIN - Thu, Aug 19 - North Puget Sound - I saw something today that was a bit bigger than a porpoise but lighter in color and moving much more
like a dolphin
. It definitely was not a porpoise and it did not look like the bottlenose. I tried to get a video but didn't get my phone out in time. It was off
Jefferson Head moving south
. Any ideas? -Sara Frey

Per David Anderson at Cascadia Research Collective, they have had a couple recent unconfirmed reports of what could be dolphins. "Common dolphins have come in from the ocean every year since 2010, usually in the summer, so I don't doubt that it is happening again. Three times, groups have stayed in the South Sound for a year or more, with the most notable being the group that was here from 2016 through last year. I really hope someone gets pictures so we can confirm it."
