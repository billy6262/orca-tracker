With early reports from fishing friends of Orca passing Sooke at 8 am we were excited to get out and see who was hunting around our waters...We caught up with Biggs/Transient Killer Whales
(T018's & T019B and T019C) near Race Rocks Lighthouse

8/26....lovely misty gray day out at
Race Rocks
with Aerie the
humpback (MMY0106) and the T18/19's
....big boy
T19B Galiano (born 1995), matriarch T18 Esperanza (est. born 1955), her daughter (Galiano's mom) T19 Nootka (b. 1965), and her second son, T19C Sprouter (b. 2001).
They were cruising around Bentinck Island by Race Rocks. Esperanza suddenly went for a kill, with Galiano zooming over to join her. She got a harbor porpoise (I missed those pictures!) -Bonnie Gretz
