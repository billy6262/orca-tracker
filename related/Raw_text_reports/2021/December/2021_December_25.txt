Entry 2:
Saratoga Passage -
(
Reported as orcas, follow-up determined was the
gray whale
- alb
) - Follow-up: Thanks for sending me that clip. My husband & I did see
a gray whale
on Christmas day. So cool! My husband & I moved to Greenbank (from Ohio) over four years ago. Not too many whales in Ohio. I didn't expect to see a whale (gray or orcas) this late in the year. What an unexpected delight! Original Report: My husband & I just witnessed a pod of orcas hunting in the Saratoga Passage off of
Hidden Beach
(Greenbank) from our house. Started @
12:20 pm or so. First saw spray of several different individual orcas. A dark dorsal fin broke the surface of water multiple times as pod moved northward. The water roiled up in a circular pattern. The surface seemed to bubble up, settle & then repeat. Just guessing that this is some kind of hunting behavior? We watched this behavior for 20-25 minutes. Then pod seems to have continued northward. Didn't expect to witness a display like this today. -Kathy Daberko
