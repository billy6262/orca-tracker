Seeing spread out at least three orcas, incl male, off

Saltwater Park east side did channel northbound quickly. I believe they would be in audible range of southbound Js and are not back off or changing course so wondering if we have other residents? Too far for IDs. Added: This sighting was at least 3.

porpoising northbound
