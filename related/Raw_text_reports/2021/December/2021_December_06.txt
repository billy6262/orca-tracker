Orca Sightings for December 6, 2021
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hood Canal (T68Cs)
- Today was a spectacular day along the Hood Canal. We ventured over to highway 106 to see if we could find some eagles and maybe even the transient orcas who happened to be hanging out in the canal looking for grub. We saw about a dozen eagles which gave us an opportunity to capture some photos. On our way back from Hunter Farms, I checked the Orca Network site [FB page] to see if there had been and sighting of the orcas. They were last seen heading east around mile marker #9. Just as we arrived at
mile marker #10 on highway 106
, we saw a few cars parked and thought maybe the orcas were nearby. It had been a couple hours since the post at
10:30. We got out watched and waited. We spotted dorsal fins coming in our direction. Shortly thereafter 3 orcas surfaced right in front of us about 30 yards away. We began clicking away, hoping to get a few good shots. Here are a few of the photos I was able to capture. -Edith Hitchings
