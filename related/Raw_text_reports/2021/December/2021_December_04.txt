10:25 - [orcas]
Found them this morning directly out from
Seabeck
. Watched them hunt multiple times. I'm trying to confirm number of hunts by photos and videos, but I believe we ended up at 6. Lots of surface action with breaching, cartwheels, tail slaps. Their hunts were VERY close to the other shoreline west side of the Hood Canal.
Number in family we saw was 4
. We lost track of them as they turned into Dabob Bay at noon, hugging the northern shoulder. -Tisa Annette
