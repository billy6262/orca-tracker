Center for Whale Research Encounter #94: "The morning info placed the whales just meters off the beach
along the Victoria waterfront
, and after initially spotting only a single bull, they were thinking "Bigg's." Several more suddenly appeared, and with the large spread and erratic swimming patterns, they realized they had stumbled into
Southern Residents

Entry 2:
North Puget Sound (T68Cs +) -

Just a bit north of Water Street in
Edmonds
, pretty far out but it's so calm you can see them. ---- Went to Sunset Avenue to look for the orcas that were heading towards Edmonds, saw them to the north so I went over to Water Street and found them! Pretty far out but it was so calm you could still see them. Pretty awful pics but still happy I saw some whales off of Edmonds! The double tail fluke was cool! [
follow-up w/Janine: she first saw the pod coming south, at some point they flipped and were heading back north -alb

ID Edit from Justine: I was mistaken in my initial ID. I didn't get good enough photos this time to be positive, but I now believe these were the
T68Cs
, likely with the T68Bs or another family. No big bull so it's likely T68 and T68A weren't there this time. I estimate between 8-10 in the group so it's definitely possible just the T68B1s joined the T68Cs. I know for sure there were 2 calves and at least 2 adult females in the group, especially on the 27th.

They have continued south. They are very close to the Mukilteo side, approaching the ferry terminal from the north.

11:08 -
Seeing them from
Clinton
. Viewing conditions are actually really tough because the water is producing steam from the extreme temperature differences. As they get closer, I can provide more updates. -Danielle Pennington

Judy and Tom Knowak called to report seeing
at least 5 orcas in Possession Sound
with nice sunlight on the group. Transients came from Port Susan, Judy spotted them first from their place - watching them for ~30 minutes from
Point Mission, Tulalip Reservation
. Pod is ~2km away from them, now milling in the middle of Port Gardner Bay, Everett, and appear to be feeding on some unfortunate seal or sea lion. Some tail thrashing and large number of gulls swooping in to feed on scraps.
