We saw the
T068Cs
as they cruised out of
Elliot Bay
yesterday (12/29/21). They hunted a harbor seal, and continued moving south as they delighted folks near

Video from my iPhone not zoomed, just off
Lowman Beach Park

They were milling mid channel then we saw them toss a large seal or sea lion and they started chasing it towards us! We saw the seal/sea lion about 10 ft away from us so guessing it got away. Then they took off S bound again. Looks like Saratoga was just floating and the Orcas swam towards it. -Kristen Alvarez
