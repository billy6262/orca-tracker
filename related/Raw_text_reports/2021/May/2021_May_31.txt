Center for Whale Research Encounter #31: "… Hanna was onshore in Oak Bay and, in the still air, actually heard the animals before she saw them, roughly the same time that Mark and Joe slowed at the cardinal buoy at the east entrance to Enterprise Channel. She dialed the Mike 1 crew in, and they began the encounter at 0759 at 48° 24.7 N / 123° 17.3 W as the whales surfaced roughly 800 metres off the bow, moving out of
Baynes Channel
toward Brodie Rock. Even at a distance, T046B2's distinct notch gave the crew a clue as to the matriline, and on the next breathing cycle, the
T046Bs
were confirmed, still traveling southwest. The dispersed
T046B1s were not present
, making a total of five Bigg's killer whales. …" [See CWR Encounter #31 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-31 for full summary and photos]
