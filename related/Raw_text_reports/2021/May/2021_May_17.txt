Victoria McKay called again with update. She now sees group heading directionally south, definitely not close to Whidbey side, seem far. Watched them pass through ferry lanes [maybe sightline]. She has now seen the male who was w/female. All making their way
south
, moving quickly.

11:51 -
Victoria Mckay called. She's at
Ebey's Landing
and sees the orcas straight out, no longer on Whidbey side, look to be more on other side of channel. She has not seen the male yet. Looks like group might be hunting, not traveling at a pace, they've been at same spot past 5-10 minutes. First saw them around the Buoy earlier. And just now while on the phone one female just surfaced. Still look to be hunting; they are non-directional at this time.

(west of Coupeville) 5/17/2021 at approximately
