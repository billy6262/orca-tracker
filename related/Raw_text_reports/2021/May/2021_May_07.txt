----… We caught up with them outside of Langley and right away we were able to identify them as CRC531 and CRC21 thanks to 531 sounding her flukes and 21's very yellow rostrum. We got a lot of great flukes and close surface behavior from these two whales and had another whale southbound along Camano island. After 531 and 21 continued north we swung over to check out the southbound whale who turned out to be 44 Dubknuck. He was showing his flukes like crazy... He soon made the turn north to join 531 and 21 so we began to make our way south. …

10:45 - 2261 and 2 other gray whales in the Snohomish river delta.
---We began to scour Port Gardner as we made our way
between the Snohomish River Delta and the Hat Island
feeding grounds. It didn't take long for Captain Carl to find our first group of whales feeding just off the delta. We were quickly able to ID gray whale 2261 due to its round scar on its dorsal ridge and traveling with them was gray whale 185. As we watched these two massive animals, Brittany found two more whales out near Camano Island, and one way in toward the beaches near Tulalip. After some great looks at 2261 and 185, we branched to find the two that we had seen heading toward Saratoga pass. -Tyson Parker Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching
