Spotted them at last light from Victor. After 9PM on 5/20/21. Milling
between Rocky Bay and Treasure Island
. ----A few last light photos from last night. Taken 5/20/21 after 9pm. Was watching them with binoculars from Herron Island Ferry dock I decided to take a gamble on changing spots and hope I'd be able to find them again. It paid off! Photos taken from Victor. They were spread out and milling towards Rocky Bay. Lots of tail slaps. So quiet you could hear them all breathing. Seems they're liking

14:18 -
Looks like the
Johnson Point
group went around the tip and started heading south on the west side of the point. They are too close to
Harstine Island
for me to see with my binoculars. There was a boat that kept driving through the middle of them...

14:03 -
They are still just hanging out off the northern tip of
Johnson Point
. Circling a small fishing boat. Just going back and forth. At least 2, maybe 3.

13:35 -
I just saw one or 2 pop up
north of Johnson Point
! Looks like it/they were heading north. ETA- definitely a big bull and he's doing some tail slapping. Kind of trending north but mostly hanging out off the tip of Johnson Point.

11:10 -
They've moved south into the
Nisqually Reach
, far enough that I can't see them anymore.

10:47 -
They are just off the north tip of Johnson Point. Heading south into the
Nisqually Reach
. Very slow, long down times, no splashing or jumping.

10:38 -
Big huge bull and 3 more orca moving
slowly south out of Case Inlet
. Don't know if this is a second group or if the other group turned around and came back. Right now, they are in the middle
between Johnson Point, Taylor Bay, and Harstine Island
.

10:00 -
Just saw them book out of
Case Inlet
, heading south quickly close to Harstine Island. I lost them when I started alerting the neighbors so I don't know if they headed toward Nisqually or if they went on the west side of Johnson Point. They were moving quick. -T.j. Smith

~

10:00 -
Thought I'd take my chances w/o reports to point me in the right direction.. went to
Joemma State Park
and as soon as I got out on the dock & raised my binoculars, the 1st thing I saw was the bull's dorsal right off Camp Coleman/Whiteman Cove. They were on a kill & I observed them surfacing with quick dives, drifting from mid channel right up close to shore. It was so close, but so far away from me!! They turned and headed towards Nisqually. -Melissa Bird
