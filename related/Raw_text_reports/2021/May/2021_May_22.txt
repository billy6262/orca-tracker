Center for Whale Research Encounter #28: … "Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and, after tip-toeing around a wedding getting ready to get started right near the dock, left in the boat at 1430. "Orcinus" arrived on scene around 1500 immediately after coming out of Johns Pass where a small group of Ts were heading west off the north side of Johns Island. The situation was "busy" and it was another fifteen minutes before Dave could get close enough to get the first photos. The whales zigged offshore a little and then on the next series they zagged back toward the Stuart Island shoreline. It took longer than normal but the whales finally showed themselves to be the
T75Bs. T75B
has a
new calf of the year, T75B4. The T65As plus T77 and T77E
were also reported to be heading up President Channel. The T75Bs headed west near the Stuart Island shoreline until they started milling around 1550 about a quarter mile east of Turn Point. …" [See CWR Encounter #28 for photos and full summary] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2021-28

We were at
SW Spieden
last Saturday [5/22/21] when a pod surfaced 20' behind our boat as we were retrieving a shrimp pot. We turned the motors off immediately. An orca pulled on our shrimp pot towing the boat for approximately 10 seconds. Our commercial pot puller started shuddering, grinding and then started stripping out. Our line went from vertical to 30° and not due to being stuck on the bottom or due to currents. The pot was approximately halfway up when it started towing us. We were thinking curiosity, shrimp scent or playfulness? -Theresa B. Murry

COASTAL ORCAS - Sat,

Entry 6:
18:15 -
My wife and I watched
3 Orcas
kill something (guessing a seal) about ½ mile off shore of
Cape Kiwanda
, almost directly in front of Haystack Rock. This took place Saturday,
May 22 at
6:15 PM. They stayed in the same spot for about 35 minutes, presumably eating their kill and celebrating. We saw several breaches and some spy hops. Dozens of birds were attracted to the kill and were swooping in for scraps. Finally, they swam north to the Cape and spent about 10 minutes in shallow waters between the gap formed by the cape. A dory boat went close to them, then they moved around the cape to our north, out of view. It was a thrill to watch this take place so close to shore. -Pete Stoll
