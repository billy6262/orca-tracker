15:35 -
Stephanie Riles [sp?] called to report a
gray whale
. They are observing a gray whale closer to mid channel, about in the
Clinton/Mukilteo lanes
, closer to Mukilteo side heading northbound. Whale is aimed directly towards Hat Island. Travel is medium pace.
*
After receiving early morning reports of whales near
Hat Island
, we head that direction and soon found
gray whale 185
as he was swimming in the shallows just south east of Hat. We hung out with him for some time as another gray whale was coming in from Whidbey Island. As 185 headed toward the Snohomish River Delta, we were able to join up with the other whale. It turned out to be
2356
, a rather new gray whale to the area and it gave us some great views. Our searched expanded north from there to the southern ends of Port Susan and Saratoga Passage, but after coming up empty, we head back down Hat Island. As we approached the Hat Island marker, we found an Osprey perched on it and swooped in for a closer look. While checking out the Osprey, Casey found us one of our whales and so we headed over to see who it was. We were soon on scene with 2356 again as it was headed north. We waved goodbye after some time and cruised over to the delta with 185. By now the fog was gone and just a bitter memory and the sun was out all around. It was a marvelous day to be on the water and seeing these two magnificent beasts was spectacular! -Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Everett)
