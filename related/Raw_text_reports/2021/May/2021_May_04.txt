Thought you might find it interesting that I just saw
two gray whales just swim east to Point Fosdick
and turned north heading for the Narrows. Time spotted was 1 hour ago. Less than 100 meters from shore. -Michael Parkour

Yesterday morning [5/4/21], at around
8:30, there was a second-hand report of a whale in
Budd Inlet
heading south - passing
Boston Harbor
. I looked all day and saw nothing. I relayed report to Jessie as well. I just saw the report of a gray whale in the
Narrows
. So, I'm curious if in fact there was a whale this far south. Seems to be a lot of territory to cover though. -Kim Merriman

Entry 5:
13:50 &

15:00 - A solo gray in Saratoga Passage headed south toward Pebble Beach from about a mile south of Mabana
. About 50 yds off Camano shore. Smaller blow than others and not coming out of the water much. Steady slow pace south. This is the 2nd gray I've seen today and the other had quite a bigger blow and larger body. Picture from earlier whale at
1:50 that was headed south as well. -Jennifer Feldman Spanton

two groups of orcas heading south along Texada
. These two groups were first spotted about 1/4 of the way down Texada Island (heading south from the north tip of Texada). They were also very far away, but it did appear there were 3-4 orcas in the first group and little ways behind them there were another 3-4 orcas.
