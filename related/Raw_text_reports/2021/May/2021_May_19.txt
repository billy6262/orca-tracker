12:30 -
I'm sending you what I have of the
Humpbacks which were in Case Inlet
last week. These were taken at around
12:30pm on 5/19/21 when they were milling (presumably feeding)
north of McMicken Island
. I used a 1200mm equivalent lens from about 1.5 miles away, so the distance and atmospheric distortion that day didn't allow for crisp detailed photos. But maybe a couple of them are useful for ID purposes. These were taken from the shore of Harstine Island, south of McMickent Island, looking north toward Stretch Island. The HBs were about midway between Harstine and the north end of Herron Island. -Dave Berliner

humpbacks

GRAY WHALES - Wed,

Entry 5:
San Juan Islands -
We headed south out of Friday Harbor and had an encounter with
gray whale CRC1364 who came north through Cattle Pass
. We met the whale near Kings Pt. and paralleled the whale until it reached Big Rock. It was surfacing about every 3 minutes and showing its tail flukes on most dives. We decided to break off to continue down to Goose Island, Whale Rocks and Deadman Island. We're noticing many small Steller sea lions including some pups at Whale Rocks. A bald eagle stood on the rocks nearby disturbing the gulls by his presence. As we continued back north, we got word that the gray whale flipped back south after reaching Fisherman's Harbor. We had another quick look before sailing back to port by way of Turn Island where harbor seals were hauled out on the rocks and a family of raccoons foraged along the tide line. (added: We're thinking CRC1364 is looking better). -Captains David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

…We poked into McCardle Bay to check out an eagle's nest and then made our way over to Swirl Rocks where we found a Canada goose. We headed west from there along the shores, weaving in and out of dozens of shrimpers before we joined up with
gray whale CRC 1364 on Salmon Bank
. The whale was very cooperative and showed us its tail flukes multiple times as it headed toward Cattle Pass. …Tyson Reed, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

Entry 7:
16:07 -
Just spotted one
gray off of Spee-Bi-Dah beach in Port Susan
. Too far away to see any identifiers. Heading north towards Kayak/Warm Beach direction. Seemed like it was just traveling and not actively feeding. We get a lot of feeding out front of our place, and I would have recognized if it was feeding. -Joe Eichinger
