… T-party! Highlights of this encounter included a sudden unexpected aerial leap by

are here. T123s are not part of the T-party. 17 individuals in the T-party and 4 individuals from T123s. -Yifan Ling

GRAY WHALES - Sat,
May 8 - San Juan Islands - … We left the [orca] pod to continue their southbound trek and circled Cypress to visit with
gray whale CRC-1364 who was in Deepwater Bay, Cypress Is
. With repeated soundings, it was easy enough to reach an ID using the fluke photos, but we hardly need it with this whale given how much time it has spent near Fidalgo of late. Get one look at the dorsal ridge and we could tell you who it is. -Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)

Sat,

Entry 2:
Port Susan -

15:00 - Multiple gray whales
feeding a mile off Kayak Point at 1500. Two I was able to ID were 21 and 44. It was a feeding frenzy!!! --- …we headed north to Port Susan. Upon reaching the shallow waters in the north end of [Port] Susan, we found a massive feeding frenzy of gray whales. Everywhere we looked whales were digging into the bottom and feeding like crazy. The waters surged all around us as we watched the shrimp buffet. It was absolute pandemonium, and we were even able to get a couple of ID's. Two of the whales feeding closest to us turned out to be
44 Dubknuck and 21 Shackleton
