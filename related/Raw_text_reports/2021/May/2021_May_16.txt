… By the time we made it to the Strait of Juan de Fuca the fog had mostly cleared and whales were starting to be found! We visited with
two humpback whales near Eastern Bank
, getting several looks at their beautiful flukes and towering spouts. Despite clear photos, we were not able to confirm IDs so further digging will be needed. Near
McArthur Bank
we visited with a
third humpback, none-other-than Split Fluke, Big Mama's 2006 calf
! We were so excited to see this Salish Sea baby back for the season. …Sam Murphy, Island Adventures Whale Watching (Anacortes)
