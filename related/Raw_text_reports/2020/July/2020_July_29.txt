============================================================

Entry 1:
Howe Sound - ~

20:30 -
Saw a pod of
at least 3 killer whales in between McNabb Creek and the Little Defence Islands
on the North side of Howe Sound at approximately
8:30pm tonight. Pod was headed North East towards Furry Creek / Porteau Cove. Squamish, BC. -Mike Koronko

GRAY WHALES - Wed,

Entry 2:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

20:00 -
I was gazing out at the water this evening and thinking it was about that time when 2356 might be coming by for his daily very-late-happy-hour snack-time, and sure enough, there it was, coming toward us from near the entrance to the marina at Mariners' Cove (just a tad north of me). Yay!
Gray2356
swam in from the north, and was in an awful hurry to get to the buffet tonight. It wasn't feeding at all as it approached - just cruising southbound at a very brisk clip, but then it screeched to a halt right in front of our place (yay!). This was right about 8pm. It hung out in one spot for several minutes, pretty darn close to shore (see video), changed direction a couple of times as it was feeding, and then very slowly worked its way south toward Polnell. It took about 25 minutes to go from my place down to the rocks that stick way out in the water (submerged at high tide), so it was definitely taking its time. Lots of pretty calm feeding as it swam into the sunset. It was really beautiful out there tonight, and a whale spout in the distance made it even more magical. -Marianne Parry

11:30 -
Our new regular visitor Gray 2356 made a lunchtime appearance today! It appears to have come
north from Polnell
- my husband saw some boats drifting and watching something in that direction at
10:50am but it was too far around the bend for us to see. However, by
11:30am it appeared, and was slowly feeding northward. In front of our place (southern tip of Mariners' Cove), it did a loop (couple of u-turns) and I thought maybe it was going back southward, but then it popped up again in the northbound direction and continued on. Once it decided to head north again, it did not appear to feed, but just swam straight-ish, spouting periodically. -Marianne Parry
