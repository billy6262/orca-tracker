We got to watch them for close to an hour. They stayed a ways off Deadman's Island [
Cutts Island State Park
]. They definitely were hunting. Lots of swimming around, tail slapping. Absolutely incredible to see. Boats around us were respectful, cut engines and just sat while they swam around. -Erin Barnes
*

21:33 -
They are now out of my sight which probably means they are heading into
Henderson Bay
.

21:15 -
I just saw them west of
Raft Island
at
9:15. They are not moving fast at all. Hope that means they are finding some good food!

21:03 - [orcas]

There was a small pod of orcas in the lower part of
Henderson Bay
this evening from at least
19:30 until
21:15. I saw at least six, including two males, but I believe that there may have been some that were behind some trees from my view. There was a large crowd of boats and jet skis near them. They spent over an hour in about the middle of the bay off of Cutts Island. At about
20:45, some of them moved further up the bay to right off of my house, about ¼ mile below Minter Creek and then turned around. They did a lot of tail slapping (especially as they were leaving) and some tail lobbing, fin slapping, and spy hopping. Yesterday or Sunday I saw a big group of harbor seals feeding in the bay, so there's lots of food around for the orcas. -Tim Hoffnagle
*

We got lucky again sitting on our deck on a gorgeous sunny day today looking at the water and saw a huge dorsal fin with boats slowing around. Grabbed my binos & my husband Richard got his camera as the Orca couple & baby swam by! Looks like they were having a leisurely swim with a little spouting as they headed
towards Tacoma Narrows Bridge

GRAY WHALES - Tue,

Entry 8:
Northern Saratoga Passage -
18:00 &

20:30 -
This was a three-sighting day! Way cool. In addition to this morning's report, I also saw
gray 2356 around 6pm cruising by Mariners' Cove
southbound (I don't think it was feeding), but it veered out into the channel as it moved south. Then, around
8:30pm (7/14/2020), it came by southbound again, quite close to shore and feeding heavily. It's working its way toward Polnell now, but going very slowly. Sure is fun to see that big ol' pectoral fin waving at us. I can confirm that I saw the white line, so it was 2356. -Marianne Parry
*

09:10 -
As predicted (i.e. hoped for), I spotted some spouts pretty far out in the channel just south of Mariners Cove, and it appeared to be moving northwest and closer to my area. However, I lost track of it behind some trees and haven't picked up any trace since then. My guess is that
2356 was heading for the Polnell
breakfast buffet, but I can't confirm. Hopefully someone down there will get a better look, and maybe I'll get lucky and it will cruise by here afterwards. It's
9:10am now and I hear the occasional puff so pretty sure it's still just south of me at Polnell. Have a wonderful day! -Marianne Parry
*
MINKE WHALES - Tue,

Entry 9:
Salmon Bank where we met two minkes with a third nearby.
Tricky spotting as they weren't feeding amongst birds but we had great views as we drifted. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
