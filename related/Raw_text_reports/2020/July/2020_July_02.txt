Thu,

Entry 2:
San Juan Islands (T37As & T49As) -
We left Friday Harbor with our passengers post-haste knowing that two families of Biggs/Transient orcas known as the T37A's and T49A's had come through Obstruction Pass heading inter-island. As we came through Wasp Passage we heard that they'd split. The T49A's turned back in
Harney Channel and came down Upright Channel
and the T37A's were exploring Massacre Bay at the top of West Sound on Orcas Island. We met the T37A's as they were hunting in a cove just south of the bay. It was a successful hunt - T37A1 surfaced alongside T37A4 with seal intestines wrapped around his/her dorsal fin. After their meal they headed south and stopped
north of Bell Island
to hunt again. We saw the youngest calf
T37A5
playing with its food throwing it around at the surface. The family did some milling outside of Pole Pass as they shared their dinner and socialized for a bit before continuing west in Wasp Passage. After rounding Crane Island the group went northeast towards Deer Harbor and we went west out through Nob Island Pass with a nice sail across the channel towards San Juan Island. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*

16:34 - At least 5 orcas just moved through Harney Channel heading west
, accompanied by boats. Even the ferry goers got a good look! My shots are with a cell phone, very blown up, so not good quality, seen from shore. -Mariann Carrasco

...4 boats trailing. Heading toward Shaw. -Ryan Oakes
*
We continued home and just when we were about to wrap things up, Captain Tyler got a call from a friend who saw more
orcas right near Anacortes
! We decided to investigate since they were right there in our backyard and sure enough, we found two more families of Bigg's orcas, the T37A's, and the T49A's. They were breaching and tail-slapping up a storm - a perfect grand finale to our day! -Erin Gless, Island Adventures

At least 3 Orca on the East side of Holmes Harbor heading North!--- A few pictures from last night in

19:51 - orca
sighting...there were just
2 orcas in Holmes Harbor
towards the boat builders/the end of the harbor just about 10 minutes ago. -Chelsea Willis
*

19:40 -
Still in
Holmes Harbor
but turned north, milling around. Too far away to get good pictures from land, but close enough to enjoy! added info: For a while they were in the middle about as far south as the golf course. They turned north after a while and I lost sight of them when they were still
south of Baby Island
closer to the east side of the harbor. There were a lot of boats around. Most were behaving and got a good show. We were on a high bank and think we saw 3 of various sizes but couldn't see closely enough to give specific descriptions. -Cindi Bowen

one orca headed north out of Holmes Harbor
at

Jack Burchard called to update that the Penn Cove group at
tip of Penn Cove
went straight across, sightline in front of Oak Harbor, then turned right towards Saratoga Passage. He could see
at least 3-4
.
*
After the fog lifted it was good to see - in
Penn Cove - Bigg's whales, the T36s
traveled west
past Coupeville wharf
, then turned back east. They appeared to be heading south down Saratoga Passage when I came home. Very distant photos and heavily cropped, but still very privileged to see them. -Jill Hein
*

12:36 - [orcas] In Penn Cove, just west of the Coupeville Dock.
-Deb Barge
*
Lucky day,
orcas in Penn Cove
! …First saw them in the fog and mist from Long Point just outside Penn Cove, then followed them
(T36s)
into the cove, with a few whale watch boats. They came in just
past the Coupeville Wharf
, then turned and headed out. Some activity, looked like lunch. Wonderful to see them, as well as human friends! Mid-cove, so quite distant...pics heavily cropped. -Bonnie Gretz
*

13:29 -
Correction. Still just
inside Penn Cove
entrance but heading east.

13:23 - Leaving Penn Cove
eastbound mid channel.

12:22 - [orcas] Headed into Penn Cove
north side, westbound. -Marilyn Armbruster
*
…we continued along the Whidbey Island coast where we spotted not one, but
two types of whale - Bigg's, or mammal-eating orcas, and a gray whale
at the same time! While gray whales can sometimes be on the menu for killer whales, fortunately these whales were contentedly traveling south while the gray whale headed north. We decided to view the orcas first. It was a family of 5, identified as the
T36B's
. They seemed to be enjoying a leisurely afternoon and after spending some quality time with this family, we left them as they
headed into Penn Cove
. -Erin Gless, Island Adventures
*
update: Was not the T65As, but
others present with T36s
.

12:00 -
They just met up with the T65As and they're heading
toward Penn Cove
!

11:54 -
We have a
gray slowly northbound from Pollnel Point
and the
T36s
have now turned southbound out from Crescent Harbor.
---7/2/2020 on Saratoga in Saratoga Passage! The day started out rainy and gray with a
Gray Whale at Polnell Point
. We also encountered the
T36s in Penn Cove
and were in for a surprise when they chased a Harbor Seal right under the boat! The seal did not find shelter there, however, and the orcas had lunch near Coupeville shortly after! photo:

10:30 - An orca just cruised northbound past Eagle Crest in the Saratoga Passage
in the fog between the crabbing boats; at 10-
10:30am
July 2, heading for Madrona. I just saw one. But it's fogged in pretty thick this morning. (maybe northeast towards Penn Cove and Oak Harbor last I saw around
10:30am). -Kristina Trowbridge
*

9:30 Camano side, Saratoga passage
, we saw 3 right off
Indian Beach
, very close in! Doing some milling, spyhopping, tail splashing, then turned northbound to meet another group that was more mid channel (at least two in the 2nd group, maybe three) then they all continued north. What a way to start the morning! -Joan Smith

We decided to look for the
gray whale
on the way home, and it was actually a keen-eyed passenger that spotted the spout! Gray whales typically leave the area in May or June, but sometimes linger due to the area's abundance of ghost shrimp. This whale did not appear to be one of our usual "Sounder" gray whales, so was submitted to researcher for further identification and identified as
a new whale to the area, CRC-2261
, who was first documented in this region in
May 2020. -Erin Gless, Island Adventures Whale Watching
*

18:15 - A gray
just zoomed by close to shore heading north past
Mariners Cove
,
6:15pm. I'm going to assume it was Newbie but can't confirm. Looked like a whale with a full tummy in a hurry to go take a nap. -Marianne Parry

15:00 -
My new BFF
2356
was feeding in front of our place for about half and hour (3-
3:30ish) just now. It is a funny one - it goes in circles/loops more than other whales I've seen here. I'll think it's heading away from me and then it will pull a U-y (sp?!) and mosey on back for a few more bites. It sure is easy to ID this one with that white line under the right blowhole. -Marianne Parry
