GRAY WHALES - Thu,

Entry 3:
10:40 - One gray heading north from Polnell
area. I saw it feeding just a bit as it came into view but then it hustled out toward the middle of the channel and is now parked way over off the northern top of
Utsalady
. I see spouts but too far to see details. Guessing 2356 but no proof. No photos or video to ID, but I saw a distinctive knuckle pattern through the binoculars as it arched to dive. This is from memory so not exact, but I think it had a large first knuckle, a couple of regulars, and then a valley where you'd expect another knuckle, a couple more regulars, and another valley, and then the last few knuckles toward the tail end. The large knuckle and the two valleys jumped out at me, but I honestly don't know what's typical for these guys so just reporting in case it helps ID. Thanks! -Marianne Parry
*

10:00 - Gray traveling East from Polnell Point to Mariners Cove.
--- As we walked our beach today, this Gray Whale passed through! We suspect it might be #2356. -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA
[
Yes, that is
2356

DOLPHINS - Thu,

Entry 4:
15:30 - [common dolphin] Between Anderson Island and the Key Peninsula. Drayton Passage
. First saw it as it was bow surfing at 25 mph. I immediately stopped. It played around us for 20 minutes. We thought it was gone till we started back up. Bill St. Jean
