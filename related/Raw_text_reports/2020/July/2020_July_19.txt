On the afternoon of
July 19 around 6 p.m. I was in my 19 ft. ski boat with my 2 sisters and one of my brothers-in-law. We were in
Carr Inlet
heading south from
Raft Island
when we spotted them heading north towards Purdy. There were 4 Orca; one being very large with its' dorsal fin having a slight limp. With the large Orca were 3 smaller Orcas. Staying a good distance from the whales we watched them head north for about 15 minutes. -Al Priidik, Resident of Lakebay, WA

15:00-

19:30 -
The same neighbor texted me that they were heading north past our houses (about 1.5 km south of
Minter Creek
) at
15:00. I didn't get the text until almost
17:00, when I noticed that there were a bunch of boats to the south of us. Through binoculars, I could see that the orcas were there and heading north. I went out in my kayak and followed them north nearly to Purdy (I kept hoping that they would go under the bridge!). They stayed in the northern part of the bay turning south, then north, then south...until I left them at
19:30. I met some neighbors in their kayaks near our houses at about
20:30. As we talked, we could see the boats getting closer and started to move north but then the orcas turned around and went back north and I left. -Tim Hoffnagle
*

16:06 -
Terry Shovlowsky called again to report the orcas are now heading back south away
from Purdy heading towards Cutts Island
slowly. Boats that followed stayed behind and slow. Some now ways away. Boating so much better than yesterday. Yesterday it was very congested. Many boats just out having fun, but in one instance a wave runner sped right up to them then stopped right on top of them.

15:00 -
Terry Shovlowsky lives on Henderson Bay on the KP side (between Purdy and Cutts on the other side). She has been watching for the orcas, has seen them the last few days. Saw reports they were leaving, but they are not. They are
heading towards Purdy
now. Not sure where Carr ends and Henderson begins, but pod has not come to the left of the island (Cutt's) from where I live. She reports there are boats out there and since we've seen so many abusive things happened over the past few days, but just 4 boats out there now. Lost sight of them in the time calling, they went under. She will keep an eye out. (Listened to them in the dark last night (18th) and could see them through binos. They were right under their house)

17:11 - Gray? Spouting at Polnell.
I had assumed our big gray friends had finally moved on, but I am dinghy-ing out to a sunny spot for a happy hour and saw three spouts just barely north of the end of the point at Polnell. It appeared to be heading toward shore but then completely vanished, so we'll have to float here alone except for the seals. Excited that a whale of some sort is still here! -Thanks!! Marianne Parry
