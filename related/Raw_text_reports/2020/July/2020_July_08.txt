Orca Sightings for July 8, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (T36 w/T36Bs, and T37As)
- We crossed Upright Channel before making our way over towards the orcas who stopped to hunt at the
bottom tip of Orcas Island
. As we arrived the orcas just finished eating and began traveling towards Obstruction Pass. Upon first looks we recognized the two family groups -
T36 with T36B's and the T37A's
. When we arrived in Rosario Strait the colors of the water almost looked tropical today with the lighting. It was a beautiful scene as we sailed along parallel to the orcas. Suddenly there were some direction changes and we think the orcas stumbled on some prey. They stopped to hang out for a bit followed by lots of surface activity. We saw many spy hops and breaches amongst the group. A couple double breaches, too. It was really exciting to watch their acrobatics.

-David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*
…we headed into an area we rarely get to during our expeditions known as
East Sound
. We joined up with the
T36B's and the T37A's
as they were heading out of the sound and got some amazing views. The lighting and backdrop of East sound we're stunning and the orcas we were with only made it better. As the orcas grouped up and pushed out of East Sound we decided to go explore and see what else we could find. … We took a nice cruise over to Cypress Island and Eagle Bluff to enjoy the scenery before calls came in that our morning orcas were headed out of Obstruction Pass so we headed back over to check them out one last time. It paid off as the orcas had shaken off the sleepier behavior and began to have some fun. We saw multiple spy hops and some breaches as the orcas just hung out swimming against a south bound current. -Tyson, Island Adventures Whale Watching

13:00 -
We spent a couple of hours watching
Bigg's Orcas in Eastsound and Obstruction Channel
today aboard the Island Explorer 5. I believe the naturalist onboard identified them as T36a and T37b groups. Here is a video I took of their play around 1300. -David Bieniek video: https://www.facebook.com/dlbieniek/videos/o.79401335600/10220696462653965/?type=2&theater

*

22:46 -
I'm hearing more whales. Starting at
8:30/
8:45 PM PST, I heard
echolocation clicks
that continued until
9:08/
9:10 PM when I heard 1 faint call. After that, I continued to hear more clicks, until about
9:12 when it went silent, only to resume at
9:15. At
9:17 I started hearing calls that seemed to be getting more frequent and might have been louder, but it was hard to tell thanks to the abundance of ship noise. I couldn't hear much after that, again due to ship noise, but at
9:45 PM PST, I realized that I could hear faint calls again through the ship noise.
At
9:53, the calls started getting louder
and a lot more frequent. The calls seemed to be S01 calls or something that sounded similar (I'm not 100% sure if I'm correct on the call, that's just what it sounded like to me). The vocalizations continued to get louder and continued to stay pretty frequent. At
10:14 PM, they seemed to be getting a quieter, and by

22:40 It went silent
and I couldn't hear any more calls.

17:49 -
Hello, you probably already know this, but I just wanted to say that I can hear
orcas over the LIme Kiln Hydrophones
. I'm hearing what sounds like (to me) S01 calls and echolocation clicks. I might be wrong about the exact call, but it's just what It sounded like to me. -Katie McDermott

16:16 -
I just identified what appears to be
some members of J Pod in Rosario
between Blakely Island and Cypress Island (
J37 & J49
). Two had been off east pointed at the Anacortes ferry terminal but quickly cut southwest to group up with several others--
J35, J44, J47, and J53
(to note: J46 was not traveling with the J17's, here). They turned northwest as if they might go up Thatcher Pass, but made a quick directional change and were
pointed south in Rosario
again, approaching James Island, as we left the scene at
16:27. -Amanda Marie Colbert, Orca Network

. We saw a group of
3-4 Orcas
in a loose pod come from directly north, now heading south west down hugging the coast of Stuart Island. An additional very large individual trailed them by a few minutes. He had a very large top fin. The others were smaller, maybe even included a juvenile. -Rebekah Skelly

BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Wed,

Entry 3:
Bellingham Bay (T36 w/T36Bs, and T37As) -

19:12 - A pod of approximately 7 orca whales
were sighted today, 7/8/20, at 1912 about 0.5 NM from Squalicum Harbor, 48-44.8N X 122-13.0W. They were traveling
from the Nooksack River Delta to the East 120 degrees True north
. (Additional info via call: Mike MacKay called to report seeing pod of ~7 orcas at
19:12 about 2 miles south of Squalicum Harbor. Pod was transiting the bay from west to east, coming from the delta area toward what they call Boulevard Park, on the east shore of Bellingham Bay. Not sure if Rs or Ts. They have a lot of seals hauling out on Portage Island. Also Spring Chinook salmon run in Nooksack River is doing very well.) -Mike MacKay

Wed,

Entry 5:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

15:15 - One gray
just went by at a pretty rapid clip, heading north past Mariners Cove, not feeding at all. He came by pretty close to shore but then did one of those big-arched-back dives and veered out to deeper water. Time for afternoon nap I suppose. I'm assuming it was 2356 but the white line is in the other side of its head when it's heading north so I can't confirm. -Marianne Parry
*

08:40 -
Good ol'
newb 2356
(confirmed the white mark below right nostril) is back for the breakfast buffet! It cruised by heading south around
8:40am (7/8/20). Appeared to feed a little bit on the way, but slowed down and started feeding more heavily just south of us (big shallow area), but still progressing slowly south toward Polnell Point. [From viewing video by Marianne: "Yep that is definitely 2356!" -Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective] -Marianne Parry
