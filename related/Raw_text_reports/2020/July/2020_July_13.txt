BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Mon,

Entry 2:
Penn Cove -

19:03 -
To the delight of those enjoying a sunset meal at Captain Whidbey, on Monday,
July 13th at
19:03 hours,
three orca dorsal fins
were spotted nearby! They appeared to be one adult and perhaps one to two juvenile orcas, no saddle patch could be made out in the quick appearance. However the breach was substantial, enough so the body and eye patch could be seen. Pod was headed west on the southwest shore of Penn Cove about 30 yards off the dock at Captain Whidbey. The pod then submerged and were not seen again until they were at the north side of the cove off the Penn Cove mussel dock. Photo attached was a bit too late and captured the tip of one last dorsal fin prior to heading under…Eric Cheong, Partner, Capt.
*
There was quite the orca show in
Penn Cove
last night [
July 13]! Looked like
a group of four with one big fella over towards Monroe Landing
. Would this be the same transient family? T46s? I seem to remember that fine dorsal fin from their last visit. Perhaps of note since their visit there have been two abandoned seal pups in Coupeville and a distinct surge in the number of seals hanging out nervously on this side… Meg Olson [
"Yes, turns out it was the
T46s
." -alb

Great bonus being on a training sail tonight with Schooner Suva...

Entry 3:
North Puget Sound/Port Susan -

13:10 -
I am very excited to have just sighted a group of orcas -
at least 5 confirmed
! One big male, and at least four females/juveniles. Travel behaviors only: 4 or 5 repeated breaths, then under water for quite a distance before surfacing again. At about
1:10 pm (07/13/2020) they were seen in the
Saratoga Passage
, moving northward at a good pace along the southern tip of Camano Island. As we watched they appeared to move Northwest, away from the shoreline of Camano and into the center of the channel, still headed north at a good pace. Long live the Orcas! -Susanna, Joe, and Sarah Trimarco

sound. One is very large one small and the other medium size. They were on the west side of Port Susan sound on the east side of Camano. When we saw them, they were just a tad bit north of us and we are almost at the tip of Camano. Maybe one mile up from the very tip. Have a great day. -Terri and Tom Smith

7/13/2020 A beautiful day toward the southern end of Puget Sound! We found the
T65As near Tacoma

GRAY WHALES - Mon,

Entry 10:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

17:30 - Mariners' Cove southbound
, feeding. A gray (2356?) took a wide swoop starting reasonably close to shore from Mariners' Cove outward and south (to avoid boats presumably) and ended up at its usual happy hour spot, just south of here toward Polnell Point. We saw huge plumes of whale puffs (pretty windy out there) in pretty much the same place for a good half hour before we lost sight of it around the bend, so my guess is that it was feeding. I cannot confirm that it was 2356, but it seems like a reasonable assumption since this seems to be its turf lately. Tune in again for "Breakfast with Spartacus" tomorrow hopefully. -Marianne Parry
*

09:35 - Newbie 2356
came over from across the bay this time (rather than from the north) for breakfast buffet and is currently just south of Mariners' Cove, feeding heavily, and slowly
heading toward Polnell
. Omg - that tail is magnificent when it waves it around to keep balance! (OK, it's only half of the tail showing, but still magical - lol!). No photos today, but I can confirm that I saw the white line below the blowhole so I know it's 2356. Neighbors have nicknamed it Spartacus. Have a great whale day!! -Marianne Parry
