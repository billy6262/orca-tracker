Entry 4:
San Juan Islands (T37As and T65As) -

20:24 -
Good morning, we saw 4 orcas in
Eastsound
last night. My friend who lives near Rosario texted me at
8:24 pm to let me know that
4-5 orcas
were headed north along the western side of Eastsound. I saw a boat stopped near the entrance to Cascade Bay where I spotted the fins from shore at Thistle Point. The orcas traveled to the east shore of Eastsound
near the salmon hatchery
then to Madrona Point where they hunted for 30-45 minutes. They then made their way south past Thistle Point on the west side of Eastsound around
9:50 pm. At that point it was getting dark and I lost sight of them. There were 2 fairly large whales and 2 smaller whales. There were very few white markings. Unfortunately I only had an iPhone with me and it was getting dark so I could not get any good pictures. -Gloria Eppig
*

17:25 - T37As in Cattle Pass -
looks like they're going to head up San Juan Channel.---Earlier in the day we had been following reports of two families of orcas known as the T37A's and the T65A's who had been hanging out on the east side of James Island for quite some time. Eventually the T37A's broke off and traveled down Rosario along the southern coastline of Lopez Island. We met the orcas at the picturesque Castle Rock where they appeared to stop to hunt for awhile. The flood current was moving very quickly between Colville Island and Castle Rock and the orcas moved back and forth between the islands as they were hunting. After a really fun encounter we decided to continue around Lopez where the strong current was in our favor to get a look at the other family of orcas who were now traveling down Rosario… -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

A neighbor sent me a text saying that the orcas were near the

at
16:00. I went out at
17:30 and kayaked all the way to Purdy without seeing them. On my way back, I ran into them heading toward the Spit. They continued to slowly move north for several hours before turning around about 300 m from the Spit at about
20:15. They then continued south, slowly and remained in the bay for quite a while - I heard them around

Entry 6:

They did at least 5 breaches near Miner's Bay. First time I have ever seen HB's breach in the Pass. Amazing! Photo taken from the shore of Galiano Island. Did you know that it takes about the same amount of energy for an adult male HB to breach as a 747 uses in take off? -Cheers, Karoline Cullen
