COASTAL ORCAS - Mon,

Entry 4:
Northern CA Coast -
A friend, Ross Taylor (fish biologist) was fishing for salmon off the mouth of the
Mad River
in 110' depth at 0730 (
July 27), texted at
0730
that a pod of
7-8 orcas including one big male passed him by going north
. Foggy. Ross Taylor's description, he left from Trinidad: "I was running south and noticed them to the inside of me, maybe couple 100 yards away. At first I wasn't sure what I was seeing. I then slowed down and moved in behind them. Yeah, I didn't try and run ahead of them or get alongside them, kind of trailed them for about 5 minutes and then they went down for a long time. Here are photos that I already cropped down. Maybe two males? There were more than 3 of them, seemed like at least 6 a few times when they all came up in unison." He saw them swimming north at 40.96N 124.182W. -Jeff Jacobsen

GRAY WHALES - Mon,

Entry 5:
17:30 -
Saw a
gray whale near the beach between Strawberry Point and Polnell Point
, maybe 3/4 of the way to Strawberry Point. It was rolling around off the beach in shallow water, I bet 10 feet or so. @
5:30 pm. -Will Sugg

17:15 -
We're watching a
gray
feeding its way toward us right now
17:15pm 7/27/20.---As I mentioned earlier, at
5:15pm-ish, I spotted a spout in the distance south of my place at
Mariners' Cove
and it appeared to be heading our way. It was indeed heading northward, but veeeery slowly, feeding constantly. It took quite a while to work its way up here, and since it was going the opposite direction than usual, it was going to be tough for me to ID it from the left side - it's amazing how this whale really prefers heading southbound through this feeding ground! It got right up to our place (southernmost tip of Mariners' Cove), and then decided to turn around and go back toward Polnell for more foodies. This was a stroke of luck for me, because I could easily ID 2356 on its right side - lol. It headed south for just a few minutes and then made a hard-left turn (before it got to the big rocks), headed out into the channel toward Camano around
6:30pm, and then northward up the middle of the channel until I lost sight of it. -Marianne Parry

I think we were visited by

Mon,

Entry 7:
Minke whale in San Juan Channel
: ... Winds increased from the South but we were able to find the minke whale and follow his swimming and surfacing patterns under sail. It was exciting to see the whale lunge on surfacing. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*
Minke whale in Griffin Bay
: ... We took our time as we passed the harbor seals with their pups and then moved quickly to cross Griffin Bay. A Minke whale was spotted by a passenger half way across the bay and we were able to watch as the whale circled the area surfacing around us. After picking a bunch of mylar balloons out of the ocean we continued South and tacked
across Cattle Pass to visit Deadman Island
