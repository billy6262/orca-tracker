Orca Sightings for July 24, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
~

20:00 - Orcas sighted from San Juan County Park
Friday
July 24th. I want to let you know that we spotted many Orcas heading south in the
Haro Strait
starting around
8:00 PM. -Justas Vilgalys, Woodinville, WA
*

21:20 -
Really nice
echolocation on Lime Kiln hydrophone
. Loudest I've heard all evening.
~

20:38 - Hearing calls, maybe some S4s
in there.

20:29 -
Thought was hearing little
L pod Lovelies on Lime Kiln hydrophone
now.

20:05 -
Sounds like kitty
(K) calls, believe S17s
, now blended with echo. I think of both S16 & S17 as kitty sounds. They are so similar, just didn't sound descending to me so went with S17, but honestly could have been either. Orcasound Lab

20:01 - Little L vocal
too. Orcasound Lab.

19:59 - Echolocation on Orcasound Lab
.

19:12 -
I'm either hearing some
SRWK calls
(confirmed later) or it's the tanker making noise (which it is, but aside from that...) on Orcasound Lab hydrophone. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

17:30 -
Hello--We saw
several orcas - at least 8 - at Turn Point on Stuart Island
on
July 24 around
5:30 pm. They rounded the point by the lighthouse and headed south towards Haro Strait. It was wonderful to see so many together. It's been a long time since I have seen a group like that. There were a couple boats following them. One (a tour boat?) appeared to send out a drone to fly over them. So you will likely have reports of same time /place. Thanks for tracking and recoding Orca info. My son and I would love to know what pod it was - if you have that info. Thank you, -Sarah Ogier

Center for Whale Research Encounter #34 with
K and L Pod
: "â€¦ Our colleague, Jared Towers, had encountered a few K pod whales and a little over half of L pod in Johnstone Strait two days earlier and they had arrived down here more or less when we expected them to. We arrived on scene with the leaders about a quarter mile
north of the west entrance to Prevost Harbor
at 1705.
L105
was the first whale we saw and a couple others were on the Stuart Island shoreline heading west toward Turn Point. Others, like the K16s and the L82s, were loosely spread behind the leaders and a larger group was reported to be behind these whales. ..." See CWR Encounter #34 for full encounter summary and more photos. https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-34

We are just returning home from a week of sea kayaking in San Juans. Our last day on the island we went out with Jeff Friedman and saw the mind-blowing return of the
SRKW's (L Pod and a few K's)
. Remarkable! -Steve Smith
*
Exciting sailing adventure today when it comes to whales! We got to sail with
humpback BCX0870 "Scoop", then some of L pod and K pod, and another humpback MMZ0004 "Zephyr."

BIGG'S/TRANSIENTS - Fri,

Entry 2:
Saratoga Passage to Admiralty Inlet (T46s and T65As)
-

20:37 - Saw three orcas under the Hood Canal Bridge
20 min ago! (~
20:17)...They were south of the bridge at the time I was crossing. -Megan Barnes
[
This presumably means someone peeled off the combined group earlier today. Another sighting on another group had them north of the bridge so they were southbound. - alb

*
~

19:45 -
At least three orcas were sighted just
south of the Hood Canal Bridge
midspan today (7/24/20) at approximately 1945 hours. -Alisha Gruszewski
*

17:45 -
Both groups of orcas a little more fragmented but still heading north
closer to Marrowstone Island, as seen from Lagoon Point
. -Sandra Pollard
*

17:30 -
Watching Orcas traveling Northbound mid-channel past
Bush Point
now. Looks like 4 males with one having smaller dorsal fin than the other 3. At least 6 additional Orcas, with smaller dorsal fins (likely females or young males)...Plus one very small young Orca. Thank you for all you do and your efforts! -Anna & Pip

Lighthouse.

16:10 - [orcas]
Just got to Shore Meadows. They are booking..straight out from Shore Meadows in line with yellow channel marker, NB. (updated: You know, when I first saw the orcas from Shore Meadows and once I got to Bush Point (They were in line with Foulweather Bluff and Hoods Canal entrance). There were at least 8+ orcas. after they passed Bush Point, I know I was seeing less. Makes sense now. A few most likely did split off?) -Marilyn Armbruster
*

3:55 -
Now they've group up and turning NW - yikes, impossible to keep up with these guys! They are doing what they did yesterday in Penn Cove, going back and forth.

(at least - T46s?) lagged behind, stopped to hunt, went back south
toward Pt. No Point

15:25 -
Seeing the pod now, viewing from
south of Bush Pt.
, Whidbey Island. They are
north of Pt. No Point/Hansville

We encountered them again today in a similar location.
SW of Possession Bar
in the shipping lane. They had just killed/eaten what I was likely a harbor porpoise. Our boat was in idle or with engine off and they were clearly in a celebratory mood. A few spy hops and playful tail slaps. I presume these are T65s (male with notches at top). I definitely saw
T46D
