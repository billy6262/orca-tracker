Orca Sightings for July 11, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (Js) -
Yesterday [
July 11] we watched as
some of the females of J-pod had a little social time with J56 "Tofino".
In the mix were
J31 "Tsuchi", J36 "Alki", J37 "Hy'shqa", and J40 "Suttles"
and they seemed to be having a lovely time rolling around together. It's so great to watch these whales interact with one another and we've been so grateful to have all of J-pod here this past week. -Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

I think it's Blackberry, judging from the giant dorsal fin, and his gang are still on this side between Eagle Point and False Bay. Leisurely going to and fro. Fairly close to shore.

13:33 -
From my view point I could see
small groups and single orca spread from Eagle Point to Pile Point
. Most of them not near the shore. One larger group of 5 - 7 quite far off eagle point. One breach. My estimate would be about 15-20 orca. Not a very scientific estimate though........... no single direction.

Entry 4:
Port Susan -

07:15 -
Today we watched a pod of Orcas go by. Time:
7:15 am, where: west Port Susan Sound. About 150 yards off of the south end of
East Camano Island
. They were headed south and going quickly. We saw 4 for sure. Possibly more but the sun hampered the sighting. There were 3 large adult orcas and one appeared to be young. It was much smaller and traveled right next to one of the large ones. We are assuming this is the transient pod that occasionally comes in here. It was a good way to start our morning. -Terri and Tom Smith, Camano Island

Entry 5:
San Juan Islands (T36s) -

July 11 out on IE5. We found the
T36
group just by
Cypress Island
and watched them be very active, on a kill though no evidence on the surface except gulls with bits of food. We then went and looked at some adorable harbor seals, eagles, turkey vultures, and even a kingfisher! We caught up with T36s again by Obstruction Pass...they were in travel mode in beautiful light. So happy!
