GRAY WHALES - Tue,

Entry 6:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

19:35 -
I had just finished my last email to you when we saw a gray
heading north past Mariners' Cove
, but pretty far out. I'm going to assume it was newbie 2356, who likely filled up its belly down by
Polnell Point
and is heading off somewhere to sleep it off. :) As I said, it was far from shore - maybe mid-channel between Mariners' Dove and Utsalady? It surfaced several times, but far apart, and showed a very arched back that it doesn't do close in with the shallow water (so guessing it's diving deeper maybe?). Have a great evening! -Marianne Parry
*

17:30 -
Just when I start to think it's moved on, good ol'
newbie 2356
pokes his head up - yay!! Feeding heavily and slowly making his way past Mariners Cove heading south. 7/7/30,
5:30pm. -Marianne Parry
