Entry 6:
Strait of Juan de Fuca -
To all of the fine folks [Jackie Hildering, Tasli Shaw, Doug Sandilands, Kiirsten Flynn, John Calambokidis, Ted Cheeseman, Jenn Tackaberry] involved with the entanglement of humpback whale "Phi" in July of last year. Fortunately, the entanglement was resolved without intervention. What none of us knew at the time was that during the entanglement episode... Phi was pregnant! Our naturalist Lee [Leddy] snapped these shots of
Phi and calf north of the Elwha
yesterday afternoon. Mom didn't fluke, but Tasli [Shaw] recognized the dorsal right away so big thanks for the ID assist! Such hapy news! [

On
July 5 there were
two Gray Whales
about half way between the

We saw the
two humpbacks in Skunk Way west of Point No Point
