Entry 2:
North Puget Sound/Northern Saratoga Passage to Penn Cove (T46s, T65As) -

Orcas still milling and making frequent directional changes between mussel rafts and Coupeville wharf. The T46s and T65As maintained a presence in and around Whidbey Island last week, including time spent in
Penn Cove
cruising among the mussel rafts hoping for easy pickings of tasty seal buffet. -Sandra Pollard

20:00 -
Sailed with the Orca last night just before sunset about
8:00 PM. Winds were 8-10 mph from the WSW with dense cloud cover. Hard to tell if there were 4 or 6. They were
off Rolling Hills
southwest of the racing mark. They seemed to be staying within a very limited area, swimming east then west over and over. They would surface 1-2 X then all dive for 5-6 minutes. 2-3 adults and at least two smaller ones. One male with a dorsal tipped to the right at about 60 degrees, just near the tip. Watched them from a safe distance for about 30 minutes before sailing to the boat launch. -Gary Piazzon PM

Orcas back in Penn Cove
! For sure the two big boys
T46D and T46E
. Here is T46D right at my feet at the mussel docks! There was another group that came in and they mingled around the wharf for quite a while. Awesome day! Updated: Wonderful day with the T46s and T65As in Penn Cove! Fairly active with some rolling, tail slapping, multi-directional changes, grouping up and then spreading out. Many people watching and enjoying these beauties in our front "yard". Pictures are from shore and heavily cropped. -Bonnie Gretz

Heading south
. Didn't get any additional looks. There was one adult male. But, not many other details. It was a brief encounter. They were right in the shipping lane. If I had to guess, I'd say they were heading more toward the kitsap side. -Josh London
