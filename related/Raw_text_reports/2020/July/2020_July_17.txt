BIGG'S/TRANSIENT ORCAS - Fri,

Entry 3:
Frederick Sound, AK- Tl’uk's pod
was up in our neighborhood by
Five Finger Lighthouse in Frederick Sound
this summer, on
July 17, attacking our humpback whales. The humpback adults exhibited heroic efforts to protect their calves, blocking and ramming the killer whales and eventually fending them off with no visible casualties. Besides this one brief appearance of Tl’uk, there was no other sighting of her participating in any of the attacks on the humpbacks. One of our board members, Stephanie, also saw them on
July 9th at the northern edge of Kupreanof Island, and she mentioned that someone else reported seeing them as they swam through the Wrangell Narrows around that time. -Kenneth O'Brien M.S., Lighthouse Keeper, Five Finger Lighthouse, Frederick Sound, AK

Entry 4:
South Puget Sound (T46s) -

16:15 -
I saw the T46s around
16:15 near
Minter Creek
and went out in my kayak. I watched them as they casually moved up the bay and about 1-2 km from Purdy, they turned around and slowly headed south along the west shore. At Minter Creek, a motor boat coming out of the Minter Lagoon seemed to scare them further out into the bay, where they found a harbor porpoise. Four of the orcas seemed to be actively hunting it (or playing with it - I would assume that they could have easily killed it quickly) for about 30 minutes and when it would come to the surface, its entire head would come out of the water, gasping for air. Three of the orcas left it alone with one of the young/females (I am not confident in identifying a female from a juvenile). When that happened, the porpoise was often able to stay near the dorsal fin of the orca and wasn't gasping for breath. That continued for another hour and a half in the same area. At about
20:00, the porpoise surfaced right behind my kayak and the younger male followed fairly closely, while the female/juvenile surfaced heading straight toward me - I thought that I was going to get hit but it was able to swerve and missed me (see the attached video - you can see the porpoise surface at the beginning). I left after that, so I don't know what happened to the porpoise (I have to think that they ended up killing it). I did hear them in the bay around midnight. -Tim Hoffnagle
*

12:58 -
There's been a pod of Orcas East of the Key Peninsula about a 1/3 of the way to
Cutts Island
due east of Glen Cove….I wonder if they were enjoying some Minter salmon hatchery fish. They were traveling north and south along what looked like a straight line the last 2 days. Our home is 200 feet above sea level at the mouth of Glen Cove. We see a little north of Raft Island to the mouth of Horse Head Bay. -Bill DeLeo

12:45 -
Today,

Entry 5:
four orca
at
12:45pm off Minter Creek. Looked like the same from yesterday. One male and 3 smaller. No pictures, but males dorsal was curved to the right at the top and had a notch about a third of the way down. They were milling around jumping and slapping their tails. We watched them for 30 minutes until they swam to the south out of sight. This sighting was off
Minter Creek
, closer to the west shore of
Henderson Bay
. -Kevin Stroh

Entry 10:
South Puget Sound -

14:30-

15:30 -
Earlier this afternoon I spent some time in a kayak following the
common dolphin in Case Inlet
, east off the northern point of
Harstine Island
. I first spotted at around
2:00 P.M., and I was kayaking with it from
2:30 to
3:30 P.M. For almost the entire time I was with it, the dolphin was following a boat that was moving slowly back and forth east of Hartstene Point. The boaters were fishing and didn't seem to be paying much attention to the dolphin. At
3:30 P.M. the dolphin left that boat and swam off to start following a sailboat that was moving southeast towards Herron Island. That's when I left the dolphin and returned to shore. Honestly, I'm quite concerned for this dolphin. Assuming it is from the same pod of common dolphins that came down to South Puget Sound in 2016, it seems to be the only dolphin left here. Over these past couple months, we've been seeing a pair of common dolphins in this same area, but the two dolphin sightings that I've had so far this month have been of a lone dolphin. Also, I found the behavior of this dolphin to be unusual. While I know it is normal for dolphins to approach boats and play in their wakes, the time that the dolphin spent with the boat (over an hour) seemed to me to be unusual, and when it finally left that boat it went on to follow another boat. I'm worried that it may not be long before there will be no resident dolphins in South Puget Sound, but I'm certainly no expert. [ID notes by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective: "This is the one we call Cinco, he's a young male long-beaked common dolphin. He is the fifth and last individual we were able to uniquely identify from the group that arrived in 2016. While we were pretty sure he was a male due to his size, it's only in the last year that he developed the post-anal keel (the lump near his tail) that confirmed his sex."] -Connor O'Brien
