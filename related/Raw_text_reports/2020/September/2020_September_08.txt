Tue, Sept 8 -
San Juan Islands (T18s) -
We had been following earlier reports of orcas known as the
T65Bs
who had been southbound along the west side of San Juan Island. When they reached
Cattle Point
, they made a sharp turn and continued to
Hein Bank
. At first they seemed out of range for us so we skirted Salmon Bank looking for minke whales. We later realized that the orcas had stopped near the Hein Bank marker and were just hanging out for the last hour. We decided to step on it with the hopes to see them. Unfortunately, as we got closer, they decided to begin travel again at about 6 knots westbound in the opposite direction eventually crossing the border. We came about and decided to head back in towards Lopez Island. Another report came in from the Ferry who spotted orcas near Thatcher Pass. A whale watch boat was in the area and found them southbound along the Lopez coastline. It turned out to be the T18's and they were moving fast in our direction. We continued our course crossing over McAurthur Bank scanning for minkes, but instead found loads of diving birds. As we neared Colville Island, we spotted the blows and tall fins of the two big males. The family of four orcas were traveling together at first but soon separated traveling parallel to each other as they moved westbound. After some nice looks we decided it was time to start making our way back to the barn. photo - "Sailing with

18:30 - T65Bs
continued west. At around
6:30 PM the
T18s
were heading west as well. The T65Bs were coming back East (they had gone further west in the strait). They were both on a heading and speed to meet very soon after.----On Tuesday evening,
September 8, I was able to spend some time with the T18s in Eastern Juan de Fuca Strait. The matriarchal nature of their culture was fully on display as the big boys T19B and T19C spent time in close proximity with their mother and grandmother. One son would go with Mom and the other with Grandma and after a bit they would switch up. The size of the dorsal fins on these guys is awe-inspiring, made all the more interesting by the left-leaning tendency and thickness of T19B's giant fin. They zigzagged in a northwesterly fashion, which was ironically on a heading in which the T65B's were coming from the opposite direction. We know these two family units have been meeting up over the past week in the San Juan Islands - are these pre-planned meet-ups? All photos taken with 600mm lens and cropped. photos - [IDs: Debbie] "

GRAY WHALES - Tue, Sept 8 - Northern Saratoga Passage -
~

10:00-

11:15 -
I just had a long and amazing visit with
2261. Gray
came up from the happy meal mudflats to the south of us about 10am (right around high tide, 9'), feeding and showing off, and slowly worked its way right up to our house (southern tip of
Mariners Cove
). After more feeding and fin-waving, it surprised me and turned around and went back to the mudflats, fed for a good half hour, and then came back up here to our house once again! Double-bonus!! It was still feeding as it moved along, but not as much as the first pass. So awesome - just me and Gray, no boats or nothin'. By around
11:15am, a bunch of crossing boat traffic started showing up, so Gray dove down and headed out into the channel toward northern tip of Camano, where I finally lost sight of it in the smoky haze. Also, my neighbor says he saw it here at Mariners Cove at
7:30am. -Marianne Parry

MINKE WHALES - Tue, Sept 8 - â€¦we saw
two minkes
and common murres and a puffin near

Set out today from Edmonds in thick wildfire smoke that blew in overnight from various parts of the state. We found a very curious
Minke whale
in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
that circled the boat to check us out. -Janine Harles
