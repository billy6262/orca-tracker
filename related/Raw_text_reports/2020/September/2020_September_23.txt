Orca Sightings for September 23, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tue, Sept 23 - Strait of Georgia - Last night we had a lovely visit (a
few miles SW of Point Roberts
) with the
Southern Residents
and they were socializing and catching salmon left and right! We love to see whales breaching but we love seeing them with salmon even more! photo - "

GRAY WHALES - Wed, Sept 23 - Northern Saratoga Passage - I did not expect to be filing any sighting reports today due to the crazy weather! No way to hear puffs and not likely to spot them amongst the whitecaps! However, a tip from my friends to the south alerted me to
a Gray (presumably 2261) heading north
in my direction, and I was lucky enough to spot it a few minutes ago. It was south of Utsalady at first, but had cruised up to about the level of the red buoy (on maps? Not sure)
between Utsalady and Mariners Cove
. The rain front moved directly at me and obscured the water toward Camano for a few minutes so I lost sight of it, but that has cleared up again a bit now so I'll update if I see puffs again. -Marianne Parry
