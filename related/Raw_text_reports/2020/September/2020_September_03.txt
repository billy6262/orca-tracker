Over the course of an hour spread out traveling both singly and in small groups,
20+ individuals northbound from Pile Point area towards and past Edwards Point
. Many breaches within those groups. At
15:00 J56 Tofino bounced along with a group of seven. J56 breached 10 times. She jumped and jumped, launching herself so high in the air. She aborted a few jumps and flopped over sideways making a big splash. She tail lobbed; big slaps. Practice, practice, practice little Tofino. What a spirited girl.

Allie Hudec called: She and Chris are on the ferry from Port Townsend to Whidbey and are seeing orcas on port side and further off. Looked like heading back out,
heading north
, but others milling. Right out from
Fort Worden
in ferry lanes, ferry had to turn wide to avoid.

Jill Hein texted again to report the orca she has eyes on is finally past (west of)
Port Townsend
. She has only been seeing the male. She reports a lot of sun glare. This guy is just about to Fort Worden.

Jill texted:
Orcas
seem to be milling and slightly drifting south. They are still not at Port Townsend.

Jill called: She is still seeing orcas closer to
Port Townsend
side, appear to be just west of ferry traffic lanes.

15:05 -
Jill Hein texted that she is seeing whales from
Fort Casey

8-10 whales
, too far for pics. Northbound.

Pod is at least
10 orcas
with a very large male. They are still flipping salmon up in the air just north of Kingston. Sorry for the grainy photos, didn't want to get too close.

feasting mid channel off
Rose Point/Eglon
. Counted at least 8 so far. I'm a ways away but hopefully one of these photos helps identify the pod. -Tom Rider

GRAY WHALES - Thu, Sept 3 - Northern Saratoga Passage -

23:15 -
We stepped out on the deck late last night and wondered where
Gray
was hanging out, and it literally answered with a big puff from the "happy meal mudflats" just south of
Mariners Cove
. It sounded like it was feeding out there, slowly moving toward Polnell. 9/3/2020,

23:15 - assuming it was 2261 but obv couldn't see it.
~

12:30 - A Gray (presumably 2261)
popped up at the mudflats just south of Mariners Cove around
12:30 today (9/3/20). It was probably a little early tide-wise for a proper feeding because it disappeared around the corner toward Polnell, where I was told that it took off across the channel to Camano. Have a good one! -Marianne Parry
