Orca Sightings for September 15, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
GRAY WHALES - Tue, Sept 15 - Northern Saratoga Passage -

11:00-

11:30 - Gray 2261
(presumably) is passing by
Mariners Cove
heading south toward Polnell. It wasn't feeding much as it approached from the north but started feeding as it passed my place and approached the happy meal mudflats. It's pretty close to shore but it's just under 1' tide so still pretty far out there. Smoke is thick and bright, but I can see the outline clearly and hear the puffs. As of
11:30, it is at the mudflats feeding, but still moving south as far as I can tell, but it's disappearing into the mist at this point. -Marianne Parry

UNIDENTIFIED SPECIES - Tue, Sept 15 - Central Puget Sound -
~

15:45 -
My neighbors and I saw a minke whale very close to shore in front of our condominiums yesterday, Sept. 15, 2020, approximately
3:45 p.m. It was northbound about
1 mile south of the Fauntleroy Ferry in West Seattle
. Its dorsal fin and size were distinct compared to the humpbacks, orcas and harbor seals we've seen. A worker on site said he saw it jump twice and described its tail. I saw it roll to the surface as it traveled fairly fast northbound. Moments later I saw splashing/disturbance at the buoy of a neighbor's boat and assumed it was the whale but we did not see it again. It happened too fast for a photo, but it was exciting. -Carolyn Duncan
