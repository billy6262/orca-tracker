Orca Sightings for September 19, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sat, Sept 19 -

23:55 - [SRKWs]
They are in front of me in
Active Pass
going north into
Strait of Georgia
. (second group here!! [
12:18 a.m.]) -Rachelle Hayden

Meet the
newest member of J-pod, J57
!! Today we had a heart warming experience watching
J35, Tahlequah
, frolicking with her new calf J57, who was born just 14 days ago! In 2018 Tahlequah made news around the world when she carried her calf, that died shortly after birth, for 17 days straight. Her tour of mourning, that covered approximately 1,000 miles, brought the decline of the Southern Resident Killer Whale population to a global stage! Today there is a buzz of excitement and hope in the whale community, both for mom, who endured so much in 2018, and for the new calf. J57 brings the SRKW population up to 73. We don't know if the calf is a boy or a girl yet, but we almost got the chance to answer that question today when mom lifted up little J57 out of the water with her rostrum a couple of times. This is a pretty common bonding behavior we see with moms and their calves. You can determine the sex of the calf if you see it's underside in just the right spot. At times it almost looked as if mom was showing off her new calf! She must have known how excited everyone is for her. On Sept 5, 2020
shortly after J57 was born, all three SRKW pods (J, K, and L) joined together in a huge superpod party
! They appeared to be celebrating the new birth in one of their favorite stomping grounds - Haro Strait off the west side of San Juan Island. The orcas were breaching, spyhopping, tailslapping, rolling around each other, and vocalizing so loudly that you could hear them above the surface!! -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

17:20-

17:55 - 5 orcas northbound 1/4 mile south of Edwards Pt
. including J26 Mike and J38 Cookie. All were milling, splashing with 2 breaches. They disappeared to the northwest except for J26 Mike who stayed swimming just under the surface in tight circles back and forth, his big fin snapping left and right. I often get a chance to watch Mike doing this; a concentrated, focused determination. I assume looking for a fish.

14:42-

14:49 -
Spread out,
9+ orcas southbound passing Edwards Pt
. including
L72 Racer and L105 Fluke
. A tight group of three unidentified and NOAA following L103 Lapis with her son L123 Lazuli.

13:24-

14:24 -
Spread out, 6-7+ orcas observed traveling northbound
1/2 mile south of Edwards Pt.
The few that were close enough to see saddle patches were members of L-Pod. The group split, some traveling north past Edwards Point, others farther out to the northwest. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

13:08 - Field of J, K and L going north towards False Bay.
Far out. Coast guard with them. -Karin Roemers-Kleven

13:06 -
We saw
L4s, L47s, J16s, and J17s
so I can confirm at least Js and Ls. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express
*
Seen the
J pod
today!!! San Juan!! Also seen mama and baby today too!!! -Samantha Whidden
*
The orcas were northbound at
Eagle Point
so we pushed on with a fast beam reach sail and met them at Pile Point. Bringing in the headsail and drifting we watched the
J17's plus J38, L82 and L116
were all engaged in foraging. We dropped the hydrophone to listen to thier calls. We saw
J35 with her brand new calf, J57
, just two weeks old and staying close to mum.
K20
passed off shore. We did hear of 2 orcas engaged with a harbor porpoise. We left them to continue North on the flood as they turned South… -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
*

12:38 - Orcas spread from Eagle Point to False Bay
. Mostly stalled...moving a bit northish. Some in close to shore, some much farther out. Very nice! Quiet behavior. Hanging in small groups and singles. -Chris Wilson

heading NW. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Hi there. We spotted a
large pod of orcas
this morning (around 10am) from
Hughes Bay on Lopez Island
. About 10-25 or so of them (roughly), various sizes, moving westbound, maybe between 100 and 500 yards offshore. Some playing and breaching. -Kurtis Dengler

BIGG'S/TRANSIENTS - Sat, Sept 19 -
N Strait of Georgia -
Thinking of this family a lot the last few days. The last time we saw
T102
with them is 5 days ago as of today. He wasn't looking well, fin had lost rigidity and he was coming up sideways with a lean to the right.......I will hold out hope. Seeing them slowly running through the Hole in the Wall yesterday [9/19] was magical.......blows echoing the cliff walls and mom in between her two boys. photo - 9/19
T101, T101A, T101B
- photo - "T102
August 19, 2020 Sentry Shoal. Him and Mom have been together all morning behind the boys.....they all met up at Sentry and this guy blew us away with two big breaches"-Nick Templeman, Campbell River Whale & Bear Excursions

GRAY WHALES - Sat, Sept 19 - Northern Saratoga Passage -
Gray Whale #2261
was in our neighborhood cove in
Oak Harbor
, WA three different times today: breakfast, lunch and dinner. He/she made the typical runs along our coastline and headed toward
Crescent Harbor
. Wow! Talk about carbo-loading! -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA
*
After a three-day break,
Gray 2261
has returned! I suppose it might have been here all along and we just couldn't see it because of the smoke, but we didn't hear anything either, so not sure. Two sightings today:

14:30 - Gray 2261
came back southbound this time, and went right for the mudflats. It was feeding, and just creeping along very slowly toward Polnell.

12:30 - Gray 2261
came up from
Polnell
and fed at the happy meal mudflats, but then headed out into the channel and swam north. -Marianne Parry

DOLPHINS - Sun, Sept 19 - Central Puget Sound -

19:06
- Hi everyone. A fellow WSF worker caught a picture of an active
dolphin/porpoise between southworth and Fauntleroy
. Not sure what it is. I know harbor porpoise rarely show that much. Any ideas? [
common dolphin -alb
] Last I heard the dolphin was still around the Southworth area until almost dark. The dolphin was playing in the prop wash as the ferries were coming in. Time was approximately 5pm 9/19/2020, picture was taken by WSF employee Chris Roswold. He did give permission to use the picture! As of today, have not heard of any activity. Hope that helps. Thanks for your help with identifying it!!! -Wayne McFarland, WSF
*

09:35 - I think this is
Cinco the dolphin
. He has been playing off the
Vashon ferry terminal
most of this morning according to the ferry workers. -Abbie Rose Fiano
[
Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research, notes on Abby's videos: "With a quick look at all the videos, I couldn't make a positive ID from the markings (though that may change later, or with additional pictures or video). That said, the behavior includes some of his trademark moves, and reactions to people watching him. It
has to be Cinco
. When they were in the South Sound, there was a period where the common dolphins would regularly wake ride the Steilacoom ferries, so this wouldn't be anything new for him."

Sun and Mon, Sept 18 and 19 - Central Puget Sound
- Hello, I have lived near Puget Sound for 65 years. Have never seen dolphins. I had one follow my boat on Sept 18th @
4:00 pm for close to an hour. Just south of Des Moines marina. Went to Tacoma the next day and saw a second one, smaller than the other, at mouth of Foss Waterway. I have lots of video. Video link & maps attached. -Richard Becker
[
Per Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective: "The one in the first encounter, in the first two videos, is almost certainly
Cinco
based on behavior and general appearance. On watching the third video, we both had the same immediate reaction of "that doesn't look like anything we've ever seen Cinco do". The body shape and the color don't look quite right, the fluke staying in the water, and little twist just isn't like him. I can't confirm that it's not him, but I don't believe that it's him. That video was great quality, one of the best I've received, but it just wasn't close enough to know for sure."
