Center for Whale Research Encounter #49: "… They soon confirmed
K33
and moved slowly through the area to conclude that the animals were spread out from north to south in a line as they slowly worked their way west with brief foraging dives. The Mike 1 crew was only able to find six animals,
K33, K26, L54, L88, L108, and L117
. It was likely that the K12's, K14's and L54's were there in their entirety, but with the limited visibility, they were not able to confirm. Perhaps there were some others that were well ahead or behind. …" [See CWR Encounter #49 for full encounter summary and photos.] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-49

GRAY WHALES - Mon, Sept 14 - Northern Saratoga Passage -
~

12:15 -
Thanks to a helpful tip, I was on the lookout for Gray, and it showed up maybe

12:15-ish at
Mariners cove
, arriving from Polnell Point. It cruised by pretty quickly and as of
12:45, I can hear it but it's out of sight to the north. It's staying along Whidbey so far instead of heading into the channel.... Actually, as I write this, I'm hearing louder puffs again so maybe it has turned out into the channel - the smoke is so thick I just can't get a visual. I got a few glimpses of it as it passed by me - it was not very close in, and I could just barely see it in the smoke. It did not appear to be feeding - no fins or tails, and no big noggin' lifting out of the water - just very low-profile and short surfacing. Maybe the smoke is bugging it after all. -Marianne Parry
