Wow, this is interesting. Last night [27th], I was on the beach at
Fort Casey
and a fisherman shouted Orcas! I was farther down the beach but I could see lots of spouts way out and also saw a number of porpoises closer in than usual. All just straight out. I know there are a lot of sea lions out there but they don't spout! And it could have been just a bunch of porpoises. Probably so. But sure makes me wonder. It was probably around 6 p.m. -Ron Newberry

Sun, Sept 27 -
Strait of Juan de Fuca (K pod)

20:18 - Calls again!

19:41 -
Started hearing
Southern Resident orcas off the west side of San Juan Island
. Distant calls can be heard on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
It started with a lovely calm evening, glassy clear water, and a stunning sunset followed by one of the most beautiful whale moments I've ever had. We had been watching one orca from
K Pod
in the distance as the sun was going down, and as we stood in the dark thinking they weren't going to come north, we started hearing blows getting closer and closer to where we were standing. Suddenly they were passing by right next to shore. We could hear their breathing and see their silhouettes in the moonlight with bioluminescence all around them. It was magical. No camera, no binoculars, just being in the moment with the whales. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network
*

20:20 - K-Pod vocalizing on the LK hydrophone
for 9 minutes. Uplifting gorgeous calls.

20:04-

20:12 - Northbound
. A group of 3-5, very close in along the shore. I could just make out one large male in the moonlight. Multiple breaches so close in, the sound a massive assault (in the best possible way).

19:43-

20:00 - 4-7 orcas northbound
, including 3 in a tight group, just
south of Edwards Point
. The night was so still and sound was carrying very far. The 2 large males were rapid firing tail lobs that echoed off the bluffs and hillsides! Surface vocalizations were heard from one sky hopping individual. More orcas were heard farther from shore.

18:50-

19:30 - K34 Cali northbound 1/4 mile south of Edwards Point
. K34 circled while slowly making his way past the point drifting northwest. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
*

18:37 - Southern Resident K Pod orcas
are here! They've reached the south end of San Juan Island and they're trending up island, northbound. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

16:30-

19:10 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #53: "Reports of Southern Residents coming in the Strait of Juan de Fuca had been pouring in all day. The whales were spread out and some began moving over to the American side of the border when they were off Port Angeles. When we got word that the whales were heading north towards San Juan Island, Dave, Katie, and Kelley met down at Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1540. The whales were still southwest of
Hein Bank
when we left and we finally arrived on scene a little west of Hein Bank at 1630. The whales were spread out in singles and small groups from west to east in the Hein Bank area. All the whales were pointed at either Eagle Point or South Beach on San Juan Island. â€¦" [See CWR Encounter #53 for full encounter summary and more photos. https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-53

They came east in through the Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon, reaching the shores of San Juan Island just before sunset. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Sept 27 - Strait of Juan de Fuca -

12:15-

12:30 -
I had another sighting of an orca pod, this time in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, while I was fishing yesterday. It was a
large pod of 12 or 15
though might have been more, as they were rather spread out. They were traveling eastward from a couple miles off
Angeles Point
,

12:15 -
12:30 in the afternoon. A lot of leaping and splashing at one point by several. Passing along some photos, which are cropped a lot to bring enlargement. Didn't think transient pods get this big, but perhaps they do. One shot shows
Race Rocks Lighthouse
, for bearings. [One] photo shows what I thought was a youngster. (additional info: The boats were in the Yellow Buoy area and the whales swung to the east around them, but did seem to be heading generally in a nw direction to reach the Yellow buoy area from Angeles point area. Exciting to hear of these young calves being born.) -Tim Roos
