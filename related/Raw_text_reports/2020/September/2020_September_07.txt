Our pal
Gray 2261
was back for his third day in a row of pre-happy-hour snacks. It came cruising by moderately close to shore at

3:45-4ish here at
Mariners Cove
, so about 15-30 minutes later each day. It stopped at our flagpole for a minute to wave, but then continued on to the happy meal mudflats just south of us. It appeared to feed a little bit, but rather than continue south toward Polnell, it turned toward Camano and did an impressive sprint toward Utsalady. That whale can really haul a__ when it wants to - lol! It's so amazing to watch it do the big back arch, followed by that huge tail flip - just wow. -Marianne Parry
