Center for Whale Research Encounter #46: "… We saw our first whale at
1705 off Hannah Heights
although it soon disappeared on us. To the south off
False Bay, we found J51, J27, and K36
spread out and foraging.
J27 and K36
briefly came together before spreading out again. Due to heavy smoke mixing with fog, we had only about a half mile of visibility. A half mile of visibility in Haro Strait would be the best we had for the next week. …" [See CWR Encounter #46 for full encounter summary and photos.] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-46

BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Fri, Sept 11 -
Srait of Juan de Fuca -

10:18-

12:11 -
Center for Whale Research Encounter #45: "… Mark spotted a pair of bulls at the edge of their visibility. It looked as though they were pointed towards them so they shut down and waited. What seemed like an eternity, a bull popped up abeam of them working its way back to the original sighting location. They eventually got confirmation of T049A1 but no sign of the other bull. In the reduced visibility it was hard to keep their bearings and every time they thought they had found the other bull it turned out to be
T049A1
. They decided to end the encounter and make their way towards the Nitinat River bar to get out of the fog. As they were taxiing away
T049A3 and T049A4
appeared. Once they got decent pictures for proof of presence the Mike 1 crew ended the encounter at 1211…" [See CWR Encounter #45 for full encounter summary and photos.] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-45

Fri, Sept 11 -
Strait of Georgia (T123s) -
West of Sucia we met up with the T123s, a pod of four Bigg's killer whales that frequent Salish Sea waters. Mama Sidney (T123) and her three kids seemed to be scouting for prey, maintaining long down times interrupted by periodic episodes of milling and circling at the surface. They passed by Clements Reef where about a dozen Steller sea lions were playing a life-and-death round of king of the rock (don't want to be the sea lion shoved into the water with Bigg's around), then continued on towards Echo Bay. We got some great looks at this pod when they decided to switch up their direction of travel, and pass by the starboard side. As we were leaving the whales, we crossed paths with two swimming Steller sea lions, and questioned why they were swimming in the direction of the pod of Bigg's. -Sam, Island Adventures (Anacortes)

GRAY WHALES - Fri, Sept 11 - Northern Saratoga Passage -
~

09:00 -
I was afraid I'd miss our friend
Gray 2261
today because the windows are closed due to smoke and I wouldn't hear it. Luckily, I happened to see it coming down the beach at about 9am. It is moving pretty quickly, feeding more as it got closer to the mudflats. It's heading toward
Polnell
, as far as I can tell. I'm hoping this smoke doesn't bother Gray too much. -Marianne Parry
