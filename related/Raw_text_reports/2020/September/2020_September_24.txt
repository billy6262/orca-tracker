Orca Sightings for September 24, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mon, Sept 24 - Strait of Juan de Fuca (J, K, and L pods) -

17:00 -
"Late in the afternoon, reports from PWWA naturalists suggested that
a southern resident killer whale had given birth southwest of Race Rocks
. A Victoria-based whale-watch vessel had happened across the animals at approximately 1520 on their way home from viewing humpback whales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca (Canadian whale-watchers focus their tours on Bigg's killer whales and humpback whales). While slowing to identify and then allow the resident killer whales to pass, the crew enlisted Mark's help over radio to
identify J41 as the female with a minutes-old calf
. On the heels of the reports, Mark left Victoria harbour at 1700 in an effort to confirm the new mother/calf pair. â€¦" [See CWR Encounter #52 for full encounter summary and more photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-52

GRAY WHALES - Thu, Sept 24 - Northern Saratoga Passage -

13:47 -
DreAnn Csorba called to report seeing
a whale
. They are sitting at beach on NAS Whidbey, new to the area so not sure name of the beach. She thought humpback or gray [yes gray], is very gray and big. Looks like whale is feeding, it's surfacing then goes under in shallows, close to shoreline. They will be there for another 20 minutes and have been there for 20 minutes observing the whale. (Follow-up call: They were on
Crescent Harbor
side of Whidbey. Whale was surprise, they were just sitting at the beach and whale exhaled making for exciting encounter.)
