Orca Sightings for September 20, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S/TRANSIENTS - Sun, Sept 20 -
E Strait of Georgia (T123s) -
Our cruise took us past Barnes & Clark, the Sisters, Matia, and deep into the Strait of Georgia. It was south of Point Roberts that we found the T123s cruising the harbor porpoise rich waters. As we arrived,
Stanley (T123A)
could be seen scouting off on his own, while
Sidney (T123)
and her youngest were sticking close together. At one-point Sidney and Darcy were moving fast enough beneath the surface to create a wake of their own, likely chasing down porpoise, but no kill could be seen. We cruised with the ladies for a while before their behavior abruptly changed. Stanley must have given them the signal that he'd made a kill, because the three started racing towards him,
Darcy (T123D)
dramatically porpoising as she went. As little Darcy got closer to her brother, porpoising turned into play, with frequent belly rolls at the surface and a dramatic aerial backflip. We drifted with the pod as they milled at the surface with their presumably harbor porpoise meal. We did see evidence of a kill in the form of lungs floating at the surface. Stanley wowed us all with a dramatic spyhop, and Lucky showed off her moonwalk as they tore into the prey. It was an amazing thing to be witness to, and a truly memorable afternoon on the water. -Sam, Island Adventures (Anacortes)

GRAY WHALES - Sun, Sept 20 - Northern Saratoga Passage -
~

12:30 - Gray
made an appearance yesterday (9/20/2020) afternoon - yay! It showed up initially around
12:30 crossing
from the Polnell area into the channel heading northward
. I thought it was heading for Camano, but instead it went north mid-channel for about 30 minutes and then headed straight for the Mariners Cove marina entrance (a bit north of where I am). By
1:30pm, it was actually right inside the mooring buoy that sits outside the marina (see photos). It appeared to keep going northward (toward Strawberry Point perhaps?) but it was out of my sight by then. -Marianne Parry

DOLPHINS - Sun, Sept 20 - Central Puget Sound - I took a few videos of the
dolphin
yesterday. One of the ferry attendants said the dolphin has been
following the Vashon ferries for 2 days
now. This dolphin kept swimming under the boat as it was docked at Vashon and you can hear the echolocation when he come up for air, quite fascinating! I've never seen this type of dolphin in the sound before. Hope he/she is ok. -Emily White via Kim M. Parsons, Ph.D., (NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Science Center)
[
per Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective: "It's hard to confirm the rather small nick in his [Cinco's] dorsal fin in video from above, or while underwater. Sometimes we can see the pattern of the spots from his recent skin condition, but we haven't had anything from the ferry that was clear enough to say for certain."

16:44 -
Charlie, WSF, MV Issaquah, called to report a
lone dolphin
[reported as Pacific white-sided dolphin, but likely the Common dolphin - alb] over the past few hours at least right at
Vashon dock
. Really playful around the ferry as they are landing at dock. When they are at the dock dolphin is playing super close to the back of the boat in a relaxed fashion, just kind of doing that over and over. Dolphin was there prior to his shift at 1pm until now. Any time ferry comes in to Vashon dock they've been seeing it.
