11:34 - 2 orcas
were sighted 1/2 mile south of
Edwards Point
and were reported to be the
T065Bs
. Far out, they were northbound. As I watched the T065Bs the
T018s
appeared close in moving north. I noted that
T019B "Galiano"
had a new scratch on his saddle patch since last I saw him on 8-3-20.
T018, T019, T019B and T019C
moved together in a tight group passing Edwards Point. This is a lovely family, the males massive next to the females. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Sun, Sept 6 - NE of
Texada Island, B.C. -

08:20 - â€¦pod of 4 orca
we saw in Jervis Inlet (east of Egmont, BC). I'm wondering about the T18s as it looked like at least two big males and one definitely had a "floppy" fin. It was about
8:20am on
September 6th, and I heard the T18s were in the Juan de Fuca strait a couple of days later. -Samantha Sampson
[
I'd say it's the
T101s
(mom T101 and her 3 adult sons). I'll do some more looking around and confirm. Prelim is based on the 3 males...the one leaning likely T102, he's oldest and big right leaning dorsal. -Alisa
