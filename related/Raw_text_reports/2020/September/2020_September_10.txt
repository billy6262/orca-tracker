Entry 1:
Wed, Sept 10 - Strait of Juan de Fuca -

08:39-

17:53 - Center for Whale Research Encounter #44: "… When they were
~5 miles south of the entrance to Port of San Juan (Port Renfrew)
, Hanna, who was scanning from outside the cabin, motioned to Mark that she had spotted a breach off to the southwest towards an outbound container ship. She figured it was likely a humpback whale, but Mark felt it was a good idea to confirm. When they were within a mile of the ship, it was obvious that there was a large group of killer whales westbound in the outbound shipping lane. They confirmed that they had
J pod
in its entirety grouped up moving slowly west. Mark took advantage of the calm seas and started scanning with the binoculars while they waited for J's to resurface to see if more members of the Clan were nearby. Sure enough! He spotted a huge number of small blows a couple of miles to the west. After a couple more sequences with J's, Mike 1 proceeded to the west to confirm the others. It turned out to be
two large groups of a mix of K's and L's in each
, and both groups were heading east towards the J's. The lead group of K's and L's met up with J's, and after a short greeting with visible signs of excitement, the Clan split up into three big mixed groups as the trailing eastbound group arrived. …" [See CWR Encounter #44 for full encounter summary and more photos.] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-44

BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Thu, Sept 10 -
Haro Strait -
It was a pretty cool evening out there watching the
T18s, T65Bs, T60D, and T60E pursue a minke whale for nearly fifteen miles before it eluded them
.

These whales, the
T18s and T65Bs
(possibly having joined up with more), are now
south of Discovery Island
, reportedly chasing a minke whales as they aim back towards San Juan Island. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

At
10:30 Haley Eldridge callled to report seeing pod of
8-12 orcas in Haro Strait
this morning, observed from

07:30-
10:00. They first saw and watched the orcas moving southbound from
County Park
. They then moved down island and watched from Land Bank/Westside Preserve. The pod was more mid channel where they hung out in the middle for a while, eventually moving further offshore and were last seen heading west, directionally, toward Victoria, B.C. Lots of spyhopping, playing, breaching at one point. Too far to see saddles or which ecotype. One large male had distinct backward-looking/leaning dorsal.

GRAY WHALES - Thu, Sept 10 - Northern Saratoga Passage -
#2261 was leisurely feeding around Polnell Point
today. He/she doesn't seem to be in any hurry to go to Alaska! -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA
*

11:00-

11:20 - Gray 2261
apparently went down to
Polnell Shores
and then turned around and came back up here! I've been watching him for a good 30 min or so. It came back up to Mariners Cove and then finally decided to head out into the channel. The buffet ran out of dessert apparently - lol. It's now
11:20am and it is heading across the channel toward northern tip of Camano. I can hear the puffs but losing visuals in the haze.

08:20-

08:50 -
I heard the familiar puff at
8:20am, and watched it feeding southward for about 45 minutes. Today's dance moves were less like ballet and more like a rock concert (classic rock of course) - lots of fins waving in the air and really splashing and churning up the water, with little sideways movement. Progress was much slower than usual, just moving a very short distance between rolls. It appeared to be heading toward Polnell, and Greg and Terra just said they can see it from the beach but still up in my direction (
9:25). -Marianne Parry

MINKE WHALES - Thu, Sept 10 - It was a pretty cool evening out there watching the
T18s, T65Bs, T60D, and T60E pursue a minke whale
for nearly fifteen miles before it eluded them. Afterwards, the orcas grouped up and had some social time. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

DOLPHINS - Thu, Sept 10 -

14:35 -
I believe there is a
Pacific Dolphin off Apple Tree Point [Kingston]
. Not a porpoise, lighter grey, moving fast and porpoising along. Only see one. [Follow up] It was moving pretty fast and away from me. It definitely was not a porpoise. I did not get a good enough look. [to confirm which type -alb]. -Sara Frey
