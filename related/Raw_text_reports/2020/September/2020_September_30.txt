Orca Sightings for September 30, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Wed, Sept 30 -
Haro Strait to Strait of Georgia (J pod)
- Yesterday evening [9/30] in a glassy calm Strait of Georgia I had the privilege of 'meeting' the newest member of Jpod. This little kiddo belongs to
J41 "Eclipse". J51 "Nova"
was in close attendance the whole time and I can't help but wonder how he's adjusting to his new role of big brother. Welcome to the world, little one. photo - "J41 "Eclipse" and her newest kiddo." -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

picked up on
Orcasound Lab hydrophone
(1 km south of Snug Harbor) by a brand-new experimental automated detection system built by Microsoft hackathon volunteers! Will post a full recording on orcasound.net /blog but moderator consensus is likely
J pod
(lots of S1s, S4s) and timing matches when they exited Admiralty last night (Port Townsend detections by human listeners ~
19:00), so perhaps they were northbound in Haro? -Scott Veirs, Orcasound
