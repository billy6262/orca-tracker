Hello! I would like to report an Orca sighting: On Friday

Entry 2:
about 5 orcas breaching in Carr Inlet between Glencove and Cutts Island State Park
, WA while out kayaking. One of the orcas appeared to be
albino
. We first noticed the orcas around
4:45 pm near Glencove, and we watched them slowly
move north up Henderson Bay until about
5:20 pm.

I did end up seeing more as they turned around and started heading SW towards the inlet... one large orca w/3 smaller ones.

There's a small orca in the far end of
Henderson Bay
right now. Almost to Purdy Spit area. Looks like it's all by him/herself. -Chris Reed

13:28 -
We live on Forest Beach Dr NW, Gig Harbor. We face west and
Henderson Bay
is out front. The orcas were out front yesterday and again today -
heading north towards Purdy
. They also were here about a week ago. Same drill. Sadly, several boats were waaaaaay too close to them - looked practically right next to them. Very disappointing. Must be decent feeding right now. -Maggie Walter

The orcas are back. There were
8-10 of them, including Tl'uk
and the male with the bent dorsal fin. They were heading leisurely toward
Purdy
when I left them at about
08:30. There were two males and a larger group yesterday but today, only one male and he was always with (closely with) a female. Yesterday, I noticed that one of the males was also always closely with a female and I got a video of him holding completely still near the surface for maybe a minute. -Tim Hoffnagle

Entry 3:
April 10th,
several gray whales were feeding off the shore at Port Susan Terrace
, east side of Camano. It was late afternoon. Always exciting! Watching from our window for sea life is a great antidote for these stressful times we all find ourselves in. -Mary Pelland

Entry 4:
17:00 -
Jeremy Rubingh,
Shilshole
, called on
April 11th to report seeing
a large whale
while out sailing the evening before (10th). The whale was 1/2 way out in the channel and just
north of Golden Gardens
. He first heard a blow, then saw the exhalation of large whale. Dark in color, no white coloring, but no obvious dorsal either so unsure if gray or humpback. The whale was heading southbound.
