Orca Sightings for April 1, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet -

19:27 -
Sighting off PNP: "I followed the group with my binoculars as they headed N. Based on counting blows, I believe there were
10+ orcas
. One adult male for sure but possibly 2-3. Hard to see with the glare. We are staying at a house on the beach and just barely spotted their blows as they swam by. I can still barely see them, must be
off N. Mutiny Bay or near Bush Point
."

18:54 -
Lindsey Goheen called: "Reporting a group of
orcas. They are between Point No Point and Norwegian Point
, heading north about mid channel. I believe I see
at least one adult male
, couldn't tell exact number, at least
6-8 individuals
. Sort of in resting pattern. I spotted blows then got binoculars and could see there was a bunch of fins grouped up together. Hopefully someone at your headquarters can hear this and get to see them if they are passing by; they are heading that way right now." -Lindsey Goheen

A bit late, but just read about the request from shoreline residents to report sightings.....A
pod of 5 were headed north by Crystal Springs, Bainbridge Island
, the morning of

Entry 9:
11:30, three returned, headed south more or less, going along the shoreline of
East Bremerton and Illahee State Park
. Soon after passing Illahee State Park, two split off and headed towards Rich Passage. I lost track of the third whale, but according to neighbors they apparently joined up in Rich Passage heading south. The two together appeared to be a juvenile and a mother. They were just frolicking and enjoying the day, moving at moderate speed. They were mostly on the surface, no deep soundings. All photos were from the Point White Pier looking west and then south as they disappeared into Rich Passage. Apologize for the lack of focus on the photos as the whales were no less than Â¾ mile distant at best. -Bob Jaynes

After a minute or two of milling against the rocks below the lighthouse they continued west across Victoria's waterfront. ..." See CWR Encounter #19 for full encounter summary and more photos.

While sitting at the boat launch,
a gray
appeared across the cove on other side,
east of Monroe Landing
. After 10 min. or so, I could see it angling over and somewhat south towards Long Point. This was around
6:45 pm. I then headed to Long Point, best place for sundown too. I walk the beach towards the gray, and then walked with the gray to Long Point. my heart... If only my friends could be with me. That's all I was missing. :-( Anyway, was with

Entry 17:
10:30 -
My wife and I were going for our walk on the
Brownsville
breakwater dock, when, at 1030am, we saw a
solo whale
about 40 yards away. It was not an orca. It wasn't a seal or a sea lion either. It was on the small side but bigger than a sea lion. No obvious dorsal fin. Maybe a small humpback or a Minke? > Brownsville is on the
East side of the Kitsap Peninsula
, facing Fletcher Bay on Bainbridge Island. Maybe we just missed the fin. It was pretty dark/black, heading south toward University Point. Didn't see or hear it blow. Initially, it was only 30-40 yards away. But by the time we figured out what it was and got my phone out, it sounded. When we saw it again, it was about a quarter mile out and south, too far for a phone photo. -DSours
