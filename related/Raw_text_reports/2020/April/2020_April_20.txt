Entry 3:
Port Susan
- WE live on Camano Island. We live on the east side on the southern end. Today we saw our first ever sperm whale. So cool. Sorry no picture. But it was definitely a sperm whale. WE live on a bluff 350 up from the beach. The whale was down in front. Going from the north to the south. Rather slowly. So far this year we have seen more whales than normal. We have seen greys, Orcas (transients) and now a sperm whale. WE watch the greys every year also at least once a year the transient orcas come in. the greys come in with the tide and go out of the bay with the tide. We watch them feed on the other side. Can't see them feed below us. My husband first saw the other whale so I popped up and grabbed my binoculars. It was right in front of our place. I would have thought it was a grey whale by its colour but it took its head right out of the water. That is what floored me. Its head was rectangular in the forehead. IT came up more than once and I got a really good look at it. It had a big square nose. Not at all like a grey. Not even a sick one. It did look like a younger whale but that is just what we think. But definitely not a grey or an orca. I even looked it up on the internet to see if I was right and it was just what we saw. I also looked up videos of them swimming to make sure it is what we saw. It was. But that nose is pretty hard to mix up with other whales. Tom and I have noted that we have more whales this year. We had one go through yesterday. Probably a grey. WE could not see it well as it was too close so the trees get in the way. But with this pandemic we have noted that there are hardly any boats on the bay... WE have been watching the grey whales now for 13 years from our place and I can tell you for sure it was NOT a grey whale. You know we had 3 grey in here a few weeks ago one about 45 feet long one a bit smaller and what we thought was a baby as it was much smaller. They hung out front long enough for us to go out to our point and look over the edge. You could see the barnacles on it and I could see its eye with no binoculars. So we do know what a grey whale looks like. It was not a grey whale. I know it is hard to believe but it is what it is. I am just really pleased that I was privileged to see it. BTW we are almost at the southern tip of Camano. So this whale was not very far into Port Susan sound. He was also going south out of the sound. Our side of the sound is deeper than the other side. I hope this helps. -Terri and Tom Smith
