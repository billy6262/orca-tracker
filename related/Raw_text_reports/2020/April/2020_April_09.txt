. -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound/Carr Inlet (T46Bs & T46D) -

15:30 -
We located whales near
Penrose State Park/Purdy
last Thursday 4/9/20 at
3:30pm. We saw one breach. And couldn't tell for certain how many there were, but we estimate 5. There appeared to be 3 that were swimming together, followed by a larger whale. And a very large whale further behind them. I hope this is helpful! -Beccy Scheuffele
*

14:30 - They [T46Bs]
came by, heading out of the bay - it looked like all of the orcas that I had seen this morning. They must have found some good hunting around Purdy to have stayed up there for 6 hours! Also, we did see a couple of harbor seals along the shore, which also surprised me, given that the orcas were around. -Tim Hoffnagle
*

Entry 3:
North Puget Sound -

09:45 - Three or more orcas with at least one male, northbound, off of the Edmonds ferry terminal
. They were staying down a long time and I lost track of them after they passed the Edmonds ferry terminal, but if they maintained their heading, it would be [toward] Mukilteo. -Sherman Page
*

09:49 -
Brad Coombe, WSF Marine Ops, emailed: SPOKANE Master reports
three orca traveling northbound, one mile off of EDM [Edmonds]. Heading northwest
. May be making a dash for Possession Sound.

Entry 4:
South Puget Sound/Carr Inlet -

18:30 -
Wow! This must be my day for seeing wildlife. Earlier this evening, I saw a river otter swimming along the shore and then, at
18:30, that same group of orcas passed my house on
Henderson Bay
, this time slowly heading south. I saw at least one adult male and a total of
maybe 6-10 orcas, including Tl'uk
. -Timothy Hoffnagle
*

18:30 -
Spotted blows of
multiple orcas around
6:30pm this evening on the Kitsap side
. At the time, they appeared
heading into Henderson Bay
near Lakebay area as viewed from Gig Harbor side. But then I believe they turned back & I lost sight of them. -Anika Blake
*

16:40 - Between Cutts Island and Home
...they were headed north toward Purdy. Out of sight now.

16:21 - A white orca with about 7 other orcas in Carr Inlet
right now. -Samuel Hilbert

10:25 -
Just had what I believe were
a pod of Orcas
, including possibly a white young Orca, swim by my home in the
Carr Inlet
about an hour and half ago. I live on 115th Ave Nw, Gig Harbor for reference. I was so excited I'm afraid the quality isn't amazing but got a few pretty decent ones to share! ...Thank you so much for getting back so quickly- and with all that info, so exciting!! It was
10:25am to be exact (that's when I called my husband to run out to see them!!) and they were going southbound as you guessed! Best wishes, Jennifer Swenson

Getting neighbors calling saying
a pod of orcas are in Henderson Bay
as of 10am, unfortunately I wasn't home to get the message until now. -Sarah Feagin Anderson
*

17:32 -
FYI the
orca are still in in Henderson Bay
hunting, the same group as this morning. Unfortunately too far out to get pictures. Staying in one place hunting. There is a small boat out there so far being respectful. One big guy a distance away.

09:10 -
Spoke with Terry,
the orcas in Henderson Bay do include the pale/white whale (so T46B1s present at least)
and are still in the middle of the bay in same general area as last reported. Some added observations to earlier reports: she did see a lot of surface activity, some spyhops.

09:05 -
Yes, we saw the white whale. They were all spread out. Last I saw them there were at least 5 and a bigger fin showed up way in the distance where I sent the location. We have a lot of harbor porpoise in the bay right now.

07:56 - Orca still in Henderson Bay
, seem to be feeding. Right about here: (47.3255096, -122.7060990). I am looking thru binoculars from my house.

07:00 -
Saw
orcas in Henderson Bay
around
7:00 am. Looks like same pod from yesterday. Looked to be hunting in this area (47.3613563, -122.6719800) Kayaker was right in the middle of them. They started moving toward Cutts Island. Kayaker still with them at
7:30 am. If Kayaker has a camera on him he will have very close pictures. They seem to be circling in one place now. They are not leaving the area as of right now. -Terry Shovlowsky

09:15 -
I live in Carr Inlet. This morning between

8:30 -
9:15, there was
a group of orcas, perhaps 6 or seven playing towards the east shore of Henderson Bay
. We are on the west shore, but with my Sigma 600mm lens I was still able to capture some images--surely you might be able to identify the whales -
T46Bs
. Thanks much for the great work you do! I will keep a lookout this afternoon. Best regards, Ingrid Shumway

I was out kayaking on
Henderson Bay
this morning and saw that group of transient orcas again. There were
maybe 10-15 of them, including the white juvenile
, but it was hard to estimate the numbers, as they were pretty well spread out. At times, they appeared to be hunting (some fast swimming and quick turns) and I thought that maybe they were chasing some harbor porpoises up the bay. I first saw them at about
06:30, as they were moving up the bay and I followed them (from a distance) until
they turned around about halfway between Minter Creek and Purdy Spit
. They were leaving the bay when I left them at about
07:30. One other note is that the tip of the dorsal fin of one of the adult males (I think that there were two) was bent (to the right, I believe). photos (
T46B1B and T46B2+
). -Timothy Hoffnagle

Mike Haschak (sp?) called at
10 am
to report watching a
gray whale
today,
April 9th between 7-
7:45, just off the salmon farm
east of Skagit Island
or Hope Island in Skagit Bay/Similk Bay. Whale seemed to be lingering, possibly feeding and wasn't going in any particular direction. There was a gray whale there yesterday (8th), north of Skagit Island, a single whale. Also 2 days before that (6th) a gray whale. Possibly same whale all 3 days?
