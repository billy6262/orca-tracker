============================================================

Entry 1:
NW Strait of Georgia (south of Cape Mudge/Quadra Island)
- I went out to confirm the presence of
J Pod
in the upper Salish Sea. The lighting was magical and for the few of us that managed to get out on the water last night, it was a real treat to see. -Nick Templeman, Campbell River

2 orca off Sidney BC
. About midway in the channel, heading northbound. One bull with a nick in the trailing edge of dorsal, about 1/3 of the way down. Second whale is smaller. Watching from land so can't give better descriptions than that. -Mari Wood

Wow, what a surprise. Just on my way back from a brief hike at Sucia, nearly home, and I heard the sound of the whale spout above my boat engine. I stayed watching for about 30 minutes between

4:30-5. I was in about 50 feet of water. See my map. I'm the X. The arrows are approximately where I saw the whale and what direction. As I'm not familiar enough with terms or behavior so that's about all the info I can pass on. [Eric's map indicates location just of
Cherry Point Aquatic Reserve, south of Birch Bay

"That is
not a known whale for the Sound
. I will let you know if it is found once it goes through a full catalog search. Thanks for the photos and sighting info." -Alie (Perez), Cascadia Research Collective

Entry 4:
15:39 -
Darrell Martin called to report tracking
2 adult gray whales, south side of Country Club on Camano Island
in northern end of Port Susan Bay. When he first saw them, whales were feeding, then they moved further offshore and started traveling. Tracked them to Driftwood Shores, they ended up very close to shore. Kayakers came out to greet them, then the whales disappeared. He caught sight of the grays again just off the Country Club, very close to shore, initially 1/2 mile then went as far as 1 mile all the way to Driftwood.

passed near shore, north to south, deep dives. Research boat was monitoring. Too far for a good iPhone pic, Alice has been alerted. Hopefully pics to follow! -Lori Christopher

Entry 6:
12:40 -
Hello, we spotted whales spouting off the
Wonn Road beach access in Greenbank
at
12:40 pm today, the 15th. We did not observe any large dorsal fins and they were likely grey whales. My
guess is that there were three
, but they did not all surface at the same time, so hard to say. They were slowly moving north - northeast, moving out of Holmes Harbor towards Saratoga Passage. They were near mid-channel between us and Baby Island. We observed them looking east - southeast. They were coming up for air and may have been feeding at the time, as they were down for several minutes. -Regards, John Heal

07:48 -
There may be
2 grays
. I had been sitting here for about an hr. just getting ready to leave. Anyway, pretty sure there are 2 of them, and now in line with Mabana Shores and further out, mid channel heading southbound.

07:40 -
Good morning, a
gray whale a bit out from Fox Spit
appears to be traveling southbound. I will keep my eye on her/him. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 7:
11:00 - 2 grays feeding in Crescent Harbor
. -Suzanne Sewester

Entry 8:
7:00 and
7:15 this AM we observed 2-3 Harbor Porpoise just North of the Dive Park
. This is not a usual sighting for us. What a delight. We tried to get pictures but only had cell phones. I'll send any if they turn out. On the same walk there were 3-4 California Sea Lions quite active, closer to the Ferry in close at Brackett's Landing. We've been hearing their barks for the past few days 1-2 blocks away so it was nice to see them this morning. Stay Safe and Well, Kendall and Brian Berry
