Orca Sightings for April 5, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia
- Enjoy these as the #chiefwhalespotter and I did, as it was a much needed encounter and a breather from days that have felt like weeks. There was some foraging at the Hump and as they crossed the Willaby Shoals area of
Cape Mudge
. Then back south they went, next stop Kitty Coleman, I thought, then a friend from that way messaged earlier......she was listening to blows in the dark off her beach house, awesome.

by now and way over on the Whidbey side.

12:30-

13:30 -
At least 8 animals and also definitely saw T46D. (We were in our boat). Stayed quite distant from them so unclear on exact numbers. We found them
off Polnell
around
12:30 pm, they briefly went into Crescent Harbor and then headed back south again. (I heard later that they'd been between Polnell and N Camano for about 90 minutes before we'd found them, don't know if they hunted successfully though.). Last I heard the whales were in the
vicinity of Fox Spit
. This group definitely knows how to "disappear" - even on dead calm days! They were definitely in traveling/hunting mode - zig-zagging a bit southbound - we left them approx. by Harrington Lagoon and they were closer to Whidbey. We left them at
1:30 and tried to find some gray whales, but unsuccessful.

10:45am. -David Berg
