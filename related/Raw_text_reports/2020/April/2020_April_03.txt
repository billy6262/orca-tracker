Sun,

Entry 2:
- ...the day before that [
April 2nd], we saw
grey whales
. WE have seen several greys this year. They came in much later than normal. I do not know the days. If I had known someone was interested, I would have written it down, but the first sighting was of 3 greys. One about 45' long, one medium sized one, and one that I felt looked like a baby. They went
up Port Susan Sound
on the East side and then came back along the Camano side. They were so close you could see the barnacles on them without binoculars. Sorry no pictures of them. WE ran out to our point and looked over the edge and watch and listened to them go by. The next grey to come along a day or two later was not as big as the really large one we saw. I remembered I sent an email to an out-of-town neighbor so I checked the date. The greys came in the first time on
March 29th. BTW, we live on Camano Island, east side on the south end. WE are on a 350' bluff with a 180-degree view of the water. -Terri Smith

Got to see that
group north of Langley
just now since I was working down at the Whale Center! They're still heading north probably will be coming on bells Beach before too long. Could see a large male. All I can add is that they did seem to be moving pretty quickly North, mid channel. -Katie Watkins, Orca Network
