Orca Sightings for April 14, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Central Puget Sound (T46Bs and T46D)
- ~

09:00 - Hi, I'm emailing to give you some information on an Orca sighting my friend and I had this morning. We were birding at
West Point in Discovery Park
this morning, when we picked up a pod of
Orcas
fairly distant in the channel at about 9am, directly West, straight off the point. I think they were closer to Discovery than Bainbridge, but not far from mid channel. We watched them for around 15 minutes, and I got poor quality iPhone videos through the scope, which I can send you, but unfortunately even a single video exceeds the storage allowed in email. We were particularly amazed to find a
white whale
! It was a smaller sized Orca among the others. I looked it up and I think it may have been seen last year, perhaps named Tl'uk? Or this could be a different whale. Hopefully you can ID it from the bad videos. I have heard of white orcas before, but I understand they are quite rare. I believe the pod was transients, because I didn't see any saddle patches, but I'm not sure and I'd be curious to hear any information you may have of the white whale and its pod. The distance made it hard to see the patches well enough. The adult male had quite a tall dorsal fin, and I'm not entirely sure if this indicates resident or transient. It was bent slightly towards the tail at the top. There was one adult male, at least one younger male, and I believe seven female or youngsters, though I'm not certain about that number. I was sure that the pod had at least seven individuals. There was lots of partial breaching and tail/dorsal fin slapping, and a few times they raised their tail vertically in the air, as seen on one of the videos. I'd never heard they did that. They didn't move very much while we watched, but when I left them, they were slowly heading North. I'd like to get the videos to you so I hope there's a way to do that. Please let me know if you have any questions or info on the pod. I hope this helps! -Louis Kreemer, Seattle

Hello-We sighted
a pod of orcas this morning (4.14.20) from our home in Oceanside, Oregon
at approximately
9:15am. Unfortunately, we were unable to get any quality photos or videos. Using binoculars, I was able to spot approximately 4-5 Orcas in the pod. I could be wrong but I thought I saw a calf. They were very close to shore. 100 yards west of the surf zone. They were moving southward but at times doubled back. The video of the splashes was a long way off. Were they feeding? -Todd Schwartz

Entry 5:
12:00 - My girlfriend and I saw
a humpback, possibly a pair, 100 yards off the mouth of the Dosewallips River in Dabob Bay
. They were heading southeast down the bay toward Pleasant Harbor. We saw them on 04/14/2020 around 1200 hours. For sure there was one. We saw the back come out of the water with its distinct dorsal fin. They were moving very quickly. After that all we saw was just the mist from the blows until it disappeared into the distance. -Walter Olson

Entry 6:
15:35 - Photographed from shore. Observed near the north edge of
Hannah Hts. at
3:45 pm, 2 Humpbacks
very far out. The pair was traveling slowly to the west, away from the island. The pair, one with a blunted fin and one with a pointed, curved fin, surfaced many times. I saw the curved fin's tail once, but it was so far out it just looked dark. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 7:

Tue, Apr 14 - Skagit Bay - "Spouting News" BLUE RIBBON AWARDS go out yesterday off Mariners' Cove in banner year for grays.
One gray slowly meandered and fed for nearly 3 hours near shoreline
on high tide. Saw mid channel spouts then huge whale fluke out of the water dive with next resurfacing; close in steaming to join the feeding gray. Feeding side by side for a bit.
Another whale spouting mid channel
, totaling 3 grays in area. Doesn't get much better in diamond clad waters on gorgeous sunny warm spring day morning. -Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor, WA

, in front of Skagit Island. Pictures taken from the shore. 2020-04-14 between 3 and 5pm. Thanks! -Kee Hinckley

They're back! Gray whales in Skagit Bay. They (two I believe now) were here close last night [14th], hanging out in the current, pinched
between Hope Island and the reef off of Lone Tree Point
. Right now, they're circling from there down between the fish farm, Hope Island and Skagit Island. Pictures and videos of the whales in our bay between
April 6th and today (the 15th). There was only one day we didn't see them (Monday the 13th). We're catching them on my "big lens" from a distance, but here and there, they'll pop up close and startle/amaze us. Luckily there aren't many boats on the water here, so it's been a pretty mellow scene with people out there getting some views and pictures from a safe distance. -Todd Cowles

There are
at least 3, maybe 4, gray whales west of Jetty Island

We can see blows and occasional fins with a good set of binoculars from the south shore. Two whales have been exposing fins above the water imitating orca. They were there last evening as well. -Greg Heiss
