============================================================

Entry 1:
12:55 -
Hi! We just saw this
whale off McKees Beach in Stanwood
. He came from the south traveling north. Very close to shore. He came up multiple times and showed us his tail! He was alone. We have seen the whales almost daily, but this was so close! I hope you can see these videos. -Thanks! Gena Schirer

Entry 2:
09:14 - Just saw two [grays]
right off the shore on the East side of Whidbey -
between Harrington and Race Lagoons
. They fed for about 25 minutes in the same spot, occasionally breaching. They have now headed south towards Greenbank. -Leroy Rothe

This morning shortly after 9AM we became aware of
2-3 grays
off our beach. Around 930 they started heading south. The estuary from
Race Lagoon
is in front of our place and we are thinking that it is rich with food for the whales. -Brenda Kidd

08:30 -
I heard one in front of my house about
8:30 and managed to get a few pics (very few worthwhile for ID) but will try to ID who it was - there may have been 2 but hard to say. And 'they' did feed between our house and
Race Lagoon
for about 25 minutes, never seen any feeding up in this area before so that's very cool. When 'they' left I went to Shangri-La and spotted one whale passing to the south, and next time I saw it was heading towards Camano in the direction of Onamac - at least half a mile east. A sweet breakfast treat. I've gone through my limited "new whale" pics and don't find this one - there "may" have been 2 whales but I see no evidence of 2 in the photos. -Jill Hein - photos by Jill Hein -

Entry 5:
18:30 - Single Grey whale
breach at about
6:30 p.m., heading north about 1-200 yards off Wilkinson Rd., Langley, tonight. -Sincerely, Craig Weiner, DC

07:00 -
We saw
whales this morning near Langley
from a distance. All we really saw was the back and the water shoot from the spout. Hope to see more soon...! -David (dad) and Elliott (4.5 years old)

Entry 6:
one gray whale
coming up
between Hat Island and Whidbey Island
in Saratoga Passage, moving up the passage heading northwest. He said there was a kayaker out there so hoping some photos might surface. He also reports the whale actually breached. He did not see the breach but many of his neighbors are talking about it.

Northern Saratoga Passage -

10:36 - Sighting from Onamac Point
, Camano Island: One gray whale that surfaced about 100 yards off shore twice (that I saw) and then not sure where he went. Maybe 4 minutes between surfacing.
