17:30
(approx.) - Watched
a pod of orcas in Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey Island, near Greenbank. There appeared to be a juvenile, as well. At least six in the pod? -Kristen Coombe
*

17:30 - Large pod of orcas
today (about a dozen) sited while Kayaking in
Saratoga passage
. Saw them at
5:30 pm
between Baby Island and Greenbank
at the mouth of Holmes Harbor. Amazing. -Randy Geller

17:20 -
Hello! Just spotted
a pod of at least four orcas off our porch in Holmes Harbor
, Greenbank, WA. -Emily Cheung
*
Bob Miller of Freeland, Whidbey called to report seeing
pod of orcas
on
April 7, deep in
Holmes Harbor
. Larger one was further off, other 3 together, little white whale was between. Their neighbors were on the dock when the whales came close in to the dock. They watched from their perch (down by the golf course) with binoculars. They were outside prepping to BBQ when they heard the woosh sound of their exhalations.
*

17:15-

18:00 - Two groups of orcas in Holmes Harbor
. One group off Dines Pt. The other off Saratoga Beach, mid harbor. At approx.
5:30 the two mostly joined up. Looked like seven, with two large males, two females and three youngsters. Were a number of small boats that came on scene, and one cut the group off twice and was way too close. Three kayakers came and got quite a show. At
6:00pm they were off Greenbank headed north. Lots of surface action and they changed direction multiple times. Breaching, tail slaps, you name it. Water was extremely calm. What a treat. -Dan Gulden
*

17:06 -
We've been watching
6-7 Orcas
from the east side. They were on the west side, golf club going north. Near Honeymoon Bay when we came in. [Holmes Harbor]. -Jennifer Abermanis
*

19:00 -
I've counted
about 8 orcas
now, looking like committed to northbound from my vantage point. They appear to be
north of Hidden Beach
, but most likely out from Hidden Beach. Dorsal fins aiming due north and closer to Greenback side. Beautiful evening.

17:25 -
The south group is nearing
Dines Point now (northbound)
, and this group is stalled out mid channel. They may have split off earlier. Just a guess. Beautiful back lit blows right now.

17:15 -
This group of orcas has slowed down and just about
1/2 mile south of Baby Island into Holmes Harbor
.

17:05 -
My neighbor just texted me, and
group of orcas heading into Holmes Harbor (from Baby Island area)
, booking it. I see them, they are heading southbound, mid channel. This has to be another group.

18:00 -
(approx.) At least 5, maybe up to 8 orcas,
including a small grey/white one, headed south into Holmes Harbor
, and then back out of the harbor north into Saratoga Passage. -Martha Sinclair

So happy to meet the little white Transient orca Tl'uk when the
T46Bs, T46B1B "Tl'uk" doing a headstand
were in Holmes Harbor on

Entry 4:
*

16:30 -T46Bs in Holmes Harbor
I just can't even!!!!! There were at least 8 orcas including the albino baby and they were swimming under the dock! -Darci Shultz
*

16:27 -
Had such a special day (social distancing was practiced) and saw some behaviors I've never seen before. At one point, they made a huge wave underwater while going after a sea lion. It was so cool, the people that lived up on the bluff were all cheering. It was fun to hear the cheers among the whales breathing.

"This was taken sometime between
6:30 and 7 pm, from Hidden Beach." -Dori Dace
*

16:00 (approx.) - T46Bs in Holmes Harbor.
The T46Bs hunting under and near the dock where she and others were standing:
T46B1B "Tl'uk", T46B2, T46B2

Life does still have some pleasant surprises, with a visit from
T46B1B, or Tl'uk
, a Coast Salish word for 'moon', and family. It's not too often that we see orcas from the bottom of our garden, so to speak, but we were indeed blessed today. There was also the added bonus of 'socially distanced' friends enjoying the view too. Taking no prisoners... Jaw-dropping moments as
April 7 visiting transient orcas, including the little white orca T046B1B (Tl'uk), exhibit their wild, raw lifestyle as the ocean's top predators, leaving no doubt as to their unrivaled agility and power. Before hitting the dock in Holmes Harbor, where they were attempting to flush out seals, the orcas took a large raft of seabirds by surprise just off Hidden Beach, Whidbey, scattering them to the skies. Food was aplenty, with many sea-lions, seals and harbor porpoise clustered together - safety in numbers maybe. -Sandra Pollard

10:30 - Definitely T46Bs
- still southbound, but milling off Race Lagoon now. Tl'uk seen. Ok so I started off to find
a gray whale in Penn Cove
this morning - didn't quite get that far as orcas were seen east of Penn Cove, in Saratoga Passage. I headed to Long Point instead. Followed them to Harrington where they were fairly close, to my house, again probably about 500 yards out, and they continued south. Off to Shangri-La Shores and got there just in time (Clarence was directing me from home, saying they were INSIDE the mooring buoys as they headed south), and there they were - mostly inside the mooring buoys. A few people were out on the pier, well distanced, and the whales came right to us. Just sending 3 pics for now but have many many more - later? Tl'uk was in the close group of about 4 or 5, others were further out, including T46D. Then headed to Hidden Beach but after waiting a long time, they were still a good way to the north on the Camano side. So I came home. Couldn't beat that close pass-by.

16:00 - Orcas are nearing Freeland Park
, near the golf course and Beachside Grill, with some still out from there.

...I see them directly across (from my neighborhood on east side Holmes Harbor) due west and on Greenback side of mid channel. They are nearing Dines Point southbound.

12:30 -
Viewing from
Hidden Beach
. Orcas are mid channel across from Indian Beach, Camano. They've been pokey. A few closer to Whidbey side.

11:00 - At least 8 orcas out here
, now south of Shangri-La. (back of cam image

Harrington Lagoon, still heading southbound

10:30 - They headed south
around
10:30am.

09:33 -
I'm still seeing them. They are just SE of the green buoy that marks
Snakelum Pt
. It looks like they may have a second kill judging by the birds in the air.

09:23 -
Update, approximate location and it looks like they are on a kill. [Erik's map indicates that they are
in Saratoga, parallel to Penn Cove
-gs]

09:05 -
Update. They are now just off, north of the Green Buoy milling around.

09:00 -
Update (3) orcas now
heading NE toward Oak Harbor

. Heading north towards Cama Beach Park. -Anna Terranova Bonadies - CWW

07:25 - The two grays are slowly heading southbound towards Bells Beach
, feeding along the shore.

06:30 - There are 2 grays feeding at Fox Spit
, Whidbey. They are right along the south shore aimed at Bells Beach. Morning coffee with 2 beautiful grays

6:30-7ish am... Amazing sweet tranquil morning sounds. The swishing and blows and swirlings of the waters. There is nothing like it. -Marilyn Armbruster
