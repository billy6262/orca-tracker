15:45 - We saw four whales

south end of Hat

3:45, milling, moving south and east. Too far for pics. -Lori Christopher

12:28 - Three grays reported off the southeast side of Hat Island
. Today looks like a nice day to sit in a boat and watch them feed. They are in the "usual spot" [west of Jetty Island, near Everett]. We are fortunate enough to be able to watch them from our dinner table with a good set of binoculars. -Greg Heiss

09:30 -
Wendy Wilson called to report
a whale

Entry 6:
09:30 am right off of
Hat Island
, on the east shore of Hat Island in Possession Sound, think just one whale. He showed his tail at least 10 times. Assuming a gray. Never seen a gray show his tail that much. All within 10 minutes.
