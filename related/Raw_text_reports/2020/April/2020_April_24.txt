Orca Sightings for April 24, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T097, T124C)
- Center for Whale Research Encounter #24: "
a mile north west of Seabird Point, Discovery Island
... He immediately recognized T124C as the smaller bull and upon getting a closer look at them could see that his sidekick was T097, a bull that he had seen last
December 16 without T093 who was previously inseparable with. ..." See CWR Encounter #24 for full encounter summary and more photos.

Entry 2:
13:48 -
Just saw a pod of
orcas off Moclips
, Washington coast!
Big male dorsal. Looked like one or two others. Northbound
. Too far to get pics. Really took me awhile of staring at them but it looks like they were in close proximity to gray whales. But tall black dorsal fin and several small other smaller black dorsal fins. -Alexander Simenstad

(T49As) -

16:00 - At least 3 orcas off Gordan Beach

April 24th, 2020. They were pretty close to shore! (video from my boyfriend's family who live at Otter Point.) -Clairey Moze

Orca hunting seals off Possession Point
, 5 minutes from our docks. I headed out to sea who we had...The
T049As
(minus a couple) were heading east past
East Sooke
, with long dives very close to shore then pop up almost anywhere...it was great to document these Transient Killer whales in these uncertain times....Stay Well! -Paul Pudwell

Entry 5:

18:00 - Two grays feeding and blowing in Langley
off Wilkinson Road between the mainland and the southern tip of Camino... Amazing it's 6 PM and they don't seem to be going anywhere. Amazing rolling and feeding, and one went towards Camano and the other right off our beach. -Craig Weiner

This happy hour gray was really happy. He breached a short distance up the beach from us, shooting his body out of the water, then a pectoral, then turned and flopped into the water on his belly. Such a sight! He/she looked like an ancient tree stump rising out of the water. By the time I retrieved my camera, he had traveled around the south side of the beach, so my photos are blurry. But a little guillemot shared the lens with him. Exciting! -Peg Boley, Pebble Beach

Entry 8:
Hood Canal-
medium sized whale, mid channel in front of Hoodsport, traveling South alone.
Looked like a grey whale
but was only surfacing to breathe so didn't get a great look at it. Hope this can help with the whale tracking! -Audrey Lambert

14:30-

14:45 -
Location:
Hood Canal. Mid-Channel. Between Glen Ayre Resort and Hoodsport WA
. While standing on our beach, my family (in self isolation) observed a whale that we believe was a medium sized
Grey Whale
. A positive ID was not confirmed (but we don't believe it was a humpback and I used to work on whale watching boats in Southern California and I am about 90% sure this was a Grey). It was about 3/4 of a mile distant and not rising very high when it surfaced. It was not an orca, porpoise or dolphin. It was mid Channel heading fairly slowly South towards Annas Bay (the Great Bend of Hood Canal). It was surfacing to breathe about every three minutes and not diving deeply. It was surfacing about 100 yards from its previously sighted locations as it headed south when it was surfacing. Last seen headed south at
2:45 pm directly off Hoodsport WA, mid channel. -Brad Lambert, Cougar Spit, Hood Canal

Entry 9:
Possession Sound -

07:00-

08:00 - #531
. We watched her yesterday morning off of south Whidbey. She appeared to be feeding, rolling on her side in the shallows, and thrashing with her tail. This lasted for over an hour 7-8am yesterday off of Brighton Beach. Thanks for confirming!! photo by Armour -
