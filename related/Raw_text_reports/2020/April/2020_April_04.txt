Saratoga Passage (T46Bs) -

19:32 - [orca]
Yes, they just passed my view into the direct sunset from where I am on
Eagle Crest
, southbound towards Onamac at
7:30pm. Definitively hunting. Way, way over on the Whidbey side. Not sure if any of my photos are worth it. -Kristina Trowbridg - CWW
*

19:47 - Orcas feeding, Whidbey side across from Onomac Point area!

19:29 -
I am watching them feed light crazy right now. Look on Whidbey side near Penn Cove if you want to see a show! We could see Salmon jumping in Front of them! Truly amazing!!!

19:13 -
We see them too with our scope! Heading towards Whidbey,
going in to Penn Cove
. -John Barry - CWW
*

19:02 -
They are very close to Whidbey and moving fast. From our vantage point, way south of the sun.

18:46 - Orcas at entrance to Penn Cove
, heading south. Seeing from Sunset/Madrona with binoculars. -Nedra Wilson - CWW
*

16:01 - [orca]
They headed north, closer to Whidbey but possibly more out from
Madrona Beach
by now. -Quinn Johnson - CWW
*

15:38 -
Just watched a group of
Orcas from Hidden Beach
this afternoon. We watched them from the shore for about 30 min. Think there was
4-5 of them
. Lots of seals, porpoises, and bird activity too. Beautiful day. -Tammy Evans
*

16:03 - They went north towards Oak Harbor.

14:57 - Orcas playing in front of Onamac Beach
right now. Heading toward Whidbey. -Tricia Camp Barry - CWW
*

12:40-
13:25
(approx.) - Today, a group of
at least 6 Orcas
, including one that seemed to be completely white.
Feeding off the point at Fox Spit
(also called Eastpoint). My neighbor took a short video from down on the beach (whereas I was watching from up above for a good 40+ minutes). She wasn't able to make out
the white one
from her angle, but through binoculars, it was very clear to me. She sent me her video. Though she hadn't seen the white Orca with her eyes, I was able to point it out to her in her video. So we have video of the white one right here off Fox Spit. They stayed feeding right here at the point for over 40 minutes. Then they slowly started moving "up" Saratoga Passage, but that's actually kind of west where I saw them heading. So they could have turned north to continue along Saratoga Passage or they could have gone further west and then turned south into Holmes Harbor. I don't know which, as I lost sight of them soon after they started moving away. -Christine Kelly
*

11:00
(approx.) -
Five orcas headed north between Langley and south Camano
around 11 this morning, breaching and splashing. The
white juvenile
was with them. They picked up speed and continued north. -Peg Boley - CWW

Entry 3:
11:00 -
Bill Watson called from
Yachats, OR

3 killer whales
(one male) presumes probably more he didn't see. Orcas were couple hundred yards offshore heading south. No breaching. There are a lot of other whales in the area right now. Sighting was at about 11am.

Hi! Just saw a group of at least
2-3 whales moving north right off our house in Mukilteo
. I saw 3 spouts, my husband thought he saw more. Grays, maybe? Def not orcas; no dorsal sighted. They've moved behind trees now and are under water, so I can't get any pix, but hope that is useful info! -Hilary Exon Hager

Fri, Apr 3 and Sat, Apr 4 - Port Susan - My daughter sent me an email that you were interested in the whales that people are seeing. We have been watching the whales. We had the
transient orcas in on
April 4th at about
9:30 am
. First they were seen coming south towards us fairly rapidly, then they stopped and hunted seals in front of our place.
They were here the day before that too, so

Entry 7:
11:00-

14:45 -
I live in
Grapeview
on the water, facing southeast. Yesterday, there were large groups of sea lions and what I think were harbor porpoises out front all day. The porpoises were leaping out of the water, which is odd behavior for them. This went on for at least 5 hours. I have several decent photos if you would like me to get them to you. I am wondering if I have mis-identified the porpoises. -Cammy LaRivier

These appear to be the

15:00 -
My mother, Mikel O'Brien, was kayaking in
Pickering Passage
today at around
3:00 P.M. when she took these photos of
2 common dolphins
swimming and playing around a raft of California sea lions west of the
northern point of Harstine Island
. -Conor O'Brien
