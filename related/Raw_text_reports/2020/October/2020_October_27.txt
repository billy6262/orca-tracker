Will Rodman, professional sailboat captain in Puget Sound, called to report they just sighted who appears to be
two humpback whales, one juvenile humpback and one large
. They were about 1/2 mile west of off Meadow Point,
Shilshole Marina
. Going slow non-directional, diving. Fairly certain 2 humpbacks due to white coloring underneath. [
Orca Network has had reports of humpback in that area both Sunday and Monday-alb
]

Entry 2:
Haro Strait -

10:24 - Humpback southbound 1/4 mile south of Edwards Point
. Surfacing quickly multiple times, the humpback took a deep dive and I didn't see it again. It was approximately 400 yards from my position on shore. Using the MERS Catalogue I believe this is
BCX1358 (M) Frankenstein
. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Possible humpback off
Jefferson Beach
, Kitsap side. about
3:15pm, heading south, slowly. -Joanne Graves

Thinking now you likely saw a
gray whale
. Someone reported gray whale and sent fluke photo which confirms gray (who I'm pretty certain is 2020
newbie 2261
) off Point Jefferson at
15:00 on the 27th. So we had gray out there while those humpbacks were swimming around, as well! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 6:
14:24 -
Tim Taylor called to report a whale while sailing and posted it in South Sound Sailing and was encouraged to report to Orca Network. They had just left
West Bay Marina, Budd Inlet
, Olympia, and were near marker 5, when they first saw animal roll, then saw tall blow ~10ft. Whale came up again then went on a dive. They kept 500 feet distance so weren't able to get any photos with their phone. The whale headed deeper into the inlet towards Bay Thiftway by Capitol Lake, at the time. First time seeing a whale in the wild!

Gray in Pickering Passage
this morning for several hours. -Gretchen Stewart

09:24 -
I'm at Latimer's Landing in
Pickering Pass
and a small humpback whale passed by, moving south under the bridge. Followup: I had to look at Gray whale pics and yes indeed, I agree -
Gray
! I didn't realize that they also had tiny dorsal fins. This probably isn't helpful but it's all I have. It went right by our dead boat. This is all I got. Unlike the humpbacks I've seen, this whale never showed its fluke on any dives. Thank you for the info. -Nick Wenzel
