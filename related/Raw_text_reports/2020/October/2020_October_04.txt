Entry 1:
(J pod) -
Getting to see wee baby orcas in the sea where they belong is an honor and a blessing. Through all of the hard times these orcas have been through, they still try to keep family their priority.
Tahlequah (J35)
finally has her second baby, as does
Eclipse (J41)
. Here's to them and salmon to keep them healthy and strong. -April Ryan, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

The leaders were sighted
southbound at Edwards Pt. 15-17 J-Pod members
spread out, a few breaches, mostly milling and traveling slowly in a few groups of 2-3.
J39 Mako
who was observed with 3 scratches far down on his left saddle patch,
J49 T'ilem I'nges, J16 Slick, J42 Echo with J40 Suttles, J47 Notch
and then happily I could just make out his mom
J35 Tahlequah and her new calf J57
. The three traveled tight together with the calf between them. Bringing up the rear, J26 Mike. As is his habit he circled, concentrating on his fishing in a spot he often favors. To watch his movements is like watching a dancer practicing. For 25 minutes he hunted gracefully moving south.

11:40 - Clicking and calls heard on LK hydrophone

During Encounter #54, CWR had the opportunity to photograph
J41 with her new calf
. This was the first time we had seen the calf and officially designated this latest
member of J Pod as J58
. During our Encounter, both
J41 and J51
were chasing fish and J58 was right there in the middle of the action. [See Center for Whale Research Encounter #54 for full encounter summary and more photos] https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-54
