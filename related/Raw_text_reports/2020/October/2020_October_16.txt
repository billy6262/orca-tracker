East side group has male, female/calf. Baby was breaching over here. Long down times and chop making difficult to see most all of who is out here. I'd say they are Residents, but can't confirm yet. Still steady southbound southern end Richmond Beach and across in groups 1-4s.

I am hearing
orca calls on Bush Point [hydrophone]
this morning. They started before 5 a.m., very faint. They are getting louder at
5:20.
Follow-up email: Not sure which type. I starting hearing them around
4:50am but they were very faint. I wanted to be sure it was orca calls and the calls got louder at
5:15am so I sent you an email. The calls stopped around
5:30. Best music to wake up to!!! It was the first time in a few days that I had Bush Point on. I've been listening to Lime Kiln. -Linda Aitkins

Entry 3:

18:00 - ...juvenile humpback in Case Inlet
, north of Heron Island, traveling south in between Heron Island and Key Peninsula (Lakebay). This was at around 6pm on the 16th. It had the white markings on the tail (I'm not sure if that is a unique trait). There was lots of exhalation/blow, frolicking and tail slapping on the surface of the water. There was a small dorsal hump. -Katie Horkey Currier
*

16:55 -
We saw it just north of
Heron Island (Case Inlet)
, travelling south toward Olympia. It put on quite a show; lots of breaching, tail slaps. I couldn't tell if it was a small humpback or gray whale, but during its final dive it did look like a small humpback. Added: Or, perhaps it was a minke whale now that I look at pictures of them. -Mary Beth Peterson
[
â€¦from distant video and from others' reports, it looks and sounds to be a juvenile
humpback
. -alb

16:41 -
There is something large splashing around in
Case Inlet just north of Herron Island
. I don't see any tall fin on its back, and it just seems to be one. I don't know my whales very well. But so fun seeing it splash around and breaching. -LO Monaghan

09:05 -
Jonathan Farney called to report a whale, not orca, much larger. They live just north of
Tolmie SP
. The whale sighted was large, traveling on the East side of
Johnson Point, Olympia
, in about 70-100 feet of water, headed north (toward Johnson Pt.). The whale surfaced twice then dove and showed their fluke. Whale was massive, size of a school bus. [Follow-up call: After doing some reading, they are sure it was
humpback
and thinks possible there were 2, larger and smaller. Location: They are just up from Dogfish Bight, which is just up from Tolmie SP. There has been tons of bait fish, loons, cormorants, and other sea birds.]

Entry 5:
12:43 - Mn in Hood Canal. Last seen milling NW at
11:35, midstrait, just N of the N boundary of the sub base
. Only have my phone! Pretty distinct animal though. -Adam U
*

10:45 -
Got to base, went on a deep dive, then promptly turned around and northbound again! This whale has a fairly erratic travel pattern and long down times.

09:50 -
Now southbound off Navy Base.

08:45 -
Heyyy, it's 2020 so why not have a
humpback whale in Hood Canal
!! Northbound at good clip off Kings Spit ~0845. (Additional info from Renee: I'm sitting here at Kings Point and it's as quiet as can be until two navy ships passed heading south. All morning I've been seeing and hearing seals and sea lions but then... a humpback surfaced right in front of me!! I would have heard it long before but the ships masked the exhalation. It was moving fast. Only surfaced twice before it was out of sight so No ID. Had a weird almost "chopped off" dorsal appearance like it may have had a previous entanglement but hard to say.) -Renee Chamberland

Entry 6:
14:17 -
It's been quite a while since I've seen my pal
Gray 2261
, although I've heard of sightings by neighbors here and there. However, I happened to glance out just now and saw it passing by and feeding at the happy meal mudflats just
south of Mariners Cove
. I got a good look and can confirm the white line below the blowhole, so definitely 2261. Heading toward Polnell. -Marianne Parry

Entry 7:
Hood Canal -
[Correction: This sighting was reported as a humpback and included in our last report (
October 17, 2020) as such, but has since been positively ID'd by Alie Perez of Cascadia Research Collective as
2020 newbie gray whale 2262
, who has previously been documented for many weeks in Possession Sound with 2020 newbie 2259. CRC 2259 has also departed Possession Sound and was documented off Point Robinson, Vashon/Maury, on Oct. 18th. -gs]

11:35 - Last seen milling NW at 1135 midstrait just N of the N boundary of the sub base. Sorry for the crap photo... Only have my phone! Pretty distinct animal though. -Adam U

Lucy Sutphen called to report seeing
a single whale, not orca
, thinking
maybe juvenile humpback
today at around
09:15 (~45 minutes before low tide). She saw the whale from her home on NW Esplanade in the
North Beach, Seattle
, neighborhood (around corner from Meadow Point, Golden Gardens). They face NW and saw the whale moving east to west, close in, just a couple hundred yards off shore. She reports seeing the tail, and then head and body. Saw some barnacles. Did not see any markings to indicate orca. Cool experience. lived there 21 years and only 2-3 times seen whales, never any this close to shore.
