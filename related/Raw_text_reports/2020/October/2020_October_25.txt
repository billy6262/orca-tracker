was kind enough to pass by again this morning. It always feels like a huge stroke of luck to see it because you have to be looking at the right place at the right time since it's too cold to have the windows open to be able to listen for it. It was heading southbound, feeding from
Mariners Cove
to down past the mudflats, and then it appeared to hustle south toward Polnell. -Marianne Parry
