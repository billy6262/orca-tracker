Added: We live above North Tillicum beach so that photo is just off our deck showing the very north end of the houses. Yesterday [10/12] afternoon I saw it breach in probably the best breach I've seen in all my years of whale watching tours. Full out of the water and probably a body length high, sun shining just amazing, it's been around for over a week know. I'd say one whale that we've seen on 4 or 5 days and one night in the dark you could hear it. -Paul Belshaw

This is the same whale that Janine Harles photographed off Point No Point on
