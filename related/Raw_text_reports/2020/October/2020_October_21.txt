Orca Sightings for October 21, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Central/South Puget Sound -

10:00 -
I only saw one and it looked small. Time was 10AM Wednesday morning. I live near the end of Pt. Fosdick in Gig Harbor. My view looks over Hale Passage, straight out towards
Chamber's Bay Golf Course
. The whale was heading south. The whale had a blow spout on top and blow caught my eye. Then, I got out my binoculars and saw the tail fluke as the animal was diving. It looked like a Humpback but I only saw dark colored tail fluke, not white and black. -Laura Lewis Frank

Just saw a big water spout blow between Vashon Island and Point Defiance. Viewing from
Gig Harbor
. Haven't seen any dorsal fins. Followup: That was my thought, either gray or humpback. Unfortunately, I never saw it resurface again, but it was located mid channel. -Gaby Kinner

Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage - ~

11:00 -
Anya Sika called to report
a gray whale in Crescent Harbor
near the Naval sea plane base in Oak Harbor. Whale is out front of the commissary, moving back and forth from one side to the other in the harbor, feeding. (added: He shows up on very calm days and with high levels of water. Saw him 3 times in the last few weeks and I don't go to base that often. He is so majestic.)
