between Ruston Point & Vashon Island

Here is the
Point Robinson
pass, we were very fortunate to get a nice close pass! So very sweet to see the babes tucked in with their mamas, and the pod seemed bouncy, cuddly and happy. Hoping they filled their bellies full with loads of south sound salmon! The beach was full with palpable lightheartedness and joy, and everyone was very respectful and mindful of the social distancing rules. The Orcas brought with them a priceless energy of love and connectedness, something we are all craving at the moment, I am grateful. It was a great day, so incredibly happy to see J pod again! -Marla Smith

Just wanting to share that we saw 4 orcas from our sailboat yesterday. We were right off
Blakely Rock
just south of the Seattle - Bainbridge Ferry line. Here's a video clip of one of the orcas with her baby. It was an incredible sight.
(added in subsequent email: Yes, I'm very aware of the Whale Wise instructions to boaters. There are signs at the marinas and we take a serious interest in protecting our beautiful marine species of all kinds including mammals. We cut our engine when we saw the ferry stop expecting that something unusual was happening but not knowing what and we were delighted to see the pod of orcas swim by. There were about 4 boats mostly sailboats but a few motor boats who all cut their engines too.) -Maria Gingerich

Central Puget Sound - ~

14:00 -
These are really the only decent shots I got of the whale at
Pt. Robinson
on Sunday. It was right about 2pm. I saw it to the north of the point when I first got there, then watched it go out around the point and head south. These shots were looking east, toward Des Moines. I hope this helps! -Molly O'Brien
[
Your photos provide important documentation, especially because others reported this whale as a humpback on Sunday (which there were many in at the time so seemed reasonable), so not only did you provide documentation to confirm species but your side dorsal images tell us it's
gray whale CRC 2259

HUMPBACK WHALES - Sun, Oct 18 - San Juan Islands - Waiting for the rain to ease up. A low cloud ceiling touching the tree tops. A wet looking bald eagle roosted on the sign on Low Island drying his wings. Harbor seals rested on Flattop and a pair of bald eagles roosted on the sign on Gull Island. We pushed North and met
humpback whale MMX0167 'Stitch' at the border
. A bulk carrier passed in the shipping lane whereupon the humpback whale announced their presence by repeatedly breaching followed by percussive slaps with both pectoral fins whilst on their back.The whale crossed the border and headed for Monarch Head, still inaccessible to us. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
