Orca Sightings for October 22, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
NE Vancouver Island area -
We live on Vancouver Island. We sighted a
large group of orca (we counted 11, but we believe there to have been more)
on Thursday, Oct. 22. We
suspect Southern Residents
. Our photos and video (taken from shore) are not good quality, but we are wondering if this may be of interest to you? In any case, we would be very interested to know if there was any report or indication that they were in the area of Campbell River/Cortez Island/Mitlenatch Island on that day. Thank you for your assistance! -Patti and Mark Perepeluk

I first noticed it in the area shown (just northeast of the dock at Illahee State Park) where it remained for about 5 min, mostly under the surface, then first noticed it resurface about 200 yards south, where it blew (term?) about three separate times in 5 min (could not get a clear photo) and seemed to continue southward toward Port Orchard. -Gem Drarig

Entry 3:
South Puget Sound -

17:30 - [Gray] Whale
was in
Eld
heading north. Passed right in front of the house. That was the first surface we saw. Then I watched it still heading north, very close to shore so the surfaces were shallow. Saw it surface three more times as it headed toward
Hunter Point
. Lost sight due to trees. Jessie [CRC] knows and confirms it's a gray, photo sent to Alie.

15:00 -
Secondhand report. Humpback near Johnson Point. Trying to get more details. -Kim Merriman

Entry 4:
14:34 -
Jonathan Farney called to report a whale sighting on east side of
Johnson Point
today at around
14:30. He believes it was a
gray whale
. They saw and reported humpback a couple weeks ago, but believes just saw gray whale, this one had mottled appearance with dark and light spots vs. the all dark of the humpback. The whale surfaced directly out from house in about 25 feet of water heading north towards tip of Johnson Point. Did get video, not great, but got the third surface. Last seen moving north in about 50 feet out from shore.
[
There was confirmed gray whale in Eld Inlet later, included in our last whale sighting report
