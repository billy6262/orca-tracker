15:20 -
I live on
Totten Inlet off of SE Lynch Road
. Today around
3:20 pm my parents and I saw one
gray whale
. It surfaced several times. When we first saw it, it was about 100 feet from our shore. We didn't take pictures because we were in such awe. We have never seen a whale where we live. Eva later added: The gray whale was directly in front of us for a good 30-minutes. We believe it was feeding since the tide was in. It would surface to the top and blow water out of its hole then go under for about 3-5 minutes. It swam around mostly in the middle of the bay and appeared to be going to the direction towards Arcadia Point. We could definitely see it was a gray whale when it surfaced the water. Through binoculars we could even see barnacles on its body. My parents have lived on Totten Inlet for about 8 years and this was their first time seeing a whale. It was magnificent!!! I will be watching again today during high tide. If I see the whale I will film it. Thank you for responding. -Eva Kirpes Lorberfeld

I just wanted you to know that while rowing yesterday I spotted what I believe was a
Gray Whale on the west side of Totten Inlet
. My friend and I first saw it a little after noon yesterday (10/26) just
north of Little Skookum Inlet
. It stayed in the same area within a couple of 100 yards of shore (around a working dock and an old dock with pilings and a walkway still in place) for the 15 minutes or so we were there. It would surface 1-3 times in the same area and then dive for a few minutes. When it reappeared, it was still within 100 yards of where it went down. We returned to the area on our way home around
2:30 and found it about a half mile north and a little farther off of shore. We only saw it surface a few times and the area covered was significantly larger than when we saw it earlier. Both times we saw it we were the only water craft anywhere around for miles. This is the video I took during our first sighting. We had been sitting in the same spot for 10 minutes or so after someone on shore spotted us rowing and yelled to us to say there was a whale near us. This video was on its third or fourth surfacing. video - https://youtu.be/1H7BPS2iV8A -Rod Sternagel

Entry 6:
12:59 -
Just walking by the window facing the water and saw a spout. This was all I got after running to get my camera.
Race Lagoon heading south
. Now all I want to do is look out the windows. (added: I was going to say that the whale must have turned around because as I was watching he/she went under towards the southeast.) -Brenda Kidd

Entry 7:
15:30-

16:30 -
I believe I saw a Minke whale near
Bremerton in Dyes Inlet
yesterday [10/26] from

3:30-
4:30. I would have posted but couldn't get a picture or identify what it was until I did some research. I thought it might be the gray whale that had been spotted recently near Bremerton, but this one didn't seem as large as I would think (spotted from a distance though) and it surfaced snout first, which seemed unique. I noticed it surface snout first mouth open, then saw the blowhole and dive back into the water. It did this in a pattern: surface/blowhole 4 times, then submerged for around 5+ minutes, then repeat. I also noticed a lump/fin on its head/back, but it was difficult to tell which from my view. Lindsey later added: If I see it again today, I'll provide an update on the Facebook page and try to get a picture. It kept swimming up and down the inlet
between Manette Bridge and Warren Bridge
, so it may still be in the area. -Lindsey Malkames
