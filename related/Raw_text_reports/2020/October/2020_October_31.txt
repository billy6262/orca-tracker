Entry 2:
E Strait of Juan de Fuca - 10/31
: A beautiful day...the best of a Pacific NW fall...sunshine, crisp white Mt. Baker, glass calm seas, and for me, a FIVE species day by the time I got home! First, we found
two humpbacks (MMY0106 Aerie)
and a pal with a sort of split fin, no fluke photos to match to. Then
three minkes
cruising and lunge feeding around the same area (Middle Bank, off San Juan Island); then
Dall's porpoise
, which is a treat as I haven't seen much of them; of course,
harbor porpoise
; and the bonus...I made it to Ft. Ebey in the setting sun to catch a very distant look at some
Bigg's orcas exiting Admiralty
! -Bonnie Gretz

humpback

Entry 5:
09:15-

09:40 -
Viewing from
Clinton
. (
Between Hat island and Clinton
...North of ferry terminal closer to Clinton.) Water very calm, clear and sunny. Heading north towards Saratoga Passage. Two whales... First spotted
9:15 am going south then turned north. Last seen headed north at
9:40 am. New to Whidbey Island and not sure as to type of whales. We saw what looked to be the backs with larger shadows. We have been looking every day since moving to Clinton two months ago so this was very exciting. They would swim along top for almost one minute then disappear... then resurfacing 50-75 yards away. -John Shackman
