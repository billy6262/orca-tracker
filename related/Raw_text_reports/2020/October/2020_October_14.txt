Hello! We are near
Tilly Point on South Pender Island. We saw 4-5 orcas heading west
through Boundary Pass at about 6pm. There were
also 2 humpbacks
heading southeast-ish at the same time. All in a beautiful purple sunset. No pictures of the actual whales but a really exceptional sighting for us. -Madison Duffin

Entry 3:
14:56 - Humpback again in Port Susan
in front of our house [above North Tillicum beach] mid channel, breaching and giving quite a show. Started at 2pm wed afternoon, still on going. [later he added: ""Whale was here for about 2 hours putting on quite a show."] -Paul Belshaw

Entry 4:
15:00 - Humpback Stitch was found outside Friday Harbor heading south
... around 3pm today (Wednesday)...we headed north past Lummi Island, and finally came upon
humpback MMX0167, aka Stitch
right outside Friday Harbor. H/she was slowly heading south, and gave us a couple of lovely fluke-up dives so the i.d. could be confirmed. So nice to be out on the water as the season winds down. -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 5:
11:23 - [Humpbacks]
They're still there. I just saw two of them south of
Jefferson Point from the Seattle-Kingston ferry
. One breach and lots of tails. Good visibility too. -Julius Raymond

Entry 6:
baleen whale near Mukilteo and Everett
. This whale was seen from aboard Schooner Adventuress yesterday (10/14) morning just north of Shilshole Bay. I'm having trouble deciding if it's
a minke or young humpback
. The crew member that took the video said the dorsal fin was more of a pointy shape but the tail shape makes me and another marine nerd friend (Patrick Hutchins) second guess a minke ID. What do you think? Thank you! -Jennifer Huntley - video - https://www.facebook.com/OrcaNetwork/posts/10164626199475601 (by Kathryn Hoerauf/no permission)

Yours in this video is
definitely a humpback
! May or may not be same whale as today's up north. There have been different humpbacks in central and north Sound at the same time, also grays up near Everett/Mukilteo/Tulalip/Camano, so likely you saw one of the two HBs who've been in central Sound or completely different whale all together. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 7:

Ok I have to say I'm excited. I just can't stand it. I'm watching
a gray feeding
. Viewing from Legion Park in Everett in line with
southeast end of Hat Island closer to Everett
. Trending slowly southbound. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 8:
Central Puget Sound
- My boyfriend and I saw a whale at
Moran Beach
on Wednesday evening at sunset. it looked like a humpback, but I thought it was too small so I didn't know what it was, now I'm second guessing myself. Definitely
looked like a mini humpback whale
. We saw it surface 4 times right in front of us. -Ceara Jade Parks

13:00 -
Large
whale in Elliott Bay!
At
1:00pm, about 200 yards out from the
Olympic Sculpture Park
. Maybe a humpback? Not an orca. Went under and haven't seen again, yet! (Added: large body! No blow (though I saw a bit of a splash), no dorsal fin unless it was smaller/further back). -Dana Reinert
