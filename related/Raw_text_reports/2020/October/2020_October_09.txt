We saw them circling around

keeping presence same place. Milling, sounding, fluke visible.

14:25 - For certain 2 humpbacks
(possibly 3rd) still milling back and forth same genera area. Surfacing and diving together
SW of Jefferson Head/Point Jefferson
in it just west if southbound traffic lanes or just west of. Seas choppy, some whitecaps. Warm breeze day..

13:45 -
Up again. I do take my eyes off so possible I'm missing an interval. If not, then about 10 min. down times.

13:35 -
Up and then sounded again. They are swimming together, often in tandem, so beautiful.

13:25 -
Can confirm I'm seeing
at least 2 humpbacks
. Same general area as my earlier report. Whales are milling back and forth, up for several blows then sounding. Seeing multiple backs and flukes. Observing from across the Sound at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.

Saw blows of
at least 2 baleen whales just south of Jefferson Head
in southbound shipping lanes milling (out from about mid Port Madison). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

And then the minute I say they are going south they turn around again!! Just hanging around.

15:37 -
They have moved a bit southward now, almost in the middle of the channel. Very busy with their surfacing.

15:30 -
They are still there....watching them from
Point Jefferson
now....VERY busy surfacing in short intervals then fluking.

10:25 - Point Jefferson, Kingston
. There are
three humpbacks
milling around with a gradual trend south. Several surfaces then fluking. Although closer to the Kitsap side too far out for any identification. -Chris Beamer Otterson
