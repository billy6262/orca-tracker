Orca Sightings for August 15, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T18s)
- As we got closer the only boat on scene was about to leave and said
the whales turned more northerly and were aiming more towards False Bay on San Juan Island
. Two of the four animals they lost track of. We changed course to intercept the orcas and scanned with the binoculars. Alas, there they were - the unmistakable
T19B
with his massive dorsal fin could be seen about 2 1/2 miles away and his mother was traveling with him. We didn't see his younger brother or his (presumable) grandmother. We paralleled the orcas as they traveled into shore at Hannah Heights and they turned south. Another boat spotted the other two family members further south (maybe 2 miles away) and they were northbound headed towards the others. Both pairs of orcas traveled down the San Juan Island shoreline and we stayed with them until Eagle Cove before breaking off to head back to the barn. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

18:43 - Orcas in False Bay
this evening! We saw one that was significantly smaller. A baby? [No,
T18s
]. -Karen Hadac

17:00 -
Sounds like they are
SE of Discovery Island
now, still in Canadian waters, heading north but on a course for San Juan Island rather than up Haro.

15:45 - South of Discovery Island
on the border:
T18s heading NE towards San Juan Island

We are always excited to find
Orca off Sooke, B.C.
and today we found
Transient Killer Whales (T018 & T019's)
hunting south of Race Rocks! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

Entry 2:
Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca (T65As with T137 and T137D) -
The T065As were all back together with mom, and traveling with
T137 and T137D
(thirty-seven y.o. Loon and eight y.o. Wright). Making their way slowly
down Rosario
, they seemed to be heading back to Puget Sound after their three-day absence. Jack (T137A) was not present, and there was no evidence of fourteen-year-old Tempest (T137B). The two of them were last seen Friday night heading down San Juan Channel with all of the T036sâ€¦April Ryan, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

11:20-

11:30 - A gray
(presumably 2261) came up from the south feeding fairly close to shore (happy meal mudflats) but then did a sharp turn out into the channel, heading toward
Utsalady
. Still out there as of
11:30am, and I can't tell if it's going to hang a right or left or just have lunch right where it is. Thanks! -Marianne Parry

Entry 4:
west of Jetty Island
(about 47.99429, -122.24487), we saw
a gray whale feeding in water
just west of us, still in shallow water. Hope this fluke shot is enough to identify. -Paul Smith
