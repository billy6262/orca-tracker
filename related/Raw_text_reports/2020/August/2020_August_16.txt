spread themselves
across Saratoga Passage between Camano and Whidbey Island
milling, breaching, tail-slapping and cart-wheeling as they wended their way south. Occasional directional changes surprised a few boaters, keeping everyone guessing as to where the whales would surface next, the 'whoosh' of their exhalations carrying on the warm breeze on what must surely be the hottest day so far this summer -Sandra Pollard

Entry 4:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

11:30 - Gray mid/channel, north end of Utsalady
. I'm watching a large whale-watching boat as it sat by a gray heading north at northern tip of Camano. It's pretty far away so no photos or ID, but it def looks like a gray in binocs, and odds are it's 2261. It may have been feeding because it wasn't moving very fast, but too deep for waving his fins at us. -Marianne Parry
