13:40 -
What a day! At about
1:40pm this afternoon they passed by me for the third time today! While I will never complain at seeing these gorgeous creatures, I hope they're just hunting in a narrow zone and not disoriented for some reason as they've gone up & back several times in a relatively short period of time!

09:08 -
They just passed back again going
northbound
now towards
Henderson Bay
. They're going deep for very long periods so I lose them for quite a while.

3 Orcas go by southbound in the Carr Inlet

06:34 - Orcas back in Carr Inlet
east of Glen Cove. I saw one male headed north and just a couple out in the middle of Carr inlet headed south. I only saw the northbound orca for a minute before trees blocked the view. The southbound pod was moving fast. They were what looked like a half a mile apart. -Bill DeLeo

Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

18:30 -
The
gray
was back again this evening around
6:30pm. It was heading southbound, feeding relatively close to the shore as it passed
Mariners' Cove
. The situation got a little too exciting/aggravating at one point because a large aluminum boat came zooming across from Camano and stopped right in [the whale's] way (grrrr), and [he/she] appeared to be so busy eating that he didn't pay attention and almost ran into the boat (literally - it was within a few feet). The gray did a very abrupt turn at that point and headed out into the channel, and ended up doing a big detour around the boat and got back to the desired eating area a little further down the beach, and resumed his normal feeding pattern toward Polnell.

16:15 -
Today around
4:15pm (8/10/2020), a gray did a quick pass southward toward
Polnell
. I grabbed a couple of shots before it was out of my view, but it was moving so fast that it was hard to anticipate where its lovely huge head was going to pop up. -Marianne Parry
*

18:05 - Gray whale
at
6:05pm Monday night just east of
Mariners Cove
, very close to shore. We live on Hunskor Hill Ln., and there is frequently a gray feeding offshore close to high tide but not full high tide. Large fin on display but too brief to get picture and then whale turned in more usual position. Hope this helps, new to this, happy to provide different info if more useful. -Paula Despins

10:04 -
