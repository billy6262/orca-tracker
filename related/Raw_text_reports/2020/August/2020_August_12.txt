I saw some
orcas are heading north up Colvos Passage
at about
8:25amâ€¦I live on Olalla side and look across at Vashon mid channel. I tried to get a good picture but they got too far away before I could. Right after that, there were several porpoises that hung around for about an hour. I started second guessing if the first ones were porpoises and not whales, but the fins were very black and pointier unlike the porpoises. I hope I wasn't wrong. -Therese Oberstar-Carlson
