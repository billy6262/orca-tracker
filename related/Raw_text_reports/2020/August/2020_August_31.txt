Orca Sightings for August 31, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
19:50 - Discovery Park
at the South Bluff lookout. At least two individuals. They were hanging out in the same area for a while until some sailboats and a dinghy probably spooked them while trying to get a better look. I speculated they could have been feeding because they were kind of in their hunter's circle corralling zone for a while before they moved on. One of them definitely looks like a little baby orca! It looked like the two individuals clearly seen maybe broke away from the pod at least temporarily. -Ethan Oddy

They are just
north of the ferry lane
, pretty much right at the ferry lane, swimming in circles by those four boats and breeching and spraying.

14:51 -
We are a mile north of downtown and now have to strain our eyes south to see. I think people on ferry can see now. Closer to shore.

14:47 - [orcas]
They are headed into downtown
Edmonds
area now. On their way now. Soon to be near ferry lane. -AnaLisa Gerbig

Just passed us in
Chennault Beach, Mukilteo

*

13:46 -
Two groups just passed my house heading south, very close to
Mukilteo
shore. Mid way between ferry and Picnic Point. There were 3 in the front group, followed by another group of maybe 5? -Jodi Krause Poissant
*

13:30 -
Janet Ploof of Langley also reported: Today,

1:30, at Mukilteo Ferry dock
three (or more?) beautiful orcas cruised right along the fishing pier at Ivar's. Nice day!
*

13:30 - [orcas]
Three groups of multiples moving slowly close, surfacing and blowing to Mukilteo side, 3/4 mile
south of Mukilteo ferry
. One definitely much larger than others. -Vicki Zellman
*

13:13 -
We were on the beach by the
Mukilteo Lighthouse
(Monday 8/31/2020) and saw a small group of orcas swimming south past us. I saw three, but others think they saw five. Other walkers on the beach told us they'd never seen any orcas in their 20 years there. The orcas' presence attracted a number of small boats in the area. These boats seemed to keep an appropriate distance, or the orcas just didn't care. It was quite a thrill. -Howie Silver
*

13:00 - A Mukilteo orca
video- from 1pm today. -Jennifer Gregerson?
*

12:50 - [orcas] Approaching Mukilteo
close to shore. -Tyler McKeen

11:29 - [orcas]
After about an hour of milling and a lot of surface activity south of
Camano Head
, they are finally traveling southeast, closer to Hat Island, and then they vanished. -Danielle Pennington
*

11:21 -
It looks like they are going to take the east side of
Hat Island
. Spread out, southbound.

11:15 - [orcas]
Viewing large group from Columbia Beach
between Camano and Hat Island
. Heading south toward the ferry. (I was at Columbia beach looking north.) -Donna George

2 individuals ahead of the rest, traveling VERY close to
Whidbey shore, southbound
. -Rachel Haight
*

11:00 -
They are eating a meal but slowly working south.

10:50 -
It appears that all members of both pods are back together again. So, we have 10 orcas.

10:49 -
They are split up a bit but still mostly just milling
south of Sandy Point
. A group closer to shore is about a mile south of Sandy Point.

10:15 - T65A pod and T137 pod southbound just passed Sandy Point
. -Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express
*
Just like the first day of August when the
T65As and T137s
put in an appearance off Whidbey Island, the last day of the month heralded their arrival in
Saratoga Passage
once again as they traveled south this morning. After a quick sprint to Langley we caught the tail-end of the two groups, now complete with all members, rounding Sandy Point, and just managed to catch a breach before they did a disappearing act until a later sighting off
Mukilteo
, from whence they continued
southbound
. -Sandra Pollard
*

10:13 - [orcas] Just passed Langley
, really spread out. -Allie Hudec
*
It's not often that I have seen
orcas
close into shore at Whale Bell Park and with low tide. just made it in time! no seconds to spare. groups were spread out but not by too far. In the sleepy village, there was only the
Langley
City's groundskeeper/garbage collector and a woman walking her small dog on the beach. I was able to alert her, and groundskeeper heard the bell, then the village came alive. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

10:21 -
They've turned
south now heading towards Clinton
and the ferry.

Langley
(Northernmost downtown),

Entry 7:
Strait of Juan de Fuca - ~

, WA. around 11am. 200 to 400 YARDS or closer to shore, a pod but don't know how many. All fishing boats in area stopped engines and let them pass on heading East. -Russella KRause
*

Entry 8:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

12:30 - Gray 2261
made a sudden appearance outside my house today (8/31/20,
12:30pm) and I was able to grab the camera for a couple of snaps before it made a hard left turn and headed for Utsalady. It was heading southbound and reached the southern end of
Mariners Cove
before heading into the channel. I only saw it for a couple of minutes close to shore and it did not appear to be feeding - no pecs waving or anything like that. -Marianne Parry
