17:54 -
At
Edmonds Marina Beach Park

Traveling North
. -Kevin Doar

Entry 4:
17:00 - Gray whale just offshore of Hunskor Hill, just east of Mariners Cove
from
5:00 pm to
5:10pm on Sunday…Paula Despins
*

17:30 - Gray
appeared outside the entrance to the marina at
Mariners' Cove
(to my north), but not super close in. Everyone ran out to watch, thinking it would come down the beach, but it was camera-shy today and headed out into the channel again, moving toward the northern end of Camano.
15:00 or
15:30ish - Gray was suddenly at the happy meal mudflats just south of Mariners' Cove. I don't think it came down the shoreline so it prob came in from the channel. It did not appear to be doing much, if any, feeding and disappeared around the corner to the south. -Marianne Parry

Saratoga is with
#2259 and #2262, East of Gedney

Yesterday we were boating from
Blake Island towards Alki Beach
. We got some video of
Cinco
, I believe. We saw it around
2:30pm on Sunday. -Brittney Mitchell
[
per Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective: "That's a great picture, and it's definitely
Cinco
. He picked up that distinctive scar sometime in the last year."
]
*
I think this is a
common dolphin
. Maybe the same one reported off Whidbey a few days ago? This guy was just off
Alki
and played with our boat and others all day, he followed us all over the place!! -Jessica Gasperini
[
Even with the distortion, several spots appear to be in the right place for it to be Cinco. While I can't call it a positive ID, I'm convinced that is who you saw." -Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective
