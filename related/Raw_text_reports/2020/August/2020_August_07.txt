Orca Sightings for August 7, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
17:52:30 PDT - Sighting Location (Lat/Lon): 50.85000,-127.43900 -
Number Sighted: 25
- Assumed multiple pods transiting
Queen Charlotte Strait
. Count not exact - whales were transiting past on all sides of the vessel both near and off in the distance. Unfortunately I did not get any photos. I was too excited to see all of them that I did not think to get a picture. The orcas were southbound, and they were clustered in groups - transiting on both the port and starboard side of our (northbound) vessel - almost like they were a super pod. We neutralized our engines after the first sighting and more and more kept coming - we lost count. -Rebekka Esbjornson, Shore Operations Manager, Lighthouse Excursions, Ward Cove, AK (Whale Alert App)

Entry 2:
Strait of Georgia -
On Friday,
August 7 we were motor sailing on our way up towards Lund travelling about 8 knots with the current and wind behind us. It had been raining or drizzling most of the day. We had had no sightings of any whales all day. At
4:30 pm we had just passed the sandbar off Harwood Island just
north of Powell River
(49 deg 53.288 N, 124 deg 38.823 W). Then suddenly, with no warning, this giant black fin shot out of the water right beside the boat on the port side. It was close enough to touch. The top of the fin was above the level of our lifelines and a large part of the black and white body was above the water beside us. As soon as we recovered enough from the shock to realize we had
a big male killer whale
beside us we shut off the engine. We were still travelling at 6.5 knots with just the wind in the jib. The whale disappeared briefly, then I saw a black fin momentarily at our bow. We looked around for the whale and then saw it under the boat on the port side again. It came up a second time on our port side and this time I managed to grab a few quick photos before he disappeared again. While the whale was beside us we heard him make a squeaking sound very similar to the noise made by dolphins. It seemed as if he was talking to us. The whale appeared to be playing with our boat the same way dolphins sometimes do. I had not heard of killer whales doing this before. This made for an incredibly exciting day. We saw no other whales that day. Do you have any idea what pod this whale belonged to and what he was trying to do? P.S. We never deliberately approach whales, but sometimes they come to us. -Uwe and Anne Borgmann, Nanaimo, BC

Entry 4:
T137A and family
are back, along with the
T65As
, thrilling whale watchers waiting on the beach at
Fox Spit
as the T137s approached, their dorsal fins cutting through the glassy waters on their northbound travels in Saratoga Passage. Once again, T137A sent shock waves through spectators of all ages by his sheer size and presence as he cruised along the shoreline keeping pace with excited children running along the beach. This was yet another incredible encounter with a group of whales that seem to favor making an unbelievably close pass, oblivious to social distancing and almost brushing against admiring spectators standing just a few yards away. photo - "Children on the beach at Fox Spit rush to keep pace with T137A." -Sandra Pollard

Entry 7:
Northern Saratoga Passage - ~

17:00 -
Good ol' Gray returned to feed once the tide came in a little this afternoon. Around 5pm, it was cruising and feeding southbound past Mariners' Cove heading toward
Polnell
. Lots of splashing and flipper waving. I noticed one thing different - there is something hanging off the left pectoral fin but it's too far away to see it well even with zoom. Hopefully just seaweed, but it occurred to me that it almost looks like fishing lure type stuff. Also, that same fin looks like it possible has damage on the back edge. To me, it looks like the edge has been scraped. Could be just the lighting or whatever, but thought I'd mention it. I took a bunch of photos to try to get a good shot of the fin.

15:38 -
Well, the gray realized it was a little early tide-wise for the first seating in this spot, so headed back out into the channel and is almost to the northern end of
Camano/Utsalady
as of
15:30. It snuck right by a whale-watching boat which was heading south in a hurry. Again, I can't swear to it being …… but through binoculars I saw the tail fluke that looks like it had a bite taken out, as well as some big knuckles, so the signs fit. Enjoy your evening!

15:18 - A gray whale
just swam in from the channel just south of
Mariners Cove
and is feeding out from the big rocks that stick out at low tide… It was heading toward Polnell but just changed its mind and is heading north toward me now. There's a lot of seaweed on the mud flats now, so it must be feeding out deeper today. Thanks! -Marianne Parry
*

16:43 - [Gray whale] is off Mariner's Cove
right now. Just got a cabin on Whidbey on the beach so am new to posting. -Paula Despins
*

13:30 - Lone [gray] off Maple Grove Beach [north Camano Island]
.
13:30, headed north. -Ashly Hale
*
At
12:10 PM on this Friday afternoon, I see one spout
east of Polnell Point
about 1 mile off shore. Closer to Whidbey Island than Camano Island. Between Utsalady Point on Camano Island and Polnell Point on Whidbey Island. -Steve Rothboeck
