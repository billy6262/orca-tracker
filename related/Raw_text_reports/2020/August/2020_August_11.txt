Entry 2:
Haro Strait (T10s) -

17:16 - Middle of Haro, just north of LK
. -Ariel Yseth
*

14:48-

15:24 - Haro Strait, 1/2 mile south of Edwards Point. 2-3 orcas, T10s, northbound
, changing direction to the northwest and then west away from the island. At first sight the orcas were between the shore and the line of boats but within a few minutes they dove and finally came up on the far side of the boats. I watched as they moved NW, W and then N again nearing the Canadian border. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Center for Whale Research Encounter #36: "Orcinus" arrived on scene at 1345 off False Bay.
T10 and T10C
were foraging way inshore off the entrance to
False Bay
. They went deep into Kanaka Bay (a place where T13 and T14 were held captive for a period of time in 1976) and looked like they made a kill on a probable harbor seal. The pair came back out of the cove acting like they were feeding... [See CWR Encounter #36 for full encounter summary and photos] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-36

Admiralty Inlet - (T65A2, T137A, T137B) -

16:42 -
Kit Turner just called. She is seeing two big orcas (someone else said 3rd present) off the
north end of Lagoon Point
heading
northbound
at a steady clip. The orcas were very close in on Whidbey side, but looks now deviated a bit offshore more in line towards Keystone/Ebey (not into Admiralty Bay).
*

16:40 -
At least one
orca
headed north past
Lagoon Point
closer to shore. Moving fast. -Rebecca Mcginnis
*

16:28 - Lagoon Point
. Haven't seen fully, but a couple at least here. -Jana Shinn Quiocho
*

12:41 -
Grouped up
headed north
, pointed at southern Whidbey.

12:38 -
How do I alert WSF? Spokane about to leave and whales in mid channel in ferry lanes. [Alisa, Orca Network, alerted WSF]

12:27 - [orcas]
Watching from south end
Edmonds
fishing pier. Spread out and headed north about 1/4 mile south of me. -Neil Emery
*

13:00 -
Was about the last I laid eyes on this trio. They were approx
3+ miles south of Possession Point
heading northbound. I then had tasks/took my eyes off and haven't found them since. Visibility is good but seas choppy so not ideal.

12:40 -
These 3 moved off shore but still on Edmonds side, grouped up out from central
Edmonds, heading steady northbound
in choppy seas.

12:05 -
Resumed travel. Can confirm
T65A2, 137A, 137B, now northbound
, north end Richmond Beach, well on this side. Edmonds next place to be!

11:55.
They have stalled and are hunting just inside weather buoy off north end park! Eek. Spyhop!

11:45.
Very close to shore,
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park, northbound
!
---Bigg's Transient killer whales or orcas (mammal-eating type) have been keeping a presence in inland Puget Sound much of spring and nearly every day this summer. The T65As & T137s are two of the most well-known/observed of the Ts this far inland. These two families had been traveling together for over a week before these 3 split off. This was the third day of their split from the families (who were off Whidbey at the time). I arrived at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in time to see one of the males gliding north close to shore. I hurried down waterside to watch this trio come near, then stall out for about 5 minutes before they then continued on northbound, eventually exiting Puget Sound that evening while their families remained. The boats you see in the latter part were out there idly fishing all morning and in no way positioned themselves in front of the orcas (which would be the wrong thing to do). They just got lucky, and by staying idle the orcas could swim around them.
NOTE: It is important we all educate ourselves on the laws and best practices when out on watercraft around whales and all marine mammals, and to help educate others on the laws and guidelines, as well. It is also important and smart to keep a perspective that not every interaction is intentional and/or harassment as was the case in this video.

16:15 -
At approximately
4:15 pm today, I sighted a pod of orca whales just
west of Baby Island
(viewed from our home in Greenbank, due west of Baby Island). There were a
t least 5, maybe up to 8
. They were initially spread out over an area of a few hundred feet, a lot of activity, tail slapping, rolling, then all came closer together. Hunting a seal, eating salmon? It was quiet for a few minutes and then there was a lot of activity again. This went on for 30 minutes as they slowly traveled into the mouth of Holmes Harbor and I lost sight of them. I participated in your 50th year commemoration - Lolita/Tokitae/Sk'aliChehl-tenaut, and have been thinking about her and having thoughts of welcoming her home soon. -Martha Poppy Sinclair
*

16:14 -
Appears from a distance that the hunt is on just northwest of Baby Island.

16:06 - Moving south
quickly. [map indicates location between Greenbank and Baby Island. -gs]

16:05 - [orcas]
Watching them make their way
south along Whidbey towards Holmes
. Not a boat in sight. -Neil Emery
*

15:40 -
Group of 4 to 5 orcas have passed
Hidden Beach and turned toward Baby Island
and Holmes Harbor. -Sandra Pollard
*

14:00 - Ts in 2 groups south of Madrona, Camano
, heading
southbound
mid channel. -Tera Carlson McEwan (CWW)
*
While walking our beach this morning, we saw this
passing Gray Whale
. Shortly after, we could see an Orca pod cruising along Camano Island! The Orca photos were shot @ significant distance so they are not great. Wow! What a treat to see them both on the same morning. -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA

13:05-

13:20 -
We were about 300 yards off; yesterday [8/11], between
1:05 and
1:20 pm; hubs took the images with a Nikon zoom, and we transferred the images to cell! I see that the GPS on the phone identified it as just offshore
between Polnell and Strawberry Points
just north out of
Crescent Harbor
between Saratoga Pass and Skagit Bay. There were moments when we saw four Orcas at one time, and at one point we thought we saw five.-Patti McCoy
*

13:29 - Orca
followup - I think there were more than three orcas out there, but they were outnumbered by the paparazzi flotilla (15 boats at one point! lol).
Heading south
.

12:45 -
This is shaping up to be a busy whale day so far! One of the big whale watching boats (Island Explorer plus a couple more arriving now) are watching some whales mid-channel
between Mariners Cove and Utsalady
. I saw three in binoculars - one smaller than the other two. Pretty sure they are orcas. Still there as of
12:45 slowly heading south....Marianne Parry
*

11:30 - [orcas] Passing Madrona
, appear to be still northbound at
11:30. Hugging the Camano shoreline. ---It was another thrill to see the
T65As and T137s in Saratoga Passage
on Monday (11th) - both northbound and southbound! They truly hugged the Camano shoreline in both directions. Three of their members were still in Puget Sound so there were 7 whales in Saratoga. All images zoomed and cropped. -Jill Hein
*

10:24 -
Actually there are two groups, one large male in one group with 2 to 3 others, and then meeting up with another group that has a male and a couple of others, still northbound right out from
Eagle Crest, Camano side
.

10:20 - 3 to 4 orcas north of Eagle Crest
, still northbound but they seem to be swirling around a bit, maybe hunting? -Joan Smith
*

09:30 -
They're [orcas] right off
Cama Beach (northbound)
! -Carrie Elder Hulbert

09:20 -
Relaying report of
3 orca northbound by Cama Beach

Northern Saratoga Passage -

11:32 -
I was pleasantly surprised this morning to see gray (locally called Spartacus) feasting in the usual spot outside the southern tip of
Mariners Cove
. I'm assuming it came up from Polnell, but lingered so long in front of my place (about 20 min) that it wasn't totally clear which direction it was going. It finally decided to continue north, feeding a little bit mostly moving. Before getting to the marina entrance, it swerved out into the channel and
headed toward Skagit Bay
. -Marianne Parry

10:54 -
The extended guest g
ray is feeding at Mariners Cove
. -Terra Parham
--- While walking our beach this morning, we saw this
passing Gray Whale
, which looked and sounded familiar (when it spouted it made sort of a flubber sound). Shortly after, we could see an
Orca pod cruising along Camano Island
! The Orca photos were shot @ significant distance so they are not great. Wow! What a treat to see them both on the same morning. -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA

Entry 7:

11:00 -
My husband and I live on
Oak Bay
, just south of the Oak Bay County Park and the
Indian Island bridge
. We face due east and look straight across at
Indian and Marrowstone Islands
. This morning (Aug. 11th) at around 11 am, we sighted what
appeared to be a very large pod of marine mammals
heading south. They had just come through the cut under the Indian Island bridge and were porpoising their way south. We guessed by their dorsal fins that they were
possibly common dolphins
. There had to be
well over a hundred to 2 hundred of them
. The line stretched from in front of our house as far south as we can see. They were relatively small and traveling at a pretty fast pace. We have lived here for over 40 years and never seen anything like this. The weather was calm and we had a good view but they were probably about 2000 feet out from us. -Susan and Scott - via Betsy Carlson, Citizen Science Coordinator, PTMSC

10:30 or
11:00:
Saw
a largish group of whales off Norwegian Point in Hansville
, Washington. They were large, dark gray. We only saw the backs and blows. I first spotted them because they were churning up a lot of water as they traveled close to the surface. With our small binoculars, we could not tell what type they were. There did not appear to have any fins, just a smooth back. The group was heading north and slightly west. They came from the south (Puget Sound side) of the Kitsap Peninsula. When we spotted them, they were staying closer to the Kitsap and Olympic Peninsula sides rather than the mainland and Whidbey.
Followup
: We live on the first hill above
Hansville
, but not on the bluff. We have a view between the neighbors' houses. I look at size related to that gap between the houses. We see a lot of boat traffic. The whales were significantly larger than a large pleasure boat. There were a couple that were quite large. I could sometimes see the blows without binoculars if the whales were a bit closer to shore. When I looked at the churning water with the binoculars, I could
clearly see separate whales
in most of the disturbances. The backbone was clearly evident in each one I saw. The skin did not look mottled, just a shiny black or dark gray, but I couldn't really tell. The shape looks more like the grays in the pictures. In looking at pictures on the internet, they had knuckles on their back. They didn't look like the pictures of the humpbacks. They were too large to be a group of sea lions. As I said before, there was no evidence of a dorsal fin. They did not look like either a minke or an orca. What surprised me was the number. I did not count the number of separate "whitecaps," which is how I could see the individuals. It took the group a while to get past. There were
at least 20 and perhaps more
. It really surprised me as to how many there were. As I said, most were travelling on the surface when I saw them go by. They did not dive in my view. Usually, when we have had a whale sighting, there has only been one or two. To see such a large group was astounding. -Tonnie Wolfe
