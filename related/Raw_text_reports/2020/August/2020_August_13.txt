Orca Sightings for August 13, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juan Islands (T18s; T36 and T36Bs; T36As; T65A2, T137A, and T137B) T36As, San Juan Channel
. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network
*
Around noon
T18's
ended up doing a big circle in Georgia Strait and reportedly joined up with the
T36's (T36 and T36B's) and T36A's. T65A2, T137A and T137B
also joined the party and they all crossed the US border about
2:30pm and travelled
down the west side of Patos and Sucia Island
. The orcas we were watching earlier
[T65As minus T65A2, and T137s minus T137A and T137B]
traveled east in
Boundary Pass
. At around 5pm they took off at speed to go join the others who were approximately 7 miles away.
T65A2
joined back with his family and they continued around the bottom of
Sucia
and headed north with the T18's nearby. The
T36's and T36A's along with T137A and T137B came down the north side of Orcas Island in Presidents Channel
, through Spring Passage, and came down
San Juan Channel passing Friday Harbor
around
8:25pm. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Entry 2:
Haro Strait (T65As and T137s minus T65A2, T137A, and T137B)
. Another report of a different group [from
T18s
] of orcas found off the southwest side of
San Juan Island near False Bay
came over the radio. It was reported as the T65A's (minus T65A2) with T137 and youngest offspring T137D (T137's offspring T137A and T137B had dispersed with T65A2 four days earlier - we saw these three orcas yesterday at the border north of Turn Pt.). These two families of orcas had spent the last couple of weeks in Puget Sound and were near Seattle the day before. It's not uncommon for orcas to travel 50-100 miles in a day. â€¦we began seeing the blows as they
rounded Kellett Bluff on Henry Island
. The orcas were spread out in loose groups traveling north quickly on the flood current. After a long dive of several minutes we noticed 13 yr. old male orca
T65A3
swimming at speed back to the south in our direction. Suddenly, all the orcas surfaced off our starboard side in a nice tight group milling with 3 of them logging at the surface. We're not sure what caused them to stop as they had - maybe they found prey or were deciding on which route to take but it wasn't long before they resumed travel to the north again. We paralleled the orcas all the way up to Turn Pt. Lighthouse until they crossed the border continuing north to the Pender Bluffs. -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
