Entry 4:
Reported as orcas
] under
Fox Island Bridge in Gig Harbor
at 1pm, headed south towards Wollochet. My dad saw them from Fox Island Bella Beach, four or five, splashing/hunting behavior. He followed them down Cromwell in his car for about 45 minutes swimming toward Wollochet Bay/the Narrows. No idea which way they turned after that. I haven't seen any other reports of orcas in the area in the last day or so. He seemed pretty positive… -Annie Hilen
[
From Dave Anderson and Laurie Shuster, Cascadia Research Collective: "...The video is from pretty far away so we can't confirm for sure that it's dolphins. But we didn't see anything that made us think orca or harbor porpoise either. It's likely that it's dolphins since they were seen there a few weeks earlier and have been traveling around in the general vicinity…Thanks! Laurie and Dave"

The amazing power of the Apex predators in the Ocean! These
Transient Killer Whales (T065A's & B's)
were doing 15 knots at times...
heading south west off Victoria
today! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations
*

Entry 5:
T37A's near Reef island
. We watched them for sometime as they cruised the shorelines of the Wasp islands and soon noticed two of the orcas were unaccounted for. We had reports soon after of more orca whales in
Presidents Channel
and headed that direction. When we got on scene, we discovered it was the missing T37A's and they were both out hunting away from the pod. T37A1 and T37A3 were around 4 miles from their pod but today showed us they are completely self-sufficient. While we were with them, we watched as they hunted down a harbor seal before heading back down toward where we had left the rest of their pod. -Tyson, Island Adventures
