Orca Sightings for August 20, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sooke! …we found 12 Transient/Biggs Killer Whales (T069's, T109's & T101's)
…-Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

Entry 2:
Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca (T60s and T2B)
- … We passed Goose Island cormorant rookery and Cattle Point Lighthouse and headed out across Haro Strait to
Middle Bank. The T60 family
of 6 orcas including accompanying female T2B had been milling in the same location for 2 to 3 hours but began slowly traveling North as we arrived. We were able to sail alongside wing on wing and a beam reach while the wind held. There was a beautiful view of the Olympic mountains to the South of us. … -David and Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Good old
gray 2261
came back for dessert tonight. I watched it feeding in the happy meal mudflats just south of me from about
18:30 until
19:30, and had to run back inside because the rain started again. The tide was really high tonight (12') so it maybe had full access to all the yummy goodness hiding under the seaweed.

16:35 -
Didn't expect to get a good look at our gray friend today with the stormy-ish weather, but my hubby happened to look outside at just the right moment and saw a big fin sticking up right outside our house - yay! We watched from about 4pm until
4:35pm as it moved from our place (southern edge
Mariners Cove
) down into the happy meal mudflats before the rocks. It was moving veeeery slowly, feeding constantly (fin waving, swirling) and clearly not in a hurry to go anywhere. Finally, after over 30 minutes, it turned into the channel and headed out toward Camano. I lost it at that point because it started raining and I ran back inside and couldn't find it again in the choppy water. -Marianne Parry
