10:00 -
We were on the Puget Sound Express who saw it [
humpback
]! He was being elusive so we only saw him from a distance, but after that we got to experience a transient group of
Orcas - T18s,
2 females, 2 male children.... got to see a harbor porpoise kill, I caught a shot of him jumping behind the orca and also one of him being punted through the air by him! We left Port Townsend at 9am and saw them near
Smith Island
around 10. One surprised us and popped up directly on the port side near front of the boat!! …I got a pic right after of it starting to go down. What an amazing day it was, so beautiful!! One popped up right by the boat out of nowhere, and we don't know why the 1 separated and did that. I was shaking and had tears. It was near Smith Island. These creatures are incredible!! -Jessica Richter

15:30 - Gray on the West side of Polnell Point
, feeding very close to shore, not even high tide! -Suzanne Sewester
*
~

17:15 - Gray 2261
must have snuck past us in the northbound direction because it once again showed up southbound - it came right down the shore feeding close in along
Mariners' Cove
around 5-
5:30pm. Much more leisurely pace than earlier this afternoon, with loads of flipper waving and slow progress. It parked at the happy meal mudflats for a long time (prob 20 minutes or so) before slowly moving on toward Polnell. I can definitely confirm that I saw the white line…

14:30 -
We just had the most amazing sighting of
Gray2261
! He came screaming by
Mariners Cove
about
2:30pm (8/22/20), close to shore and heading toward Polnell. It fed a little bit here and there but was mostly rushing by. This is probably as close to a breach as I'll ever see from here - lol!

08:11 - Gray (prob 2261?)
spouting and on the move mid channel
between Mariners Cove and Utsalady
. Heading north. Love hearing that familiar "puff!" and finding our old friend out there. Have a great day! -Marianne Parry

Entry 5:
-

20:23 - (common dolphin) in Elliot Bay
. Right off of our dock at Pier 56. Didn't get any shots this time, unfortunately. Came right up next to the boat for a couple surfaces and then was gone into the night! -Joey LaMarche
*
Saw
Cinco
on Saturday just off of the
Edmonds
oil docks. He was headed west, swam next to my boat for half an hour. -Brian Coyle

Entry 6:
12:05 - Whale blow outside of Horsehead Bay at
12:05pm today. No fins. Possible grey? Unfortunately, we weren't close enough for good pictures at the second blow and that was the last one we saw. Did see a pectoral fin out of the water momentarily. Mignon Marie Whitaker
