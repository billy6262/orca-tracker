Orca Sightings for August 25, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait and Boundary Pass - ~

12:00 -
Several shots about 200 m off
south side of Saturna
taken about noon on Aug 25. Group of presumed transients heading west, under normal circumstances they would rapidly motor on. In this case they milled about in one location for several minutes. The source of attention appeared to be a large sea lion or seal (middle photo). Not sure but the orcas appeared to regard the mammal as a water toy rather than as food. There were perhaps 6 individuals in the group. -James McLarnon, Vancouver

We found the
T46's traveling with T137A and T137B
who are currently not traveling with their own pod. These Bigg's orca whales gave us an amazing experience as they came in close to the boat a few times while they traveled north in Haro Strait. …Sam, Island Adventures
*

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca (T46Bs)
- What an amazing day with Transient Killer Whales (T046B's and
Tl'uk T046B1B
) and
Humpbacks
everywhere! The orca is known as T046B1B to scientists but also goes by Tl'uk which comes from Indigenous Coast Salish language, translating to 'Moon.' The almost two-year-old orca was first spotted off Sooke, B.C. Vancouver Island by Paul Pudwell (me) in
November 2018. - Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal Explorations

Entry 3:
San Juan Islands (T46s, T137A, T1375B) -
Yesterday [8/25] we saw the T46s with T137A and T137B off
Reuben Tarte
, breaking our one-month drought of not seeing any dorsal fins - yahoo! I wanted to share this photo of T46E Thor because it demonstrates why it's very hard to diagnose "peanut head" from a single still image. Whenever photos are shared of the Southern Residents, it seems our abundance of concern about them leads us often to question the body condition of the whales in every picture we see. But single images, depending on the angle of the whale and the photographer and the behavior observed, can sometimes be very deceiving. It might be easy to conclude that T46E has an indentation behind his blowhole from this image. In fact, he is a very robust whale, seen here lifting his head as he comes to the surface to breathe. The fatty tissue around the head of the whale can bulge up when they do this, making it look somewhat like "peanut head", when in fact it's an extremely healthy whale! While we think of orcas as sleek animals, they do in fact have their lumps and bumps just like the rest of us. Depending on how they move, their bodies can take on different shapes that sometimes look odd when captured in a still photograph. Just something to keep in mind when looking at photos of any whale! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

11:10 - T046s north bound approaching Edwards Point/Landbank. T046E and T046F
traveled together with a third individual farther out. They were past me when I first heard them and may have been the trailing members of a group. Photographs taken from shore, cropped, very enlarged. Thanks! -Michelline Halliday,

While watching from Titlow they were under and around the bridge for a while and were very active with lots of tail slapping, splashing, and some breaching.
