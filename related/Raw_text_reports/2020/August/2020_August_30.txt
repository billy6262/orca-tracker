Orca Sightings for August 30, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient Killer Whales the (T046'Bs with Tl'uk)
again today! They were breaching, tail slapping, spy hopping all the while training the young how to hunt a poor seal...It was amazing! -Paul Pudwell,
Sooke
Coastal Explorations

Entry 2:
Haro Strait and San Juans
- I've always wondered when I was going to see the throes of a predation event with Bigg's. It's unfortunate for some of the harbor seals they snagged, but so interesting to watch the 9 year old male and 1 year old calf trying their hand at being the apex predators that they are. Just off
Stuart Island. These are the T65Bs

17:00 -
At about 5pm today, we saw no fewer than three
orca
on the south side of
Johns Island
. Given the number of vessels already there and number of people viewing from shore, it looked like they had been hanging out in the area for a while. We remained pretty far SW of the other boats and the orcas with our engine off. Around
5:30, they started cruising SW toward the kelp bed off the nearest SE point of Stuart Island. -Katrina Lassiter
