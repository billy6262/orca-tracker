Orca Sightings for August 6, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Puget Sound (T65As and T137s) -

20:30 -
They were moving very slowly, all grouped up, when we last saw them around
8:30, almost to the
tip of Maury
.

20:12 -
They are moving slowly, still across from
Redondo
.

19:47 - [orcas]
Approaching
Point Robinson
. Maury side, trailing the barge. -Steve Brown

20:00 -
We saw a number of orcas last night ~8pm on
Maury Island
. Our family has a beach shack, and these guys swam by about 25meters off shore. Super exciting. -Jon Baars
*

19:55 -
All passed
Pt. Robinson
, still spread in 3 groups, one group very close to shore, all favoring Vashon side, southbound. Beautiful sunset orcas.

18:54 - [orcas] Cleared Dilworth
, close to Vashon shores but some staring to cross to mid channel, traveling in three staggered groups, southbound. ---Here are some pics from the beautiful sunset pass by Vashon last evening. After a particularly rough week, it was truly salve to the soul. The close up pics of the two orcas with sun soaked dorsals are from Point Robinson, and the rest are from Dilworth. I arrived at Dilworth just in time to see T65a and family pass, only to see T65a2 and others off to my right hugging the shore out of camera reach. Missed the first group, darn it. I put my camera away, and started to step off the driftwood when I hear
*
poooosh!!
*
directly behind me, and out of the corner of my eye as I whip around, I see
T137a
surface super close to shore and sink back down as I frantically try to get my camera back out, only to have him reappear 5 minutes later, mid channel. I could not believe I missed him, rookie mistake!! I left without looking back down the channel, I know better than that!
*
facepalm So, determined to get him, I ran down to Point Robinson and caught him surface right off the Point, his beautiful sunset colored body rising up only once before another long dive. Ahhh. I can rest easy, now, lol!

SB, east side of Vashon, north of

17:48 - [orcas]
Slowly traveling S SE. With an occasional fluke in the air. Looks like they could be directly north of the north-end Vashon terminal, but it's hard to tell. -Ashley Whitman

Still in the same area, ferry traffic pushed them more towards the Seattle side, slowly moving south.

Looking at very southern end of Blake. We await their direction. About 6 to 8. We think two males, and baby/juvie...females. One spyhop. Very active swimming, forward and back. We'll hopefully have their direction after they clear large tree grove.

west side of Blake
, south end, swimming south. Huge jump in middle of channel. Others.... close to Blake's shoreline.

We're now on the beach,
between Southworth and Harper

Likely the same group (or part of the same group), now off the shore of
Port Orchard
, west of Blake Island. Close to shore. What looks to be a whale watching boat is nearby. Two have enormous fins. Males? We saw them about
4:00, they are still there [
16:27]. We estimate there are six individuals? Slowly working their way southeast.

15:00 -
We saw a large number of Orcas, possibly two pods traveling west past our home on the
south end of Bainbridge Island
. We are about 1/2 mile west of Restoration Point. The Orcas stopped briefly about a mile west of Restoration Point, near the base of Toe Jam Hill. We saw them just before
3:00 pm today, and were able to watch them for about 12-15 minutes. Today is Thursday
August 6th. It was thrilling to see them pass by! -Helen A Andrews

10:24 -
Pod of
orca between Indianola and Richmond Beach

06:45 -
Greetings all - a pod of approximately 5 whales on the
south side of Hat Island heading toward Mukilteo
, observed this morning around 0645. I do not have a very good camera but am including what I captured. I was torn between being present and enjoying the experience and trying to capture something for this group to use for identification. Maybe something here will be useful. The marine layer and fog made this a challenge. Have a beautiful day everyone. -Le Schneider

06:40 -

Entry 3:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

16:30 - Gray, Skagit Bay
heading toward Camano, 8/6/20,
16:30 I'm not sure if you want "distant" sighting reports, but here it is anyway. I noticed a whale watching boat (can't read lettering, but it's an aluminum-looking one, medium size) sitting out in the channel just north of Mariners' Cove so of course had to watch for spouts. I think I saw the white line on its head through binoculars, but I can't swear to it. It appears to be heading in the direction of Utsalady. I can't tell if it's feeding because it's not waving fins around like it does in shallow water. Updates to follow if I don't lose sight of it. Thanks! -Marianne Parry
