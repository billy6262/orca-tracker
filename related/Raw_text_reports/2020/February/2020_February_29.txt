============================================================

J31 and J56

Entry 2:
J-Pod on the west side of San Juan Island this morning
, we were fortunate enough to get to ride along with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching to collect more behavioral data on the Southern Residents. We spent most of our afternoon on the
Canadian side of Haro Strait
as the very spread out whales made their way north. While we only saw about 2/3 of the pod ourselves, all members were accounted for. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Oh my, what an amazing day yesterday with Island Adventures on their second trip of the year. Great job by Sam and the crew of finding and identifying the various members of the
J Pod
. It was a little wild at first as they were all over the place, very spread out. We encountered them near
Stuart Island
while heading North and spent all our time in the area around and past the lighthouse.
J42, J37, J38, J51 and J41, J42, J16
For sure
Cookie [J38] and Echo [J42]
were there, and I think
Tsuchi [J31] and J56 (Tofino??) Might be that Slick [J16]
was there too, among others. Did not see Onyx though. -David Haeckel
