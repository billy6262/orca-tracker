Attached are photos I took while I was at
Owen Beach
yesterday 2/9/20 at
2:00 pm. Right before this I saw two harbor porpoises while I was looking through my binoculars towards the
entrance to Commencement Bay
. I checked Orca Network and it said the orcas were visible near there, as well. Then this group popped up right at
2:01pm just to the right of me towards the boathouse (I had walked down the concrete walkway closer to where the boathouse and Anthony's are.), and not too far from shore. They hung around for a couple minutes, but by
2:06pm they disappeared back up Commencement Bay, I believe. There was also a second group of orcas that I saw around
2:25pm yesterday. While I was waiting in between seeing the two groups I also saw a male California sea lion hanging out right in front of the shore near me and several harbor seals, as well. -Sally Milligan-Smith

It was a great day to be at the park, sun was shining and the
Orcas
passed by. Viewing from
Pt. Ruston
around
2:00 pm, the pod of
about 8 went into Commencement Bay, T36B1, T36B2 & T36B.
They seemed to go slowly around the bay, lots of boats with them at this point. They seemed to get up to speed passing Pt. Ruston. The pod was all spread around and moving fast and not staying up long. -Desiree Sauve

I was able to get out in the sunshine and enjoy the company of the
T's, T99s
that passed through this morning, they sure were sneaky and hard to find! It was pretty cool watching them hunt as they
passed by Point Robinson
, so stealthy and quiet. At one point they had a seal trapped on a log boom out in the channel, but he somehow slipped away, lucky dude. Here are some pics as they briefly came near the shoreline. Such beauties! -Marla Smith
