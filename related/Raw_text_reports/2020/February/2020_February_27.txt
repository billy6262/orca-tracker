Entry 2:
16:39 -
That was intense! Seal tried for shore, they gave the smackdown and came inside the buoys here. It was amazing!!! Actually, seal did make it to shore.

16:30 - Hunting a seal.

16:25 - Huge breach
so cool!!!

16:20 - [orca] Circling off Shangri-La.
With my corgi buddy Poppy by my side, we set off looking for whales. We caught some distant glimpses as the two males,
T77A & T124C passed Fox Spit heading north
, so I decided to head to Shangri-La and hope for the best. I waited and waited and waited before spotting them. They slowly made their way north, mid channel and further away. I was getting ready to leave when all of a sudden they turned and started porpoising back towards me. They spent a lot of time circling off the pier at Shangri-La Shores, and then I could see the harbor seal they were hunting. The seal swam towards the shore trying to escape, bringing the orcas in closer and closer. The seal actually managed to get away! It was so exciting to watch this seal fight for his life as the two big boys circled close and tail smacked him. Poppy is officially my good luck whale charm. It's always been a dream of mine to see orcas hunt seals off Shangri-La so I could hardly believe it was happening today. -Rachel Haight

They appear to have turned back south now, at least from my perspective. "What a treat -
T77A and T124C
(both males) were in Saratoga Passage today - they were very far away - visible for a while, then did the disappearing act" -photo by Jill Hein -

16:35 -
My husband reports
tail slapping and lots of splashes
!

16:00 -
They took a 10 min downtime, then stopped to hunt it seems, still mid channel but much closer to Whidbey now, and they spread apart also. Straight across from Eagle Crest and under the Growler practicing take-offs and landing in Coupeville. I've got a few very distant photos to process.

15:43 - [orca]

14:20 - [orca]
From our perspective at
Hidden Beach
they are south of us under Mt Pilchuck, still
northbound Camano side. Two males.
Perfect viewing conditions for whale watching today, with flat calm seas and spring sunshine heralding reports of returning gray whales (the Sounders) and visiting orcas - what a combination of stealth, power and grace. Our sojourn at Hidden Beach, Whidbey, was rewarded by spotting
two male orcas in Saratoga Passage
as they passed Mt Pilchuck on their way north.
T77A
is one lucky whale! He has a somewhat checkered history having been caught up in fishing gear on two previous occasions,
November 2015 and
June 2018. Happy hunting boys, and stay out of trouble on your travels! -Sandra Pollard

Grey that came into Tramp Harbor
at sunset. He/she came into the shallows as the evening progressed, and we watched him forage until the light gave way. No fluke shots unfortunately, but some of that beautiful barnacled dorsal ridge and blowhole. Pretty darn sweet! -Marla Smith
