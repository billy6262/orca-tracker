BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -
JANUARY 23, 2020 - Center for Whale Research Encounter #1 (
T124s, T124C, T090s, T101s

Entry 4:
1412
they spotted fins and blows just
south of Trial Island
and began Encounter #01 for
2020
at 48 22.5/123 18.5. The first whales observed were
T124C and T124A3 with her first calf, T124A3A
. This trio was travelling quickly east in pursuit of a larger group approximately a half mile on. After quick proof of presence photos, the Mike 1 crew forged ahead to find the
T090s and T124As travelling in two mixed groups. T090C
was a few hundred meters to the north of his family travelling alongside
T124A and her youngest, T124A6, while T124A4 travelled with the rest of the T090s.
These whales were moving swiftly ESE into building southeast seas, but as they reached Middle Bank at 1520 the sea calmed and the group came together to stealthily snag a meal at 48° 24.5 N / 123° 07.9 W. The predation was quick; though no prey item was observed, the smell was faintly noticeable, a slick formed as some gulls picked up a few scraps and a short prey-share followed. The
T124A3s and T124C
did not join the predation, instead continuing ESE roughly .75 nm south of the group.
Meanwhile, a whale-watch vessel was departing a third group of killer whales, the
T101's, approximately 2.5 nm north west of the lead animals
. Please see Center for Whale Research website for full encounter and photos.

Hello, Those 2 whales we agree
CA26 and CA180
....CA26 is one of our oldest females and she lost her son many years ago so now often travels with other older females - "the golden girls" from one of our last sightings as she with 2 other older females and travel with no offspring. She has been with 180 and does mix around with other whales too since her son died as the 2 of them were always together....Thanks, Nancy Black, California Killer Whale Project (now official 501c3)
