Orca Sightings for January 18, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
14:59 - Possible Orca sighting in Salish Sea in between Eldridge Ave. and Portage Island! Saw from Eldridge Ave
. It looked to be
3 females
. 2 bigger and 1 smaller. I did not see the tell-tale big fin of a male. They were about
2/3 of the way to Portage Island/Lummi Peninsula
as seen from Eldridge Ave....sort of by a marker buoy. There was a boat about 300-400 yards away from them, (they moved away) and that's when I was more sure about what I saw and contacted you. I say probable because even with a telescope I'm not 100% sure. Still damned exciting! I mean, I can see whales from my window! -Jeremy Larsen

B.C. 425 pm. -Mitchell Nevi
