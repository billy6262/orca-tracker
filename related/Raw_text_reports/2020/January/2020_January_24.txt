Orca Sightings for January 24, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -
JANUARY 24, 2020 -
Members of J, K, & L pods (south from Yeomalt Point, Bainbridge Is. to Pt. Robinson, Vashon/Maury Is.) and CWR L pod encounter in Haro Strait
.
IDs on the SRKWs who were in Puget Sound last week,
January 2020, per Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research, from many photos forwarded and reviewed by CWR staff: "It was
J pod, K pod, and the 18 Ls (L pod minus the L12s and L54s
."
*
Hope this finds you doing well and enjoying the recent SRKW activity! Here are some pics from their
evening pass by Point Robinson
on Friday. The encounter was magnificent! They all came in so close to shore, it was like they were just pouring out of the northern fog bank headed straight for the beach, so magical indeed! I tried to get as many saddles as I could. Hoping they stick around before they head out for the season, crossing fingers they swing down to the south sound at least one more time!
K20, L72, L105.
Thanks again for your awesome updating, All the best. -Marla Smith

Entry 5:
L22s, L94s, L77s, L12s) in Haro Strait
.

13:40 -
A group of five whales were moving southwest in a tight group. They were backlit and the male was coming up at a slight angle so the whales were putting on a bit of an exotic look and Dave briefly dared to hope that he might have northern residents. But the male mostly looked like
L89
which is who he turned out to be and the whales were the
L22s and the L94s
. Not long after getting on the L22s and L94s, more whales showed up ahead of them pointed south. This was the
L77s plus L25 and L85
and they soon joined the L22s and L94s in one tight group of ten whales heading south-southwest. The whales were a bit un-cooperative at the beginning of the encounter and had lengthy long dives but got friendlier as the encounter went on. Last year's calf,
L124, looked good
and has a rather unique looking left saddle. Please see the Center for Whale Research website for the full Encounter #2 summary and photos.
