Orca Sightings for January 1, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
NORTHERN RESIDENTS -
A42 and A23 Northern Resident Orca
Jan 01 2020 - What a way to start 2020. Wanted to just get a few edits up I still need to make dinner! But Yukon and I lucked out with some help from our friends here locally and managed to spend time with the
A42s and A23s Northern Resident killer whales today off the south end of Quadra Island
! This is the first time personally I have been able to document the A23s here in the Winter. As you can see they were all quite a social bunch! Thankful for the day as it looks like the rest of the week will be spent hunkered down from the weather!... More edits from our amazing encounter with the Northern Residents on Jan 1st. Cant help but to hope that these guys are down here for a good reason and that they are finding Chinook in these old fishing areas for them. A clan Northerns tend to spend more time than other Northerns in the upper Gulf of Georgia. I have heard through the grapevine that the local winter Chinook fishing is very good off places like Shelter Point and The Hump off Cape Mudge. Right on the path of the NR's as the travelled from the South tip of Quadra in a big loop past both of these grounds. Let's hope that these guys and their Southern counterparts are finding what they need for a winters feast.
