Orca Sightings for May 4, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Mon,

Entry 2:
Northern California Coast -

12:53-

18:00 -
Monday, 4 May,
off of Eureka
. Left them about
7 nmi SSW of Trinidad Head
, still all scattered in subgroups. I did get some scales from a fish kill by K33, heard crunching on hydrophones, a fair bit of chasing and milling. Some long dives too, depths of 200-300', no wonder we weren't catching any halibut.
Present in photos were:
K4's: 37, 22, 33
K13's: 20, 38, 34 (would 13 be off with 27 and 44?)
K14's: 14, 26, 42, seems that 36 would should be in the mix too... ??
Who else might have been there that we didn't find? -Jeff Jacobsen
K37, K22, K38, K26

Entry 3:
San Juan Islands (T123s) -

15:28 -
They just spent 1.5 hours on a Steller at
Reuben Tarte
but it got away! They are now westbound through Spieden [Channel].

Entry 4:

As we worked on the boats earlier this week a friend alerted us to whales in the harbor and we dropped everything to see who it was. Just to the north we found one of our favorite families, the
T123s
. This family of four is one we see regularly and after several weeks of being off the water it felt good to be out there again. The whales cruised
up San Juan Channel
and it wasn't long before the hunt was on! The whales had found a Steller sea lion. The hunt took over an hour and the sea lion continue to defend itself until it reached a small bay near Reuben Tarte park. Even as the whales continued their assault the sea lion moved in shore and into the shallow bay. Eventually, as the sea lion got close to shore, the whales abandoned the hunt and continue on their way. Did the whales allow the sea lion to get away or was it simply lucky enough to get into waters too shallow for the whales to want to follow?
T123 "Sidney" and T123A "Stanley"
had both stranded previously so perhaps they were simply wary of the shallow water. We will never know for sure, but it's fun to speculate! The sea lion was a branded individual and so some of our friends were able to provide further information about the
adult male Steller. His brand is 183R
and he was originally branded for tracking purposes off the Oregon Coast. He's 18 years old and with an average lifespan of 20 years 183R is definitely an old, mature bull. He's been seen for the past decade here in the San Juan Islands hauled out at Whale Rocks and Green Point. He escaped this encounter and we're hoping we'll see him again in the future.

I believe this is the
pod of transient Orcas including the grey-white calf Tl'uk
. Observed at least one male, three females, and a calf.
The pod was moving north
, at a medium pace, approximately
100-150 yds off Lagoon Pt
. on the west side of Whidbey Island. Photos were taken from the beach looking west toward Marrowstone Pt. and Pt. Wilson. Some tail slapping. [This batch, T46Bs, T128. Some posted to our FB page has T125A, as well.

18:08 -
At around
6:08 pm tonight we observed a good-sized
pod of Orcas swimming by Lagoon Point
, Greenbank, Whidbey Island. They were very close to shore, maybe coming within 30 feet as they rounded Lagoon Point. There were a couple of little guys making tale slaps and one large orca with a notch on its dorsal fin. One of the younger little guys looks pale gray in some of the photos which makes me think he might be the little white orca we have heard so much about. See image below! Hard to tell if it is just the lighting. Very exciting! In some of the photos you can see Fort Flagler across the water.

15:03 -
Carolyn Berry called to report
orcas near Port Ludlow
been circling for at least 1/2 hour to hour.
6 that we see
, 2 males one with big notch in fin and the white one with them. Spyhopping and tail slapping. Last we saw they were southbound then headed back north, between Port Ludlow and Twin Spit, Hansville. Not moving very fast. Seen by a lot of people from water and shore.

I spotted 4 this afternoon about
2 miles North of the Hood Canal Bridge
around 3 PM on 5/5. I got one really poor picture while coming off of plane and going into neutral. They were transiting North. -Russell Avocato

Just spotted a
pod of Orcas in the Hood Canal
heading north towards bridge, on the Kitsap side of the canal. -Lesie Boyd

13:00 -
I think I can report a sighting of a
transient pod in Hood Canal off Driftwood Key, Hansville
, on
May 4 about 1pm. They stayed for about an hour. Being new to this, there seemed to be
7-8 members, 2 large bulls
(one with a very large notch out of the dorsal), several females and "the gray baby". -Jim Fasano

12:50-

14:00 - This afternoon in Hood Canal between Twin Spits and Tala Point
. Tl'uk and 8 more orcas were playing around. Our location and our kayak path is in yellow started at
12:50pm and we started heading back home at around 2pm"

Some of the
T46Bs visited Hood Canal
! The white baby,
Tl'uk
, was with them. It shows up clearly in the first video, right at the beginning. Just before the black dorsal. They started near the
mouth of the Coon Bay Harbor and slowly moved NW
. They were around for 2+ hours. -BryAnn Bingham

Mon,

Entry 6:
Hood Canal (T65As) -

10:00 -
Hi! A group of
5-6 orcas
passed my home at approx 10 AM on the
Hood Canal heading South
. I live approximately 4-6 miles south of Bangor Base via the waterfront. I've attached pictures that include what I could get of their markings. One of them seemed very large with a tall dorsal fin, another looked like a possible juvenile. There was a bald eagle that circled them as well for a bit, thinking that could maybe mean they were chasing some salmon? Thanks for all you guys do!
T65As
Cheers, Ali Carson

May 4, late afternoon, heading slowly south about a mile south of the Jefferson/Mason county line.
Pod of 4
, including one very small one. Sadly, they were closer to the other side of the canal, but was able to get a few pictures anyway.

I live on the water at Big Beef in Seabeck. On the morning of Monday,
May 4, 2020 my girlfriend and I spotted orcas across the Canal in Dabob spouting and jumping. Later that afternoon we got in my boat to look for them. We found them on the east side of the canal a little North of Holly in the Lilliwaup area. There were
6-7 whales
. They were in process of killing a seal. We got too close and my girlfriend was taking a video when the aggressively encircled my 18' Bayliner. A large male also went under and rubbed against the hull. It was exhilarating and very scary. We have many pictures and videos and would be happy to share our experience with any scientists etc. it was fascinating. -photos by Charlie Feinstein -

Mon,
May 4, Northern Saratoga Passage - My wife and I were kayaking today @
Polnell Point, in Oak Harbor
, when this Gray Whale popped up and scared the daylights out of us! It sped by and didn't hang around at all, bypassing the cove in Polnell Pt., where they often feed. From my iPhone photos. Sorry we didn't get any better pictures. Thank you! -photos by Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA

08:35 -
Hi again, there's a second grey now,
8:35am, about mid-channel, halfway between Camano and Whidbey, headed towards Polnell Pt.

08:06 -
Looks like it's headed to Skagit Bay, closer to Camano Is.

07:43 -
Milling around but appears to be headed toward Mariners Cove.

06:45am reporting a single grey whale between Polnell Pt. and Mariners Cove WI.
Glassing from Harrington Lagoon so tooo far for any pictures. -Erik Anderson

Mon,

Entry 10:
Southern Saratoga Passage
- Looking through my photos, there is another thing I found interesting. The morning of
May 4, 2020, I took a number of low tide photos of the whale feeding pits. As I've been looking at them more closely, I've noticed a pattern I've never seen before. See the photo attached. In addition to the usual feeding divots, there seems to be a pattern that looks like the gray whale was using both its pec fins as a balance on the sand as it reached down forward to take a bite! Note the smaller divots on either side of the main divot on all 5 feeding pits??? gray whale feeding pits photo by Barbara Brock -

16:30 -
Monday,
May 4 about
4:30 PM 2 gray whales put on quite a show for the neighborhood. The tide was in, and the whales were feeding in shallow water right below the bluff. They fed very vigorously for quite some time. The vigorous feeding, and close proximity to the bluff and vegetation, made it challenging to take ID photos. -photos by Barbara Brock -

Entry 12:
10:00 - We had more grey whales in Port Susan sound this morning,
May 4th. At about 10 AM they were going north. There were 3. 2 went as far as Kayak Point and appeared to be foraging. One turned around and came by our place on East Camano heading out of the sound. We have watched for most of the day but did not see the others return. We probably just missed them. -Terri and Tom Smith, South East Camano Island.
