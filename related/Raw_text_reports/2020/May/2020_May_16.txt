Entry 3:
Near Anacortes, WA -

08:43 -
Hello. We encountered an Orca Pod yesterday, 16 May @
8:43 am
traveling from James Island, across the Rosario Strait to Washington Park, Anacortes
. We had overnighted and the weather turned nastier than expected so we headed home early-and how fortunate we were because we saw this wonderful
pod of 5-7 Orcas
. - We first saw the Orcas in the distance with a small boat stopped and near-we also saw a very large freighter approaching and were concerned for the Orcas so sent a sighting report to "Whale Alert" app. - Once we safely crossed the path of the freighter, we put the engine in idle from afar to watch the action (a ferry, freighter and several smaller boats) - We were pleased to see the huge freighter stop for nearly 20-30 minutes while the Orcas swam (possibly feeding) in front of the freighter. Then they started to move off looking like they were coming our way! - I turned my phone video on to catch-them and then they surfaced near us!....it was amazing! We did not follow and did our best to video but it was pretty rough. - It looked as if there were 5-7 and one huge finned one (hopefully easy to ID) on the left and at least one baby. - Any info you can give would be great and hopefully this information will help in the ID and research of these magical Orcas. Thank you for your continued efforts to save and take care of these wonderful beings. -Best Wishes, Erica Montgomery and Andrew Power - photos by Erica Montgomery -

Entry 8:
Northern California Coast -
My wife (Julie Kelly) braved the rain and saw these orcas today off
Patrick's Point in Humboldt County, CA.
There were
at least 4
of them splashing around for about an hour. We wonder if they are part of the pod seen off Eureka on
May 4 by Jeff Jacobson. -Mike Kelly - photos by Julie Kelly -

Entry 10:
Strait of Juan de Fuca -
I thought I would share some good news. I accidentally stumbled upon
two (possibly three) Grey whales
feeding in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca off Shipwreck Point on the Olympic Peninsula
. I forwarded these photos to Alie Perez with Cascadia Research, who has confirmed neither of these whales are a match to our NPS Grey -hales or has an official designation/ID. This made my day when I got out of my car at the beach to discover these feeding Grey whales. -Britt P. - photos by Brittany Philbin -

Entry 11:
Hood Canal -

16:00-

16:30 -
One seen about
a mile and one half south of HC bridge
. It was out about 300 ft. off the west shore. Surfaced and spouted for about 15 minutes, and then disappeared. -Bill Boston

Entry 12:
Port Susan -
Yay, Saturday treat!! Just had a large
solo gray whale
swim by our place here on
Sunny Shores Rd in Tulalip
. Heading up into the shallows about 100 meters off shore. They always seem to head into the shallows on our shore and out on the Camano shoreline. Must be due to the way the currents and tides swirl as the Port Susan bath tub fills and empties. Tide is currently flooding. -Dougie B, Sunny Shores Rd., Tulalip

SPECIES UNCONFIRMED - Sat,

Entry 13:
Strait of Juan de Fuca -

15:00 -
Today roughly around
3:00 pm we spotted
a small group of whales or porpoises
traveling west from our view
from Ediz Hook
facing north! At least two dark dorsal fins and what seemed a spy hop amongst the group. I've checked several websites but nothing recorded yet. Any ideas what these amazing mammals were? -Madigan Winters
