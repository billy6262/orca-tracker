Orca Sightings for May 8, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait (T101s)
- Center for Whale Research Encounter #26: "... Dave was on the phone with Ken to report who the whales were when
T101B
suddenly surfaced right beside the boat and began riding the bow. Dave turned the boat off and T101B began milling in the area right off Bellevue Point. And then T101B came back to the boat and decided to hang out right beneath it again while he waited for the others. He surfaced once on either side of the boat but went back to hanging underneath it. This went on for about a minute before
T101B shot off as T102
passed. ..." See CWR Encounter #26 for full encounter summary and photos.
