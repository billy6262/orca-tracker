GRAY WHALES - Sun,

Entry 2:
17:59 - The two grays are between Everett and Hat Island
this evening. I was going to say that they need some protection from the boaters that were approaching them, but a large white cabin cruiser is now approaching those boats and must be asking them to stay back. I have been seeing a couple other boats sitting with them recently at an appropriate distance so there are protectors other at times. -Greg Heiss

On Sunday
May 24th, saw
one Gray Whale from Possession Pt. State Park
, much closer to the Mukilteo side than the Clinton side. It wasn't blowing it's hole that hard and barely was peeking it's mid section out of the water. Moving at a pretty slow pace. We think there was a baby with it, however it was hard to tell as it was quite a ways. The whale was heading south. -Christa Canell
