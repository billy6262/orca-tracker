Orca Sightings for May 6, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
a small pod of Orcas
last night (2020-May-06) in the
Harbor of Gibsons BC - Howe Sound
. The small pod of Orcas appeared to be 3 or 4 individuals, with one appearing to be pretty young. We captured a short video clip via a iPhone - not that great, but it is what we had on us at the moment to try and capture this moment. -Cheers, Tim Rockford

Hello, we have a house on
Davison Head Drive on SJI and saw 4 Orcas swim by
at
6:30 this evening. They were in
Spieden Channel
about 150 feet offshore of Davison Head. A second group were about 200 yards past the first group- closer to Spieden Island. Could only see 2. -Thanks, Mary Anne Butcher

17:15 -
brief glimpse of
orcas northbound off Smuggler's Cove
(west side San Juan Island) and then they disappeared around the corner-
maybe 3 or 4 animals
based on the blows heard. -Barbara Howitt

11:30 -
Hello! We have
a gray or humpback just north of Sunnyside Beach in Steilacoom
. First sighted about
11:30 am today (5/6). Seen surfacing 3 times in very choppy water close to the shore. We live on the hillside above, and our view of the shoreline is screened by trees and houses, but we got a close enough look to confirm that it's a gray or humpback. It seems to be feeding and not heading in a specific direction at this time. -Tari Norris, Steilacoom

11:28 -
Hello! While out for a walk in
Steilacoom, WA
, we spotted a whale spout and saw the body at the surface at
11:28am. We were too far to see much to determine if it was a grey or a humpback whale. I did have binoculars. The whale was moving north and was just south of the Anderson Island ferry terminal. We followed it moving northward until we lost sight of it spouting just past the Chamber's Bay Golf Course. It wasn't too far from the shore as it was moving. It was low tide as well. It seemed to be moving very quickly and it was traveling alone. Thanks for keeping track of all the whales and doing all you do to protect them. -Diann Sheldon
(5/8 update from Diann: "I thought it was
a gray whale
by what we could see of its body. It is always a treat to be in the right place at the right time to catch them!!)
