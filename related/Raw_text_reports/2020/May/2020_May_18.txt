Hi -- I just found your site last night while we were researching the whale pod we spotted off Orcas Island last night, and wanted to report the sighting.
Small pod (appeared to be a couple of females, one male, and one or two babies) off the NE shore of Orcas Island, moving east from Point Thompson to Buckhorn Bay
. Spotted them around
7:30pm, and they stayed in view for more than 2 hours. Attached video shows one of the babies porpoising out of the water -- quite a sight! -Scot Devereaux

Entry 5:
Admiralty Inlet -

17:16 - [gray]
About 10 minutes ago in front of the
Bush Point Lighthouse
. I only have the one picture. It came up 5 times, before my neighbor called me over. That was the only time I saw it. Neighbors said it was headed north, then turned around to south and did that a few times. Then it went under and we didn't see it -Marlene Norton Naughton - photo by Marlene Norton Naughton
