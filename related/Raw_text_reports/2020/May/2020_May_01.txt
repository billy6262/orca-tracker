============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia - ~

17:30 -
Hi. Reporting a sighting in the
Malaspina Straight just past Powell River, BC
,

Entry 2:
5:30 pm. I believe it's a transient pod based on online info. The largest male has a distinctive curved dorsal fin. They approached within 5 meters of our sailboat while feeding, we think. I have other photos, etc., but these are closer shots.

Entry 3:
Strait of Juan de Fuca/Discovery Bay (T46Bs) -

20:00
- Greetings! Last evening,
May 1st, around 8pm, I saw
2 groups of orcas
. They were in an area of the
Strait of Juan de Fuca between the Miller Peninsula, aka Diamond Point, and Protection Island
. Probably a total of 10 in all. Just a guess. -Carol Tangwall

Friday evening, we saw
at least 6 orcas
very close (100 yards) to shore. The white one was one of them. They sure looked like they were fishing, but I understand they only eat mammals. Anyway, they stayed in front of the house [at
Diamond Point
] for at least half an hour, with four of them mostly staying together. Swam into Discovery Bay and then back out, which is when they hung out by the house. -Dr. Kelly Watson

16:15-

20:15 - A pod of orcas came into Discovery Bay
. There was only one with a huge dorsal fin, about 4 medium sized and about 4 or 5 smaller. I did not see the white baby but someone at head of bay got a picture of it. There were maybe 9 or 10 in the pod. They headed south to end of bay and then left about

8:15 -
8:30 heading out
towards Protection Island
. They were traveling medium speed going into bay and leaving. Spouting and rolling as they entered but no breaching. I have never seen that many in the bay at one time so it was exciting. -Karel Reeves

Several groups of orcas, estimated at
10-12 individuals
, were heading into
Discovery Bay
yesterday,
May 1st, around 4 in the afternoon, and came back out about
7:30. The large male stayed out in the deeper water, and two separate groups did a closer pass. One of the groups had
Tl'uk
and another younger orca in a tight group. On their way out, several pushed bait into shore and surfaced 20 ft. off shore. There was a large male visible about a mile offshore. We've been having regular sightings every 10 -14 since late February.

Hello just wanted to share that we saw

Hi, between
12:30 and
1:15 PM on

Entry 4:
4 orcas were observed SE of Guemes Island, between Huckleberry and Saddlebag islands
, just west of Padilla Bay. They were moving slowly and quite separated at times, changing directions as if feeding and not appearing to be in a rush. Three bald eagles and some seagulls swooped down several times as if looking for scraps. There was one large orca, one medium and two smaller fins. Two other boats were in the area, but all kept a good distance. I was thinking, that during this period of less boat traffic, they must be enjoying the quiet. I stopped my engine and depth sounder. The pictures below are with a 10 x zoom, so I was not as close as you might think. They gradually came together as a group and headed south along Hat island, towards the Swinomish Slough, and were lost from my view. Although close to Anacortes, I did not see them head for the Guemes Channel, which would be the most open way to return to more open waters. In 30 years of boating out of Anacortes, this is only the third time I've seen orcas this far in. [anonymous report] unID'd Bigg's KWs. -photos by anonymous reporter -

Entry 5:
Bellingham Bay/Chuckanut Bay -

09:00 -
This morning at about 0900, we observed
a group of three, plus a fourth
about 100 yards ahead of the three. All were at the mouth of
Chuckanut Bay
, about 0.2 mile WNW of Chuckanut Island. Our location was from our window on Chuckanut Drive, about 0.9 mi from the whales. The sighting lasted only a few minutes and consisted of 3-4 breechings and blows. Given the proximity to many homes and boats, perhaps you received additional sightings? -Thanks, PN

15:30
- Between
3:15 and
3:30 today,

Entry 7:
3 orca
passed us by. One male and two others. They were smaller than the male, and of the two, one was smaller than the other. Lindsey Beach, on Dabob Bay (off of the north end of Hood Canal, near Quilcene). They had evidently been up the bay. They were headed south back towards Hood Canal. At this same location, we saw 4 orca, 1 male, 3 others, 1 a lot smaller, on
March 24, 2020. -Marvin S.

GRAY WHALES - Fri,

Entry 8:
Hood Canal -
Heard from a few on the south shore of Hood Canal that there appears to be a baby with the
gray whale
that has been there for a few weeks. I have images of the adult. Haven't seen a calf. -Teri King

Fri,

Entry 9:
Northern Saratoga Passage
- Hi, I saw a
grey whale
while kayaking under 100m from the shore north of the mouth of
Mariner's Cove
. It was headed north. It was huge (over 30') and covered in barnacles at the nose. It was kind of playing around for a bit, it seemed. It turned a few times, and we saw a pectoral fin circle through the water. I hope this info helps. -Ty Tuin

13:10 -
Got a call from MaryJo Adams; she again observed a
gray whale in Crescent Harbor
today around
1:10 pm. Someone else she talked to there said they had seen two, but she only observed one during the time she was there. It was over toward
Polnell Point
. She tried to get photos, but due to distance and sun she doesn't think they will turn out, but will send them if they do. (-sb)
