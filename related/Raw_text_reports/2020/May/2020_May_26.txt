Entry 1:
Bellingham Bay (T46Bs, T123s) -

20:13 -
There was just a pod of orcas in the
Bellingham Channel
. They hung out just south of the Cypress fish pens for a good long time. It was hard to see how many there were without binoculars from Guemes, but it seemed as though there were 5 or 6. -Libby Hinds Boucher
*

19:30 - About 4 Orca headed south in Bellingham Channel between Cypress and Guemes [Islands]
. They hung around for quite a while near the former fish pens (the ones that collapsed and let loose all the Atlantic Salmon a couple years ago). -Kurt McCloud

According to reports and photos on NextDoor, there were
two adults and two baby orca in Bellingham Bay
late yesterday afternoon (around 5 p.m.?). One of the babies was white. Someone on NextDoor said they were transient orcas. Hope this helps! -Virginia Herrick, Bellingham

I have photographs of
about 8 Orcas near the Nooksack River mouth
. One is that
young white orca T46B1B "Tl'uk"
. I'm shooting from Bellingham on the bluff above Boulevard Park with a 500mm lens. The whales are about 1.6 miles from me. There was one big male in the group. They headed wsw out of the bay around
13:00. Let me know if you want any more details. These photos were taken from over 1.5 miles away. -photos by Brad Wellman

11:40 - Female orca & two babies sited in Bellingham Bay off Boulevard Park
, heading north. Very active. Report received from a friend at 1140am today. "I got to see them for about 5 min from the beach near the old Mt Baker Plywood factory... what a treat! They were full of beans! Breaching, slapping their tails etc. it looked like there was one large whale with 3 or 4 babies... someone said they were the J pod..." Per text from a friend. -Marcia Kolinski

A U.S. Coast Guard Station Bellingham boat crew was conducting training in
Bellingham Bay when a pod of orcas
appeared! The crew was underway conducting a coxswain check-ride for a qualifying member. #TrainingTuesday. "During a training mission we saw the whales and stayed off 300 yards, and 400 yards from their toward direction. We came to all stops and secured the engines", crewmember BM1 Roy Hawes said. "The whales seemed to have decided to check us out, and came by the boat before heading to deeper water." The Coast Guard reminds all mariners to STAY VIGILANT and #BeWhaleWise on the water! Follow all laws and regulations, particularly when encountering portected wildlife. (More info here: https://www.bewhalewise.org/)

This morning, Tues.
May 26, we were setting out from Bellingham to go to Anacortes and heard someone over the radio tell us that there were
Orcas outside the entrance to Squalicum waterway
. We turned right in our motor vessel (Rangertug 31) and crept over there to see
at least 5 whales
, one large and four small moving around off the Squalicum Beach. It is my first sighting of whales so I am very excited. No good pictures to share with you, but there was a fishing trawler hanging out and two people in kayaks watching from a distance. Maybe one of them got a good shot. -Merle Silverman

Admiralty Inlet (T137s). ~

19:00 -
I spotted this
pod of 4 orcas
Tuesday around 7pm while returning from Smith Island. When I saw them, I was inside the minimum distance so I just shut my boats engine off and zoomed way in with my phone to take this video. The location was
1/2 mile north of Pt. Wilson
, and the pod was heading west. -Mike Myers

This [video] was about 4pm
May 26th in
Port Townsend
. We were standing on the pier and were completely surprised and amazed. They were headed northwest. We watched them all the way to the lighthouse at Ft. Worden. It was quite the surprise as we were resting on the pier from a bike ride. We had been there more than 5 minutes when we heard the blows. They were so close! The pier quickly got crowded and we went on to the point to watch them head out. -Kim Farris Peck

COASTAL KILLER WHALES - Tue,
May 26 - Oregon Coast - Video - OSP Troopers had a close encounter of the Orca kind, while on boat patrol

UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - Tue,

GRAY WHALES - Tue,

Entry 7:
20:41 - (3) Grey whales in Birch Bay
, Washington, going on 45 mins now. -Gerald Patterson
*

19:15 - [gray]
Whale spouts visible from shore looking out to the middle of
[Birch] Bay
. We thought about eight spouts in the 15 minutes we watched. It seemed to basically stay in about the same area as it has been from other reports in the last few weeks. Only the back was seen as it did a slow surface roll. No fin or tail seen. Second hand report by another watching that they saw this Saturday, as well. 1 boat relatively close watching and one kayaker. Both seemed respectful of the whale's presence. From my perspective the photo with the boat was not even aware the whale was near it for a period of time. I'd reported this yesterday with a
6:00pm time. It was actually closer to
7:15pm. The whale did nothing too interesting other than blow, roll and disappear. Maybe 8 blows in the 15 minutes we watched. -photos by Eric Ellingson

Entry 8:
Possession Sound -

12:00 -
Around noon I encountered
3 gray whales off SE Hat Island
. The first whale was traveling slowly north over deep water and did not appear to be actively feeding. [Two] whales were both actively feeding in the same general area. It was a very low, -2ft tide, so the feeding was very visible on the surface. It included some nice spy hops and fin waves. I identified one as #44 Dubknuck, a new whale for me. [Two of the photos are of] flukes that show during feeding. -photos by John Judy -

Entry 9:
[
CRCID44 "Dubknuck", CRCID22 "Earhart"
Per Alie Perez, Cascadia Research Collective: 3rd whale is an unknown.
