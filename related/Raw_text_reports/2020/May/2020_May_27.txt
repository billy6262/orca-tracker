SPECIES UNCONFIRMED - Wed,
May 27 - Boundary Pass - Today we observed a couple humpback whales between Pender and Moresby. We also observed a
very very large whale traveling east along the Canada border, Boundary Pass south of Pender
. I have only ever seen a fin whale once before up at Haida Gwaii a few years ago while on a charter excursion. This whale today
appears to be a Fin
. It didn't have the structure of a Gray as it definitely had a prominent curved dorsal fin. This whale was very long in length, dark upper body. It was traveling East along the surface then below. We did not get to see the tail. Has there been any confirmed sightings? -Ray Andrews
