Hi all! Tonight at
Lincoln Park
, saw a breach and a few spouts looking southwest past the Fauntleroy Ferry. Not sure what type of whale it was, but thinking maybe a humpback? it was definitely a breach, and it was a bit far but appeared to be heading northwest (up and around the northern most point of Vashon). Anyone here that was in the area at the time and maybe has insight? (I'd say it was between 7-
7:30pm). I moved to Seattle from upstate NY just under 3 years ago and this is my first (and very anticipated!!) whale sighting! it was a great evening for sure :) -Brittany Bowhall

Entry 3:
San Juans -

19:54 - Headed out of cove towards Eagle Point
now. Looks youthful and playful, whitest fluke I've ever seen!

19:37 - Beautiful humpback whale at Eagle Cove
right now, very close, inside the mouth of cove! Did a mini cartwheel and caught Blake's eye, and twice sailed his/her fluke high! Looks solid white underneath! We have had bait balls really close in to shore lately, perhaps that explains the visit! (Hmmmm...Possibly two) -Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill

GRAY WHALES - Sat,

Entry 4:
Birch Bay -

20:52
- Krista Hammer called. She's viewing from a waterfront house on Birch Bay Village. They first heard and then saw a whale, probably
gray whale
, who was deep into the middle of the bay out from the Bay Market, in quite shallow water, thought to be feeding, but she didn't have her binoculars. Also saw a/same whale this morning at
8:30 as well as last couple of days. Talked with a neighbor who was told maybe a baby. Krista thought, as she has seen two, one is shorter than another. Whale reported to have been there a few days, and in general, been seeing
grays
for past couple of weeks. So frequent thinks might be same whale. Of concern, a jet skier was out all over the bay; concerned might hit them and following them around, etc. Hoping enforcement could come out to protect the whales. [Be Whale Wise information provided to Krista- alb]

Message from Krista Hammer saying they have seen the
gray whale in Birch Bay the last 3 days
, the last sighting this morning at
8:30. She said others have said they think it has a baby with it, and they MAY have seen what looked like a 2nd back of a whale when watching it with binocs. She is concerned because now there is a jet skier out there, and she wants to know if someone can come and guard the whale.
