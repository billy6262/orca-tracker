Orca Sightings for May 11, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mon, Tue 11 -
Cattle Pass to Spieden Channel (T123s) -

20:23 - West End of Spieden Channel
,
8:23pm, T123A Stanley. We were all alone out there as the storm approached at
9:00ish. It was a typical Monday filled with the sort of things that wear the mind down. As the zoom meetings persisted, I watched whale reports come in with multiple pods of Bigg's Orcas (mammal eating orcas) and humpbacks swimming through the San Juan Channel (just a few hundred yards away as the raven flies from where I sat). The work day slipped into a beautiful stormy night when @orcawatcher (Monika Shields) sent in an update that the T123s just swam west into Spieden Channel...right towards our docked boat.
This scenario was lining up to everything I have dreamed: Last drop of daylight, rolling storm clouds and apex predators. Snow McCormick and I gathered the pups, our backpacks and cameras and hopped in Holdfast, our tiny boat, to try our luck. The ominous weather looked heavy upon us as we scanned the horizon for Stanley, the 20yr old male Bigg's orca. I'm not sure of the exact dimensions of Stan the Man, but full-grown male orcas are 25feet in length and weigh 12K lbs, so if we to spot the pod from afar he was the one whom we were to see first with his massive dorsal fin.
After a bit of scanning, his enormous 6ft fin appeared above the water line approximately 1,000 yards off the bow. We slowly moved towards the group as they all dove down. Silently we waited and powered down the motor looking towards the horizon thinking we were still a good 500 yards from where we thought they would come back up.....we were wrong. Not three feet from the boat
T123, "Sidney" the matriarch herself
, surprised us with a big blow that made me jump backwards a foot. Picture a dinosaur creeping up behind you and yelling "BOO!!!" I am so grateful my camera was strapped to me because it very well could have fallen into the drink. After I regained my footing, Snow said, "They are going to swim under the boat! Look down!" I quickly looked over the inflatable tube and
inches below the surface was Stanley looking back up at us
slowly slipping beneath our toes. It was a mix of adrenaline and butterflies seeing this King Predator gazing up at us at such incredibly close proximity. We remained shut down as the whole pod swam around our boat, sometimes swimming back at us like Stanley pictured here.
At one point they even caught a harbor porpoise for a late dinner (Snow has a picture of them tossing it at one point). After the sky turned to ink, the T123s headed north and we bobbed under the rain filled clouds that decided they were not going to be patient for one instant longer. The water fell from the skies as we docked the boat silently pondering the life altering experience that had just occurred.
We went to sleep that night with Orcas swimming through our dreams...literally. When I woke, I really wasn't sure which part was reality...meeting them on the surface or freediving with them all night. It is inherently human to want to experience this again, but I can honestly say...I'm good. I am so honored the T123s wanted to hang with us for that magical twilight hour and I hope they know we will do whatever it takes to make sure their population stays as healthy as it is today.

Thanks to Alex Shapiro for alerting me to
killer whales outside Mineral Point, north toward Ruben Tarte
. Family composition looks like
T123's
again. -Alan Niles

14:30 - Killer Whales through Cattle Pass. Guess: T123s
. Hung out around Whale Rocks for 45 minutes, back and forth between the islands. Large male seen; fairly young orca also seen. Too far off for a good ID. -Dante Aubert - photos by Dante Aubert -

Entry 4:
Bellingham Channel - ~

20:15-

20:20 -
Joanne Gray called to report that she and her husband Michael observed
at least 2-3 orcas from their home on the NW side of Guemes Island
(Indian Village area) ~

8:15-
8:20pm Monday,
May 11th. They look west and estimates the pod was approximately 1/2 way
between Cypress Head and Eagle Harbor, Cypress in Bellingham Channel
. She first saw at least a dorsal rising which caught her attention, then a few minutes later, the same or another whale (a male) surfaced and they could see the dorsal and back surface further to the north. Pod was traveling at medium pace northbound.

Entry 6:
Hood Canal - ~

12:00-

13:00 -
Good afternoon. We wanted to let you know that we spotted
three orcas near the Sund Rock area of Hood Canal
today (
May 11, 2020) at approximately 12 to 1 p.m. We observed them from the deck of our house, which is set approximately 150 to 200 feet above the water. We saw
three clear orca dorsal fins
. They rose together in the water and spouted water from their blowholes. If it's helpful to know, they were heading north. This was our first orca siting after living in the Pacific Northwest for a long time, so we are excited to share this news with you. -Best, Annu Mangat & Dale Cotton

Brad Hanson, NOAA/NWFSC, sent text he just had 2nd hand report that
Hood Canal whales were up in Dabob Bay headed north

Mon,

Entry 7:
North Puget Sound/Deception Pass (T101s).

18:00 - At least 2 orcas were swimming in our bay
, past Strawberry Island and heading west towards the Deception Pass Bridge at about
6:00 pm this evening. What a thrill! -Diane Parham - photos by Diane Parham -

Entry 8:
*

17:45 - 3 or 4 Orca
, first sighted moving east, just off Ben Ure Island. Watched them in the channel for about 15 min. Last seen as they circled closer to the
Fidalgo side
, heading west. Kept watch for several min, but they didn't reappear. So assume they
continued west under the bridges
. Always a thrill to see, and surprised to see this close to the pass. But there are good fishing holes under those currents!

phone call:

Emily Mamales called she is aboard her boat Patience anchored in
Cornet Bay by Ben Ure Island
. She just watched
at least 3-4 orcas, including male, playing in the channel 1st closer to Deception
, circling, then moved over much closer to Fidalgo. They may have gone through Canoe Pass vs Deception. -Emily Mamales - photo by Emily Mamales -

Hello! These (maybe two of them, maybe 3?) came by North to South, in between me (Reef Point/Thousand Trails) and Hope Island at
4:45 today, then back South to North
heading for Deception Pass (?) around
5:15
. I've been here for 14 years and never caught sight of an Orca before this! -Todd Cowles - photos by Todd Cowles -

15:30 -
Hello! Just wanted to report a sighting today. Around
3:30 PM local just
north of Rosario Beach on Whidbey Island. A pod heading south
along the shoreline of as best I could tell
maybe 6-8
. Two or three large adults and the rest were juveniles. Pictures are attached that I screenshot from a video. As far as I could tell they were paralleling the coast southbound towards Deception. They rounded the corner and went out of sight before I could tell if they stayed close to shore or went out to deeper water. They were coming in fairly close before a boat with people fishing turned on their motor to maneuver around. Prior to seeing the whales, we were watching seals and dolphins swim around the grass beds near shore as well as some dolphin further out in the channel. -Collin Bolton - photo by Collin Bolton -

Mon,

Entry 14:
South Whidbey -
09:30 &

12:15
- Good Afternoon, I live at
Possession Point
and saw 1 Grey Whale heading South at about
9:30AM and it was coming up for about 3 times, then coming up, flipping its tale out and then staying down for a while and then a little further South it would do the same thing. Not moving too fast, but not going super slow. Then again at about
12:15 the exact same thing. May have been the same whale but it would have had to have circled back to Mukilteo and started that journey South again so I'm thinking maybe it was a different one. -Christa Canell

Entry 15:
Northern Saratoga Passage -

09:45 -
Hi, I was so excited today. Out on my kayak around 945 I saw whales! I don't know much about them since this is probably only my 2nd or 3rd time seeing them ever. We just moved here last September. We are in Oak Harbor on City Beach (Windjammer Park). The whales we're about 100 feet off shore? So here's my video I took while staying at the shoreline. I would love to know what kind of whale it was if you know. Either way it was an incredible experience! -Kim Schaff - creenshot from video by Kim Schaff -

this afternoon: while on annual feeding pit aerial survey they observed
3 grays deep feeding in sand bar between south end of Hat and Snohomish Delta
. One looked like Patch [unconfirmed].
