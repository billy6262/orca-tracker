Orca Sightings for June 22, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
- Orca network received a call from Den McClure who saw
one orca
1 week to 10 days ago, in
Willapa Bay, WA
- in the lower bay near the entrance, eating seals.
*
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research encountered
J's K's and the L2's
off the west side of
San Juan Island
, in the early
evening
. The whales were spread out in groups traveling north.

I watched
J-Pod
off of
Land Bank
and Lime Kiln on the west side of San Juan Island from about

3:30-
4:30
in the afternoon. They headed north very close to shore, then turned and started coming back south before veering to the west to meet in the incoming
K-Pod
. It was definitely one of those special passbys where most of the pod was just off the kelp beds, and onlookers got nice looks at all the J-Pod family groups!
Monika Wieland, San Juan Island

OrcaSound hydrophone, 1830:
First we heard mewing, like in
K-pod
, and then we heard S-1's as in J-pod. The whales were spread out and their blows drifted north in the southerly, backlit by the ever-so-slow setting sun - they were headed slowly north.
Val Veirs, San Juan Island
*
All the people on land, on the westside of
San Juan Island
enjoyed seeing
Orcas
swimming north, near shore, with the flooding tide, from about

3:30 to at least 4pm
. The whales were spread out from
Lime Kiln Point
south about a mile. All the boats appeared to maintaining the 1/2 mile from shore, no boat zone.

Between

1:10 and
1:45
a loose group of
orcas
passed SJI between
False Bay and Eagle Point
, moving East while hunting, zigzagging very seriously. They came by in a group of four (male, females, juvenile) followed by a group of 7 or 8, including two males and a very young orca.
Mary WillAllen, naturalist, The Whale Museum

Cool
orcas
off
SJI
today most of the day. First,
J pod
went down island on the ebb, then up island on the flood to
Lime Kiln
, with most of the pod making close passes to shore with lots of surface active behavior. As J1 and J2, among others, went north, most of the pod seemed to stall out around Lime Kiln, still with lots of surface activity. At the same time there were reports that K pod had passed Discovery Island and other reports further north had J1 and J2 disappearing. Minutes after J1 and J2 "disappeared," the orcas at Lime Kiln started heading at a fast pace off shore and towards Discovery. Within minutes J pod, including J1 and J2, were together making great time and distance against a strong flood tide. Several juveniles breached nearly continuously, until J pod met up with K pod and perhaps more than a few L's about a mile off
Hannah Heights
at around
5 p.m
. There were whales all over, with much active socializing. There appeared to be at least three groups of ten or more whales in close proximity, rolling all over each other, with much switching of whales (at least sprouters) between the groups. About half of K pod headed in close to the shore at Hannah Heights within 10 minutes of meeting up. At Hannah there was a good chop going on. The K pod whales appeared to be surfing, foraging and playing at the same time. A young calf (K42?) tried to copy the older whales and dove aggressively into a large wave before getting bashed sideways by the pretty good sized wave. The calf kind of wriggled like a fish, righted himself and continued on unabashed after his older brethren. As the flood tide began carrying the main group of orcas up island, the K pod whales that had been close in to the beach headed out and joined up with the main group. I left them just after
6 pm
still heading up island as a group. On another good note I think I have seen more socializing already this year, than all of last year which seemed to be a continual quest for food.

In the
afternoon
as the whales went north past
Lime Kiln
I was able to get a picture of
Gaia L-78
and
Wave Walker L-88
. I don't know if other L Pod whales were present with
J Pod and K Pod
, but it was interesting to see these whales with Js and Ks. I would imagine that their mom, Grace L-2 was there, but I didn't get a picture of her. L-2, L-78 and L-88 were seen with J and K pods on Monday
June 22nd as they all came south down Haro Strait.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
*
I saw
2 gray whales
off
West Beach
a little before
noon
. Looked to be an adult and a young one - could it be that a mom has brought her baby to Whidbey? They were a couple of hundred yards off-shore, and appeared to be heading SSW.
Jill Hein, Coupeville I have seen a minke whale out by swirl island, entrance to aleck bay, south Lopez Island. It has been moving around near the feeding seabirds.

Carla Hedgepeth called Orca Network to report seeing
2 orcas
in
Winchester Bay OR
, off the Umpqua River near Coos Bay, at

11:30 am.
There was a male & one female or juvenile, they were heading south. Location was 43 40.76 124 334.33.

I have seen a
minke whale
out by swirl island, entrance to aleck bay, south
Lopez Island
.
Sheila Bishop
*
Js
spent the
afternoon
South of
Pt. Roberts
trying to decide whether or not to battle the flood tide and come down to the San Juans. Nope. They decided to ride the flood back to the Fraser, and hopefully come on down tomorrow. The last I heard they were 10 miles North of East Pt. still headed North at

6:30 PM
.
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island

There is a
minke
whale headed south off of the west side of SJI - north side of
Hannah Heights
- approx 100 yards off shore,

8:05 pm
.

Two
grays
Between

3:00 &
3:30 PM
off the
west side of Whidbey
just north of Ft. Nugent Rd. They were spouting & heading south but then appeared to turn around.
Shirley Taft, Oak Harbor

Just had a call (

11:40 am
) from a friend observing
two gray whales
feeding very close together in very shallow water between the East and West Twin Rivers west of
Port Angeles
. One has a very distinct white blotch on underside of tail fluke.
Margaret Owens, Forks, WA

June 23, 2009
I have seen a
minke
whale out by swirl island, entrance to aleck bay, south
Lopez Island
.
Sheila Bishop

Minke
traveling west to east just outside the kelp line, south end of
Lopez
between the Monument on Iceberg Point Preserve and Flint Beach,

1:30pm

We met up with the [
orcas
] crossing to San Juan Island. They had been traveling quite fast according to the other boats and they ended up splitting into 2 or more groups, with some whales moving towards the southern half of the island and others northbound up Haro Strait. The Orcas were quite spread out in all directions - apparently it was J pod and K pod. We had some wonderful views of 2 younger calves playing in the currents where the kelp was collecting, along with logs and other debris. One even draped a bit of kelp across its dorsal fin!! We moved north, from one group to another and left them off of
Kellet Bluff
, Henry Island as we looped around the north side of San Juan Island. Then the sunset tour.
J pod
had covered some ground and was up in the Canadian Gulf Islands. We were able to watch
J27 (Blackberry)
who at 18 is turning into quite the large male. Along with J27 was his sister J31 and a sprouter male who I believe was J34. We were able to also get great looks at
J26
, the other 18 year old male with his mom
J16
and younger sibling
J42
. Again very active tonight! Breach after breach, even by the little calf! The next family group included
J17, J28, and newborn J44?

Ken Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, relayed a report of
orcas
, possibly L pod, off Swiftsure, heading west at

7:30 am
.
*
Orcas
were heard off the
hydrophone
between

3:21pm to
3:40pm
PST. It sounded like around half a dozen as I heard 4-5 distinct calls.

Got to finally catch up with
J pod
off Lime Kiln on Monday
evening
. They started coming by around

17:15
or so. I believe we got to see them all. They were fairly vocal as they swam by, Bob Otis had his radio out there with the hydrophones so we could hear them calling. Was a very windy time out there and the only boats were a couple watches out of Canada. The boats were so far out there, as the pod was very spread out. Take care!
Vickie Doyle, Kent, WA

Steve Hetler called in a real-time report at

9:30Pm
, of at least
four orcas
moving east, upriver about a quarter mile from the jetty at the mouth of the
Siuslaw River in OR
. He said there are many seals in the river.
*
Center for Whale Research received a report from Soundwatch of 40 plus whales traveling south from East Point on Saturna Island, B.C. at
12:25 p.m. At

2:00 p.m.
Center staff Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah encountered
J's and K's
in mixed tight groups traveling at a fast pace southwest through Boundary Pass (48째 43.930 N; 123째 09.584 W). The whales continued to travel past Turn Point and spread out across Haro Strait (48째 36.568 N; 123째 14.784W). All members of J and K pod were confirmed present as well as the L2's and L87. The rest of L pod reportedly went west in the Strait of Juan de Fuca earlier that morning.
Center for Whale Research

We spotted some whales travelling along the shores of
Point Roberts
, as they occasionally do when in the area. Initially, just a few whales were seen, then offshore, we started to see more fins. The whales were spread out over an area that was several square miles. They were travelling alone, or in very small groups, slowly drifiting with the tide, with no obvious direction of travel, and often doing long dives. We were fortunate to observe
K26 (Lobo)
spending some quality time with younger brother
K42
, even doing some side-by-side foraging. Further out in the Strait, we encountered
J1 and J2
. At one point, J1 lunged, presumably after a fish, and following that, J2 (Granny) breached twice - one a forward arch, and then one standard up in the air breach. Our passengers were so impressed when they heard that she may be approaching 100 years of age and still had that kind of energy and flexibility. Surprisingly, vocals were very sparse, and with almost no boat traffic, we would have been able to hear them for miles.
Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch

Jeff Hogan reported
Js, Ks & some L's
(at least L2 & L87) off the west side of
San Juan Island
.
*
2 days in a row of
all three pods
of Southern Residents! At
1500
, we observed the whales making the turn around Turn Island, and they really started pouring on the speed as they headed down Haro Strait. First came members of J Pod. We observed J1 Ruffles, J2 Granny, J30 Riptide as they porpoised past the boat. Then came a mixture of J's & Ls. I heard that there were members of K Pod as well, but I didn't observe any from our location. As they are known to do, as the whales made their way south, they began to spread out in smaller matriline groups. At
1600
, the whales were approaching
Kellett Bluff
.
John Boyd (JB), Marine Naturalist, Western Prince, Friday Harbor

All of
J-Pod
with some
L's and K's
porpoising, power swimming, against the strong flood tide, from Saturna Island southwest across
Boundary Pass
toward Stuart Island, from

2:20pm to
3:25pm
. They were traveling quite fast, in tight knit family groups. As we watched the first group approach Turn Point and the tide rips, one whale spy hopped, then 2 in unison, then the breaches started. There were 4 to 5 orcas in each group, 8 groups total, in that time period, heading around the point into Haro Strait. In every group, whales spy hopped, breached, lunged, cartwheeled, back flipped, pectoral slapped, or tail lobbed as they closed in on Stuart Island! Words can't describe the fantastic, countless breaches, percussive and surface behaviors!! Even J-1 Ruffles joined the party and breached!

At

17:58
I can hear whales at
Orca Sound hydrophone
.
Celia Barroso

They're there again (orcas on
OrcaSound
) right now -

5:08pm
!
Ruby Keefe, Culver City, CA
*
Heard some GREAT orca calls on the
OrcaSound
hydrophones beginning at about

4:30 pm
, then at

5:43 pm
on the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone
, so they must have been heading south along the west side of San Juan Island.
Susan Berta, Orca Network, Whidbey Island

Hearing our friends at

12:17am
on the
orcasound
hydrophone!
Ruby Keefe, Culver City, CA

Sounds like party time for the 'Superpod boys and girls' right now at
12 .15am
on the
Orcasound hydrophones
.
Marie O'Shaughnessy, Victoria B.C.

The return from Northern waters started at

9:07 AM
off the
Tsawassen Coal Doc
k with some great breaching and ended at

10:24
with the last ones passing the Lighthouse Marine Park.
Peter Hamilton, LifeForce, Pt. Roberts

Orca Network received a call from Bonnie McKee reporting a pod of
orcas
in
Admiralty Inlet
, off
Bush Pt
. at

1:40 pm
. She had observed at least 2 females so far, they appeared to be heading north. We headed down to Bush Pt, arriving at

2:25 pm
- by then they had crossed the Inlet, & were swimming north against the tide. Looked like 6-7 total, but no ID's as they were on the other side; possible Transients?
Susan Berta & Howard Garrett, Orca Network, Whidbey Island

I'm hoping for some clarification on which whales I saw today from the beach at Libby Road around
9.45 am
. I did not have binoculars with me, but our walking group observed a couple of boats idling followed by spouts from
two whales
. I watched for an hour as we walked to Hastie, and these whales were making steady progress towards Anacortes. At times there only seemed to be one, and more than once I saw a dark shape and a 'fountain' like blow
Sandra Pollard, Freeland, Whidbey Island
This sounds like the 2 Grays that have been off NW Whidbey lately

June 21, 2009
Gayle Dinsmore called Orca Network to report
3 orcas
(1 male, 2 females) heading north
70 miles south of Monterey, CA
a few hundred yards offshore.
*
Saw two babies, one breaching, tail slapping, and lots of dorsal fins of that
J pod and part of L pod
just after
noon
, while two spyhopping directly in front of us standing at
lime kiln state park
as though to state we're back and notice you all standing by awaiting-thanks!
Brian, a hooked whale watcher
*
The rest of
L and K pods
arrived at
Active Pass
at

2:30 PM
still heading south to meet up with Js, L12s and the two Ks.
J pod
was up at the Fraser River and from

8:30 PM to
9:05
they slowly travelled by
Point Roberts
with some foraging. Once all the socializing declined all three pods were heading back North towards Point Roberts. From
8:58 to
9:20 some of the orcas were seen off Point Roberts.
Peter Hamilton, LifeForce, Pt. Roberts
*
The orcas were in or very close to
Mutiny Bay
, Whidbey Island at around
3pm
. I believe there were at least 7 or 8 of them. There was one "baby" that looked very new. A couple of them have some pretty distinctive notches in their dorsal fins so maybe that could help to identify them. I was comparing my pictures to the dorsal fins on Transient KWs of BC & SE Alaska and I think the one with the two notches in its fin might be
TO36C
.
Lindsey McCune
I had a look at Lindsey McCune's photos of the transients (off Whidbey Island) and she definitely had the
T36's
. Simon Pidcock, Ocean Ecoventures
Jared Towers of Canada's Cetacean Research Program, Pacific Biological Field Station has further ID's on the Transient orcas photographed off S. Whidbey Island
June 21st: The animals I can confirm are as follows.
T036, T036B, T036C, T099, and T099B. T099A
is likely there as well but can't confirm it at low resolution. Jared Towers, Cetacean Research Program, Pacific Biological Station

After watching several whales pass by the Center and receiving various reports of more whales up north, Ken Balcomb, Howard Garrett, Erin Heydenreich, Emma Foster and Basil Von Ah of the Center for Whale Research, departed onboard both Orca and Starlet. At approximately

4:10 p.m.
both vessels encountered
J, K, and L pods
travelling in tight groups up Boundary Pass (48째 44.495 N; 123째 07.195 W) . It appears that
all members of the three pods were present, totaling 86 whales
. The encounter ended at

6:30 p.m
. The whales were traveling tight in two groups and continued north up Boundary Pass (48째 44.877 N; 123째 05.293 W).
Center for Whale Research
*
We saw an incredible display by
J Pod
at

1:45 to
2:15pm
. We first spotted the dorsals just North of
American Camp
on the West side of San Juan. The pod was moving north, in small group of 3 or 4 spread out along maybe a 1/4 quarter mile. Whales were close to shore, sometime within 10 feet just south of False Bay. The males and some younger whales really put on the show with dual spy hops, cartwheels, full breaches by the younger whales and lots of tail slapping. Mike, Alki and Blackberry were identified by the naturalist on aboard. Very interesting was the identification of a male, Mega, from L Pod and the naturalist thought there may have been some mating outside of False Bay. First hand viewing seemed to confirm this may have been the case. J Pod continued North toward Lime Kiln when we left and turned South.
Jennifer Parker, Seattle
*
We spent our afternoon on the northwest corner of San Juan Island in Speiden Channel with Southern Resident Orcas from
J & L pods
! J pod was just passing
Henry Island
and playing in a rip or current where presumbably they were fishing. They were very active - changing direction, tail slapping, and even some logging at the surface by 1 or 2 whales. They continued north forming tight groups and picked up speed with a few Orcas porpoising out of the water with force. Then slowing again - more activity - even a few breaches! The
L12
subgroup was not far behind also traveling north.
Jaclyn, naturalist, Crew At San Juan Safaris Whale Watch Wildlife Tours
*
At least 5, as many as 8 or 10
orcas
were observed off of Pipers Lagoon Park in
Nanaimo
. (124 56 42 W, 49 13 40 N). One very large whale (~4 to 5 ft. dorsal fin), 2 small babies, 2 or more juveniles, traveling northwest,
2 pm
.
Adam Compton
*
There were at least
20 Orca Whales
spotted on the west side of
Lopez Island
between

11:00 to
1:00
.
Theresa Borrodell
*
Three
minke
whales viewed in very close proximity feeding in
Salmon Bank
around
3pm
. All whales seen no further than 200 feet from the boat. Whales viewed for 5 minutes before heading to Anacortes.
Jennifer Parker, Seattle
*
Howard Garrett, calling from the Center for Whale Research on west San Juan Island reported the
L12s
heading north off Eagle Pt. and
J pod
off Iceberg Pt. heading south at

10:30 am
. Orcas also reported off Salmon Bank at
10:55. At
1:10 pm, J pod & the L12s were passing the Center heading north. At
2:30 pm the Center received reports that the orcas up north were now in Active Pass, heading south, so it looks like a Superpod is in the making! Update: Howard joined Ken Balcomb and the Center for Whale Research staff in heading up to see the superpod - they encountered them at approx.

4:10 pm
off the NW tip of
Stuart Island
, and left them at about

6:25 pm
south of Saturna Island, as all three pods headed north toward Boundary Pass. Ken Balcomb reported that they had looked through all their photos & film from the superpod encounter, and
all known whales in the Southern Resident Orca community were present and accounted for
- great news for Orca Month!!
*
We heard
J-Pod
was slowly working their way north near
Kellett Bluff
. Soon (
1330
) we were watching J-Pod actively working the tide rips in search of salmon near Kellett Bluff. Lots of direction changes as the whales did their thing, sometimes maintaining their position by swimming into the current. We saw several spyhops, tail slaps, and I was especially excited to see my "buddy" J1 Ruffles. We also saw
J30
Riptide, and one of the new moms (her saddle was hidden by the waves in the riptide). But the day suddenly got even better. We had heard reports of a group of unidentified whales passing Campbell River last night around 1800. We got a report from a friend that a large group of "maybe Transients" had just made it through Active Pass. Soon (
1430
) we were off of Prevost Island and saw fins. LOTS OF FINS. Before we knew it, whales started breaching everywhere! Not acting like Transients, we soon thought--Residents?? And that's when we began to make some IDs,
L78
(Gaia),
L72
(Racer),
L7
(Canuck),
K26
(Lobo), K16 (Opus),
K21
(Cappucino), and
K40
(Raggedy). We left the whales heading South in
Swanson Channel
near Thieves Bay at 1500.

Very loud calls on Orca Sound hydrophones. Sounds like
Jpod
. There are clicks also. Time is
1326
.
Cathy Bacon, Texas
*
1430: J pod
widely spread out and moving north. Nice vocals (calls and clicks) on the
OrcaSound
hydrophone.
Val Veirs, San Juan Island
*
Well over a dozen
orcas
headed west from
Aleck Bay
toward Iceberg Point at about

10:30
this morning. Their travel pace was pretty relaxed but they made sure to give a show on the way: a couple nice breaches, some tail slaps and several spy hops.
Tom Reeve, Lopez Island
*
Just reporting a sighting of a pod of
Orcas
right off
Mutiny Bay
on
Whidbey Island
. It was about
3pm
. They were heading towards Seattle initially but then turned around and appeared to be circling in the shipping channel. We aren't familiar with the various pods but this one seemed to include at least
7 whales
, including one baby and another younger (1 year old?) one. They were traveling then would stop, play and go in various directions. They seemed to be feeding on something-we saw lots of fish on our fish finder and some [porpoise] in the distance but couldn't really see what they were eating.
Caron McCune
*
Jeff Dodd of Langley called this afternoon to report a sighting of
4 orcas
from the
Port Townsend/Keystone ferry
at
1 pm
. It appeared to be 4 females, milling off Pt. Hudson, between Pt Hudson & Pt. Wilson. They were about 1/4 mile from a large bait ball and some seals - not sure, but a guess would be these are Transients, likely the group reported last night off west Whidbey.
*
Got a chance to take my little girl out to see the
gray whales
for the first time in her life. They are still around the northern section of West Beach RD heading south. I realize you already received a great picture from a spotter but I was able to catch both the bigger whale and the calf coming up to spout in unison. Unfortunately I was on the shore and they were 100 yards or so out.
William Ingram
*
We watched
2 gray whales
for half an hour around

3:30 pm
at the pull-out south of Swan lake on
West beach road on Whidbey Island
. They were swimming side by side, hanging out in the same area close to shore and then slowly moved South and away from shore some more. We never saw their flukes.
Liz Brown

June 20, 2009
Off
Carmanah Pt.
(west coast of Vancouver Island) About 6-8 [orcas] (some juvenile) travelling east.
Stan Shepherd
*
The day started off with a sighting of a
Gray whale
off
Point Roberts
Marina at
7 AM
. At

4:55 PM
the
orcas
were off
Point Roberts
heading north to their historic fishing grounds off the arms of the Fraser River.
Peter Hamilton, LifeForce, Pt. Roberts
*
At
Turn Point
the Prince of Whales zodiac met up with members of
J Pod
around
1pm
. The whales were so active with numerous breaches etc. They were slowly heading toward the Strait of Georgia. Several family groups were swimming together, however I never saw the tiny ones, J44 and J45. They must have been tucked in tight close to mom. I had never seen Ruffles, J1 breach before. His huge pectoral fins were impressive.
Marie, Orca-Magic, Prince of Whales
*
We received another report, from Fran Mandich of
Bush Pt
- they saw an active pod of
4 or 5 orcas
off Bush Pt. heading south quickly at

8:20 pm
.
*
T49A, T49A1 and T49A2
were skulking around between
Race Rocks
and Pedder Bay for most of the day.
Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales, Victoria BC
*
We had
T2's, T14 and T20 and 21
pass by
Campbell River BC
this morning, last seen south bound at Bates Beach, Comox.
Matthew Ellis, Eagle Eye Adventures, Campbell River
*
Js and K20/38
, going N at
Coal Docks
,

6:30 PM
.
Capt. Jim Maya, Maya's Westside Charters, San Juan Island
*
J Pod
traveled north up
San Juan Island
, past Turn Pt. continuing to head north.
Ruffles J-1 and Granny J-2
were in the lead and they had company -
Spock K-20 and Comet K-38
! We saw LOTS of
orca
. These were all in the vicinity of
Stuart Island
, between

1:45 and
2:15 pm
. Photos submitted included shots of the
J14s
&
J16s
, confirmed by Dave Ellifrit of the Ctr. for Whale Research.
Jeanne Hyde, San Juan Island
*
On the afternoon trip again,
J Pod plus K20 & K38
were observed crossing the
Strait of Georgia
from the East Point of Saturna Island to the Point Roberts/Tsawwassen area. It was one breach after another as the whales made the crossing, with some individuals repeating the behaviour up to 5 times in a row. One whale managed to get his entire body clear of the water by flicking his tail flukes to the side at the height of his breach!
Joan Lopez, Naturalist, Vancouver Whale Watch
*
On the
1630
Keystone to
Port Townsend
ferry, a
minke
whale was observed by myself and the ferry captain around
1645
. The whale was approximately 100 yards off the bow of the ferry. It was alone, heading west just north of Port Townsend Bay. I saw it surface three times.
Scott Hagerty, Port Townsend, WA
*
Had some of your
Southern Resident
friends come through Discovery Passage headed home! They might be a little skinnier as they had to run the Discovery treadmill, bucking a 7 knot ebb tide and moving through the water at bursts of 14-15 knots! We left them still travelling at
2030
hours in 3 distinct groups. We are guestamating 24-26 animals total.
Nick Templeman, Discovery Marine Safaris,
Campbell River
*
15+
Orcas
just reported (

8:45 pm
) heading south past
Campbell River BC
, stay tuned for id's. (
maybe L's and K's?
)
Matthew Ellis, Eagle Eye Adventures, Campbell River
*
Orcas
sighted off Whiskey Point,
Quadra Island BC
. between

20:10 and
20:40
(approximately: N 50 02' 10.4" / W 125 12' 55.3"). We believe 6 in one group and 9 in the second group, traveling south - toward Cape Mudge and the Strait of Georgia. They were simply swimming against the out tide. First group was reasonably close together. Second group would have been spread out almost in a line of about 200 meters. One very large male for sure in the second group.
Ken Robertson

We have a small [
orca

On our afternoon trip,
J Pod
was spread out along Sturgeon Back, Strait of Georgia, from the South Arm to the North Arm of the
Fraser River
. There was obviously alot of foraging going on, but also a fair amount of socializing. We were priviliged to observe
J27
(Blackberry) and little brother
J39
(Mako) engaged in some playful behaviour. Photo of J39 doing a teasing spyhop. On the other boat, Sue (the Naturalist) reported
J42
(Echo) and little
J45
performing alternating spyhops, while the remainder of their matrilines milled nearby. It's fantastic to have J Pod back, foraging and socializing once again.

We saw our first
Orcas
of the year today off
Point Roberts
between

8:30 and
9:00 pm
. We were watching from the beach and spotted five whales with at least one large male in the group. They were moving quickly in the choppy seas with some breaching, tail slapping, and charging. As they passed the Point they headed South.

What with the wind, the waves, the flood tide and meeting up with the
L12's
once again. We saw a total of 8 whales on my first Zodiac trip at noon. Initially we found five off by themselves including three big boys and two females at
Constance Bank
, then later encountered Mega L41, and his sisters L77 and L94, closer to shore. The
3.30pm
Ocean Magic encountered Mega, L41 and Alexis L12, heading out west, past Metchosin, Vancouver Island between
4-5pm
. Other whales were seen in the distance but too far to ID.

Once at the
naval air station
, Whidbey Island we watched two
Gray Whales
feeding in 20'-40' of water. One was definitely a larger adult with the second one most likely being a juvenile. They would take several breaths and then dive for 2-3 minutes. They were moving in generally a southward direction. As we were leaving for our sunset trip we came upon a
Minke Whale
in the mouth of Friday Harbor. It slowly circled the boat in a feeding pattern. It was taking single breaths and then diving for approximately 2 minutes.

I am writing to report that we saw
3 Orca's
while running back from Heceta Banks towards
Newport, OR
at approximately
11 am
. I did not record the lat and lon, but we were approximately 2 miles S x SW of the southern tip of Stonewall Banks. The Orca's were travelling nearly due South in tight formation with what appeared to be 2 adults and 1 juvenile or calf. I am not positive if there was a male as the fins on the adults appeared to be close to the same length. The water at that point was about 58 degree's and smooth.

I spotted a
Minke
whale off the bow of our whale watching boat coming out of

A group of 5 of the
L-12, L-22's
in a fairly close formation, slowly swimming from the
Salmon Bank
buoy northwest toward San Juan Island, from

12:55pm to
1:50pm
. At first they seemed to be traveling in 2 groups, then all 5 came together, and appeared to be resting in the slack flood tide with little tidal exchange. I could ID L-12, L-89 (Solstice near the Solstice!), and not sure, but think the other male was L-85, along with 2 other females. The sun glinting off their backs and through the spray of their exhalations, the 2 males shoulder to shoulder coming up together, was beautiful, but made it difficult to ID.

Ken Balcomb encountered the
L12's
spread out a few miles off
False Bay

we observed just off of the north end of
West Beach Road
(a mile south of the Navy Base) -
2 PM
. The south end of Lopez Island is way off in the background. This one just about came under our boat, while we were drifting with the engine off! This whale is one of two now moving south, parallel to West Beach Road, just about where it intersects with Ft Nugent Road about

2:30 PM.
Maybe the patches will help ID.
Rudy and Barbara Deck, Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island
Thanks to Rudy and Barbara's great photos, Cascadia Research was already able to ID the whale pictured above: Amber Klimek, our primary gray whale matcher, took a look at the whale in the photos Barbara Deck took on the 16th and found it in our catalogs this afternoon. It is CRC-396, first seen in 1999 in Disco Bay, Northern Puget Sound, and last seen in 2006 off British Columbia. In the years between, it's been spotted in the summer months hanging out near southwest Vancouver Island, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and off the Northern Washington Coast. Thanks for the great photos!

In the
morning
Five Star Whale Watching's vessel Fastcat, discovered two large
Humpback
Whales near the Victoria Golf Buoy heading East. The two Humpbacks were being very lathargic when first sighted, doing 5-6 minute dives. However, as we continued to observe the two Humpback Whales they did begin to become more active and later in the morning a double breach was seen. The last reports of the Humpback Whales were that they were near
Port Angeles
.

We were on our way to the Victoria area this afternoon to watch the 3
Transients
that had shown up there, when something in the water caught the eye of Captain John. We were just south of Beaver Point on
Saltspring Island
when
T20 and T21
surfaced. They were doing very long dives, 7-8 minutes at a time, and were likely resting. They still followed a zig-zagging pattern though, making it very difficult to predict where they would surface again. Given the long dives, it was pure chance that these whales were spotted at all. We left T20 and T21 after
4 PM
, travelling in a mostly northerly direction towards Navy Channel.

We had a report of
Transients
at Constance Bank. Before long (about

Our evening tour spent time with a
Humpback Whale
. We think that it was the same animal from the day before, but this time it was in
Griffin Bay
at about

6:00 PM

from about

1:10pm to 2pm
during slack ebb tide. We watched the whale surfacing, taking 4 to 5 breaths, then diving from 4-6 minutes. The juvenile, about 40'? in length, seemed to be zig zagging as it was slowly working it's way west-northwest, as it would surface offshore, then the next surfacing would be inshore, repeating this transecting pattern. Only saw the flukes once, it showed the arching of it's body- the humped back- on every last surfacing before it dove! On our way out in the Strait we saw 2 groups of 3 Dall's Porpoise.

We caught up with the
L12 sub-group
off of the
south end of San Juan Island
today. They were traveling mainly along the coastline, but at South Beach they took a right turn and moved offshore. L41 "Mega" was seen as well as L12 "Alexis" who was photographed by one of our guests. The group as a whole was very active with lots of seemingly playful behavior occuring, like multiple spyhops by one animal, repetitive tail lobbing by a juvenile and an adult that rolled over behind our boat and proceeded to beat the water with a pectoral flipper. The animals would bunch-up and then separate and were continuing to move further offshore when we departed the scene at

2:45 PM

The
3.30pm
Ocean Magic encountered some of
L pod orca
this afternoon off
San Juan Island
. We found 'Mega', L 41 and 'Alexis, L 12, foraging 1-2 miles offshore from other members of this family group. We watched for a while and then moved closer to shore where we watched L 77 'Matia' and two others that I weren't able to identify, as they were far off. They were all heading North. I did hear that K 20 and K38 had joined this group so perhaps those two seen very close to shore were the K's.
As if that wasn't magic enough (see above report), on the way back we sighted two more
Orca
off Seabird Lighthouse, Discovery Island, and they turned out to be
T20 and T21
. We only saw them once and then they disappeared.

I was forwarded an e-mail and photos from Julia regarding a group of killer whales. She got some pretty good photos so hopefully someone can identify who this group of (transient?) killer whales is. Dawn Noren, NOAA Fisheries
Forwarded report: My name is Julia and I am working with pinnipeds at the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR. On Tuesday I saw a group of at least
8 orcas
off the
central Oregon coast
traveling southwards, between

5:40 pm
and around

9:00 pm
. The group consisted of two big males (one of them has a very remarkable dorsal fin - looks like cut at the tip), several adult females and probably one calf. The first sighting was at
5:41 pm pretty close to the shore in Depoe Bay. They spent about 20 minutes in the bay before slowly traveling south. A sea lion was present but the orcas seemed not to be interested at all. I followed them and saw them again off Rocky Creek State Park, Otter Crest and Cape Foulweather. Off Rocky Creek they were playing (or hunting?) and breaching. One of the big males separated from the group (maybe with one or more group members) and continued traveling south. From time to time they swam farther off shore and were hard to see. I ended up watching at Moolack Beach where the they were pretty close to the beach again. They showed almost the same behavior as off Rocky Creek for at least an hour. Around sunset they swam farther off shore again and I lost sight.

We forwarded these photos to orca researchers and received the following replies:
"I can ID
T125 and T127
from the attached photos. It would be likely that both T125A and T128 would be present as well. These animals are usually seen near Langara Island so it's nice to have an encounter of them so far to the south. Jared Towers, Canada's DFO Pacific Biological Field Station, B.C. And from Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "Looks like
T125 and T127 plus others
."

K20 and K38
were spotted off the west side of
San Juan Island
around

10:30 a.m.
Center staff Erin Heydenreich and Emma Foster responded to the sighting and encountered the duo off Battleship Rock (48째 36.980N; 123째 12.211W) at noon. The mother calf pair were traveling slow and tight heading north. The encounter ended at
12:48 pm at
Turn Point
with the whales continuing north toward Boundary Pass (48째 41.261 N; 123째 14.720 W).

By the time Linda got out to see them they had headed west, out to sea.

Jeff Hogan called to relay reports of
orcas
off west San Juan Island at
10 am

Orca Network received a call from
Pt. Arena, CA
Lighthouse docent Brian Riehl (also a Pt. Arena city councilman), with a report of a pod of
at least 5 orcas
(he saw 4 or 5 surface at once for sure), including a small calf but no adult males present, about 1.5 - 2 miles off the Pt. Arena Lighthouse. He first saw a breach at
1 pm
, then only a spout & nothing more. Then at ~
1:45 pm he saw the group of 5, watched them milling & possibly feeding for about 10 minutes, then they just seemed to disappear, so he couldn't tell which direction they came from or left toward. He said they have had a sea lion colony there for the past week - in an area where they hadn't had sea lions for years, & this morning there were 2 dead sea lions on the beach, but they didn't have bites or teeth rake marks on them.

Orcas
off the
central oregon coast
- around

7:30 p.m
. my boyfriend and I were sitting in our hot tub over looking
Otter Rock
watching
a grey whale
and some sea lions close to the beach when further off shore, just west of Bird Rock we spotted fins and ran to get the binoculars. I was certain they were Orcas because the fins were just too large to be porpoises. We figured we would watch them as they continued to travel north and that would be it -- but the excitement was just beginning. Three adults and one baby Orca came right into shore so we jumped out of the hot tub and drove down the street to the point over looking Devils punchbowl to get a closer look. They were so close we did not need our binoculars. They were breaching over and over again! We were the only people out there on the head land to see this until we phoned one neighbor, then the word got out and within 10 minutes half the neighborhood showed up! A group of three sea lions began swimming south from the marine gardens and were headed straight toward the Orcas! When the sea lions discovered the trouble they were in all three jumped out the water and dove toward the rocks. We couldn't figure out if all this breaching, rolling and tail slapping was some kind of ritual, play, mating or feeding?? Still unsure if they had a sea lion under water that they were feeding on or if the sea lions got away? The pod finally said goodbye and continued on their journey North about

8:30 p.m.

Early in the day we had reports of
K20 & K38
inbound. We saw the whales several miles east of
Dungeness
at
1330
. The mother/calf pair were moving at a fairly good clip, with K38 sometimes ahead of mom, sometimes behind. Both appeared to be in good health and moving well. While we have seen matrilines sometimes "do their own thing", this is the first time I've seen a mother/calf separate from the other 4 members of her matriline (especially this pair). We last saw Spock & Comet heading
east
at
1420
.

K-20 and K-38
off of
Ediz Hook
from about

2:15 to
2:30pm
. They were traveling
southeast
with the flooding tide at a fair pace. In my 12 years of observing the SRKW community, I have not seen just 2 whales without the rest of their family, pod, or other community members reportedly in the general area!?

pst. Pod of
4 orca
. One large dorsal, 3 smaller. Viewed from Devils Punchbowl State Park,
Otter Rock, OR.
10 miles north of Newport, OR. Full breaches, tail slapping, for about 30 minutes. Moved north towards Cape Foulweather and Depoe Bay. Probably feeding on Otter Rock resident harbor seals. Very few gray calves have been spotted yet. The grays usually begin to be abundant around June/July close to the Otter Rock shoreline. We usually see one or two lone transients here. Having this pod display, and so close to shore, is a rare treat.

We were fishing out of Neah Bay, first sighting was
Humpbacks
11 miles out near J bouy. This is the east end of Swiftsure bank, there were 4 together and we saw them in a feeding pattern for many hours. One very large one did a full straight up breach and rose to about the rear hump, maybe 75 yards from us - very impressive! We thought that sharing the water with the humpbacks had made for an epic day and on our return about two miles west of Tatoosh Island
a pod of orcas
came in sight! Very actively feeding while we paralled them for a good period and made note the largest male had a dorsal that was turned over in a very tight curl at the top (right to left curled). I guess there were six or seven in the group with one small one probably half the size of the rest.

Joe Alicea of Oak Harbor called to report a
Gray whale
off Joseph Whidbey State Park at

Two members of
K pod
were encountered off
East Point
(Saturna Island), between
2-2.30pm

You probably have gotten this by now, but six (likely Ks)
Orcas
were reprorted at the
County Park
yesterday morning about

9:00 AM
. By the time we got on scene,
10:15, there were two. K
20 and a calf, probably K38
. They headed N toward Turn Pt. then up Boundry toward the Coal Docks. I last saw them at

3:30
. The other four were never seen, as far as I know. In all my 20 yrs. watching Killer Whales, I've never seen just two SRKW's on their own for such a long time. Several years ago, I saw J1 nip at a female, and for the next few days she and her small line, three offspring as I remember, wandered the Islands by themselves for a week or so. Very interesting.

Saw what appeared to be the
Grey whale(s)
again off the Nor'Wester building and the west runway (
NAS Whidbey
, NW Whidbey Isl). Appeared to be about 150ish yards out and seemed to be staying in one place, coming closer to land then moving back out to the sound. Looked like two of them spouting for about a min. then they would dive for about 10 mins. Watched them for about 45 mins around
1630
. Saw the same two boats as Chuck Niedzialkowski saw on
June 4th and they were indeed close to the whales but had motors off. Perhaps the whales were swimming to them?

We were thrilled to see a
pod of orcas
as we approached the
Strait of Juan de Fuca
at
1441
. We observed them for about an hour from a distance of 1/4 mile or so. Pictures are attached (see above). We were at 48째 03.3' and 124째 54.0' (west of Lake Ozette, ). It is estimated that there were 8 orcas, 3 of them adult males, traveling SE. There may well have been more than 8. As we sail to the Queen Charlotte Islands, along the west coast of Vancouver Island, and in September, back home to Oregon, we will send our observations of Orcas and other cetaceans.
Fraser Pierson & Jeff Hubbell, SV Storm Petrel
My best guess for the last photo (shown here) is L41 with L77. It would make the best sense since we had them on
June 2nd headed that way.

I was rowing around the south end of Rat Island (near Indian Island across from
Port Townsend
) about 100 yards past the turn inside the green buoy. At very low tide I know it's about 20 or 30 feet deep there since I can sometimes see the eel grass. Anyway my right blade hit something and immediately thereafter a
Gray whale
blew briefly right under my port rigger - and then dived, brushing the bottom of my boat with its back or tail. I'm pretty sure the whale was as surprised as I was. Did the whale see me? I think not. After our encounter this morning the whale took off toward the Navy dock, and then circled back to swim parallel to my path and blew a couple of more times. It never did breach and I never really saw its body but I would guess it was at least 25 feet long and made quite a wake just below the surface as it swam away from me.

Grey whales
off the Nor'Wester building (
NAS Whidbbey
) again today. About 150 Yds off the shore. At least one good size Grey Whale that was actually rotating sideways such that we thought we were seeing an Orca fin at first! The Grey seems to be happily feeding.

Spotted pod of
orcas
swimming along the shore of South Thormanby Island, in the evening between

7:30pm -
8:30pm
. There were
6 orcas
in the pod swimming right along the rocks and cliffsand 1 lone orca swimming approx 100meters off shore. They were travelling W along the shore heading towards
Halfmoon Bay (BC
Sunshine Coast - Lat: 49.28'00.21 N, Long:123.57'48.73W). They were hunting and feeding on seals. Saw at least 2 seals get munched. The lone orca swimming off shore. had the largest dorsal fin, likely a male.

The MV Sea Lion headed out to

Minke Whale
feeding there. Two other whale watch boats were in the area and they both had Minkes with them as well, for a total of
three
. We arrived at approximately

2:00 PM
and stayed for a little more than half an hour. We saw the whale surface 10 or 12 times coming rostrum first out of the water. We could even discern the rostral grooves and got good looks at the pointed snout.

at
Yaquina Head

7am

We received the below ID's for these Transient orcas reported off Yaquinna Head, Newport OR on

We conducted one of our monthly outer coast surveys from
Westport, WA
. It was incredibly calm, both in terms of weather and whales. We saw
two gray whales
,
two humpbacks
, small numbers of
Dall's and harbor porpoise
, and one northern fur seal all day. One interesting note was a gray whale that we found in the midst of a high density of crab pots. We were worried when we saw the whale swimming right into a set of buoys at the surface, but then it did it again, and again - at one point the whale actually took a set of buoys down with it when it dove, only to release them 10 seconds later. We were preparing ourselves for an entanglement, but apparently it was well aware of what it was doing, rubbing itself along the lines.

I believe today along with
T-14
in the
Campbell River
area. Left on our tour at
1515
from C.R. with reports of orcas off of Fransisco Point, south end of Quadra Island. Went around and found
5
animals in post feeding activity. The young one was breaching alot, and amazing vocalization for about 40 minutes. Afterwards we headed to the mouth of Bute Inlet and found a black bear foraging along the shoreline. We found another black bear on Sonora Island on the way home, and some info on the way turned into finding "Pender" T-14 Southbound @ Cape Mudge (see photo above). A beautiful trip and happy guests with a 4hr safari turning into 6hrs!

One
gray whale
in
Boundary Bay
today. It was actively foraging the entire time we were there - about 45 minutes. When we began to leave, very slowly making our way out of the area, the whale suddenly appeared alongside the boat, and then one more time before turning back to its foraging area. On
May 27, there were 5 grays in the bay - at least 3 of which had been there since mid-April. I think this whale is our final visitor for the season.

Gray whale
today at

2:20 pm
near
Whidbey Island Naval Base
. These whales have a streamlined body with a narrow, tapered head. Gray whales are always great to watch, we observed the whale foraging. We even saw the whales fluke. Gray whales are bottom sediment feeders. The whale exhibited the predictable breathing pattern. Gray whales are a mysticete or baleen whale and have two blow holes. Sometimes you can see a heart or v-shaped spray.

What a magnificent start to Orca Month with over
20 Transient Orcas
in the
Strait of Juan De Fuca
! During our afternoon tour we were incredibly fortunate to not only observe two Harbor Seal kills by the Transient Orcas but
a greeting ceremony
as two different groups met north of
Port Angeles
. We observed one dramatic kill in particular as a young Orca porpoised directly towards a harbor Seal and then exploded onto the poor unsuspecting Seal! Later as the two groups met we saw a number of tailslaps, Spyhops, pectoral waves and breaches, it was breathtaking to watch.
Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching

The call came -
3 miles N of Dungeness Spit
, which is near
Sequim
. One of the other captains announced that there was a seal to the port side of his boat. No sooner said, three female
orcas
headed toward the poor seal at top speed, porpoising through the water with blazing speed. The captain said he just saw the seal turn its head toward the onrushing Orcas about a second before he was gone. This all happened so quickly that I missed most of it with my camera but not the eyes. We left about

4:00 PM
and shortly after that the last boat on scene departed and the Ts were not to be found again yesterday evening.
