Orca Sightings for March 31, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
08:45 (approx.)
- Hi!
J pod (J27) went northbound through Active Pass this morning.
They continued north in the Strait of Georgia. -Rachelle Hayden

Entry 2:
Puget Sound (T65As & T137s)
. Hours had passed since Howie had eyes on the orcas in Admiralty so I thought I'd take a peek from Richmond Beach, while on a grocery run, to see if the pod headed south and if could get any IDs. About
13:45 I pulled over side of the road above
Kayu Kayu Ac park
and few minutes later spotted a
female/calf pair heading southbound
on the east side of the channel just off the park. A male, further east in the channel, was trailing by several minutes. At the time it appeared to me it was T65A2 (which I could later confirm from video). He was lazily making his way south on his own. A 2nd larger male was more mid channel. Before leaving the area, I could confirm at least 6 orcas, including at least 2 males. In addition, but couldn't confirm at the time, I was thinking I saw at least a few others, mix of females/juvies more mid channel.
*
Late afternoon while down south, I decided to try and find the whales again in the event they continued south, as well. I did find them in
Central Puget Sound
at first grouped, but the males were weaving in and out of the core group alone or together, and for short time one male and juvie were traveling together. I couldn't confirm all IDs on sight, but looking over my video later (and few crappy images) could see some of the T65As and T137s at least. I cannot confirm all individuals present due to distance, but numbers and make up fits probability it was
T65As and T137s
. I left the whales continuing south somewhere around
Des Moines/Point Robinson area just after
19:00
. (The next day
April 1st the T65As (minus T65A5) and T137s were confirmed traveling together in Puget Sound so is likely same configuration I saw on 31st - alb). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 3:
Admiralty Inlet to Central Puget Sound -

13:00 - A pair of orcas were about half a mile north of Edmonds near the mainland side
at 1 pm. Medium sized. Maybe juveniles. They seemed to have stuck around for a while in the vicinity of an area here where I've seen greys and a humpback feeding in the past. Basically, straight out into the sound on a line with SR 527, about 400-800 yards off shore. -Vern Francissen

10:20 -
I last saw whales about
10:20 heading east, midchannel. I'm assuming they're Ts, from the low number (about 6) and the way they milled around under a bird ball for maybe 10 min. I saw one adult male. [from
south of Bush Point, Whidbey Island
]. South of the buoy, eastbound.

10:02 - [orca] Got Em!

Camille called back: Orcas milling, about 100 yards off shore or closer in. They are now heading south 6 total (at least one male), hard to tell..., not all up at once, approx.
4-6 moving faster
