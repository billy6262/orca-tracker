Entry 4:

On
March 24 at

5:40pm
saw a spout and a whale breech in
Elliott Bay
between the Edge Water Hotel and Victoria Clipper slip). I believe it was only one whale and it went north along the shoreline of Myrtle Edwards Park. The whale seemed to turn back south and follow the shoreline back toward the city. Never in my 11 years living in Belltown have I ever seen a whale - I was flipping out! It was amazing! --Yes, it was a large whale. --By breach I mean the whale broke the surface - I saw it break the surface maybe 10-12 times as I followed. --I didn't notice a dorsal fin. -Liz Chase Abbott
