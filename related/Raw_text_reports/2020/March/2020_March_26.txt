11:13 - killer whales in Hood Canal
. We just spotted
5 Bigg's "Transient" orcas just north of Foulweather Bluff
. We were motoring on our s/v Polaris when we saw that distinctive dorsal fin pop up. Put the boat into neutral immediately, but they swam right in front of us, not more than 20 feet off our bow. It happened today around
11:13 am. They were
traveling W-NW toward Oak Bay
. We are so blessed! Will send pictures and video in hopes that you can identify the pod. Thanks! -Tamara Miller
