Hi there!! 436PM time stamp on video [seen here]. We're on the
ferry from Southworth to Fauntleroy and they announced Orcas
! [Susan confirmed that orcas traveled on the west side of Blake Island.] -Susan Larsen

Hi. I just spotted
3-4 orcas traveling north on west side of Vashon
. Just south of Southworth ferry. I'm on NW part of Vashon. -Teresa L. Nauta Tippett

14:00 - Small pod of orcas NB in Colvos Passage
, approx. 1 mile south of Southworth Ferry, close to Vashon side. -Tim Ferris

13:50 - Vashon side, now at Fern Cove, northbound.

13:35 - [orca] I see them heading north in Colvos Passage
, mid channel or more towards the Vashon side. They are about half a mile South of Fern Cove. -Roxane Jackson Johnson

14:00 - [orca] From just north of Point Richmond
At 2pm they were approaching Point Richmond and I had eyes on them, but a few of those sailboats made close passes and I haven't seen them since. I almost wonder if they turned back up north. Still waiting...I had been observing them [from just north of Point Richmond] with my binoculars fighting the current near Sanford Point, and at the time they appeared to be heading diagonally, straight (slowly) towards me & I was SO EXCITED!!! Right after these close passes from the sailboats I lost sight of them, presumed they must have turned back north and never regained sight, but still fun to see them briefly. -Anika Blake

13:35 - Pod of ~ 5-6 orcas - Bigg's Transient orcas - T46s - Colvos Passage -
(including 2 bulls) moved over now more mid channel at south end of
Lisabuela Park, Vashon
. They are either fighting current or a bit asleep. Have slowed way down, while continuing steady southbound in choppy seas. Boys look like could be T46s (confirmed later as T46s from my video). Biting wind; bundle up and keep 6 feet from your neighbors.

13:14 - Pod is grouped heading southbound across from Lisabuela, Vashon
, south of Al's, Olalla, now. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

headed south towards Point Richmond and Dalco. What an awesome curved big dorsal fin on the big one!!! -Brendan Phillips
*

13:05 - Southbound.
I am at
Wilson Creek/Driftwood Cove
, and they definitely went south of my view about an hour ago. They weren't moving very fast. I have been watching off and on and have not seen them heading north but I may have missed them if they turned around.

12:04 - Orcas heading south Colvos Passage
!! Towards the Kitsap side of the Passage, Driftwood Cove. At least one bull (Maybe 2 bulls?) and 2 or 3 others, smaller. -Roxane Jackson Johnson

. -Kersti Elisabeth Muul

10:30 - [orca]
(from neighbor on
South Beach, Bainbridge
) Big male and some smaller ones. Maybe 5. Hard to know when they don't all surface at once! They were surfacing in front of our house but went under near the buoy. Orcas heading towards fish farm area. -Susan Marie Andersson

Laura Sales, volunteer at Oregon State Parks, called from
Cape Foulweather gift shop near Newport, OR

11:30 - 2 grays, Saratoga Passage
, mid channel headed South
off Bells Beach toward Langley
. Very slow moving, a lot of deep diving, only coming to surface for 1 or 2 blows then a fluke. I got a great visual of a fluke but I can't ID from my CRC/ON Sounders book. 2 larger white marks on each end of fluke corner tips. Actually looks like Lucyfer. ??? -Jennifer Feldman Spanton
*

08:53 -
They were moving with a purpose! But I can still see them blowing down about where
Waterman Shoreline Preserve
is at
8:50am, so hopefully somebody else will get a good view.

08:15 - One grey doing the "snack and travel" routine headed south along Whidbey shore across from Hat [Island]
about
8:15am, hopefully this fin shot will help id. -Sean Nolan
[
We've ID'd as
531
from Sean's image

We are at our cabin at Witter Beach, just
south of Sandy Point
. The low tide has revealed dozens of whale wallows, which of course indicates the Grays are here! We are hoping to view a magnificent gathering on tomorrow morning's high tide. -Bob Gallaher
