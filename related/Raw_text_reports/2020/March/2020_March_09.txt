J Pod
is absolutely fascinating to watch as they seem to use different areas for different purposes.
San Juan Channel
seems to be their playground and we just sat out there watching with researchers and others as they socialized. They look really healthy, baby Tofino is spunky, Nova is full of energy and Kiki's family is taking good care of her.

I've attached some photos of an encounter with
J Pod this evening
, 3.9.20, just
south of Yellow and Low Islands in the upper portion of San Juan Channel
. The following photos are of J16 Slick, J26 Mike, and J36 Alki. Among others seen were J22 Oreo and J38 Cookie, J27 Blackberry, J42 Echo, J39 Mako, J46 Star, and J19 Shachi. Others were too distant for saddle patch photos, and I am not positive if L87 Onyx was traveling with them tonight, or not. They were moving north through San Juan Channel between San Juan Island and Shaw (closer to Shaw), and they seemed to be moving slowly (roughly 3-4 knots). There were several spyhops and tail slaps, and one orca rolling on top of another. Otherwise, there were no erratic movements or changes in behavior. Amanda Marie Colbert, Orca Network

Center for Whale Research Encounter #14 with
J pod
: "... We arrived on scene around
1320 about a mile southwest of Sandy Point on Waldron Island
. The first whales we saw were the J16s traveling slowly southeast toward San Juan Channel. J36 detached from the rest of the J16s and moved on ahead of the other three. Another whale was about a mile to the southeast of the J16s, and other whales could be seen spread out over a mile ahead of us in the White Rock area. ..."

Just saw our
first Gray of the year tonight in Skagit Bay off Brown Point, Camano
. Saw it first about
4:30, watched it for a couple hours. They come in here at high tide. Utsalady Bay and this part of Skagit Bay are shallow mud. Headed towards English Boom [Historical Park]. So glad to see one here again! -Dean Kayler

Gray's (we think) observed to the east of Hat Island
this afternoon.
3 individuals
...by appearance of the blow we think one of three was a smaller whale. -Le Schneider

13:59 - Gray whale sighting in Port Susan north of Kayak Point.
Can see from Warm Beach. Fairly far out. It looked like it was just going slightly north and towards the Country Club. -Jennifer Kelly

Back on 2/28/20 I reported
2 Grays feeding off our high bluff at Maple Grove on the north end of Camano Island
. I'm happy to report that they have been almost daily visitors since. Last night while standing on the edge of our bluff watching the "Worm Moon" and marveling at how bright silver Mt. Baker was, a lone Gray started blowing right below my feet. Today was another banner day... while out spring gardening near the edge of our bluff at about
1:30pm, I had the joy of observing 1 gray, several seals, a sea lion and a couple of otters all in the same area just off our beach! The Grays are feeding on shrimp and the rest are following schools smelt. ~Rob Plaza, Maple Grove, Camano Island
