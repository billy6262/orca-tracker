Ty Tuin called at
8:30 to report
gray whale observed at
07:40
: Lives at
Mariner Cove, North Whidbey
. He and his brother were standing out at the rocky head at the end of marina, saw the spout come up out of the water (initially thinking porpoise or dolphin). Eventually once closer realized it was a whale, pretty big in range of 30 feet. Whale traveling northeast along the coast moving really slow, chilling, just cruising along. Think gray because gray in color, barnacles, ridges on back heading towards tail, it did not have a recognizable fin of humpback, was smoother with boney ridges. Has video he'll forward. =Ty Tuin, Marina Cove
