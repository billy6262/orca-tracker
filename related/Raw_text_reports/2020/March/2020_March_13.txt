Hi! I just saw
2 whales in front of my home, roughly 2 miles away from Theler Wetlands in Belfair on South Shore of Hood Canal
. About
11:20 am 3/13. They were traveling towards the wetlands. They were not Orcas, much larger than Orca. They were not humpbacks in size...much smaller, with barnacles on the face. Sadly I could not identify exactly what they were. -Heela Patel
