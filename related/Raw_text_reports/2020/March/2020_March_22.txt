I am so excited to email you! Today, while we were on the
Bremerton to Seattle
4:15 ferry
, the vessel slowed right past Vashon for a
pod of orcas
. I've posted a video to my Facebook (Kyler McGee). I was wondering if you could give me any information on the Orcas we saw!? -Kyler McGee

14:15-

14:40 -
Addendum to earlier reports: After reviewing my video and piecing together who I saw: there were two males traveling together east of mid channel; at least one more orca well west and a bit ahead of them (perhaps the one reported to WSF); and group of female/young slightly west of and trailing the males. This all in the

14:15-
14:30 period. Did see them all continue steady southbound with last sighting around
14:40 south of the ferry lanes. From my car at
Elliott Bay Marina, Magnolia
.

14:30 - Pod of 5-6 just crossed through Bainbridge/Seattle ferry
lanes steady southbound, threading the ferries. MV Tacoma slowed earlier for the group. We alerted WSF; they also got a report of one southbound orca off Restoration Point, around
2:20, ahead of this group.

14:15 -
Who I believe is a lead group east side of channel out from
Elliott Bay Marina
includes two bulls steady skirting outer Elliot Bay, southbound.

12:47 -
Two groups: in at least 2 groups, same general areas as first two posts.

12:45 -
Correction/update. Pod has drifted west, now more mid channel. Lots of blows and water disturbance - appear to be hunting.

12:38 -
Spotted from vehicle atop Richmond Beach Saltwater Park: Pod is east of mid channel out from southern end of the park, looked to be grouped up traveling steady
southbound

- "Spouting News" - 7PM saw excited neighbors running along the beach as
3 grays were close in feeding off Mariners' Cove
. Joined in and followed them as they grazed
almost to Polnell Pt
. Where 2 spouted to deeper water showing their flukes in dives several times. While, one gray settled in at Polnell Pt. bay at glimmer of sundown; the two whales headed back to shore feeding on sand shrimp all the way back to Mariners' Cove where they began. Still, with an appetite at dark. -Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor, WA
