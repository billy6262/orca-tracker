Center for Whale Research Encounter #59: "… The
humpback
had been observed earlier to the east while
T049C
was feeding, but it appeared that the curiosity got the better of it, and it came to check him out. The pair circled around one another for ~10 minutes before T049C proceeded westward, and Mike 1 ended the encounter at 1506 (48 17.6/123 21.6)." [See CWR Encounter #59 - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-59 - for full encounter summary and more photos] -Mark Malleson

I assume it's the same whale now off of

and heading north. Choppy water…clearly visible by eyes and binoculars. -Mae Cannon

Entry 3:

12:00 -
We were kayaking one last time for the season yesterday [Nov. 1] around noon and were surprised to see a
Gray whale pop up near Polnell Point
in Oak Harbor, WA. When we first saw it, he/she was mid-channel between Whidbey and Camano Island. It then veered toward Polnell Point and
headed into Crescent Harbor
. It did not feed in our cove as they typically do. I know that our cell phone images are not great, but if you zoom in, you may see identifying marks/spots near the blow hole. Thanks and be well! -Greg & Terra Parham, Oak Harbor, WA

Entry 4:
gray in the middle of Colvos Pass
coming back from Sunrise Beach yesterday! We were passing another boat off to our port (we were in the middle of the channel) when all of a sudden, we saw a spout and its back roll right in front of them. Thankfully, the skipper in that boat also saw it and immediately cut power and made a 90 deg turn to starboard. We also immediately cut our power and then waited. We both sat and watched until it surfaced again about 100 yds away! Phfew! Goes to show, you can never be complacent driving a boat in the sound!!" There was a guy in a kayak trying to keep up with him. He actually paddled over to us after he saw us avert and asked us if we "saw a gray whale?" We told him we did and that he was moving south along the shoreline. He then paddled in that direction and most likely saw it when it came up about 100 yds in front of him. Other than the very brief sighting of its back, no other good view and nothing with a camera in hand. -Dave Hanson
