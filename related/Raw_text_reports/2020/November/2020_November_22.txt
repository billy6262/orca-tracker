BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Sun, Nov 22 - San Juan Islands - Check out these awesome photos by our guide, April, of the
T75Bs and T68Cs
. ---Killer Whales!! Up by
Spieden Island
. Sara immediately id'd
T075B
, but her sister didn't seem to be the other mom - too many kids. And Sara figured it out to be the
T068Cs
that none of us had ever seen. Second time this year to see another rare family! And it just kept getting better!! Steller sea lions were all around Spieden in the waters, when all seven orcas turned in to harass them along the shoreline. Dozens and dozens of huge Stellers were freaking out porpoising along as a huge group, ready to defend themselves against these apex predators. There was never any evidence of the orcas making a kill, but they were not intimidated by the sea lion's aggressive behavior. Even the newest kiddo was right there cruising along with the family as they rounded the east end of the island, leaving the Stellers in their wake. It was an incredible display that we were so lucky to witness. photo (all by April Ryan) - "
