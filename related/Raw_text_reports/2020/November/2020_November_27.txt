Entry 4:
Bodega Head
on an incredibly calm, warm and clear day with light winds. At around 1 pm, we spotted
a pod of about 5+ Orcas
that were roughly 2 miles west from our spot, acting as an organized unit, jumping out of the water, simultaneously spouting, and criss-crossing in one concentrated area. As that happened, south of the Orcas, hundreds of sea lions porpoised with purpose directly away from the Orcas to Bodega Rock. We then saw a nearby small fishing boat with three people on it slowly getting closer to the Orcas, until the Orcas themselves began to circle the boat. We suspected a sea lion may be on the boat, attempting to wait out the Orcas, but it was too far away to tell. About 10-20 minutes after the Orcas began circling the boat, my friend said she saw something "fall off the boat." A moment later, as the boat began to speed away, we saw a sea lion jumping next to and behind the boat with the Orcas in chase. It was over quickly and the Orcas began to criss-cross and jump and play together again over lunch. -Mike Carozza
