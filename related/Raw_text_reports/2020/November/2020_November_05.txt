============================================================

Entry 1:

10:00 - [humpback]
Today,

Entry 2:
San Juan Channel near the SW corner of Lopez Island
we saw at least one whale, possibly two, in the picture attached. What kind of whale? We are from Austin Texas and just recently bought a boat in the area so this was our first ever whale sighting. It was super exciting! Thank you! (added: All the images we sent were of the same whale just at different times. Unfortunately, no fluke images. I feel like I saw another whale before this one but didn't really see and not captured on camera. The whale was heading West and we were heading East. Quick stop to take pics and then we both went our separate ways. We can send you the original photos if you like. We were taking the images with a 70mm lens cropped in so it looks like we were much closer than we were. Definitely kept our distance.) -Sally Bradley
[I was thinking the dorsal was a match to images we have of a whale known as
Two Spot
. He's been around the islands lately and was in Haro Strait on the 4th and 6th. I just checked with Capt/naturalist Sara Hysong-Shimazu who was out with him this week and has current dorsal images showing some of the marks the older photos didn't, she confirmed this is Two Spot! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Entry 3:
12:30 - [gray]
Just now. It hung out at
Cooper Point
with about 2 dozen sea lions and then crossed all the way to my side of Eld Inlet and surfaced right at my bank/float. It continued north, near shore, heading toward
Hunter Point
. I have since lost sight.

11:15 -
Second hand report of a "large" whale heading south passed B Harbor lighthouse into
Budd Inlet
. I have not yet seen it looking across the inlets in the rain. Jessie knows. -Kim Merriman
