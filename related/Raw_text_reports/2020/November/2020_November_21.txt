Sara Frey called to report seeing
lots of orcas (15-20) that passed by Apple Tree Point
(ATP). Orcas are spread out southbound between ATP and Kingston dock, quite a few south of ferry already. Observed some breaching. She can hear them blowing all over the place. Very rare to hear them, wind needs to be just right and really calm. Could hear some to the south. Saw maybe juvenile male. At least two were closer in on Kitsap side. Have good photo of who thinks is juvenile male will be forwarding. She believes this is J pod. -Sara Frey

Entry 2:

confirmed) -

15:12 -
Saturday
November 21st.
Headed north in Rosario Strait near Belle Rock (just south of James Island) 6 or 7 orcas
. Maybe one of the new baby orcas? We saw them about a half mile away and turned off our engine planning to watch them from afar. We couldn't determine which way they were traveling. About 10 minutes passed without seeing them and then they came up right in front of us. About 6-7 together and then 1 off about a half mile to the west, closer to James Island. -Emma Hawkins

13:18 -
OMG, just saw
orcas go under Deception Pass Bridge
, 4-5, think T's - headed west. ---Today I experienced a life highlight -- completely unexpectedly. We drove up to the Deception Pass bridge on a serendipitously sunny November day (in an otherwise gloomy week). As we walked out onto the bridge, we saw a sea lion burst into view on the fast current flowing west under the bridge. He looked desperate and evasive in his movements. Soon, we understood why. To our amazement,
a pod of (Biggs / Transient) orcas appeared out of nowhere
... and we watched them chase the sea lion into the distance from our unusual aerial view. It was mind-blowing! More pictures to follow later but here's one of the better moments! -Steve Smith
photos - [
per ALB: Sara Hysong-Shimazu IDs on photo w/the four:
T37
in there.
T46

T37B1 and T37B
might be the other two.
