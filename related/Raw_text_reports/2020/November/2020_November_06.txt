Janine Harles called to report seeing large whale, she's pretty sure a
humpback

Point Wells
, Woodway. Blows getting closer so thinks whale is trending/heading northbound towards where she is in Edmonds (Marina Beach).

I'm excited to report that
Gray 2261
has not left the building after all! I haven't seen it for almost two weeks, but it popped up at
5:20pm tonight (11/6/20) just as the sun was setting, heading southbound past
Mariners Cove
, fairly close to shore. It appeared to be moving pretty slowly, and feeding (waving) at the mudflats just south of here. The attached photo is really grainy because it was so dark, but 2261 popped its head up as it passed me, so we got a good look at each other before I ran to get a camera - lol. Looks like I'm going to be on whale alert again for a while! Woohoo!!! -Marianne Parry
