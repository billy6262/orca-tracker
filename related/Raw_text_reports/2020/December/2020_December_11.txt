BIGG'S TRANSIENT ORCAS - Wed, Nov 11 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - I saw these
two [Bigg's] in Sequim Bay
on 11 November at about 1130. Posted it on ORCA Network when I returned home, but it never showed up on the website. An old orca tracking buddy, Jeff Jacobsen, recommended that I send the picture on to you. He figured you might be able to ID the pair. I tracked them for over an hour as they slowly meandered to the head of the bay. Then I left. I apologize for the picture quality, but all I had was my iPhone and I figured they get enough harassment around here without my closing on them to get a decent ID shot. Photos were taken inside Sequim Bay. I tracked them for over an hour as they ambled to the head of the bay. -Peter Jepsen
