Center for Whale Research Encounter #70: "… Initially spotted near
Pedder Bay, NE of Race Rocks
, Gord reported the whales as northeast bound for the Victoria waterfront. After stopping five minutes out of the harbour to photograph a westbound humpback, Mark spotted a single bull foraging his way north in the distance. They slowly made their way to him, the low winter sun illuminating more blows to the south and west. The encounter began at 1048 (48 20.0/123 25.1) with
J27
working northward for the VH buoy. From there, Mark and Joe began carefully working through the spread out
members of J pod

I would like to report a sighting of a
Humpback off of West Point (Discovery Park)
seen today at roughly
10:00am. At least 4 people spotted it before it dove. It was maybe 300 yards from the shore headed south. -Ben Tonelli

Going back now can match to the gray Lori Christopher had off Hat Island for sure 18th, and probable 15-17th, so he's been here a while. -alb

I was at Sunnyside beach in
Steilacoom
at it was approximately
2:15 when I took the first photo. I could see down the beach to Chambers Bay which is approximately 3 miles from where I took the pic. I noticed onlookers and a lot of birds so I kept watching. I caught something dark and snap this pic which looks like a fluke. Didn't see any reports for related sighting for today in this area so I'm really not sure. Thought I would submit to see if you may know. -Cherie St.Ours
