A pod of orcas are milling about the
Hood Canal
this week. I saw them in Union on Wed Dec. 16th about
2:40pm, as did several others. It was pouring rain so all I could see with binoculars was one large fin and movement in the water around it. They were traveling toward the bend. I later heard and saw photos on IG when they were near
Potlatch
in the early evening/late afternoon. -Jeni Gray

[orcas]
I didn't see them till I drove into Union and stopped at the marina. Saw one large fin mid channel and other movement, but I was looking through my binoculars and the rain. Happy I saw the one though! I stopped in several places from Hoodsport to Lilliwaup and never saw them again. -Jeni Gray via Harry Louch

Pod just passing
Alderbrook Resort
. Swimming south [SW]. Fast. Spread out. Bull is huge. I'd say mid channel of fjord....but wide swim spread. Many thanks to all on shore today, and for spotting help. Cheers. -Kathleen Cage
