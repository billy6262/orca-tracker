Orca Sightings for December 31, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca -

12:49-

15:39 -
"… When the animal reappeared Mark quickly recognized him as
T227
(formerly U039), an outer-coastal wanderer that he has encountered every few years since the mid-2000s. The elusive bull was foraging for the duration of the encounter, but no predation was observed. Earlier, on approach to T227, a group of animals had been spotted southeast of him travelling east. Though no obvious interaction was observed, T227 appeared to have been shadowing them before pausing to forage; he had been observed doing this with another group on
November 11th as well, the last time he was encountered. Mark and Joe departed T227 at 1358 in search of these animals.
The group had continued east, and Mike 1 caught up with them well east of T227, still travelling quickly. They were identified as the T073A and T167 matrilines, two families of four that are far more common in SE Alaska than the coastal waters of BC and Washington. The T167s in fact have only been observed in BC coastal waters five times ever! …" [See CWR Encounter #75 https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-75 for full summary and photos.]

Entry 2:
Strait of Juan de Fuca/Port Angeles Harbor (T73As T167s) -
I was on the whale watching boat on Dec.31, and I used the 2019 ID guide to identify the
T167+A+B
and
T73A+A1+A2+A3
in my camera. However, there was on very young (probably 1-2 years old) orca in the group that did not appeared in the ID guide, I think it should be either T73A4 or T167C, here are some photos. (I was on the same boat with Justine and Bart.) ["T073A and T167 matrilines, two families of four that are far more common in SE Alaska than the coastal waters of BC and Washington.
