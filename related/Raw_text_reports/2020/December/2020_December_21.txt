Hi there - just saw at least 6 orcas in
Griffin Bay
, cruising east. From our house near the old Cannery. Too far away to say how many or which pod, sorry. Pretty cool though...I think I saw 2 separate very large dorsal fins. No photos unfortunately. It was snowing and not very light at all. -Regards, Dan Whelan
