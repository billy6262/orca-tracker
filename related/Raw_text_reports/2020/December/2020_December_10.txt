----It was a surprise when
J-Pod and the K13s and K14s
showed up on the west side of San Juan Island this afternoon - but it was even more of a surprise when they went north up Cattle Pass at sunset! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Wow! Just saw one from my office window...heading south. Just
north of Eagle Point

14:00 -
More orcas passing now, so they must be quite spread out.

Entry 2:
Saratoga Passage/Holmes Harbor -

16:10 - [orcas]
They came out of Holmes Harbor heading north, on the east side, went under for a while, then surfaced and passed Baby Island. I was viewing from our neighborhood beach right by Greenbank Farm. Two guys flew a drone out to try to ID them. I think one was a marine biologist. -Deja Brandeis
*

16:09 -
They passed by
Freeland Park
and Nichols Bros going east to west, then turned up along the west side all the way past Honeymoon Bay and hugged the west side. Some of us were at Beverly Beach looking straight across as they headed north! -David Haeckel
*

15:00 -
They're now moving up/out north.
Holmes Harbor
. Mid channel-ish, at a solid swim pace.

14:45 -
We're on the lawn of the
Freeland hall
... they're on East side of Holmes Harbor!!! -Kathleen Cage
*
Always fun to see these guys come into
Holmes Harbor
- seems to become a pattern. I saw three marine mammals other than the orcas in the Harbor lately - and a lot. Harbor Porpoises every day now and of course in the passage, harbor seals as always but also California Sea Lions. There is definitely smelt here (I have images from diving off our beach and off Baby Island) and lots of Grebes diving on them. I suspect that's attracting everybody :-) keep it coming! It was already getting dark by the time I found them and I am not sure who they are - there were 10 whales for sure as you will see in this short video, there could have been one or two more. -Florian Graner, PhD, Marine Biologist
*

15:19 - Orcas
turned and are heading north out of
Holmes Harbor
, mid channel, at a leisurely but steady pace. (To clarify - the orcas were south of
Honeymoon Bay
when I last saw them at 3.19. Longish downtimes so a bit tricky assessing where they might pop up next - but they're transients, so surprise is the key.)

13:20 - Orcas
are
heading into Holmes Harbor and Baby Island
with purpose. -Sandra Pollard

Jill Hein just called to update: the pod of at least 7 Bigg's is now heading westbound into
Penn Cove
, on the northern side of the cove. She is viewing from Long Point, Whidbey.

10:00 - [orcas]
I see them slowly heading north, from my point of view, they're in front of

They seem to be napping for a while, after that meal, with long downtimes and seem to be slowly

They are still here in the Saratoga Passage milling around with longer downtimes, I counted 7 orcas now. Maybe slowly heading north, but mostly just milling around, still in front of Eagle Crest.
