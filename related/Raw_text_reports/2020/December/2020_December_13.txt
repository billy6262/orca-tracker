Sat and Sun, Dec 12 and 13 - Hood Canal - â€¦over last weekend, both the 12th & 13th, there was a minimum of four Orcas in
Dabob Bay
, one large male with a very large dorsal fin, but I personally don't have a picture, sorry for that. Also, today there were at least two southbound out of Dabob Bay, again the very large male and a smaller one, travelling quite quickly, coming up only once between our house and about 800 feet further south. We are located at Lindsay Beach which is about one mile south of Broad Spit, being on Bolton Peninsula and we face east. Over the weekend, a neighbor more than one mile north of us said he saw 50-100 dolphins [porpoises?] in their area. So, if it's of any help, there's what we saw. If a picture would be worthwhile, I can try to get one but would imagine you're aware of what transient group this is. We continue to keep watch, fascinating!! -Lynn Stewart
