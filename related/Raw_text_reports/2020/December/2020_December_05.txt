Orca Sightings for December 5, 2020
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod, K13s, K14s
) - I was privileged enough to spend time with Js, some Ks, dear friends, and new acquaintances. I had the chance to share the stories of these whales with people who were seeing them for the very first time and who were so incredibly engaged. We talked about the whales as individuals, as families, as a population. We broke down the differences between the Bigg's and the SRKW and talked a whole lot about salmon. We stopped some boats that were speeding towards the whales and watched these amazing spirits do what they do-live every day to its fullest. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

We spent a memorable afternoon with
J-Pod, the K13s, and the K14s in San Juan Channel
. For much of the time we observed a "boy's club" group containing most of the males present. There was a lot of surface activity, including this breach from
K34 Cali
. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

J Pod and part of K Pod
headed down from the north today, as if they somehow knew we needed them. On days like this, even if your mind is normally more science based, it's hard not to feel their spiritual presence. They looked like they were just having fun and socializing, much like we were doing on the boat. It was so sweet to see the group of moms traveling together, while their sons were hanging out together behind them, being boys. We were able to see both new calves in J Pod and they were active and playful. The most special part of today for me, after commemorating the anniversary of Rhapsody's death yesterday, was being able to see her Aunt Oreo, who raised her, and her cousin Cookie. Was it just coincidence that they chose to come close today? Perhaps. But my heart is completely full and my soul received some much-needed therapy. -Cindy Hansen, Orca Network

There is nothing more amazing to see than killer whales in the wild. These are Southern Residents - all of
J Pod with the K13 and K14 matrilines
. They were in a very social/playful mood with lots of breaching, spyhopping, rolling and rubbing. It was great to see the two newest babies looking healthy and rambunctious with their moms in this big family. They do a lot of healing for the soul without even knowing it. Magical Creatures. -April Ryan, Maya's Legacy Whale Watching

Center for Whale Research Encounter #67: "… We got on scene at
1210
as the whales headed south around
Sandy Point on Waldron Island
. It was
J pod along with the K13s and K14s
and they were in small groups and singles loosely spread at first but the groups began spreading out as they turned toward San Juan Channel. The whales were active and there were several tail lobs, pec slaps and a few breaches. We caught glimpses of most of the whales present during the first pass south of Sandy Point and then went to work going from group to group trying to make sure we got a photo of everybody present. …" [See Encounter #67 to see full summary and photos] - https://www.whaleresearch.com/2020-67

From
Point Robinson
on Saturday, Dec 5th. I think the large male is
T75A
, a first-time visitor to the Puget Sound from Alaska. The pod was traveling south towards Tacoma and included a baby... I could have had a few better pictures if exuberance at seeing these magnificent animals so close hadn't caused me to freak out with excitement. After 28 years in Seattle, numerous whale-watch trips with no luck, I finally met these visitors here. -Tom Haveaford
