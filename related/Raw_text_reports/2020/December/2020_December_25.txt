So close in! The little
humpback
feeding 50' from shore 1/4 mile
south of Edwards Point
. Trending north he went from bait ball to bait ball until he was 350 yds out, then submerged and I didn't see him again. Up close his skin is much lighter than what I had thought! He's very quiet when he exhales. This humpback has been observed frequenting SJI shores since 11/29 (possible sighting 2-3 days earlier). He has a triangle pattern of 3 dots on his right side. (I noticed a third injury on the little humpback down the curve of his spine past his dorsal. I looked at the previous sightings photos and didn't find any that showed that part of his body. It possibly happened at the same time. The wounds seem to be healing well.) -Michelline Halliday, SJI
