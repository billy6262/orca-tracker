Orca Sightings for November 23, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
. With heightened awareness of their presence,
November 24 brought forth fruit - heeding Orca Network's call we spotted whales north of the Kingston ferry heading north along the Kitsap side as seen from Possession Head, Whidbey Island (a distance of approximately 3 1/2 miles across the water). Mesmerized by a succession of fountain like blows against the hazy background of
Point No Point
, we hedged our bets as to whether they would maintain their current travel path or repeat their recent behavior and change direction at that point. Seems a consensus was reached before they had gone too far beyond Point No Point; the whales turned, continuing steadily southbound along the peninsula once more in their never-ending quest for food. -Sandra Pollard

Just after last update several
J pod
members slowed way down, with a few foraging. Since they were making directional changes I walked down to beach to get closer look, but once here no orcas near and could only see few fins in the far distance in wide expanse out
from Fay Bainbridge and Carkeek still southbound
, but at slower pace than past hour.

14:15 - Js
in general, have been difficult to see, but suddenly at least 8-10 surfaced in tandem in large spread out V-ish formation on east side of channel out from south end
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
, looks like many have moved over to this east side of the Sound. One breach more mid channel. And a frog croaks to my right. Love nature.

Jefferson Head
with lone male, on east side passing Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. Steady southbound; seas calming a bit.

13:44 - Orcas
still coming with more just now passing Kingston. They are spread great distance N/S (at least 30 minutes spread so far) in groups 1-5s with some mid channel more to west side towards Kitsap. Al still steady brisk pace southbound in semi-rough seas. Males are spaced across channel.

13:18 -
I have seen just a few orcas so far,

a pod of orcas off the Vashon ferry route

about 4 of them
according to my very excited mom. -Frolicking Farms
