Happy Thanksgiving... Ever hopeful of seeing whales on Thanksgiving Day, we were not disappointed. With Facebook down we didn't get the initial 7.20 am alert of whales south of Bush Point until late, but a quick scramble (amazing how the power of the whales can get us from slow to overdrive in seconds) had us arriving at
Fort Casey at
10:20 am in time to see a dozen or so whales in two or three groups northbound on the Whidbey side
as they passed Ebey's Landing. The orcas were in steady travel mode with one or two breaches, eventually disappearing from sight into choppier seas. Such a special gift on this beautiful clear day. Photos, zoomed and cropped by wildlife photographer Miles Away, simply do not do them justice (thanks Richard Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard

Thu Nov 28 - Mark received a call at 1512 from Gord Rowles who spotted a group of killer whales south west of Victoria harbour from his 23rd floor apartment building. At
1553
with the help of Gord who was tracking them from shore they located what looked like
6 or 7 individuals
surrounded by gulls 5 nm southwest of the
entrance to Victoria harbour
. They immediately recognized
T099B
and could see that the
rest of the T099's were with the T036A's
.
