Good Morning, I just caught a glimpse of the
tip of a dorsal
through the fog. Looked like an Orca, not sure. About a mile or so North of the Edmonds/Kingston Ferry crossing on the eastern edge of the NB traffic lane. We only saw the one, and it really was just a glimpse in the distance through the fog. I would guess it was SB based on the direction it was pointed. -James Greenway
