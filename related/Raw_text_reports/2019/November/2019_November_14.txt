============================================================

Entry 1:

They are on the

Stealth whales... They
arrived (
November 8) unobserved into central/southern Puget Sound
...they left (we think) today,
November 14, with a long gap between a
report of them in Possession Sound
in the morning until
a sighting of them passing Lagoon Point, Whidbey Island, early afternoon
. A quick dash to Fort Casey was rewarded by seeing
members of J pod and Onyx (L87)
travelling individually, in pairs and at least one group of three, steadily northbound against an incoming tide in the soft silver light of early winter, portrayed against the backdrop of the Olympic mountains and the sheen of a glassy sea. Passengers on the Port Townsend/Coupeville ferry packed the front and stern of the boat to catch a glimpse of this iconic species as they traversed Admiralty Inlet with occasional tail-slaps and breaches, hopefully finding much needed food and nutrition to sustain them on their travels as the days grow shorter.

14:18 - Orcas
. Ferry slowed for trailing groups. Still spread out. Seem to be midchannel,
leaders pushing NW and approaching Fort Worden area

13:55 - Orcas starting to group up Whidbey side.
Couple of groups spread north to south and east to west. Northbound edit: some on Port Townsend side too. Long downtimes still. -Rachel Haight
*

14:05 -
I'm at
Port Townsend Marine Science Center. Can hear faint calls via hydrophone
. Ferry is passing now. Not sure which direction to look, haven't seen anything yet. -Shannon Mary Paul
*

13:55 -
Lots of repeated
S1 calls in low background noise via the Port Townsend Marine Science Center hydrophones
. -Scott Veirs, Orca Sound
*

13:55 - Sounds like faint K-pod calls on PT hydrophone
. -Brittany Noelle Philbin

I managed to see the Orca whales from Edmonds Wednesday 11/13/19 and believed them to be heading generally North. Thew were constantly shadowed by a small red boat that seemed to be too close to them to be legal (was NOAA under permit -alb)...The following day, 11/14/19, I spotted
Orca whales from Fort Ebey
on Whidbey Island heading North consistently. They seemed to be bunched closely together and often surfaced simultaneously with no breaching behavior observed. There was no boat traffic and the water was very calm. -Robert Gray
*

13:41 -
Clear
calls on PT hydrophone
while the ferry is in the dock. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network
*

13:44 - Orcas.
Steady travel northbound spread out long down times approaching ferry lanes; no boats in sight in either direction so definitely listen to the calls!

13:22 - Orcas mid channel still south of ferry lanes. Viewing from Fort Casey
. -Rachel Haight
*

13:44 - Over the past half hour have heard S1s and what sounds like S6s, S10s, first part of S9
(as is in Veirs catalog)

13:12 - Port Townsend hydrophone: J pod S1 call.
Also at
13:01 thought I also heard K like call as well, but could be Js acting all K like as they do sometimes. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

13:00 - Faint calls on PT (hydrophone)
in some whiney boat noise. (Follow up from Scott re calls on both PT and Bush Point: In low background noise, typical detection range for SRKW calls is 5-10 km. The distance from the PT hydrophones to Admiralty Head or Marrowstone Point is about 6.5 km.) -Scott Veirs, Orca Sound
*

12:57 -
I just heard
a call on the Bush Point (hydrophone).
-Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

12:30 -
I spotted
a single orca swimming north past Lagoon Point at
12:30 PM
. -Earl Overstreet
*

12:28 - Orcas. Lagoon Point, north bound
, mid channel, large group, blows and breaching. At least 5. They were spread out with a very large one following behind. -Benjamin Potter
*

12:20 - Orcas.
Rec'd a call from Debra Hegg about
2-3 whales including 1 or 2 males, seen south of Lagoon Pt., briefly, trending north
.
*

08:57 -
Definitely more like 15+ animals, just a very wide spread....Also a single
Minke Whale just north of buoy SE
, in the middle of the spread of killer whales.

08:50 -
Good morning, I am unsure of the exact number but there
7+ Killer Whales in the Separation Zone between the traffic lanes off of Possession Pt.
They appear to be headed Southbound. It looks like the group is fairly spread out between buoy SE and SF. The Victoria Clipper V is with them now (0850). -James Greenway
