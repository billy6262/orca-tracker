Orca Sightings for November 26, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tue Nov 26 - Ks & Ls - Strait of Juan de Fuca...They left Victoria harbour at ~1430 and worked their way out to the east of the last known location (48 20/123 18). It was tough slogging with the strong north east winds and 2-3 foot chop but
at ~1500 they spotted north east bound killer whales in a tight resting group
with help from Gord Rowles who had a lock on them through Big Eye binoculars from his 23rd floor apartment. They started the encounter at 1506 (48 21.2/123 15.3) and quickly were able to identify
members of K's along with most of the L's including L87
. The presence of L87 explained how Rod and crew assumed J pod was present. The whales were traveling between 3 and 4 knots on a line for Middle Bank in a tight resting formation... Full report and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 95.

Entry 2:
J pod - Puget Sound -

15:27 -

16:10
- J pod is still
south of Point Robinson
, but visible and coming north. Bundle up, is bone chilling frigid out here.
Added later: They were spread in three groups from mid channel to west side of channel then grouped up in a beautiful resting line. A tanker came through and disrupted their line,
they all continued northbound
, moving slightly more west towards us at the point. As they approached the point, they grouped up in tight with one another, was so beautiful to see all those bodies close together rising above the chop of the seas and tanker's wake. The pod continued steady northbound in pretty rough seas chins pushing above waters surface, they loosened up a bit while passing then point and by
16:10 they were north of the point, still loosely group as they continued on to the north. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

First group approached the point ~
11:00 including series of tail slaps. Others following in groups of 1-4s and as they passed the point, they moved offshore towards the sunbeam and Mount Rainer. Most whales remain west side of channel with
others including J27 more mid channel

traveling steady southbound
. Some spyhops, breaches, tail lobs, rolls, but mostly in travel mode. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

We were lucky enough to get to spend some time on the beach watching
J pod
whales as they passed. Extra bonus was that our poop sniffing and whale loving @ConservationcCanines dog friend Eba was there. -Amy Carey, Sound Action, Nov 26, 2019

Entry 5:

10:55 -
After watching them to the north of
Point Robinson
for about an hour milling and making directional changes, at least some of the orcas have resumed southbound travel spread out across the channel.

10:33 - Orcas have stalled and are making directional changes north of Point Robinson
. #ebatheorcadog waiting patiently!
So wonderful to spend time with Eba the Orca Dog and her person Deborah Giles (both heart-melters) while waiting patiently for
J pod
to come south and watching them pass Point Robinson. After Js cleared the point Eba responded in work mode as if she smelled some whale poop, and she probably did! Eba now has the job, previously held by Tucker, of sniffing out whale poop for research for Conservation Canines. -Photo collage by Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network, Nov 26, 2019

11:02 - Orcas
. They are about
a quarter mile north of point Robinson
, with A steady southbound track. I believe they will go close by point Robinson.

10:59 - Orcas.
They are just
north of point Robinson
, at least the leaders are. They're coming up on the cable Crossing. From where I am it looks like they are still mid channel but closer to the Vashon side And maybe they are trending closer westward, but still southbound.

10:55 - Orcas
. We are definitely heading southbound now there's a group of two that are in the lead. Then I see the male which looks to be alone behind them. A quarter-mile back are about five whales grouped up

10:46 - Orcas -
What I think are the leaders just north of the cable Crossing. Saw a few tail slaps and what looked like a spy hop.

10:20 - Orcas.
