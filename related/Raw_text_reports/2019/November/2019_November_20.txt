Think I saw him
(gray)
tonight around the same time off Picnic Point... it's definitely
a guess
! Now that I'm looking at more photos, it
could've been a humpback
too. I saw a sliver of its back surface twice, heading north along Picnic Point maybe 50 feet out from shore. Fairly slow-moving. Had a nubby dorsal fin and was the only one in the area I could find. Color was tricky as the sun was setting but looked dark grey. -Sarah Elizabeth
