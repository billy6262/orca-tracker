The whole pod has clear the ferry lanes, committed
heading up Colvos
at a quick pace. Although now there's a pleasure boat trailing them pretty closely. Any chances of enforcement being around?

I'm not sure (how close to Ruston Way)... I'm trying to head in and can't see them.

There's a group in front of coastline law our CI Shenanigans on
Ruston Way.

14:25 - Orcas. There are a lot of whales out here, and very spread out.
One of the groups is doing circling/splashing activity thatI've seen transients so before. Do we know if there's possibly a transient pod following the residents? (I'm in the little gray boat and have seen this activity between us and the white whale watching boat.)

14:11 - Orcas.
They are just south of that white whale watching boat. Visible from south end of Vashon, should be visible from Tahlequah shortly. Still heading south, slowly. -Shelby Middling
