Hi Alisa! Hope this finds you doing well, thank you for all of your awesome updating! I was heartsick to miss their Island pass by earlier this morning, but was able to catch up to them at dusk as they passed
Point Robinson
for their evening exit! It was such a beautiful pass, love hearing their breathing and watching the small groups cuddle puddle together, especially
Onyx and Blackberry
, as they moved North. Such heart bliss to see them again!

The pod came into far off view at about

12:45
. They went along
Vashon island, down to Point Defiance
(I almost went home at that point) I could barely see them as they traveled past ... They had a research boat w/them. I noticed that the boat and pod got to Point Defiance stopped and changed course back my way, cutting over to Ruston then
into Commencement Bay
being very active and playful. It felt like they took forever moving down one side of Commencement Bay over to my side at the Browns Point Lighthouse.

Entry 8:
09:02 - 2 orcas (1 male, 1 female)
, likely Biggs, seen from the
Coupeville/Port Townsend ferry
headed northeast towards Fort Casey! The male is clearly an adult as he has a very impressive dorsal fin! ...Unfortunately I was traveling alone and this was the best photo my phone could get by the time I got up on deck, I do remember a funny shape of the males dorsal fin though so I can do some looking in my books and verify if it's similar to one of the J16s. The ferry announced them when they passed us so I'm sure someone else got a photo, maybe ask their ferry folks? -Jennifer Huntley
(
possible this is
J16s
exiting Admiralty split from rest of J pod/L87 who remained in Puget Sound. J16s were picked up next day off Race Rocks - alb
