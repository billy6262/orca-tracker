My friend Dave and I were fortunate to encounter
about a dozen orcas heading slowly northbound off Apple Cove Point
spread out mid-channel at
8:44 am on Veteran's Day. Initially in the distance they were breaching, but some males came close by our boat as we sat adrift, so amazing seeing their large dorsal fins break the surface. Wonder what his name is?
