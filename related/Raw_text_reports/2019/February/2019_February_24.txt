Orca Sightings for February 24, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound Gray CRC53 fluke and left side - Possession Sound....Making our turn south, we met back up with
Little Patch
and discovered that his solo swim had come to an end.
CRC-185
had now joined him, and the two traveled side-by-side, at one point seemingly surfacing on top of one another....Island Adventures Feb 24 Blog Post
