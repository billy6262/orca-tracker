Orca Sightings for February 4, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Admiralty Inlet - An amazing sighting. (originally reported as an orca)... upon further study of the whale sighting, I'm convinced it was
Humpback
based on the photos I've looked at. The small fin on the hump of its back was clearly noticeable...surfaced about 20 feet from the shoreline on
Admiralty Inlet
today at

4:30pm
. Our house is on
Keystone Avenue
about a mile south of the Coupeville ferry. It traveled north toward the ferry rolling and surfacing and spouting. There is a break in the driftwood barricade in front of the house. I just happened to be looking out and saw it surface at the opening. It was beautiful! Couldn't catch a glimpse of any markings. Dark, shiny black. The sun was in the low western sky so I saw it spout numerous times up to Ebby's point. Then lost it in the sun, but I did see further spouting looking directly West close to Indian Island headed south about five minutes later. Tall spouts. But couldn't get any identifiers. Did not report to Orca Network. Weren't we just talking about never having spotted one close in on Admiralty east side at yoga last week?!!!! One in a million close up sightings for sure. -Leslie Warren

Entry 2:
13:10 -
Just saw what I believe is a single
humpback
moving north past
Three Tree Point (Burien)
at
1:10...She wasn't close to shore this time and I spotted her without binoculars. She would come up for air two times close together and go down for a longer period. Saw her do this twice before moving past the point. -Sandhya Ballal
