T100E and T100F

orcas
I saw earlier today, now they're exiting
Thatcher Pass towards Rosario
...(re; direction) I'm not sure , I'd guess south, but they dove down and didn't surface as our ferry (I'm a captain for WSF) slowly went up their starboard side before I could tell for sure. VIDEO (Facebook)

along Shaw Island towards Orcas Island @

Entry 3:
(
Each of Brad's videos morn/afternoon show female, two bulls, & young one. Melisa Pinnow, CWR reviewed both videos and notes: "the two males
almost look like T125A and T128
but it is hard to tell. Hopefully they will show up again tomorrow...I guess it could be the T85s too. Who knows!" - alb
