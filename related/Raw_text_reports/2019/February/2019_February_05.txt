Orca Sightings for February 5, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
(Despite many efforts in freezing temps by hardy individuals, including Center for Whale Research staff, no one could successfully locate
J pod
who could be heard on the hydrophone pretty much all day. A morning sighting of orcas off Eagle Cove could not be confirmed if Rs or Ts - alb)
*

20:10 - hearing one orca
making a short call much closer to the
Lime Kiln Hydro
, as well as some more distant echoing calls. -Cassie Barclay
*

17:42 - Distant J pod vocals
can be heard on
Lime Kiln hydrophone
! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

16:46 - Definitely SRKW!
-Monika Wieland Shields
*

18:02 -
I may have mis-ID'd the calls initially as S02ii or they're making both SO2i and S02ii as I'm now hearing S02i. Possible since J makes both calls.

17:39 - SO1 calls
now.

17:34 -
They did just a moment ago (sound louder), I'm now listening from my desktop at home and they were sounding clearer. Quiet at the moment but that's how they've been...on and off since I first started hearing them.

16:44 -
I think I'm hearing
S02ii calls
... So
SRKWS

16:36 -
I've been hearing faint calls on and off on the SMRU
Lime Kiln hydrophone since 1540
. Hard to make out and still trying to figure out ecotype. -Kyla Graham
*

15:30-

17:38 -
Guess what? They didn't go very far. They very faintly started over the
Lime Kiln HPs
at about
3:30...you can hear them a bit better right now. My guess is they have been down in the 'big water' all day...no telling what they will do next! Yes, J Pod!

03:15-

06:00 - RKWs on Lime Kiln
, distant at
3:15 a.m. By
6:00 a.m. it was
clearly J Pod
, and they were quite clear and loud over the Lime Kiln hydrophones. It will be interesting to see if/when they are located. Had they been north and came south? Had they been west and came in? Inquiring minds are so very curious to know!! -Jeanne Hyde
*

Entry 2:
17:45 -
I could hear several
exhales to the north of Eagle Point
at
5:45pm. (Distant J pod calls were heard on LK hps at this time ,and through the day, but there was no visual confirmation on this group or Lodies morning group -alb)

09:00 -
Several
whales came by Eagle Cove
at
9:00AM this morning, they were very spread out, headed south, stalled for a while off of Granny's, did a little back and forth routine, then turned and headed north (out of our view) by
9:30. And poof...where did they go? I did not get photos. They were off shore, spread out, and directly in the glare of the sun so I can not confirm if Ts or Residents. -Lodie Budwill
*

Entry 3:
16:11 -
Fairly small
humpback
about 10 yards from shore passing
Richmond Beach Salt Water Park
at full speed. Was not able to get any pictures because he was moving so fast. Heading northbound towards Edmonds. -Anastasia Nicolov
*
~

13:45 - Humpback, Northbound
, close to shore. Passed pier 70 and Olympic Sculpture park. -Vicki Brown
*

13:43 - Humpback in Elliott Bay
. We just watched a humpback cruising north along the shore of the Olympic Sculpture park, heading towards the grain terminal. Sorry, no photo. -Cheers, Bruce Moore
*

13:36 - Humpback
whale Northbound in
Elliott Bay

Entry 4:
*

13:32 -
My husband said he was able to see the
whale
from his downtown office that faces out over the waterfront. He saw it when it was out by the
Aquarium
. -Allison Brock
*

13:20 -
No (photos), short surface time, but we just saw it again heading NE, will try to get a picture. Stephanie Raymond.

13:13 - Small humpback southbound
, just a few dozen yards off the Seattle waterfront! Surfaced once off the ferris wheel, once off Ivars, and I'm hearing folks on the water taxi say they see it continuing southbound. -Stephanie Raymond
*

13:15 -
Burt Miller, MMO at WA State Ferries also reported this
humpback at
1:15 pm
, near Coleman Dock, within 15 - 20 yards of the floating dolphins at slip #3! It first headed south, then turned and headed north in
Elliott Bay
. Work was stopped on the Coleman Dock project while the whale was present, and they contacted the workers at Pier 62 to alert them of the whale's presence so they could stop work on their construction as well.
*

12:00 -
Just saw something big just south of
Alki
, headed North. I'm guessing it was the
humpback
, but I'm new to whale watching. I'm a bird watcher, so I wasn't prepared to ID a whale. I thought the blowhole was tall, not flat, but then again I was so shocked at what I was seeing I could be totally mistaken. -Sara May
*

08:09 - Humpback
? headed west towards
Owen beach
just now. Almost to the ferry lane. -Kellee McLeod
*
Humpback
was in area again today

08:15 at Owen
, closer to

08:55 at Tahlequah
. Seemed to follow ferry from Owens Beach to Tahlaquah terminal. Surfaced a half dozen times near the dock itself and along side ferry. Again hard to get any photos because I'm on duty. A number of commuters did see it. Sounds very little time on surface and lack of seeing the fluke during dives, makes it hard to identify. Seems small in size also. Thanks. The couple times I have seen it, it hasn't seen it's fluke, even on long dives. -Wayne McFarland, WSF
