Entry 3:
15:30, we could see no orcas to the east or west. We then searched from beaches along west Whidbey beginning at Deception's West Beach and ending at Swan Town during daylight hours and in excellent viewing conditions with no luck. Having arrived after Amy's
14:20 sighting we presume pod headed west towards the San Juans and was just out of sight ahead of our arrival - alb)

2:20 - Last sighting
through binocs

2:20PM- hugged Deception Island then continued south/southwest
.

1:00 - BWs southbound - guessing Ts (turned out to be
members of L pod
-alb) - estimating 6/7 in pod -At
Washington Park
- 1 PM - slightly SE - could be headed under Deception Pass bridge?! ...so tough to tell (if a calf with group) - females/youngins stayed offshore and way ahead of the two HUGE bulls...definitely a good 4-5 females/kids ahead of these guys...They went west
through Guemes Channel
and played
in front of the Anacortes Ferry Terminal
before hugging WA Park...They first caught my eye from afar when they were romping around - breaching and tail slapping -
just to the east of - but close to - the ferry landing
in Ship Harbor before heading west and hugging the park. Still in shock. Wish I had better footage of the others for you! Other people from Anacortes are saying there were around 10 of them. Sounds like they were
first spotted on the west side of Lummi
, south of Lummi rocks at

10:30AM this morning
. See Facebook Video. -Amy Eberling

Entry 4:
15:58 - There are at least 4 Grey whales off the east side of Hat Island
. No direction, just diving.
Grays have been spread out between Hat Island and Snohomish Delta
all day today. With the flat calm water I can clearly see the blows and surfacing from my house near Howarth Park. -Ryley Fee
