I saw
a whale next to Coleman dock
at about 5pm on Monday, Feb 17th. I was on the Bainbridge Ferry and we were loading. It surfaced just north of us, about 50 yards from the dock. It didnt have a large dorsal and appeared to be about 20' long. Dark grey and few barnacles or discoloration on the fluke so I assume it was young. I've never seen a whale this deep in Elliott Bay. Is that odd?......Sadly no photos. I did shock another ferry rider, when I showed him. The whale was a very dark gray, had a very short fin on the back (not large dorsal), and had almost no barnacles which surprised me. I just figured it was very young. And I think a humpback because I didn't see ridges along the spine leading to the fluke. -Adam Nilsen

14:00 - Young grey whale at Colman Dock
...Not certain (gray). Seemed small and was whitish under the fluke. I only saw it briefly but my husband saw it all three times it surfaced. Very close to the docked ferry...No images. Husband said bit of bump when it surfaced. Then they made us leave the boat. Several people saw it. Sorry not a confirmed sighting. -Susan Smith Mitchell

Hi there, sending over info about a whale sighting in
Commencement Bay in Tacoma
, just south of point Ruston. I was in the car and saw it come up and spout, just sort of appearing out of the water. Then a minute or so later saw a great big tail fin as it dove down heading towards point defiance/colvo's passage. No big dorsal fin. My best guess is that it was a minke. Just thought I'd share! (probable Gray) - Dan Wickens
<(
Both gray whale and humpback were in this area and had some crossover in time -alb

I think I saw a grey whale off
Les Davis pier in Tacoma
, today at 2 pm....(direction) toward the port but i think it looped back. Also I guessed grey whale bc one was sighted further north recently. Could def be a different type. -Heide Fernandez-Llamazares

Looks like a humpback in the water by
Duke's in Tacoma
. It was hanging out near the shore - we didn't get a visual of its direction when it left. (Eating with one eye on water - must have missed it)...Got a clear view of the tail but no pics, unfortunately. Judgement was based on prior sightings of humpbacks and similarities but am by no means an expert. -Kate Kirby Boss

I am sorry that I didn't get pictures! We saw a
humpback/grey whale
surface twice, heading south from
Browns Point lighthouse
. Yesterday 2/17. At around noon. It seemed to be heading towards Tacoma/Ruston. -Matt Sasson
