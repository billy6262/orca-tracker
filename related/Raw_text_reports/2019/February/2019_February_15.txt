, I'm only seeing one individual (
gray

Can see blows in the distance from
Hat
this morning...closer to Everett delta trending south, too far to tell (if same whale

09:27 - GRAY WHALE in Possession Sound
heading south toward Mukilteo. Very close to shore on
Everett/Mukilteo side

Entry 2:
11:45
I was out taking pictures, and saw the container ship outbound from
Maxwelton Beach
. I enlarged it and think they are porpoises or even 2 orcas. What do you think? -David Welton
(
Great shot! I wish these were orcas, but looks like they are
porpoise
, but also be aware we have several dolphins who have been bopping around the Sound, though their fins would be a little larger and more curved -SB
)
