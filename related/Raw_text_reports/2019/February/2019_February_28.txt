============================================================

Entry 1:
Here is a photo taken 2-28-19 of
grey whale divots on the beach on the east side of Holmes Harbor
, 1/2 mile north of Beverly Beach. This is the earliest in the year we have seen signs of grey whale feeding. -Photo by Bruce Schwager, Feb 28, 2019

Entry 2:
Grays have been spread out between Hat Island and Snohomish Delta
all day today. With the flat calm water I can clearly see the blows and surfacing from my house near Howarth Park. -Ryley Fee

10:00 - Another gray
in the same area
SE of Hat
this morning...Lori Christopher.

Entry 3:
Dash Point park
. (Not state park) and it appears to be a baby grey whale or humpback whale. Can you confirm? (INSTAGRAM VIDEO of gray whale going under Dash Point Pier). -Thanks, Melissa Harrington

12:15 - A gray whale
swam right under my feet at the
dash Point pier
... I was told you would be interested... it was about 15 feet offshore in just about 10 ft of water heading toward the lighthouse (Browns) from the Dash Point pier. -Tim Valdez

Entry 5:
08:00 -
I saw what looked like a whale spouting off of
Ruston Way in Tacoma
this morning at
8:00am, but wasn't able to stay long enough to see anything more...I only saw the spout, but it was a lot smaller than what I've seen in the past -- only about 2-4 feet high, so I was unsure. I didn't see anything other than that, but it definitely looked like a whale spouting. -Melissa McCleery Brewster
(
possibly the gray who was filmed in afternoon off Dash Point - alb
)

Entry 6:

16:20 -
While on the ferry from
Clinton to Mukilteo
I spotted
at least 2 Harbor porpoise
swimming eastbound in glassy seas several hundred feet from shore as we neared Mukilteo. I then drove over to Edgewater Beach park (east of the new ferry terminal under construction) in hopes of seeing grays in the distance, no luck, but saw porpoise again swimming around off the beach. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
