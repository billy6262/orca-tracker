Orca Sightings for February 20, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:30 - Humpback whale
spotted in the
Port Gardner area between Jetty Island and the Everett waterfront
today at approx
10:30 am. It made 2 passes, north to south, breached 4 times, and was last seen heading south and back out to Possession Sound....It looked like a hump/bump on it's back when it was out of the water - very clear for all of us to see as it was within 30 feet of us. It wasn't fully out of the water, we could see about 2/3 of it, but it seemed to throw itself into a low arc and rolled it's body while going back under water. -Cat Levitsis

Entry 2:
07:04 - humpback
moving north at a fast pace past
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
. About 20 yards from shore, right through a group of sea lions! Sorry, wasn't quick enough to snap any pics. -Anastasia Nicolov

Entry 3:
10:49 - (bottlenose dolphin)
It stopped and milling around. I got a couple long range shots of the fin I'll post soon and maybe someone can help identify the species

10:40 - Been at Edmonds
for a couple hours. No humpback, but a lone small dorsal heading towards the south east end of whidbey. I suppose a
dolphin
or porpoise. -Kevin Crosby
(
ID notes: Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective (CRC) reviewed these images as well as video and frame grabs by Stu Davidson from where he could confirm ID of this
bottlenose dolphin as "Stump"
. See her story at CRC's update HERE
