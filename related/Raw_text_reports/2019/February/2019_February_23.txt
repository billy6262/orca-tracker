Sat Feb 23 ...As "Orcinus" putted out of the harbor, "Sea Lion" was seen nearing Kellett Bluff and Ken was also out in "Tonto". "Orcinus" headed southwest out of Mitchell Bay to try to find the group Jeanne had seen. Jane called on the radio to report that the three whales who had passed her place were the
J19s and that was who was probably near Kellett Bluff
. After about 20 minutes of searching, Dave finally saw his first whale mid-strait off Mitchell Bay. This was
J39
who foraged a little before passing the boat and continuing north... Full summary report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 12.
