We think we heard some blows around

correction.
Large group of at least a dozen east of mid channel out from Richmond Beach
. Looks like many of mid groups and the trailers bundled up together. Super beautiful in waning light.

18:35 - Lead orcas are mid channel between Jefferson Head and Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
slow trend
southbound
while still foraging, others trailing all spread out doing same. Good night residents of all type.

17:45 - Leaders are just south of Kingston dock
area southbound in southbound traffic lanes. Others spread north and east. A LOT of foraging/ directional changes while continuing slow trend south. I have now seen 3 males so far. I do believe they are residents, which ones remains a mystery for now. I've not seen any east of mid channel.

17:15 - I've seen at least 2 male orcas
out here. One foraging
off Apple Tree Point
, 2nd male more towards mid channel northeast of Apple Tree Point with the 3rd group. He is steady southbound so tall and regal looking.

17:05 - I just spotted a third group of at least two orcas even further north of the 2nd trailing group.
All groups making directional changes while trending southbound from my vantage at Kayu Kayu Ac Park, Richmond Beach Sure acting like residents. We notified WSF earlier.

Fri Oct 11 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - my last day of the season on Glacier Spirit. First we found an elusive
minke off McArthur Bank
, then
two lovely humpbacks mid Strait of Juan de Fuca, off Dungeness
. One for sure is
Two Spot (MMZ0013)
and the other we couldn't pin down. Beautiful layers of clouds and mist on the Olympic Mountains. "Breaking News".....2nd whale is
most likely Divot (BCX1057)
with a lot of sun glare on her tail fluke. -Bonnie Gretz
