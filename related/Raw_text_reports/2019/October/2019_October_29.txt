Orca Sightings for October 29, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait - Js & Ls coming down from the north.

Entry 2:
Js and some L pod whales off Turn Point
. Dave then called Katie and they met at Snug Harbor in the early afternoon. We got on scene off TipTop Hill on Stuart Island just a little before
1330
. J pod and the same Ls that were encountered on
October 24th were spread out in singles and groups across Haro Strait heading south.
J26
was the first whale we encountered as he traveled southeast along the Stuart Island shoreline by himself. About a half mile behind him was a group that included the
J22s, J35s, L47s, J27, J45, and L90
and they traveled down Haro Strait in a tight group...Full summary and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 89.

In case you missed it:
J-Pod and a few whales from L-Pod made their way down Haro Strait
this afternoon. While I was taking behavioral data on shore, our volunteer Heitor Crespo was recording their vocalizations via the streaming hydrophones all the way from Brazil! I'm thankful he was, because the vocals were great - here's a 3 minute sample. Hearing these calls sure brightens up a chilly autumn night!
L91 Muncher off Lime Kiln this afternoon.

Still loud at

sweet calls and whistles
, such lovely sounds to listen to while making soup on this very fall-ish evening. -Marla Smith

18:05 -
just heard a few
calls on the Lime Kiln Hydrophone
again - yes! Some more now, listen in to the hydrophone below, and we believe they are headed N up San Juan Island, so later they will likely be heard on the OrcaSound hydrophone. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

HUMPBACK WHALES - Tue Oct 29 - Haro Strait...We headed across the strait toward a couple of blows near
Halibut Island that turned out to be a pair of humpbacks

humpback had traveled up mid-Haro Strait
through the southern residents a little earlier...Center for Whale Research Encounter 89 (encounter link in SRKW section)
