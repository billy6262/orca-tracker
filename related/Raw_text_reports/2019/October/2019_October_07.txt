============================================================

Entry 1:
J38 Cookie
, with his beautiful distinguishing rounded dorsal, gliding the waters
off Sooke

Entry 2:
Orca were off Sooke
this morning we came across members of
J Pod, J27 Blackberry and Seven-year-old J49 T'ilem I'nges, J38 Cookie once again
feeding heavily but after a few minutes of looking at the first pictures we left the scene and notified the amazingly responsible members of the Pacific Whale Watching Association to continue our stewardship with cooperation with Transport Canada to ensure the best outcome for these special endangered Killer Whales! Somewhat bitter sweet...Paul Pudwell
