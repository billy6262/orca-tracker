. Close in at first, the family was grouped together and making long dives. It looked like they were hunting/foraging for a few minutes before they left as a group moving away from the island to the west until out of sight. Close up - those fins - remarkable! -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Wow! What a day on Chilkat! We started the day with a seal and a lion's mane jellyfish in the Edmonds Marina, then we headed up to the San Juans! We stopped at Whale Rocks and spent some time with the Steller Sea Lions (pics to come), there were also a mated pair of eagles there and one took flight (flight sequence included). Then we stopped at
Spieden Island
where we saw some of the exotic animals on the island Mouflan Sheep, Fallow Deer and a Sika Deer! Around the corner we found the
transient orcas T18 & T19s
! On the way home we stopped near Lime Kiln lighthouse and played with some Dall's Porpoise! Great day on the water, thanks Captain Christopher!! -Janine Harles

Entry 3:
a Minke
. It was off
Apple Tree Point
on 10/2/19 going
northbound
. It was close to the Kitsap side...maybe 200-300 yards off shore. Behavior was like the Humpbacks, up 5-6 times in a row and then a deep dive and down for 5-10 minutes. My neighbor said she saw it out in the channel last evening but didn't know what it was. -Sara Frey Photos by Sara Frey, Oct 2, 2019
