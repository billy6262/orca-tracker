Orca Sightings for October 25, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Fri Oct 25 - Discovery Bay, WA - Alisa, I have telephoto pictures of
mom and baby orca playing in Discovery bay today around
1:45 to
2:45 pm
. My name is Becky Hogle and I reported my sighting to Langley Whale Center and they suggested I contact you.. used my Sony RX10 camera which takes great pics. but you must still ZOOM in on the pictures,but then the pictures and markings are quite clear. I have around 40 good pictures, but will first send 12 pictures to start with so you can identify the pod and baby . and then let me know if you would like further pictures. I will send my pictures in an attachment a few at a time because of the size. -Sincerely, Becky Hogle

Fortunately Becky managed dozens of great images we forwarded to the Center for Whale Research, but due to distance and resolution they were not optimal for solid IDs on all orcas present. ID notes by Dave Ellifrit: " The
T137s, T137A and others...
are certainly in there but I can't tell who the others are." Below we've included just a few from Becky - alb
