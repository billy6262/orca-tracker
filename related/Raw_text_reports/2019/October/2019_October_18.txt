Our journey took us all the way up to the Turn Point Lighthouse, as this seemed to be the place where all the whale action was unfolding.
Two humpback whales
, Big Mama and a companion, were circling the area, likely foraging at depth. Meanwhile, not half a mile away,
two pods of Bigg's killer whales
were busy socializing. It turned out to be the
T37As and T99s
, ten orcas in total. We cruised with the pods as they continued north into Canada, spread out across Swanson Channel in groups of two or three. When we made our turn south, we met back up with Big Mama and her friend, who gave us several good looks at their flukes. -Day reports w/images at Island Adventures

. Seen from WSF on way to Sidney from Anacortes today, we were heading west and they were heading west. There were
