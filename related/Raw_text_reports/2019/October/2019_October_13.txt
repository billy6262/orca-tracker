Entry 10:
from Lopez Island down to Port Townsend
in our sailboat. Just wanted to report a couple whales we spotted today. First, we saw
a humpback
midway through the strait, hanging out, meandering Eastward. A couple breaths and then a deeper dive. S/he did this several times until we were out of sight. Then, near the west end of the VTS circle north of Port Wilson, we spotted
a Minke whale
surface to breathe several times before diving down. Much more of a purposeful eastward movement to his path. Including the only 2 photos that we took. Sorry, they're not great. Thanks! Hoping those orcas continue northward to Port Townsend today!! -Be well, Rachel Messerschmidt
