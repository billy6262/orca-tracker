Entry 3:
7am
Saturday Oct 5th and saw
2 whales breech several times just a little north of Kitsap Memorial Park
. They were headed out of the bay. Thanks for the great website!...FOLLOW UP: I'm confident they were orcas. They broke the surface, not breach. Thanks for clarifying. I'm not so good at estimating but would put height of fins at 3-5, and both were same height or very close. I was between orcas and shore and a small sea lion came swimming quickly toward shore (me) with a fearful look on its face. It was Tuesday when I finally had opportunity to look up more online and found your site. I live in Montana but grew up in Washington...this is the first time for me to see an orca in wild. Thanks for the site and information! -Lora Kruse
