Orca Sightings for October 12, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
18:27 -
On the ferry just pulling into dock at
Mukilteo
and spotted lovely
huge male orca
out from south end Mukilteo Lighthouse Beach! Watched him rise and submerge a few times. He is southbound well on east side of channel. Will check for more once off Ferry. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

15:15 -
I am at
Point No Point
now, and have been watching for around 3 hours. I have not seen anyone go north of PNP much beyond Maxwelton. Around

2:00 there were 3 males
pretty close together looking like they'd committed to traveling N up Admiralty roughly off Maxwelton. From Norwegian Pt
around
3:00 I could see 3 blows off Possession Pt
, but they were way over on the east side of the shipping lane, north of Edmonds, I could not tell what direction they were headed, as I only saw the blows a couple of times. I did go back to PNP one more time, but saw nothing from there. -Laurie Arnone
*

15:00 - Two or three orcas
appeared to turn back south before reaching the yellow marker (
south of PNP
). Has anyone on Kitsap side seen whales pass Point No Point? Wind getting up and sea conditions a bit choppy here on Whidbey making whales harder to spot.

14:30 -
Viewing from Maxwelton Beach. Dorsals and blows passing yellow marker
south of Point No Point
as whales
continue north
.

13:00 -
Seeing blows and dorsals northbound on
Kitsap side
plus research boat. Viewing from near Cultus Bay on Whidbey. They are heading
toward Point No Point
. -Sandra Pollard

Distant
Southern Residents (J pod)
northbound on the
Kitsap side of Admiralty Inlet as seen from Maxwelton Beach
, Whidbey Island. Some did pass Point No Point and apparently foraged for a couple of hours or so (thanks Sara Frey) while others turned round before reaching the yellow marker south of the point. -Reports by Sandra Pollard, Photo by Richard Snowberger, Oct 12, 2019

Yes! Sorry, super busy day but we definitely had
Js
and we left them foraging but generally trending north between
Point No Point and a Possession Point
. We confirmed ID of
J27, J31, J56, J40, J16, and J42
. They were very spread out. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

14:33 -
Donna and I are freezing but one male is teasing us by coming slowly west. Trying to last out here to see if he keeps coming. Leaving... too cold. They are still out there. Very slow trending north. Lots of foraging

14:21- Orcas
. Still out in front of
Point No Point
. Yes I'd say committed (to Admiralty). Very little progress north.

14:10 - Orcas
. Now moving north again mid channel. Lots of foraging still.

13:45 - Minke
is here too! They (orcas) are really stalled at
Point No Point. J27 and L87
northern Puget Sound proper backdropped by South Whidbey.
J pod
came by the house late yesterday afternoon and then again this morning. I followed them up to PNP and watched them forage for several hours until my fingers and toes had enough of the cold north wind. They were still there feeding when I left so hopefully they stick around for a while. -Sara Frey

13:45 - Orcas
. 3 males milling and a
minke just north of Cultus Bay
.

13:25 - Orcas
. Some directional changes over by research boat, others northbound Kitsap side of mid channel- they are kind of spread out without a clear purpose

13:16 -
Multiple blows near research boat, Male and female
Kitsap side
of midchannel, large male leading
btwn PNP and possession Pt
looks committed to Admiralty but still pretty far out - binocs or long lens required

12:25 - From Point No Point orcas mid channel south of PNP way N of Edmonds/Picnic Pt
. breach and blows/surface activity and directional changes. Looks like possible research boat w/ them but they're too far over to confirm that- multiple blows around that boat. Plus more orcas well south of us more on Kitsap side. -Donna Green van Renselaaar

12:13 - Eglon. 3 orcas
. 1 male. Heading north towards west side of Whidbey. (

We are on our boat in
between Point No Point & tip of Kingston
. They're here. Heading west towards Whidbey. I'll update if I can get a better view. -Courtney Castle Adams

I can see them now

Sppotted a group of
3 more orcas
, east side of shipping lane, all trending north east

Eglon

12:49 -
One group east with I think research boat. Big group SW of that with males. It was a male with large finger saddle on left side that I was watching.

11:58 -
Definitely residents. Saw saddles for sure. Saw either
L87 or J27

Sat Oct 12 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - during a tour with Maya's Legacy Whale Watching, we were fortunate to spend time observing the
T46B's
, including gray
T46B1B (Tl'uk), due south of Race Rocks
. I'm posting some pictures of the encounter, partly just out of general interest, but also because I am wondering about the extensive scarring I noticed on T46B1B. In particular, there appear to be areas of broken skin on the top of the tail/fluke. Any idea about the probable cause of the body scars and apparent tail wounds? -Dave Berliner
*
...out into the
greater Strait of Juan de Fuca
. It was near the Rock Pile that we found a
T-party
to rival all T-parties. What was likely
over thirty Bigg's Orca were making their way into the Salish
. It was hard to know where to look. We spent some time with the
T37As
, a pod of six with a new calf in the mix. We also confirmed that the
T123s and T99s
were present. In communicating with the other naturalists that were on scene, in total it sounds like the
T35As, T38As, T49As, T51
, and some exotics from California were also in the mix...WHAT. We got to spend some time with these three California Transients...See full Island Adventures report

3:30 pm, a lone humpback
transited quietly and quickly eastward through Active Pass. Photos taken from the shore of Galiano Island.
Humpback whale Hecate BCX0470 (known female) Active Pass.
