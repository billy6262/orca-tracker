Orca Sightings for October 6, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Sun Oct 6 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - From Georgia Strait we went all the way down to
eastern Juan de Fuca Strait
to be with the
T18's and T37A's Bigg's orcas
. The first sight on scene were the two big males in the
T18's
. These guys are GIANTS...The Bigg's were mostly traveling with little surface activity but there was a little lunging/porpoising...The orcas are
29-year old T19B (born 1995) who is the largest male orca I have ever seen with six-month old T37A5 (born spring 2019)
. Love when the big guys get babysitting duty...At about
5:45 PM we left the
T18s and T37As
at the south end of Eastern Bank angling toward Admiralty. Whidbey Island may want to keep an eye out. -Debbie Stewart

Entry 2:
humpback we encountered in Georgia Strait
(British Columbia) was BCZ0345 - Victoria. Further north in Georgia Strait we encountered
BCZ0345 Victory, BCZ0345, BCX1358 - Frankenstein. "Frankie"
was a complete hoot. He was doing some feeding behaviors using his entire body -- pecs, tail, etc. to spiral and twist to round up food. He was also trumpeting.
As we were ready to depart Frankie another humpback started approaching from the south. We stopped and waited just to see if the two animals would come together. Next thing we know... Frankie who was several hundred yards to the north of us and the animal who was approaching from several hundred yards to the south were together at our boat! We got mugged by TWO humpbacks. There was one on either side of us. It was absolutely incredible. Every time we thought they had tired of holding us captive and started to ease off, they were right there again. I've never experienced anything like it. The second
humpback
involved in the mugging was
MMY0079 - Scratchy
. I got one fluke shot of him and he was pooping! -Debbie Stewart

Entry 3:
08:26 -
Janine Harles called to report
a humpback
thought to be juvenile foraging around in the area off
North Edmonds
to Possession Bar (South Whidbey). Originally thought there was a 2nd but she could not confirm other than just the one.
