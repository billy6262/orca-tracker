============================================================

Entry 1:
21:46 - Grey whale (I think)
at the bow of the Turner Joy in
Bremerton
... to dark to see for sure, but a single whale coming up several times for air. Pretty awesome! -Jason Jbone Swanson

Yesterday morning (Oct 4) at
7:45 am my husband and I saw
a whale
headed south in front of our home about 100 yards from shore. Location:
between Redondo and Dash Point, just north of Dumas Bay, north of Tacoma
. I am not sure what kind. Not orca for sure. I don't think it was humpback either. Through the binoculars it appeared to be a light grayish brown. More brown than gray. It spouted a few times and was traveling near the surface with just a small area above water so it is hard to judge its size. It seemed 30 feet or less but there could have been more beneath the surface. It blew 3 times swimming near the surface and then dove. No fluke appeared when it dove. It was down for a few minutes before appearing again. Repeat. Then gone. I tried to find a photo online of something that looked similar but no luck. Can you recommend a resource for photos that would help?
ADDITION: No dorsal fin was visible. I am certain of that. I realized I had t mentioned that after I sent and almost added it in a separate email. I would say it was
probably a gray
if not for the seemingly smaller size. Though as I said, I may have seen the tip of the iceberg. The coloring was modeled. I saw a gray here in March for sure that was only 200 feet from me and I could see the barnacles. It seemed much bigger than this one though. -Thanks, Barbara Nus
