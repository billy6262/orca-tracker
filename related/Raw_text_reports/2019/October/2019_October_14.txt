Oct 14: We were with Puget Sound Express on the Red Head on 10/14. When we arrived at this spot just
south of Bush Point
, the Saratoga was already there and they were watching orcas to the northwest, closer to Marrowstone side. If you zoom in on the boat, you'll see no one is even looking at the orcas that eventually approached from the south, initially anyway. Once those nearby orcas passed by, Saratoga backed up and left.
The orcas were trending north, spread out, and some were very active. We saw a couple breaches, a couple cartwheels, tail lobs, and I think I have a pec slap photo somewhere in here. The captain said the one group of them were in a resting formation. Some of the names I heard mentioned were Tsuchi, Tofino, Kiki, Blackberry, Mike, Onyx, and Shachi. I
*
think
*
I was able to identify Mako, Notch, Tsuchi, and Tofino so far, but it's my first time seeing them (but been following for years) and trying to identify them.
We were in this area, south of Bush Point, from

10:37 a.m. to
11:25 a.m
. (according to the timestamps on my photos) then we left because the captain said he wanted to try to find some humpbacks, which we did find
2 juvenile humpbacks further south, off Hansville
but closer to the Whidbey side. Then we had to head back to Port Townsend and on the way back saw the
orcas again for about 5 minutes at
1:35 p.m.
. They were now further north,
near Lagoon Point
, but they were moving south at this time.
J31, J56, J49, J47 Notch, J37, J39 Mako.

Viewing from Whidbey in the area of Scatchet Head and can see a good succession of blows as they maintain along the

toward Eglon

east of Eglon

October 14: As I post these photos taken of northbound
Southern Residents, J26 Mike, passing Bush Point
