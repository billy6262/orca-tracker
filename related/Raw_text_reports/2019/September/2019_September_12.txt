14:40 -
We saw what we assume was the
juvenile humpback from the Kingston ferry
yesterday... 4 big blows and 2 nice flukes. It was at around
2:40pm. There seemed to be a boat trailing it... maybe a small research vessel? and the whale was north of the ferry by maybe 400 yards (I'm a poor judge of distance but an excellent whale spotter... haha) nearer to Edmonds but heading towards Kingston. We may have been the only people on the ferry who noticed it. -Kris Jones
