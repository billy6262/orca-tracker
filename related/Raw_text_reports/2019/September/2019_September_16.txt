Orca Sightings for September 16, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
20:27 -
It was beautiful to hear so many whales approaching the point, heading towards
south beach/salmon bank
as darkness fell. Exhales like a lullaby!

18:56 - At Eagle Point
now, can see fins/hear exhales far off shore, pointing south....Here they come,
approaching Eagle Point from north
! Wow! -Lodie Budwill

Mon Sep 16 - Strait of Juan de Fuca...Knowing of another group of whales further to the west that our sister ship was with, we continued onwards. We met up with this group in the
middle of the Strait, between Port Angeles and Victoria
. It was a pod of
four Bigg's Killer Whales, the T99s!

Entry 3:
Humpbacks Titan (MMY0048) and Merlin (MMY0038)
in glass smooth water about 15 minutes out of
Pt. Townsend
! They started out just traveling, then Titan went into a tail-slap frenzy! And Merlin did a huge breach, which I not only didn't get a picture of, but didn't see as I was (literally) focused on Titan's activities! Titan has a large (fist-sized) hole on the right side, just ahead of the dorsal fin (per Erin Johns Gless it's from a sat tag). We finally left them, and later learned they pretty much disappeared, so we were lucky! In the afternoon, we went under Deception Pass Bridge, found a brown pelican just outside the bridge, and found another humpback (MMY0149) in the fading light. Fantastic trip, thank you Puget Sound Express! -Bonnie Gretz
