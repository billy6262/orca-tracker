Entry 2:
11:35 -

12:15 - Haro Strait, SJI. J Pod
observed from shore. 8-10 orca, including 2 large males foraging across from Hannah Hts. They were to my left (south) but 3-4 individuals moved north to my viewpoint long enough to get a few photos of saddle patches. I saw
J27 Blackberry, possibly J44 Moby
. J Pod was foraging in small groups over a large area. The groups were very spread out. Foraging activity included milling about; often quickly changing direction and backtracking; short dives followed by a longer dive; splashing in tight circles. Very interesting to watch! The orcas slowly moved away from my position to the south and away from the island. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Thu Sep 5 - Hi Alisa and Orca Network, During our (PacMam) routine observations for harbor porpoises and harbor seals in Burrows Pass (off Fidalgo Island) on Thursday, Sept 5th we were treated to a unique sight, a
Minke whale
! At
10:45am the whale travelled east
along Burrows Island
, disappeared for about 10 min in the bay, then came up travelling back out West to Rosario strait. Never seen Minke here before - very exciting! I have attached a picture (unfortunately it didn't come too close, so may not be able to ID it.) -Best, Cindy Elliser, Pacific Mammal Research
