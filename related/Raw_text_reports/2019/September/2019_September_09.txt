Orca Sightings for September 9, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
J16s from 6-730 at Land Bank
tonight as they slowly made their way west. They were first reported around
530-545 in Hannah Heights
as folks were just getting home from work. Amazing to see the four of them show up on the Westside exactly one year to the day from when they were first seen without J50. Like they came in just to have a family memorial for her. I cried. I came here this weekend to have a personal memorial for Scarlet, so the fact that they showed up exactly one year later as well (and only them) just blew me away. There was a moment early today when I closed my eyes and I was Slick and the three kids were nuzzling my face. We surfaced and SJI was in front of us. Then I opened my eyes and was me again. So eery. -Ariel Yseth

17:00-

18:36 - Haro Strait, SJI
. Observed from shore.
4 orca including 1 large male
traveling very slowly; barely breaking the surface; quick dives; then disappearing during long dives. They were far out traveling from
Hannah Hts to the N/NW. At Edwards Point they turned west away from the island until out of sight
. The late day sun made it hard to see saddle patches but I think they were
Southern Residents
. At

5:45pm they were heading back in at Point Edwards
then
swung to the south to Hannah Hts and out away from the island
. Very very slow, very beautiful. Try as I might, due to the late day low sun, I only managed to take some really dark photos of the saddle patches. I think I saw J26 Mike. The male had a beautiful thin almost wavy fin, if that helps. If you can help confirm ID, that would be appreciated. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Mon Sep 9 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - ...From there we made a foggy cruise to the western reaches of the Salish Sea and eventually got visibility back around
Hein bank
. Not long after that we joined the
T46 orca
whales just outside of Ediz Hook in Port Angeles and followed them east. Not long after joking the pod we had a few very close passes as
T46E and T46F, Matriarch T46.

We live on E. Bluff Dr. in
Eastern Port Angeles
. We spotted first the whaling tour boats and then saw
two Orcas
going by....They came buy at 3pm. The only identification that seem different to me was that the dorsal fin seemed thinner than others I have seen. -John Temple
