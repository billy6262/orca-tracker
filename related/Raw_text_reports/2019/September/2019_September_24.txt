Orca Sightings for September 24, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod, K13s, & L87
- Wowww!! You must be so busy with all this srkw activity! After chasing them from shore for a couple days, I finally caught up to them yesterday for their first Island Homecoming of the season at
Point Robinson
and watched them cruise through
Colvos Passage
. My heart is full, it was absolutely beautiful watching them forage right in front of the beach, and that sweet spyhop from
J37
was pure bliss! Looking forward to seeing them again soon! The above images from the west shores of Vashon Island as
Js, K13s, & L87
pass by on their northbound travels through Colvos Passage in the late morning into early afternoon.

Unclear if they were going to head east or continue on NW....there were only 3-4 and had intermittent prolonged down times. You likely needed some binoculars to see them as they had moved east as Donna showed on the map. We could hear their blows for a quite a while though. -Sara Frey
