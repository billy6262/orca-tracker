19:48 -

20:45 - Haro Strait, SJI
- Observed from shore.
7-9 orca including 2-3 large males
, far out & spread out around
Edwards Point
area. Changing direction between south and north the orcas were moving in slow motion surfacing often. The sound was carrying beautifully across the sea, I could hear both inhalation/exhalation and the tail slaps sounded like firecrackers. 5 orcas moved inland gathering near a still sailboat. The sailboat didn't move and the orcas lingered for 10 minutes before moving off to the S/SE. The sailboat didn't pursue as the orcas slowly made their way, through the stripe of moonlight on the water and away past
Hannah Hts to the S

Entry 3:
T137A 137 137B 137D as well as T036A T036A1 T036A2 T036A3
The two gangs were well into some common mure hunting with big zig zag type behaviors, lots of surging into and away from the beach line, tail lobs etc as they chased the Mures.
T137A
was showing his injury just forward of his peduncle and just below his fluke, still lagging behind the others (I had been off water all day but knew he was around and had heard he was on his own for alot of the mid afternoon period) but as the hunts progressed he came in with everyone to partake. He got into some of the celebration and did around 4 very small attempts at a tail lob. I managed to capture one decent image which I have edited and shared here with the photos. Lots of work goes into these encounters, edits etc...one am!! Please share respectfully with credits. -Nick Templeman,

T060E, mom T060 and her new calf T060G, T060C and T060G - oldest and youngest of the "kids," T060C and T060D

Entry 6:

Hi saw
pair of orca
in front of my house in
Sekiu
. Traveling too fast to get any markings on them. They were working the kelp line in a westerly direction. Last I saw were rounding Sekiu point. This was the first time we have seen orca in our bay . A brief but exciting experience. -Jim (Willett) Brown
