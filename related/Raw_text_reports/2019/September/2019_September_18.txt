STRIPED DOLPHIN - Wed Sep 18 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - As if last week's rare sighting of a Fin whale wasn't enough fun for one day, a sighting yesterday (18th) may very well top that as
one of the most unusual sightings we've had in several years here in the Salish Sea
. Karac Lindsay, a naturalist and photographer with Eagle Wing Tours in Victoria reported seeing and photographing a
Striped Dolphin in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
: "On our
morning
tour (
September 18) we came across a lone striped dolphin at

9:57am approximately 4.1 NM South of Victoria
at 48 22.066 and 123 26.762. Judging by its breathing pattern and overall behavior, we think it was foraging, but all of us onboard are not familiar with "typical" striped dolphin behavior. It was coming up for 6-10 breaths and then would disappear for approximately 5 minutes before surfacing again. It was mostly circling in the same spot, but we were only able to stay on scene for about 30 minutes or so." -Karac Lindsay
