Orca Sightings for September 28, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
15:45 - Large orca just south of Dodd Narrows
coming south from Nanaimo. Single solo very large. Dorsal 6 to 8 ft high? Seemed to be going in circle in no particular pattern or direction. (T77A was reported by PWWA at 1700 south of there - mws). -David Rhine

Sat Sep 28 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Out on Glacier Spirit for our last full day trip. A bit rocky on the way up to Friday Harbor, but then the wind died down and the sun came out. After lunch, we zoomed down to
Victoria to catch up with the T60s, T60C (b.2001) and little sis, T60F, born 2012, including baby T60G
, first seen in August...the first "G" designated calf! They were traveling north through Baines Channel. The surprise of the day, however, was at Discovery Island.
T60G Baby!! with Mom T60, born 1980...maybe her last calf of 7! First two are not around.
You'll see in the final photos! Thanks for a great season, Puget Sound Express! -Bonnie Gretz
