Mon Sept 2 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Another Killer day with a T Party off
Race Rocks
! We had around 18 Transient Killer Whales socializing and milling...(
Possible Id's being T042A's, T109's, T123's, T018 &19's
). Then we visited many
humpback whales from Race to Sooke
! What a great day to share our back yard again! -Paul Pudwell
*
With that, we moved on to the shores of Vancouver Island, just
west of Victoria
where we met up with several killer whales in hunting mode. Only, it wasn't just any hunting. This was a really large group, made up of
two different pods
, maybe more, who were in Pedder Bay hunting common murres and rhinoceros auklets!! I was only able to make positive IDs on some of the
T109As and T100C
but the majority of the bird hunters were the T109As while T100C traveled along the rocks near the shoreline...Renee - Island Adventures (See the day's blog reports HERE)

15:00 -
Great Orca action today at
Point Roberts
- small group of 4-5 came through around 230 pm travelling super quickly - one calf - heading north and not surfacing often. Then at 3 pm - 20 mins later - we have a large group of 7-8 whales. Lots of action with tail lobbing, spy hopping, charging, even some logging. Thanks! -Sandra Scott

Entry 3:
Strait of Juan de Fuca
- We picked up speed after we passed him and found
two humpbacks out in the strait
. These two were staying down for almost 10 minutes and dive angles made it a challenge to get ID's but at least one of them was "
BCY0785 Mathematician
". We stayed with these two for a few dive cycles and when one of them went down, we expected the other to follow but instead the surface erupted with "Mathematician" in a full breach! -Renee, Island Adventures

...Then we visited
many humpback whales from Race to Sooke
