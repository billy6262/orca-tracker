FIN WHALE - Mon Sep 9 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Good morning everyone! My name is Wendi Robinson & I am a naturalist with Puget Sound Express in Port Townsend. I was aboard the Glacier Spirit on Monday,
September 9th when we encountered the
fin whale off of Dungeness
. Jill Hein was on board with us the following day & mentioned that you would all probably like to see some of the photos that I took. ...Hope that these are helpful in some way. Follow up: Unfortunately, the photos that I sent are as much as we saw of the animal. We did not ever see the head / jaw come out of the water. I'm hopeful that some of the other boat captains and/or naturalists on scene were able to get additional photos that show more of the animal's body? My guess is that
this animal was approximately 65-70
' long. Glacier Spirit is 72' in length & the animal appeared to be (roughly) the length of our boat...possibly a bit smaller. -Best, Wendi Robinson
Notes by researchers & entanglement team responders:
Looks very much to me like the entanglement wounds we typically see on fin whales (especially at the peduncle). The diagram attached is very speculative - but there's clearly a split (or gangeon or end of twisted lines) in the gear at the left dorsal fin - and most likely the weighted gear (such as to a pot) runs down the left side given the size and angle of the wound there. There are certainly other entanglement configurations that could have caused this - but it's likely something along these lines. ...The whale most likely has shed the gear - but more images - especially of the mouth-line and peduncle would be great to confirm this. -Doug Sandilands, SR3 - Entanglement example courtesy of Doug Sandilands, SR3 w/ images by Wendi Robinson & Taylor-Rose Chapdelaine.

...Animal looks quite emaciated and in poor condition....Thanks for sending that perspective and that is more consistent with a fin whale. Regarding the injury it does look like a potential entanglement scar but agree it is somewhat unusual in no coming further down forward, I wonder if this was more a rope scar dragged over the animal rather than a wrap. I CC Doug Sandilands who I know had some thoughts about this injury and cause. -John Calambokidis, Cascadia Research

I've attached the best photo of the right side of this
fin whale
that I have received so far...The angle that the dorsal fin rises from the back is much more shallow here than in the photos from the left side, perhaps due to photographer position or a lean in the fin. In any case, it's a much more classic fin whale look and all things considered, is pretty convincing....Jared Towers, DFO

Beautiful Northwest Day at the beach! We saw the post about
a small group near Port Townsend
so we ran down to the beach to have a look. I saw 2 boat with lots of people on board but didn't see any Orcas for about 7 minutes. The water was flat, I was standing on the waters edge getting my boots wet when all the sudden the water started bubbling up, big bubbles...I wasn't sure what I was seeing so I backed up and that's when
a giant fin came up out of the water
!!!! They went past at a slower pace, I believe the females and baby in front and the male in back. They came up a few times before disappearing for another 5-7 minutes. Looking like the females went to the left side of the channel to hangout and the male was hunting a Steller sea lion and flipped direction back
over to Fort Casey. lovely beings sharing the shores... T137B - T137A - T137D
. We saw a big Sea Lion swimming in the area after that who looked pretty beaten up. Alisa, it was incredible!!! So happy I had that experience and can share it with you! Have a great day!

14:59 - Just saw him and the rest of the T137 just north of Port Townsend
...I'm not sure how far north exactly but I believe they were traveling in the southern direction. I think it was around Point Wilson? I was on a whale watching trip with my class. -Katline Barrows

Entry 5:

Marie w WS Ferries Ops called to report
humpback in the middle of shipping lanes Edmonds/Kingston
appears to be heading towards Kingston. Capt believes is "resident" that comes down stays for a bit then heads off...
Found this
humpback near Point No Point
this morning (see images below). It was in the area Saturday as well, today we got to watch a run in with this newbie and Two Spot. I believe it was
Two Spot
that breached and trumpeted at this one. This HB does not have an ID number that I can find. He took off
towards Kingston
at a high rate after the run in with Two Spot. This one has an "x" at the base of the fluke and a hole in the top part. -Janine Harles
