Orca Sightings for September 22, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS
Puget Sound

Entry 2:
J pod, K13s, L87 -
(A family traveling home at the end of the weekend encountered the residents in Puget Sound. This is an excellent example of respect and mindfulness towards marine life we share these waters and proper Be Whale practices when in the presence of orcas )
Received on Sep 23rd regarding sighting on Sep 22nd:
Hello! I didn't want to clutter your facebook feed but I do have a question. After 20 years of boating, we finally saw our first pod of Orcas in Puget Sound yesterday (so exciting!). We were on our way back to Elliott Bay Marina after spending the weekend in Poulsbo. We left Poulsbo via Agate Pass and as we were entering the Southbound Puget Sound traffic lanes we saw a dorsal fin about 400 yards or more to our port side and then another to port but behind us, then another just in front of us about 500 yards away. We were only going about 9 knots at the time but I slowed to about 3 knots to see which direction the whales were headed. We kept looking all around the boat and then saw one whale headed directly for our stern so we stopped immediately and drifted until we were sure that they were all headed South. I noticed that they seemed to be heading towards the West side of the channel so we stayed to the East and continued our trip South but still at 3-4 knots. The majority of the time we saw the whales we were traveling parallel to them in a Southbound direction. My question is, when the whale was headed directly towards our stern, did we do the right thing by stopping and waiting for them to pass? I want to make sure we're following the regulations correctly. Our boat is a 50 trawler and we don't have great visibility of the stern unless one of us walks back and looks around. Thank you for your help! -Sandy Dupleich
