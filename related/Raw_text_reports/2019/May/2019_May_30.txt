============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Thu

Entry 2:
New little J pod calf off Tofino, BC!
...we got word from Tim (The Whale Centre) and Jeffrey Tom (Jamie's) that there were
Killer Whales 4 miles off Lennard Light
. John and I headed out on the Lil Salty to go out and see who the whales were. We got on scene and determined that the whales were in fact J pod. -John Forde and Jennifer Steven, Tofino Whale Centre

May 30 - (ID notes from Alie Perez, Cascadia Research: This animal is the same one seen in Penn Cove on the 27th by the Agudas and by John that day as well. And same as seen by Wiese by
Edmonds beach
. I'm assuming that the sightings today are most probable to be the same individual. I took through the catalog and didn't find a match so I have now made it
CRC2256
. - Alie

20:31 -
I just heard blows from possibly two whales heading north from liberty bay in agate pass. They were on the move. The reason I think it was two whales is that one blow was big and one was smaller, and they were close to the same time for the 6 times I heard them. My hunch is that they are the same
whales seen in liberty bay

19:00 - Whales are in Liberty Bay
again today. -Dale Mitchell

17:02 -
He's about 100 feet or so I would guess from that big white boat on the right (by marina). We are floating in our kayaks a few hundred yards away so it's sort of hard to tell but it seems like every 10 minutes or so he surfaces and takes three or four breaths with a couple minutes between each and then goes back down again. Moving very slowly. This is the marina in front of oyster park and he is just to the right of it. -Lisa Coffee Sand

Late report but I observed
Gray whale
in same location
Liberty Bay
, just logging at surface/milling about 200 -300 yards south of Liberty Bay Marina & Yacht club. I'm concerned about the whale's condition due to lack of energetic movement or very robust blows. I could audibly hear a few blows today but couldn't see spouts. I did see a couple of surfacings and stress avoidance behaviors when up to 5 boats approached super closely and trapping the whale in between two vessels - I have made a report to Stranding Network and NOAA Enforcement. Those behaviors included changing direction and swimming away, as well as vigorous bubbling from blowhole. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

13:35 -
He is currently out in front of
Liberty bay Marina
. -Dan Bracher

Just
south of Liberty Bay Marina at
6:45 this morning
....I couldn't really tell a direction. It was staying in the area just past the south breakwater of liberty bay marina. I watched for about 10 minutes just before
7am
(
Liberty Bay gray, now known as CRC 2256.
) -Ashley Nicole

Entry 4:
Boundary pass
where we stopped to watch some slow moving harbor porpoise. Out of nowhere,
Divot BCX1057
, a large
humpback whale
roared out of the water!!! We hung out with Divot as it traveled east along Saturna and actually brought us to another Humpback whale. After many great flukes we discovered it was
Geometry or BCZ0338

Entry 5:
17:57 -
It looked like a
dolphin
to us. Small fin. On the Bremerton to Seattle ferry....We were on the
5:30 ferry
from Bremerton to Seattle.
The animal that we saw was headed west. Picture of location to follow. Time seen was
5:57pm. I tried to video but he/she went under so you can't see it. Def not a humpback in my opinion as we've seen humpbacks and this animal looked about the size of a dolphin. It had a small fin and looked black or dark grey in color. A few people saw it on the ferry as well. -Loba Perkins

Entry 6:
17:30 - Small whale headed up Colves passage
northbound spouting loud sharp small
curved fin like a dolphin
. Too big to be a dolphin. Slow back coming out while spouting. Girl Scout camp. Hard to tell because I didn't get closer. I play by the rules. 20 footer maybe. Wasn't a humpback I know that. I heard it spout over my radio it was pretty loud breathing. -Brian Kelly
