confirm
2 grey whales
, one smaller, one larger drifting/logging at surface just south of
Liberty Bay Marina
. Followed very closely (from 50-100 yards or so to within 25-30 feet) by large sailboat at slow speed, causing whales to swim away/avoid and change directions several times. When boat returned to marina, whales ceased traveling and logged at surface. Drifting generally south. Seemed lethargic. (did see two bodies/blows at same time?) no but we are fairly certain we saw two whales separated by the boat that was chasing them. The smaller appeared to have a lighter coloration and the larger darker. I'm going with a little less than 100% certainty but double checked this morning with my friend who had binocs and she said yes 2 she was pretty sure and described same as above/ larger dark coloration smaller whiter rostrum/body...One of my photos showed a prominent divet between the head/rostrum and body. Poor quality pic but i'll send later - not sure if it would be an indicator of poor body condition- also one photo appeared to show spinal ridge but again- I'm not a gray whale body condition expert so I'll refrain from drawing conclusions.
Gray 2256 in Liberty Bay.

Confirming
grey whale still in Liberty Bay
just about 50 yards south of Marina/Oyster Bay Park at Lemolo - 150 to 200 yards out traveling N & S, several surfacings and blows, ladies watching from porch say two whales 1 lg + 1 small possible calf. I only saw one. Pleasure craft/yacht within 50 yards of it...its been traveling back and forth N to south from
Keyport area to Liberty Bay Marina
. I couldn't tell body condition but it had a somewhat robust blow while I was there as well as several gentle surfacings. The one I saw looked like adult size. I kept missing the blows with camera but did get a surfacing sequence that will hopefully show a little more than that iphone snap of the cam back. The other one reported by locals was reportedly small/calfish. -Donna Green Van Renselaar

Saw this
gray whale
at
12:20 pm, just east of
Liberty Bay Marina
, on our way back into
Poulsbo Marina
. Blows x 2, then surfaced briefly enough to see it was a gray, no hump. Mid bay. Was in same area for blows and surface. Watched several minutes and could not see it again, so don't know direction. -Beverly Steinman

Saw a
gray whale 2256 in Liberty Bay
,
10:47a Wed the 29th. There didn't seem to be a direction... it had just come into the main portion of the bay as we were headed out - not as far as the first marina. Went across our bow first and we shut everything down. Then was on our port going the same way, but not in the channel. Tall spray, barnacles and grey, no fin. -Dana Brooks
