Today was my first trip into the south Puget Sound on Chilkat Express of this year! That's where we encountered the
T65As
traveling and playing in
Colvos Passage
. It was such a pleasure to see them after several days of no orcas in our range! Later, we went north to find some of our
Gray Whale "Sounders" still hanging out near Everett
. We saw
#49 Patch and #723 Lucyfer
up close and a few others off in the distance. Patch even fluked multiple times! -Justine Buckmaster

They (orcas) are traveling

08:20 -
Kitsap Fast Ferry vessel Rich Passage has sighted
a pod of orca north of Alki
and moving in a westerly fashion, approximately
8:20am. At least one orca repeatedly bobbed its head above water several times before the pod seemed to take to deeper water. -Matt Spurgin
*
Didn't see this on twitter but this morning on my
commute in from Kingston
on the fast ferry we saw
a pod of orcas
breaching from the ferry. Seems like they/we were
east of discovery park
. There was a large ship (cargo I think) south of both us and it. Couldn't get a great count but at one point 2 were visible above the water....I texted my wife at

7:40
, so it was around there. Honestly it was too far away to tell if they were male, or I didn't really have enough, or a good scale to tell height. They didn't seem to be headed in any specific direction, or at least I couldn't tell if they were headed further any specific way. From the distance we were at we couldn't see fins in the water, just when they breached, and I saw them headed/facing both North and South at different times. -Tim Hunt

Tues

Entry 6:
19:35 -
We moved to Hastie Lake, whale was a little closer to that location but still far off shore
between Hastie and south end Swan Town
, milling back and forth. With some 4 minute down times and occasional 10 minute. 7 exhalations surface intervals. Left the whale heading directionally towards shore at
7:35

18:50 - From West Beach, Swan Town, West Whidbey
, Marilyn Armbruster spies the blows and body of a whale,
presumably gray
heading north. After ~ 10 minute down time whale surfaced again, 7 blows them a dive heading south. Fluke looked like that of a gray whale. S/he is approx 1/2-1 mile offshore between our location and Hastie Lake pullout, probably milling. -Alisa Lemire Brooks

Tues

Entry 7:
15:15 - There was a gray whale milling right off the Edmonds waterfront!
Not a Sounder and appears to be feeding back and forth with birds following. Very close to the breakwater

have turned back north and are milling/socializing. We can see at least 4 more gray whale blows in the distance on the Snohomish River delta.
