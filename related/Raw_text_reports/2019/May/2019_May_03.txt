Orca Sightings for May 3, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia -

15:39 -
I was just able to ID
L87 and Jpod
up this way today. They are currently foraging
south of the Little River Ferry terminal
in their usual Chinook spots. Maybe with the closure they are finding more? I wish them all good luck hunting today. -Nick Templeman

May 3 - There were more than 50 (!!) Bigg's/transient killer whales reported in the Salish Sea today! We encountered a group of 17 of them this afternoon in San Juan Channel, including 5 little ones less than 2 years old! This photo is of T49A1 and T123D. This afternoon we encountered the
T49As, T65Bs, T75Bs, T75Cs, and T123s just south of Friday Harbor in San Juan Channel. Between
1:30 and
2:30 PM
we followed them as they traveled north to Yellow Island...a memorable encounter with a group of 17 transients..., 5 of which were under 2 years old! So many fins!-Monika Wieland Shields
*
Well that's a trip for the record books! Outside of Friday Harbor we encountered not one, not two, but
five families of our Marine mammal-eating Bigg's killer whales
traveling together in a big tight group. Besides just the sheer number of them being so amazing to see each family also has a new calf under the age of two! It's no joke that the Bigg's are going through a baby boom with the ample supply of food here for them! Not to be outdone we saw some amazing eagle action on the trip as well.

Entry 3:

Jane Cogan called Dave at home in the
early afternoon
to relay a report of
a large group of transients heading northwest up San Juan Channel
. Dave grabbed his stuff and headed to Snug Harbor and left in the boat around 1440. "Orcinus" arrived on scene at 1505 about a mile and a half southwest of Jones Island. The
T49As, T65Bs, T75Bs, T75Cs, and the T123s were in a single tight group traveling slowly northwest
and appeared to be resting...Full report & image at Center for Whale Research Encounter 31.

Entry 5:
Hidden Beach.
On the water. I have not been keeping a number count of the
gray whales
who feed in front of our house - I guess I thought everyone else was. But we have had quite a few during the day that we can, and do, watch and enjoy. When the tide is out we can see all the holes the whales have dug to get to, or stir up, the ghost shrimp. Many mornings there are quite a number of new holes showing that the whales were in digging through the night. I take many pictures of the trails of holes to send kids and grandkids. However, that does not help you with a number count. Not sure how I can help you or if you would even like input - if you have specifics please let me know. -Diane Billingsley

Entry 6:
17:42 - At least one Gray appears to be feeding near the Country club on Camano
....Watching thru binoculars from the other side of Port Susan at Kayak Point. -Nate Trujillo
*

17:00 -
Hi, just wanted to report that I saw a whale "minke" I believe. It was
south of Livingston Bay, Port Susan
. I don't know if it was in trouble or not since the depth in that area can be 2-10 feet deep. This was around 5pm 5/4/19. -Zach Blakeslee (
sounds like a feeding
gray whale
- alb

Entry 7:
#22 Earhart
(by herself),
#49 Patch and #531
(together)
between Gedney and Everett.
Some interesting behavior from all three of them today! #22 was logging a LOT while they were around and seemed to keep watch of their movements when they came near. Then we found
#383 hanging out with #723 Lucyfer on the SW side of Gedney
. For the afternoon we had
#531 on the delta
as well as a few too far in for IDs and then
#723 joined along with #56!
A first for me seeing him this season. -Renee Beitzel
*

11:43 -
here is
two grays just north of the ferry lanes
. But interesting report...could be something else out here for sure! -Tyler McKeen
(
Those two grays were
#383 and #723
- Renee Beitzel
)
*
2 grays
were headed south at that time, no orcas out here and I've been at work on the ferry since 5am....I was about 1/2 mile from the grays, had a great view and I'm sure they weren't orcas. -Melissa Simmons, WSF
*

10:10 -
I am new to this area & live up the hill from Old Town
Mukilteo
I am seeing
2 large, black animals swimming near the ferry lane
between Muk & Whidbey. Unfortunately, my binoculars aren't strong enough (putting that on my shopping list!) so I couldn't see the detail. One of them breached which is what caught my eye and then I spotted 2 of them and watched for about 10 minutes. They were quite black, however. I was on a whale watching tour last weekend and saw several gray whales. These today seemed much blacker & smaller, but our home is at approximately 6th & Park in Mukilteo, so I wasn't close enough to get a good look. -Beth Lewis

13:15 - At least one grey whale right off Beach Camp, North Edmonds.
Feeding & diving. Right now. -Photos by Heather McRae Tabisola,

Entry 8:
Gray whale
was Northbound
just below the Narrows airport at about 7 pm
5/3. I did not see if he continued under the Narrows Bridge or not. A boat was chasing him and the boat continued North. I did get pictures from Day Island with a zoom lens....Not very clear but hopefully helpful. -Karen Caldwell
*

17:00 - Spotted a gray whale
, and got photos, from
Chambers Creek Park
(Chambers Bay Golf Course). We were on the pedestrian bridge over the train tracks and watched the whale progress from right to left, toward Ketron Island, then back toward us. This gray whales extremely damaged/injured fluke is revealed as s/he dives in southern Puget Sound. -Lisa Holliday

Entry 9:
09:25 - I just received a call from an islander (Anderson island) saying there was a humpback at the
Steilacoom dock at 9am
. No direction of travel. -Belen Bilgic Schneider
(
reported as humpback, a gray was confirmed in the area later - alb
)
*

07:00 - The ferry crew saw it on the
Steilacoom side at
7:00 am
also. Fun that it is hanging around. Of course, I was on the
7:30 am. Missed both! -Lane Sample
