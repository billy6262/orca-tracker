Entry 6:

A
single grey whale was feeding this morning, at about
6:40am, at Sandy Point Beach
. I watched for about 10 minutes before it began heading west slowly, towards Langley. This particular spot (about 1/4 mile west of the Point itself) seems to be favorite for the whales, as I is where I usually see them. It sits below the high bluff, just below Wateredge Drive. -Cheers. Jeff Rice
