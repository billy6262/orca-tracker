Biggs/transient killer whales, Grays and a Humpback!!
Broke the drought on seeing orca, the
T65As (family group o 6) were found near Smith Island, a gray by the Navy base on Whidbey, and a humpback (Scratchy) by Lawson Reef
. Also some good views of Tufted puffins, harbor porpoise, a California sea lion and Steller sea lions. And some fog. Thank you Puget Sound Express. -Jill Hein

Amazing day on the water! Started at Smith Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca near
Smith Island where we found a playful group of transient orcas, the T065A's! T65A2
and his unique fluke. Closer to Smith Island we then had a couple of Tufted Puffins pop up next to the boat! On to Whale Rocks at Cattle Pass where we saw a bunch of Steller Sea Lions, bald eagles, Brandt's Cormorants and gulls. We got to see a branded sea lion and a cute interaction with the smallest lion taking on the biggest! Next, we found
"Scratchy" the humpback whale
! He logged next to our boat for awhile, then we moved on towards Whidbey where we found
gray whale #2253
! On the way home we spotted a submarine in the distance!! Trifecta day for whales!! -Janine Harles

Entry 5:
three different species of whales
sighted within the first hour! The first sign of a good day to come was when the downpour of rain ceased just as we started boarding, and held off for the duration of our journey. Not twenty minutes after getting of the dock, we had eyes on our first whale of the day. It turned out to be little
2251, a newly named gray whale
that seems to be calling Burrow's Bay home. We spent some time with this little one as he circled the bay, showing off its fluke every now and again. This little one is clearly a fighter, as indicated by the past entanglement scars and orca rake marks on its fluke....Excerpt from Island Adventures
