Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES -
Alaska transients T128 (L) and younger brother T125A (R) swimming south in Haro Strait
after T128 made a kill (less than 5 minutes!). T128 spyhopping and showing off his trophy of intestines. If you zoom in on T128, you can see meat with dark skin in his mouth. -Photos by Ariel Yseth, Spirit or Orca,

Entry 2:

Jane Cogan called Dave in the early afternoon to relay a report that
T125A and T128 had been found near Beamont Shoal
. Since they weren't that far away, Dave grabbed his gear and headed for Snug Harbor and left in the boat at
1420
. "Orcinus" arrived on scene around 1445 about halfway between the Beaumont Shoal buoy and Seabird Point on Discovery Island...Full report & image at Center for Whale Research Encounter 32.

Entry 3:
17:22 - Grays at Deception Pass! There were 2
and right about here (map shows off West Beach at Deception Pass). I was pretty shocked to even get to see them! One came super close to shore momentarily! -Jami Cantrell

1500 -
We saw at least
3 whales from the beach at Joseph Whidbey State Park
. Not sure what kind because they were pretty far out. They seem to be heading west. No dorsal fins...There's a couple blows that you can see and they come up where you can see backs briefly. There were 3. Kinds far away though. -Tiffany Garey
(
video reviewed...presumed to be grays -alb

14:00 -
A quick trip to
Rocky Point (Oak Harbor) near Naval Air Station WI
around 2pm today proved to be a fruitful outing. There were at least two different whales hanging out. Thankfully, I remembered to snag my camera as I ran out the door...A bit about the behavior today, none of the whales ever dove deep enough to show their tail flukes. One appeared to be "spy hopping" which I sort of captured in one of the photos I sent you. Was one of the whales a different species? There is a photo of two whales and they look a bit different, to me...however, I am far from an expert. I know my frequent whale sightings are less than ideal and hate that I am seeing them under such circumstances. However, I have really enjoyed getting to watch them and today was quite the sight with the Olympics in the background...Thanks again for all you do! -Sincerely, Casie McClellan
