Terrible pictures but we left the

1 orca in Upright Channel and 6 others in Harney channel

5/1/2019 What a wonderful May Day it was! We encountered
Southern Resident Killer Whales in Rosario Strait
socializing and generally being playful. We realized quickly that it was
J Pod
when while we were watching the main group at a distance, three individuals approached us quite closely. They were
L87 Onyx, J37 Hy'Shqa and J49 T'ilem I'nges
. Shortly after passing us, they joined up with the rest of J Pod, and while I wasn't quick enough to capture photos, we witnessed cartwheels, spyhops, lobtails, and breaches! Later we found a
couple of Minke Whales near Anacortes
. -Justine Buckmaster, Puget Sound Express

07:58 - Orcas milling West side of Orcas Island
. Below Mt. Constitution. Presumably J pod. 10 or 12.

COASTAL KILLER WHALES - Wed

Entry 3:
08:37 -
Dawn Keller called to report
3-7 orcas off Yachats, OR
. They are on the bluff and observed the animals about 1/4 mile off shore and saw a lot of fins and spouts, slapping in the water, churning water, seals hugging the shoreline. Hunting? Pod was traveling northbound.
*
GRAY WHALES - Wed

Entry 4:
14:19 -
I believe there is
two grays possibly three off of West Beach Road (west side of Whidbey Island, west of Oak Harbor, near Swantown)
. Lots of spouts and breaches. I believe they are headed south. -Shannon Heuvel
*

14:29 -
We moved down to
West Beach Road
now. On Whidbey side. At least half a mile out. Don't need binoculars to see. My sister in law Shannon messaged you too.

13:32 -
We are at
Rocky Point Beach (West Whidbey)
and there are spouts, more than likely grays. Thought I would let you guys know. -Alishia Mountcastle
*
Yesterday (
May 1), I was out at
Rocky Point which is just down the beach from Moran SP
and watched
one, maybe two, gray whales
. They seemed to be swimming close to the surface as I only saw blows and the occasional dorsal fin. They or It was moving north toward Moran in about 20-30 minutes. Unfortunately, I did not have my camera but they never dove deep enough for a tail fluke. I hear they are out there again this morning and hope I make it out there in time with camera in hand to snap some more photos for you guys. Thanks for all you do for the whales!! -Sincerely, Casie McClellan
*

12:53 - one whale
. Lots of birds, maybe feeding? Staying in a small area, surfacing every few min. (video confirms gray - alb) One blowhole sighting, same place (
off Moran Beach, West Whidbey
)

11:08 -
presumably more grays!...Little guy came up once and didn't come back up, so I assume he/she is moving through. (off
Moran Beach, West Whidbey
). -Stephanie Salem
*

1:20 -
Popped up
100 yards off Coupeville ferry
on right side, safe! Phew.

1:18 -
And yep he's crossing ferry lane now and ferry heading out.... Did a big surface right before departure so hopefully captain saw that.

1:15 -
I walked over and let ferry know... Current path of travel puts him right in the ferry lane about departure time.

12:55 -
Slow westbound travel towards ferry.

12:53 -
And now he just popped up right in front of me of course.

12:30 - saw a breath, not a sign of anything since
. Drove to the beach 1.5 miles west of where I last saw whale, haven't seen anything.
1228 -
whale stopped feeding and started traveling west close to shore,

11:28 -
(Alisa asked if whale looking still near death) Probably not. I know feeding behaviour and when I first got here, super close to shore, not moving, not feeding, and saw the fins and how thin. Shortly after he resumed feeding and has just been seemingly doing that. I could've caught him in a nap, or break or something?

10:23 -
Oh he's so skinny He's practically on the beach. He could be dying. He's trying to feed in the shallows but very slow moving. Part of his pec is injured but healed, not sure if orca bites or what So he's still currently slowly swimming in shallows but he doesn't look good. He's small too, maybe a juvenile. -Rachel Haight
Wed

Entry 5:
Admiralty Bay
- Alie Perez, Cascadia Research: "Took the best right through the catalog and didn't find a match".
(For a brief time it was thought this whale might be near death, all stranding coordinators were put on alert. The emaciated whale with severe pec fin injuries eventually left the bay and swam towards deeper waters of Admiralty Inlet, s/he could not be relocated after swimming off. - ALB
)
*

10:06 -
Looks like he is definitely headed south now...but taking his time rolling I front of the houses, lol!

09:45 -
do you watch other whales? I think there is
a gray
just off the coast of
Whidbey by Keystone ferry
....South of keystone ferry, in front of the development, rolling in the shallows. (photos below) Jennifer Holmes
*

08:55 -
Kat called to relay report from Marcus Raymond who observed
a gray whale close to the Coupeville ferry
. The whale was heading out towards the channel more directionally northbound.
*

Entry 6:
18:20 - It's a gray
. It had gone south
into Eld
. I saw it coming north out of Eld. It headed east and is currently heading south
into Budd
. Deep dives. Saw it surface 6 times now. Just heard "woo hoos" from some house near the top of Cooper Point on the western shore. I have contacted Jessie.

18:05 -
Scott says he saw a whale's blow out front of
Boston Harbor
. 10 feet high. Only one surface/back. I'm looking and haven't seen it. Super choppy. It headed north out of Eld. Then went east across Cooper Point spit, hung a south into Budd for a few surfaces and then headed north toward Dana Passage. -Kim Merriman

MINKE WHALES - Mon

Entry 7:
two minkes here just south of the ferry lanes (off Anacortes)
. Whether or not they're the same ones is up for debate. Seen at

12:00 pm
from the Saratoga. -Justine Buckmaster

08:06 -
Mike at WSF Operations called to relay a report of
2 whales (reported as minke) breaching off Shannon Point, Anacortes
