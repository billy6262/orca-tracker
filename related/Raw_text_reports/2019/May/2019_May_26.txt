Whale

Entry 8:
Moran Beach on Whidbey Island
and spotted this
whale
. The heat distortion was horrible on the water and the whale was a bit out there but heres a couple shots I managed to get. Again heavily cropped. I first spotted it around 1pm heading towards deception pass area but when I swung back through at

7:30 pm
it was making its was towards the navy base. Resident there stated they see them all the time out there feeding. Saw some blows but mostly fins up out of the water, like it was rolling around. Not a whale but there was also 1 sea lion just floating around out there too. Anyways hopefully these blurry shots will help with identifying who this was. Thanks for all your updates on your facebook page, I hope one day I'll be in the right place to see those Orcas. -Jamie Bartram

Entry 9:
Reported as grays, photos show
humpback
. Possible a gray was in the area as well - alb
) I saw at least one, maybe two, gray whales at about

19:30
on Sunday 26
May 2019 in
Henderson Bay, just south of Minter Creek
....The gray whale(s) appeared to be feeding and first headed north, then turned and headed south, out of the bay. My best view came when looking through binoculars - that's when I identified one - I got a clear view of its spout, head, and back, and then it sounded, giving me a clear view of its flukes. My first view on Sunday night was with my naked eye and at several hundred meters. So, that photo is a humpback? I wondered, given that I could see something that looked like small dorsal fin but I thought that it was just one of the bumps on the back of a gray whale and the poor focus. So, maybe I did see some surface feeding before that...Thanks! Tim Hoffinagle
