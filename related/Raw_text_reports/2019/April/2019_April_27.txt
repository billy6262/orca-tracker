Orca Sightings for April 27, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Penn Cove
- Guests on Saturday's Anacortes tour spotted
a gray whale
we have never seen before
in the Salish Sea
. After a bit of digging, we found out that this whale does not yet have an official ID number, but
was photographed in San Francisco Bay on
March 16th.
There are an estimated 25,000 gray whales along the west coast, so making this match is truly extraordinary! Thanks to Cascadia Research Collective and San Francisco Whale Tours for helping to make this connection! -Erin, Island Adventures
