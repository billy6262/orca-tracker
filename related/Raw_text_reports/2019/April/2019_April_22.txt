Orca Sightings for April 22, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
18:00 - Orcas spotted off Point Hudson
- My family and I spotted a pod with at least one male and a baby off Point Hudson heading North.
I think there were 5.
It looked like there were 3 swimming together and a mother and calf a little behind them. -Thanks, Sara Bailly

16:17 - Orcas
, mid channel
between North Beach and west San Juan Island
. Female headed west, male headed east (for that moment). Very calm seas....directionally, it's more like between PT and Victoria. Before I could get the binocs to my eyes, I could see that it was too large. So,
just those two fins, male and female, very close together, moving in opposite directions
. Curious, lots of seal activity noticeable since then (they would have caught my eye, too) just off shore. I've been concerned that there's been relatively scant sight of them these last years, compared to when we moved here in '05. Is it mating season on Protection Island? - Hope the hydrophones caught the orcas. -Annette Huenke

GRAY WHALES - Mon Apr 22 - Juan de Fuca - Good morning! I wanted to report a sighting of what I believe was
two grey whales off the coast of NAS Whidbey Island
this morning! I was driving in the northern gate at about

7:45am
and happened to see the blowhole mist not too far off the shore, approximate lat/long 4822N 12240W. I pulled over and was able to grab my binoculars and watch what I think was two whales slowly traveling south and blowing every 30-45 seconds. They stayed really low in the water and I never saw a fluke or the heads, but I could see the backs, which were dark colored and bumpy with white spots that I assume were barnacles. I watched for about 15 minutes and then came back out at around
8:20am to a location slightly further south and were able to find them and watch them again for another 15 minutes, approximate location 4820N 12241W. We are assessing that they were 400-700 yards off shore. They seemed to be moving slightly further off shore and continuing south. I hope this is helpful! -Stephanie Garza

buoy between

We are watching a baleen

My friend Laura Fridinger reported
a gray whale located near Moran Beach
on 4/22. Here are the photos I took. I apologize for the quality but it was a nasty, rainy day which exacerbates the graininess...Photos by Casie McClellan, Apr 22, 2019
