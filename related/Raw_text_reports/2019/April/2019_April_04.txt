Orca Sightings for April 4, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Biggs killer whales in the Gulf Islands
. We spent time with two matrilines known as the
T018s and the T049As
. LOTS of socializing and surface active behaviour! On our way home from the whales, we found another family of Biggs! The
T123s
with their little one (under a year old), T123D was a bonus on an, already, fantastic day. -Ocean EcoVentures WW
*
T049A5
came rushing back to the group after being separated on it's own for a bit. Once joining back up, mom seemed either excited? Or reprimanding the little one for taking off and being too far away. Shot is a bit soft but a really interesting moment today with the
T049As and T018s

Entry 2:
17:25 - Orcas exited Port Susan
a bit ago and are hugging the shoreline on the mainland side, currently north of Tulalip Bay heading southeast, keeping to Tulalip. (they continued passing Tulalip Bay short time later still hugging shore). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Hi Susan or other Orcanetwork person - A note from Camano Island. I was delivering a telescope to a friend yesterday at about
2:00pm and found them on their deck watching Orcas along the west side of
Port Susan Bay
in the Country Club area. More specifically in the Crestview Drive area between Crest Place and S. Fairway Drive. He reported seeing a total of 7 Orcas including a "smaller one". I think they must have been visible for an hour or so. Apparently about half the group headed south while three remained in the area for awhile. A small boat was seen following the whales. That's about all I can tell you. I wonder if these were Biggs or Residents? -John Custer

13:57 -
Amazing encounter with
appx 12 orca hunting porpoise close to shore
along Beach Drive, Camano, just south of Cavelero,
Port Susan
. Every behavior on display: slow patrols, tail slaps, spyhops, breaches, lunging/surfing. They've moved to mid channel and are now heading south. Lots of pictures. Will post when I get home. -Krista Paulino
*

1:30 -
Glacier Spirit left them slowly northbound in
Port Susan. T86s
close to Camano shore and T124s parallel to them mid channel. Today was another beautiful one on the Glacier Spirit. Even before we left the dock, we were able to see the blows of two Gray Whales heading toward us and once we got underway, we identified them as
#53 Little Patch and #383
moving slowly north up Saratoga Passage. We then made our way into Port Susan to view two families of
Transient Killer Whales, the T86As and the T124As
. Both pods were travelling stealthily at a leisurely pace, likely looking for prey. As we rounded Camano Head on our way back to Langley, we stumbled upon
Gray Whales #21 Shackleton and #22 Earhart!

Orca Sighting in
Port Susan. A pod of Orcas
were in Port Susan bay off the east shore of Camano Island last Thursday afternoon. There were at least 7 or 8 whales incuding a couple of small calfs. They stayed around for about two hours, including breaching several times before heading south out of the bay. I do have a video as well. -T. Jenkins

Entry 3:
4:40 p.m. ... I headed up the
Ebey's Landing / Ebey's Bluff Trail
. When I got some "altitude" on the trail... I noticed a couple watching ''something'' in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. I stopped & asked them what they were watching.... they replied... "
A BIG Gray
... who we've seen blow- twice!" Sooo...I decided to stay & see what I can see ! Within the next 15 - 20 minutes I was lucky / blessed to be able to watch that Gray - blow about ( 6 ) times ...and semi-breach... as it made its way South. Twaz a thrill! (thought there was no dorsal, just a smooth back). -Wayne Flaaten

Entry 7:
a humpback breach in the Strait of Juan de Fuca 2/3 of the way to Port Angeles
