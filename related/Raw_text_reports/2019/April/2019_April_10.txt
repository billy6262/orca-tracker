Orcas Island in the Presidents Channel between Waldron Island and Orcas

Entry 2:
1 or 2 male orcas NB at the north end of Colvos at
7:30 PM

April 10...Very certain on species and sex. Less on number - saw two fins in rapid succession, but not at the surface simultaneously, so it may have been just a single animal. About 50 m from shore. -Shannon Kachel

Entry 3:

08:20 -
Fairly certain I saw
a lone baleen whale off Alki Beach
...Really close to shore. Maybe 100 yards out? Traveling north. Looks like maybe the fast ferry from Bremerton got a report because it was moving pretty slow. -Stephen Cohen
