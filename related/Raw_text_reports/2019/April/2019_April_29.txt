Entry 3:
a gray whale just north of Wildcat Cove at Larrabee State Park
. Friends report it yesterday (28th) in the south end of Chuckanut Bay...with really good pics and videos. -Keith Kemplin

Entry 4:
15:15 - At Rocky Point
- I saw a spout again so I assume it's the same whale that was there the previous day. It seems to be staying at that general area
off of West Beach
. I think there was another one because at one point I saw another spout not long after another. They must have been perhaps 8 feet away. I have been staying a couple hours watching the whale and it didnt really look like it was heading a certain direction. -Karina Mitchell

headed west. Close to shore! -Diane Steigleder

Entry 7:
Gray Whale #531
took our breath away with her need for speed! I have rarely seen Gray Whales going over 5 mph and
she was going over 6 mph
! She made and impressive wave as she lifted both her head and flukes high on each surfacing, except on those where she remained at the surface, breathing as she continued to swim quickly with her head above the waves. I called it speed logging. Though I wasn't quick enough to catch a photo, she also breached once when we first arrived on scene. This was also the first day this season I saw Tufted Puffins out near Smith Island! -Justine Buckmaster
