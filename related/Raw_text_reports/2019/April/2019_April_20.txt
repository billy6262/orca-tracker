Entry 2:
Deception pas
s, sharp eyed captain Scott spotted another whale for us. This time it was a
humpback whale in Rosario Strait
and we landed some really great looks. It turned out to be
"Apollo"
, daughter of BCY0172!!! She had been sighted in Hawaii in 2018 so it was really crazy to see how far she has come. After many great views of Apollo we had to wave goodbye. Our search continued around Cyprus Island and returned to Anacortes having completed an amazing journey!!! "Another humpback has returned to the Salish Sea for the season! "Apollo", the 2010 calf of BCY0172 "Horizon", was spotted heading north in Rosario Strait on Saturday,
April 20th. Last year Apollo welcomed a calf of her own, a male nicknamed "Nova" - three generations! Apollo tends to spend time a bit more to the north and may just be passing through, but a great sighting nonetheless!" -Tyson - Full report & images at Island Adventures Blog Apr 20.

Entry 3:
Larrabee SP - ~

17:00 -
Enjoying the beautiful day at Clayton beach when we noticed a spray of water, then the roll of a surfacing back then a glimpse of a
whale
tale, it was small. It seem the size of an orca but I believe it was alone. We watched for about 10 minutes. We would see the spray and the surface and then it would be gone for a few minutes. It headed north towards bellingham Bay. Very close to shore but not close enough for me to see marking and confirm
it was an orca
. Just going by size and tail. (48.6425680, -122.4896692) Around 5pm 4/20/19. -Danielle Morgan

The whale was back/resighted at
3PM
today -
Gray whale just outside Wildcat Cove
, which is the boat launch area on the
north end of Larrabee SP
. It was about 200 yards out from my vanatage point at a private residence above the cove. -Joe Meche

14:46 - Grey whale feeding off Larrabee State Park
! -Vanessa Morse
*
...All I had was my phone. I got two videos, one that I hoped showed the knuckles - might be able to pull a still from that. The same
whale
was there Friday. I think it was a younger animal, it seemed small...He or she looked short, if that's a term that can describe a whale. It's why I thought it might be a HB until I watched it awhile and saw it up close and saw the heart shaped blows multiple times. Watched it for ~ 3 hours as it cruised up and down, feeding with about 2-3 minute dives. -Andrea Vance

Approx location
Clayton Beach

13:18 - Gray whale sighted in Wildcat cove at Larrabee

North of Freshwater Bay

Entry 5:
18:03 - Deception Pass, Grey whale
right now, close to shore by
Cranberry Lake
...in the end we counted 3 greys, they took their time getting down to the star and that's where it looked like they started to feed.....I know there were other people on the beach with really nice cameras and long lenses but I don't know if they're on here. There was a definite third trailing just behind these two. Map image courtesy of Sofia Cardozo, Apr 20, 2019

Entry 6:
17:40-
19:30 We saw four gray whales
including a small one...right off seaplane base. (
Crescent Harbor

Entry 7:
*
...Just outside of
Crescent Harbor
Captain Scott found our first whale of the day. It was
gray whale 56
and he was being his usual self with longer dives than most of our Sounders. After a few surfacings from him we headed into Crescent harbor and picked up three more gray whales. The first is a whale brand new to this area, not one of our "Sounder" population, and has been given the number
CRC-2249
. After some close passes we headed further in to the bay to check out a couple other whales. These two were identified as
723 "Lucy" and CRC-185
and they were feeding like crazy. Pec fins and tail flukes were going mad churning up white water all around as these two giants fed heavy in the shallows...Full report and photos at Island Adventures Blog Post

Entry 11:
18:37 -
We are visiting
La Push
from our home in Puget Sound, and have been delighted today to see a
pod of whales feeding right off of First Beach
in front of the Quileute Oceanside Resort today, starting about 4 pm and still going strong. Of course, we neglected to bring our binoculars. They definitely are not orcas, and we have not seen any dorsal fins at all. So our
guess is gray whales
. We estimate
at least 5
, possibly as many as 8. So many blows, and occasional spy hopping. Sadly, this is the best photo I could catch. It has been a true delight to watch them! I would estimate, based on some relatively small "blows" scattered among them, that there are some juveniles. -Tari Poe Norris
