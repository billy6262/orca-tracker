Hi Alisa! (Observed and photographed from shore)
Haro Strait SJI, S/SE of Edwards Pt.
All bunched up and moving fast, I observed
4-5 orca (one large male) traveling to the S/SE
. As they hurried past one took time to perform a rolling maneuver that I hope was prey related.

three to four, including a Big male, female maybe 2 younger?
Bit of feeding activity but down now. As of
13:30 they are Kitsap side and approaching Eglon. Here are pics for hopeful ID's. They were close to the Kitsap side, not midchannel. They were about at the edge of the shipping lane. Trending north at a leisurely pace, occasional feeding activity. -Sara Frey (

Entry 4:
gray whale #531
, who was feeding along and CLOSE to the shores of
Gedney Island
. Even as close as looks, she was still in about 100 feet of water! Later on, we got a few glimpses of
#53
LP, who surprised us with a spyhop!! To be fair,
#531
did it once too, but I was not fast enough to get a photo...
#49 Patch
was out there too but he was further off and being antisocial. -Renee Beitzel

Entry 5:
a humpback whale
from my back deck this morning on
West Beach in Oak Harbor
, Washington....I saw it initially out of the corner of my eye diving down. I watched for ten to fifteen minutes after that and was able to see the blowhole a couple of times but then had to get back to work. I will be sure to let you know if I see it again or if I'm able to view more of it's activity. -Linda Votaw
(
Attached video - too distant to confirm humpback or gray, but
gray more likely
based on beahvior, proximity to shore, and previous sightings in the area - al

Delayed report of a
humpback between Coleman Dock and Ivar's on the Seattle Waterfront
