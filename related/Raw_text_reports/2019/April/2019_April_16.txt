Orca Sightings for April 16, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Active Pass
- An intriguing and special time with orcas around

7:30 pm
on Tuesday,
April 16th on the
shore of Galiano Island
on Active Pass. A couple of sea lions swam quickly through the pass from the east. Shortly after that,
a group of 4 orca came through
from the same direction. Identified as the
T049a's
by Rachelle Hayden. Definitely in moving in stealth mode. They went almost to the west end of the Pass and then turned around. Much more activity -- tail slaps, a cartwheel, a series of breaches by the male. Came close to the shore and had a good look for fish right in front of me. They continued east and went around Mary Ann Point just after 8 pm.

Out of the two eco-types of Killer Whales that we see regularly in the Salish Sea, mammal-feeding Bigg's Killer Whales are the lucky ones. Unlike the Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, which feed primarily on declining runs of Chinook Salmon, Bigg's Killer Whales have an ample food supply, hunting Harbor Seals, porpoise, and Sea lions. Mammal-feeding Bigg's Killer whales are thriving in the Salish Sea. With about 300 individuals that can be seen in the area, we are encountering more and more family groups on a regular basis. In fact, we have seen mammal-feeding Killer Whales almost everyday since the beginning of March. It's been fascinating to see a boom of Bigg's Killer Whale calves being born and surviving. This highlights how critical the issue of food is in survival rates. Today was an incredible reminder of what is possible when the top ocean predator has ample food. The
T123's
are a group of 4 individuals. Mom and her 4 kiddos, the most recent,
T123D
, is under a year old. Today we saw the family hunt, and the wee little one got to expend some built up energy and practice belly flops. It was absolutely amazing! We lost track of just how many belly flops and breaches T123D did today. Luckily we have some video! Check it out! How many breaches/belly flops did you count? -Western Prince, Video by Traci Walter & Ivan Reiff, Apr 16, 2019

I finally got to ring the whale bell at the
Coupeville Wharf
today, as
gray whale #2249
made a close pass by, heading east towards the boat launch. This whale (sex unknown) had been traveling back and forth in Penn Cove all morning, appeared to be stalled (feeding?) between the wharf and boat launch when I left, close to noon. Unfortunately, no fluke (tail) shots. (Zoomed and cropped.) -Jill Hein

08:00 - Two, possibly three, grey whales off Sandy Point Beach
this morning just before 8am, heading slowly up Saratoga Passage, towards Langley. Lots of spouting! We sit back from the bluff about 1/4 mile, so sometimes difficult to get a good look and count. -Jeff Rice

07:09 -
Spotted whale off of the
north side of the Clinton to mukilteo 7am ferry
. Unfortunately I didn't see any others with it so not sure what type. It breached the surface twice. It was headed towards Saratoga Passage. Seemed larger... So I'm wondering if it was a gray. -Kristen Wagner-Patterson
