I was alerted by friend

10:30 am who saw 2 grays feeding between Fox Spit and Bells Beach
, too far to photo for IDs. They traveled towards Bells Beach and then headed out toward mid channel trending southeast I'd say around 11am. Folks in Langley and across at Camano keep an eye out. -Marilyn Armbruster
