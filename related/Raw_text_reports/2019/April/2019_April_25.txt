Orca Sightings for April 25, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia
- It was a bit rough but we were rewarded by seeing 8 Biggs killer whales. The
T090s, T124A2's and T087
pushing into the waves heading north. The Bonapartes gulls are still abundant in Active Pass feeding in huge aggregations too!
T90 and T90B.
Great day in the Salish Sea with the
T124A2s, T090s and T087
. It was fun to watch T087 punch through the waves with his smushed rostrum peeking above the them. Photos by Gary Sutton, Apr 25, 2019 Ocean EcoVentures WW

Gray Whale tours
on Saratoga. Don't worry, they haven't left yet, so we'll likely still see gray whales on some of our half day tours which start tomorrow! We were treated to encounters with 5 individual Gray Whales, including

I spotted a
humpback whale just north of Sydney Island, Humpback Dalmation
, towards Stuart Island in the Salish Sea. I have attached a few photos, the whale was doing some good 10-20 min dives, but not a ton of tail showing. -Thanks so much! Amanda Glasel

The day started off with us finding a
humpback whale BCY0169 - 2015 calf known as Dalmation
" only 30 minutes from Cowichen Bay! This is a welcomed sight and this is one of the first humpbacks to be spotted in the Salish Sea after their winter in the breeding grounds ... (see photo by Capt Gary below). -Ocean EcoVentures WW
