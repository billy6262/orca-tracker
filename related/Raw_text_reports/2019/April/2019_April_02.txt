Peek-a-boo! My favorite behavior = SPYHOPPING!! This is one of the
T124A or T86A
ladies They were spyhopping a lot after they made a kill today and whatever it was, it was large! There was a huge oil slick and that sweet (?) smell of cucumber wafting through the air as we were down wind. I almost missed this opportunity as there were whales everywhere we looked at one point and I didn't know where to point my camera, lol. -Renee Beitzel
