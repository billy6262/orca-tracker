While I was kayaking at Kluxewe resort (
9 km north of Port McNeil, BC on the northern end of Vancouver Island

Yesterday (9th) at around

3:50 P.M
. I saw what I now believe to be
a minke whale in Dalco Passage off Owen Beach
. I only saw it surface twice and the second time it surfaced I managed to catch this picture before it disappeared. It was headed northwest just 100 yards off shore. I wasn't sure what it was at first as it was too large to be a porpoise and the dorsal fin didn't seem to fit with anything I had seen before. While this picture does make it seem small, I think that's just because most of the whale was underwater at the time I took this picture. -Connor O'Brien

Entry 10:
09:06 - Hearing some big breaths near Landbank
