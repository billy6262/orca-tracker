Entry 3:

15:00 - Orca sighting today Henderson Bay
. First picture was taken today around
3:00 pm Henderson Bay in shallow water below my neighbors house by the time I got to my camera. They were heading toward Purdy Spit. I saw only two at the time. A bit later the four were seen out in the middle of Henderson Bay and seemed to be hunting. Can you tell me if they are the same ones? These are the best picture I could take and zoomed in.
I think the four were hunting
and got something. I have a fuzzy picture of a smaller one spy hopping. -Terry Shovlowsky

They just turned and headed back north-ish toward the
east end of McNeil
, after an epic feeding just offshore of the prison....We left the area at

11:30 - they
changed direction a dozen times
while we were there for about an hour...And yes, definitely eating seals. Threw one in the air a couple of times.

10:35 - Orca.
Found them! On the move and on the hunt. The arrow is their general direction of travel. -Mia Bosetti (

08:35 -
Father's Day Morning,
Carr Inlet
- just outside of Home. Pretty sure boat in picture startled them. Pod was in 2 groups around us, we had no idea they were there. Headed out of sight around Fox Island towards Tacoma. -Kaitlyn Hermsen

Entry 5:
Moresby Island and we joined up with T77A
. When we got on scene it seemed as though he was playing with a prawn pot or at least the small buoy to mark the pots location. The buoy would disappear almost every time the whale dove and for a while concerns came out that he might be entangled. A call had been made long before we arrived and a trained team was on scene to assess the situation. As they moved in to investigate T77A did a huge tail throw and it became clear he was definitely free of the prawn pot. He the celebrated a bit with a breach and a lot of tail slaps. It was clear that he was a very happy whale and very proud of himself. We waved goodbye to T77A "Saulitis" (named for researcher Eva Saulitis)...Island Adventures (Jun 16 day report link in humpback section)

Entry 6:
T49Bs
! We had Transient Orcas in

Entry 7:
13:15 - Looks like 2 humpbacks off S Pender Island
just east of Bedwell Harbor. -Mari Blakeslee Hauser
*
Sun Jun 16 - Juan de Fuca Strait...After the wildlife bonanza of Race Rocks, we made our turn back to the south and came across an active but elusive
humpback whale, known as MMZ0041, a little closer to Port Angeles
. This whale "cartwheeled" more than once and raised his/her flukes a few times too, which gave us a chance to identify it! After getting a few great looks at MMZ0041, we headed back to the dock and it was just in time as the wind began to pick up...Island Adventures
