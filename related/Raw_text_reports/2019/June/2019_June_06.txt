Hello,

12:35 - Watching orca T137s and others, about 5...supposedly T65Bs too!
These pictures were taken today off of
Burrows Island/Washington Park today around
12:40pm
while out with Capt. Drew on Outer Island Excursions. I believe it's T137A and family. We also saw them off the South Western tip of Lopez Island about 3pm. Have a great evening. (
