On Saratoga was a nice day spent in Puget Sound. Not far from our port of Edmonds, we encountered two
Transient Killer Whale families, the T36s and the T99s.
They were difficult to keep up with but it was hard to miss the celebration after they successfully made and shared a kill! Later, we stumbled upon a
Humpback Whale in Possession Sound
which happened to be none other than
"Two Spot"
! -Justine Buckmaster
*
The
Orca
appeared to be heading back to the north from
Jefferson Head around 11 am
. These Orca swam through and around 50 or more boats fishing the area. We were done fishing when we noticed and pulled up the gear to watch. The observation I have is that fishing fleets aren't actively following or looking to see them, but always welcome. -Matt McCulloch
*

11:09 - Orcas
seem to be hunting now and holding steady at the tip of
Jefferson's point
.
1

0:35 - Orcas off Jefferson Point heading south.

It was the
humpback

16:53 -
Orca Network, seeing some activity from the Mukilteo sailing to
Clinton @
4:45.
I do not have my binoculars so it's very hard to tell if whales but seem to be by Glendale. I'm going to go check it out after I get off the ferry. Again I do not have my binoculars so I am not sure. (
Humpback

San Juan Clipper just saw 1
whale headed NE in Skagit Bay near Strawberry Pt.
We didn't get an ID on it. It was definitely a gray whale. I got a good view of its dorsal ridge. It seemed to be swimming normally. -Lauren Ryan Booth
*
Gray's
were feeding out front just before daybreak yesterday. Warm enough to have the windows open and the sound of the "spouts" woke me up. We're about
700-800 feet north of Hidden Beach
. I had to leave before low tide to take pictures of the feeding holes and didn't get home until dark but I'll try today. An encouraging sound though. -Diane Billingsley
*

Entry 10:
between Hat Is and Port of Everett ~
12:20
, he observed
a gray whale
(very light, w/very barnacled head) who looks to be having very hard time, who is acting very lethargic, slow swimming and erratically. Sean is familiar with grays and feeding, was not that. No entanglement.
Whale ran into channel piling/ marker off SE Hat Island
, piling shook.
*

Entry 11:
departed Mukilteo at 11 am
on Friday

Entry 12:
11:15, an announcement came over the PA system that whales were nearby. I saw a black whale surface about one quarter mile south of the Clinton ferry dock. It did not have a prominent dorsal fin thus I do not think it was an orca. Therefore I
think it was a minke
whale. It was too dark to be a gray whale. The whale appeared to be traveling south. Although the PA announcement used the plural ("whales") I saw only one....I mentioned minke only because I ruled out orca or gray. At the time it did not occur to me a humpback was an option. It could have been a humpback. -Regards, Peter Oakley, Langley WA
