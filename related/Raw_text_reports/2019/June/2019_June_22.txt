Humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" southbound Possession Sound
seen from
Brighton Beach, Glendale Beach and Possession Beach Boat Launch
6/22/2019. First reported by Justine to Orca Network, from The Saratoga Whale Watching boat (Puget Sound Express) seen at Sandy Point (Langley) around

10:30 am
. ID'd and confirmed by Alisa - Orca Network.
I headed to Brighton Beach and he was not far out from shore, mid Brighton ...no boats around at that time. He went down for at least 5+ minutes and popped back up just at about the ferry lanes, closer to Whidbey side. I headed to Glendale Beach and he came back up just north of there and went under for about another 1/2-3/4 mile or so before coming back up again south of Glendale. this is when another whale watching boat showed up. I then headed to Possession Beach Park Boat Launch and again, he didn't come back up until he was a tad south of the launch. You could tell the WW boat was losing track of him, at that point Two Spot popped up not far from the boat. He continued south nearing Possession Point State Park which is the most southeastern tip of Whidbey Island. It was a treat for me to see Two Spot, whale blessed. -Marilyn Armbruster

June 22 & 23 - Phone call this morning w/ Brooke Finley who left message regarding whale sightings including unusual behaviors off their home this past weekend. She is
uncertain if humpback or gray
. They live
between Blaine and Birch Bay
, between Semiahmoo Spit and Birch Point.
Saturday 22nd they observed large whale close in going south very slowly, exhalations noted.
Sunday 23rd similar looking whale just off their home in shallow water, wasn't moving and just hung out for long time in same area, was not traveling (or feeding, which I descried to her). Amount of exhalation way less than Saturday. They have not seen the whale since Sunday.
