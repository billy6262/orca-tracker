Entry 2:

I went to
Washington Park in Anacortes, WA
. And almost immediately after my arrival heard the telltale exhalation of a whale and to my surprise
a Minke Whale
surfaced just 10-20ft off shore. I had to scrambled to get my camera out, but luckily I was able to snap a single photo. Happy whale sightings, -Britt (Brittan Noelle Philbin)

Correction to my post of gray whale at
5:45 in Deceptions Pass. It was actually a humpback whale. Ran back to get binoculars and confirmed. He went from naval base to infront of Deception pass and back towards naval base.......many people said it was a humpback as well last night. We did see a dorsal fin down his back with our binoculars. We were wondering if there were two out there as well.

17:45 - Watching two gray whales from Deception Pass Beach
looking towards naval base! -Deanna Hunter
(
Confirmed gray whale per Marilyn's photos above. No images of humpback being reported - alb

16:56 -
Appears to be one or two orcas headed north, mid-channel Saratoga Passage. Just north of
Cama Beach
. Not 100% (on species) It, or they, didn't show a lot of surface, but we thought we saw a white patch. Just bare-eyed it. -Nancy Culp Zaretzke
(
we had not other reports of orcas but we did have humpback and gray reports -alb
)
*
We have seen multiple whales today, baleen, off
Hidden Beach
, I do not think it was orcas (other report). First baleen heading south around
1300-1400
, next two milling off Hidden Beach around 1730, we didn't see any dorsal fins, which makes us believe it was a baleen pair, although we did not have binoculars, still love our whales. -Joan Smith

Mike w/WS Ferries Ops just called to report a
whale species unidentified (not orca) off the Rief Point Junction Bouy
which is south of Cypress Island on the ferry route to Anacortes. No direction of travel noted.

We had no other orca reports. Included in our last report confirmed humpback, but we leave open possibility orcas snuck through -alb
