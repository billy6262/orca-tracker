Orca Sightings for June 20, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
08:08 - Small whale sighting in Eld Inlet
. Black in color, did not see a dorsal fin...it was hard to tell about length but I would say 15 feet. We live at 2xxx Madrona Beach Rd, which is at the southern part of Eld Inlet. He was swimming very slowly. ... at first I thought it was a seal it had its nose out of the water. I told my husband that looks like a big seal, but as it was moving it slowly came to the top of the water and never came up far enough to see if it had a dorsel, but you could see the length of it...It might have been a Hugh sea lion. I thought it could be a baby whale with all the death with the big whales. Thought I should be telling someone. Thanks for your response, -Brenda Chase

. He's been in the headlines throughout the region due to his unique light coloration. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institue
