Orca Sightings for June 30, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
newest member of the T37A pod
! Presumably this is
T37A5
as he/she has been swimming right next to T37A most of the time. We saw this family
near Victoria, BC
. This calf was first spotted off Eureka, CA on
May 30 and it still had fetal folds at that time, so that means its really young. The transient killer whales are doing very well right now with lots of new calves born and plenty of marine mammals to eat in the Salish Sea. -Naturalist/Photographer, Bart Rulon, Puget Sound Express

It was a very interesting day here today in the Salish Sea on my full day trip and a real representation of what is happening here. On a day where the southern residents set a record for their absence from this area, we encountered
3 different groups of Bigg's killer whales
with each group having a very young calf with them. This population of mammal eating killer whales continues to thrive here due to an abundance of food unlike their fish eating cousins. Today, I was able to meet this little one for the first time.
