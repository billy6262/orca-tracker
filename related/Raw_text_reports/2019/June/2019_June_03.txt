Linda Thompson lives on the bluff

16:45. They then walked down part way and could see a
gray whale
swimming and engaged in what appeared to be typical feeding behavior (moving along with pec and fluke fins exposed). The whale moved on.

HUMPBACK WHALES - Mon Jun 3 - Anacortes: We started off the dock with a slight breeze and reports of some possible whales way up North! As we made our way through Guemes Channel we decided to turn North and go up through Bellingham Channel. It turns out we made the right call because not too long after we turned a
humpback whale was found off of Saturna Island

Entry 3:
Small whale
sighted. Yesterday afternoon (3rd) , maybe
3 to 4 pm. Dumas Bay area in Federal Way
. It wasn't huge, as best as I could tell (seen from a distance and height) perhaps the length of a car or van. Swimming beneath the surface, back surfaced briefly, and appeared to be alone, and fairly close to shore which is why I'm worried about her. Or him. Did not look like an orca, and we got a clear look at the tail for a moment, and Yep, by god, that is definitely a whale. I don't know what else to report, as I am not an experienced judge of distance or size. -Thanks, Amy Tucker
