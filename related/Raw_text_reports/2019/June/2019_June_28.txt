*
Fri

Entry 2:
21:23 - Group of at least 10 orcas travelling north past Point Roberts
- breaching tail lobbing playing - could these be our missing Southern Residents? At least one large male. Travelling quickly. Spending quite a bit of time under water - hopefully feeding - quite calm evening with no boat traffic at all! -Sandra Scott
(
per Monika - Probably 36,
36Bs, 99s

15:15 - Ts w/baby
...heading north
Rosario Strait
(Lat/Long 48.7195 -122.7495 off NW Lummi Island ). We on whale watch cruise from Friday harbor, San Juan Excursions. Best photo w iPhone (below). At one point, whales went down for quite a bit (6-10min??) baby came up twice. Someone thought saw seal in water- possible hunting? No flurry of activity. About 4-5 other boats watching too. Sea Lion there as well- just happen to remember it's name. I'm curious, do the naturalists on these whale watch boats pass along the data/photos they take? -Thanks for all you do! Julie Schlenger

Entry 3:
June 28th in
Boundary Pass near Monarch Head Saturna Island heading East
. Numbered about a dozen including a few mature males and a number of calfs travelling loosely in two groups. They followed the coastline in towards Narvaez Bay, then back out into Boundary Pass, followed by 5 or 6 whale boats and what probably was a SoundWatch boat flying the whale flag. We headed out to the lighthouse at East Point, where the orcas passed by around
1:30 PM. A mature male and female came up close to shore and appeared to be mating. They all passed Boiling Reef and headed out into the Strait of Georgia, where they lingered, heading slowly towards the mouth of the Frasier River. We could still see them about an hour later, whale boats in tow. The encounter very much resembled the encounters we typically have with the Southern Residents. No hunting behavior was observed. -Miles Ritter
(
Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research reviewed many photos: "The
T65As and T65Bs
are in these photos though there may have been other matrilines present."

Entry 5:
Cape Meares OR
today,
June 28th, and spotted four orcas in the water below. The lovely woman at the lighthouse gift shop phoned the number on the wall for you guys, but also asked me to send you some of the pictures I managed to take....I looked into the metadata on my camera, and it looks like it's incorrect, so the best I can give you is a rough estimate for time. It was before noon; I'd give my best estimate as
between
10:30 and noon
on the 28th. They were headed north, along the coast, and didn't stop. No one in the large group of people that spotted them noticed them breach the surface until they were fairly close to the cliff the lighthouse is on. My camera lens isn't particularly powerful - they were fairly close to the cliff there. Like I said, they didn't stop at all, however, not all of them came up all at once until after we'd been observing them for a short while; one of the larger ones surfaced first, and we all thought it was only one or two, until we clearly could see at least four of them. I can't say if there were any more than that, as they all swam fairly close together. -Hope these help! Thanks! Jessica Buswill
(
ID notes Melisa Pinnow, CWR: "These are the
T49As for sure. The T49Bs could be there too
though it is not clear in the photos." We will forward other images and update if more are confirmed -alb

Entry 6:
around Sooke with Transient / Biggs Killer Whales and humpback whales, incl. MMX0120 Ocean
almost everywhere on our morning and afternoon tours! We Love what we do! -Paul Pudwell

Entry 7:
16:39 - Two grey whales just north of Fort Nugent and West Beach
(West Whidbey Island) the last hour or so. -Deborah Bias

Entry 8:
18:45 - Humpback whale swimming north, north of the ferry lanes
closer to Whidbey. -Danielle Pennington

18:20 - Whale spotted off of Mukilteo
, north of the ferry dock. Thinking grey or minke (was a humpback -alb). Breached the surface then did a tail flip. Small fin....Seen from the ferry headed to Clinton, towards the start of the sailing perhaps 400' away. -Kristen Wagner-Patterson
*

12:34 - Humpback whale off of Madrona Ave in Everett
. I can't tell which direction he's going, he dove & I haven't seen him since....Definitely a humpback though. -Connie Mitchell
*

Entry 9:
9 or 10 minkes on Friday, from Hein Bank to Eastern Bank to Partridge Bank
. Didn't get photos of them all, sadly, but will post what might be ID'able! Interestingly 2 seemed to be traveling together, even surfacing together - hadn't seen them travel closely with buddies before. -Jill Hein
*
Minkes on Hein Bank

Entry 10:
About two weeks ago at least four orcas were seen not too far from shore in Tichenor Cove, Port Orford OR
. They seemed to be moving north/northwest. We very seldom see orcas in our waters. If we have another sighting, I will report immediately. I only just learned about your website. I regret that I
don't have a specific date
. It was thrilling to see them...Betty Olson
