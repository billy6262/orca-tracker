Chris - our Chief of Horizon Scanning in Room #5, yells: "
Orca
!!" just beyond the kelp line, a BIG pod,
at least seven
, possibly more, cruisin.' Magic. I still hold my breath when they dive, exhale when they do ...What the poet Jim Harrison said of porpoises rings true for Orca: (they) "dance for as long as they live. You can do nothing for them. They alter the universe." -Scott Hartman,
Bullman Bay Inn at Neah Bay

Entry 2:
19:15 -
My in-laws saw what was likely a gray whale or a humpback from their property on
Hood Canal this evening at
7:15pm
1.5 miles north of Hoodsport. They said it "was breaching then rolling and spouting. Very large (compared to orcas) and grey color. Awesome!" I believe it was headed north when they saw it. -Kelly Lauricella

I saw a
humpback in Hood Cana
l this morning, traveling northerly near the eastern shore
off Rendsland Creek and Musqueti Point
. There were several distinct Lobtailing slaps and large blows, before the whale disappeared to the north....I did not have a camera to get a photo of the sighting, but I do have a corroborating witness, we were on the beach doing crab survey for Washington Sea Grant at that time. There were also several tribal shrimp boats (Skokomish) in the area, too....The sighting was uncommon to say the least!! The lobtailing was pretty incredible-in fact it was a loud tail slap that first alerted me. We then saw several blows and more lobtailing over about a five minute span. -Kevin Stoops

08:07 -
Neighbors on the North Shore by Rendsland's Creek called me at
8:07 to report the
whale(s) breaching at Potlatch
. They thought it was more than one whale. Pretty cool! -Karla Oman

Entry 3:
Puget Sound - MMX0049 -
Notes by Tasli Shaw re: MMX0049: "Nice identification, this whale has not been documented in the Salish Sea since 2016. Nice new markings on the fluke as well."

is circling mid channel off of
