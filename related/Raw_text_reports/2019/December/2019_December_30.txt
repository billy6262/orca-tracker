Entry 3:
MMX0101 "Strike" today near the Belle Chains
getting a bit rowdy with
MMX0073 "Lorax"
.
(Erin Gless: Like two males being competitive rowdy?)
...that's what it looked like to me. Not full on competitive but getting there.
(Tasli Shaw: Lorax is female.)
...Interesting! There was a third whale with them but it never fluked so no ID shot. Maybe Strike's posturing was at that whale OR it wasn't posturing at all and just being goofy. Just seemed reminiscent of behaviors I've seen on the breeding grounds...
(Jeff Freidman: was def behavior I've seen from males in breeding waters. Bubble blasts and all). -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Maya's Legacy Whale Watch
