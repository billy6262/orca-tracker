Orca Sightings for December 20, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
J and K pods, along with 18 members of L pod, were heading west out the Strait of Juan de Fuca this afternoon
toward the Pacific, documented by field researcher Mark Malleson, according to Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

...They began the encounter at
1133
at 48 19.6/123 25.9 (~4 nm NE of Race Rocks) and quickly confirmed
several members of K pod
. The whales were spread to the north and southwest but all seemed more interested in foraging than going anywhere quickly.
J31 and calf J56 were foraging alongside K37
, and the youngest Southern Resident breached three or four times while mom searched for food.

Entry 2:
23:30 -
Was listening to the
LK hydrophone
at around
2:30am (ET) and heard a handful of calls. Not sure if it was SRKWs or Biggs but
definitely orcas
. Must have been traveling because I didn't hear them again. Short and sweet. Made me really happy. -Claudia Lorena

Entry 3:
K26
and a small group of Pacific white-sided dolphins joined the fray! The "lags" (from the scientific name for Pacific
white-sided dolphins, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens)
raced off towards a small group of killer whales less than a mile inshore of them, and the Mike 1 crew watched in anticipation of a meeting. The whales dove though, and the lags opted to play alongside Mike 1 for a few moments before disappearing to the east...
