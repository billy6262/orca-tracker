After departing the the
Bigg's killer whales approaching Albert Head
(see Encounter #102) Mark and Joe turned south in search of an outer-coastal group that had been left by a couple of the whale watch boats. These whales were last seen
heading east in the Juan de Fuca Strait a few miles south east of Race Rocks
. They spotted the
bull T251 (also known as CA166/U033)
in short order. He was
travelling stealthily to the NE ~ 5 nm SSE of Race Rocks
(48 14.2/123 26.1), and apparently alone, so after confirming his identity they continued on to find the rest of the group. With the help of Gord spotting from Victoria through Big Eyes, Mark and Joe were able to pick up a group of three animals, including
a weeks old calf
, only a few miles to the NW of
T251
. This group turned out to be more outer-coastals and the
new mother was confirmed to be T253
...Full report and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 103.

There were
at least three but I think four separate groups in JdF yesterday. T77s were one
, picked up west bound between Constance and Race.
75Bs and Cs were tight to shore Northeast of race milling and then headed east. Looks like T75C has a new calf
. I heard there were others south including at least
CA166
but we didn't see them. -Sara Hysong-Shiamzu, Maya's Legacy

Mark and Joe departed the dock at 1400 on Mike 1 after having multiple reports of killer whales in the vicinity of Race Rocks. The only confirmed ID at that point was
T251
, an outer coastal
Bigg's whale
that Mark had seen at the end of his morning whale watch trip guiding for Prince of Whales...Mike 1 arrived with the
most northerly group of animals at 1425
as they passed by the shoreline of
William Head
(48 20.5/123 31.4). This group was tracking north towards Victoria and Mark and Joe confirmed they were the
T077 matriline. T077 and T077B led the way across Quarantine Cove
...They departed the T077's and confirmed the T075B's and T075C's and saw a new calf swimming alongside T075C!...Full report and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 102.

Entry 2:
7:45 am
this morning my friend saw a tall thin dorsal fin about 300 yards off the shore of Whaler's Village condominiums in Des Moines. Remained in the area for repeated sightings about 15 minutes. (possibly rafting sea lion(s) - HG). -Always, Karen Keiser
