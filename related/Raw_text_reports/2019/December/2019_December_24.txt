Orca Sightings for December 24, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Dear Alisa,
Humpbacks
have been coming a lot in the Strait of Georgia. We followed a humpback close to shore, playing the in kelp, and then leisurely along the shore of
Mayne Island
on Dec 24. Then a big bunch came on Dec 25 and again on Dec 26. And now this morning (28th) at the tide line a few hundred yards into the straight this morning. I have movies of the humpback in kelp from Dec 24 if there is a way to send them your way. -Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island

Entry 2:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS - Tue Dec 24 - J pod - Puget Sound - You already have amazing photos from the 24th but I thought I would add a couple of my own. I don't have a zoom lens however but I was one of the lucky people on the
8am ferry heading to Mukilteo on Christmas Eve morning
who got to see what we thought were
10 orcas
. What a gift to be stopped in the middle of the crossing for what seemed like forever as we were treated to this amazing sight. We are so very blessed to live here. -Robin Olive Reich

Entry 3:
humpback and L Pod calls, K Pod was on the Lime Kiln hydrophones
(Dec 24)...couldn't confirm this until I reviewed the entire recording. On their way to Puget Sound?...or...spending time in the Strait of Juan de Fuca?...Jeanne Hyde
*

Entry 4:
J pod - Puget Sound, Christmas Eve - J pod and transient orcas graced Whidbey Island
waters today with an early wake up call of orcas in the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry lanes. Orca watchers were quick to get out of bed and relay reports of the
whales passing Sandy Point and Langley before continuing north in Saratoga Passage
. The whales were fairly well spread out as they
passed Fox Spit, foraging sporadically between Greenbank and Camano Island.
It seems all us Orca Dorks at Fox Spit missed the photo of the day of
L56's baby breach as the newest member of J pod and her mother (J31) slipped by
. Every encounter with these whales is special, but there's something extra special about a visit at this joyous time of the year. Happy Christmas!
J56 (Tofino) and mother J31 (Tsuchi) make a close pass at Fox Spit.

Hello. Today I saw 4, possibly 5 Orcas cruising through the
Skagit Bay
. I live in Oak Harbor and my home faces the bay. As I watched them go by, I noted that a few seals looked a little panicked and swam hurridly towards shore. I wanted to send this as well to be sure you received the information. Thank you for allowing me to tell you what I saw. Thank you for all that you do for the previous Orcas. -Sincerely, Trisha Ferreira, Oak Harbor WA
