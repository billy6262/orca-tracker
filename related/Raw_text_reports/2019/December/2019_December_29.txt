Orca Sightings for December 29, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
T137 pod today between Partridge Bank and Smith Island. T137A
appears to be much healthier than he was earlier in the year after his caudal peduncle wound. We didn't get a look at his back end yesterday or today, but he seems to be traveling at a normal pace with the rest of his family. In one of the shots you can see him traveling close to his sister,

Today was absolutely beautiful! Great conditions and awesome whales. We encountered the
T137s (only T137A Jack
pictured) near
Partridge Bank
with Mt. Baker in the background. Then after a scenic trip through Deception Pass and Saratoga Passage, we encountered our first returning Gray Whale to the Snohomish River Delta since they (presumably) departed the area in late Spring! Gray Whale #2246 was in shallow water near Everett hopefully feeding on plenty of Ghost Shrimp! -Justine Buckmaster

Entry 2:
11:43 - Orca in Strait of Juan De Fuca
being viewed from Coho Ferry (was just few miles from PA at time of report).
Heading toward Port Townsend
. I saw about three I believe two female and on male. They were far off and hard to see. Another couple saw them earlier circling a sailboat. I don't think it's one of the larger pods. They did seem kind of spread out. -Brianna Schroeder

Sun Dec 29 - Strait of Georgia - Dear Alisa, Thanks a lot for the ID on the orcas. So cool!! Today, the
Humpbacks
put an incredible show for 1 hour at about 3pm with breaching behaviour, big flukes, side flipping (lifting flippers up and slamming the water). There were
2 humpbacks of similar size
doing all this together. Is is mating behaviour? What does the breaching mean and the side flipping? It was all in the
strait of Georgia, a few hundred yards from shore on Mayne island (Edith Point)
, directly opposite me. Photos taken from shore. -Cheers, Yves Tiberghien

Entry 5:
11:08 -
Hey, So I was listening to the
Lime Kiln Hydrophone right now and I can hear whales
. I think they're orcas (they were humpbacks -alb), but I am not 100 percent sure. They're making whistly sounds and kinda clicky/snorty ones as well. (Sorry for the terrible description.) They were quiet at first, but now they're louder and there are more of them. I hope you have an awesome holiday season....I started to hear them at about
10:58 and heard them until
11:17 ish. I forgot to mention that in my first email. super sorry about that. -Katie McDermott

Sun Dec 29 - San Juan Channel - Grey (I believe) whale at entrance to Friday Harbor, surfaced then passed in front of ferry leaving at

8:10am
. Beautiful morning!...heading north....UPDATED TO: Thanks for the details! So this was a
humpback
, clearly had a dorsal fin and was smooth dark grey. Surfaced within 70 feet from us... beautiful! -Kristi Jones

It looks like

is back already to bring in the new year! We spotted him/her on the edge of the
Snohomish River Delta
today from Chilkat Express. -Bart Rulon, Photographer/Naturalist Puget Sound Express.
