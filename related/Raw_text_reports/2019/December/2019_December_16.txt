============================================================

Entry 1:
BIGG'S TRANSIENT KILLER WHALES - Mon Dec 16...They slowed in the southeasterly swell in order to lock on to the killer whale, and began the encounter at
1250 ~3.5 nm ENE of William Head
(48 21.9/123 26.7). No other killer whale fins or blows were seen, and they moved closer to confirm
a lone male Bigg's whale. T097
was travelling ENE steadily, until ten minutes into the encounter when he nabbed a small mammal, likely a harbour seal or harbour porpoise. -Full report and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 104.
