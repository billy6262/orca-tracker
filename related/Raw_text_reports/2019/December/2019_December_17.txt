Orca Sightings for December 17, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tue Dec 17...For a short while, it was very super pod like behavior. More whales were trickling in from the west and these were
mostly K pod whales along with a few more Ls.
After searching many groups, it became clear that the
L12s, L54s, and L88 were not present
this day
but all the Js, Ks, L4s, L47s, L72s, L90, and L87 were
. All whales present were photographed by the end of the encounter. Once the eastbound Ks and Ls met the others, all the whales began moving easterly but very slowly and there was a lot of milling and socializing still going on. The encounter ended at
1310 about a mile and a half or so southeast of Trial Island with most of the spread out groups heading due east

:

14:50-

14:58 - A pair very far out
. I was disappointed to see a vessel almost over one whale, moving with it.

12:52-

13:50 -
A pair very far out drifting north to south and back while moving away from SJI, surfacing many many times.

10:45 -

11:13 -
The third pair moving to the south ever so slowly, surfacing many times. One individual had a blunted fin and one a curved fin. In the past when I would see the humpbacks they pass through quickly. To see them behaving like this was a joyful relaxing experience.

10:45 -
A second pair close in moving to the south, surfacing 3 times in unison.

10:10 -

10:55 -
The first pair was far out drifting south, then slowly west away from the island, close together & interacting, tail lobbing, many pectoral slaps and one floated on it's back fins raised. Photos attached. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

I have what appears to be
a Gray Whale feeding off of Everett
. It's totally out of season but it is here up on the flat in the usual spot behaving the way Gray Whales typically behave. Will try for photos but only have my phone...I was up on the large eel grass flat off of Jetty Island. Slightly South of the shallow water marker out on the edge of the flat and about half way from the marker to the island itself. At that tide level it was about` ten or twelve feet of water in there. I watched the Whale for about 45 min or more. Due to the shallow water it wasn't arching up to dive you couldn't see the body very well it was just coming up to blow and then going back down. Part of the time it was making a visible surface disturbance as it moved around. One time it rolled on it's side and put a pectoral fin up. One other time it came up and showed part of it's back out of the water. Seemed like a smaller Whale. I lost track of it after that while I was texting you. -John Judy
