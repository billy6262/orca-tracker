Morning of Christmas day, Deb Stewart alerted Orca Network orcas were

9:06 am they were just north of me and within a minute or so made their pass by swiftly again. I was truly blessed with orca love...Christmas morning. also first time I was successful with camcorder. All these shots are still shots off video. There were a total of 8 orcas that I had counted...members of
J pod
