Orca Sightings for December 28, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orcas suddenly appeared in the same area (Mayne Island - Strait of Georgia)
as I was taking photos of the
humpbacks
... first time we see them together. At the tideline, busy waters. Which ones are they? (Melisa Pinnow reviewed half dozen photos: They are Ts, perhaps the
T36Bs and T99s
). -Yves Tiberghien

Entry 2:
15:07 -
hearing something... Not sure if it's orcas, but there's chirps every now and then. If it is the pod, they aren't super talkative.

14:30 -
Pretty sure I'm hearing them on the
Port Townsend hydrophone
, but I think there may be a ship now? -Ashley Whitman

13:50 -
we left the
T137 pod
still eastbound towards Point Wilson
well north of Protection Island
. Just made a kill and had a meal before swimming eastward again.

13:15 -
MV Saratoga found the
T137 pod south of Partridge Bank
currently eastbound and aiming toward Admiralty Inlet and Puget Sound. It's possible they might make it into the sound later today. -Bart Rulon

12:57 - Biggs Orca, T137s are at Partridge Bank
pointed at Admiralty Inlet, Pt Wilson, probably be there around 2. -Cristopher Hanke

Entry 3:
Orca Pod in Alsea Bay, OR
. Multiple spouts. No males spotted. Hunting harbor seals. -Regards, Lauri Hines

Entry 4:
11:59 -
Hi Alisa, my husband just crossed from Hat to Everett, called to report
gray whale blows between south tip of Hat and Mukliteo
head, just past the barge that anchors out there. One individual, no direction apparent. -Lori Christopher
