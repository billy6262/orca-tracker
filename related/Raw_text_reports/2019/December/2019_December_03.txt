T028B
during a hunt southwest of
Sooke, BC. T030B
during a steller sealion hunt on the morning of
December 3rd in the
Juan de Fuca Strait

Entry 2:
Mark spotted several killer whales just to the west, apparently headed SSE. They began the encounter here at 1150 (48 15.2/123 44.2). These whales turned out to be several of the
T046Bs
; the T046B1s were spotted just under a mile south. All of the whales turned west on the next surfacing, and Joe spotted several more blows approximately 1.5 miles west of them. Mark and Joe made their way slowly towards this larger group and were rewarded with the early stages of a Steller sea lion hunt at 1203 (48 14.4/123 47.2). The animals involved turned out to be the
T028Bs, T030Bs, T117B, T121As and T172
, several rare visitors to the Salish Sea. The T046Bs arrived in their matrilineal groups and waited on the periphery of the hunt, along with
T117A
. The large group continuously rammed and breached upon the sea lion, and had pulled it under within 30 minutes. The T046Bs and later T117A joined the predation and all whales fed for close to an hour as they drifted west with the ebb current...Full summary report and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 99.
