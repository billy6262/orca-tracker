Hello you probably heard already, but today (Jan. 18) we saw a Pod from the Ferry between
Edmonds and Kingston
about 1 pm. They were about a mile south of the ferry lanes, looked like heading east. Pretty much about half way across. The ferry crew made an announcement to the passengers letting people know they were visible. Hopefully you have the ferry crews trained to report these sightings too. Anyway good luck in your endeavors to protect and save the southern resident pods. -David Kutz

ID notes by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "Yes, that looks like it is probably Stump, but not quite clear enough to say for certain. If one of the unidentified dolphins also has a bent dorsal fin, it would be easy to confuse them."
