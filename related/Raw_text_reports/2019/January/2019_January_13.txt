Entry 1:
3pm ish - Malaspina Straight, between Powell River and Harwood Island - Orcas
spotted -
looked like 6, one looked like a baby
. I dont have a great camera, but here is what I have. I was very excited to see them. There were also a huge number of transient Stellar and California sea lions in the area and a school of dolphins went by Blubber Bay yesterday as well. -Photos by Shann Carmichael, Powell River, BC (
ID notes by Melisa Pinnow, CWR after reviewing Shanns's 4 images: "See the
T46s and T101s
for sure.
Perhaps the T124As
as well"

Dalco Passage
viewpoint on the 5 mile drive about

2:30 pm

I was viewing from the north end ferry boat as it was headed away from
Vashon towards Fauntleroy
. Saw one male leader quickly headed south down the east end of the island, then a pod of 5-6 or so bunched up, about a mile or so behind headed south as well. They were being a bit scattered on their direction but lost sight
of them as they were headed more towards Dilworth Vashon.

10:50 - larger pod southbound, hard to say but counted possibly
5-6 or so, headed south,
east side of Vashon
, but closer to the mainland.

10:34 - viewing from North end Vashon ferry terminal, one adult male orca headed south on the east side of the Island mid channel, haven't seen any other fins yet. -Marla Smith

10:40 -
We saw orcas this morning at 10 AM between
Blake Island and Seattle
mid channel traveling south. It may have been two groups, several large dorsals traveling quickly, and a slower group of about 6-8 individuals with smaller profiles. The group was last spotted
south of the Fauntleroy ferry
closer to the east side of the Sound around
10:40ish. -Thanks, Brenna Sowder

(one male & two females) spotted north of Blake Island.

Entry 7:

Sun Jan 13 - Good morning. Spotted blows across the sound this morning. Too far away to be able to confirm what type, but I can only assume it's a
grey
that has been hanging around over winter (map shows mouth of
Snohomish Delta
). -Danielle Pennington
