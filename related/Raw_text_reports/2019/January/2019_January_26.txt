Entry 6:
11:00 -
Gray whale sighted 1-26-2019 @
11:00 AM. 1/4 mile
north of Golden Gardens
/ Meadow Point buoy. 150 yards offshore. Heading south...I assumed Gray whale but honestly cannot be certain. We have seen humpback whales in the past but they were in groups and they were jumping which made them easy to identify as we have seen them in Hawaii. This was a solitary whale with not much coming out of the water as it moved its way along which is more similar to what I have seen of gray whales in the past.Thanks for your work with all the whales! -Walt Spady
(
Either gray or humpback are possible
. A humpback showed up in Elliott Bay 4 hours later - alb

Entry 7:

14:00 -
I seen a whale off Anderson Point (
just north of Prospect Point, Colvos Passage
) headed north 50 to 75 feet off shore. Spouted, then tail. Looked like a smaller whale. Baby
gray
maybe. Ferry stopped soon after assuming the captain seen it. Ferry was stopped for about 20 min in the middle of the passage and lots of birds....I'm as confused as you are about that (ferry in Colvos Passage - alb). My mom and I were wondering what ferry it was and what it was doing. -Bryan Kelly

10:15 - Small whale went past Owen Beach in Tacoma about
10:15 this morning. It was going south. Not sure if it was a
gray or humpback
. Some who saw it better said it did not appear to be well. -Melissa Malott
