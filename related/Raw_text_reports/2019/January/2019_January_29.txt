ID notes by Dave Ellifrit, CWR: "best I can say is that they are transients. I don't know that left whale off the top of my head and it wasn't who I thought it might be." Melisa Pinnow, CWR wasn't sure who they were either.

13:30.
Whale turned around in Gull Harbor and then traveled up the eastern shore - very close to shore - passing Boston Harbor Marina. It then crossed across the bay heading west toward Hunter Point. I have lost sight - but not sound - of its blows. Slow, rolling surfacing series. Some longer dives than others. I never saw a fluke. Very robust blows.

12:40. Humpback
is still in
Budd Inlet
. It is now on the eastern shore in Gull Harbor. Gull Harbor is in the distance (behind the blow/whale) in the above photo.

11:15 - Humpback
heading south into
Budd Inlet
- passing the tip of Cooper Point and on the western shore. Traveling at a slow, surfacing series, pace. This is the last image I have of it (taken from my deck) as it crossed the bay into Eld Inlet heading west toward Hunter Point. That is the southern end of Harstine Island in the background. -Kim Merriman
