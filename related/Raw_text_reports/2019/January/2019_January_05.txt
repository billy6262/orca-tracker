============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait - At
1435
, an update came in that the
whales were in line between Ten Mile Point and Henry Island
. "Morning Star" was right in the zone and spotted the whales about a mile away
at 1510...It was T93 and T97
and they were a few miles east of Cordova Bay/Gordon Head area. The two males were milling about on an apparent kill...Full report and images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 1.

~
1:30pm -
I have reports with pictures (see Greg Williamson photo below) from the Anderson Island FB group of
orcas westbound through Balch Passage between Anderson and McNeil islands
. I'm headed to see if I can get eyes on where they went. We also had reports of whales heard heading the opposite direction last night at twilight, so it may be the group from Commencement Bay yesterday. -Belen Bilgic Schneider

13:07 -
We saw them on our down south in the boat today...we were
between Key Peninsula and Anderson Island
. They were headed north, but once they passed us it looked like they turned around. Then we lost sight of them. This video was taken at
1:07pm today. Maybe this helps. Cheers! -Kathryn Boender
