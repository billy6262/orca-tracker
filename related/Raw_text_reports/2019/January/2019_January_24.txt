Entry 2:
15:50 -
Allie Hudec called from the ferry docked at
Clinton
. She saw a
small gray whale
heading north past Hat Island up Saratoga Passage. DOLPHINS - Thu Jan 24 - Of note; reply by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research in response to report of
dolphins (probably porpoise due to numbers) near Anderson Island
: "The common dolphins are still down here, but they are down to three animals from the original 8. As for bottlenose, there are reports of Stump being joined by two others at times, though they don't like the shallows the way that she does, so we never get pictures of them..."

Since about

9:30 a.m.
, my neighbors and I have watched what we believe is a
bottlenose dolphin
off shore of West Seattle one mile south of Fauntleroy ferry dock. It surfaces multiple times and then is underwater for longer periods and then resurfaces. Haven't seen it since about
10:05 a.m. can't give you direction of travel. -Carolyn Duncan
