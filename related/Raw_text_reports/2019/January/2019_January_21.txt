Orca Sightings for January 21, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
SOUTHERN RESIDENTS -

17:00 now between the lighthouse and PT Ferry dock
. Loosing light quickly. 1

6:47
- - group seems to be heading steadily north now. Still
south of Fort Casey
closer to the port Townsend side.

16:16
they're really spread out. A large male and one female in the lead heading north. Still south of the ferry lane

15:56 -
Group I'm watching
south of Fort Casey
is just milling about. Still a long way south of the ferry lane. Lots of spy hops! Water is very calm. -Dan Gulden
*

4:11 - Fort Flagler
mid channel. Young one and about 4 adults. -Wally KeeKee BoBo
*

16:00 pm -
they are headed
north past Fort Flagler
. -Teresa Lang
*

15:39 - Orcas
. Male and others going
past Lagoon Pt
spread out. They were in really small groups, first one about 4, then two or three groups of 2 at least, mid channel so no good looks at dorsals. Lovely though distant looks at
orcas (Js) from Lagoon Point
. About 7+ though in small groups, spread out. Beautiful to see their backlit blows! -Bonnie Gretz

15:30 -

16:00 -
I travelled up to
Fort Flagler
today to hopefully spot the orcas trending northbound this afternoon. It was a beautiful afternoon and the whales finally started moving north from Bush Point around

3:30-4pm. They were mid channel to ft Flagler...seemed way to far away for decent photos. Those images were all heavily cropped. I do have some wider angle shots to give more perspective if you would like to see. So glad I impulsively decided to drive up there...lots of people stopped by to ask what I was seeing. Happy Day!

group of two fairly close to Whidbey at the
southern end of Lagoon Point
.

15:01 - Orcas
. lots of activity (breaches, spy hops, fin slaps) visible from
Lagoon Point
. Mid channel, but closer to Marrowstone. I'm on a bluff at the very southern tip of Lagoon point. I am high enough that I can see far across the channel. They are much closer to Marrowstone. -Margaret Marshall

15:30 - J27
came closest to us at
Bush Pt. as J pod

Entry 3:
*
It's always a beautiful day when you see whales, but considering it's only January today was exceptional with calm seas and warm sunshine prevailing as members of the Southern Resident community edged north in Admiralty Inlet after an early start bringing the
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry
to a halt earlier this morning, a welcome diversion for commuters. Although many of the whales had already passed Possession boat ramp when we arrived, the trailers were closer to the Whidbey side giving us early birds a breakfast boost as they streamed by in singles, doubles and more. It was over all too soon, so those of us who can never get enough of orca encounters kept track of the whales as they entered Admiralty Inlet, waiting patiently at Bush Point for their arrival. Although we cannot be sure who exactly was there,
J27 (Blackberry)
was recognized and there were rumors of a calf, so perhaps some L pod whales were also present (
no new calf or Ls were documented, presumably calf seen was J53 Kiki - alb
). One thing's for sure, yet again we were privileged to see these charismatic creatures, the sight of which serves only to increase our determination that we do all we can to ensure they survive. -Sandra Pollard

15:04 - 3 orcas at Bush Point
right now. -Daisy Polack

14:56 - Calls on the Bush Point hydrophone
...they weren't very loud either. I've been listening to the hydrophone off and on since about 2pm waiting to hear them. Posted that as soon as I heard calls and almost right after I could hear a boat accelerating & no more calls. -Meg Sellers
*

14:50 - Js still slowly passing Bush Point
, very spread out mid channel. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Getting more difficult to see the orcas as they've spread out and drifted further towards mid channel. I did just spot a small group, including large male, still east of mid channel southbound, sightline
between Eglon, Kitsap and north of Edmonds ferry
dock.

09:50 -
At least some of the orcas have stalled, drifted further west offshore from
Edmonds
. Now more south of Cultus Bay, spread out along all the fishing boats. Several breaches by more NW group, while others trending southbound, not in a hurry.

Entry 5:
16:45 - Howe Sound
opposite Furry Creek swimming north,
3 orcas

*

Entry 6:
~

11:00-

11:20 - Saw a humpback
moving north off
Discovery Park
near the lighthouse. Lost sight of it in the bay next to Ballard Marina. I believe it's a humpback because of the shape of the dorsal fin, spouting, and how large the animal was when it surfaced. -Kayla Graham
*

Entry 7:
15:00 -
Christine Baldwin reports
grays off Langley
.
*

14:30 -
Shari Devlin, Langley Whale Center, reports
2 grays right off shore in Langley

*

Entry 8:
17:13 -
It has been going up and down the beach for over an hour so far...Close to
Luna Park
and it was too dark to tell after sunset, but was swimming between Luna Park and the volley ball section of the beach 3-4 times times while we watched.

17:01
- Just seen this off of
Alki
. -Jayce Lemmer
(
Jayce's video, not included here, was reviewed by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "The behavior and shape of the dorsal fin is what I would expect from a
bottlenose
."
)
*
Something going on in
Elliot Bay
. I can't confirm, but looked like an orca. Sadly, someone from a group of 6 kayakers looks to be taking the opportunity to pursue it for a better view. -Dan Tierny
*

Entry 9:
13:20 - Common dolphins near Herron Island
, highlighting info from your video- falcate dorsal fin, jumping out of the water, and always approaching boats to bowride or wake jump. -Nick Wenzel
(
ID & notes by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective: "That is the one we call
Big Back Notch
, for obvious reasons, The notch is not a new injury, he has had that since he arrived. We assume it is a old male due to it's prominent ventral keel. He is one of the original group of animals from
June 2016."
