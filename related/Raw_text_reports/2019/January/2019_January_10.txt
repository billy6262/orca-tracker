Taken from
Point Robinson
Lighthouse on Maury Island about

12:55pm
this afternoon...telephoto breach shot, shortly after I arrived at Point Robinson. This group I photographed was heading south toward us at Point Robinson - but turned around just after I shot this, and headed back north toward 3 Tree Point. I can't confirm, but before I arrived there was apparently an earlier group (K Pod?) that went past Point Robinson and continued on toward the Ruston/Pt. Defiance area. I assumed the group that turned around was the same group I saw later from the Vashon Ferry.

I didn't have eyes on them myself; sounds like a large group, spread out, favoring the east side of the sound between the traffic lanes and the shore. I just took a good look up that way from Alki Point but couldn't see anything yet.

Victoria Clipper V reports
orcas southbound at West Point at

Entry 7:
L pod and Bigg's were in the same area
. Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research has ID'd the
T36Bs and T137s
in the Komo News video at same time Ls were heading northbound opposite side of the Sound. See Kersti Muul's observations - alb)
*

14:39 pm
- I was on shore under the chopper. King 5 helicopter footage that says it's just residents has
several minutes of the transients going southbound in the very beginning of the video. This was the same time as the residents were heading northbound.
The transients at no point turned around and went North in their travels into the same relative area as the residents.
Ts were occupying the Seattle shore while the residents were occupying Kitsap directly adjacent to each other. T137 passed by Coleman pool no more than 50 yards off shore.
I believe there were more than just the T137 matriline present. -Kersti Muul
*
