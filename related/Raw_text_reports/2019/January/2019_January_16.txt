I could hear them from my deck as they were slightly south of me in
Eld Inlet
. They headed quickly north out of Eld Inlet.
At least 6. Maybe 8
. I missed them heading south into the inlet. They did a short surfacing series right at Cooper Point and then a long dive across to the eastern shore near Boston Harbor (Budd Inlet). Surfaced again three times north of Zangle Cove. I lost sight of them as they passed the southern tip of Harstine Island going north into Dana Passage.
