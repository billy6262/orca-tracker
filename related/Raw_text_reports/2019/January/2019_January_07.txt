There was a pod of
orcas spotted off Shilshole Bay around
2:45
today! I believe they were traveling South. Mid channel. I work at Argosy Cruises and one of my captains reported they saw them on our Locks sightseeing cruises....(per video look like at least 3). -Mallory Walker, Argosy Cruises

Entry 2:
About 10 Orcas passed Turn Point Light Station on Stuart Island at
11:15 am.
They were traveling northbound. Once past the point they dove and didn't resurface until they were about a quarter mile north. -Jim Bergquist

Entry 3:
humpback
whale, seemed small maybe a juvenile, traveling from mid channel between Hat Island and Whidbey Island. It headed towards the east side of Whidbey. It took about a half hour to cross the channel from
10:30am to
11:00am this morning 1-7-10....I was pretty high up on a cliff but had binoculars. In the lighting it looked dark almost black with a bump at the top of the head and another bump farther down on the top of the spine. I looked it up and it seemed to be a humpback, but I am not experienced so
maybe it was a gray
. I had seen a gray last spring going to the same feeding area. -Jennifer Wetmore (
could be either, but grays have been confirmed in the area - alb
)
