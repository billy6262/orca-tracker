Orca Sightings for January 15, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was told by a construction worker on site here, that
"about three orcas"
passed by close to shore during the
late afternoon
, heading south. This location is about
.75 miles south of the Fauntleroy Ferry Dock
. The number and proximity of the orcas is consistent with transients. -Jim Nunn
*

15:21 -
I saw the same group of three (or more) nearing
bainbridge
, closer to the island side about 10 minutes ago (~
15:10) . About 15 minutes prior to that (
14:55) I saw one orca around Blue Ridge area, east side of mid channel much closer to the Blue Ridge side. -Sir Winston

14:55 -
Group of
3
traveling south slowly mid channel
between north end of golden gardens and Fay bainbridge park

14:41 -
Near yellow buoy just south of
Edmonds ferry lane
(frequent direction change). -Mike Ferdinandi
*

14:10 -
looks like they're slowly moving south, and definitely west toward
Bainbridge
. -Elizabeth Burstad Morgan
*

13:37 - pod
is spread out. Currently making slow moving directional changes two north of and 2 north west of weather buoy off
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
.

13:00 pm.
The pod has passed
Edmonds
, nearing north End Richmond Beach about now. They moved offshore some. But still East of mid channel. Steady
southbound
with some directional changes. RB Saltwater Park would be good viewing.
T36, T137D, T137A

12:30. Pod resumed southbound.
Just now passing in front of
Edmonds Ferry dock
. Pretty close in. So sweet and lovely. Edmonds Marina Beach/dog park would be good place

12:11 -
looks like at least the
T137s
, about 1.5 miles off shore north Edmonds where Lila spotted them. Quietly Milling/circling slowly in glassy calm seas. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
(
ID notes: I thought we had just the
T137s
trailing off Edmonds but Melisa Pinnow ID'd
T36
present in Julia Wiese images above so presume she is in my video below and believe the
T36Bs
to be ahead many miles
)
*

12:45 - Two possibly 3 orcas
just passed
Point Edwards (Edmonds Beach)

Entry 2:
(
IDs by Melisa Pinnow Center for Whale Research
)

12:03 - One orca
heading mid channel maybe a mile or few north of the ferry?

11:54 -
Fin/spout spotted just
north of Edmonds ferry
!! Browns Bay I think?
T137s off Edmonds.
-Lila Burns

10:15 - Orcas
crossing the
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes
, a few in the first group and 3 in the second group (including the male) about a mile behind them headed south. -Melissa SImmons, WSF

10:08 -
Just saw
two orcas from the Clinton - Mukilteo ferry
! -Luanne Seymour

0915 - 3 orcas in Saratoga Passage, south of Sandy Point
, north of Witter Beach! A wonderful and heartening show! -Larry Nichols
*

08:45 - Spotted 3 Orca Whales
foraging for fish in
Saratoga Passage
and swimming south south east toward Langley. I thought that I heard other Whale Blows downstream from where I spotted the whales, not confirmed...When I first spotted the Whales they were out towards the middle of Saratoga Passage, in front of
Bells Beach
. The Whales spent sometime swimming, zigzagging and coming around like they were chasing fish; before swimming south. -Paul Joseph (Joe) Wolcott
