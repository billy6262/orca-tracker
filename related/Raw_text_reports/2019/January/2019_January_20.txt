Friend and neighbor Danielle posts on Orca Network this morning that
orcas at the ferry around
7:45 AM.
Put on boots and coat and head out. Pick up Danielle to get to
Glendale Beach
. Took a while for them to get down there and they had crossed Possession Sound and were much
closer to the mainland
side of the channel than the Whidbey side but an hour later orcas were STILL passing by. Expecting to head out and spend a few moments seeing a small family of Bigg's orcas, it became obvious as we started getting better looks at sheer number, behavior and dorsals that we had Southern Residents even though I didn't see any open saddles. I'm pretty sure I saw Blackberry, Princess Angeline and Kiki for sure.
I think all of J Pod present because we probably saw 20 whales.
Then we headed down to Possession where we caught up with Dori, Rachel and Durand and saw the trailers foraging. Finally a quick stop at Scatchet Head where I saw one very, very distant breach. Wow - J Pod not even on my radar when I woke up this morning even though it did feel like an orca day.

10:11 -
viewing trailers from
Scatchet Head
waaayyy in the distance still
heading south
. Saw one breach.

09:39 -
still have some midchannel
Possession heading south but also foraging. J Pod!

here. Most of them passed further away on the other side, but my boy J27 Blackberry and a few others
Matriarch J17 Princess Angeline (born 1977)
passed by closer to Whidbey. -Rachel Haight
*

still heading south, I counted at least
8 or 9, may be more
. I'm heading down to Edmonds.

Orcas
were announced by the Ferry captain as we waited to depart the
Clinton
terminal this morning at
8am
. I couldn't count them because there were several and they were spread far apart. Initially they were between us at the terminal and Camano Island, but as we departed and turned right for Mukilteo they crossed ahead of us and some could be seen to the port and others to the starboard between us and the Clinton-bound ferry. -Steven Pearson

07:56 -
Just passing the ferry dock now. Saw 3 with one male.

07:46 - Orcas off Clinton ferry dock
heading south. -Danielle Pennington

Entry 2:
15:06 - Gray whale
just passed
Pebble Beach
heading north. Close to shore. With all the wave chop today it was hard to spot the gray as it swam by. It passed by Pebble Beach close to shore just after 3, and moved north. We only spotted it because the spray was backlit by the sun when it first blew. Was nearly out of sight by the time we had the camera ready. -Peg Boley
