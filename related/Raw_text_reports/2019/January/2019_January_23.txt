14:00 -
This afternoon around 2 PM, we noticed about
5 to 10 Orcas, at Davis Bay, Sechelt BC
Canada. Amazing! We are sure at least one male, with large dorsal. They where heading up the Strait, towards Powell River. -Cornelia van Berkel

15:30 -

16:00 -
We saw a pod of approximately
4-6 orcas 400-500 m off Royal Bay Beach
. They were traveling towards
Victoria
(eastbound -alb) at a decent pace, making a few short dives then traveling under in a longer dive. No breaching or spy hopping, just travelling. Unfortunately not (photos), they weren't close enough and we didn't have binoculars. ... From what we could tell, they're weren't any distinctive individuals, judging by size. -Jasmine R

Entry 3:
12:38 to report one orca, 1 mile north of Alki Pt
, heading north.
(
We had no other reports of this or any orcas in Puget Sound. Another possibility is a lone Bottlenose dolphin who sometimes shows up in that area and spent most of Monday (21st) around there. - alb

Entry 4:
Ft Ebey at around 1230
today.
Seems to be a humpback
...definitely a dorsal fin versus the knuckle now that I look back at my own gray whale encounters. It hugged the shoreline and was cruising out West! -Christine Hawkins
(
video shared did appear to be a
humpback
- alb

Entry 5:
08:16 - A gray whale feeding in Elger Bay

Entry 6:
A Minke Whale visited Elger Bay
the morning of
January 23, about two hundred yards from our house. The house is high bank waterfront, up 80 some feet, always good for Whale Watching. It was here from
6 am to about 9 or ten
.... I knew right away that it was not a Grey Whale. We see them every year. I looked in my Marine Wildlife book by Steve Yates. Orca, Grey and Minke. The Minke is very distinctive, very streamlined, certainly beautiful....Occasionally it rested on the surface, looking rather like a log. And that's what Sally thought it was until it started to swim. The tide may have something do all this. A 13 foot tide floats the logs off the beach.I must say this is one my favorite naturalist experiences. I was once a Park Ranger/Naturalist for City of Bellevue,WA. I personally know that this sighting is true. Behavior definitely not Grey Whale. We see them every year. It was in front of house for hours, generally about no more than 200 to 300 yards away. Definitely a Minke Whale. -Jared Robinson
