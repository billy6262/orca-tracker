Orca Sightings for August 8, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Strait of Juan de Fuca
- Clouds from the morning were lifting and the Olympics were starting to peak through. We headed north across the straits as
the T137's, a marine mammal eating family of orcas
were reported and since they were heading west we knew we had to catch up with them. We arrived on scene to find
T137 and her 3 calves T137A, T137B and T137D
all swimming along with lots of surface time. One of the younger calves was a little playful throwing a few tail slaps and a spyhop in the mix...Island Adventures
