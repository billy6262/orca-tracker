2 orca traveling S/SE from Edwards Point/Westside Preserve
toward and past Hannah Hts. They were pretty far out moving quickly.

20:15 - 3 orca, including a large male, wandering S/SE from Edwards Point/Westside Preserve toward and past Hannah Hts

11:25 -

12:20 - Haro Strait -
Observed from shore at the northernmost edge of
Hannah Hts. I observed 8-10 orca including 2 large males
hunting with fish jumping everywhere. The orca were in a fishing spot they often favorite. They were generally moving to the N and 2 orca did swim past Edwards Point. The rest stayed and slowly worked their way southward again and some far out towards Strait of Juan de Fuca (sightline directionally) away from Pile Point. I identified
J16 Slick, J42 Echo, J26 Mike, J37 Hy" Shqa and J49 T'ilem I'nges
. If my ID's are correct; for a time Echo and her brother Mike were together. Later Mike was joined by Hy'Shqa and her son T'ilem I'nges. There were other orcas to my south nearer to Pile Point but I could only see the boats and those orca didn't move north. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

Entry 4:
N/NW edge of Hannah Hts
, observed a
humpback
traveling to the S/SE. It was very close in to the shore and surfaced 5 times. It had a blunted dorsal fin. Just lovely as it passed by. -Michelline Halliday, SJI
*

07:15 - Humpback
at 0715 off south west corner of
Henry Island
heading south off San Juan Island. -Julie Davis Lawrence
*

Entry 5:
humpback
(initially reported as orca) this morning while fishing at
Point No Point
. It rounded the point from the south and was heading west towards Hansville. Follow up: thanks for asking those clarifying questions. After talking to him more he's pretty confident that it was a humpback, did not have the right orca dorsal fin. Re; time: I'm not sure exactly but he was there between

5:30 and
7:30 this morning
. -Krisandra Allen
