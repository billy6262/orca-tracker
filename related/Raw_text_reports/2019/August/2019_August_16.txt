19:40 -
more conversations on
LK hydrophone ending at
7:40 and 15 minutes later 11 individuals appeared far out traveling to the South
. They were spread out but all turned towards SJI and came closer near Hannah Heights and then continued down island out of sight. I saw 4 breaches at dusk. I heard them until
8:35pm. Fish were jumping all over the place. I trust they are finding prey. -Michelline Halliday

18:16 -
Hi Alisa, They're still out here. They're right
off Smugglers Cove "Cove"
and there's NO boats anywhere. Again, yay!

18:08 -
I've been in heaven today...Along with the Orcas this morning, a large school of porpoises were hugging the shore and a seal was sitting it out on a rock on our point. At
3:30 today a large group of orcas swam through going north again, and because of their number, they must be Residents. And just now at
5:30 they came back through going south. They were definitely doing some serious fishing! Yay!!! I hope they did well. I got a video of them if you'd like to see it, please let me know how I can send it to you. -Laura Good

Much socializing in this group! I turned on LK hydrophone 15 minutes later and heard amazing conversations. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

J pod
was on the west side of
San Juan Island
early in the morning so Dave, Mia, and Conor headed down to Snug Harbor and left in the boat at
0830

Kanaka Bay at 0900
...The encounter ended at 1220 south of Hannah Heights with the whales still heading north. J pod passed CWR at 1540 still heading north although they later turned around again. -Full summary with images at Center for Whale Research Encounter 53.

10:05 - Haro Strait SJI - 6 orca
one at a time, all in a row traveled quickly to the SSE from

At least
10 SRKWs 1km offshore of False Bay
surface active & foraging. Lots of echolocation, J pod calls, and some whistles in a very quiet Salish Sea. But now there's speedboat noise (though we can't yet see the vessel!)... No clear direction, but trending north. -Scott Veirs

Entry 2:

08:30 - Five Orcas went through Haro Strait
an hour ago (~
08:30) headed north toward the
west side of Henry Island
. Do you have any idea if they might be Resident or transients? They hung out for a while fishing so, they never came close to shore. -Laura Goode, Smugglers Cove Road

Fri Aug 16 - Puget Sound - Forward by Brad Hanson NOAA: Brad, I am taking the main line calls...A woman who lives on the Sound in
Des Moines
reported that she spotted
a Minke whale (twice)
and thought someone might want to know about it. She said it was not a Humpback and not an Orca. It was shiny black with a small dorsal fin. She does not need a call back, so this is just informational. -Thanks, Alicia Matter, NOAA/NWFSC

Not Orca, but just as cool!!!
A dozen or so porpoises and maybe dolphin?

north of the Vashon ferry terminal
. VERY active this morning!!! Milling around in the area with no real direction of travel at 0710...grey, not the shiny black I'm used to seeing for Dall's just the one photo of the unknown which isn't great but the rest were for sure porpoises.-Robyn Daly
