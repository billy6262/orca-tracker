Orca Sightings for August 27, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
~

16:00 - J pod entered Active Pass
and travelled quickly eastward. Unfortunately, we were not at our usual whale watching spot but were able to see them from the Sturdies Bay ferry terminal as they hugged the Mayne island shore and then from the Gulf Islands ferry as it gave them a wide berth in
Georgia Strait
. The pod was very spread out, with some breaching and a lot of tail slapping. -Karoline Cullen, Salish Sea Orca Squad, Galiano Island

A big cartwheel from
J31 Tsuchi this morning

with her, she had
J53

about 11 whales over 2 hrs, from 9~11am.

08:25 - Haro Strait, SJI, J Pod
observed and photographed from shore between
Hannah Hts and Edwards Point: 10-14 orca
spaced out but moving as a group

Entry 5:
T137s -
Brad Hanson and Candice Emmons, NWFSC/NOAA were out with the T137s
August 27th, here are their observations: We spent a few hours
with the T137s starting about 1145 yesterday. T137A was alone
when we first arrived swimming slowly south. He only had a slight head lift when we arrived, but then his behavior suddenly changed. He stopped moving, the head lift became very pronounced, and he sunk down instead of normal diving. This was the case for over an hour.
His family group later came in from the south and joined him.
At this point his surfacing became more normal again and he could keep up with them. While we were there his respiration pattern seemed normal (2-3 breaths per surface interval) and he didn't take extra breaths when he was with the group. We couldn't detect an odor from his breath. The breaths seemed normal (no wheeze, forceful). His skin looks fairly normal other than some sloughing around his head and on the dorsal fin. Although we could not get a good look there appears to be a light colored area of skin at the base of the peduncle on the right side. We didn't see any foraging while we there. Unfortunately it was too windy to collect a breath sample. Similarly the 20 knots of wind precluded effective fecal sampling. After the whales joined up they milled for a while and then headed west towards Rich Passage.
We left them at 1515

Stephanie Raymond on Clipper called at

09:53
, says a passenger photo shows
99% sure T137s but no T137A off Indianola
headed south east at a good clip. They didn't look a mile or two behind them so maybe trailing again.
*

09:20 -
The mid channel blows off Richmond Beach are 1-2 humpbacks foraging back and forth. (turns out one probably was
T137A
, who was later picked up in that area lagging behind). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

09:10 -
I saw
both the humpback on the mainland side and the orcas off of Jefferson Head
from the 845 Kingston to Seattle fast ferry so it would have been at about
9:10. -Andrew Dempsey
*

08:55 -
I believe I've spotted the group. Several
blows south of Jefferson Head, out from Port Madison
, another further east more mid channel. The group looks SB in SB traffic lanes. Way too far to ID. Clipper just getting here hopefully they'll have IDs. (I was seeing blows of two animals closer to Richmond Beach, mid channel but several hundred yards apart,
one for sure humpback
). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

Entry 8:
9:15 -
Hi, We live just south of
Richmond Beach Saltwater Park
. There is
a whale about 200-300 yards off the beach
. We are not sure what type of whale but it appears to be alone so we're
thinking it is a humpback
. It blows about every 4-5 minutes. Hope all is well with this whale! -Debra Brown
*

09:30 -
I have been watching
1-2 humpbacks forage between Richmond Beach and Jefferson Head
since about 9am. (the other blow turned out to be T137A, see Bigg's section). -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

Entry 9:
Carr Inlet -

17:58 - Just saw two surface near Purdy
, headed out of the inlet. (we had no other orcas reported in south end, suggested they may have been the common dolphins - alb) They may have been (dolphins)....was hard to focus on them! -Keziah Brown
*
Tue Aug 27 - Here is the end of day Salish Sea orca summary for today (8/27). Every day for the last two weeks has looked similar!
T60D and T60E heading east from Dungeness Spit at
13:10
T34s, T37, and T37Bs heading south at Foulweather Bluff (Kitsap Peninsula) at
13:20
T36As heading north towards Point Roberts at
15:10
T10s and T109As milling at Race Rocks at
20:00
T137s heading out of Dyes Inlet at
21:00
J-Pod (no J16s or L87) heading south from Tsawwassen at
19:00
In addition, there have been many
dozens of humpback whales in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and scattered elsewhere in the Salish Sea, as well as minke whales, a gray whale, and porpoises, seals, sea lions, and even a couple sea otters. Wow!
We know as much as we do about the marine wildlife in the region because of the citizen scientists who both view from shore (that's most of you!) and those that work for the Pacific Whale Watch Association. The PWWA shares information with us as researchers at OBI and also with the general public; much of the information we share on this page comes from them, and their willingness to support shore-based whale-watching. In return, we also support responsible boat-based whale-watching. We say this just as a gentle reminder that this page is inclusive to everyone who loves these whales as a space to share information and our passion for all our marine mammal neighbors. (Believe it or not, we continue to have to remove negative comments about both boat-based and shore-based whale watchers!) Truly, we are all on the same side, as we all love seeing whales. As is evident from the above list of sightings, we are lucky to live in what is really still a pretty healthy marine ecosystem. Let's continue to work together both to share sightings and to ensure the future health of the Salish Sea. Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 10:
T137s
were well documented in last Whale Report -alb). Not the greatest video, but incredible to see. I've only lived here a year, but none of my neighbors recall seeing them around here for quite some time. We are right above the salmon pens and they were circling the rocks at high tide that are barely covered. Which pod are they part of, I wonder? t did appear to be a family and it was on the afternoon of
August 27th around

3:38 pm.
They continued up the shipping lane towards Pleasant Beach as far as I could see. -Regards, Frances Glass
