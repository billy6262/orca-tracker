Orca Sightings for August 5, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Posted Aug 5 - As we've now gone another five weeks and counting without Southern Residents in inland waters, you, like us, have probably been wondering where they've been. We've now heard from multiple sources that members off all three pods - and likely most or all members of all three pods - have been seen on several occasions over the last couple weeks out at Swifsture Bank, shown on the map below. So close and yet so far, right? The fact that they haven't come in to do their typical circuit to the Fraser gives us hope that they've found a steady source of food out there; otherwise, it seems to us that they would at least check out what for decades has been their mainstay summer food source.
Perhaps it makes sense for them to be out there, where they can encounter fish not only returning to the Fraser but to many other river systems both in Puget Sound and further south on the outer coast, including the Columbia-Snake River Basin. -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

Entry 3:
orca in Port Townsend bay
on Monday
August 5th at about

7:30 a.m.
He/she was incredibly close to shore, maybe only 30 feet away. No exaggeration! This was on the beach about 40 meters south of the rock groin at
Point Wilson lighthouse
. There was just the single animal and they arched out of the water apparently following a channel just offshore. Sorry I couldn't tell anything more to identify it as it was seen against the morning sunrise. -Thanks, John Downey

Would be

who were included in previous Whale Report -alb

Mon Aug 5 - Strait of Georgia - Last night (5th) I was on a whale watching trip to use up a pass I had...Here's a few photos of
humpbacks
I got! It was a beautiful evening to be in the water. I was out with Island Adventures from Anacortes but we found the humpbacks in Canadian waters just in the middle of the Strait just
south of Pt. Roberts area
. It was
between
6:00 and
7:30
approximately.
