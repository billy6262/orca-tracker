Orca Sightings for August 31, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Swiftsure Bank - K pod
- I had my boat on a fishing trip off Swiftsure bank on Saturday (8/31) and saw a pod of
10 or 12 orcas, in Canadian waters, a 1 - 2 miles to east of the bank
. The photos attached were taken with a 300 mm lens and cropped to enlarge. The dorsals in the first photo rise above the low swells that were out. Do they appear to be orcas of the coastal group? There were also a lot of humpbacks out there. (Follow up) Hi Alisa, let's see, my photo files show me the times they were taken,

11:20 to
11:30
....There is another photo I see where one of the orcas caught good light and a position above the swell. The background is Vancouver Island...We were traveling west that day. The pod appeared to be moving east, toward the Strait...I wouldn't be surprised if these salmon were salmon-feeding. I presumed so when I saw them in a place salmon fishermen frequent. We didn't have a hard time catching hatchery coho ourselves, along with one 13 (or so) lb chinook which was released. I've only just learned about a third group of orcas, the "offshore," which made me wonder if some of these are from this population. Glad to know these may be useful photos. -Thanks, Tim Roos

Entry 2:
Haro Strait - J pod -

18:30 -

19:40
- Observed from shore.
Between Hannah Hts and Edwards Point
, I observed
12 -14 orca
including 4 large males (3 for sure), and a calf - loosely grouped, spread out traveling to the N/NW. Dark clouds before dusk but
I believe I saw J39 Mako, J38 Cookie.
Just south of Edwards Point 2/3rds of the group turned heading back S/SE with part of that group also moving closer inland. The remaining 5-6 continued past Edwards Point, stalled awhile, U-turned, then followed the others southward. 3 breaches. 1 headstand. (Count might be off due to direction changes).

Saturday, 8/31: So happy to have met up with
J pod off False Bay
, San Juan Island, in the misty morning. At first they were spread out, moving south, then some milling around, and groups started getting together, doing a little fishing, a little breaching, etc. I think ALL of them were there, including
L87 Onyx
. Such a joy to see my dear J pod friends!!! Little
J56
is adorable!!! On the way back to Pt. Townsend, the sun came out and we found
humpback MMX0006
(around MacArther/Hein Bank) doing big circles of feeding, and h/she gave us a couple of very close passes and lovely fluke up tail dives. Very special day, thank you Puget Sound Express! -Bonnie Gretz

Hi there, Single
gray or humpback whale mid channel between Fort Casey and Port Townsend
on 8/31 around
7:30 PM. Multiple dives and blows. Long arched dives but no flukes showing so could not tell for sure if it was a gray or humpback from where I was. I hope some ferry riders had the opportunity to see it close up. What an amazing sight!! -D Campbell
