Wed Aug 14 - Strait of Juan de Fuca - Sharing this VIDEO to allow everyone to have a small window into what we experienced Today...with
12+ Transient Killer Whales first converging on a single Humpback Whale than shortly two more came to "rescue"?
We first had the pleasure to visit
4 Orca traveling at high speed SW of Jordan River
and as the only couple other boats departed we were quickly engulfed in dense fog....we lost our first group but could hear Humpback blows near by so we slowly headed that direction...All of a sudden we surrounded by Killer whales and Humpbacks everywhere! We shut down our boats and were blessed to witness what happened. We always follow regulations and with only our two boats on scene in thick fog we had an encounter of a life time. This does not happen, so please understand we did our best to be responsible for all whales involved and I truly believe we did not interfere in any way, we love what we do. Enjoy. -Paul Pudwell
