Orca Sightings for August 6, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Upper Straight of Georgia
- Hi, I don't know if you are aware, but today, we saw
a family of orca just off the shores of Savary island by the wharf
. So close to where boats are anchored and we could clearly see daddy with baby and the mom was farther away, slapping the water. We think to send signals of boats or danger nearby. They peacefully finished their feast and went around mace point and we saw them an hour or so later from our front deck on the south side going toward Comox. What a sight! I have video. But am emailing to advise. :). Everyone was respectfully distant and stopped traffic until they'd moved on. Including a likely startled kayaker! -Cheers, Jenn Gaiger

one baby Orca this morning around 10am-ish
just off of the
