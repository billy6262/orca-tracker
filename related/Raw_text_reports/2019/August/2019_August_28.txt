Orca Sightings for August 28, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
19:13 - Orca, now NB off Lagoon Point, appear to be feeding
again out of my sight. Saw them from my upstairs loft after my son called from beach. There were at least 3. (We asked if male was present): My view was very limited though and I was lucky to see them at all. I was not close enough for id either, or for pictures. -Patricia Prochaska
