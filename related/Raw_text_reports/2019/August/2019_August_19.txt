============================================================

Entry 1:
*

21:10 -
Somewhere top of island ealier they slowed way down. A lot of foraging for while before they made their way down, stalled a while
probably out from County Park & north of?
We could see a lot of breaches in the distance. They finally made it out from Lime Kiln after dark pretty far offshore, they streamed by spread out in 1-4s. It didn't look to be all of them, but they were so spread it's difficult to say. Tonight's was an exceptionally gorgeous sunset. Js finally passed the lighthouse after the sun went down, backdropped by sky cloaked in brilliant warm tones. Gayle and I ( and so many others) stayed on to listen to their exhalations in the waning light when we could no longer see their beings.

20:15 - From Lime Kiln been watching Js
far north for the past 30 minutes, some breaches. Few of the whales heading SWerly away from the island, including male. Currently there is a line of several whales coming southbound in the distance closer to the island. -Alisa Lermire Brooks, Orca Network

Mon Aug 19 - WA Coast - NORTHERN RESIDENTS - Greg Schorr sent us this message and link to the report and photos below, about Northern Residents off the WA Coast this week: While conducting a survey for SRKW out of La Push on
August 19th, researchers from MarEcoTel ran across
members of B and G pod
.
Northern Residents off the WA coast. On
August 19th researchers from MarEcoTel, in collaboration with Northwest Fisheries Science Center, conducted a survey
out of La Push, WA
to search for Southern Residents. Taking advantage of a gorgeous day on the water, the crew was surveying north
towards Swiftsure Bank
when they encountered the B1 pod of Northern Residents. In addition to lots of surface active behaviors, the whales were also associated with Dall's porpoise for a bit. A total of 7 fecal samples were collected for analysis. On the way back to the harbor, two members of G pod were also sighted. While we were disappointed not to find the Southern Residents, this was an interesting data point nonetheless!

Entry 4:
*
...
western coastline of Whidbey
this summer. We'd gotten word from a fellow whale watching captain that another species of whale had been found further to the north, so we left the gray to continue its feeding and cruised off in search of more whales. We were in for a treat. We arrived to find
at least sixteen Bigg's orcas
having an all-out T-Party, the
T36As, T36s, T37, and T99s amongst them!
