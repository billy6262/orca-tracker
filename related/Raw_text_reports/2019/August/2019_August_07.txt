Orca Sightings for August 7, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
T18 Esperanza and T19C Spouter this afternoon off Shaw Island
. Today was not the best day to be a harbor seal in the San Juan Islands! The T18s were making pit stops at nearly every seal haul out as we watched them this afternoon. Here's
T19B Galiano
with some very nervous harbor seals near Blind Island.

15:50 - Orcas westbound Harney Channel
(They did indeed go west through Harney Channel and Wasp Passage, and then north up San Juan Channel). -Monika Wieland Shields

14:40 -
So cool to get a text from my niece Leah McNabb with orca sighting report near real time & images included below: "
Just off Lopez and Shaw
. I was out at Friday Harbor today for work - making my way back - ferry (FH/Lopez/Anacortes run) was delayed thankfully so we got to see the orcas swim in front of the boat so we were there for about 20 minutes. People who do this run weekly for 30 years saw them for the first time." (
T18s

1 adult, 1 juvenile in Thatcher Pass today, 8/7/19 at
12:38 pm.
T19B (born 1995) traveling the islands.
They were traveling west and were very close to the
north shore of Decatur Island
. Taken with 400mm lens and cropped. We were about 200 yards away, heading west also. I am a bird photographer and had my camera with me. -Thanks, Eileen de la Cruz

Entry 2:

09:00
- When fishing on the 7th we had four or five Orcas swim by, two large ones and one younger one and we think one medium size. They were
coming from the Point No Point area
and stopped on the east, deep side of the the bar. They swam around in a circle for about 15 minutes the slowly swam north. The much smaller one kept very close to the adults. I will attach several pictures l took. To the
north of the orca is Bush Point
. I am sending you this info because in today's Kitsap Sun newspaper it stated the whales had not been sighted in Puget Sound for awhile. We did see them and hope they can find salmon, we didn't. -Don Williams
(
T137s
were in on 6th. We had no other reports of them on the 7th, but this looks probable to be them heading out after a night's stay - alb
