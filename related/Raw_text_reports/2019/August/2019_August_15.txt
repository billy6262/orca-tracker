We flew all the way from Ohio just to see the Orcas and were so lucky to find
Blackberry and J-Pod yesterday
(15th)! Thank you all for sharing your little slice of heaven with us. It was our first time as well and we didn't want to leave! The whole island is very passionate about the orcas and wildlife in general. We saw
orcas, a humpback, minkes
, 10 or so bald eagles, foxes, it goes on and on. Had an amazing time.

HI Alisa! Hi Howard and Susan! 8-15-19
Orcas in the fog, Haro Strait, SJI
. (Please help confirm Id's, I believe the pair was
J16 Slick and J19 Shachi
.) Observed from the shore.

10:45am -
11:25am
, in dense fog I heard a group of orca moving to the NN/W across
Hannah Hts towards Edward Point
. It sounded like they were very spread out and moving quickly. A smaller group stayed to the S across from Hannah Hts. (Close in to shore I noticed a larger than usual number of fish jumping).
11:29 am, moving to the SSE from Edwards Point to Hannah Hts. Traveling swiftly and closely together, 2 gorgeous orcas moved out of the fog through a patch of sunlight and then back into the fog. To see them like this with the fog and sparkling water was magnificent. (Photos enlargements attached) Thank you so much. -Michelline Halliday, SJI. -Photos by Michelline Halliday, Aug 15, 2019

Entry 10:
5pm off Point Robinson
today my friend and I were ringed by
porpoise
. They circled around us at a range of 20 yards or more. They were focused on feeding-apparently oblivious to us. We aren't sure how many there were but one looked really immature....We did not get any pics. As I look at photos online I think they were
Harbor porpoises
due to their consistent grey color. -Jeanne Marie Thomas

Not sure if you want
harbor porpoise
sightings or just larger cetaceans, but there are at least 2, looks like mom and calf, cruising
Alki beach
right now (
8:13am). They just passed the obelisk at 63rd ave. -Patrick Hutchins
