Entry 3:
*
...After visiting with him for a bit we moved on to
Haro Strait
where we encountered the
T46B's (including little gray whale T46B1B "T'Luk")
. There we saw something none of us had ever seen...transient orcas chasing pink salmon! Tearing them up and quite possibly eating them, not really sure! They were going to town, non stop action that had no end in sight! I heard later that the whale chatter on the hydrophone in the area was amazing! We actually heard a little bit of it while we were there! Incredible experience topped off with a colorful sunset on the way home! Photos taken with a telephoto lens, heavily zoomed and cropped for details. All whalewatch guidelines were followed. -Janine Harles

Just a few quickies from the
afternoon
tour with the
T46B's
...no they weren't on a traditional kill, instead they were terrorizing pink salmon!! The action was nonstop, they were jumping over each other, sharking, cartwheeling, it was amazing! None of us had ever seen anything quite like it! Not sure is they were actually eating them or just tearing them apart, but they were having a blast!! -Photos by Janine Harles, Aug 20, 2019
