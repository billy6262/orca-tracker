============================================================

Entry 1:
12:15 -

13:21- Haro Strait, SJI
, observed and photographed from shore
between Hannah Hts and Edwards Point
. Wind and waves,
12-14 orcas including 2-3 large males
, loosely grouped traveling to the N/NW. As they reached Edwards Point the group split into 3 groups; 4-5 continued north past
Edwards Point (group w/ J38 Cookie)
, 2-3 traveled far out due west then turned south, 5-6 U-turned heading back S/SE (
group w/ J27 Blackberry)
. The group with J27 was very tight together and stayed tight through surface behaviors; repetitive tail slapping, 3 breaches, spy hop, lunging, even what looked like "community bubble blowing". They milled about then loosened up resuming travel to the S/SE past Hannah Hts. The group with J38 Cookie appeared again at Edwards Point having doubled back. Observed spy hop, lunging behavior, tail slapping as they traveled following Blackberry's group past Hannah Hts. -Michelline Halliday, SJI

, observed and photographed from shore
between Hannah Hts and Edwards Point
: 11 breaches! Surface behavior included spy hops, tail slapping, a double-breach and just lounging at the surface. Hard to count but
10-14 orcas including 3 large males
, loosely grouped traveling to the N/NW. When they reached Edwards Point the group turned, slowed down, swam a little farther out and headed back to the south until out of sight past Hannah Hts.

We were out on Saratoga Passage today, a beautiful day, specially when whales were spotted just off
Harrington Lagoon, on the north end of Saratoga
. There were
4 of them, the T137s
, and being late in the afternoon the colors were wonderful. Here are just a few of the many photos taken ..... all images zoomed and cropped. (observations by Jill on
T137A: surfacing slowly each time
, but he was staying with the rest of his pod. If I had to describe his movements, would say he moved like he had a really bad headache (or some kind of ache).

Entry 12:
7am
this morning, I saw 2 small orcas breaching in Henderson Bay. They were in the middle, but you could see them shoot straight up out of the water and flop down, making a thump/splash. They were about 150 yards from each other. My phone didn't capture it very well, but hope to get a better photo tomorrow morning. -Judy Peterson (
with no other orca reports thinking they may be common dolphins - alb
