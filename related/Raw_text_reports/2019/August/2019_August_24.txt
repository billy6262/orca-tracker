Entry 2:
T137A Update
from Dr. Andrew Trites, Director of the Marine Mammal Research Unit, Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries: "We last saw him at

8:38am off False Bay
about 2.4 miles west heading slowly south-south-west at 2-3 knots, pretty well grouped up. He never came high out of the water to see his saddle patch, and was about 500 m behind the rest of the pod who were close together. We did not notice anything unusual about his behaviour and saw no obvious sign of peanut head. There appeared to be about 9 animals, but we haven't gone through pictures yet." -Kelley Balcomb-Bartok

Sat Aug 24 - While we are by no means an ecosystem without its share of problems, it is really pretty amazing that so much wildlife can live alongside what is such an urban area in the Salish Sea including cities like Seattle, Vancouver, and Victoria. Today alone there were
47 Bigg's killer whales in the Salish Sea
; the youngest of the bunch,
T34A1
at just a few months old, is pictured here in San Juan Channel.
There were also
more than 20 Southern Resident killer whales
, with word of J-Pod coming back into inland waters late this afternoon. On top of that, the Strait of Juan de Fuca has been teeming with
dozens of humpback whales
, and more scattered throughout the rest of the region. That's to say nothing of the many hundreds of harbor seals weaning pups, the dozens of Steller sea lions returning from their summer breeding grounds, the elusive minke whales and harbor porpoise, or the thousands of sea birds! Sometimes we, with reason, feel down about all the damage being done to our waters, but it's worth also taking a moment to recognize what in many ways is still a thriving marine ecosystem. If we can find a way to restore salmon runs, one might even venture to call it a healthy ecosystem, despite the seven million people living along its shores. -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 3:
13:15 - Orca - Haro Strait, SJI
. Heading to the north and just approaching
Edwards Point I observed 2 (3?) transients
racing together up island. The male had a bent or crooked fin. Almost too far away to photograph, I am sending a very enlarged photo.

12:30 - Orca northbound in Haro Strait off Hannah Heights
far out in the South shipping lane, a small group of orcas barely seen with binocs, moving to the N or NW. -Michelline Halliday

On Saturday we found the
T46Bs south of San Juan Island
- always fun to see these 5 whales (the
46B1s were further north
). They appeared to be hunting but no visible signs of "what was for lunch". Lots of Steller sea lions by
Whale Rock (Just off Lopez Island - between Lopez and San Juan Island.)
, one Tufted Puffin, and 3 Humpbacks on our return trip, but not enough good visuals to identify them. A wonderfully calm day, even though it was overcast and at times a little misty. Thank you Puget Sound Express. -Jill Hein
