It was along the
southeastern Vancouver Island coastline, west of Victoria city, that we met up with a lone Bigg's Killer Whale.
It turned out to be
T65A2
, going it solo. This fifteen-year-old male is typically seen traveling with his mom and four siblings, but as of this week, he's been spotted on his own several times. It will be interesting to see when/if he meets back up with mom and joins the pod once again. He seemed to be having a good time this morning. Right as we arrived on the scene, we were wowed by two full breaches and a dramatic tail slap. After this impressive display of strength, he proceeded to scout out the kelp beds along the shoreline, possibly looking for prey...Sam Murphy, Island Adventures

With reports of the
T46s and T46Bs (including the light-colored calf T46B1B) heading south in Admiralty Inlet
, we caught up with the whales at
Lagoon Point mid-afternoon
. They didn't seem to be in any hurry as they milled and circled for a while, and THINK (from a rather long and slightly distorted shot) that they had a harbor porpoise in their grasp at one point. After having some fun porpoising the wake of a Navy freighter (alas, the camera didn't do this activity justice), they continued south with rather more purpose passing Bush Point in the early evening. As the orcas were exhaling plumes of vapor creating exquisite back-lit blows, dedicated Orca-Dorks were drawing breath at the sheer beauty before them. (Photos Richard Snowberger). -Sandra Pollard

, believed to be
#2253
. Beautiful water conditions on Friday 9th. - Jill Hein
*

Entry 7:
at least four different minkes whales near Hein bank
. The first couple that we came across were living up to the nickname "slinky minkes", but the next group, well, they were downright curious. As we approached the scene, one of the minkes we'd spotted did a full 180 to beeline for the boat. We watched with eager anticipation as it swam closer and closer. Then, all of a sudden it was right next to us! We were quite literally staring down the blowholes of the whale as it gave us as close of a pass as a minke could...Sam Murphy, Island Adventures
