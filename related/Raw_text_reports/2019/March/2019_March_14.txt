Orca Sightings for March 14, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
"Orcinus" arrived on scene around 1220 where the
T10s and the T2Cs, minus T2C2 and T2C3
, were traveling slowly north tight to the east shoreline of
Moresby Island
. Several whales from this group stopped and briefly logged at the surface. After a long dive, the whales moved more into the middle of lower Swanson Channel and began to wake up a bit. T10 did two big cartwheels and T2C did one. A whale appeared from the north and this turned out to be
T2C3
. T2C3 logged briefly at the surface about a quarter of a mile north of the other whales when all the whales went on another long dive. When the whales came up again, T2C3 had re-joined the group and everybody continued north. -Full summary report/photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 16

Entry 3:
18:40 - Lone orca observed from of Point No Point, between PnP and Double Bluff
. Mid-channel, moving westward in straight line.
6:40 PM on Thursday 3/14. Tall straight dorsal fin. Too far away to note any other features, even with binoculars. I thought it was odd because I've never seen "just one" orca....he was heading out Admiralty. -Van Bergen

Apple tree point....North of Kingston

Northbound orcas

T137B and mom T137, big boys T46D and T137A, T46E (r) and others. Found T46's and T137's at Dilworth Beach
this afternoon. We got a very surprising close pass by the big boy
T49C
(pictured). He scared the crap out of a couple guys out fishing when he surfaced out of no where right next to their small boat. -Kelly Keenan

Several of us stayed and watched the Ts for hours as they finished their meal and the sun warmed the atmosphere. The Ts have now finished their meal and are heading northbound, grouped up with several porpoising at high speed! Groups are mid channel and east of still

. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

This was the best I could do from
Three Tree Point
today...had to zoom way in lol. Anyhow, great fun seeing them even that far away. -Photo by Brian Nygren, Mar 14, 2019

Orcas were active on a kill it looked like just north of KVI for quite a while. I left around
1pm. From Point Robinson

Entry 4:
*

12:46 -
Update and ID confirmation from Bart Rulon:
Saratoga has T46s and T137s
on a kill a few miles north of
Robinson point Vashon
Island milling
*

12:28 - orcas
still breaching, spyhopping, diving etc off of
KVI (beach, mid Vashon)
. Lots of circling birds. -Jake Conroy
*

12:12 -
pod that had split north previously have returned South again and rejoined. They are now all spread out still
North of KVI (Point Heyer on Vashon)
close to the Vashon shore, and have stalled. Looks like lots of predation activity.

11:40 -
pods have split some headed north hugging the Vashon shore nearing
Dilworth
, some just north of KVI, milling south but not committed direction yet. -Marla Smith
*

11:00 - Approx 8-10 orcas (2-3 bulls)
have drifted a little bit south (of
10:30 report) with their meal, spread out. Presuming larger prey (like sea lion) since spread apart and dozens of gulls swooping in for scraps at every location. Orcas are staying around for the time being. Still a lot of surface activity: breaches, lazy tail lobs and logging for extended periods!

10:30 -
Definitely on a hunt, a lot of surface activity (breaches, lunges, directional changes, tail throws, etc) At least 2 bulls, so probably two groups.

10:25 -
just spotted them again, same place as
10:15 (
between S side Three Tree Pt, Burien and Tramp Harbor, Vashon
) looks like orcas may have stalled, maybe on hunt/meal. Lots of directional changes and no forward progress.

10:15 - orcas are south side of Three Tree Point,
Burien mid channel heading southbound. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

08:30 -
Kelly Keenan relayed a report of
orcas (3-4 with one big male) off Fauntleroy Ferry dock (West Seattle) heading southbound.
*

Entry 5:
12:39 - 5 unidentified orca off Sandheads
, mouth of the main river. They made a drastic course alteration and moving fast towards the jetty, likely on a kill. Lots of rock sausage and a few stellar chilling on the jetty. -Scott MacLeod

Entry 6:
13:00 -
Hello, Wife and I Spotted
3-4 Orcas off Lighthouse Point on Mayne Island
. They were heading west between Mayne and Galiano Islands. Sighting was at approximately 1pm from the 12pm Swartz Bay - Twawwassen Ferry. Another smaller boat was on course to intersect their path, but that boat was seen to stop and turn off its engines once they saw the Orcas. We were only able to get this clear photo of one of the Orcas. I have attached the photo. If there are any other reports of which Orcas these may have been, we would appreciate that information. -Regards, Cody Tornow
