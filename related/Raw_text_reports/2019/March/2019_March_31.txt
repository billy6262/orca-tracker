"These calves are among the ~40 critically endangered Southern Resident orcas that we are watching today! They are
32-year-old L77 Matia (open saddle, often seen in these salmon-eating resident orcas) with her 3 month old newborn L124
...and 24-year-old
L91 Muncher
with her
4-year-old son L122 Magic
.So fantastic to see these very active young calves: hope they feast on salmon! Our crew were first to spot them, over two miles away through binocs." -Photos by guest Nicene Shimotomai, and our naturalist Kara Hall, Mar 31, 2019

11:30 -
ORCA ALERT (updated!) Southern Residents in Monterey Bay, right now! Our vessel Blackfin is on a very rare encounter with over 40
critically endangered Southern Resident killer whales, including adult female L72 Racer
, pictured below! Our Capt. Scott Charlan spotted them first, from over two miles away (through binocs): very active, with lots of breaching! Our Marine Biologist/MBWW owner, killer whale researcher Nancy Black, was the first to encounter and identify them here in
January 2000; we have not seen them here since 2011! Photo: naturalist Kara Hall: More later! -Monterey Bay Whale Watch

"We found and identified the
Southern Resident Killer Whales in Monterey Bay
today!! and observed them possibly feeding later in the day. They had been traveling in a tight group for a while and then spread out and milled over a mile plus area in mostly singles. We saw one whale circle and leave a distinct small slick in the water. We also found the new calf,
L124
that was born in December and good news the calf is still alive! Many people have been asking us that. Kara Hall our naturalist on the Blackfin this morning noticed right away that some Killer Whales had open saddles and they were not our regular transients. She sent the photo to me right away at
10:30 am. I called Ken Balcomb of Center for Whale Research to alert him and Alisa Schulman-Janiger had the latest guide book from up north to ID a few whales from a shot taken from back of Kara's camera They quickly were confirmed as L Pod. Shortly after we confirmed the new calf From a photo taken by Nicene Shimotomai, with Tomoko Shimotomai, was still with them by sending the screen shot of mom and baby directly to Ken Balcomb. We hope they are finding salmon to eat here and stay safe as they are foraging all around many crab traps in Monterey Bay. I first sighted L and part of K pod in 2000, 19 years ago and have identified them just a few other times, the last time we saw them was 2011 in Monterey Bay although they are known to travel down the west coast in the winter searching for salmon."

These endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales were last in Monterey Bay in 2011, and our Captain Kate saw them then too. Today's sighting of
over 30 of them
, traveling northward, was a rare and exciting treat. The newest calf, L-124, is alive and thriving! These salmon hunters are the subject of intense concern in their home waters of the Salish Sea, where it's clear that their numbers are dwindling in large part due to lack of large wild Chinook (king) salmon to eat. We hope they are finding California Chinook salmon on this apparent foraging journey. The clothing company Patagonia has funded a new film that faces the solution for both wild salmon and these orcas that depend on them: tearing down river dams, and reducing farmed salmon. Watch the trailer, learn more, and take action here: https://www.patagonia.com/artifishal.html Read about an earlier 2008 sighting, on a very rough windy January day back when our Captain Kate was a naturalist with another company: https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Puget-Sound-orcas-feeding-in-California-again-1262889.php We expect more sightings of California transient/Bigg's killer whales, the mammal hunters, in April and May.

OTHER SPECIES - Sun Mar 31 - Hi Alisa and folks at the Orca Network, Fun day on Whidbey today. Started off at sunrise (really fogged in) at Hidden Drive Parking Lot where I saw a family of 3 otters, then Langley Lookout at around 9am when we started to see
2-3 Gray Whales on the South end of Camano Island heading South
. I then went to Possession Point State Park where I was treated by 2 Harbor Porpoises about 25 yards off the shore. Enjoy the pictures. Sorry the Gray Whales pictures weren't better, they were pretty far away even with my 500mm. -David Haeckel

humpback southbound close to west shore 3.31 at 1120. Apx 1 mile
