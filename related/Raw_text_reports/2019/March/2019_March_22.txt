Orca Sightings for March 22, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Great news.
J17 is alive and has even improved a little in body condition
since December/January. However, her breath smells awful so the CWR will remain cautiously optimistic that she will survive. "At about
1132, whale watching boats found J pod southbound in northern Haro Strait
. Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1230 aboard "Orcinus". At 1240, "Orcinus" arrived on scene
about two miles southeast of Mandarte Island. J pod was very spread out in small groups and still slowly heading south....

11:46 - 6 grays east of Gedney #22, #383, 185, 53, 49 and possibly 2246
...What an amazing day! We found 6 gray whales East of Gedney Island today! #49, #53, #185, #383, #22 and what looked like #2246! We shut off the engines with Chilkat across from us doing the same and we floated with 6 grays surrounding us! On the way home, we stopped and checked out the Steller Sea Lions on the navigational marker at Possession and then found
#44 Dubnuck
not far from there! 7 Grays! On a side note, we also saw a Rhino Auklet and Brandt's Cormorants!
2018 Newbie to the NP Sounders: PCFG CRC 185 off Hat/Gedeny Island.

Brighter than bright sunshine on the water today made for challenging photographic situations and IDs, BUT, when all was said and done, we counted at least 6 gray whales surrounding us out there. It was literally WHALE SOUP!!
#22
made a momentary appearance just before we left,
#53
was anything but shy today,
#49
headed straight for us a few times,
#383
who, of course fluked the best of all,
#185
hung out at the surface doing who knows what and another further off who we could not confirm (possibly #2246) and THEN on our return trip, Chilkat alerted us to another gray at Possession which happened to be
#44
. -Renee Beitzel

We had
a whale
hanging out just off
Jetty Island this morning around 8am
. He was there for well over an hour. We could see him from our office on the waterfront. I have video but cant get it to load. He would come up out of the water just far enough to blow and then back down. -Sandra Volkert-Honeycutt
