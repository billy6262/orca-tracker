Entry 3:
S Saratoga Pas
s - After seeing at least 4 whale watch boats stop, then leave, just south of my house, I was able to spot the
2 gray whales feeding on the ghost shrimp beds
in VERY shallow water. By the timing and location, I assume they were #21 & #22 as reported earlier by Jill Hein. One was much lighter color. After all the commericial boats left, the whales spent a long, leisurely, time feeding in very close proximity to each other and moving slowly north to Mabana. The calm water and sun reflecting off the whales made for some absolutely beautiful whale watching. You could see them below the water, then barely breaking the surface and hardly blowing. -Barbara Brock

A few photos from Friday of
gray whales in Saratoga Passage. #21 Shackelton and #22 Earhart
were feeding along the shore just
south of Pebble Beach, Camano
, and
#723 Lucyfer and friend (s) were spotted mid-channel between Pebble Beach and Langley
, heading south-westerly towards the Delta. We also spotted many Brant geese - spring migrants in the area, getting ready to head to Alaska and beyond for breeding season. -Jill Hein

Today was my first day ever working on the Glacier Spirit out of Langley. It was a really fun trip and the wildlife was quite cooperative! Just moments after I announced what to look for passengers shouted "A blow! Three o' clock!" Sure enough, we found
Gray Whales #21 Shackleton and #22 Earheart feeding in the shallow waters near Camano Island right across from Langley.
They were accompanied by a Harbor Seal and a number of birds. Later we spotted
two more Gray Whales out in the deeper part of Saratoga Passage
along with some Harbor Porpoises. While we never managed to ID the third whale, we were happy to see the fourth was none other than
#723 Lucyfer
! As far as I'm aware, today was the first day this fan favorite was seen back in Puget Sound this year. -Justine Buckmaster

12:40 -
Jill Hein aboard Glacier Spirit called LWC to report:
Grays 21 & 22 feeding near the shore of Camano
across,
slightly south of Pebble Beach
, back and forth. Also
gray whale 723 and 1 or 2 others midway between Camano and Whidbey
southbound trending towards Evetett. Total of 5 on the trip. This would be
first confirmed sigting of 723 and 21
.

08:45 - I saw minkes in
Holmes Harbor
this morning. Maybe 3 or 4 of them? by Freeland Park....Yes, a friend told me they were
actually harbor porpoise. 4 of them!
They were about the size of a super large salmon, with rounded dorsal fins that were angled. -Elizabeth Steele
