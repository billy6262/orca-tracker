Saw a beautiful pod of
orcas on the
9:00 Clinton-Mukilteo
run this morning! They are heading towards Whidbey it looks like. I counted 5!...I was going towards Mukilteo and they were on the port side of the boat. Looked to be heading towards the Clinton dock or further north. -Shanna Barrett Dumke

UNCONFIRMED SPECIES - Mon Mar 4 - Just got this text from my coworker this morning (She was commuting to Pt Townsend over the bridge so I'm sure she saw them from the car while driving. She has a science background I think powers of observation would exclude little harbor porps. But dolphins or otherwise unobserved orcas are a possibility!): "At
7:53am there was
a pod of whales just north (less than 500 yards) of the hood canal bridge
, just before midspan. I saw five dorsal fins. I am guessing pilot whale, but ? and I couldn't stop." -Donna Green van Renselaar

UNCONFIRMED: GRAY OR HUMPBACK - Mon Mar 4 - Saw one (reported in gray whale post - alb) Monday morning at about

9:45 am off of Three Tree Point (Burien)
. Saw the blow and waited for it to come up. Tide was high so it was in close, spectacular!...headed north to go around the point. Just off the public beach on the south side of Three Tree Point. Also known as Point Pully on navigation maps. Could have been a humpy..thought that's what it was at first. Quick look before it rolled back in. -Alfred E. Newman
