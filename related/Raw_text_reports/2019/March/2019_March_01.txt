Orca Sightings for March 1, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
2 whales between Everett and Hat Island. 2 days ago there were 4 again, same area
. Yesterday (
March 1) there appeared to be many more than 4. If I had guess, somewhere between 6 and 10....It's possible there were only 4 yesterday. They were very active blowing and surfacing in the same general area I have not seen that kind of behavior before. I've attached the best pics from the other day. Not very reveling. Hope they are of some use....I'm not sure when they arrived in the area. I spotted them in the early evening,
6:00ish.They were southwest of Hat Island in deeper water several hundred yards south of "the dolphin". I'm making an assumption you know what "the dolphin" is. (wood tepee looking structure on the edge of the delta,west of the southern tip of Hat Island). Have you heard of any other migrating grays arriving to PS this year? -Jim Quintel

Entry 2:
UNIDENTIFIED KILLER WHALES - (
presumably Bigg's
T46s
who showed up in Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage early morning

Entry 3:
15:00 - A likely Bottlenose dolphin just went by, close to shore off Apple Tree Point (Kingston)) going NB
. Neighbor thinks he saw it yesterday too. Was moving fast. No pics. -Sara Frey
