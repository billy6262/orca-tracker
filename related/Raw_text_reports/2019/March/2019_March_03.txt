Orca Sightings for March 3, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's March, and it's no surprise that sightings of mammal-eating transient/Bigg's killer whales are beginning to pick up! We had a double-header today encountering the
T46s in Saratoga Passage and then the T90s and T101s heading into Cattle Pass
on the way home. Pictured here are
T101 and T101B
under Mt. Baker with
Lopez Island

18:00 - a little after 6pm, they had angled over towards Camano Head
, could not tell if they were still heading south, or east or even possibly north up Port Susan? they were defintiley on long down times, at times up to 10 minutes. Lost track of them after this point...

Sun Mar 3...The
T46s
are such a cool family for many reasons. One is that T46 Wake was part of the last killer whale capture in Washington State in 1976. She was released and is still plying the same waters as one of the most successful mothers on record. As we discussed on the boat while we were on scene, if she had been taken into captivity as many other whales were in the 1960s and 70s, there would be nearly 20 fewer transient killer whales in the region, because that's how many living descendants she has...Monika Wieland Shield
