There were
at least 11 different transient/Bigg's killer whale matrilines in the area
, and one of them (the
T36As
, pictured in this photo by sara Hysong-Shimazu, had a brand new calf with them! As Sara said: it's amazing what ample food will do for a population. There have been at least three births into this booming population in 2019 alone. A new phrase is catching on in the Salish Sea: "Biggs are the balance". While fishermen are illegally shooting seals and sea lions on both sides of the border over perceived competition for fish, these expert predators are a far more effective, efficient, and natural population control. -Monika Wieland Shields

The Bigg's baby boom continues. Amazing what ample food will do for a population.

Sunset at
Long Point with 44 and 56

Warm sunshine and
gray whales #44 and #56 in Penn Cove
for nearly 3 hours today. They were right off Highway 20 and caused quite a commotion. I loved the way their blows lit up, the way they sounded, and even caught a couple of whiffs of stinky gray whale breath! Beautiful day. -Rachel Haight

I was thrilled to find my favorite gray whale
#44 Dubknuck tonight in Penn Cove
!! He was
traveling/feeding with #56 right beside Hwy 20/Juan de Fuca

Entry 7:
2:30
today I was walking on the beach near my home in
Port Madison on Bainbridge Island
and heard a loud exhale and looked to the water and saw air and water spraying up from the back of what
I believe was a gray whale
. It's back was barnacled and it was mottled gray, looked defined, maybe skinny. It was moving very slowly from in the channel of Madison bay out to open water. I did not have my phone on me to take a photo unfortunately, but watched it for some time as it slowly made its way north. My neighbor saw it too. He says he recalled seeing a gray whale about 20 years ago in the bay, but never since. -Thank you, Piper Thornburgh
