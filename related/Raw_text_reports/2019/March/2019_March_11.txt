Orca Sightings for March 11, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
at least four orcas from Fort Worden in Port Townsend. Orcas entering Admirlty Wilson off Point Wilson.
. I watched from the bluff as they came around from the straight towards the bay. At one point, they were quite close to the shore near the lighthouse. Here's the best photo I got. Just amazing. Brought me to tears. This was the first time I've ever seen orcas in our waters in my 28 years of living on the sound. Thanks for all you do! Any idea of which pod this might have been? -Alexis Arrabito

Sat Mar 9...Dave and Melisa headed to Snug Harbor and left the dock at 1430 aboard "Orcinus". At
1503
, "Orcinus" arrived on scene with the
T123s and T124As off of Foster Point, near the east entrance of Harney Channel
. The whales were all grouped up and zig-zagging their way toward Obstruction Pass. Surfacing
beside T124A3 was a new calf
, likely born at the beginning of 2019. T123's calf that was born in late 2018 was also present....Full encounter report/photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 14.

Mon Mar 11 - Today was a bit colder and more overcast than the past few days, but sighting conditions were still fair and we encountered
3 Gray Whales. SE of Hat/Gedney Island were #49 Patch and #53 Little Patch
. Later we continued north into Saratoga Passage to see if we can spot any of the other Grays in the area. We found
#383 in Elger Bay
heading south. Despite the clouds, the mountains were still showing including Mt. Rainier making for some nice photo opportunities. -Justine Buckmaster
