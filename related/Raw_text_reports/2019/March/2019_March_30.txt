Orca Sightings for March 30, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
J Pod and Active Pass
. It felt a little bit like the good ol' days. The
J16s and J19s
arrived at the mouth of the pass first, and waited patiently for the rest of the whales to catch up before they all made their way through the pass together, just as J2 used to do. -Stunning VIDEO by Tasli Shaw
*
J19 "Shachi"
spyhopping (see image below) on the
south side of Active Pass
as she, her family and the J16s waited patiently for the rest of
J Pod
to catch up before entering the pass. The moments while they waited were absolutely incredible. Watching them lay almost motionless at the surface looking at one another, touching, rubbing and playing is one of those moments that remind of you of how lucky you are to spend time with such an incredible sentient being and how important it is to do everything you can do to protect them. J 19 spyhops in Active Pass while waiting for the rest of
J pod. J27, J41, J40, J19 and J36.

Very rare event today on the
west side of San Juan Island: southern resident killer whales
surfed up Haro Strait on a rare oceanographic phenomenon called an undulatory tidal bore! We heard a couple S4 calls over the ship noise before the whales surfed over the northern horizon...Orcasound - Listen for Whales FB page
