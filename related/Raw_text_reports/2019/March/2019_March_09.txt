These notes from the sighting last Saturday at Deep Bay from Jessica Torode-Scott: Hi Deborah, "I thought I would share some more info with you about inshore
Risso's
! I spoke with one of my colleagues, who told me that there was a lone Risso's spotted almost exactly 4 years ago near Salt Spring. At the time, we didn't have any confirmed sightings of Risso's in inside waters in our database, but Dr. John Ford said that there have been confirmed records in the past including a group of about 10 Risso's seen on four occasions in the Strait of Georgia in the summer of 1978. Plus there's quite a few stranding records from inside waters. The
Risso's near Saltpring
never stranded to our knowledge, just hung around for a few days...and was mistaken for a sick killer whale and a shark. Her reply to my question of why do they think it was there..."Honestly we aren't really sure...it's a mystery! Hopefully we will have some more sightings so that we can track its whereabouts and behaviour. Feel free to share on Facebook! "You can contribute to research and conservation by reporting your whale, dolphin, porpoise, and sea turtle sightings to the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network. Download the WhaleReport app, visit their website at wildwhales.org, email sightings@ocean.org, or call 1-866-I SAW ONE." So please share away...Deborah Freeman
