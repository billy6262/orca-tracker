Orca Sightings for March 25, 2019
============================================================

Entry 1:
Admiralty Inlet
- Large group of incoming
Transients

18:05 -

19:10 -
6:05P
report. Read orca pod heading towards Hansville - south of Light House saw huge white water out there 300 meters+. Two minutes later another huge white water high in the air. Starting running towards it - heading 1/2 mile down beach. Then I saw them -
Orca pod
out about, guesstimate 275 meters to 400 meters - 6 harbor seals were 5 meters off shore. The pod then started diving and swimming south - I ran with them for 2 to 2.5 miles south of Point No Point. Viewed them for 1 hour - unreal!!! (3rd experience) They stayed down underwater for around 3 to 4 minutes. Couldn't identify exact number -
minimum of 3 ... to 6 in pod
. They were diving. Appear at different times. One or Two in pod / males bringing up rear of pod. Pod then stopped / paused for about 6 to 10 minutes /
2 to 2.5 miles south of Point No Point
. Started swimming back North very briefly - stayed in deep water. 5 to 6 harbor seals 5 to 10 meters around me - 2 mile south of Point No Point. One piece that surprised me - often the seals would swim in same direction of Orca Pod swimming / deep diving heading south. I figured seals would get all the way up on shore and or swim opposite direction / North. New at this (seals always stayed 5 to 10 meters off shore) - guessing seals knew orcas were a solid 300 to 450 meters out. Seals were monitoring them ... and or orcas had one of their friends for dinner / earlier during all of the high in the air white water breaching. Unreal x 10 ... again 5 different times breaching (my first breaching experience!!) Does Orca Network have idea of which pod or pods this was? T137s? T46s? Another pod (read something about 86A)? Strongly sense it was the pod that came across from Whidbey Island / Mutiny Bay area folks posted about! Grand experience #3 !!!! -Andrew Muehling

17:00 -
whistles on
Bush Pt hydrophone
between
4:30 and 5 ish ...accountant had just stopped by to talk tax stuff so we watched them for a few minutes...couldn't give it my full attention...two or three times we both heard what sounded more like dolphin whistles on the Bush Pt Hps - just single whistles, maybe 10 minutes apart? I had heard one, then awhile she said she heard one, and I may have head another - this is when the Ts were out front of us, maybe a little bit south, so ~1 mile from the Hp. It looked like they were on a kill but I coulnd't tell what - I know Howie got a lot of photos as well. Anyway, wanted to report that possible "hearing" today, that I forgot about earlier! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Look to be 15+ transients. Passing bush Pt now (Looks like it's possibly the big group that came down from Nanaimo yesterday
T86A3
was in her photo and looked like T124A3s new kiddo. -SH-S) (Yesterday's group coming south was
T18s, T86As, T124As, and T124Ds - 16 whales
I think? Will be interesting to hear if they are all still together! MWS) -Rachel Haight

Orcas!! I went to Point Wilson Lighthouse
after work on a whim. And while I was watching a cormorant hanging out with 2 seals in the water, I heard something familiar. I heard an Orca exhale. I saw a boat in the distance, closer to Whidbey Island's shore, and a few Orcas surface in front of it. I snapped off a few shots (12) and sprinted to the car with the intention of racing (not literally) to Point Hudson for a potential better view. Lucky for Shannon I'm an awesome husband, and had the foresight to swing by and pick her up...So we headed down there together amd she was able to catch a few glimpses through my camera, before they slipped out of sight. These shots were from Point Wilson where they were much closer. -Sam Black Photography IG

T46s and T137s

T137A and T46E
pushing more west. I can't tell if they'll head south or change up and go to Admiralty. I'm leaving now.

did NOT follow Whidbey shore. Headed due south now. Southeast of Possession marker. East side, midchannel

Northmost group appears to be on a kill. Middle group is
T137A &T46E. T46D
still far south.

14:41- viewing from Glendale.
Orcas spread into 3 groups. One group turned around, northbound. Second group south of them but also turned north but not moving in a hurry. Then you have
T46D
alone southbound at Glendale. Very spread out and we can no longer see northmost group. -Rachel Haight
*
...it's been another 'whale of a day' with the
T46s and T137s.
Not only that, but after the T46s and T137s honored us with a close encounter at
Glendale
there was just enough time to get over to
Bush Point as a large pod of transient orcas (around 15)
, to include various matrilines, breezed past. Too quick for good photographs, but no matter, it was yet another inspiring sight of power, speed and sheer magnificence. -Sandra Pollard
