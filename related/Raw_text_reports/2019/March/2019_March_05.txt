We found whales quite early on in our trip, which meant we had ample time to visit with them. It turned out to be three grays:
Patch, Little Patch, and CRC-185.
...On the return trip home we found that a fourth gray whale had joined the fray. It turned out to be
CRC-2246

Entry 2:
12:00 - Our Bottlenose
friend? Came by at
12:00 pm today. Was sort of playing around and going back and forth. It is really hard to capture as fast as it comes up....She looked like maybe some feeding activity? A bit of splashing, direction changes, etc. Last times I saw the
dolphin
it was traveling fast. -Photos by Sara Frey
(
ID notes by Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research: "That is definitely a bottlenose, and probably Stump, but it isn't clear enough to be certain of the ID"
.)
