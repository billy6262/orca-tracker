Entry 1:

Reported by:
Sharyn Mellors
Location:
Admiralty Inlet, Whidbey Island
Species:
Orca
Pod:
Transient
Members:
3 - 4 orcas
Direction:
south
Comments:
Dear Susan, I am new at this so I was unable to count them or tell you what pod. But there are what appear to be orcas in admirals cove about a third of the way between ledgewood beach and the Point Wilson light house (
4:20 pm). There seemed to be at least 3 or 4. I saw the last one at
5:05pm. The last time I saw any they were heading south. I have trees that keep me from seeing much in that direction. They seemed to stay in the same general area for most of the time I was watching. They were going in all directions. Maybe they were playing or perhaps eating but they were not traveling. I saw black fins going up and then down in the water in an arc. There seemed to be a couple of different sizes and I was able to count 3 or 4 fins that didn't seem to be attached to each other. I was using a telescope so I had a limited field of view at any one time. I hope that this information helps. Sharyn Mellors Ledgewood beach
