12:00 Hello All; Fantastic sighting of approx. 8 Orcas off Brook's Point - South Pender Island. 15-20' from shore. Heading from West to East towards Saturna Island. 2-3 Orcas were also about .5 mile off shore handing around with the boats. There were many pleasure and whale watching boats, and they seemed to keep a respectable distance. Regards Derek

We had K and L pods (and maybe J) going north by Andrews Bay at
8:15 this morning. (Yup, it was all of them - the same ones that passed Ctr. for Whale Research). All I got for now. Rowann, The Whale Museum

August 16th: This time it's ME reporting from San Juan Island -All three pods passed right in front of the Center for Whale Research (west side of San Juan Island) this morning from about 8 - 9 a.m. The L-12 sub-pod lagged behind, but all the rest came through together - lots of lob-tailing, cartwheels, some breaches, & LOTS of chattering amongst the pods!!!! They were generally headed north, with lots of milling about. It was great to hear & watch them in person for a change, instead of just passing on other peoples' sightings! We also saw whales off the west side of San Juan Island, heading south, this afternoon on our way back from town, but haven't yet confirmed which pods were there. Susan Berta
