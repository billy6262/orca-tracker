In the afternoon, from Lopez Village we could see a large pod of orcas in the distance, southwest of us, in San Juan Channel. Unfortunately, they appeared to be surrounded by at least a dozen whale watching boats that seemed to be crowding them against the distant shore. Since they were so far out from us and our view was obstructed by the boats, we can't be more specific with numbers or identities. Sorry this report is late, but we just got back home to our computer! Hope you are having a whale of a summer! Deborah Houseworth

Hi Most if not all whales went West this morning, fog was a major player. Had reports of all the males except J1 but had Jpod whales myself. No other whales in the afternoon. Ron Bates MMRG, Victoria
