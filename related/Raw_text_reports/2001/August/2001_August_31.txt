Hi Susan, I just got off the phone with the folks at Great Pacific Adventures. It seems that two of their drivers have seen L-12 (Alexis) with a 6-12 inch gash on her right side just below her saddle patch. The gash is healing. I had a private boater report that he saw a female orca on 8/5 with a 10 in gash on her left side just below her saddle patch. The gash appeared fresh. Just passing this info along to see if we have the same whale both times. Any one else got some info? Thanks Rowann
