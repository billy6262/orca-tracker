Comment:
These guys seem to be doing the round-the-islands shuffle lately - we had a big group off west side of Lummi Island today around
11:00 a.m. moving south pretty fast towards Rosario Strait - they were spread far out all across the strait - from in close to Lummi to east side of Orcas - looked like maybe J's and L's (maybe some K's?) - 2 big males and one looked like J1 from a distance. I'll be looking out for them Thursday..... Penny Stone
