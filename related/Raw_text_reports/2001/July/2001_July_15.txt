Hi there, Today at 4.14pm I was standing at the rails at the Mizen Head, the most south westerly point of Ireland and I spotted what I thought were dolphins approaching along the west coast. As they got closer I noticed that their movement was too lazy to be that of a dolphin. as they surfaced I recognized them as killer whales. One came up out of the water enough to let me see the distinctive black and white markings. I counted seven, a group of four and seconds later several hundred yards away a further three. They seemed to hang about near the Headland and I would guess that there were actually a lot more than seven judging by the distance between individual surfacing. I know there were 3 whales in Cork harbour lately and reported sightings several miles out to sea, but I'm wondering if there may be organisations interested in my sighting, or is it of any research value. Regards, Paul Dee.
