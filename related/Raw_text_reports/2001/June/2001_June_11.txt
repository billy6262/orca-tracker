From Lummi Island: Just a heads up of orcas passing by west side of Lummi Island tonight - about
8:00 p.m. off Legoe Bay - very far out (near Clark Island) and very spread out - unfortunately so far we could not get any kind of ID - only that we think there were at least two adult males, so perhaps an L subpod (??) - and there were about 10-15 individuals - porpoising,traveling fast, going south towards Cypress Island (probly thru Rosario Strait) - a couple of breaches. We haven't had sightings of orcas going by our island much so far this year (only 3 now that i know of) - maybe they'll begin their island rounds again here soon! Penny Monday,

Renee and I were sailing just Southeast of Cobh (pronounced cove) this evening (
8:00PM Ireland Time /
12:00PM Whidbey Island Time) in Cork Harbour near Spike Island and saw two Adult Orcas with a Calf. Most folks around here would like to believe it is Mom, Dad and Baby. We haven't found any local whale experts in this area and it is doubtful that anyone here is tracking or identifying these whales. Thanks, Don & Renee

1 gray (?)
Direction:

Comments:
Just got a whale report from Bonnie at Bush Point (west Whidbey Island). She saw a large whale (possibly/probably a gray?) pass the Bush Pt. wharf at 9 a.m. this morning. It was traveling slowly south, & she only saw it surface once so didn't get a real good look at it. We did have a few gray whale sightings last year as late as
June 15th - so maybe there's still one or two of them out there - keep your eyes open, folks on South Whidbey! Susan

Saw about half to a dozen (perhaps more?) orca heading north past Otter Bay ferry terminal, N. Pender Island, BC at ~
