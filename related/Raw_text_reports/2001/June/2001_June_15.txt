Was not aware you wanted Orca news form outside this area... I have been following the "Cork 3" since they arrived (Cork Harbour, Ireland) on
June 05. A no go buffer zone has finally been put in place and the whales are now further upstream on the outskirts of Cork itself near Tivoli Docks. Ron MMRG
