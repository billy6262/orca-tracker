Susan, Saturday (
June 23rd) we were traveling in Saratoga Passage between noon and 4 p.m. and we spotted several pairs of what we believe were Minkes heading South. They were dark gray and almost black, some with white up near the dorsal fin. They made a rolling arch type movement when diving. Can you tell by my description whether or not these were Minkes? Thanks - Kristen Damazio (These were actually identified as Dall's Porpoise, thanks to Kristen's great description of their markings & movement). For more info. on ID'ing Minkes & Dall's, here's my response: Thanks for this report, & the great, detailed description - I'm sure what you saw were Dall's Porpoise, which travel around Whidbey, usually in small, & sometimes large, groups (I once counted over 75 going past Admiralty Head on the west side of Whidbey!). Minkes ususally travel alone, or sometimes in groups of 2 or 3, & don't have the "arching" quality Dall's have when surfacing. Minkes are also quite a bit larger (26-28' vs. 6'). Dall's have the characteristic white patches on their triangular dorsals, while Minke's have white patches on their flippers. But it's often very difficult to ID marine mammals, since we only get quick glimpses of them as they surface, & they're usually at quite a distance.

Susan, Finally news to report. About 12 noon Sat. 06-23-01 I saw a group of seven Orcas what I believe to be feeding and pass Rosario Beach in the outgoing tide rip beyond Northwest Island heading North towards Burrows Island. They were out a distance but were really working the tide rip back and forth. One large male. Then about 1305 hrs. another group or the same group passed heading North about mid channel. Unkown numbers. A park visitor said she could make out three males. I had no glasses. They were very far out for a naked eye visual. But they were Orcas. Rocky shore and tide pooling are great! We love you Man. Ranger Rick Deception Pass State Park (Maybe J's &/or L's off Deception Pass?)
