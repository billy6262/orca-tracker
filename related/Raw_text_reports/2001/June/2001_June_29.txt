Big parade of orcas off west side of Lummi and all across the strait today from about
1:00 to
3:00 p.m. - could have been all 3 pods - VERY spread out - we're talking miles! The ones we saw closer to shore were J's and K's I believe (J1 brought up the rear...) - Some hugged the Lummi shoreline and some were mid-channel and some were way across on the Orcas side. A lot of breaching off the northwest beach of Lummi, then more straight travel, porpoising, some milling and lunging. Headed off down Rosario Strait. There were 4 whale-watch boats, about 5 small private boats, Soundwatch, some small crabbers passing thru, and 1 tug that stopped, apparently to enjoy the show as well. Flat calm, so you could hear their breaths from a great distance, even before seeing them. What a gorgeous day! Penny

Susan, Saw your message from Penny. For your information I was on one of those four whale watching boats. We started to see the whales off of Cherry Point. Then we came down by Lummi Island and even further with whales following us. Penny described it best. They were dancing and we, over the loud speaker, could hear their singing. Our captain named all three pods too. What magnificent animals! Harry Moore
