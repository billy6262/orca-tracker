Orca Sightings for November 10, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
First, a GREAT report from Jeff Hogan!
*
Hi Susan,
My wife and I caught the whales heading South this morning,
11:20am, at Richmond Beach (so. of Edmonds). All in the center of the Strait but very spread out. Positively ID'd J-1 and probably K-16, if you can believe it, but not 100% certain. We followed them all the way down to Discovery Point, by car, at Discovery Park, where we saw both of the new calves, one was so orangish it was amazing. Lots of milling about and a a few short lunging sessions, followed by a few breeches and some honest to goodness logging. They followed the Magnolia Bluff line to the edge of Elliot Bay, when a great deal of tail lobbing began. Within 5 minutes they had gathered into a tight group and had changed their direction back North, everyone very tight and travelling quite slowly. We left them around 245pm.
Don't know where they are off to, but it was nice to see them again. Got to say watching from shore sure leaves a good feeling about the encounters. Good luck tomorrow everyone,
Jeff and Amanda Hogan

Also a call from Tom McMillan, who had heard a report of approx. 40 orcas off West Pt. around 1 pm, also reports of orcas in Elliott Bay, but not sure of times or direction - maybe south?
And from Ron in Victoria:

Hi Susan
Left Lpod 11 miles S.S.W. of Race Rocks at 1615hrs today, they were going S.W. AS far As I could tell it was only Lpod. Ron Bates MMRG

I spent the afternoon looking for a pod reported earlier off east Whidbey. I never found any orcas, but I did find about a half dozen Dall's Porpoise north of Greenbank, acting like orcas, so maybe that's what the earlier report was. I've never seen Dall's so active! Rooster tails, lots of jumping WAY out of the water so their white patches were really visible, & some spyhopping-like behaviors. I had to look twice to make sure they weren't orcas, so I'm wondering if that's what was out there earlier today.
*
Just received a message from Pat Palla of Greenbank, that a pod of orcas was in Saratoga Passage off Hidden Beach, heading north at approx. noon. That's our neighborhood, so I'm outa here, & hope to have more to report soon!

Hi Susan,
Rich has been hearing orcas on the Andrews Bay hydrophone for the last 1/2 hour and has not seen anybody. He called down to Lime Kiln and they hear them on the hydrophone there too, with no sighting. He talked to Ken and he has a sighting from D''Arcy Island. It looks like the Residents are up here today. I'll let you know if I get anything more precise.

The whales were reported going past the Center for Whale Research at
12:30 pm; then...

Tom McMillan just reported he'd talked to Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research, & that Ken was out with all 3 pods at 2 p.m. on the south-west side of San Juan Island, with the whales heading south.

Here's a reply I received from Will Anderson regarding the branded Sea Lion reported the other day by Tom McMillan. I also had helpful replies from Marilyn Dalheim & Brad Hanson of NMFS, who gave me contact info. for someone at NMML to forward the info. on to. Thanks to everyone for their help on this.

Hi-
The state of WA has been branding sea lions (freeze burning) for several years, but a number 8 would have been one of the originals branded when the Ballard Locks sea lion/salmon controversey was hot. I no longer have a list of some of the brand numbers, but others may, if it is indeed an eight. The state would have made a regular 8, but perhaps over time with body changes distorting the image, or perhaps the early brands weren't up to par...

Here's the report on the two new orca calves from the Center for Whale Research, gained from photos & information obtained by Mark Sears of Seattle. Let's all celebrate the very much needed & welcome birth of these two new calves!
Susan
*
Candi Emmons (Center for Whale Research) and I reviewed Mark's first video (from
October 29th) on Saturday Nov. 3. In Mark's video we both noticed one group had "the calf" earlier in the video, and then another group had "the calf" later in the tape.
At that time we felt certain that K-11 and K-13 were with the calf, then felt certain that K-18, K-40, K-21 and L-67 had "the calf". K-18 has "stolen" L-67's calf before, so this led us to wonder whether she was doing this again with L-67's second calf (her first died last winter). K-13 was traveling very consistently with one new baby, and L-67 was traveling very consistently with hers...
Therefore, preliminary indications are that K-pod and L-pod both have a new member!!! This would make K-13's calf K-34, and even more amazing, that L-pod has the new baby L-100!!! K-13 has had three other successful babies, so her calf is very likely to do well...

ANOTHER NEW CALF! and adult males L41, L58 & L57
Direction:
north
Comments:
Here's a report from Mark Sears of Seattle, who thankfully was out with the whales (lots of whales, could've been all 3 pods) most of today, leaving them at 2 pm at Pt. Wells, just south of Edmonds, heading north. He was able to ID the 3 L pod males L41, L58 & L57; and most excitedly.......what appears to be another new calf!!! seen with L67.Of course this new birth is awaiting official verification by the Center for Whale Research. Mark took lots of photos & more video footage - so maybe we'll get to see this new baby on the news too, if we're lucky. Susan

Susan, Today
11:45 am, kayaking along Discovery Point, Seattle, we watched approximately 20 whales heading north. Three males leading the front and the larger group in back with what appeared to be one or two calfs. Looked like J pod to this amatuer whale watcher. Sure was a sweet surprise to our otherwise grey paddle excursion. Thanks for keeping us all updated. Peace Be With You Patrick Brown
*
Note: J pod only has one mature male, so if there were 3 mature males, it most likely would have been L pod - but none of this can be scientifically verified without photo ID verification by the Ctr. for Whale research - hope Mark Sears is out there with his camera & video cam today!

Hi Susan, just wanted to let you know that whales came up to the (Lime Kiln) lighthouse around 1600. Good calls on the hydrophone! Whales were spread out individually and milling. Ken went out in the Boston whaler, so I'm sure he had some good id opportunities. Thought I saw J1, J8 and J17.

HI Susan Hope to hear from Ken Balcomb before long but J,K and Lpod all went east off Victoria at 1220 this afternoon. The new calf was seen and I hope photographed (not by me) but will have to wait for processing. The last I heard they were NORTH bound from Line Kiln.

Tom McMillan of Salish Sea Charters reports: An orca sighting off Vashon Island Friday afternoon. He only saw one orca - he was going north & didn't see any more, so figured the whale(s) must have been heading south. I'm sure he'll be in touch with us today if he sees any fins out there!
