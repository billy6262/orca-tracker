Orca Sightings for November 20, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
Good morning -
We received two calls this morning at
8:30 and
8:40 of a group of whales hanging around the Kingston area. The second caller put them about 1/2 way between Appletree Cove and Pilot Point. They were evidently feeding but neither caller gave a direction of travel or an indication of who it may be.
