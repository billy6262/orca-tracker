Orca Sightings for November 21, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
Hooray, now I can say I've seen orcas from my desk!!! I was sitting here at the computer and chanced to look up and glimpse what looked like a couple of large fins. I dove for the binocs, and quickly saw that there were indeed a number of orcas out in front of Reuben Thurman bunker (Fort Casey State Park, on Admiralty Head, west Whidbey Island), heading west. We watched briefly from the office window, then hurried out to the bluff. By the time I left you a phone message and got out there, they'd already moved a lot farther out and further west, out in mid-channel. Their general direction was probably northwest. There were a bunch of whales but we couldn't get any sort of good count, as they quickly moved westward and spread out wider than the binocs' field of view. They would move different directions, so I think they were feeding or searching for food, not just traveling. There were at least 9 and could have been over twice that. Too far away to look for babies. We positively saw one male with a very tall dorsal fin, and we think at least one more male with a shorter straight fin. We saw at least 4 breaches -- the first time I've seen that in the flesh, and seen those wonderful round paddle-like pectoral fins! I spotted them about
1:50, and by
2:00 they'd moved too far away to see. Hopefully you'll get some other better reports that will tell you which pod it was. I just felt incredibly lucky to glance up at the right instant to spot them, especially on this stormy day when Admiralty Inlet is filled with whitecaps. What a Thanksgiving gift!
