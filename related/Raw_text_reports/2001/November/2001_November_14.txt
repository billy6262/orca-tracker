Orca Sightings for November 14, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
Yippeeee!! We found the orcas just south of Bush Pt. at
11:45 a.m, & watched them for nearly 1 1/2 hrs, milling & feeding off Bush Pt, very slowly moving forward, but not traveling much in the time we watched them. Here's Howie's report of the wonderful sight we were witness to - a wonderful day to watch whales, even in the rain!

Following this morning's report of orcas heading north at 10 AM past Double Bluff (south end of Whidbey Island, on the west side) we went to Bush Point, about 5 miles north of Double Bluff. At
11:45 we saw the first blows roughly mid-channel, heading slowly north. For at least the next hour and twenty minutes, 15-20 orcas held their position, milling and foraging as a strong incoming tide brought the fish to them. There was a tight group of 6 to 10, and some small groups spread out about a mile, all of them turning slowly in all directions, with the occasional spyhop, taillob, cartwheel and half breach. ID's could not be certain, and no photos were taken, but J1 appeared to be among them.
The behavior was interesting because they remained in the same place for such a long time. Bush Point marks the narrowest point in Admiralty Inlet, with the tide flooding into Puget Sound. The whales seemed to be holding steady while the fish rolled in on the tide.

We finally left them when the wind & rain worsened, & though we looked for them again later, never did see them to confirm whether they continued to travel north, or turned to head back down south, so please keep your eyes open, & whenever the fog lifts, look for those fins out there & let us know if you see them!

Just received this sighting from the Whale museum at 10 am - we're going to see if we can find any fins in the fog out there~

Good Morning Susan - Just checked the hotmail and we received a call from the public that a group of orcas were going past Double Bluff headed NW (out of the sound). No idea how many or who. Have a good day!
