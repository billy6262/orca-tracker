Orca Sightings for November 24, 2001
============================================================

Entry 1:
A transient report from Ron Bates in Victoria:
Hi
Transients T11 and T11A south of Victoria going east at 1413hrs today.

Mark said they were traveling fast and porpoising as they were headed south, but as they turned to go back north near Pt. Robinson at around
1:30 pm, they were in a resting pattern & traveling slower. He believes it was K pod & some of L pod, including the male L58 & both new calves, L100 & K34. Further identification confirmation will be done next week when Center for Whale Research staff go over Mark's videos & photos

Noon, Nov. 24th:
What a thrill to look out our window in West Seattle above Alki and spot 5 orcas heading south! Thanks for your hard work, Susan. I really enjoy hearing about our friend's travel destinations.

Just received a call from Tom McMillan, (
11:30 am Nov. 24th) who had a report of orcas off West Pt, just north of Seattle, headed south, at about
10:30 this morning, & another report from Mark Sears' family that they were off Blake Island a short time ago, still heading south. We'll let you know when we get the details on who it is....

Susan--
This is not a definite sighting--more like a possible "hearing"--and I won't be upset if you don't send it out to the entire network:
My brother Bob (who is here on a long-term visit and who was with me at Candi's talk last Tuesday) is an amateur Aurora Borealis hunter. He woke me at
3:30 this morning to tell me to come outside and see the Northern Lights and to hear the whales. Well, it was a pretty big stretch to see the Aurora, and his hearing is much better than mine. But he'd been out on the deck for a while and said he could tell that the whales were heading south. He was sure he first heard them right off Bush Point and could hear them blowing and splashing as they moved south. I did hear a few such sounds, and could see that the water was very calm--and no ships had passed--so it wasn't "surf" we were hearing. The below reports seem to confirm.... Isn't it great to live in a place where you can hear whales passing in the night?
