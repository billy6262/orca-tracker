Hello; Super whale sighting tonight at
7:30 as the sun was going down. South Pender - Brook's Point, approx. 11-13 Orcas went by 20-30' from shore. The male had the largest dorsal I had ever seen (seemed to be two toned with black & grey, from the field guide it looked like one of the large "L" pod males????), and mother & calf were in the group as well. Heading towards Saturna Island. Best of all, not a boat in sight :-) Regards Derek Holzapfel
