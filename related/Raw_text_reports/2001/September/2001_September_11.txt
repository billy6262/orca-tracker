Hi Susan Kelley's report was correct but the whales kept on going around Turn Pt. and into Boundary Pass, passed East Pt. before 1400 hrs. The day dawned with warmth and hope, night falls over a new world outlook and the "cry they must not win." I and my family sincerely wish you and all Americans all the best. Ron MMRG Susan Berta

Hello Susan, could you relay this to all our friends. Under the heavy cloud of this morning's tragedy, may I offer a report of whales to add a bit of sunshine. J's, K's, and L's cruised up the west-side of San Juan Island in a boisterous display of foraging and cavorting, clearly following large schools of salmon. The hydrophones were a'chatter with strong and continuous echololcations as they came by the Center for Whale Research in groups of 5-12 every two or three minutes apart. One group in particular was video taped actively tail-lobbing as a group, and as they moved north the whole group turned tight to the right in towards shore and circled tighter and tighter into themselves, probably catching all the salmon we've seeing "jumping" in the past few weeks. It was a beautiful morning of playful whales, and a peaceful sunny day dawned here in the islands. I truly hope this may add a small touch of cheer to you all on this very dark day!
