Just wanted to share some more sunshine from the whale-watch side - we had a most glorious day on our last day (Sunday the 9th) with all the whales by False Bay - i have to say it was almost as if they came by to give us an awesome send-off - they had all been absent and unaccounted for the two days before, so we were thrilled to see them back on our last day. The highlight was when a group of about 30-40 lined up and started porpoising towards our boat and made a high speed high porpoise pass right next to us - perhaps the most singularly beautiful sight all summer!! our Cappy Grant has a video of it also! then they pretty much put the brakes on and slowed

Susan, Now (1900 hrs) the entire J, K, and L-pod is southbound spread out across the Haro Strait and there are LOTS of fish jumping, and the whales are surface active, with breaching, taillobbing, and lots of social behavior visible from the inshore groups, just ~200 yd.s from shore...They're also very vocal.

Hi Susan Am confused by the report from "Sharyn" about whales off Whidbey at 1600hrs. This may have been a subpod as all the rest of J's, K's And L's were North of False Bay at that time. This is what makes it interesting. Ron MMRG

Dear Susan I just finished watching about 10 minutes of whales again between Ledgewood beach and north Port Townsend. They seemed to be going north (4 pm). I don't know how long they were there I just happened to walk by the window and take a peek in the telescope. I have lost them again. Sharyn Mellors Ledgewood Beach
