north, then south,then K's south & J's north, then J's south near Bellevue Pt.
Comments:
At around 1600 K's and J's were lined up abreast in a slow resting pattern, moving north out in mid-Haro strait, a little north of Lime Kiln Lighthouse. They stayed up for a few minutes, with blows lined up for a hundred yards like a picket fence at times. Then they came up all heading south, still lined up abreast. Then they disappeared for several minutes, and when they surfaced, K's were still headed south, still lined up but moving at a pretty fast clip. J's had turned around and were now heading north, not quite lined up but in tight groups, still far out in mid-strait. After coming a mile or so north, J's went down again for several minutes and when they came up they were once again headed south, but this time they turned slightly in so that they were close to the cliffs of Bellevue Point, just north of Lime Kiln. K's stayed abreast in small groups far out in mid-strait. At last sighting, around 1730 both pods were still moving south, J's along the shore, K's way out in the middle.
