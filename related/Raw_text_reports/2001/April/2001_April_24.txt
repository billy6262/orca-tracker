Entry 2:
15:00
Reported by:
Susan Berta
Location:
Species:
Orca
Pod:
J Pod
Members:
J1 & J 8 positively ID'd
Direction:
north
Comments:
First our report: We went out in our kayaks & managed to catch a quick glimpse of J pod going through Saratoga Passage. I saw J-1 & one or two others near Elger Bay off Camano Island at about
3:20, Howie saw them further north, & ID'd J1& J8, & saw one other orca with them. We kept waiting for the rest of them to appear, but never saw them, so they either slipped by or they had split up. We saw several breaches as they traveled north in Saratoga Passage, but couldn't tell which direction they headed after that. We talked to some guys on the beach who said they'd seen orcas off North Beach (north of Greenbank, Whidbey Island) earlier this morning, & yesterday afternoon......but yesterday afternoon they were seen off the west side of the island, so am not sure what to make of that! We came home to a message from John Calambokidis, who was out doing a gray whale survey for Cascadia Research, & also saw orcas off Hat Island at
10:45 am. Now we're all headed to John's Gray Whale talk tonight in Freeland - a whale-filled day! Susan & Howie

Comments:
from Tom McMillen of San Juan Island: Susan, I left them at
2:30 West of Partridge Bank. The last time I looked back they were very slowly headed right at the Point off of the Keystone Ferry landing. They were having a great time feeding on Salmon this afternoon and it is highly possible they turned back around. They also appeared to be bunching up as we left and could have taken a nap. Will let you know if i hear any more. Tom
