Hi Susan, J-pod snuck up on us from the north at 1345 today... I heard echolocation clicks nearly 30 minutes before I saw first whales passing southbound of the Center's porch. It took exactly one hour for every individual pass, and I managed to positively identify 12 and can be certain of only 18 of 20, but there were excellent calls recorded of J-17 and her two kids. Also nice strong echolocation clicks throughout the nearly one hour of the pass-by, and good calls from J-17 and her two kids fairly close to shore. Didn't see J-1, but haze reduced visibilty for anything more than two miles out, mid Haro Strait. The encounter ended at 1545, with whales spread out down the coast from Eagle Point to Lime-Kiln. Bye for now, Kelley

Here's a report from Deborah Houseworth of Whidbey, about gray whale activity off the SW side of Whidbey Island:
Hi Susan! I did not want to bore the network with daily emails, but I did want to at least notify you that over the past few days there have been several grays putting in a daily appearance just south of the mouth to Cultus Bay as they proceed on a liesurely path from Possession Point, northwest past Scatchet Heaad, and then onward toward Double Bluff. They appear to be feeding as they go, judging from the way in which they roll onto their sides and move their fins about. Though I would like to think they are waving at me, I know better! Deborah
