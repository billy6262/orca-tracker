Hi Susan (
April 18) In case anyone is trying to keep a "plot" Rich's whales of 0100 were seen at 0730 N.E. of Active Pass about 2 miles going towards the Fraser River where Tom has them at 1630 hrs. As a matter of interest Race Rocks S. of Victoria set a record today with a total of 14 El. Seals. Ron MMRG

Hi Susan, Forgive me for the late notification. Rich heard orca blows last night (
April 17) from our home on Andrews Bay (west side of San Juan Island) at
1:00 am. They were going south and were not vocalizing. That's my only recent "hearing". No other sightings today. Rowann
