I live on the bluff between Langley and Clinton and enjoy the gray whales. The beach right in front of my house seems to be a favorite feeding area. This morning at about
7:30 am I observed a single gray well off shore between Whidbey and Hat Islands. It was meandering south taking shallow dives. Once I saw the tail lift as it went deeper and then passed beyond my view.

Hi Susan, Don Harrison here from North Pender Island in the Gulf Islands. Our last orca siting was on
April 9 ~1500-1600 hrs as we observed a pod of about 20+?? "whales" moving in a northerly direction between Salt Spring and Portland Islands. We were on land at Beaver Point on Salt Spring and watched them pass approximately 200-300 m off shore. They seemed to stop and hang around a couple of recreational vessels that had motored to the area to observe (48deg. 46.3min N, 123deg. 21.7min. N), then the pod continued northerly in the direction of Active Pass. The pod was too far off to distinguish anything significant about their markings, but there seemed to be one prominent, large dorsal fin in the group. They were surfacing in regular fashion, but off Beaver Point a few made surging motions as they surfaced, which we suspected may have been feeding. North of the 2 boats, we observed a couple of breeches? (whales leaping ~3/4 out of the water). Hope this helps.

Aloha Susan, The grays you saw must have stopped by here, around 5 pm there were 2 about 20 -50 feet off the shore of the beach at Fox Spit. My neighbor and I went down to the point at Fox Spit and one was just south of there, about 60 feet offshore. We sat and watched it feeding on its side for about half an hour, before it headed south towards Langley. It was a delightful whale-watching experience!! I don't think I have ever been so close to a gray whale before. Louise Salmin

3:30 p.m: I just saw two gray whales in Saratoga Passage, from North Bluff, Greenbank, mid-channel & moving south. I could see two more grays feeding further south, off Fox Spit heading NE toward Camano. At 4 pm I saw a small pod of Dall's porpoise off north Bluff, Saratoga Passage, heading south. The whales looked like they were diving & feeding - lots of spouts & flukes - what a beautiful day to watch whales!

Susan, I'm no whale expert, so I'm sorry I can't be more sure of what I am reporting. I just saw at least two, and possibly four, whales that I think must be gray whales, apparently feeding in the eelgrass beds off my community beach. I live in Polnell Shores; the whales were in Crescent Harbor between
12:00 and
1:15 pm. Some people who were watching with me said they heard that someone had seen the whales across the water, closer to Camano Island, yesterday. I couldn't believe how close to shore they were! At one point, I think one had its lateral fin sticking out of the water for a solid 20 seconds...I imagine it was on its side, gobbling away. Kim

Hi Susan! Three whales a-spouting, loitering near Cultus Bay this (Saturday) morning. We are heading toward low tide, so I guess it is shallow enough for them to feed. Our binoculars are not strong enough to be certain, but we think they are grays. Have a whale-filled day! Deborah Houseworth

11:30 p.m. - I've been listening to spouts in Saratoga Passage, off North Bluff, Greenbank (north of entrance to Holmes Hbr). Sounded like 2 grays traveling south, either down the passage or into Holmes Harbor. At midnight, it sounded like there were more whales present, but they were too far off to discern...

Comments:
Hi Susan, J-pod came south along the west side just after lunch (1300), and I managed to get good recordings on the hydrophones as well as identify nearly all the animals, particularly J-8!!!!!! I'm confident it was her, and I'm also confident baby J-37 was also alive and well, and there was lots of foraging too. There were the right number of whales too, to make me feel pretty sure that J-pod was all present and accounted for. By 4pm the whales had traveled south to Eagle Point and I lost them heading into the rain squalls, so they may be on their way south, or they may have "moved in" (one can hope). Kelley

Hi Susan, I called the Whale Museum yesterday (Friday), about
10:30 am with J Pod traveling north in San Juan Channel. They were traveling close together in a resting pattern. Could see J1 and also a baby. Looked like the right number for J Pod ( at least from my spotting scope at about a mile away). Sounds like Kelly picked them up later in the day after a good snooze. Barb Jensen

And now, at 4PM, I am seeing at least three hanging out just south of the mouth of Cultus Bay, about 1/4 of the distance between there and the Edmonds ferry crossing. It is hard to be precise, since they are so far out. They do not appear to be headed anywhere in particular. rather, they seem to be remaining in the same spot for quite some time (a good half hour now). The pickings must be really good out there! By the way, they are so far out that I cannot positively ID them as grays, but I am certain they are not orcas. Thanks for keeping us all up to date! Deborah Houseworth

Good Morning Susan! It is just after 7 am Wednesday morning, and about half an hour ago, I was awakened by the sound of steam through pipes. As I lie in bed I realized I was hearing a gray whale feeding right below off the beach at Fox Spit!!!! I called my neighbor and we drove down to the beach in time to see 2 grays headed south towards Langley at a leisurely, breakfast pace. What a nice way to wake up. Louise Salmin
