Hi Susan! Sal saw three orcas (two adults and one baby) playfully travelling north in Saratoga Passage on Friday evening, the 27th at
6:10 PM. All in all, we have been very blessed with sightings this year. I don't know if they are around more, or if the network is just helping us all to be more aware and more watchful. In any case, it has been wonderful! Deborah Houseworth
