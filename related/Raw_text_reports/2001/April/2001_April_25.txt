And this from my favorite acupuncturist.....luckily she had no appointments while the whales swam by her Langley office ; ) Thank you so much Susan for your phone call. I was very fortunate to have a "no show" at noon, so I ran over to where I could view Sandy Point from Langley, and I could see a few orcas in the distance. I followed them as they entered Saratoga Passage at about
12:15. As I walked along the sidewalk, with a veiw of the water, I became the Langley town cryer, calling all citizens out to view the orcas. Many heeded the call and it was a wonderful shared event, which never would have occurred without your call! As they entered the passage, only two whales stayed on the Langley side. The others headed toward Camano and were soon beyond my ability to see them (I had no binoculars on hand). One of the whales close to Langley was a male and he was traveling extremely fast. He did seem to check in with some kayakers on his way north (lucky folks!). Both whales were out of sight by
12:45 when I headed back inside. Thanks again for making this whale filled day possible!! Deborah
Thanks to all of you for sharing what has been a wonderful, whale-filled day!! And thanks especially to J-pod, for gracing us with their presence on this beautiful day~ Susan

Just got a call that a pod of orcas with one male (presumably J pod) is in Saratoga Passage - off Sandy Pt, just south of Langley, east side of Whidbey Island, headed north, at
11:45 a.m.
April 25th. A beautiful day to see whales - we're headed out to see if we can find them! Susan

And a call in from Don & Rene Wright, 2 Beach Watchers who helped put together "Rosie" the Gray Whale skeleton now hanging in the Coupeville Wharf. They were coming to Whidbey one last time before moving to Ireland for a year or so, & not only got to say goodbye to their Beach Watcher friends, but also got a "farewhale" from J -pod, on the
10:30 a.m. ferry. They saw the orcas over near Camano, & saw one of the J-Moms & her baby playing.

And from Bart Rulon: Dear Susan, I spent my morning looking for gray whales on the sw side of Whidbey. Early I only saw 5 dall's porpoise across from Langley. On my last stop I was very surprised to see an orca surface close to shore at Randall Pt. just north of the Clinton ferry dock probably around

10:30 -
11:00am. From there I could see four individuals headed north. I followed them along taking pictures, and saw one cow with calf. Also saw some darting movements at the surface which looked like they were preying on salmon. At Sandy point about
11:45am - Noon a few orcas passed very close to the point. from there some swam close to Langley and others split off towards Camano Island. From the scenic viewpoint on Sully's bluff off Saratoga Rd. I also saw one gray whale show its tail flukes, headed north across near Camano Island. The orcas passed East Point, or Fox Spit around

1:45 -
2:15pm. The big adult male cruised right next to the point for a great view, but most of the others were out at mid channel or near Camano. I'm not sure of the individuals, but the photos should tell the story later. Towards the middle of the day the orcas did some breaching, tail and flipper slapping. A Great Day, Bart Rulon What a great day! susan
