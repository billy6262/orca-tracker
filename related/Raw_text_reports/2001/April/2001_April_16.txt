Hi Susan: Thanks for your sighting yesterday. Today, Monday 4/16/01 Mark and Louise Sears spent the early morning with J-Pod while they were resting in nice tight groups- and Mark believes all whales were accounted for. He had them going south at
07:30 or so off Alkai, then they turned around at Brace Point and continued North (Three-Tree Point at about
09:00). Richard W. Osborne, Ph.D. The Whale Museum
