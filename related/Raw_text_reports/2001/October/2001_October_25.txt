Species:
Orca
Pod:
L Pod, plus possibly J's &/or K's?
Members:
3+ mature males, 50+ whales
Direction:

Comments:
What perfect timing! We got to the overlook above Lake Hancock (central/west Whidbey Isl.) at
11:45, just in time to watch the long procession of orcas going past mid-channel, still heading north. We watched until after
12:30, at which time they were past Pt. Wilson & the fog & rain was closing in making visibility impossible. There were at least 3 mature males, lots of breaching & splashing & fishing behaviors, especially between downtown Pt. Townsend & Greenbank. Too many whales & too far off to get an accurate count, but we can safely say there were LOTS of them! Susan

Hi Susan, We see that the Victoria Clipper has slowed to a crawl mid-channel in Admiralty Inlet off Bush Point. Through our glasses we can see orcas heading north, but no detail yet. Deborah Heg
