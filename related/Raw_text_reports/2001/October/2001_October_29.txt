Thanks to Mark Sears in Seattle for the latest exciting news about the Southern Residents - a NEW CALF! He was with J's, K's & some of L's from daybreak to dusk Monday, Oct. 29th in south Puget Sound, & observed & photographed the new calf, with fetal folds clearly visible. Mark's photos will be viewed by the Center for Whale Research for verification & further information - we'll let you know what the latest news is! Susan

And a report of porpoise off Ledgewood Beach, west Whidbey Island: I have been watching some fins off Ledgewood Beach for the past hour.Using 40-50 x scope.I am pretty sure there are 3-4 harbor porpoises,although they could be Dahl's.They appear black,but I think that is a function of light conditions and distance.The rolling behavior looks more like Harbor,and I saw no rooster-tails. I was sick when I read your note of Orcas at Mulilteo yesterday-I was on the
1:00 ferry,and we didn't see them. Sue Skubinna

Hi Susan, Mark Sears called this morning with an update on activities of J, K and part of L pods in south Puget Sound yesterday 10/29/01. He saw them at
7:00 am off Pt. Williams and there was a new baby. He could not tell whose. Both K and L females handled the baby for about three hours. One of the females was K-40. L-58 was the only L- bull seen. I'll let you know if I hear anymore good stuff. Rowann
