Susan, Was looking out the window this afternoon and saw about 14 killer whales eating and breaching out in front of my home - I live in Marysville, Wa. and have never seen killer whales in Port Susan bay in the past 17 years I have lived here, only grays. My son spotted the whales around
4:30p.m. They were heading up towards Kayak Point and Warm Beach the last we saw. We live at Mission Beach on the Tulalip Reservation for a better point of reference on the whales. They originated from the east, coming up along the shore line in front of our house. We were extremly excited to see them, especially when they would breach!!! There were always two whales further out front of the group. Then the others came along. One looked like it was a young one, smaller then the others. I would love to help out. Next time we see them I will contact you . Thanks Kim Larson

Dear Susan and Howie: Hope all's well. Just now (
9:30a) saw about eight Orcas heading south about 200 meters offshore of Bush Point, probably feeding on the tail end of the silver run that folks are still fishing for at Bush Point. That's it. Marty.
