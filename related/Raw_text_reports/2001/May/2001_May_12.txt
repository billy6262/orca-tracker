Comments:
Miami, Florida,
May 12: We went to the Miami Seaquarium to visit "Tokitae" (or "Lolita"), from the So. Resident Community's L pod on Saturday. She looks amazingly healthy, considering the small tank she's been in over the last 30 years. But it was difficult to watch her perform tricks for food, & to leave her there with no other orca company, knowing her family still swims wild & free here in Puget Sound. Maybe someday we can watch her swim along side them~
