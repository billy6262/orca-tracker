Comments:
Susan: Dave, Kelley, myself and my assistant JJ went out to photo id the L's yesterday (
May 30th). L12's & L25's were present, but very spread out and a bit evasive for us. So another pass by is in order before anything concrete is known about total ID's. We followed them all the way out to Race Rocks. Jodi Smith, Center for Whale Research/Orca Conservancy
