Comments:
J-pod in two groups working their way back up the coast along Deadman's Bay and LimeKiln Light. From the Center's deck at 1600 I watched as J-pod (now very tight) moved slowly up the coast of Bellevue Point off the County Park, and then turned in towards shore and circled around the tiny island just off the park, and still tight, then began to hug the shoreline and move south again, staying very tight together and very close to the rocks.

Comments:
Good morning! J's went by thru Hale's Passage this morning - about
7:45 a.m. reported off the ferry - they were heading north, traveling VERY slowly and tight - J1 and group of moms and calves it looked like - about 8 or 9 - looked like a very small one too! watched them all the way up the east side of Lummi and then they headed up north towards Pt. Roberts - i left them at about
9:45 a.m. and could still see them between Sandy Pt. and Matia Island. Very exciting for us here because they hardly ever go thru Hales Passage (E. side of Lummi) and it's fun for everyone to see them off the ferry! Where will they go next? Oh yes and there were NO boats (aside from the Whatcom Chief!) We watched from friends' decks - no acrobatics or gymnastics, (except an occasional lazy tail lob) My friend on the water over there said she thought she heard a seal making an awful commotion down by the shore just before they came thru...(?) Keep those eyes peeled! Penny

Hi Susan. This is an old sigting that a client shared with me. It seemed like a pretty unique event, so I wanted to be sure to let you know about it. He was on the
7:00PM ferry on Sunday (
May 6), and saw what he described as at least one dozen whales gathered in a group not too far from the Clinton ferry landing--near the southern entrance to Saratoga Passage. He wasn't sure that they were grays, but he was certain they were not orcas. Hope your trip was a good one. Deborah Houseworth Langley, Whidbey Island

And J pod on
May 6th : Susan We are with J-Pod moving south past the mouth of the Fraser River. It looks as though they are heading for Pt. Roberts but they are always unpredictable and they still might head towards Active Pass. They are spread out over a large area so it was hard to get a positive I.D. but we just saw Ruffles so J-Pod for sure. Time 1600.

Dear Susan, I was naturalist with the Western Prince today, and we, along with other boats, watched Juanita (a Gray Whale) (I guess she's been positively id"d) feeding in Hughes Passage near D'Arcy. Large raft of Steller's off Green Point. They must have been chowing down pretty well because they were just "veggin" when we went by. A few Dall's rode for a little while as well. So haven't seen that baby yet, but great day otherwise! Sue Miller, San Juan Island

Hi Susan! I was at the Center for Whale Research today. At around 1155 J's were going by. Spread out to 1 mile off shore heading south against the tide. Kelley is pretty sure he spotted J8 and J19 earlier. Inshore we saw the J16's, J14's, J11& J31. The two sprouters, J27 and J26 were hanging offshore about 1/2mile together, rolling and being quite active. Right off the house I saw J22, J34 and J32! Kelley confirmed J32 so that's good news! All surfaced together and followed closely by J17. J17's oldest, J28, was baby-sitting J35, but only 25 yards from mom. J17 must be getting a well deserved break from child rearing because she did two cartwheels right off the "Balcomb Reef". That seemed to be the tailend and I watched those six group up and start to travel abreast past Bellevue Point at 1247. It was a great whale fix! --Jodi Smith

Orcas Heading Toward San Juan Island.
8:30am
May 3, 2001. Orcas spotted near Monarch Head coming South toward San Juan Island. It appears to be J-Pod, but no positive identification yet. If they continue in the same direction and at the same rate they should be close enough to be seen on the live cam (www.orcacam.com) by
10:30am. Captain Tom McMillen Salish Sea Charters
