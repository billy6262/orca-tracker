Hi Susan, I wanted to let you know that K and L pod returned yesterday! At
16:00 we heard squeals on the hydrophone in Andrews Bay. Rich said they sounded like K-pod calls. We went out and looked and saw at least 2 bulls so we know L-pod was there too. The Center was out in the boat so I'm sure they will have more details soon. I also heard whales on the hydrophone at
9:55 this morning but I didn't see anybody. I'll keep you posted. Rowann

Boundary Pass
Species:
Orca
Pod:
L Pod, K Pod
Members:
Direction:
south
Comments:
L-Pod was sighted about noon near East Point (Saturna Island) heading south through Boundary Pass. If J-Pod should resume its northerly course, the two pods may well meet up along the west side of San Juan island. High Spirits, the boat from the Center for Whale Research is at this time heading out from Snug Harbor to check on the status of L-Pod . Its a good time to look for Orcas on the live cam. Check back for updates.
2:10 pm Update. K-Pod has now been positively identified and is travelling with L-Pod.
2:44 pm Near Battleship Rock. I am with the whales at this time and it appears that all three pods may be coming together - if so I will try to film their greeting ceremony for OrcaCam.

More details on Superpod Sunday (
May 20th): Center for Whale Research staff have a few more details on who was at the "Superpod Sunday" off the west side of San Juan Island: J-Pod: all present L-Pod: Members of the L2's, L9's & L35's (sub-pods of L-pod) were seen. The L25 sub-pod was not present (L pod is large & the sub-pods don't always travel together). K-Pod: We're sad to report that K32, calf of K16, born between Nov. 4th & 13th, 2000, was not present. But the GOOD news is that there was a new calf with K pod! K33, born to 14 year old K22 (Sekiu), is K22's first calf and the newest member to the Southern Resident community.
