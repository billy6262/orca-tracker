Orca Sightings for November 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today was my number 1 day with
Humpbacks
. TOTALLY MUGGED FOR AN HOUR UNDER AND ALONGSIDE THE BOAT. The following are Melisa Pinnow's words..."As we were watching a humpback, it went on a very long dive. While it was under, I said "watch this, its gonna be just like Baja." I was right. The humpback suddenly surfaced within feet of the boat and played with us for an hour, staying just feet underneath the boat, spy hopping on both sides and even fluke waving its gigantic tail just feet away...." Back to Capt. Jim...In all my years this is the most amazing amazing experience I've ever had with a Humpback. I would swear it was listening to us. She was curious about the boat. As another boat approached she went to visit them for a few minutes then came back to us. There are times when whales connect with humans in boats. I know this to be a fact! This was one of those times. Epic moments! - Capt. Jim Maya

Never thought I would have an encounter like this with
a humpback whale in Haro Strait, near San Juan Island
, Washington. On Maya's Westside Charters it was an unbelievable experience on a mid-November, 2013 afternoon. - Jeanne Hyde

10:30 - In Lincoln City OR watching three Transient Orcas
, 100 yards offshore, heading southbound. Right now! We couldn't get any ID's but assumed they were transients. We tried to catch up with them to get ID's but had no luck. It was interesting. The Orcas were traveling the exact same distance offshore as 90% of the sea lions we had sighted. We believe they were three females. - Spencer Domico

10:00 AM - Three possibly 4 Orcas sighted off Lincoln City, Oregon
beach heading South. First spotted around 10 a.m. off beach access NW 15th and last seen in Lincoln City after 11 a.m. near Siletz Bay. There was a male in the group. Was not able to get any pictures. This is a confirmed sighting from the Oregon Marine Mammal Stranding Network. - Jane Holbrook

I am the head of an environmental NGO in Cape Verde, Africa. Some friends of mine recently saw
some orcas just off Sal (west coast of Africa)
where we live and this is the first time this has been reported to us. We are reaching out to anyone who may be interested in this information and who may have details of any previous sightings. - Jacquie Cozens Please report any sightings to Orca Network.
