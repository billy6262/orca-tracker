2:40 pm -
Marie Waterman of WS Ferries called to relay a report from the Evergreen State of
three orcas off Turn Island
, just out from Friday Harbor, heading south.
*
A small
pod of Transient mammal-hunting Orcas
were sighted right outside Friday Harbor this afternoon traveling south in San Juan Channel. One of the most well known transient Orcas in our area is
T20
(pictured above). He has a very distinctive nick at the top of his tall dorsal fin. T20 almost always travels with T21, who is likely a female relative. Some researchers believe they are siblings!
