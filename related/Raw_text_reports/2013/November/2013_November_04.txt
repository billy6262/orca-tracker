Orca Sightings for November 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
On a recent Black ball
ferry crossing from Vancouver Island to Port Angeles
I noticed some activity off of our ferry. This was taken just as we exited Victoria harbor. The attached image (see below) is a clipping of the full shot, but this is really where the action is. These animals were about 100 yards off of the Starboard side of the ferry. - Anthony Istrico

Whales off Whidbey again - members of
K pod
kept us on our toes going north up
Saratoga Passage
then turning south. After
passing Langley
at a fast clip late afternoon, their dorsal fins and blows were silhouetted against the snowy slopes of Mt Pilchuck in the fast fading light. A beautiful sight to behold on a cold, clear November day. - Sandy Pollard

moving south in
Saratoga Passage
at Bells Beach Whidbey Island headed toward Langley. - Angela Johnson Zink

Wow! how blessed I am..numerou
s Orca just swam north through the Saratoga Passage past Bells Beach just after 2pm
. They were spread out across the water & were joined by a skiff from NOAA with a crew of 3. Love to have their job. - Kristin Carlson
*

1:00 pm -
We are in the 3900 block of
Saratoga Passage. 48 degrees 3.340N x 122 degrees 26.610 W
. Saw at least 2 large male orcas spread out. One group closer to Whidbey for a change. A few farther out in middle of channel. Seemed to be under a lot but staying in same area, though heading north. Guesstimate..5 or 6. - Melissa Lebo

12:20 - Passing through Langley
. - Lydia Farrell

1200 noon & 1500

pod of about 12 Orcas
heading North in Saratoga Passage between Camano Head and Langley about

11:35 - 3 orcas reported playing RIGHT off the Clinton
, S. Whidbey ferry dock by Mac Lamay, who was on the
11:30 ferry. More orcas were milling at the south end of Hat/Gedney Island, further to the north.
*

11:30 AM -
We saw a pod of
Orcas off the west side of Gedney
(aka Hat) Island. - Larry Bender
*

8:20 am -
reports had members of
J & K pods southbound in the Edmonds/Kingston ferry lanes
. With no whales in sight I head north as confirmed sighting started coming in from happy ferry boat passengers on the Mukilteo/Clinton runs. At Mukilteo I sight whales in Possession Sound heading northbound, traveling in small groups, & spread out by a couple of miles. Continuing w/the pods as far north as Baby Island, I could see whales spread out across the Passage and north to Greenbank & Cama park.

11:15 - from Mukilteo I see a group in the middle of
Hat/Clinton/Camano Head
, milling.

11:20 - at least 6 more
northbound approaching Clinton
. Includes big male. woo hoo! Just saw another adult male just past Clinton ferry...they are streaming northbound mid to west of mid channel. More whoo hoos!
When the tail-enders rounded
Fox Spit
all foraging and other activities ceased,
Js & Ks quickly turned and began porpoising south
gathering in larger and tighter groups. I watched until the last whales rounded Sandy Point into Saratoga Passage then boarded a ferry to Whidbey, luckily catching the tail end group from the shores of Langley. On the southbound journey, a stop atop
Bells Beach
invoked much awe upon hearing their blows, thunderous tail & pec slaps, and seeing spyhops & breaches. By

4:30 pm the pods had reached Langley
, one bunch numbering 15-20...passing human families, shopkeepers, townspeople, and visitors who had gathered on and above the shores. I asked some elated seeing-orcas-in-the-wild first timers to ring the Whale Bell, eliciting an eruption of cheers from shopkeepers, townspeople, and visitors. At the hands of Susan and Howie, the Whale Bell rang once more. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

11:18 -
Lynn Malecki at
Columbia Beach
, just north of the Clinton ferry dock, sees "
lots of orcas spread out
" heading north.
*

11:05 -
Maia of WSF called to say a
pod of orcas
was headed south in the
Clinton/Mukilteo
ferry lane.
*
Just saw them on the 1030 ferry
. - Courtney Wilson
*
Was also on that ferry watching the
Orcas foraging, breaching while slowly heading North
. It was either a very large Pod, or multiple Pods...many of them spread out. Our ferry made a very wide berth around them & went very slowly. I've been riding the ferry for years and never encountered such excitement. It was awesome! - Patti J Colahan
*

10:14 AM - Orcas near Possession Pt
. I saw quite a few orcas (12 or so, possibly more or less) traveling north from
Possession Point toward Mukilteo
. One large one and many smaller Most were too far away for pics but I have several pics and one video. Here is a link to the video. - ken cross

Marilyn Armbruster saw
at least 6 orcas from the 10 am ferry crossing from Clinton to Mukilteo
, along Columbia Beach ( south of Clinton ferry) northbound. She hasn't resighted them from Mukilteo lighthouse beach.
*

9:08 am - orcas moving north from the Mukilteo
shipwreck up the east side of Whidbey nearer to the east shore. Not sure if this is the same or a different group than reported off Edmonds/Kingston heading south at
8:20; and the latest report is of orcas heading north past Clinton (the S. Whidbey ferry dock) at
10:20 am. Lots of whales going in different directions! - Cassandra Miller

Kurt Schmidt Saw them
near Picnic Point headed north around
9:00

Saw quite
a few orcas heading south
just now. Viewed them
from the MV Walla Walla between Kingston and Edmonds
. Shipmate said they were spread from mid channel to closer to edmonds. At
8:20 when I originally saw them they were right in ferry lanes. - Ben Abrahamsen
