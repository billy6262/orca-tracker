Orca Sightings for November 11, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
The very word "Lags", our nickname for
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
(Lagenorhychus obliquidens), sets off joy in our hearts here on San Juan Island...Perhaps
400 of them
, maybe more, today
in front of Snug Resort
and my house. I have only seen this once before in our waters...
AND Orcas! The T123s.
More later...What a day. - James Mead Maya
