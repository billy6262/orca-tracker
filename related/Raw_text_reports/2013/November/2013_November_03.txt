Orca Sightings for November 3, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I have some pictures of what appears to be
3 Orca surfacings near Blake island about
1:45pm
. I was far away and zoomed all the way in with a very good camera and lens. Gonna have to wait til I see them on my computer later. Still out here looking now. - Peace Corey
*
A friend of mine lives
by Manchester dock and watched them this morning around 9 AM
she left after about 30 mins so I don't know which way they went. - Brianna Robinson
*

8:30 - Orcas in Puget Sound
. A call just in from Mark Redelowski of
a large pod of orcas between Blake Island and Manchester docks
, non-directional, just milling, with others a quarter mile closer to the dock.
