Orca Sightings for November 26, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:30 pm -
We were just outside with our dogs and could hear
a pod of orca out in the Sound
- too dark to see them, unfortunately! We're about
a mile north of the Kingston ferry
and it sounded like they were headed south. It sounded like a lot of them - lots of blowing, but no splashing. It was a pretty calm night or else we might not have heard them. It was pretty cool! - Shirley Bomgaars

11:40 am - Chamber's Bay gold course
(south of Tacoma, 4 miles south of Narrows bridge). Small pod of
4 or 5 orcas
were deep but we watched for an hour move from one location to another. A small one breached with fins showing but, the rest were deep. They were traveling. One came up and was playing a little bit but, looked like another brought it back down. They were deep.
Headed north to Narrows bridge
I presume. - Rebecca Harden

Matt McCulloch from Tyee Charter called at

3:30 to report seeing about ten orcas off the south end of Whidbey Island
while fishing on
Possession Bar at
10:30
this morning. There was at least one adult male, 8 females and a juvenile who breached 4 or 5 times. Some of his passengers took photos which he will send whenever he gets them. There were no other reports of orcas anywhere today, but it was foggy so it's not surprising that these were not seen from land.

Noon - off the Mendocino CA headlands, a pod of 10 to 12
were in my sight for about 15 minutes. - Michael Wilkerson
