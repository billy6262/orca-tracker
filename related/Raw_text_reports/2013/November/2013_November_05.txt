Orca Sightings for November 5, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Amazing encounter with the
southern residents off Bush Point
, Whidbey Island, late this afternoon (thanks to Marilyn Armbruster posting on FB). We arrived just in time to see 7/8 whales grouped together close inshore, and watched as they interacted socially, played, foraged, changed direction from north to south and back again before drifting in leisurely fashion north in the twilight. The water was flat calm, like glass, as we listened to their powerful blows resounding across Admiralty Inlet, before driving to Lagoon Point to share final moments before darkness fell and the whales picked up the pace as they headed northwards to the open sea. - Sandy Pollard

There were mid channel ones and some coming in close too, they came in
near the lighthouse around
4:30
( 5-6 of them) and a few stragglers across at mid channel and near the Marrowstone side still at around 5ish. we saw many breaches too along with spy hops,tail lobbing, milling, circling back and forth. it was great......- Marilyn Armbruster
