Orca Sightings for November 20, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I was on
Magnolia bluff and saw a dorsal fin and 2 very scared seals
...I could see it in their eyes. Also saw sea lions... rolling around...I was on the beach there. I was there

1:30-3
and right in front of us, maybe 100yds out we saw a fin chasing 2 scared seals. But instead of diving (maybe was too shallow) it was just passing by at a good rate. - Brandi Weill

Around
3 -
3:15 pm
I was up there too and spotted some marine mammal activity south off the bluff. Saw dorsal fins but agree, didn't seem big enough for orcas or dark enough, more gray, but they were slightly obscured by a tree. And a bunch of seagulls landed too. And yea, looked like a mad dash by some seals. And also heard a couple whoof outbreaths. - Jill Irwin

2:17 -
Watching them now just above
Yeomalt
. Yeehaw! - Anne Duggan Smith
*
2 pm -
I watched some of it from
Sunset Hill Park above Shilshole
. What a show! Even from across the water with so-so binoculars, it was clear they were having a hunting frenzy. - Susan Vennerholm
*

1:42pm -
We have now moved down to
Manitou Beach
... they are trending south. Still very active mid channel. Looks like a baby baby in the pod!!! - Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn
*

2:13 -
still off
Manitou
. Foraging.
Bainbridge shore.

1:30 -
they are slowly moving south.

1:05 - Bainbridge Island
: Watching the whales, confirmed as Transients (solid saddle patches, killing seals!) - she counts
about 7
of them, including 2 juveniles and a young calf, less than 1/2 mile from the Bainbridge shoreline,
between Skiff Point and Rolling Bay
. They have been hunting there for the last hour, and now are moving slowing south again. They witnessed one or two kills, saw a seal flying through the air, blood and gulls. There are 20 lucky folks from Bainbridge getting a thrill today, watching this from a bluff above the whales! - Susan Marie Andersson

1:05 -
Just spotted
about 5 orca 500 yards off Skiff Point, Bainbridge Island
(east central part of Island). No binoculars so couldn't get a very accurate count. One younger animal breaching a number of times. I worked with Ken Balcomb for several years, so a passing knowledge of J,K & L pods, but unfortunately not close enough to ID anyone. - Sharon Nogg

Hi Orca lovers. It is

12:40 pm
. A group of about a dozen of us (people) have been treated to an amazing show for over an hour.
A group of transient orcas have been foraging
, successfully off
Skiff Point/Rolling Bay
. And they are still here. Parking scarce. - Susan Marie Andersson

There have been about
a dozen orcas
breaching and otherwise surfacing for at least 20 minutes between
Bainbridge Island
(1 mile N of Skiff Pt.) and
the tip of Magnolia
. - Bill O'Neill

11:24 am -
now we've got some breaching and milling around happening. They might hang out here for a bit.

- In rolling bay now! On the Bainbridge side moving south quickly. Lots of blows but not much else on the surface. Very tight group with a bunch of gulls hanging around.

. haven't resighted the pod as of
10:25 (but i moved).

9:53 -
seeing
some fins Kitsap side
, still north of yellow mid channel buoy South of Kingston, north of Jefferson head. Swooping gulls must be lots of scraps. Trending southbound but of yet not seeing large numbers. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Just spotted them with binoculars from the
Kingston ferry terminal
. They were south of the ferry terminal way out far from the dock. - Molly Dennin
*

8:55 am -
John Rogstad from the WA State Ferries called to relay a report of
at least ten orcas off Apple Tree Cove, near Kingston
, just north of the ferry lane, "frolicking" and having a great time, and not traveling any direction. Stay tuned, it's a beautiful day for whales.
*

08:39 AM -
Whale news on a cold clear day. First white water, then fins, black and white body and water spouts and they seemed to stay all in the same area,
right off the Kingston ferry dock
, south side. - Laura Sanderson
*
Humpbacks
4 humpback whales between Race Rocks and East Sooke Park
. We were out on the water today looking for whales. We searched from Oak Bay Victoria BC to Sooke BC. A lot of life was out in Juan de Fuca Strait with numerous bait balls which fed over 6 species of marine bird. As we approached the bait ball we witnessed bits of fish and scales and deduced that the birds were feeding on sardine. We found a small group of harbour porpoise at Constance Bank, and four humpback whales off East Sooke Park (Lat 48 11.4 and Long 123 40.27). The humpback whales were doing repetitive 5 minute long dives and were very investigative of our vessel, as they did numerous circles with an average circumference of 9.0 m. The weather was clear and calm but temperatures were freezing and daylight was fading. - Josh McInnes
