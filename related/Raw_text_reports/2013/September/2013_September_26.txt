Orca Sightings for September 26, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A magical, glass smooth, sunshiny day with
almost all of L-pod
, with many family groupings, tail slaps, a few breaches and spyhops, a glimpse of both babies Joy and Cousteau....lovely day! Thank you whales! - Bonnie Gretz
*
4 Transients
travelling in Canada south from the
Westshore Coal Terminal towards East Point
. They were
T037 and T037A
. And most likely T037A3 and T037A2. I did not see the T037Bs. DFO's Jared Towers told me "The T037Bs have been known to disperse as has T037A1. T037 is also often found separate from the rest of her family. This group is really quite fluid compared to most, even though the dispersal behaviour is quite common in transients in general." - Peter Hamilton
*
A group of
about 7
came in fairly close to
San Juan County Park
. They moved out past the island off the shore.. but they were about equal the distance of the island by the park.. a couple of them lingered around the kelp bed. - Vicky Doyle
*
We were with
5 transient killer whales
near the
Southern Gulf Islands. T109 A's
- a mother with 2 babies and a calf and T12 A an enormous male. They were eating a harbour seal, their main source of food. After feasting the whales became quite active and naturalist Jen noted at least 15-20 breaches and the two juvenile whales breaching simultaneously. Transient orca aren't generally this active, and it was noted today was so spectacular it was better than a show at Sea World. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

5:45 pm -
On walk on
False Bay Rd
. South of the actual False Bay... too far for any ID's... counted
3-5 dorsals
, one for sure a male. Lots of splashes, very exuberant activity. Headed North... but as I headed back home... splashes way out on Haro at that point. Big splashes, probably from breaches. - Cher Renke
