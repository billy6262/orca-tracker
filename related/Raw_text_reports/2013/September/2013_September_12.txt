Orca Sightings for September 12, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Beautiful day today at
Sand Heads
(mouth of the Fraser River) with the
T37's
. Flat calm waters and T's chasing seals....nothing beats it! At one point the whales actually started to head up the river towards Steveston!! They turned around pretty quick though and started heading south. - Gary Sutton, Wild Whales Vancouver

We saw members of
J, K and L near Victoria
. We were out with Puget Sound Express. The orcas put on quite a show, full out of water breaches, spy hopping, tail slapping, thrilling. The crew put a hydrophone over the side, great to eavesdrop on all their chatter. Salmon were leaping out of the water. - Linda Chancler

I photographed
two young orcas
playing with each other right in front of the
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. The photos include good views of the dorsal fins and saddle patches, yet I am unable to match them with any of the Center for Whale Research photos. - Andrew Reding

K26 Lobo was rounding Turn Point, Stuart Island. - Jill Hein
