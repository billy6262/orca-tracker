Orca Sightings for September 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Was in
Rosario Strait
and encountered at least two pods feeding and traveling. A
t least 2 pods, K for sure. Cappuccino
came up in front of our boat! Tried to stay 400 ft away but he had a mind of his own! We were in a Ranger tug boat from Montara Ca., the Keep on Tuggin about
2:45 when
Cappuchino K21
decided to come visit our tug boat. We were trying to stay 400 feet away in our tug but they were all around us feeding! Never knew when one would get so close ! Cappuccino was curious about our Ranger Tug I guess. What a handsome guy! - Joyce Richards

3:00 pm at Norwegian Point, Hansville, Washington 2 calves, 3 Females and at least two Bulls

My daughter and I were out in front of
Point No Point light house

There is
a pod of Orcas 1/2 between Point No Point and Foulweather bluff.
We've seen a pod with probably
8 or 9 Orca
in it. First sighting about

6:00 PM
. It's almost
7:00 PM and they're still out there. - Chuck Strahm

3:31 -
at the point of
Point No Point

total of six

2:48 -
SE of
point no point
. Maybe out from Eglon. Definitely a baby too!!! - Valorie Clausen

AM
, spotted
a greyish, sleek-looking whale
(25-30 ft long) with a dorsal fin 2/3 way back on it's body spouting water out of its blow hole. It was only a few hundred feet
off Sunset beach on Colvos passage/ west side of Vashon
. - Elizabeth Van Deventer
*
Just spotted a grey whale [believed to be the
humpback
seen in the same place and time] just off my place at
Salmon Beach Tacoma
heading north towards Pt. Defiance. He was very close to my deck about 25-30 yards out. Beautiful rolling pace and his large V shaped tail. Was about

9:50 am
today Tuesday. - Dino
*
Humpback sighting. We saw what looked to be
a single humpback
off of shore (40-50 yrds) of Salmon Beach
swimming north thru the Narrows
. Large tail fin came out of water as it swam towards Pt. Defiance. Swimming, breathing at surface and tail fin. Traveling north just rolling to the surface every 2-3 mins. Beautiful! - D M
