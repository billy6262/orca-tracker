Orca Sightings for September 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Its hard to explain, but based on the whales' behaviour it really did appear that
they were in a "mellow mood"
. I'm not sure how else to explain it. They would break apart and forage for a time (which they did successfully, as I personally saw three examples of salmon in their mouths), then come back together and be very tactile and mill around with each other. It gave me the impression that they were enjoying time with full bellies, not worrying about rushing to the next feeding spot. It filled me with joy to see, not once this summer have I seen them so laid back. They were not diving very deep (lots of "sharking" behaviour) and the salmon were jumping all around (mainly pinks). It was as if they had the luxury of just letting the salmon come to them. It was wonderful to see them expend energy on socializing and playing, which they did when a freighter past by (the
K13s expertly rode the pressure wave
for a surprisingly long time, and the
J14s came speeding in
from over 600 yards away to join the surf club). The sport fishermen that were in the area catching the same fish the whales were after seemed of little consequence to the orcas, as they ever so coolly passed between all the small boats. All in all, a very special day with the whales. I wish that they could always feel such food security as they must have had today. - Tasli Shaw

Not far into the fog, at the
mouth of the Fraser River
, dozens of Resident Orca from
J and L pods
magically appeared!! The orca playfully jumped and lob-tailed, spectacular displays of playfulness with these beauties. Later skipper Mark found some
Resident Orca near San Juan Island
, then even more Residents a little further up San Juan Island, near
False Bay
. - Naturalist Jessica, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

(Transients)
T12A
was skulking through the kelp bed near
Pedder Bay
. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch,

Mark Malleson found
eight Transient Orca hunting near Race Rocks
, plus many Harbour Seal, Steller Sea Lion, California Sea Lion, and one gigantic Elephant Seal...all likely attracting the interest of this unusually large group of mammal hunting Transients. - Naturalist Jessica, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

Graham Dewitt of WA State Ferries called at
7 am
to report
a pod of orcas in Rosario Strait
this morning, about a mile and a half from the
Anacortes ferry dock
, heading south.
