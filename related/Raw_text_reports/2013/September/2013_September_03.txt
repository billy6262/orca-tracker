Orca Sightings for September 3, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
7:49 PM
- Just passing through the
Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary
and saw a group of perhaps
6 orcas
at 48 12N, 125 32W. It pretty hard to tell how many there were, so that's a very rough estimate. They were headed north. I hear that "dolphins" and "whales" were spotted earlier today, at least some right as we left the Strait, around 124 54W and the Canadian border. I didn't see them, and have not heard any reliable identifications. - Patrick A'Hearn via Ed Bowlby

K25s
dorsal fin. -Jim Maya

Today was AMAZING. Incredible. Astounding. Absolutely OFF THE FRIGGIN' HOOK! Glassy seas, dramatic mountains, dark clouds, and spunky
orca soup
...all the while being almost totally alone with them. My best trip of the summer...hands down. And this is why September rocks. - Katie Jones

We were ecstatic when we heard Mark had found a
superpod of resident orcas at Hein Bank
! There were
members of J, K, and L pods
present in the area spread over a couple mile radius. Our Vancouver Ocean Magic spent most of their time with 10 members of K pod. Naturalist Brittany identified
K16 "Opus" and K21 "Cappuccino"
as well as the K33 matriline. This family was being very active tail slapping, spy hopping, and rolling over on their stomachs. In the afternoon, skipper Mark came across
a group of transient orcas
who were seen in Victoria Harbour just last week! There was
another group of transients off Trial Island
who was killing a harbour seal for over an hour! We were treated to a transient as they left the harbour! On Constance Bank they followed
a group of transients
north ending up near Trial Island. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
