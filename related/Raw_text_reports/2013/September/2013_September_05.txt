At

6:30 PM
I was surprised to see a
humpback whale in Haro Strait
just south of
Lime Kiln Lighthouse
. It breached more than five times as it made its way north, surfacing often. It passed San Juan County Park just after 7 PM, and at this point was surfacing a couple of times and then going on long dives of six or seven minutes. - Monika Wieland, San Juan Island
