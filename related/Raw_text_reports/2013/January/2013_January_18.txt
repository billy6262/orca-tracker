January 18 Jim Wallace called at 10 am today to report a sighting from 1/18 about 5 pm, of a whale about 15' long in the surf at
Twin Harbor State Park, Westport WA
. He said it was gray with a bulbous head. He saw it 5 or 6 times and he said at one point "It was looking at me." He looked it up and decided it was probably a short-finned pilot whale, but from the description and a sighting of a probable Risso's there yesterday, it
may also have been a Risso's
.
