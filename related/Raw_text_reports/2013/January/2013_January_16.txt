We had the
J10s, J11s, J16s, and J17s
spread out from
Humphrey Head on Lopez Is.
to the west side of
Blakely
and the south edge of
Orcas Is
. The whales headed westerly and
funneled into Harney Channel
and past the Orcas ferry landing. The whales headed about halfway up West Sound before grouping up and heading back out. We left the whales milling at the mouth of West Sound around
1600
.

A friend of mine was staying at a cabin on
Lopez Island
At roughly
2 pm
, he noticed
an orca
in a bay
between Upright Head and Humphrey Head
. (I consulted a map and found one that calls it "
Shoal Bay
" but other maps leave it un-named.) The orca appeared to be feeding and spent about twenty minutes, gradually moving from the area around Humphrey Head by crossing the bay and swimming past Upright Head and continued onward from there. It was alone. I'm curious if this is a typical place to find an orca? The people who own the cabin have vacationed there for many years and never seen an orca in the bay.

John Rogstad of WA State Ferries called at

1:20 pm
with an update on the
orcas off NE Lopez Island
- the ferry Sealth is now reporting
6 - 8 orcas
, frolicking and moving in a NW direction off Frost Island.

Marie Waterman of WA State Ferries relayed a report from the Captain of the Ferry Sealth, of
~ 10 orcas in Thatcher Pass
(NE of Lopez Island, WA), milling and fishing, at

11:50 am
.

I was on the

10:30 am
ferry from
Friday Harbor
. There was a good sized group of
Orcas
yesterday on the
ferry route from Friday Harbor to Anacortes
. It appeared that there were at least
10-12 individuals
, including a couple of good sized males, all heading west, near Shaw/Lopez, escorted by the Coast Guard boat. As they approached the shore they all started slapping their tails on the surface, first one and then another.

T046's
east bound in the
Juan de Fuca Strait
offshore of Beechey Head.
