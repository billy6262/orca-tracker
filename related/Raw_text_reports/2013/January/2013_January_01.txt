Orca Sightings for January 1, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:59 -
Watched them the same time you did from
Baby Island
(Whidbey Island) too....but first seeing them in Langley! WOW....the best way to start out our New Year Hoping many others saw them too. What a great day.

Headed up to Camano after Marilyn reported to me that [
orcas
] were off
Langley
and moving slowly north...and just so happened Alisa and I had the same idea, and we ended up getting to
Camano State Park
at almost the same time! At first it looked like they were going to stall out and not get up our way before dark. They were still a bit away from us, with several spread out across the channel, with most of the bulls being even farther out. But eventually they got moving, and 4 of them really put on a show for us right off shore at the State Park! It appeared to be 3 females with at least one youngster. They slowly rolled along just off shore from us--and then when they got right out front, they just started sort of logging--floating still on top a bit, as well as some slow spy hops, tail and pec fins rolling about.....just chillaxin right in front of us! Pretty cool. By then a bit of a crowd had formed too, and with the calm quiet waters, and mesmerized people looking on--it was perfect. Dead calm and quiet, except for the occasional "Whhhooopppfff" sound of the whales exhaling....very, very cool!

An as of yet unidentified pod of
6-10 orcas traveled up Saratoga Passage
on this gorgeous New Years day in our ever beautiful home, the Pacific Northwest. Filmed from Camano Island State Park (save for the first shot of the Mukilteo lighthouse & ferry where my day began with Pam...in the fog). After a foggy try from Mukilteo, what a beautiful day Pam and I had watching them from Camano Isl State Park with a beach full of happy humans!

Still more coming, moving slowly. Just south of
Cama beach
and more past the park already heading north. We counted maybe 10 and a few young ones.

We finally got over by Baby Island to see the
orcas between Camano Island State Park and Whidbey Island, between
3:45 and
4:45
. They seemed to be heading from the Camano side of the passage over toward Greenbank as we left them. They are probably right in front of our house, but will likely be dark before we get home!

Alisa Lemire Brooks just called she has spotted them from
state park on Camano island
. Whales are mid channel nearing Elger bay. She is moving up to the bluff to get better sense of direction and position.

We had sightings of
Orcas in Saratoga Passage between
2:30 to
3:45
this afternoon. We live just south of
Elger Bay off Mabana on Camano Island
. They were going north. We saw both males and females, and there was some spouting. Our neighbor said in her 10 + years here, this was the first time she has seen them here.

, heading up Saratoga Passage.

East of
Point No Point
whale blows could be seen at

1:30
. The thick fog obstructed the view. A possible research vessel stopped just south of whidbey, and then I think followed the whales up the east side. They did not come up admiralty inlet as I hoped they would.

5 - 7 orcas
were seen from
Sandy Point, Saratoga Passage
(48.0350 122.3767) traveling North approx.

1:30 PM
, 2 males. I just happened to be taking my New Year's Day walk along Wateredge in Sandy Point and saw the orcas go by. There were about 7 individuals with two males. Thrilling and what a way to start the New Year!!!

About
1 pm
, a pod of
approximately 10 orcas
observed from bluff vantage point, moving North around
Sandy Point
and into Saratoga Passage. 50 to 100 yards offshore. One very large (male?) in the lead, what appeared to be two females with calves well back in the pod. Seemed like multiple calves with each female.
