I was out fishing for Blackmouth with my uncle on the south side of Anderson Island. We were headed back to Zittel's Marina on Johnson Point and encountered
a pod of Orcas
. The pod was headed northwesterly
along Nisqually Reach toward Johnson Point/Henderson Inlet
. We kept out distance, but would guess that there were
at least 6 whales
in the pod. A couple of the dorsal fins were quite large. Our last sighting of the pod was just on the east side of Johnson Point. They appeared to be continuing to move westerly to Dana Passage. It appears the pod was feeding. On what, I don't know. The reason I believe they were feeding is because of the seabird activity in their wake. The sighting of the pod occurred between

3:00 p.m. and
4:00 p.m.
Pretty cool!

Orcas
sighted going under the
Narrows Bridge and passing by Gibson Pt
between Fox Island and Chambers Bay Golf Course heading South earlier today. They were moving pretty fast and there were several. Hopefully will see them heading back too. This was the best pic I could get taken from the porch on Fox Island!! - with Jay Gray.
