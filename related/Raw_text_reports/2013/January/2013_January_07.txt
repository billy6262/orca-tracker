Orca Sightings for January 7, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I read in the last newsletter about
a baby Gray
that appeared to be lost. Have you tracked him recently? Where was he last spotted? I swear I just saw him at
about 11 am near Brighton Beach off the coast of Whidbey by Clinton
, heading north through the passage. If not, it was the largest sea lion I've ever seen ... I saw his head a few times, but then a boat came perilously close and he disappeared.
