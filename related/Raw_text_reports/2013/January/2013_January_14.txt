Orca Sightings for January 14, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today I saw
three orcas
in the same area along the
Mukilteo
shoreline in Possession Sound as I have reported them before. First I saw one swimming to the north, probably close to where the people who live on
Marine View Drive
saw whales the Sunday before last. Then I saw two about a half mile farther north swimming to the south. Then I saw all three near where I saw the two swimming. This time I actually could see the white blotches on one of the whales - not clearly, however. I noted the fins on at least the two whale that were swimming together were not large. These sightings were off and on during a period of about 30 minutes from

3:00 p.m. to
3:30 p.m.
My fingers were frozen, but it was worth it. Janet Carroll, Mukilteo WA
