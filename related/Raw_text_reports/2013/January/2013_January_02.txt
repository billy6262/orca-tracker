Orca Sightings for January 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today we went out and at about

1:30
we caught up with the
T137s (T137, T137A, T137B, T137D)
. They were swimming at high speed west of
Beecher Bay
(8-10 miles SW of Victoria BC) about two kilometers offshore. About 45 minutes were spent and they covered 4 kilometers. We hypothesized that either they heard the communication of the Southern residents which were sighted earlier further to the South east or that they were eagerly trying to catch up to another group of mammal hunting orcas. It turned out that there were three groups I was able to ID: the
T36Bs (T36B, T36B1 and T36B2), T68Bs (T68B, T68B1, T68B3)
. Within the T36Bs I was able to catch a small glimpse of
T68B2 the new calf
.

They're getting closer and more talkative now. So nice to
hear them
, especially in the winter time.

We had the (matrilines)
J16s, J17s, J11s, and J22s
but they were spread out over three miles. We may have missed other groups.

Brad Hanson (NOAA Science Center) just called at

12:36
to say he's with
J pod off Point Wilson
as they exit Admiralty (we thought they were transients) heading generally westward.

Watching 2 males from
lagoon point at
11:15 am
.

We watched about
10+ orcas from Fort Casey
from about

11:10 until noon
. They were spread out at first, then grouped up closer as they began to exit the inlet. Saw a couple of breaches and tail slaps.

Elsa Leavitt called at

10:35
while watching a tall
dorsal fin
heading north just off
Bush Point
. Then two more came up.
*

9:06 am -
Dave Carney on the Victoria Clipper called in a sighting of
4-5 orcas off Double Bluff
in Admiralty Inlet, moving slowly north.
*

9:04 -
Two small orcas are between
Skunk Bay (Hansville)
and Whidbey Island as we speak (mid channel). One breach noted. The B.C. ferry slowed considerably so they may have had a better sighting!

I spotted
killer whales at ~
11:30
moving east bound quickly south west of
Constance Bank
. They were then picked up again through Big Eyes by Gord Rowles moving quickly west for
Race Rocks at 1315
. I caught up with them to see them go through Race Rocks Reserve at
~1330
. They traveled between 8 and 12 knots until I left them at ~1430 mid strait south of Sooke. I then spotted what turned out to be the
T036's and T037's
moving west a couple of miles south of the
T137's
.
