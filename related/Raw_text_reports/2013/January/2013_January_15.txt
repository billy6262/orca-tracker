Orca Sightings for January 15, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I don't know if Charlie Wright ever sent you a photo of the
Risso's
that we saw on the Tacoma Christmas Bird Count on
December 15 around
Day Island
. This is the best of three photos. There were two of them.

4:20ish -
KIRO TV has a report and short video of a
Gray whale in the Thea Foss Waterway, Tacoma
- possibly the same whale reported in Commencement Bay, Elliott Bay, Puyallup River, and Ruston and Edmonds Fishing Piers in recent weeks?
