Orca Sightings for January 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whales hazing a seal. This afternoon (about

2:30 pm
Sunday 13
January 2013) from the shoreline we watched
one large, 2 medium and 2 smaller orcas
tail and fluke slapping and rolling for about 40 min within roughly 3-10 m of a rocky beach. They moved along and parallel to the beach toward
Fulford Harbor (Salt Spring Island BC)
when we last saw them. They were circling and surging head down and then around - there was a harbor seal sometimes visible among them - it was quite hard to see as it was only briefly on the surface. There were gulls diving to the whales and circling. We did not see any blood or fat slicks so maybe the seal survived. We have quite a few photos showing the whales trying to ram the seal and catch it between them. The photos show the dorsal fin if that helps you recognize the whales. We live at the southwest end of Roland Road, Salt Spring Island and first saw the whales coming toward the shoreline at 48 44 32.81 N and 123 25 54.06 W

From Dave Ellifrit: Nice shots! One of the adults is T49B and the rest look right for it being the same group (
T49B, T49B2, T65B, T65B1, and T49A2
) we left off Spieden Island on the 12th. Cheers, Dave

Steve Pearson called from the
Edmonds fishing pier
, where at about
4 pm
a very large dark shape suddenly appeared from under the pier, swam through the squid jigging lines, blasted a loud blow, and proceeded westward. Sounds like
a gray whale
