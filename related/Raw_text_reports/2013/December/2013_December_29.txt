Orca Sightings for December 29, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Orca disguised as driftwood
.

Entry 2:
Brookings-Harbor, Oregon
97415. The ocean there was calm, with swells, maybe around 4 ft., some sets of larger 6 ft. swells. I was watching what seemed to be a driftwood log that always stayed in the part of the wave that rises up high just before it breaks. It was drifting SE in line with the beach. I wondered if that was really driftwood because some of it projecting out of the water seemed to move slightly. It featured something like a knobby thing sticking up a bit in front, a much higher curving backwards fin shape on top, and some funny looking things sticking up a bit in back. It seemed about 8-10 ft. long. It resembled a driftwood piece of tree battered, with broken limbs, black in color. It is not strange to see driftwood that looks like it has a dorsal fin, but when it floated upwards to the peak of a much larger wave,
I saw an oblong white thing that shone in the sunlight
, resembling the oblong face mask of a snorkeler. It could not be that. And the black shape had some white showing on the underside. I heard seals barking nearby as this is near the mouth of the Chetco River. Drifting along in the place where the waves rise up the highest, another larger wave showed there sure was an oblong white patch shining in front, and some white on its belly, and it adjusted to that wave as it started to break. I thought that is either some funny driftwood, or a predator disguised as driftwood. A woman was walking along the sidewalk, as though she did not see anything different or exciting. I looked at something else, maybe my coffee. I wondered if I should go out to get a closer look. When I looked back, the "driftwood" had completely disappeared, not washed on the beach or anywhere. Then, I saw two seals diving into a wave around the place I had last looked. Today I searched for what orcas look like, and the horizontal oblong white eye patch gave it away. It is most interesting that an orca seemed to be deliberately staying still to resemble driftwood and deliberately drifting along where the waves were highest before breaking in order to observe everything going on along the beach, people, people with dogs, cars, RV's, restaurant, as well as anything going on with seals. The predator disguised as driftwood suddenly disappeared probably in pursuit of the seals. - Donna Goss
