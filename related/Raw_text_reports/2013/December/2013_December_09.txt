Orca Sightings for December 9, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
11 am -
WA State Ferries reports a pod of approx.
12 orcas in Haro Strait off Speiden Island
, heading north.
*
After being alerted by Giles that
orcas could be heard on the Lime Kiln hydrophones
, we went out to find them. Sounded like residents on the hydrophones. At about

10:30 am
we found them about
3 miles offshore of County Park in Haro Strait
. The leaders were approaching the Kelp Reefs marker. We saw
two groups of at least 6 orcas each
surfacing about a mile apart, with an adult male between them, about 1/2 mile from each group. Then both groups disappeared, with only 2 males surfacing together. Next, the 2 males disappeared. It was cold, so we left. There could have been 20 plus orcas. They likely are the orcas spotted by the ferry in Haro near Speiden Island at 11 am. - Sharon Grace
