Orca Sightings for December 17, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
My family and I were at
Lime Kiln Point on San Juan Island at
1:30 today
. We saw a small pod of
maybe 7 orcas
that were hanging out briefly and then went booking North - even porpoising out of the water. I believe it they were Transients. Before they took off we saw a spy hop and a tail lob. There was at least 1 bull, maybe 2 and a mother and baby. They were pretty close to shore. Lots of birds flying around - must have been some good food nearby. We got lucky today!!! :) - Coleen Moore
