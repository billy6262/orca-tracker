New years eve
23.30 to 23.45 in Elliott bay just NW of pier 70, a pod of at least 4 Orcas swam along with the sail boat
as we navigated through the party boats. We had opted to sail in the light wind while waiting for the fireworks. They appeared and seemed to follow around the boat as we transitioned through the party boats till we reached clear(er) water. Then we saw them no more. They appeared to be swimming calmly around us as we traveled at about 3 knots. We saw 4 fins at one time, but the pod was probably larger than that. We saw several tale flukes and heads. They seemed calm. Their accompaniment lasted about 15 min. We gave notice to the other mariners of their presence on Marine VHF Ch 16. - Brian Scally
*
Rebecca Sherwood reported being visited by
8-10 orcas in Elliot Bay
while aboard their boat for New Years Eve celebrations last night at

11:30pm
. She reports they saw the pod leaving them heading to the north. Everyone keep your eyes on the water and let us know if you catch sight of the whales. Fog has lifted in some areas revealing a beautiful New Years day.

New Year's Eve Orcas. The

11:35 p.m. sailing from Bainbridge to Seattle
was filled with New Year's revelers and
slowed for much of the sailing for orcas
reported in the area. One passenger I spoke to saw at least 3 fins. A great way to end 2013. - Cathy Warner

, just south of the mid-channel buoy. There are a hand full of females further to the east. They are all still moving south but very slowly.

mid channel mutiny bay still heading south...they are staying submerged for a long time...? - Jim Barrett

And again, at about

11:45
, when we were SURE they had all passed, I saw
a big male fairly close to the Whidbey side
. But we both looked for the last 15 - 20 minutes and have not seen another side of him - he must have gone into "Stealth whale" as Mike & Suzanne used to say of Luna. But he's out there somewhere, should be
between Mutiny Bay & Foulweather Bluff
by now, or maybe a bit south.
11 am -
just as we thought they had all passed by, another group just showed up off
south Bush Pt
, with another male and several females so far. Saw a neat line up with a breaching whale on one end of it earlier, wonderful whale watching today, most close enough to hear. Also saw two pods of porpoise traveling NW close to shore,
just south of Bush Pt
