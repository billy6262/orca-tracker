2 pm -
At least
10-12 orcas
were seen for over an hour feeding near
Pt. Defiance
! One very big bull and a small calf! Three of the males stuck close together, they all worked together to round up fish (or seals) to edge of the shelf where it dramatically drops off, they could pin em up to the wall of the shelf! Absolutely beautiful to watch! Boats were getting too close irritating the whales! We watched the whole hour from where the lighthouse use to be! - Dayna Campbell

Michael Molnar called to report seeing
a single, adult male, orca, heading north about 200 yards off the WA coast near the Quilleute River
.
These were taken from the beach in
LaPush, Washington
. Right after this guy showed up on scene there was a lot of mammal activity in the area. We were swimming our dogs in the surf using a tennis ball, at one point while one of the dogs was about 20 feet out a sea lion popped up 15 feet away and watched him. Soon after that there were several seals around. do you think this was because of
the Orca
??? - Michael Molnar
