Orca Sightings for December 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
President Point
(about 2 miles south of the Kingston ferry dock),

2:30 pm
- females had a large sea lion that they were playing with. Seemed to be teaching their younger ones. Sea lion got away and headed for the beach and whales stayed only 20 yards away watching him. Don't know the outcome but probably not in the sea lion's favor, he looked beat up and tired. Lasted about 2 hours. Large male 25 yards off beach showed off his moves for us, doing all kinds of tail slapping, breaching, slow barrel roles and other fun. Always stayed about 100 yards away from the females playing with the sea lion. - Whitney Sackman

About

3:00 pm, President Point Kingston
(about 2 miles south of the Kingston ferry dock), pod of about
8-10 Orcas
playing between Mid Channel buoy and Kingston side for about 1 1/2 hours, spy hopping and body splashing. Large male and females with calves. Always so exciting to watch from my home. They finally headed north. - Margaret Steen
*
Approximately
8-12 orcas were off President's Point
for approximately 1 1/2 hours. One observer (a former Alaska fisherman) said they were training their young to hunt. A sea lion was injured or killed as they breached, swam in a circle, and hunted. Approximately

4:20 p.m.
the orcas swam north toward Whidbey Island. - Pam Wilson
*

3:40 -
I'm looking west with binocs from north beach at the shore line south of
apple tree cove
at a very active group maybe only 100yds off shore. There's a lucky bunch of watchers on that beach getting done good pics for sure! So much splashing, full body breaching, tail slapping etc. - Jennifer Greiner Clark
*

3:22 -
The first two just moved out of my sight from
Lincoln Park
, West Seattle. They were at the Southworth ferry dock, heading north.

2:48 pm -
spotted one orca off the
N. end of Vashon Island
, near the ferry dock, heading north, closer to the west/Vashon side of the passage. - Trileigh Tucker
*

3:00 -
the southern group is now visible from the
north end of Vashon
! - Whale Scout
*
Around

3:00 in Kingston, WA
an
Orca pod lingered off President Point
for a good hour or more. The male put on a great show, coming in just feet from the beach. Such a treat to watch! - Angie Heuer
*

2:27 -
Right next to the
Kingston ferry
drop. Small group with huge male. - Whitney Sackman
*

2:44 -
After that last group dive, they came back up waaaaay over on the Kitsap side. Not easy to make out from
Shoreline/Edmonds
now, impossible without binoculars. Every so often the entire group stops surfacing and disappears under water for up to 2-3 minutes. Wonder what they're up to... Herding/shoaling fish maybe?

1:40 -
Seeing some of the most active killer whale behaviors from 2 or 3 of the many animals across from
Richmond Beach
(Edmonds/Shoreline), approximately mid channel. Been watching full body lunges, porpoising and many other behaviors since around

1:15 PM
. Just watched an inverted full body breach through binocs! Three other animals were doing sync'd surfacing. Overall group is slowly making their way north. - Dave Haas
*

12:14pm -
More Orcas at
Dash Point
(north of Tacoma). - Kelly Burns Keenan
*

12:16 -
the group off
Rolling Bay
is still headed north and trending more toward mid channel now rather than close in to
Bainbridge
. Only occasional dorsals spotted in the haze.

11:47 -
they appear to be headed north - staying under for long periods

11:38 -
at least 2 dorsal fins in rolling bay very close in on the
Bainbridge
side. - Lynn Batson
*

11:42 -
Sounds like north group is northbound near
Rolling Bay
and the south group is northbound somewhere near
Dash Point
, which means likely to head up the east side of vashon. - Amy Carey
*

11:02 -
John Rogstad of WA State reports the ferry Tacoma on the
Seattle/Bainbridge run
slowed down for 12 orcas frolicking and spyhopping in the traffic lane just off Eagle Harbor.
*
I was on the

10:40 Bainbridge ferry
and saw
7-10 orcas
up close! The ferry had to stop so they could swim under us : ). Seems like they were headed north and swimming pretty fast. - Michelle Haines
*

11:08 -
They have us quite a show. Passing Vashon headed slowly
towards dash point from Browns point
.

10:55 -
They're in a line headed east at
Owen Beach
.

10:38 -
They're now circling near a small fishing boat that anchored off the point.

10:21 - 5 or 6 Orcas
northbound from tip of
Pt Defiance
. - Jason Cook
*
9am -
boat
Fauntleroy to Vashon 6-7 orcas
looked like they were feeding and headed south towards Vashon - mid Channel. - Aimee Demarest
