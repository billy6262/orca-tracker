we watched distant orca outlines in the sun as they surfaced, slowly moving northward, with a few foraging diversions and taillobs,
spread out for several miles 2-4 miles from the Whidbey side.

2:15 pm -
after watching the orcas pass by for about 30 minutes, thought they were all by us, then looked up to see more coming! They are traveling very spread out, still
heading NW out of Admiralty Inlet
. The leaders must be
at or close to Bush Pt. by now
, with more further back, between N. Mutiny Bay and the entrance to Hood Canal. Beautiful day!

1:45 pm -
it looks like they are
heading NW into Admiralty Inlet
, between Mutiny Bay (Whidbey Isl) and Skunk Bay (N. Kitsap) now, looks like the little NOAA boat is with them. So far the sun has kept the fog from closing in so we can see them!

First glimpse of blows NE of Point No Point, heading up Admiralty Inlet. - Orca Network

gave us a pass right
