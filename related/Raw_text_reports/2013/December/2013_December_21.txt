Orca Sightings for December 21, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:30 -
Maia reports a single orca seen at Frost Island, just east of the north end of Lopez Island.
*
Through thick fog and chilly drizzle I stood watching for orca swimming past Bainbridge Island yesterday in the waning light. Orca Network had been posting most of the afternoon that a pod was making its way south in Puget Sound. Around 3 pm, reports brought them close to nearby shores and I finally gave up trying to make headway on my Christmas decorating and grabbed a rain jacket and binocs and headed out. I made it to a favorite lookout spot on the southeast shore of the island within 10 minutes, and within 2 minutes had them in sight. My teeth were chattering, and holding the binoculars still was a bit of a challenge. I promised myself I'd throw on more layers next time I go running for the door after hearing "they're back." I was soon joined by a couple of fellow orca watchers, and while we were rewarded with only a few fleeting glimpses from our roadside perch
at Rockaway Beach, the sight of the tall, black dorsal fin
breaking the surface of the steely gray waters of Puget Sound never fails to quicken the pulse. Once you see an orca in the wild, you will know that is where these magnificent belong. Forever wild and free. - Susan Marie Andersson
