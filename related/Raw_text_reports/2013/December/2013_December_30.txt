Orca Sightings for December 30, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
T087 and the T090's near Discovery Island
traveling north up Haro Strait. - Mark Malleson
*
A buddy who is a floatplane pilot saw them between Porlier and Sandheads... We picked them up about
1.5 miles NW of Active Pass
. Got to see
J and K pod
go south through Active Pass for the first time in 12 years. I have seen L Pod do it a couple of times but have NEVER had J's and K's do it. So awesome and super active when they exited into Swanson. - Simon Pidcock
