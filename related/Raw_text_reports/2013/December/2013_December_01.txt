Orca Sightings for December 1, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Note: we don't have IDs on this group of orcas near Point No Point.

3:40 - Three orcas just passed Point No Point, heading south
- closer to the Edmonds side now. - Amber Brust

2:15-

2:30 -
We just videoed
3 Orcas playing in Skunk Bay between Whidbey Island and Hansville
. Normally, they are closer to Whidbey Island, but today in the still waters, they came much closer to the Hansville shore (about 1/2 mile), heading generally south toward Point No Point at
2:30. - Debby Replogle

3:55 -
They are just nearing
Gold beach on maury island
, mid channel in a pretty tight group. Went around the point about 3ish. I left them half way down maury still moving south. It will be a few hours before they would hit the entrance to colvos if they go there. Also not uncommon for them to go all the way there then turn and head back the way they came. - Amy Carey

2:58 -
perched on a road
south of Three Tree Point/Burien can see pod
. Going to be a sweet pass by for all at Pt Robinson. From this vantage pod seems to be bunched up...there are a lot of whales! - Alisa Lemire Brooks

2:56 -
Sounds like the
orcas are reaching Maury Island
, headed south toward Pt Robinson. Will they circle up the west side of Vashon Island, keep going south toward the Tacoma Narrows, or turn around and head back north? - Orca Network

My first time seeing whales today. Saw on Facebook that these guys were on the north east end of vashon so we hopped the ferry from Tacoma over there and stopped at the first park we found. Saw whales way out in the water (barely) and as they swam past us we met some nice folks who told us a better spot to see them down the road. Went over to the other spot and waited, and sure enough
they swam less than 50 yards away from us
. This s&#% was dope. The video sucks because it's from my phone but man it's rad to know these dudes are in our backyard. - Alex Fazekas-Boone

Here's another beautiful photo of the S
RKWs passing Point Robinson this afternoon
! This is a mixed group of youngsters and adults from
J and K pods
:
Suttles J40, Se-Yi-Chn J45, and their mother Samish J14, with Ripple K44 and his mother Deadhead K27, Scoter K25, who was satellite tagged about a year ago. The tag barbs broke off in his dorsal fin and are still stuck there in what appears to be a depressed area of his fin, Skagit K13, his sister Deadhead K27, and Rainshadow K37.
. Many thanks to Melisa Pinnow for identifying these orcas! - Wild Northwest Beauty Photography

11:50 -
Still heading southbound by
Blake Island
. Strong wind and waves on their dorsals is creating large sprays, making them stand out a bit amid the white caps. -v Tanya Hunnell

11:15 -
Jeff Hogan sees
at least four orcas heading south between the north end of Blake Island and Alki Point
, in windy, wavy water.
*
11 am -
Fast moving pod of perhaps
6 to 8 southbound Orcas
, spread out, mid-channel,
between Alki Beach and Blakely Rock
. Seen from North Admiral - Dan Ciske
*
Humpback spotted in Saanich Inlet
this morning, Sunday, at

10:30 am
. Must be the same one we saw the other day. We have lived here 5 years now and have never seen this many sightings before. - Karen Gray
