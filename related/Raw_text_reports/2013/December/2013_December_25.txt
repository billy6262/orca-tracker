Orca Sightings for December 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Did anyone get a photo of the
two huge breaches
right in front of
West Point lighthouse at sunset
? From Sunset Hill we could see about 30 people standing out on the spit below the lighthouse, and the whales went right by the bouy and showed off a little. - Susan Vennerholm
*
After waiting for a looong time in
West Seattle
our persistence paid off. Saw a few scattered from
Alki
long after sunset
in the dimming light. At least one male and a couple smaller, presumably females. Not close enough for photos. They were still heading south. Brrrr! - Mike Russell
*
From

4:40 to
4:50
in waning light, we pulled off on South end of
Rolling Bay, Bainbridge Isl.
and spotted a few further south mid channel when all of a sudden in the stillness I heard the unmistakeable blows of
orcas
. Ed and I watched an adult male, a female and a calf about 1/2 mile from us forage as they trended southbound. They appeared a little bit sleepy, the calf looking so cute as it completely logged for over 10 seconds. Best end to a rather sparse (for us) sighting day.

4:20 - orcas
have grouped up some. This later group more west of mid channel crossing
West Point/Rolling Bay

4:09 - been watching
a group of 10-12
spread out in smaller groups in glassy calm water, sightline
Faye Bainbridge and Carkeek to Golden Gardens
still southbound. Breaches, tail slaps and a little one in the pod. Nice to be ending the day seeing orcas who eluded our trip to Kitsap - Alisa Lemire Brooks
*

4:05 -
They are past
Presidents Point
now in Kingston.
At least 7
. One large male in the rear. They are close to the west side of the sound. - Corrie Beamer Urquhar
*

3:52 -
watching them make their way south of
Golden Gardens
. They're not moving fast. - Jessica Pagan
*

3:50pm - Orcas, 6
or so going past
Shilshole marina
to the south. Merry Christmas! - Veronica Von Allworden
*
Perfect sighting of 4
orca on Christmas Day at
3:45p off Meadow Point
headed towards Golden Gardens Park. - Michael Hamm
*
One of the
orcas seen earlier today from Carkeek
. Great to be there with such a fun group of orca lovers today. Happy holidays!!! - Steve Smith
*
At about

3:30
(when we went back into Shilshole) they were
spread out from at least Carkeek Park to south of West Point
. They were still moving quite fast, they are just so spread out in small groups that it sounds like they might be going quite slow. They appeared to be moving at about 5-7 knots, so if they keep that up they might be at Alki by now or soon. - Alex Wetmore
*

3:30 -
It was glass calm on xmas day 2013 as we watched a group of about
16 orcas heading southbound near Seattle
, about
1.5 miles west of Shilshole BayMarina
and 1.5 miles north of West Point/Discovery Park. They were traveling and well dispersed over about 1/2 mile. Several pairs included juveniles. We were in our sailboat motoring (no wind) so we shut down as they passed. We could hear more coming from the north and saw more to the west towards Point Monroe,
counting at least 16.
We were one of 3 boats in the general area that appeared to have encountered the orcas. A fine xmas present! - Scott Tobiason
*

3:29 -
there are still some making their way past
Carkeek
. I'm headed to Golden Gardens to see if I can catch the bull that was "leading" the way. - Jessica Pagan
*

3:08 -
Jamie Grundhauser called with an update from
Carkeek Park
:
Orcas
are surfacing right in front of them not far offshore, and others are still visible across Puget Sound near
Kingston
. They turned north briefly then continued heading south.

2:32 -
Whales out by
Indianola
way to the west side. Heading south. - Jack Nolan

just cleared
Point Edwards in Edmonds

2:11pm -
Wow! One or two animals are pretty close in to the
Richmond Beach
side. If you're at Richmond Beach or Carkeek, keep your eyes peeled for these east-side whales!

1:37pm -
The main group is spread out on both sides of the mid-channel buoy, rapidly approaching it across from Richmond Beach / Jefferson Beach.

1:31pm -
At least one has already made it to the mid-channel buoy. They are booking it today!

1:28pm -
Seeing them from
Richmond Beach
now. Group is heading south, mostly mid-channel and maybe a bit west of mid-channel. Best views likely from Kitsap side! - Dave Haas

Our family has been enjoying watching
a large pod of Orcas just off Richmond Beach
on this glorious, sunny, sparkling Christmas Day! What a gift! All the binoculars are in use - what a delight!! Surfacing over & over, the whales were heading south, but suddenly turned & headed north, coming even closer to the shore. Wonderful treat! - Karen Weber
*

1:20 -
they are very spread out across channel still heading steadily south. From
Kingston
we saw some foraging, breaches, tail lobs. we are moving to Indianola in hopes to see them from there south.

Thanks to Alisa Lemire Brooks for alerting us to
Resident orca calls on the Port Townsend hydrophone at
8:18 am
. We don't know direction of travel, but most likely headed in, so let us know if you see them. Yay, Christmas whales!
*
Possible gray whale - Just saw what
looked to be (not sure) a small Gray headed towards Belfair off the South Shore of Hood Canal
. Am on the beach on the South Shore of Hood Canal. It was swimming towards the end of the Canal near Belfair. It was clearly gray in color, much bigger than a Dahl, too gray for a pilot whale, large flukes, spouting as it slowly porpoised through the water seemingly on a mission. The last time I saw a gray come through here a couple years ago I'm told it got caught in the low tide (as the Canal is only 30-50 feet deep here at mid channel) and died near the Thelar wetlands. I watched for it to come back but didn't see it. It was clearly not a Sea Lion and if a Gray it had to be an immature one traveling alone. - Ginger Miller
