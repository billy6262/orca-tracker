Just watched
a group of about five transient orcas
aboard a WA State ferry right off the
Lopez Island landing
. They were full of breaches, pec slaps, both regular and inverted tail slaps and head stands! This was my fourth time ever seeing orcas from a ferry in the twenty years I have lived on San Juan Island. Made my day. - Melisa Pinnow

Thanks again to Alan Hobbes Buchanan for the call about whales in Harney Channel and for waiting for us to get there! Nothing like a last minute boat ride and whale watch to make your day. Calm water, gray skies, green shorelines, and the sound of blows made for a beautiful afternoon. So much family social time too! All the kids playing together and chasing
T49A1 (the male), and T49B3 (less than 6 months old)
was so cute. - Ivan Reiff
