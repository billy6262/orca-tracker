Entry 1:
A most wonderful, frigid, adrenaline rush tells of a dream, some might say an obsession, fulfilled. Kathleen Bean sees
orcas from Golden Gardens Park
in Seattle, and takes some gorgeous photos.

About

this Saturday afternoon, there were
a number of orcas spread widely between Seahurst (Burien) and Vashon Island
. They were moving south bound. Dorsal fins and blows. - Tom Benedict

Off Alki
. This was my first time seeing them. Absolutely incredible! - Barbara Bonner

K34 Cali (born 2001) passing Dilworth, Vashon Island
. The rest of Cali's family was beyond that waterline, close to Three Tree Point, as they passed Dilworth. Thanks to Melisa Pinnow for confirming Cali's ID! - Meg McDonald, Wild Northwest Beauty Photography

I happened to be at the whale view walk (go figure!)
south of the aki lighthouse
near alki beach in west seattle and
at least four orcas
passed by there apparently heading towards Vashon Island. I couldn't estimate the number but presumably it was the same pod your reports indicate was in Ballard a few days ago. I didn't have a good zoom lens but took a few pictures that I'm attaching. The time is approximate. I have a couple more photos, although all of the same quality from a distance. - vinay krishnaswamy
