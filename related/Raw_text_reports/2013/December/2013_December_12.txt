Orca Sightings for December 12, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
4 pm -
We spotted
4 whales in the Salish sea near Yellow Point
(Gulf Islands, about ten miles SE of Nanaimo). We have a condo at the Inn of the Sea and they were right in front of us. They stayed for about 20 minutes feeding. There was a mother with a baby next to her and two others. - Karen Green
*
Took this just a little bit
north of Olympia at Burfoot Park
.
10-15 transient orcas
consisting of adult females, juveniles and an adult male. They were gradually making their way out of Budd Inlet but had just made a kill as seagulls were feeding on scraps and the orcas were being very active with spy hops, back dives, tail and pec slaps.
T037
may have been of the females but they were too far away to tell for sure. - Melisa Pinnow

1:31 - Orcas heading north out of Budd inlet
off of Dofflemeyer Pt./Boston Harbor. - Douglas George
*

11:50am -
There are now whales or other big marine mammals spouting, feeding and playing in
Budd Inlet in front of Gull Harbor
and north, not as far as Burfoot Park; (cannot see to the south). A neighbor sighted them by 10 am. There was a small boat respectfully watching. Any reports or confirmation - please let us know. I saw 2 with large fins and a group with 2 large and 3-4 with smaller fins not far away. I want to say orcas. - Wendy Eklund

11:31 -
They are still here and now watching them I think there may be more than 10, there seem to be quite a few.....

11:15 -
They were headed south but they have been staying put for about 15 minutes.....

11:10 -
We can see maybe
10 orcas in Budd Inlet
off of east side in front of Gull Harbor. - Caty Whiteford

10:30AM - 8 Orca Heading toward Olympia
! - Chris Keller Galvin
*
At

10:30AM I counted 8 Orca heading south from Hunter Pt.
toward Olympia. At least one male and one baby. - Keller galvin
*

10:35 -
I saw
4 Orcas
swim by - between
Carlyon Beach
(off Steamboat Island Rd) & Hope Island - I think it's Eld Inlet - I';m so excited I can hardly type. Anyway, it looked like a mom & baby & 2 other adults. Hope others can confirm. - Joy Loffler
*
This morning at around
10 a.m.
a
pod of five orcas
cruised by in front of our house on
Pickering Passage
. We are about
1.5 miles south of the Harstine Bridge
. One was in the lead and the other four were a little way behind. - Christy Rowe
*

11:10 -
Apparently there is a group (
10-12
) that just passed
under the Harstene Island bridge
, heading south. That means they're possibly coming into Budd/Eld inlet territory OR Totten Inlet or both.

9:57 -
There are
at least EIGHT orcas
currently heading south in Olympia by
Boston Harbor into Budd Inlet
. - Kim Merriman
*
Saw what we believe were eight orcas in
Pickering Passage
, between Harstine Island and the mainland,
2 miles north of the bridge to Harstine
, about
9AM
. We initially saw a group of four, which was followed by a second group of four, swimming very fast toward the bridge that connects Harstine Island to mainland. I was struck that the white patches on them seemed more gray than white. - John Hamilton
