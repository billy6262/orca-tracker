We live off
Mabana on Camano Island (south of Elger Bay)
, and were sitting out in our hot tub tonight about

9:15 pm
, and heard
a whale/whales threshing around and breathing
. It was low tide, so they were a distance away. It/they hung out for around a half hour and we could hear them head south, but they soon returned. Didn't hear as much activity after that, but still out there.
*
Just spotted
at least 4 Grays heading north of Camano Inn at about
6:30 pm,
watched til they were out of sight....Have an Extraordinary Day!
Aspen

A Grey is headed south in Saratoga Passage at 5 pm
. He was in
Camano Island's Madrona beach
about 15 minutes ago and moving slowly, fairly close to the beach.

Yesterday afternoon (
March 7) our walk/run/jog/shuffle became pause/look/find them again/oooh/ahhhh... we (wife: Kathy) and I were just starting up the zigzags on the
northwesterly end of Ebey's Landing
area to the bluff trail. We paused to look at an inbound U.S.Navy ship and noticed the three spouts... they (definite four, maybe a fifth) stayed in viewing (binoculars) for approximately an hour of pauses and walk a little ways, look again.
Four (certain), maybe a fifth, orcas approx 3.2 miles S/SW from northwesterly end of Ebey's Landing Bluff Trail
. Lat 48.17ºN Long 122.77ºW. They weren't going anywhere--moved a little bit northwesterly, moved a little bit southwesterly, seemed to just be playing. First sighting approx

4:30 p.m
. (7
March 2013), last sighting approx

5:30 p.m
, when they did the "Hmmm, they just disappeared" thing. They stayed in sight, played a lot, lots of splashing--too far away to tell exactly what they were doing--just entertaining us? Kathy (wife) guessed at one male (noticeably largest), two females, one smallish, and we could not decide on being sure about the fifth one.
John (and Kathy) Morelock, Coupeville, Washington

Justine from the Victoria Clipper called at

6:30 pm to report a sighting of 4 orcas
, including 1 adult male, in the
Pt. Townsend/Keystone ferry lanes
, mid-channel, heading south.

From Robin Baird:
K-pod and L-pod have spent the last few days off the southern Washington coast
- the map (above) shows movements of both
K25 and L88
since about 8 PM on
March 5th, through this morning (
March 7). Brad Hanson reports from the NWFSC cruise that yesterday (
March 6) they were able to collect four more fecal samples and two prey samples, to help in assessing diet. You can follow the movements of the Bell Shimada at Ship Tracker.
