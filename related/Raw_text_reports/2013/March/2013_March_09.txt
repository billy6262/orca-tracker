Orca Sightings for March 9, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
and were again able to spend the day conducting prey and fecal sampling from our small boat based off the Bell M. Shimada. The whales foraged extensively which resulted in us being able to
collect 11 prey samples today
. The whales turned around at Cape Flattery that evening and headed south and moved through the same general area again on Sunday. We concluded our research cruise on the Bell M. Shimada prematurely due to the budget sequestration on 9 March and returned to Newport, Oregon on Sunday 10 March.
We have received

A pod of
4 or 5 Orcas cruised past East Point about noon to
1:30 today
, and then turned around and headed back West. They were quite actively jumping and moving at a casual pace. I was on the shore so they were too far out to get a good picture. They appeared to be Transients to me but I'm not sure. I took this picture with my iPhone (see below). A tour boat cruised up quite fast from the Langley direction and slowed down suddenly and coasted towards the pod that was going towards them.

I just spotted
the pod of orcas in Saratoga Passage - at 1 pm
, they are mid-way
between Elger Bay on Camano Island and Greenbank on Whidbey Island
, still heading north. I can see at least 1 adult male.

Captain Carl and the Island Explorer 3 were with the
Orcas off Langley
today all the way as they were feeding, to
Elger Bay
; they then went into a resting mode. They believe them to be the T-100s.

5 - 6 orcas heading north past Langley at

Orcas in Saratoga Passage

At least 6 Orcas
putting on a show in the
Saratoga Passage off Whidbey Shores beach
, yesterday,
1pm
, being followed respectfully by a very large whale watching boat of excited people. I am guessing Biggs because of the curve of the dorsal fin.

PENN COVE ORCAS
WESTWARD HO
Late Saturday afternoon, turned to boating from Mariner's Cove Beach Club marina, in search for action. EUREKA/FOUND IT! WALA
ORCAS
!! As in Biggs? whales [transients].
From Snakelum Point, to Long Point
, and westward ho;
almost to Coupeville wharf
. Observed feeding, frolicking, some breaching, and tail slapping. Not, positive, due to sun glare, but, very well could have seen a seal or porpoise "tossed" into the air. Seemed, to be 2 large males, one especially, with tall/large fin, leading the charge. With sun setting, majestic views of Mt. Rainier to the south and Mt. Baker to the north. What first
appeared to be a pod of 7 to 9
, might have been closer to a dozen, when trailing them leaving Penn Cove. Kinda difficult to be sure of the count. Finally, parted ways in mid Saratoga Passage; as pod headed south towards Rainier and I headed north towards Baker. If not spectacular, pretty close to it.

Kathy Degginger called to report
a pod of orcas mid-passage, out from Tillicum/Tyee Beach (Port Susan) in the afternoon
.
*
Sandy Gitchell called to report
a pod of orcas in Saratoga Passage at
1:15 pm
, passing
near Baby Island
(entrance to Holmes Harbor, Whidbey Island).
*
The
Orcas
were a great sight
this a.m.
from our shores here in
Langley
. The Welcome the Whales flag is now flying from the front of the Chocolate Flower Farm store plus we have the flags for sale to support the Orca Network.

I
heard a whale
last night after dark
just north of Kayak Point
. It stayed around for about 30 minutes.

We received a call from Mike Maurice, reporting a sighting of
3 orcas (1 small, 1 medium, 1 large), 6 miles south of Tatoosh Island at
5:30 pm.
At first I thought they were likely Transient orcas, but given the position of K and L pods, it's possible it may be some of them as well.

On Saturday, we bypassed the offshore killer whales and ventured further offshore with the hope of finding fin whales, which we have encountered with increasing regularity in the outer waters of Washington state in winter and spring.
An estimated 10 individual fin whales were photo-identified and several satellite tags were deployed
. Very little is known about the population structure and movements of fin whales in the eastern north pacific, and IDs and tags from this region contribute greatly to ongoing photo-ID and telemetry studies seeking to support management of this endangered species along the US West Coast.
