We are on our
7th grey whale of the day
. The first 2 were in 10 min of leaving the dock. They seem to be spread from
pebble beach to the west side of gedney island
. Great day for whale watching on the mystic sea.

Fred Lundahl flew over the known feeding spots at low tide today, but only found about a dozen
feeding pits at East Point
, Whidbey Island (near Holmes Harbor). It's still very early in the season, and the pits are not easy to see from the air, so there are probably others. Please let us know if you see any. The pits, often exposed at low tide, are about 3 feet deep and 4-5 feet across. Gray whales use their tongues as a piston to blast a jet of water into the mud to stir up the shrimp and other invertebrates. The muddy water is then sucked back into their massive mouths and expelled through the baleen plates. The tasty morsels are then swallowed.

1:15 -
From
Harborview Park in Everett
I can see
at least one gray whale
. Very hard to see without high powered binoculars. Looks like its going west between Hat island and Camano Island. It may have just gone into an inlet off the east side of hat island that I can't see from here.
