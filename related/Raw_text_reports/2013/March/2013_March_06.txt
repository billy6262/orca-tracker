Since the previous update on 4 March when the NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada was with K and L pods off Cannon Beach, Oregon, we have continued to follow them almost continuously up the Washington coast. They reached the northernmost point of their most recent round-trip to California this afternoon offshore of Cape Elizabeth, Washington before turning southwest and heading more offshore. We have been able to conduct small boat operations with the whales for the last two days and have been able to collect 3 prey samples and 7 fecal samples.

The latest track of the NOAA Cruise ship, with
K and L pods
, shows them about six miles
west of the Quinault River
- they had been heading north, but appear to have recently turned south again. You can follow the movements of the Bell Shimada at Ship Tracker.

"Spouting News" - LET THE SHRIMP HARVEST BEGIN - This morning our first
"gray" whale
of the season, right out front. From

8:15AM to
10:20AM
, took the slow train [walking the beach] from
Mariner's Cove; almost to Polnell Pt.
Gray was in constant feed mode/harvesting the ghost/sand shrimp. Most of the time, really in close; between 50' to 75' from the shoreline. Activity included the following:
a) Was not the only one observing, as curious seal trailed, young bald eagle flew by to check out, and single otter was feeding close to gray, possibly on scraps.
b) Gray was definately a right sided feeder which turned always to its right side to suction shrimp from sand.
c) Standing, on top of beach large rocks/high driftwood, noticed for first time what the surface swirling/splashing is all about. How the gray feeds. When gray tilts on its side, it will rock on the sandy bottom, rocking towards its stomach and then towards its back/spine. Evidently, In this way, with this movement, it creates the suction to harvest the shrimp from the sand.
d) An hour into the constant feed, was suddenly engulfed with a smell that was around a few minutes too long. Really ripe and much more pungent than typical sulfur smell I've caught down wind in a boat.
e) Gray would 'zig' out to deeper water 'zag' in towards shore; while slowly heading towards Polnell Pt. Always, heading south when going out to deeper water where drop off might have been. Mostly, feeding with its head in SW direction. Handful of times, feeding with head towards the shore due west. Not, to read into it too much, but, made me think of its inner workings/compass bearings. Finally, after 2 hours, I walked backed to Mariner's Cove; leaving the gray as breakfast was now turning into brunch. This was on an incoming tide, with high tide around 11AM.
