1:30-2 PM -
I watched
a single gray whale
feeding deep of the drop-off in front of our house south of the
Mabana Rd
, Camano Is. It fed in the same spot for a while, moved slightly north, then finally moved south out of sight. The low tides the past few days have shown a few feeding pits along the tide flats around Mabana, but I've only heard of one neighbor hearing/seeing a gray in close.

We watched
8 gray whales
today on Island Explorer 3 between

11:30 and
2:00
. Our naturalist Bart Rulon spotted the first three gray whales of the day. They were
#44, 56, and 383
and they were swimming close together northward between the south end of Whidbey Island and Hat Island. Then we spotted two more whales swimming along the shoreline of Hat Island. These two were
#22 and #723
and they did a couple of spy hops near shore! Then later while we headed back toward the dock we spotted gray whales
#49 and #53
just east of
Hat Island
. What a day!!!
