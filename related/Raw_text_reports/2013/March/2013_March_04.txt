Orca Sightings for March 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
K-pod and L-pod
continue to head north
along the Oregon coast
. The map shows movements since early this morning. L88 is the northern-most point on the map, but differences in tag programming are probably responsible for the gap between L88 and K25, rather than the two pods having split up. Posted for Brad Hanson, Northwest Fisheries Science Center
