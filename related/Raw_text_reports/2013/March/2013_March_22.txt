Orca Sightings for March 22, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
As dusk was setting in tonight, I happened to go outside in time to hear blowing out in the
Saratoga Passage, between the south end of Camano and Sandy Point south of Langley
. It was

7:45 pm
, and we saw
two gray whales
blowing several times in the same place; they seemed to be circling each other rather than traveling in any direction. They spent about ten minutes doing this, then moved to the northwest. They were close to shore. They blew so many times, it didn't appear they were feeding. Any idea what they were doing?

Was going to the bottom and scrounging for food, would stop and circle at times.
