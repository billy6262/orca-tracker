While walking around the southern tip of Whidbey Island at
2pm
I heard then spotted what were probably three gray whales heading towards
Possession Point buoy
. They were NE of the Possession Point buoy, about one hundred yards off shore. (lat 57deg 54min, long 122deg 121.5min). Each blow was separated by what felt like a minute, and there were three blows. They were
traveling SW
parallel the shore, but I think they were headed towards Edmonds, not Scatchet, there wasn't any fluke or fin displays. It almost looked like they were going to use the buoy as a mark and then head to Edmonds. Nice addition to a day of looking at bluff damage.
