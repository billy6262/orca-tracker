Yay! our first
Gray whale report from Hidden Beach, N of Greenbank
, Whidbey Island! I took the dog out for a short walk around 2 pm, and could HEAR a gray whale spouting close in. Went down to the neighbor's bluff, where I heard it several more times, but didn't get to see it - too close in to the bluff to see, but sounded like it was heading south toward Greenbank.

Finn Gatewood of Freeland reported a sighting of
a whale (likely a Gray) from the Clinton-Mukilteo ferry
this morning around

9:40 am
. She saw the flukes on the north side of the ferry, toward Hat/Gedney Island. She also thought she may have seen something out of the corner of her eye (possibly a 2nd Gray?) heading in the opposite direction.

K-pod and L-pod
are off the southern Washington coast, having crossed the
mouth of the Columbia River
early this morning. A report from Brad notes that combined on Saturday, Sunday and Monday they collected 8 different fecal samples and scale samples from 4 different predation events, so building up a good sample for examining diet. The map shows movements for the last ~24 hours, posted for Brad Hanson, Northwest Fisheries Science Center

The NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada, tracking L88 (Wave Walker), has been off of
North Beach Peninsula near Long Beach, WA,
all morning, where L112 Victoria/Sooke was found last February. They have zigged and zagged a couple of times, and per Marine Traffic, which is more current, it looks like they are headed south, at the moment.
