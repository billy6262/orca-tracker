Orca Sightings for March 8, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We received a call from Michelle Campbell reporting
a pod of orcas between Gig Harbor and Pt. Defiance at 5 pm
, heading south toward the Tacoma Narrows bridge. There was 1 male, and 7 - 8 orcas total- sounds like the pod observed coming in through Admiralty Inlet late Thursday night - where did they hide out all day?!

Cascadia Research conducted two days of offshore surveys out of Westport, WA on Friday and Saturday. On Friday, in coordination with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center cruise, we encountered
a large group of offshore killer whales near Gray's Canyon
. Photo IDs, biopsy, and prey samples were collected, and satellite tags were deployed to help elucidate movements and habitat use for this ecotype. This group did not include either of the individuals tagged in Southern California.

March 8th map of
K and L pods
, from the NWFSC: Since 6 March we have continued to try to follow K and L pods on the NOAA vessel Bell M. Shimada. On the evening of
6 March the whales were offshore of Cape Elizabeth, Washington
, heading southwest. By the morning of the 7th they were nearshore off the entrance of Willipa Bay before turning northwest. We spent the day following them in our small boat and collected several fecal samples. By
March 8 the whales were off the head of Gray's Canyon. The whales then moved inshore and were off of Gray's Harbor and northbound up the coast this evening. In the process of trying to resight K and L pods this morning we inadvertently ran into 30-40 offshore type killer whales.
