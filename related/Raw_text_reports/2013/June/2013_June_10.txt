Orca Sightings for June 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I called a few days ago about the possible
orca sighting in Port Orford, OR
. We were standing on the port dock around

8:30 pm
on Monday,
June 10, and saw what looked to be an orca. The markings on the whale were very similar to those on the flyer from which I got your number - black upper body with white sides/belly. As you can see from the attached photo, the fin is also similar to that described on the flyer. We tried to get a better shot of it, but were unable to. The whale came to the surface several times while we were on the dock - it looked to be heading out of the port and back towards the sea. It was a pretty amazing sight. (We are from Detroit, so not many whale sitings there, I'm afraid!)

On the
afternoon
of
June 10th a
group of T's
which included the
T065A's
and some of the
T075B's
were picked up by Carl on Island Explorer III near Deception Pass. We watched them go along the shoreline of Alan Island near Burrows and head north to Burrows Island. They were likely the same group that the Clipper saw in the morning off of Lagoon Pt.
