Veronica von Allworden called to report
at least 5 orcas, about 1/4 of the way between Langley and Camano Island
, milling and trending SE at approximately
6 pm
! They are really a stealthy pod - glad to hear they are still around ~
*

5:28 -
Pod of 5 now at south tip of
Camano Island
. To be clear they are in
Saratoga Passage
, at a guess a half mile off the South tip of Camano Island, moving up and down. I see 7 individuals. We are scoping from Whidbey East shore. At least one sail boat has stopped to observe. Several others have passed blissfully unaware.

Around

5:00 -
5:40
and still there. Seems like 5+ group. Stayed in same area for quite a while, diving for long periods, making themselves very mysterious.

Ts

Possession Point, south of Mukilteo

About

8:45 pm
on a peaceful evening in
Active Pass
, we were thrilled to have approximately
12 orcas
swim rapidly by us on the shore of
Galiano Island
. Some tail slaps, side swimming and quick spy hops.

This afternoon from

3:45-
4:15 PM
I watched
L-Pod
head south against a strong flood tide from
Land Bank's Westside Preserve on San Juan Island
. The numbers seemed right for all the L-Pod whales that have been around the last few days, though it was hard to get too many IDs as they were backlit in choppy water. I definitely saw the
L22s, L92, and L95
. No L11s as far as I could tell. Word was J-Pod was heading north towards Turn Point at the same time.
