What a way to kick off the new month!
L12's
return with
J pod
and there was a lot of excitement out there. We got to watch L41, L79 and L87 getting frisky with each other around
Battleship Island
(Haro Strait). Lots of action all over the place and to top it all off, we got to see "Big Momma" in the Strait of Georgia on the way home lunge feeding!
