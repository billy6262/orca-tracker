Orca Sightings for June 18, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Working in my boathouse at
Olympia Yacht Club last evening (6pm)
and heard the familiar "woosh" of air as a whale was taking a breath approx 20 feet from the open curtain. Did see a bit of a brown gray back as it dove with what appeared to be spinal cord type of bumps or surface bumps at the peak. Saw another gentleman on my walk to get a better view and he then saw the whale thru an open boathouse to the west of the yacht club moving north. We both walked to the northern most floats and saw the whale again surfacing (heading north about 200 ft away) and the tail appeared to be in the 5-10' in width at the flukes. Last sighting but others at the club had heard there was a whale in the neighborhood. I have seen a whales in this most southern part of Puget Sound and have experience with them in inland waters between here and Alaska, the open ocean and several parts of Baja California, Mexico.

MV Sea Hawk and Center for Whale Research are with a small pod of
Transients
just passing
Eagle Point
heading up island. Approximately five in the pod including a big male and a calf. The Transients are IDed as the
T036s
, including little
T036A2
, born in 2012. Also in the group were
T075 and her offspring T075A
, a male born in 1991. T075A was tagged in Southeast Alaska in 2011 and hasn't been encountered in these waters in seven years!
San Juan Outfitters

We had an amazing encounter with the
T65As and T75Bs
just north of Parks Bay. They spent over 30 minutes trying to get these seals. The seals survived this encounter.

We had the
T065A's with T075B, 075B1, and T075C
in the
morning
. They were north west bound north of
Pt. Wilson
. In the
afternoon
the rest of the
T075's (T075 and T075A)
along with the
T036A's
were found making a kill near Whale Rocks. They continued north west inside Salmon Bank towards Eagle Point while the
T065A's and T075B group went north up San Juan Channel
.

Spent time with
L25, Ocean Sun and L41, Mega, off Victoria
. They were quickly heading out and towards
Race Rocks
. The two made time however, to goof off, with Ocean Sun seemingly chasing a fish out from under the boat and over towards Mega where the two of them thrashed as they took it down.
