The
T65As
were in
Fulford Harbor (Salt Spring Island)
today, a long trip but well worth it, and we didn't even notice the rain!

Five orca
were in
Fulford Harbour, Salt Spring Island
for approximately one hour today. At

3:30 PM
tThey were swimming southward toward Isabella Point. The group seemed to consist of females and juveniles. I assume that they were transients. Even though they were followed by about ten whale watching boats, they appeared to be in a relaxed swimming mode.
