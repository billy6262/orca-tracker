So cool. We went out to
Constance Bank
and saw a humpback feeding, and then on the way back home Ivan Reiff had another
humpback
. Same one we had last month, and the same from Saturday. He/she was very active when he hit the currents, with lots of fluking and then he began to roll in the kelp and slapping his pecs with streaming kelp! Awesome!
