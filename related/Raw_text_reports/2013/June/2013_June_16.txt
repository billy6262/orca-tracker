Orca Sightings for June 16, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:10 - 4-5 orcas are off Friday Harbor
. Brad Hanson was coming in to Friday Harbor on the ferry, just about to make the last turn into the dock, when he saw them in San Juan Channel.
*
We watched this pair of Orca's [these
appear to be Risso's dolphins
] on Father's Day for over 45 min! They swam all over
Taylor Bay
. This shot was taken as they were headed around Johnson's Point from our boat.
