Orca Sightings for June 23, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mike Lorden was waiting for the moon to set at
Ebey's Landing on Whidbey Island
in the wee hours of the morning
before 3 am
and saw and heard
at least 2 orcas
blowing and breaching. Too dark for photos obviously.

5:38 pm - The gray whale at Elger Bay
(Camano Island) was here only 15 minutes at the high tide of the day. It seemed to feed 5-6 times and swam around the rest. It didn't feed like the other whales that visit here. There is lots of sand shrimp, but it was in and out, and did not try the most common and best spots. It surfaces about 10' off shore (no other whale has done that) and at one point was swimming directly at shore fast when it was only 100' out. Most other whales swim parallel. I felt like it was frantic, semi-feeding activity, and certainly not efficient. Definitely a smaller whale maybe 20-25 feet.
