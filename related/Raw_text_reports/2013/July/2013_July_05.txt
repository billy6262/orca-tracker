Orca Sightings for July 5, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Report from the whale centre in Tofino BC that the
T069s were off Hot springs near Tofino BC Canada
. The T069s are very common along the West coast of Vancouver Island and usually tag along with the T041s and T065As. - Josh McInnes

Seven orcas, the
T137s and T36As
were found headed north through
Active Pass
, and they were half way up the Galiano shore line by the time we met up with them. They were surfacing in a fairly strait line and not changing course as Ts are wont to do. I believe they made two kills while we were with them, due to sudden milling behaviour, followed shortly by bursts of activity (tail slaps, a surface lunge or two, and a series of spectacular breaches by 11 year old male T137A). The two youngsters in the group (T36A2 and T137D, both are approximately a year old, both born in 2012) were quite rambunctious with each other, which is always charming to watch.
