============================================================

. in the
morning

The Center for Whale Research and others will confirm that indeed
all 82 wild orcas, of J-K-L pods came in
. A bit foggy passing Cattle Point Lighthouse, then
orcas off of one of their favorite dining places- False Bay
, chattering away! They seemed intent on foraging for King-Chinook salmon- their primary food, as they milled about with directional changes. The clan was spread out over 7 miles and up into Haro Strait, (they can vocalize and communicate about 10 miles away from each other!) Sightings of
two Minke whales
out at
Salmon Bank
, a Stellar Sea Lion on Whale Rocks, Harbor Seals young and old taking advantage of the strong 8'+ new moon flooding tide in Cattle Pass. - Caroline Armon, On-Board Tours

Yesterday was pretty amazing! Lunging
Minkes in the AM
and the
Super Pod in the PM
. FINALLY! We were seeing
Ks for the first time in months
and we hadn't seen Js for about a month. We left part of them headed north toward the Fraser River. In terms of sightings, May and June and early July were the worst in memory, but maybe that's the norm. We have been studying Resident Orcas for such a short time. We ego-centric humans! We study a species for a few years of their behavior, out of the thousands of years that they have been in these waters, and we think we know everything there is to know about them. - Capt. Jim Maya
*
We had a lovely view from the shore of about
20 orcas heading north up Navy Channel at Dinner Point (Canadian Gulf Islands) between
8:30 and
9:30 pm
. We were over 1/2 mile away. We believe they continued north up Trincomali Channel but may have turned into Active Pass. We saw lots of blowing, several tail splashes and several fins flap with loud noise on the water, and one breach. Several ferries and recreational boaters and a couple of Canadian navy boats in the area that would have got an even closer view. - Linda Jones, Okemos MI

Eagle Point (San Juan Is.)
right now...One went east, and a couple of others are lolling in place at the point. - Alex Shapiro
