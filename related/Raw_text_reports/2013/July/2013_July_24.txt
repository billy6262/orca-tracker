Orca Sightings for July 24, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A stellar encounter with the boys and mom of the
T101A's and 102
! After 4 hours of searching we finally found them coming into
Desolation Sound (northern Georgia Strait)
by Mary Pt! They were split into 2 of 2....101&102 together...101A&B off on the Cortes Isl shore. They took one seal there, then all 4 got together for another, then the celebratory Spyhops occurred! We were happy to find these guys for the CR fleet. -Nick Templeman
