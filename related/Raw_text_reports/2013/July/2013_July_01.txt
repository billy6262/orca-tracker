Orca Sightings for July 1, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Off
Middle Bank
, we, the Ocean Magic II encountered, in very rough water, a group of
3 females and this big Male, who was ID's as T 072
. It looked like he was travelling with the T 75's. We lost them in the fog that was drifting in as they headed south west. He is believed to be a very rare visitor to these waters. - Marie O'Shaughnessy, Orca -Magic, Prince of Whales.

We spent a very warm Canada day on the hunt for cetaceans in the Salish Sea, and by a very lucky stroke got to spend time with
4 transients off Middle Bank
(Strait of Juan de Fuca). The wind and waves were picking up which cut our encounter short, and these apex predators were certainly keeping us on our toes, exhibiting extreme zig zagging behaviour, heading south for a few short breaths then down for another 4.5 minutes only to be heading in the opposite direction north 1/4 mile away. In addition, they kept a steady pace of 7 knots through the 2-3 foot (and building) seas. I managed to identify the group as
T72 with the T73As
(a mother with two offspring). Not sure if this is correct, as I never got confirmation, but if it is indeed them, what a treat! This group is not often encountered in the Salish Sea. - Tasli Shaw
