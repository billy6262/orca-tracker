Orca Sightings for July 23, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
T20 and T21
ended up hunting in the
Cactus Islands
. This is one of the coolest places to see whales! -Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watch
*
Skipper Mallard along with the Vancouver Ocean Magic were on scene with
a lone minke
whale in
Hughes Channel
between James and Sidney Island. By midday we had received reports of a group of
transient killer whales at the southeast end of San Juan Island heading north into San Juan Channel
. Skipper Matt initially found the two transients,
T20 and T21 in Griffin Bay
just south of Friday Harbour on the east coast of San Juan Island. These two transients are very familiar to us, as we saw the mother and son together frequently at the beginning of the season.
