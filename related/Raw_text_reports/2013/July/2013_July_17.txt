3:47 pm - Six or seven transient orca whales are out at Hein Bank
now and have been since this morning. They have been taking turns diving down in kind of a tag team action. Most of the whale watch boats with these whales think they have killed or are killing a Minke whale, but there isn't any evidence in the form of blood in the water or pieces of blubber floating. It wouldn't be the first time transient orca whales have killed a Minke in this area. Jury's still out on whether it was a Minke whale that was being eaten. - Deer Harbor Charters

We were with them for a while this
afternoon
(Mystic Sea) - what a surprise. No scraps at all to be seen on the surface, no deep dives, and a lot of back and forth surface action. A few gulls were hovering, so there must have been some food for them. The whales had been in the same area for more than an hour before we arrived, and still there when we left. I believe they were the T037As and Bs (?) - Jill Hein
