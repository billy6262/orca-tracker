I always love it when the whales join at dinner time! At

7:45 pm a large group of whales were porpoising towards Eagle Cove
. At least two pods! They paused for several impressive breaches, cartwheels and tail lobbing, then continued north, close together and close to the shore! Absolutely breathtaking! - Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill

There are really no words to describe this incredible afternoon. What did we see? Everything! Members from
all 3 Southern Resident pods ( J,K,L)
were in a curious and rather playful state. Multiple breaches, spyhops, tailslaps, rolling all over each other! What a pleasure it was to see these images. - Steveston Seabreeze Adventures

So the whales were heading out to sea, we thought. In they came at sunset! This
matriline foraged briefly at Land Bank
then went south. All the rest sped north past Lime Kiln. And thank you, Melisa Pinnow, for the fast ID of Shachi J19 even with my icky cell phone snap of my very dark camera LCD! - Meg McDonald

I thought for sure when I left
Ks and Js at
4:00
that they were headed west, but they came back in. Late in my afternoon trip I got the first pic,
Mike and a minke

Two minkes
started porpoising away from him...Amazing. Never seen anything like this before...Mike was headed west south of Hein Bank... - Capt. Jim Maya
