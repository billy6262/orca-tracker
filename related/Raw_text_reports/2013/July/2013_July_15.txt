Orca Sightings for July 15, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
8:59 - off the pier near Madrona Way
or the Coupeville Wharf in town. - Denise Reynolds
*

8:13 pm - Transients off Whidbey in Penn Cove
...off the pier!
4-5 orcas
, one visibly larger. They were mid-cove out in front of the Coupeville pier headed west. Went down and we never saw them again. It was very exciting to finally spot them from our deck. - Patti Goethals Rowlson
*
Sounds like the larger group has separated and
traveling up both sides of Whidbey
. There were
at least 20
when we first saw them a few days ago west of Shilshole making a kill. It was amazing! - Renee Ramirez
*

6:30 pm -
Stephanie Raymond from the Victoria Clipper called to report
a pod of 5 Transient orcas
(no adult males)
between Point No Point and Possession Pt.
heading south. Not sure if this is the same pod seen earlier between Seattle/Bainbridge, or the rest of the 17 orcas that were all in Puget Sound together on the 13th.
*
At
1830
this evening saw
3 orcas a hundred yards off shore of Polnell Point
(across from Oak Harbor) on the east side of Whidbey Island. A nearby neighbor said there were 6-7 orcas. Lost sight of them at
1845
as they rounded the southerly tip of Polnell Point, the eastern most point of Crescent Harbor, north up Saratoga Passage from Baby Island. Polnell Point is almost as far north as the north end of Camano Island...but due west since it is part of Whidbey Island. Not sure if they headed into Crescent Harbor, or perhaps south in Saratoga Passage. - Steve Rothboeck, Oak Harbor
*
"Spouting News" MARINERS COVE/SKAGIT BAY TRANSIENTS. Was with my brother out on the water;
off Mariners Cove
. In a place we were meant to be at

4:30PM
on this hot summer day. Glanced, out aways, [totally unexpected] and there they were. A quick blink, yes, Orcas, heading northeast towards Strawberry Point. On the move and then a sudden left turn, wala, no longer on the move. Circling, going back & forth staying in one area.
Maybe 9 Transients
to a dozen, with a big guy with big dorsal fin. Within 20 minutes they all headed really close into shore, in shallow water. Many/all of them 'shoulder to shoulder' so to speak, where lots of splashing occurred for close to 10 minutes. Could they have trapped a school of salmon [or a seal?] in maybe 10 to 15 feet deep water max? Could go on and on for the hour and a half we were treated to/observing these wolves of the sea. Dozens of tail lobs/splashing from many, especially, the smaller ones. A number times periscoping, with head vertically out of the water. Numerous, breaches; including, one that breached 3 times in a roll. Many Mariners Cove members watching from the jetty and shoreline. Little past 6PM, they headed southwest towards Polnell Point. Still, breaching, tail lobbing, and cavorting, in boisterous fun. Totally in their element, with the Olympic Mountains high over head in the distance. But maybe not as 'high' as experiencing these whales in action. - Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor Whidbey Island
*

3:57 pm -
leaving the
T30's in Cresent Harbor
heading south. So those of you south of Oak Harbor in Saratoga Passage should be seeing the orcas come by again soon! - Michael P Colahan, Island Explorer3
*

1:42 -
I found them! I was so excited and screamed so loud I scared my kids and they started crying. It was pretty much the most exciting experience of my life! Watched them off and on from the lookout point on
Seaplane Base
for close to an hour. Going Northeast, maybe? They appeared to be moving really slowly when we first (finally!) saw them, then they picked up speed. There was a boat that was staying with them the entire time, I assumed it was some sort of research team. They were closer to Camano Island when I reluctantly drove away. THANK YOU for keeping us all informed about sightings!! - Krista McVay Lee

11:45 am -
Billy Wind called to report the
pod of orcas were in Oak Harbor
.
*
Between
11:00 and
11:30 AM
we saw
a pod of orcas
go by...we were pretty much straight west
off Magnolia
sailing southbound. In the picture you can see a navy sub being escorted southbound by the Coast Guard to Bremerton on the far west side. Seemed to be maybe three to four adults and one small one, heading north, mostly just traveling but stopped once to 'play' for a few seconds, then continued on. I know the photo is not much help, my camera just couldn't keep up with them! :) - Pam
*
11am -
Sailing into the racecourse from
Oak Harbor to Penn Cove
we saw a big old orca party...breaches, zoomin around, flips, more breaches...looks like the hunt was on. Not the first sighting but biggest and best. - Mike Cain
*
Sammye Kempbell of Coupeville called to report the pod of
7 Biggs orcas at the entrance to Penn Cove
, near the green buoy at

10:55 am
, heading NE toward Oak Harbor. Sammye called again to say there is a young orca in the pod. This sounds like the same pod that was there yesterday -
the T30s (male is T30A), and T75s.
*
Marie Waterman of WSF called to report a pod of
3 orcas heading north
, seen at

9:55
by the ferry Tacoma on their
Seattle - Bainbridge Island Run
.
*
I'm sure you already know this but I'll tell you anyway:
two Orcas crossed the bow (Seattle end) of the M/V Tacoma
this morning around
0950
. Possibly two miles northwest of Alki. Swimming together and headed northwesterly. - Larry Brown
*
Spotted
two small Orcas
moving fast just off of
Restoration Pt. on Bainbridge
Island Monday at
9am
. They only surfaced twice that I saw and there didn't appear to be any other whales in the area. I was the captain of a boat taking 200 kids to camp so we couldn't hang out very long (plus we were right in the middle of the southbound traffic lane when we saw them). - Paul Mooselips Dudley
*
A group of neighbors watched for about a 45 minute period
a pod of Orcas feeding in a spot about 1 mile south of Race Lagoon
on the East side of Whidbey Island about 500 yards off the beach.
Several large Orcas and 2-3 medium sized and 1 or two smaller whales.
Total size of pod 5-7 in total. They were circling and diving all in the same area for the time we observed them, thus appeared to be feeding. - Bill Wiegand
*

8:46 am - Two young orcas
spotted in the middle of Puget Sound off of
Alki beach
. - Regan Timm
*
Don't know if it was reported, but saw
a small pod from the Vashon water taxi
just north of the
Vashon ferry dock
this morning around

8:20am
. Not sure which direction they were headed. - Carolyn Barr
*
Three of
four humpbacks
we saw. - Capt. Jim Maya
*
Tony reports
one Humpback whale in Malaspina Strait, BC
, traveling west/NW at

7:10 pm
.
*
A
minke in the Hein Bank
area lunges through a bait ball of schooling fish. - Marcie Callewaert
