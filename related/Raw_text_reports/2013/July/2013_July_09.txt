Orca Sightings for July 9, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around

15:00
, we met up with a group of
L pod whales 2NM north of East Point
. In attendance were the
L55s, L72-L95-L105, L90-L92, and the L47s
. Missing were the L12s, L22s, L84, L87, and L88, who were on the San Juan Island west side at the time. I did not manage to account for the L54s or L53 in this group, but I might have just missed them in my photos, or perhaps they were with the group of
Js and Ks making their way south down Rosario
at the time this encounter was taking place. Its interesting to see the social dynamics and the "whos with who" during times when all three pods are in the same area. They were surfacing mostly as one large group (beautiful!!), making a slow pace in the current between Patos and East Point. They began to spy hop and mill for a brief period, as if a decision was being made as to which direction to go. Rather than carry on up toward the Fraser River, they all turned south east toward Rosario, where the Js and Ks were. Great encounter, a real treat to have these whales back in the area. - Tasli Shaw

So cool to see
K pod back in the Salish Sea
, spending time with
J pod
. Granny (yay) was leading the pack, heading south from the coal docks - in mill-pond like seas! Too many breaches to count, tail lobs and even a double spy-hop. Hope they stay around for a while! - Jill Hein
