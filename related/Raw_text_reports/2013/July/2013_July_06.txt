Orca Sightings for July 6, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a
Minke in the group of killer whales on our
5:30
Sunset Whale Watch Tour that seemed to be having somewhat of an identity crisis. It was
traveling with the L-Pod members L-22, L-79, and L-89
. It became clear when the Minke whale jumped clear out of the water in a breach that this whale was having some serious misidentification issues. I have NEVER seen a Minke whale breach and seeing one breach is incredibly rare! My fellow naturalist, Aimee, and I were literally hopping for joy! - Heather, Naturalist, San Juan Safaris

L22s off of South Beach
, San Juan Island, headed toward Salmon Bank. - Capt. Jim Maya

Ken Balcomb reports the
L22s are on the west side of San Juan Island

I wanted to report
a humpback whale
that surfaced very near our sailboat in
Georgia Strait
when we were passing the outer Ballenas Island around

1:30 pm.
Just one. We were traveling south on a downwind sail and had been on the same tack for perhaps an hour. It came up just enough to see the fin and part of its back, paused for a moment, then sank again. So although it was uncomfortably close to us there was no chance to identify it in any way It is possible that it had surfaced some minutes earlier...we heard an odd gushing but in all the wind and waves it is hard to be sure it wasn't just the dinghy. This is the second time we've seen a humpback in Georgia Strait. Last summer on
August 12 around 10 am while crossing from Comox to Pender Harbour in our sailboat we were on a convergent path with a humpback that also was going north. We were about a third of the way between Comox and Pender Harbour, north and west of Texada. We saw it surface from a distance several times, and when we realized it was getting close we tacked away and didn't see it any more. It was heading north in a beeline. -Gail Kucera
