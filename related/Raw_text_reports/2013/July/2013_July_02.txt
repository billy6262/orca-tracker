Orca Sightings for July 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
T075's and T77's in Haro Strait.
- Mark Malleson
*
L89 - Solstice off Eagle Point around noon
. - SpringTide Whale Tours
*
Today the wind threatened again! But we got lucky and caught up with the
L12s on AND the T75s (Residents and Transients in the same trip!)
off the
west side of San Juan Island
before the wind hit. Incredible afternoon on the water with some wonderful and adventurous guests. - Western Prince Whale Watching & Wildlife Tours
*
Whales
[orcas] off of Granny's Cove and Eagle Cove (south side of San Juan Island),

9:00-
9:30pm
, heading north, extremely close to shore, lots of breaching including an adult female and baby breaching in unison multiple times! Spectacular!

9:08 pm -
Large group of whales approaching Eagle Cove, close to shore, heading north, breaching and spy hopping! - Lodie Laurieanne Gilbert Budwill
*
L Pod (well, the L12s)
came back in so this morning's trip was wonderful relief. Then the afternoon trip had not only L Pod Resident whales, but
T75s (?) Transient orcas too!
Nicely played orcas, nicely played! - John Boyd
*
Caught up with the
T75 and T77 matrilines
going north west near
Beaumont Shoal around
16:30
. They treated us to a slow and steady pace of surfacing as a group 5-6 times then diving for 4.5-5 minutes. It was a beautiful afternoon, with calm seas and golden light which seemed to illuminate each breath the whales took.
Just as a fun sidenote, the L12s were in relatively close proximity to these Biggs. The resident whales were between False Bay and Eagle Point on San Juan Island, and the Biggs were just a few miles off shore from them at one point. Yeahhh good day - Tasli Shaw
*

9:05 -
Just got home form
Mukilteo
, after waiting for an hour, was about the leave when I saw
blows out towards Whidbey
. A group of about 5, no mature males that I could see; looked like all females and immature, younger ones. Kept a steady northward pace, just to the Whidbey side of mid channel. Watched them until they were
past Clinton
, headed towards Saratoga Passage - Pam Ren
*

8:30 pm -
My sister just spotted them just
south of Clinton
going north approaching the Ferry Ln., Midchannel closer to the Clinton side. - Kathy Wahl
*

7:01 -
Just found those
Ts again in Possession Sound
, heading north. Looks like the same ones we saw at Possession Point this morning--Maybe T50s? - Stephanie Raymond
*

3:46 -
The Victoria Clipper just saw the
transients between Edmonds and Apple Tree Point
, middle of the sound. There was some tail lobbing happening. - Kaarin Jacobson
*

1:40 -
Capt. Korie onboard the Olympus just left the same group of
whales at Possession Point
again moving east! - Sarah Hanke
*

10:15 -
Maya of the WA State Ferries just called to relay a report from the
Mukilteo/Clinton ferry
that a
pod of orcas was seen one mile north of the ferry lane
, headed for Hat Island.
*

8:55 -
Stephanie Raymond, naturalist on the Victoria Clipper, is with
transients
again. This time five Ts are
off Possession Point
on the south end of Whidbey Island. They aren't traveling much, mostly milling in the same area for the past 20 minutes, so they could head east into Possession Sound or west up Admiralty Inlet, or south into Puget Sound.
