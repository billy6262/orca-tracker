Orca Sightings for April 30, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A report had been received early in the morning that
T020 & T021
had been spotted near
Constance Bank
& then again in
Oak Bay
by Mark Malleson. Despite a large search in the morning the Orcas were not picked up until later in the day by Mark south of
Discovery Island
moving North towards the Chain Islets. We left them just exiting Baines Channel heading into
Haro Strait around 4pm
yesterday. Great day on the water:)

At

9:00 am
I watched
T020 and T021
swim northbound through
Oak Bay
....likely same animals reported at

7:00 AM
east bound north of Constance.

Just spotted
Grey Whale from Edmonds-Kingston ferry
- just off Edmonds ferry dock at

4:45
, swimming south.
Gina Vigna
Note: This was about the same time a humpback (or two) were seen from that ferry, so this may have been a humpback
.

We haven't had as many this year so I was doubly excited to see
a gray whale
this morning just before
8 a.m.
In front of
Witter Beach (south of Langley)
feeding and heading south towards the ferry.

Just a note of sighting a whale by
Golden Gardens park
, headed south past Shilshole marina about
7pm
. I didn't see a dorsal fin, which made me think it was another type of whale, and it was really big. I also did not see any sign of it being part of a pod.

6:33 pm - Humpback
just swam past
Carkeek Park
, southbound, VERY close to shore. Should be passing Golden Gardens now. Calling loudly. Heard them from shore. The few times I saw a whale surface, it was smooth-backed with a clear and definite dorsal fin towards the tail. The audible call above the surface was what caused my friend and I to look and see the hump and the tail. I just watched some videos of humpbacks trumpeting above the surface and it is exactly what I heard. Maybe we have some grays out there today too, but the ones past Carkeek must have been humpbacks!

I also saw the same whale - at about

6:25
, from the beach at Blue Ridge (south of
Carkeek Park
, north Seattle) - very close to shore, southbound, calling, blowing. Not sure if it was a gray or humpback.

Around
5pm
my wife and I were at Marina Beach in
Edmonds
when we saw
a humpback whale
(possibly grey) suddenly surface not even 40 feet off the shore. It took two breaths before making a tail dive. We saw it surface and tail dive a few more times as it headed south towards Richmond Beach.

My husband saw them from the

4:45 Edmonds-Kingston
ferry today.

Note: It's possible these were gray whales, as reported at the same place and time.
