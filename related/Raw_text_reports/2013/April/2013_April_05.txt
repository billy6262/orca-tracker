Orca Sightings for April 5, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around
noon
I saw
4 to 5 orcas
in front of our cabin on
Keats island
(about 15 miles NW of Vancouver BC) coming out of Collingwood Channel into Barfleur Passage. There was a bigger orca fin a distance away and it stayed closer to the Paisley islands. The rest of them headed over to Keats island and spent some time in a cove near Pebble Beach where they appeared to be eating. There was
a baby orca among them
. I was able to see the light patch behind the fin of one and also the fluke of one when it dove into the water. They frolicked for a while between Preston island and Keats island. The distant orca had a less curvy tail. Last year we saw three orcas that passed right in front of our cabin.

In the morning I came across the
T101's at Kelp Reef
heading north. They continued north and went through Active Pass in the afternoon. On my way back to Victoria I came across the
T018's
also north bound a mile south of the west entrance to
Active Pass
.
