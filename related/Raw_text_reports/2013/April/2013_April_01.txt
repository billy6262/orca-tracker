New rercord for me...
5 gray whales
in one sighting ( at least). A couple of quick spyhops, several pec fins, and one full tail fluke show. Pretty good evening all in all! Alverson Blvd is the street you want for the part of Legion Park that has the lookout over that area. Great view of Priest Pt and the river delta.
