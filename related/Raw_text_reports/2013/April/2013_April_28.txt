Orca Sightings for April 28, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
At approximately

11:50
we encountered
a juvenile humpback
in the
Strait of Georgia
, a few miles off the south-east
Galiano Island
shore. Holy wow did he/she ever impress us! After "mugging" our boat (making a series of close passes, and rolling on his/her side to look at us), a series of about 5 consecutive breaches began followed by numerous pec slaps and barrel roles. After the rush of activity, he/she began a more-or-less straight foward dive sequence in a NE direction up the Strait of Georgia. Interesting behavior indeed, perhaps playfulness on the part of this young whale? Or something else? It was one of those encounters that makes you ponder if there was some type of communication being transmitted somehow.

We were very fortunate to join in on
a humpback
sighting in
Georgia Strait
, even though it meant backtracking for us. The humpback had been located east of the midpoint of Galiano Island, and was meandering northwesterly when we arrived on scene. This individual appears to be the same humpback sighted on Apr 13, 2013 and possibly on
May 11, 2012. It is not yet listed in the published HB catalogue. It appeared to be foraging along the tide lines, and some lunges were observed at the surface. After a period of foraging/feeding, the humpback began milling around, often surfacing in relatively close proximity to the stopped boats. Then, to everyone's surprise and delight, the humpback began a series of breaches, some completely clear of the water, others looking more like travelling spyhops. After at least 10 breaches, the ballet section began, with pec waves and slaps, some very graceful! The percussion section kicked in next, with a series of fluke waves and slaps, followed by a beautiful back breach. After all that activity, the humpback settled right back down to millling and travelling, and we were on our way with a load of astonished passengers and 2 very happy crew members! We deemed this to be the best-ever humpback enounter in Georgia Strait.

I did not know who to send this to as it was my first time seeing a whale from land. I was at the park by the
Mukilteo ferry
, in the southern parking lot looking the water. While I was looking south, I saw the first
spout
then a tail fluke. A few mins later, I saw it again, or I assume it was the same one, the second time was closer and almost straight out from where I was standing, it was moving north. No spout, did see the back, no Dorsal fin that I could see, then fluke. Did not see it again, and only saw the one. Gray or Humpback? I am very lucky and humble to see such a marvelous creature.

You probably saw a gray whale.
