Orca Sightings for April 16, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were with
T49Bs and T65As
again and they were in the midst of a seal banquet near
Moresby Island
. We saw them pick off at least 2 or 3 while we were there midday - lots of activity and excitement, and scrambling seals! The whales were rolling, tail slapping and charging all over the place. They were circling the area but heading north as we left. In a couple shots you can see one of the kills and another has a close crop of T49B with a piece of blubber in her mouth as she surfaces.

We encountered the
T49Bs and T65As
foraging near Sheep Island (south of
Moresby Island
in the Gulf Islands) where many of the rocks were covered in harbor seals.
T49A2
was in the mix. I do not have any positive IDs on any other T49As though. We watched the orcas expertly patrol close to the rocks and we saw the water turn red with seal blood once, though I believe they made two kills during our observation of them. The two youngest in the group,
T49B2 and T65A4
, broke away from the others to play (with seal scraps perhaps?) at one point, but quickly rejoined the group and the 7 of them continued on their way toward the Comet/Gooch Island area. So fabulous!
