Orca Sightings for April 17, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had a
single large Orca
surface once about 20' away from the boat about
9pm
Wednesday. It was eastbound off
Chain Islands (Oak Bay, Victoria)
. It's hard to see black whales at night!

We saw
10-12 orcas
together traveling through
Spieden Channel
yesterday, heading north at about

1:00pm
. We saw a female and her 2 offspring -- one baby-- who came close by as we floated. The others we saw from about 300 yds away about 20 min prior. This was between Spieden Island and Flat Rock Island. Amazing!
