There are some nice
vocals
from apparently a
big group of Ts
. There were 28 counted in Georgia St. today, so this must be them. That's almost 2 hours at Lime Kiln and they're still going strong.

I love days that go like this: "We don't have any orca reports..." 5 minutes off the dock, "Ooo, we have an orca report! Oh...they are really far away... But WAIT they are coming our way..." 10 minutes later, "Ah darn, they are going the wrong direction. Too far away..." 5 minutes later, "Oh look! Seals!" 5 minutes later, "Oooo! Another orca report and they are coming our direction!!! Oh...but they are really far away..." Meanwhile, pedal to the metal...gonna try to make it! 30 minutes later- shoot through
Active Pass
, but still 5 miles from orcas... "Hey wait a second...what was THAT?? Did you see that???! I saw that!
ORCAS
!!!!!!!" Watch orcas for 10 minutes, and then look over shoulder to see
MORE ORCAS!
And then
ANOTHER group of orcas!
Well...holy sh
*
t
*
smiles all around

:) (I believe the final count of transient orcas in the area today was
28?? We had the T18's, T65A's, and T49A's
[I think] - the usual suspects, but very glad to see them!)

We watched the
T018's, T049B's, T065A's, and T049C
go through
Active Pass
in the afternoon. They continued south down Swanson Channel.

Several family
groups of transient orcas
were sighted in
Georgia Strait
today. We first located the
T10's, then T63
traveling with the
T101
big boys, and finally the
T100's, T101's and T102
. The latter group was last seen at approx
1330
hrs heading generally northward towards
Thrasher Rock
. Nice treat to have so many T's in one area!

On a late afternoon cruise from Langley (aboard Mystic Sea) Saturday, we found
several gray whales
, 3 on the south east side of
Hat Island
, and 2 closer to
Tulalip
. Not ideal conditions for photos, but we had positive ID's on
#53, #383
and I believe we had
#22
also.

4:30 - Whale off Polnell Shores
.
Mary Jo Conibear-Lohrenz

We just saw what we think is a whale in
between Hope and Steamboat Island in the Puget Sound (north end of Saratoga Passage)
. Seemed to big for a dolphin. Straight slightly curved medium sized dorsal fin dark almost black in color with grey body. Fin seemed to sit back further than an Orca. Maybe 15 feet in length.
Holly House
Sounds like possibly a minke whale?

We received a report from Randy Johnson in California reporting observing
8 orcas approximately 4 miles straight out from Noyo Harbor
(Ft. Bragg
CA
), in 378 - 400' of water.
