Orca Sightings for April 23, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Finally get to see
a whale
from my office at the Norwester at
Naval Air Station Whidbey Island
. It was at
3PM
(23 Apr) and appeared to be a single whale of some good size but
not a grey whale
. It was a good
2/3 of the way between Whidbey and Lopez island
and there appeared to be a Coast Guard ship lingering in the shipping straits, perhaps enjoying a look at the activity as well? I saw no fin that would indicate it was an Orca whale but it had some clear white spots on black body like an Orca? It did show one smaller dorsal during one of the breeches. It had made a kill or there was some confluence of fish on the surface such that it drew gulls and other sea birds to the spot. From a distance one could see the birds teeming and the whale coming 1-3 feet out of the water over a period of some 20 minutes then it moved in a Northerly direction, roughly in the shipping channel. I hope more to come!
