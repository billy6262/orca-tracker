Orca Sightings for April 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Whale of the Day (actually the ONLY whale of the day...)
Patch #49
seen from "Mystic Sea" off
Gedney Island
through the rain and mist. The mist may have hidden a few more gray whale blows, but Patch ruled the waves as far as we could see. A calm day with glassy sea conditions and no wind - so no whale breath blowing down-wind. People don't know what they missed... Sandra Pollard (Naturalist on Mystic Sea)
