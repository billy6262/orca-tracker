Orca Sightings for May 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
A gray (Eschrichtius robustus) whale
has recently been
photographed in Walvis Bay, Namibia
. This is the first record we are aware of for the species in the South Atlantic or Southern Hemisphere and likely represents one of, if not the longest movements of any mammal. The animal has been
seen around the bay by marine tour operators since the 04
May 2013
. A more detailed back story and photographs confirming species identify are available for viewing on the Namibian Dolphin Project blog.

A
humpback
was traveling north very close to the beach at
Marina Park, Edmonds around
6:00pm.
It was moving pretty fast for a humpback ;)
