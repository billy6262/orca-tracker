Orca Sightings for May 19, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
On our last day of Marine Naturalist Training we were treated to a field trip aboard the Odyssey. On our return, Capt. Pete spotted
a minke at
10:00
am traveling northbound in
San Juan Channel
. Calm waters made this minke easy to see as it continued surfacing every 4-5 minutes in a zig-zag pattern, two times very near our boat much to the thrill of us all. We left the minke about
10:40 am still making it's way northbound.

I just saw
2 Orcas near pt. defiance
heading towards the
Narrows bridge
. They were following a tug boat pulling wood.

There were
three orcas
, one male for sure. This was the first time that I have been able to spot them all the way down here in the
deep south of Puget Sound
! There are too many long inlets and so few public places to get a good open view from shore when they finally do make it down this far. It must have been my lucky day today, though!..further south in
Totten Inlet (
12:20 pm
). This one breached about 10 times in a row!

Julie from Olympia called to report seeing
3 orcas in Totten Inlet
this afternoon, Sunday, at
3 pm
. She was in a canoe traveling from Mud Bay to Totten Inlet, up around the Steamboat Island area. The orcas were first heading SW, then turned and headed back toward the NE. One of the orcas was displaying what is often referred to as a "sea snake" or "pink floyd" - possibly a little mating or playing around going on?!
*
We saw them too! They were down in
Totten near Gallagher Cove
, then they headed north out of the inlet and around the top of Hope Island. Appeared to be one adult and two smaller ones.

Magic moments for boat and land-based whale watchers as members of
J pod
foraged along the
west side of San Juan Island
. Although the whales were well spread out, two spending time happily together and sharing a freshly caught salmon were
Hy'Shqa (J37) and her son, J49
- such a delight to see this little one has made it safely through the winter.

2:30 PM -
As I was sitting on a rock, a pair came by first, one a large male and this one; I've identified the large male as Blackberry, but need help with this one. This one tail lobbed RIGHT in front of me and it's an experience I'll never forget. Sorry if this is not the best ID photo... Later, a group of 8+ orcas came by. The whole experience was great! Taken at
Lime Kiln

We had just begun our goodbyes at our graduation ceremony for the Spring 2013 Marine Naturalists Training at the Whale Museum when I received texts from both Pam and Ed that
J pod was on the hydrophones
. We cleared the museum pretty fast, making our way to the west side of the island where we spent the next four hours with J pod & L87 as they partook in the west side shuffle. First planted ourselves at
Land Bank
watching them spread out in small groups a couple of miles apart heading southbound. They stalled at Hannah Heights and a bit south for over an hour when a breach seemed to signal the move northward. Orca and humans alike made their way back to Land Bank where youngsters J38 Cookie, J44 Moby and J47 Notch engaged in much tactile behavior very close to shore where we could see them quite beautifully underwater. They continued their engagements & rituals further up at Lime Kiln as did we. I heard above water vocals for the first time and was privileged to see "sea snakes" on a couple of occasions. The pod engaged in just about every tactile and active behavior imaginable. I feel completely blessed to have witnessed their bonds and culture in such an intimate and beautiful place. A dream encounter come true.

Boy,
J pod
is really working the west side today! Back on
Lime Kiln hydrophones
once again....Sounds like a party to me!

AMAZING DAY WITH
J-POD MOTHER, Hy'Shqa J37, AND HER BABY, J49
! At first they were all spread out; some were milling near shore and some were further offshore, traveling south in small groups. But J37 and J49 were the stars of the show, as they were really active -- splashing around and swimming in tight circles, and within a couple of minutes we saw them flip a big Salmon up in the air that they had been chasing! We also saw J2, J16, and J26, all off the west side of San Juan Island, just south of Pile Point, and even caught 2 full breaches. We had fantastic, warm weather and flat calm seas today!

Stephanie Raymond on the Victoria Clipper reported a pod of
4 - 5 Transients
, with a small calf, traveling north in
Possession Sound
this morning at

9:24 am
. They stopped and mingled around the Clinton Ferry dock, it appeared they may have made a kill there; then they continued north bound.
*

9:20 am -
Matt Malone reports
3 orcas heading north in Saratoga Passage
past the Clinton ferry dock, about 1/4 mile rom shore on the Whidbey side.
*

9:07 am -
Julie White reports
3 orcas in Totten Inlet
, near 3200 block of 90th Ave., Olympia, (2 small, one adult female) just milling, no direction given.
*
I saw what could have been the same group (at least
3 Orca
)traveling north through
Tacoma Narrows
. That was about about
2 PM
.
