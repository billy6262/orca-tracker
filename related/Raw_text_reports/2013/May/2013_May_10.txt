Orca Sightings for May 10, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'd like to report a sighting of killer whales that my family and I had this
morning
. We witnessed what seemed to be between
2 to 3 orcas off the coast of Fort Bragg, CA
. This happened
around 11AM
. We were taking a walk on the paved coastal trail in MacKerricher State park, and had a very good view over the water. We discovered what seemed to be at first, a greyish -brown big belly floating up and thought it was a grey whale. But suddenly those heads popped up, which were clearly black with the white round marking around the eye and more white marking down the side. We now believe the greyish thing, may have been seals, they were feeding on? We could see the spouts and all. At one point there seemed to be 3, but definitely 2 different heads visible. They were about half a mile north of the area where part of the beach is sectioned off due to the baby seals in the area, and about a quarter of mile away from the beach. They were swimming north. Sorry, we don't have pictures.

We received a call from Minda from the Marine Mammal Institute in
So. Beach, OR at
3:15 pm
, relaying a report from Bob Aldrich, reporting a sighting of
3 orcas
, then observing 2 orcas attacking a mom and calf Gray whale
south of Newport
, OR, where Beaver Creek meets the ocean, at Ona State Park.

Fran Matthews with Marine Discovery Tours of
Newport OR called at
10:35 am
to relay a report from a fishing vessel, 3 miles south of Newport, OR in 7 fathoms of water, of
2 orcas feeding
, one of them approached their fishing boat so they were quite excited! The whales were heading generally north.

Orca in Yaquina Bay OR
. I understand this happens from time to time, but I've never seen it until today.

I just returned from a 3 week trip. My neighbors say that
one gray has been here at Kayak Point
(in Port Susan, east of Camano Island)
every day for about two weeks
. There's one here right now,

7:30am
.

Around
8am at East Point/Fox Spit
there was
a gray
who hung around for an hour. It was rolling around on its side, moving slowly probably abut 40 yards from shore. My husband watched it from south of the point on our deck then walked down to the beach and saw watched it head north.

off Seattle tonight.

Not sure if anyone else reported this... The video (I think) speaks for itself. This seemed to be
a lone Humpback
traveling south along
the downtown Seattle waterfront
at approximately

9:30pm
. I did not see it surface again after sounding just off Pier 66. This is the first Humpback I have seen
in Elliott Bay
(assuming my ID is correct?).

About

5:30 p.m.
several of us saw a whale off
Edmonds Marina Beach
. Today when talking with a NOAA volunteer at a festival, we are thinking it was
a humpback
. This whale was black, it blew a large plume of water, and it dove down showing it's V-shaped tail.

We had a wonderful day with
a humpback whale
today off
East Point, Saturna Island
. We heard the humpback was near East Point around

12:30
and when we left the scene at about

3:15
he was still in that general area, pointing North. There was lots of surface activity including lots of pec slaps, a mini cartwheel, and even a breach! We also got some great fluke shots. I'd love to know who it was we saw out there today!
