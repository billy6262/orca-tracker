Orca Sightings for May 14, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had another incredible encounter with the
T49Bs and T65As
yesterday on the west side of
Portland Island (Southern Gulf Islands, BC)
. They were attacking a Steller Sea Lion from about

12:45 until
2:45
. The Steller ended up getting away after all that.

We reported seeing
two Transients in Sooke Harbour, BC off Vancouver Island. T-20 and T-21
have been in the area for a few days between Sooke and Victoria, but never in Sooke Harbour. This is fantastic news because in the 5 years I've lived here I have never heard of or seen any Orca activity near Sooke Harbour.

We received a message this afternoon from Jessica, reporting seeing
5 orcas at Chambers Bay (south of Tacoma), at around
10:30 or
10:45 am
this morning. There were also porpoise that seemed to be staying in one spot, close to shore. The orcas were heading south toward Steilacoom.

Scott Feist called with a sighting of
4 orcas a couple of miles off Westport WA
. He said he thought there were 3 male dorsal fins, but no photos.
