Orca Sightings for May 5, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We encountered
a small pod of orcas
traveling towards
Nanaimo between Thetis island and Valdez
.
Approx 12 orcas
we counted. We can't say for sure if they continued any further as we were heading the opposite direction. What a great experience!

4:15 -
fantastic [
gray whale
] spyhop awhile ago..all three have move west away from the
Snohomish delta to deeper water continuing towards Gedney
.

3:25 -
from
Legion Park (north Everett)
seen three whales blows so far.
Two
off the
north end of Jetty Island
sloshing :) around...so most likely feeding. Third one out from middle of Jetty Island (direction of travel unknown...distracted by many Osprey flying over our heads).

Sighting of what I think were
two greys
just southwest of Hat Island, around
0915
. The ferry slowed to keep a distance from them. Was there a baby grey? I saw one spray from a blow hole...the spine/body, then another spay from different whale next to the spine, then fluke from whale of first spray. I did not see the fluke of the second whale. So exciting and we were so close. I have been keeping an eye out all spring and this is the first time to spot a grey. They're so beautiful!

Not sure if its the same one but about
8 pm
walking down
Ruston way (Tacoma)
- most positively saw
a humpback
jump out of the water- completely out of the water- about maybe 200 yards off shore- unfortunately there was no one else around- accept a guy driving by on a motorcycle- that saw it as well and pulled in and stopped to watch- I must say- it was AWESOME-

Not sure if you got any reports but haven't seen any on your site or the West Seattle blog- yesterday we were in the car line on the Ferry dock at
3pm
, looked up and saw
a large whale (think it was a humpback
from shape, coloring and small hump) come out of the water then followed with the tail out of the water. Maybe 100' off of shore in Lincoln Park, 100' N of the dock. Just saw it 1x, then drove onto the ferry. Went up onto the deck and several people up there saw it going S on the other side of the ferry dock, again maybe 100' off of the shore (we could see the trail in the water). Disappeared from view after the point. Happened too fast for us to get a pic, but I'd be surprised if some Orca Network or WSB readers didn't have a pic or video. Truly awesome, unexpected, and amazing how close in it was.

We received a call from Sandy Charbonneau, who reported watching many
Gray whales
spouting a mile or two offshore of
Ocean Shores, WA
on Sunday and again Monday; and on Sunday while they were watching the Gray whales spouting & fluking, they also spotted
two black triangular fins that looked like orcas
- very likely some Transient orcas following the Gray whales.
