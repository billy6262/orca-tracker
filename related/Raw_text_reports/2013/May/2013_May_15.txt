Orca Sightings for May 15, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Spent much of the day on the west side of
San Juan Island
watching J pod make their way from the south end near
Salmon Bank
. They paused for a few hours milling and foraging at
Middle Bank
, then late afternoon resumed their travels northward. Nestled in a beautiful resting line approaching Land Bank they were fairly close to shore but moved off shore a distance where they remained as they continued past Lime Kiln. Last we heard they were off Henry Island still northbound in resting mode.

J pod
came in today! All appear to be there.
J8 and L87
led the pod up the west side of San Juan Island.
J2
traveled by herself offshore of the others and about midway between Group A and Group B. J28, J37 and her calf J49 are whales I was concerned about. They all look good. Lots of socializing, some apparent foraging, and many surface active behaviors. Good to have J pod back!

Today was amazing. Breaches, spyhops, cartwheels, surface and underwater vocals galore. So much play behavior.
J Pod
sure seems to be happy to be in familiar waters! I shot 877 pictures and videos.

Finally,
J Pod returned this morning
after a long absence of over 70 days, and all of them are there! First it was two transients west of Victoria, and then they turned into 7, and then...J POD!
We left them at Henry Island headed north
this evening. Joyous return! They were sure having fun!
