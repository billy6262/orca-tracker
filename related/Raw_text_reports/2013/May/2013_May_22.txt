Orca Sightings for May 22, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our new favourite
Georgia Strait humpback
was the star of the show again today. It was found just northwest of the Sandheads light station, lunge feeding, at times in only 20 feet of water! Not much fluking today, but we observed many lunges at the surface, with the whale sometimes surfacing upside down. As we departed, the Hb was headed southwest into the deeper waters of
Georgia Strait
