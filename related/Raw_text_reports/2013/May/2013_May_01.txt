We started off May with a bang! A two species day! We had
a juvenile Humpback in the Strait of Georgia
who was pretty active (see below)....lots of cartwheels. After hanging out with him/her for while we headed into
Active Pass and found the T124A's
heading south towards Prevost Island. We were excited to see a new calf with the group (T124A2's first calf so I guess that would be T124A2A....getting complicated now haha). It was a perfect way to start out May.

Great day on the water this
afternoon
! In calm seas and sunny skies we went out in search of a Minke Whale spotted at Constance Bank and ended up finding
TO65A2
just south of
Trial Island
:) We followed this lone male Transient Orca as he slowly moved Eastward leaving him a few miles south east of Oak Bay Flats!
