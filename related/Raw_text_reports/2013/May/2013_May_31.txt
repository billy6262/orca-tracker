Gang o' T's. These pics are from our encounter with
a large gang of Southbound Transients
. We first came on scene 0.5 miles off the Van Isl shoreline just south of
Campbell River
(northwest Georgia Strait). Witnessed what I thought was a seal being tossed around when we first came on scene. Some hunting behaviour occurred during our time with them, but nothing to exciting. Not like the breaches from the other day! Id's that I could get include
T018-019-019B-019C/ 023-023C-023D-023C3-023D3/ 075B-075B1-075C/ and lone female 121A
whom I am sure I have not seen very often!
