Orca Sightings for May 26, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I saw
3 orcas in Sechelt Inlet
heading towards Porpoise Bay Marina in Sechelt (about 25 miles NW of Vancouver BC). They were chasing a pod of
Pacific White Sided Dolphins
. There seemed to be one huge male orca and 2 smaller ones. It was about

10:30am
they chased them into the bay and then left and headed out of the inlet. There were lots of boats around so probably they got scared off? The dolphins hung around though in the marina probably scared of the orcas. Anyway..it was really cool because the orcas came really close to the marina and you could see them easily without binoculars even.

We encountered a breaching
Minke Whale
a few miles west of
Hein Bank
(south of San Juan island). This Minke actually breached 5 times in a row, something most of us had never seen before, it was an incredible sight:)
