Another two species day!! This year has been incredible so far with
Humpbacks hanging out in the Strait of Georgia
. The day was a bit strange though. Everyone was expecting to find J pod but, despite everyone's best efforts, they were no where to be seen. Transients, as they have all year so far, saved the day!
T63 and the T65's around East Point cruising down Boundary Pass
. It was my first time seeing T63 "Chainsaw" and his unique fin....It was awesome!. On the way home we ran into a Humpback whale lunge feeding in the Strait.

this afternoon.

It was a phenomenal day aboard the Mystic Sea today! We had
15+ Transient Orcas off of Point Lawrence heading southbound in Rosario
. They split into 3 groups and were all lunging, rolling and feeding and we even saw one do an amazing spy hop. The grand finale was when we saw a
Humpback
in the middle of the T's
just east of Thatcher Pass
! We followed the whales down to Bird Rocks before turning and heading home to Anacortes. We had fabulous warm weather and flat, glassy waters .

Dave Davenport called with a report of
a single male orca

Lopez Island

At about

3:30 pm
I saw three
adult female orca
with one juvenile about 1/2 mile west of Browns Point in outer
Commencement Bay
. They were traveling east toward the mouth of the Puyallup River. I sighted them from my sailboat while sailing. There were no other boats around at the time. My friend took pictures which I will provide after he sends them to me. I have seen Orca in nearby Dalco Passage before and reported them several years ago.
