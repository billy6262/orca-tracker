Orca Sightings for May 18, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
While moving my "new" boat from Olympia north to Bellingham, I was fortunate to see at least
3 Orca in southern Puget Sound
between Boston Harbor and Hunter's Point. That was on Saturday about
1 PM
. They were traveling North toward Hunter's Point. The only identification I can provide is that one appeared to have a larger dorsal, seemed narrow and very straight. The other two appeared to be smaller. My sightings of Orca in that area are very rare over the the last 50 years or so.

No idea what
J pod
had been up to before they made it back to the islands, but we have watched them
resting literally hours - 4 and counting
if not more...And they are doing the west side shuffle while they rest....they have not been out of sight since early this afternoon. Super tight group or two, up down, up down. Some of these fisherman out here have had the experience of a lifetime. Sigh.

Today the Mystic Sea did a complete circumnavigation of the San Juan Islands, covering about 100 miles! We finally found the whales at
Hannah Heights
, heading north very slowly. It was a great show with
20+ Orcas from J pod
- we saw several fluke shots and tail slaps and even a couple breaches! We also saw several Bald Eagles, some Harbor Seals, lots of Harbor Porpoise, and even had a quick visit with a California Sea Lion.

We are on the Queen of Cumberland pulling into
Otter Bay (North Pender Island)
and passed some
killer whales
heading the other way (
going south
). There was a large male and at least 2 smaller fins, though we didn't have much time. If you know who they are, I would be interested.

We noticed
three orcas at
5:00 p.m.
heading north out of
Eld Inlet
. Then they dove. When they surfaced again, they had turned around under water and headed back south into Eld for 30-40 minutes. Then they came out again. They did that same routine (at least 4 times) until

8:30
- when they headed the furthest north since
5:00. Last sighting was as they were heading north toward Squaxin Island and then hung a "west" and headed toward Hope Island.

3:10 - the humpback
is reported near the
Hood Canal bridge
heading toward Pt Gamble.
*

2:45 - Humpback whale. Salsbury park
. - north of
Hood canal bridge
. Saw it three times, then it fluked in what appeared to be a deep dive. Last seen headed towards Port Gamble. The whale was heading north out of Hood Canal and surfaced maybe 30 feet off shore. I of course was looking at my phone. I heard it, and the kid yelling so grabbed my camera and headed around the point. The whale continued around the point still 30-40 ft off the shore, past the dock and the three boat launches. The boat launches were stacked up with shrimpers waiting to pull their boats in. The whale surfaced again, 10 ft off one of the waiting boats. It surfaced one last time, and this time did a deep dive, and by the time I got my camera organized, I barely captured it's flukes disappearing. I saw it surface two more times as it headed out of the bay, and then three times from Point No Point before it disappeared headed north.

I saw
one whale
today at

2:18pm
as I headed west on the
Hood Canal Bridge
! I was approximately 1/4th the way across the bridge heading west & I saw the whale to my right, on the north side of the bridge, heading south, on its way under the bridge. It's huge body rolled & then its huge tail fluke came out of the water. The bridge obstructed any view of head. I'm not familiar enough with types of whales to determine what type of whale this was, but the tail was a grey color & classic shape.
Humpback
? Unfortunately, I was unable to pull my car to the side of the rode to continue to watch him to see if there were any markings, what he was doing, get photos, etc. I have lived in Port Ludlow for 15 years & cross the bridge on practically a daily basis & have never seen whales there before (at the Hood Canal Bridge), so I thought this might be of interest to you. Also, I am concerned that he was going in the wrong direction & may be lost?
