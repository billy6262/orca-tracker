Orca Sightings for May 7, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We have had some very interesting whale sightings around
East Point, Saturna Island
this past week. There have been
2 separate confirmed sightings of pilot whales
. Those of us that live out this way have never seen them here before, at least in the past 5 years (I don't know of the years before that). The first sighting was two or three - the report was made by John Gahn on your site (I asked him to post with you). John is formerly from Oregon and is familiar with pilot whales in those waters and has spent a lot of time on the water. He was in a kayak and couldn't get an overview. The second report was my neighbours', Rick Graham and Kevin Leslie, who saw 2 very close to our shoreline close to East Point Park. Rick used to work at the Vancouver Aquarium. It was rather funny because the day before I told them about the pilot whale sighting and they didn't believe me :) The next day they saw them and confirmed that they truly are pilot whales. Then a rare occurrence of
a humpback whale in Boundary Pass on Friday,
