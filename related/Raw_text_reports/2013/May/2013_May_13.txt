Orca Sightings for May 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
I had a very interesting encounter with the
T49Bs and T65As
in the morning. Pelagic from Deer Harbor Charters found the whales near
Crane Island
at about

8:30 AM
. I headed out on the Western Explorer to see them in San Juan Channel, near Yellow Island, then Pelagic left. At one point, as the whales went down for a long dive (about 5 minutes), a 45'-50' power boat came up the channel at speed. The boat passed me at about 100 yards to my offshore side, throwing about a 3' wake. As the boat continued on its way the whales suddenly surfaced in the boat's wake and began surfing it. This continued for about 2-3 minutes until the boat's captain finally seemed to notice and stopped the boat, at which point the whales went back to traveling up the channel. Later that morning, near Speiden Island they attacked a Steller Sea Lion, which managed to make it safely to shore.
