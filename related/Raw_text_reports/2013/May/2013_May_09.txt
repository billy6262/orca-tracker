Five Star Whale Watching's album:
Gray Whale near Becher Bay!
Patch, beloved gray whale #49,
appears to be headed back out to the big beautiful Pacific ocean after spending a couple of months foraging in the inland waters of Salish sea. Safe and happy voyages to you big guy, was nice spending springtime in your presence, see you next year!

From
Bainbridge Island, approx 6pm, about 2 miles south of Agate Pass
, I was kayaking with a friend in completely quiet and still water and we heard a big SPLASH... Looked over and there was the top of a whale, about 30 feet long & approx 500 feet away. Didn't get a good look as the sun was setting behind it, but thinking it to be
the lone humpback
that has been sighted in the area??? Watched for a few minutes but didn't see it surface again. What a privilege.

A gray whale
was just off shore at
Harrington Lagoon today @ 1
. It was an amazing sight to see its fluke as it dove down! It was headed toward Penn Cove.
