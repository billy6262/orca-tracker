Orca Sightings for August 30, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sitting on deck tonight (
West Side Haro Strait) around
11:00 p.m
. Hearing
blows every 5 seconds
or so. Too dark to see whales, no moon. Sounds like 3-4 (maybe Transients)? Long time no hear, no see. - Deb

The
T036's, T099's, and T030's
showed up late evening
south of Victoria
heading east. Earlier in the day we had the
T185's and the T137's
at the Romeo buoy heading north. They were first reported in the morning seen by a tug boat captain near Dungeness Spit. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

We had
20 Transient Orcas just East of Trial Island
yesterday evening including the
TO30's
:) - Andrew Lees, Marine Naturalist, Five Star Whale Watching

We spent the day with
transient orcas and humpback whales
! The
orcas were found near Dungeness Spit
in the morning while the
humpbacks were west of Victoria near Race Rocks
. We were able to identify a large male in the group as
T137
, who was seen with another male and female alongside him. Skipper Geoffrey noted that there were
two separate humpback whales
seen throughout the day; the first was seen south of Race Rocks while the other was south of Victoria in the Juan de Fuca Strait. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whale Whale Watch

Don Taylor reported seeing
two orcas
from his fishing boat
16 miles off the coast of Oregon
just north of the California border, at 42.30 x 124.47.
