Orca Sightings for August 26, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Wanted to report
a killer whale sighting off the Washington coast
. I was out on a charter boat, unfortunately without my camera but we encountered
about 30-40 killer whales
in the vicinity of 48 13 N and 124 53 W in about 400 foot of water. This area is about
15 miles to the NW of Cape Alava
. I think they were residents as the area they were working was chock full of salmon. - Pat Gearin via Brad Hanson

Sweet ride along on the Odyssey... Hopeful morning having listened to the residents on the hydrophones but
all orca pods seen early in the morning around San Juan Island
,
Resident and Transient, powered their way north into Canada
. Residents in Active Pass were too far for this beautiful old boat but Capt. Pete took us to Swanson Channel to meet up with these Transient (mammal eating) orca. We had just ten minutes to marvel at the beauty of these families tightly grouped in total resting mode...I'd never seen such peaceful and extreme logging, these whales were asleep. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

Our

12:15
traveled out west in search of the
large group of residents off Sooke
. Out of nowhere, our crew spotted
T20 and T21 off East Sooke Park
-both familiar fins to us! Later in the day Skipper Mallard also found
a lone humpback whale
milling about off Gordon's beach. Meanwhile, our other afternoon tours were on scene with
another humpback southeast of Race Rocks

I watched
K16
chase down and play with a neonate harbor porpoise on the morning of

Entry 2:
s.w. of Race Rocks
. She left it for several minutes while it swam away and then tracked it down and continued playing with it until releasing it a second time. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales

This morning we caught up with a large group of whales just
south of Race Rocks
including
all of J and K pod and members of L pod
too! Naturalist Wilma reported that her 1st Mate Anthony identified some of the whales as
K26, J26, J44, J24 and J28
, and all the whales were active and putting on quite the show. Skipper Mallard was also out in the action with the passengers on his zodiac, and he saw a young harbour porpoise being dragged and knocked around by K-16, a resident, not a transient killer whale! Skipper mallard said he had never seen such behaviour before, as residents are only salmon eating mammals, unlike transient orcas which prey on other marine mammals. - Naturalist Leah Kuzmuk, Prince of Whale Whale Watch
