Orca Sightings for August 18, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
5:23pm - Southern Resident Orca calls on Lime Kiln
. CWR posted hearing them at
5:00 but was just now. I heard vocals. Sounds like they are still off in the distance. - Alisa Lemire Brooks

1:41 - Orcas at False Bay
. - Erwin Vermeulen

A few of us were lucky enough to see
lots of orcas in Haro Strait
on Sunday mid-day, between False Bay and Eagle Cove. There were probably at least 20 out, several hundred yards offshore, very active at the surface, with lots of breaching, tail flapping and spy-hopping. There were many males and females present. It was hard to tell what direction they were headed, because they were swimming around in all directions for a while, but I think ultimately they were headed south. - Norah, Jodie, Andrea, and Liz

To our delight, we sighted
resident orcas, transient orcas, and humpbacks
today. Captain Gavin drove south to San Juan Island, where they came across a group of
6 orcas near False Bay
. Naturalist Wilma identified the group as part of
J pod
, one of the resident killer whale pods that frequent this area in the summer months. One male in particular,
J27 "Blackberry"
gave guests an excellent showing of his large dorsal fin as he frequently surfaced and tail slapped around the boat. In the afternoon,
west of Victoria Harbour towards Race Rocks they spotted 11 transient orcas
swimming in Juan de Fuca Strait! Two of the transients were also seen yesterday, who were identified as
T20 and T21
. Naturalist Jen said that the whales were vocalizing to each other and actively surfacing, even some spy hops and a breach! Our trips also enjoyed seeing two humpback whales, who were travelling just 5 miles west of where the transients were. It was also the same mother and calf we saw yesterday off Discovery Island. Skipper Marek also spotted a
Minke whale at Salmon Bank
. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watching

9:34 - Lots of orcas off False Bay
right now!! More than just the L54's!!!

11:12 - Lots of orcas from K and L pod
spread all over the place. All South of Pile Point now heading down island. - Melisa Pinnow

Report of
a lone orca in Stanley park
600 ft from the third beach. Received this report earlier today from Marnie Bolam. Most likely a transient. - Josh McInnes

T18 or T19 ....Sheep Island

T18's hunting seals at Darcy Island
(yes, that's a seal flying over the whale). - Mark Malleson
*
T37's at Coyote Bank
. - Mark Malleson
*
The
T030's, T036A's and T037's were first spotted off of Bechey Head at 0830
heading east. They turned back west at Coyote Bank late afternoon and were last seen heading west near Race Rocks. - Mark Malleson, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

"We saw
two Minke Whales today as we boated South to Seattle from the San Juans
. We didn't take photos. The whales were heading north on the East side of Whidbey island in the strait of Juan de Fuca. We were
south of Deception pass and north of Smith Island
.....between Smith Island and Whidbey Island. At first we thought we were seeing porpoise and then it became clear quickly that these were whales. Sorry, No photos and I can't tell you how long they were either. We saw them between 12 - 1 pm." - Kari Wright (relayed by Frances Robertson)

We spotted
a minke whale just outside of Thatcher Pass
who looked like he started the morning with a little too much coffee! He breached for us at least 5 times and was traveling and porpoising at a 12 knot pace and passed a ferry boat along the way. It was a very exciting morning! - Bart Rulon, Island Adventures Whale Watching
