Orca Sightings for August 16, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Jordan Cooke called with a report from the
Gwaii Haanas National Park
, off the
SW shore of Haida Gwaii Island
(north of Vancouver Island). He and a friend were kayaking miles from shore when they saw about
15 orcas
about a kilometer away. The orcas were very active, zig-zagging over the same spot while he and his friend paddled to within about a half kilometer of them. Suddenly the orcas disappeared. A few minutes later they heard loud clicks and buzzes coming through the hulls of their kayaks, and moments later the orcas came up all around them, some within ten feet of their kayaks. After about 60-90 seconds of what felt like intense scrutiny by the whales, they disappeared and were never seen again although visibility was good for miles around.

mid-August
George Jarvis was tuna fishing
140-180 miles offshore
, out from roughly
between Newport and Coos Bay
, about six weeks ago. He was recalling from memory after seeing a poster, so the date and location are not specific. He said there were
at least a dozen orcas
. He said he thought they looked small, and the water was warmer than usual.
Note: he may have seen offshores.
