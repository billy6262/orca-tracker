Saturday morn roughly

6:00 am
. We were heading out to
Swiftsure Bank
for some salmon fishing. it was very foggy and we ran into
a group of killer whales
. About
5 to 6 miles off Tatoosh Island
, maybe half way to Swiftsure. They ended up on both sides of boat for a short distance before we lost them in fog & rough water. Not sure how to identify them but one seemed to have much larger dorsal fin then others. I believe there was a possible young one in group also. - Greg Story

Today we saw
both resident and transient orcas
, as well as
a humpback
. Passengers stopped at
Eagle Point on San Juan Island
to check out some six resident orcas including
L54 and her three calves as well as L88 and L84
! Meanwhile over here in Victoria, passengers caught up with
T20 and T21 just off Clover Point
! These two orcas are definitely familiar fins to us as we have seen this duo numerous times already this summer. In the late afternoon passengers were able to see the two transients hunting and eating a harbour seal, which is a pretty crazy scene to watch! Passengers were caught by surprise by the sight of
a lone humpback in the Georgia Strait
off Galiano Island! - Naturalist Leah Kuzmuk, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

I finally got to get up to see "Windy" the
humpback in the Strait of Georgia
. - Ivan Reiff

1:52 pm -
We just heard and saw
a huge whale go through Colvos Passage
! My husband and daughter went running down the beach with the camera to see if they could get pictures! My daughter saw it breach out of the water and then by the time they caught up to it...it never came back up! We got some pictures from far away but they are pretty fuzzy and hard to tell what it was. Whatever it was it was moving slow and breathing big! - Noelle Summit
From photos provided this is identified as a humpback
.
