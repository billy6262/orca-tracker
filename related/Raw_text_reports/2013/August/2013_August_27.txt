Orca Sightings for August 27, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
So, I am still amazed. Needed to tell someone. Hope this could be helpful not only to whom it may concern but also for the orca that I believe may be in some trouble. Here's why. I was fishing on
the duwamish river
. I saw
an orca
, not an adult. Looked on the smaller side. The guy fishing next to me also saw the whale. We were shocked. It was great to see, although that turned to concern (obviously an orca should not be heading up a river).
Only saw one
. Perhaps lost? With that, obviously neither of us are any type of expert. As far as its location. It would be about
a mile up river from the 1st ave bridge in south seattle
. If u were to drive to the exact spot it is in the Georgetown area of seattle. It's at the
very south end of Carleton st
. And east marginal way. Essentially between the bridge and southpark neighborhood on the river. I never did see another one. Just this particular one. He surfaced twice. And in the same manner both times. I hope I did indeed see what I thought I saw. I looked at pics of risso dolphins. I'm fairly confident that is not what I saw. From my perspective I would say the orca if indeed that's what it was was about 10 ft. Quite a large dorsal fin. He surfaced on his side. I saw a large dorsal slightly then saw the side dorsal come all the way out of the water. Almost like a corkscrew surfacing. As a side note. The fisherman next to me saw him at the same time. First thing out of his mouth was "that was a killer whale, wow". I did not get any photos. Just wanted to inform someone. Found you thru a google search. - Jonathan

One of the best trips I've had in a long time! Where to begin.......We picked them up in
Porlier Pass heading into Trincomali channel
. They just hung out picking off seals and interacting like crazy! Spyhops, breaches, tail slaps....you name it, we saw it! We were able to ID the
T30s, T34s, T36s, T37s, T100s and the T101s
