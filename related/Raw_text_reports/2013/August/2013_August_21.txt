Orca Sightings for August 21, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
4:02 -
now it appears they are heading more east, toward the south tip of Whidbey. One adult male, plus about 4 others, likely Transients.
Saw them, headed toward Point no point, near the green buoy, at about

3:55 pm
.
Karen Anderson called at
3:30 pm to report orcas heading south in Mutiny Bay, South of Bush point, Whidbey Island. - Susan Berta

There were
two groups of transients orcas this morning
, one heading
west past Race Rocks
, and the other coming
inbound by Sooke
. The whales then met,
joining into one large group
and continued swimming east. Since transients rarely travel in this kind of large group, naturalist Jen on the Ocean Magic compared it to a "super-pod" of transients, in that they displayed the active and playful behaviour similar to what we see when resident convene in a super-pod. Our 9am Vancouver departure cruised past the Victoria waterfront towards Race Rocks, where they joined the group of approximately
26 transient orcas
. In the afternoon the large group of whales went east through the Juan de Fuca Strait, eventually ending the day south of Hein Bank. The whales had split into two groups once more, with one group leading and swimming towards Puget Sound; the other travelled slowly behind. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray, Prince of Whales Whale Watch
