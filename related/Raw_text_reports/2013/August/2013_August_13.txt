Orca Sightings for August 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
We just saw what appeared to be
two humpback whales
. We live near Dutchers Cove, about 2 miles south of Vaughn bay on
Case inlet
. They were about 2 to 400 yards off shore at about

8:10 to
8:20 p.m
. they were far enough off shore in the twilight to get any photos. Both whales had the distinctive Humpback fin. They were headed north at last sighting. - Jeff Kimball

Thayer Hillis called with an orca report from Aug. 13 at
4 pm off the coast of Oregon
, at 43 14.5 x 126 35.6. He reports
9 orcas
total, including 4 adult males, in three small groups about 1000' apart, apparently foraging. One was upside down doing inverted tail lobs. He says they were in water over a mile deep, and there were no salmon around, but there were lots of albacore tuna, which is what he was fishing for. We talked about the method for netting fecal material and scales to determine prey, and it sounds like he might be interested in gathering samples if possible.
