Orca Sightings for August 2, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Our Victoria boats headed out west this morning and caught up with a well-known
humpback, known as "Big Mamma"
. She has reportedly given birth to three calves in the past six years; we identify her by the distinct pattern on the underside of her fluke, and as her name implies, she is a very "big" female! Later we joined three more humpbacks at
