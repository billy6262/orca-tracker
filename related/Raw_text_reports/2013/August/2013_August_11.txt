Orca Sightings for August 11, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Made a very last minute (good) decision this morning and was out the door within 15 minutes, after hearing that "whales are everywhere". We headed north aboard Mystic Sea and found the
L12s and L22s north east of Patos Island
.....
L89 and mom L22
made a very close pass by the boat - squeals of fright and delight from the passengers. - Jill Hein

Oh how I needed today!!! Woke up to rain, and my first thought was "oh great, I'm on the open boat..." Followed by, "what, rain? Wait! That means whales might be coming in!!!" And come in they did! First trip, just as we left the skies cleared and the sun came out AND we had a
super pod of Southern Residents
--been more than 6 weeks since I've seen J Pod! On the way home we had another awesome encounter--
a mother/calf pair of humpbacks in Speiden Channel
! First time I've seen a mother/calf pair this year, and definitely first time in Speiden Channel. Second trip we had the same pair of humpbacks, but this time they were in Presidents Channel headed East, while some of
L Pod was in the same channel heading West!!!
So awesome to see so many whales. - John Boyd

Spent sunset with the
L12's and L22's

Friday Harbor.
By now they are probably past Pear Point. - Melisa Pinnow

we saw quite a few whales, approximately

A curious
humpback in the Strait of Georgia
. We've had several encounters with this curious humpback whale this week! There have been more humpbacks visiting the Gulf of Georgia this year than any other year since we've been operating, so it's such a treat to get to spend time with one! And SO surreal when they seem to be curious about us too! - Photo by Steveston Seabreeze Adventures whale watch

gray whales
just past the kelp line 100 yds off of
Shipwreck Point

415PM
