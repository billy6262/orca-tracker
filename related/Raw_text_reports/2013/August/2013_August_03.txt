Orca Sightings for August 3, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
My volunteers at the
Cape Meares Lighthouse in Oregon
were watching from the lighthouse and said they were
2 to 4 miles out, at least 10 possibly more
, but too far out to get a firm count, and unless a visitor had a good camera and got some pics the host did not get any. The orcas are a sight we don't get too often down here and normally not a large group of them. - Travis Korbe

By midday we received reports of
a humpback past west of Sooke off Otter Point
. We spotted the humpback initially off Otter Point and continued following the animal all afternoon towards Beachy Head. The humpback was seen tail slapping lots and fortunately for us was not taking long deep dives but rather was spotted "logging" or hanging at the surface with just an exposed dorsal hump for long periods of time. - Naturalist Leah Kuzmuk, Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Skipper Marek and his passengers aboard the Queen of Hearts travelled southeast to
Hein Bank
where they picked up a lone
minke
whale milling about. Another highlight for Skipper Marek and his passengers is when four harbour porpoise popped up right off the bow of the zodiac and everyone was able to get a great glimpse of their small shiny grey dorsal fins! - Naturalist Leah Kuzmuk

We here at
Chito Beach Resort
have been seeing
3 gray whales
off and on for about a week. Looks like 2 full grown and one smaller. This morning they came east from Shipwreck Point right in front of the Resort. One of the adults and the smaller one continued east towards Sekiu. The other adult came back west and around Shipwreck Point. Some feeding going on but the two headed east were really moving. - Amy Cramer
