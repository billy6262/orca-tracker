Entry 1:
Here is the
Humpback Whale Calf

Amazing night out on the water with son Kalen. Watching
Transient Orcas in Cowichan Bay
in the moonlight with fireworks in the background from Butchart Gardens. Pure magic and so happy to have been able to share it with my son, a night I will never forget. Then to top it off
T102
who was 250 meters off our beam turned 90Â° and headed straight for diving under the boat vocalizing for about 30 seconds. I then looked over the sided of the boat and had the surprise of my life. There is T102 sitting a foot under the water on his side looking at me vocalizing. He then surfaces swims the length of Taku and swims off into the dark. WOW. New favourite whale... - Simon Pidcock

We were at
Ruckle Provincial Park on Salt Spring Island yesterday evening about
7:00 pm - 8 orca went past
fairly close to shore. It appeared to be 2 large males, and 3 moms each with babies. They proceeded toward Victoria, stopping to play east of pierce island. There were about 5 whale watching boats on them. One of these boats appeared to be acting in a rather aggressive way but I could not see a name on it. Sorry no photos as I was too excited to leave shore to get my camera!! - Jana Johnson
