Orca Sightings for October 26, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Constance Bank (Strait of Juan de Fuca). The
T46Bs and T46Cs
had been milling around
Constance Bank
since around

10:30AM
, and when we got there in the afternoon, they were still prowling around, not really traveling definitively in any direction (possible interesting side note:
members of J, K, and L pods were at one point about 8NM to the west
of where the Biggs/transients were, possibly preventing the Ts from making a comitment to go west ... not to mention in the mix with the ressies were multiple humpback whales! wow!). Nevertheless, these expert hunters picked off one harbour seal while we were with them, possibly two. We left them milling and trending NW toward William Head. - Tasli Shaw

(
Includes transients, residents, and humpbacks
)
Mark set out with reports of eight transient
killer whales at 11am
, but there was much more in store. Captain Jeff on Ocean Magic followed at

12:15pm
and picked up the same
group of transients
. It was then that we heard our two favourite words in the English language over the radio: "
Residents inbound
"
All three pods of resident whales zigged and zagged around as they came in with the tide.
There was resting, foraging, and socializing, all in the same group! But the
humpbacks
were not to be out-done. Throughout the day at least
7 or 8 individuals
were spotted, including
Split-Fin and Heather
. They are offspring of some of the original humpbacks to return to these waters after they were hunted out. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

So we had to go to Victoria, Canada to do it, but on my last day of being on the boat a couple of us Friday Harbor people saw
Orcas
today! I'm so happy I got to see them.
T46b and c group
. There were also about 20 humpbacks out there AND Residents about 20 miles west of where we were milling off of Vancouver. Super great day, I knew it would be - Heather MacIntyre
