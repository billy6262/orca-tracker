Orca Sightings for October 12, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
My husband and I were at
Titlow Beach Park (west Tacoma) for sunset last night, and saw a gray whale
(I think) swimming around about 300-400 ft off shore. - Jamie Sproul

BCFerry trip headed to Victoria on Saturday, just
past 4pm
announced
whales headed north offshore of North Pender
. The crew initially said
humpbacks
, but corrected it to Fin whales?? I observed 3 blows from each of the pair and then there was a back arch and fluke lift from each and they were gone. The flukes were narrow, pointed and distinctly white. They didnt look like the typical humpback fluke however. Possibly minke? Yet they dont often lift flukes on a dive ... - Paul C

While out for a kayak trip with some friends on Saturday we spotted
two orca way inside Pedder Bay near Weir Point
. The one in the photo was by far the largest while the other one had a dorsal fin about half the size. I'm not sure if you might be able to tell the identification of this whale but the locals said that he has been around before. - Mark Byrne

An amazing encounter with Mark Malleson (

15:14
) aboard 'The Empress',
5 miles south of Otter Point (Sooke)
with a
pprox.7 'exotic, unknown' transients
. (Later ID'd as CA166s). They were busy beating up a stellar sealion when we arrived on scene. Our encounter lasted 45 minutes. We left once all animals had gone down ... for dinner at last. An incredible encounter with the top apex predator in the ocean. I have more videos on my facebook for anyone interested. I will make them public. Thanks to Mark and Prince of Whales for this amazing opportunity. - Claire Mosley, Marine Biologist, Jamie's Whaling Station
