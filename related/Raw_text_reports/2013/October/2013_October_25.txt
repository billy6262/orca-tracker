Orca Sightings for October 25, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Mark Malleson broke his personal humpback record. A radio transmission came through at

11:45am
, less than an hour into Mark's trip. He was blown away by the incredible visibility, thrilled about the conditions, saying everything was "gorgeous!" In three hours on the water Mark saw
no fewer than 17 individual humpback whales!
This was truly a once in a lifetime trip. A peak whale day, during peak humpback season, during an exceptional humpback year. Naturalist Rhonda noted that there was even
a humpback inside Race Rocks Ecological Reserve
; most likely rolling through the kelp and feeding on invertebrates. There is evidence humpback feeding habits could more be diverse than originally thought, and this observation certainly supports that. - Prince of Whales Whale Watch

Saw what I thought
might be a Gray Whale (possibly a humpback)
around

12:30pmoff of Pt. Wilson
. Slowly rolling/moving through the water, saw it spouting(?), no dorsal fin, heading in to Puget Sound. The one day I didn't have my spotting scope and I see something!!! - Doug Bullis
