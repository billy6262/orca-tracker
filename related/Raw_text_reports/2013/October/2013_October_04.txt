Orca Sightings for October 4, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Left our dock at Snug Harbor Resort and Marina at
12:30 today. In ten minutes we were attacked by 20 or so Dall's Porpoise. All hands on the bow as the Dall's ran in front of the Peregrine. As I looked off towards Kelp Reef,
a humpback fluke sounded
. The Dall's followed us almost to the humpie. After a half hour with the big humpback, we went to see
3 Transient Orcas just south of Victoria
. Another ok afternoon... - James Mead Maya
