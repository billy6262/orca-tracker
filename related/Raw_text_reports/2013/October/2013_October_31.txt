Orca Sightings for October 31, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Today
J Pod off SJI Land Bank West Side Preserve
heading north very slowly in amazing groups at about noon, heading south,
J16's and J17's
just off the rocks at

12:30 pm
. Many very close in at
Hannah Heights at 1pm
. At
4pm offshore of Pile Point
about a mile. My pics showed that K's were with the J's off San Juan Island. The K13's were very tight to shore off Hannah Heights. - Sharon Grace

I walked inside the house and had an email waiting for me. Whales headed toward the island! Called the friends, they came running and soon we were with
J and K Pod off of Pile Pt.
They were foraging. We watched for a while as they started to
head west at
4:30
. On the way home, 20 or so Dall's followed us for a while. Great impromptu-ish day! - Capt. Jim Maya

What a way to wrap up the season. We found local
humpback whale BCY0409 in the Gulf Islands (Swanson Channel)
, making big circles and 5 minute dives. We continued south to the
bottom of San Juan Island
where
J and K pod
were after exiting Puget Sound two days previous. They did not spend very much time off the island before heading west again, so we were so so lucky to see them forage, breach, and socialize in groups of 3 and more.
But the real treat was the
large group of Pacific White-sided dolphins
that were
just outside of Active Pass in the Gulf of Georgia
. There were hundreds of them, at least 200. If you've ever seen these acrobatic ocean goers, you know how energetic they are! It was such a privilege to watch that many of them porpoising and lunging themselves out of the water at high speed. Just the sound they made just with their splashing was impressive! Its hard to explain what seeing that many dolphins is like, so here are a few photos that might help illustrate. - Tasli Shaw, Steveson Seabreeze Adventures
