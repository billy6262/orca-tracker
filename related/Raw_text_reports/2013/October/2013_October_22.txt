============================================================

Entry 1:
About

5:40 pm

2-3 dorsals heading north, closer to Edmonds side
. - Christy Oliphant

2:05 pm -
Jeff Hogan relayed a report from Whitney Neuberger of Whale Scout about
orcas seen off Edmonds
, heading south, close to shore in thick fog.
*
10 am -
I just got back a walk at
Point No Point.
Two roofers working on the crews duplex told me that about
4 Orcas passed by there headed south
around 10 this morning. Those south of here might want to keep a look out for them. He knew the difference between the Orca and the Dall's porpoise. Said one had a sail as tall as he was. - Judy Anderson Roupe
*
9 am -
Justine Buckmaster, naturalist on the Victoria Clipper, called to report
a pod of orcas off Double Bluff, Whidbey Island
, heading south. The only photo that came out decent from this morning's encounter with the Southern Residents shows these are the
K20s
(Spock and her offspring) with another female in the background. You can see from the photo just how foggy it was out there! We were lucky to have stumbled upon them.
