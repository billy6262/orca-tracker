Orca Sightings for October 18, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
In his first whale report, Coho Hogan, age 7, notified his dad Jeff of Killer Whale Tales that he saw
three orca dorsal fins and saddle patches from Lincoln Park in West Seattle
on Friday about

11:30
. Jeff and others scanned the waters between W. Seattle and Vashon Island searching for them but the sea surface was foggy and visibility poor.
