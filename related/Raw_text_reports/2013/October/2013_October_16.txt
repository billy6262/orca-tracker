Orca Sightings for October 16, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
So. Resident orcas off Vargas Island, west Vancouver Island. K pod!
20 open saddles off Vargas I. (west coast of Vancouver Island) at
15:00
heading down the coast. - Rod Palm, Strawberry Isle Research
(Open saddles indicates either Northern or Southern Resident orcas)

At about

5:30 pm
today the
bulk of J pod
was in a semi tight group about a mile or two
offshore of False Bay
heading south. One large male foraged inshore of this group just south of Pile Point, while another large male, likely L87, foraged about a mile off Pile Point. Another female, likely J2, foraged farther offshore of Pile Point. Where will they end up tomorrow?? Jeanne Hyde and I also enjoyed watching
a large humpback circle
in the bay off the
Hannah Heights community beach
for quite a while, before we both left at about
5:30pm with the humpback still circling close inshore. - Sharon Grace

The resident
J-Pod killer whales
were found about
20 minutes outside of Victoria
. With glassy calm waters, the sun beaming overhead, and the killer whales all surfacing together, skipper Rush affirmed that it was truly "a beautiful sight to see." The
humpbacks were back i
n full force today as well. Approximately
5 or 6 of them
were spotted around the
Race Rocks
area. - Prince of Whales Whale Watching

J pod
is reported by Ken Balcomb to be heading east or northeast past
Discovery Island
.
