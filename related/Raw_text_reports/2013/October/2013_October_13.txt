Orca Sightings for October 13, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
*
Keller Dalvin of Olympia called at
3 pm to report a Gray whale off Capitol Beach
, Steamboat Island, swimming north close to shore. Cascadia Research has looked at photos of this whale and it doesn't look thin, so hopefully it is a healthy one and it will find it's way out of Puget Sound - maybe it will come up to N. Puget Sound and snack on some ghost shrimp before heading out again!
*
I just saw,
(
2:30PM) a grey whale
, traveling north
in Budd inlet N. of Olympia
. It passed within 100ft-200? of my house on Capital Beach, on Steamboat Isl. I could see it clearly, it was spouting, I could hear it breathing, spectacular!
*
We spotted
a (gray) whale last night at Port Plaza Park in Olympia
. The whale is to the left of the tug boat. - Joe Penrod

Tony just called to report a group of
~100 White-sided dolphins in Malaspina Strait, BC, at 3 pm
- at first they were headed NW, then as he was talking to me they stopped and were milling and feeding.
