Orca Sightings for October 5, 2013
============================================================

Entry 1:
Transient orca off the Eel River CA. Here be pix posted by a tuna sports fisher on the Humboldt Tuna Club website on Sunday, 5 Oct - he'd commented that a highlight of their day was trolling alongside
a big kw
, I asked for pix, he replied... and I'll post results, try to get more of a discussion going, again. They were near the
Eel River buoy
, which is at 40°43'25" N 124°34'41" W. - Jeff Jacobsen

Finally found this humpback in the Clayoquot Sound ID guide. This is CS280.

A pair of humpback whales were in Haro Strait
. - Monika Wieland
*
Nearing
Victoria, two magnificent humpback whales
cruised along side-by-side, the sound of their blows resonating across the glassy sea surface as they dived and surfaced in harmony. We saw the undersides of both tail flukes as the whales prepared to take a deeper dive - a fitting farewell as we turned for home. - Sandra Pollard, SSAMN, Freeland, Whidbey Island

Humpbacks everywhere
lately!! We our "log lover" mystery humpback rolling and rubbing on a log and today with had
BCY0409 "Yogi"
playing with some kelp! - Gary Sutton
*
West of Victoria, past Race Rocks, towards Sooke we came across a group of 40+ orcas
scattered along the shoreline and offshore near Beechy Head,
members of both J and K pod, and they believed L pod
was also in the area. Our
12:15 Ocean Magic also saw
a humpback whale just outside of Victoria Harbour
. - Naturalist Elspeth McGillivray , Prince of Whales Whale Watch
*
It was nature in the raw as we watched
a pod of 6 to 8 transient orca off Eagle Point, San Juan Island, make a kill
. Well that explains what the poor little harbor seal was hiding from. Afterwards passengers on 'Mystic Sea' reported seeing an orca swimming backwards! The whales eventually headed north in a tight formation - a truly memorable last day for us. - Richard Snowberger, Crew/Naturalist on Mystic Sea
*
Orca Whales from the south end of SJ island
. A great start to any day. On the way out in the afternoon we stopped at Whale Rocks to view about 50 roaring Steller Sea Lions. What a sight! Then on up to the
T36As and T124s
. Soon another boat came on the radio to let us know about
2 Humpback Whales and 2 more Transient Orcas
they found to the north. So we circumnavigated San Juan Island with lots of playful Dall's Porpoises,
T20 and T21, and 2 Humpbacks (BCY0324 "Big Mama" and CS280)
on the way home. - Ivan Reiff, Western Prince Whale Watching & Wildlife Tours
*
Photos and memories of days like today are what will get me through the winter. Amazing afternoon on the water with James Mead Maya: we saw
six transients and three humpback whales
. - Monika Wieland
*
Pretty sublime ...
T124E, T124D, T36A, and T36A1 off Henry Island
. - Tasli Shaw
*
Phenomenal day out there! Glassy waters and all the wildlife we could possibly fit in to an afternoon. Seals, two kinds of sea lions, two kinds of porpoises, a bald eagle,
two groups of transient orcas, and humpback whales
