Orca Sightings for May 11, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
I was completely delighted by 2 Gray whales immediately outside of the Doghouse on Saturday - they were there feeding and rolling, etc., for over an hour and a half... Approx.
3:00pm to
4:20 or so. It was absolutely stunning, and the tips even improve when we see whales! They love the naturalist/waitress/bartender idea! They immediately started to head South after a boat approached, and got much too close. Also, two Dall's porpoise around
4:50 heading North up Saratoga Passage (from the Doghouse view).

Hi Susan and Howie,
I wanted to report my first sighting ever of a lone gray whale. My husband and I was at the Edmonds beach where the waterpark is on Saturday
May 11. I was eating lunch enjoying the peaceful view of the mountains droppng down into the water when my husband came up to the car and said he saw a whale. I watched to see what he thought was a whale and sure enough the creature resurfaced with a great blow and covered in barnicles. I only wondered at that moment if there were any divers around the park and sure enough I saw two surface and start kicking inland as fast as they possibly could. Now, I'm not sure if they actually saw the gray but only know that that would be my reaction as close as they seemed to be. Feeling so fortunate to have witnessed such a beautiful sight on such a beautiful day.....
