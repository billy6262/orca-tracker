Orca Sightings for May 19, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan: We've been seeing lots of feeding pits here at East Point (Saratoga Passage) every morning at low tide. Last night (Sunday) at midnight we actually heard and faintly saw what I took to be one gray whale feeding. It was there for about an hour.

Sunday at
9:30 am, Paul Evans reported J pod at Burrow's Island Lighthouse, heading toward Deception Pass, then turning & heading toward the south end of Lopez Island. Shane was with them from
12:30 at Salmon Bank until around
2:30 just past Pile Pt. He also reported 1 minke off American Camp, San Juan Island - with 2 distinct nicks on the anterior portion of its dorsal fin. Also saw lots of small juvenile salmon in the strait, he believes were coho. And another interesting note that J pod has been seen in Rosario Strait 8 times during the last 12 days.
Saturday,
