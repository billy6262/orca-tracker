Shane Aggergaard of Island Adventures called in this report: L pod inbound in the Strait, near Sooke this morning, then off the Victoria waterfront around 4 pm. J pod made their circular route through Rosario strait, then were headed out the Strait of Juan de Fuca toward L's at 4, porpoising toward them for the big family reunion. No positive ID's of K's yet, but they are possibly with L's as well. The Summer Superpod Season is here!!!!
