A call from Howie who was on San Juan Island to do a presentation last night......he was out with Ken Balcomb, Dave Ellifrit and Candi Emmons of the Center for Whale Research, and with J's, K's and most of L's, off the NW side of San Juan Island.....I could hear the blows over the phone, almost like being there but not quite!
