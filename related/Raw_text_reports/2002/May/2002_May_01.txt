Orca Sightings for May 1, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Ken Balcomb of the Center for Whale Research called us from the Keystone/Port Townsend ferry at
10:57 am, & said one of the passengers had just seen an orca, mid-channel.

Two gray whales off East Point (Whidbey Is.) on the evening 1 May. I identified both as being animals we have seen since the early 1990s. ID-49 or Patch has a large white depigmented area behind the dorsal hump predominantly on the right side although a small amount is visible from the left. The other ID-53 is also fairly distinctive with a smaller oval white depigmented area on the L side. These two were joined by a third whale just at dark, which I could not positively identify in the field. Given the low disappearing light I had to approach these closer than I normally try to do in order to confirm ID and obtain photographs. I was in a small white inflatable boat, in case anyone was watching and curious who I was.
