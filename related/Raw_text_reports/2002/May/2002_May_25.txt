Orca Sightings for May 25, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Besides the usual sightings of Orcas and Minkes, our vessel Olympas reported seeing two Humpbacks off Sooke at 1300
May 25. They were heading South.

L pod off Victoria early 0745 going to Race Rocks was on scene myself at 1042 just W. of Sooke with L41 ,L57, L58 and the 3 growing boys L73, L74 and L75. Still no new calves for me.
The afternoon trip we had a female and calf Humpback pair, the first Humpback for me in 3-4 years. 3 miles S. of Sheringham Pt. (west of Sooke).
I trust you have updates on J's and K's my reports were between the top end of Rosario St. and Pt. Roberts this afternoon.

L pod west-bound past Victoria, last seen past Otter Pt, still headed west toward the coast.
J's (& possibly K pod as well) were going outbound through Active Pass at
10:30 am. Dan Wills of Eclipse Charters saw them at Pt. Roberts, headed south. There was another group about 10 miles north of J's, also heading south (K pod?). A Vancouver whale watch company reported whales on their way back near Steveston, most likely K pod.
And Shane reported a minke whale near Misha on their way back in as well.

Hi Susan et al. -
It seems like J pod has slowed down for a bit after the fairly speedy travel the last few days - we were with them this afternoon (
1:00 p.m.) for about an hour at Pt. Roberts where they were doing quite a bit of milling, traveling slow, breaches, taillobs...a few hours later (
3:30 p.m.) they were reportedly still in the same area.
On my way home on Lummi tonight at
7:30 p.m. spotted them (I'm assuming it was same pod - they were quite far off shore) off west side of Lummi Island. They were milling out there in mid-channel and taking their time. Lovely day...
