Orca Sightings for January 12, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
11:00
At long last after reading all the reports of whales, we had a small pod of Orcas (five or six) pass by South Pender. They were very close, but we could not identify them. They passed by a group of rocks that we have seen transient whales take seals from but no action today!

14:00...two orcas just north of Lime Kiln headed south. They were far off shore. Thought to be one male and one female.
More than 2, with a young male according to Ken Balcomb. He thinks about 10 but pretty far off shore.

Dear Howie and Susan,
At 1341-1412 today (Jan 12) we had about ten orca southern residents heading south in Haro Strait.

Hi Susan:
The residents today were heard on the Smuggler's Cove hydrophone at
13:20, and I started picking them up at
14:06 from the lime Kiln hydrophones. The bulk of them, 10+, went by Lime Kiln at
14:30 heading south. From the calls K-Pod was definitely present, but I don't know who they were traveling with.
