Hi Susan:
We had a sighting of 11-15 orcas going North off Maury Island ( SE of Vashon Island) at
12:45 (Jan. 2nd).

Then at
13:18 we had a call with a report of a lone male orca due west of Shilshole Bay, first heading south, then turning & heading north. It had a large dorsal, with a notch or nick near the base of the trailing edge of the fin. This report was from Scott Mitchell, aboard the Jeffrey Foss - thanks to our partners Foss Maritime for joining in on our Sighting Network!

Then from Jeff Hogan in Seattle:
Hi Susan,
Spent the afternoon with a pod of North bound Orcas off the Discovery Park area near Seattle. 95% sure it was J pod but they were on the Bainbridge Island side and very spread out. Saw at least one group of six and only one male, we assume J pod but cannot say conclusively as the water was a bit rough. Caught a few breeches and some lunging. Picked them up at
4:07p and left them at about 520p still slowly heading North. They may have headed in to the Port Madison area, Northern tip of Bainbridge Island, but too dark to say. Great way to spend the 1st couple of days with our friends in town. Hope someone else catches a glimpse.
Best for the New Year.

It's been a busy day in the whale world today, so I'll start with the report of a stranding of orcas inside the Dungeness Spit near Sequim, follow it up with a variety of whale reports, and tomorrow will catch you up on the latest stranding details & other news that is happening in the orca world.
First, as many of you may have already seen on KING & KIRO TV tonight, a dead female orca was found near Dungesness Spit, & another male orca was inside the spit in shallow water. The male orca was helped out to deeper water, but as dark came on, he was still inside the spit & swimming slugglishly. We are awaiting confirmation from whale experts on site as to what type of orca (transient, resident, off shore), & the ID of the whale. We do know that transients were in that area on Dec. 31st & Jan.1st, & most initial reports seem to make it appear it is a transient pod, but until we get confirmation from officials on site there are no details other than the confirmation that it is an orca. A Necropsy will be performed tomorrow morning, & most likely a positive ID will be released by then. We will let you know as we hear more, & will also keep the latest news posted on our website, www.orcanetwork.org. Also, check the late evening & morning news with KING & KIRO as well - they are running it as the lead story.
Susan & Howie
Tuesday,
