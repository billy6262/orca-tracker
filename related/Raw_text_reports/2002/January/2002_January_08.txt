Orca Sightings for January 8, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Brad Hansen of NMFS for clarifying the info. I sent out earlier, & filling us in with a lot more detail in regard to tracking the rescued transient orca out the Strait - read on for some interesting info!

Hi Susan
Your last message had a bit of mis-information I would like to correct, and pass on a few more details that may be of interest. The tag placed on the male on Friday has a VHF radio transmitter - not a satellite linked transmitter - as well as a time/depth recorder. It is attached with a suction cup - this is the tag system that Robin Baird had used on killer whales in this area . I did get signals from this transmitter on Sunday night at about 2200. I was monitoring from a clear-cut at an elevation of about 1200 ft just SW of Neah Bay. VHF signals are only audible when the antenna is above the surface of the water (saltwater grounds out the transmission of the signal). Because VHF signals are line-of-sight, the range is greater at higher elevations. Signals were strongest to the SW. I listened for about 2 hours because I would only get one or two beeps every few minutes. Because routine background interference can mimic single beeps I was able to confirm that this was the transmitter signal by slightly detuning it on the receiver, as well as noting that the two beeps received occasionally sounded about one second apart, the pulse rate for the transmitter. If the tag had been off the whale the antenna should have been above the surface of the water fairly frequently resulting in more frequent signals. I would occasionally get a signal of relatively good strength. I would estimate the distance to the tag at 10-20 miles. Based on my experience working with Robin Baird on deployments of these tags, I suspect the tag slid back on the side of the whale, somewhere around the saddle - we have seen this occur numerous times. In relatively calm conditions, the transmitter antenna would probably be in contact with the ocean, likely explaining why I did not get a signal Friday evening as he traveled out the Strait of Juan de Fuca. However, on Sunday night with about 40 knots of wind blowing, there were likely some rather large troughs in the ocean when he was surfacing, such that more of his body cleared the water and the antenna was periodically dry. I suspect that if the tag is not already off by now, it will be soon - the record is 6 days. We will continue to try to find and recover it as weather permits - there could be some dive data that would be of interest to us.
Cheers
Brad Hanson
