Entry 1:
Special report
L98 is Alive & Well!! but this doesn't solve the Vashon Calf Mystery...
Dear Sighting Network -
We just received this report from John Ford and Graeme Ellis of Canada's DFO Pacific Biological Station - I'm sure you'll find it amazing!!
This is especially thrilling to Howie and I, because when L67 was first seen with her new calf L98 in September, 1999, it was Howie's first time back to San Juan Island after being in Miami for 2 years. We hadn't seen any whales while we were up there, but just before we had to leave L67 paraded by with her brand new baby! So that calf was very special to us, and was sort of like Howie's welcome back. After mourning the calf's disappearance, this is certainly whalecome and happy news! The Southern Resident Community's population grows by 1!

Dear Susan,
A most unusual situation has developed here in British Columbia, which I think will be of considerable interest to the network. Since
July 2001, a lone juvenile killer whale has been residing in a remote inlet on the west coast of Vancouver Island. It came to our attention in September, but we were unable to photograph it for identification until November. We have confirmed, with the assistance of the Center for Whale Research, that the whale is L98, a member of L pod born in 1999. This whale was not present with L pod when censused in June, 2001.
We have not made this situation public until now in consideration of L98's well-being. We were initially quite concerned that the whale would not obtain sufficient food as winter approached, and potential disruption from curious boaters would not help the situation. However, so far he seems to be doing quite well. We have observed him catching salmon, and he is showing no signs of emaciation. We plan to continue regular field trips to the west coast to monitor L98's health status. Fisheries and Oceans will undertake conservation and protection patrols as required to ensure the whale is not disturbed. In the meantime, we will continue discussions with our colleagues to develop response strategies should the juvenile's health deteriorate.
The L98 situation is the first time that a young resident whale has been found separated from its pod for a significant length of time. (A somewhat similar incident took place in the late 1970s, when an unknown, young killer whale in poor health was found at Campbell River and was ultimately taken into captivity at Sealand in Victoria...the whale came to be known as 'Miracle'). We have no idea how L98 came to be alone in this inlet, but he seems reluctant to leave. The situation is particularly interesting given the recent occurrence of the lone (as yet unidentified) juvenile in Puget Sound. There is no evidence that the two events are related. We'll provide updates to the network on L98's status as things develop.
Best,
John Ford and Graeme Ellis
