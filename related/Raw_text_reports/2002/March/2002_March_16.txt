Orca Sightings for March 16, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
[9 AM]
Spouts off Northwest corner of Mutiny Bay (west side of Whidbey Island), moving north. Seems to be only one whale. Seeing little of the animal---the roll with small nub instead of large fin. Now seems to be two. No Tail like I've seen before. Let me know what I'm seeing. Have seen tail when they were Grays before.
