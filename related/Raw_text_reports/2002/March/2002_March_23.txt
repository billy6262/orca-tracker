Orca Sightings for March 23, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm pretty sure I heard what sounded like two grays spouting last night (
March 23) at around midnight in Saratoga Passage, near the entrance to Holmes Harbor.

Dear Susan and Howard,
As we headed North got the word via Jim Maya via Ron Bates that the K's were coming down Boundary Pass. Jim left the dock at
13:00 and found them at Kellet Bluff about a half hour later. They were spread out in small groups for several miles. One had five or six Dalls playing in front of it for a mile or more. Later, we spotted Ruffles, J-1, so that confirmed they were J's. It was a great day. Such a contrast to the trip I did last Monday with a couple of Hard-Core friends. Today I got sunburned instead of windburned.
The whales did some feeding and some blackmouths did some jumping. Looked like little six pounders. Say hello to the grays in your neighborhood.
