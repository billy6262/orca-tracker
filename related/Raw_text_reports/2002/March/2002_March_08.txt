Forwarded from Capt. Jim Maya: Briefly, about a half hour ago (approx. 10 am), when it was clear, whales were spotted, (large fins,) by Carla and me below a little out from shore. Then we lost them, but nice to know they are around. Helen, San Juan Island

Then at approx.
4:30 pm, Howie and I watched a gray whale in Saratoga Passage, off Greenbank (Hidden Beach area) traveling south mid-way in the channel. Beautiful to see and hear its blows on the calm water!
