Orca Sightings for March 4, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Not a very scientific observation but I was JUST watching a slow moving whale, I believe to be our first Gray at
17:25 3/04/02. He/she was heading west along the Saratoga Passage by Sandy Point, (towards Langley) mid-way across the Passage between Sandy Point and Camano.
I say I believe it to be a Gray because the blow was quite large although the animal barely broke the surface. And, as I mentioned, it was moving rather slowly unlike our friends the Orcas.
Take care.
