Orca Sightings for March 21, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
This is a 2nd hand report - The Port Townsend Marine Science Center got a call about 1/2 hour ago (
2:30ish) that a group of Orcas were seen near the Port Townsend Ferry Terminal heading south toward the PT Paper Mill.

Sarah Schmidt of the WSU Beach Watchers was on the Keystone/Port Townsend ferry at
2:25 & saw the pod of orcas - she counted at least 19, but talked to others who thought they saw 30-40 whales. Sarah saw at least 3 male dorsals, and at least one small calf. She watched them until
3:20, said they were by the Port Townsend Marina, close in at times, crossed Ft. Worden, and then were headed out.
