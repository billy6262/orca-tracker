Hi Susan;
I had an Orca report at
7:45 this am from a ferry: killer whales in Georgia Straight heading north (towards Nanaimo I was told), not far out of Active Pass. (maybe the transients that were up there yesterday?)
Cheers

Two grays heading south were seen at 5pm from Bells Beach (Saratoga Passage, just east of the entrance to Holmes Harbor, south of East Pt). Wonderful! Peggy

Hi Susan and Howie: I just saw 3 Greys moving west from East Point to an area just North of Baby Island (Saratoga Passage, off east Whidbey Island). The weather was perfect at first--calm and sunny--and it was a treat to see them. It is much rougher now with a W. wind blowing and I haven't seen a spout for l0 minutes now.

A gray was in Saratoga Passage this morning from about
6:30 to
7:30 when the tide started out. Probably longer but I only woke up at
6:30. Three miles north from Langley (SE Whidbey Island); quarter mile south of Bell's Beach.

9:25am, 3 pair of grays headed south through the Saratoga Passage near Maple Cove (by Sandy Pt, south of Langley, Whidbey Island).

Hello and Happy Monday,
Just had a 1/2 hour of wonderful gray whales (~
9:30). There were 4 and it appeared one may have been a smaller one (calf?). They did their water ballet act in the Saratoga Passage and we saw them rolling and slapping and sounding. It was marvelous. From here, between Sandy Point and Camano, they headed towards Clinton. Hope someone picks up on them.
Jennifer in Sandy Point
