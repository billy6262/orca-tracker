Dear Susan and Howard,
Just warming up from a cool day on the water. Found eight or nine Orcas at Turn Pt., Stuart Island around
13:00 today. Saw a big male so assumed it was J-pod, but nothing fit, longer dives and more pointed dorsals. Got closer, scanned with binoculars and identified T-87. Followed them south and saw lots of Dalls porpoises around. Even broke off from the Orcas to try and lead the Dalls away. Jim Maya arrived with Dalls playing in his bow. They all seemed unconcerned about the transients until one transient knocked one clear out of the water! All of us, Jim and two Prince of Whales boats, had our jaws hanging open. The transients had their jaws busy. Left them at
15:00 or so heading south down Haro Strait.
Take Care,

Jim Maya also called in a report of the Transient pod, including T-87, and the story of the Dall's porpoise being thrown in the air, also reported LOTS of Dall's - up to maybe 100?!!
Monday,
