Definitely a cool day on the water. J's and L's heading North to Active Pass. Met them around Pender and watched them feed. It took awhile for them to decide to head up Swanson, but they finally did. Lot's of vocalizations, once the freighter traffic cleared. Nice Dalls ride on the way home and plenty of animals on Spieden.
Cheers,

Susan, ...early afternoon. Sighted group of Orcas off North West tip of San Juan island heading North. Lots of whale watching boats around. The Orcas headed to turn point, and continued North lots of breaching, and tail lobbing.
