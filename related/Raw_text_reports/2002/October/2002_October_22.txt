Orca Sightings for October 22, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
We just had an encounter with all of Lpod heading north past the house. We left them at Kellett Bluff still heading north. We saw all but about two L whales but the whales were spread out in mixed matriline groups so I'm not worried at all about the two whales we did not see. There was lots of foraging activity and all the sprouters (seems like lots!) had sex on their brain. The exciting news is that
there is indeed a new L pod calf (L101!)
and L67 seems to be the mother!! L67 and calf were in a active mixed group of mostly females. L54 and L100 were close by. L67 seemed very relaxed and approached the boat with calf in tow on several occasions. The new kid also has an open saddle on the left side! None of the other potential new mothers had anything little near them but there is still hope that we will get more new calves this winter. Hope all is well with you all.
