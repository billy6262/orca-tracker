Orca Sightings for October 26, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
...5 Transient Orcas traveling between Oak Bay and Trial Is., near Victoria. Right before we got there they had made a kill, (most likely a Harbor Seal) and were pretty excited. So were the birds going after the leftovers. They were jumping and vocalizing a good deal. I heard that they were headed west at Race Rocks by late in the afternoon. We also saw lots of Dall's Porpoises, an Elephant Seal, a Minke, and a ton of birds on our late afternoon trip.
