Orca Sightings for October 1, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
Wanted to report sighting of a large orca pod or pods in Puget Sound west of Ebey's Landing, north of Coupeville about

6:30 pm
. There were about 20-25 traveling together at a high speed from south to north. I imagine others saw them as well but thought you'd like to know!

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters just called (

12:30
) to report LOTS of orcas traveling north between Pt. No Point and Possession Pt. (northern tip of the Kitsap Peninsula and the southern tip of Whidbey Island).
Please keep a look out for these whales, and let us know if any of you get photos with a zoom video or telephoto camera lens - ID's are important these days with offshores around the area!
The orcas are in an area where there are many opportunities to view them from shore - so get out your binocs and scopes and let us know what you see -

What a day! After Tom McMillen's call this morning, we headed out to look for the whales. Found them off Double Bluff in Useless Bay sometime
before 1 pm
. LOTS of whales, as Tom had reported. By then, he'd ID'd them as J's, K's, and part of L's (L2's, L9's & L12's not present). We watched from the Double Bluff Beach Access for awhile, then went to the north side of Double Bluff, where they rounded the corner real close to shore, in tight groups, and we watched in awe for over an hour until a
bout 3 pm
. We observed over 20 breaches, lots of lob-tailing, spy-hopping, active behavior.
Then we continued north to Bush Pt, where we watched them come by, close in again, hearing their blows and watching more breaching, active behavior. After watching for about 30 minutes from Bush Pt, we continued north to Lagoon Pt, to watch them come by again, until
about
4:20
. More active behavior, some coming in very close to shore.
They continued north, some going into Admiralty Inlet, some stretched out across the Strait. We went up to Ft. Casey and watched from there until nearly
6 pm
. They were closer to the Whidbey side than we've ever seen them, and so many whales you couldn't count them all! We watched their blows in the sunset as they headed north toward San Juan Island, in a huge line that stretched half way across the strait.
Six hours of watching the whales today - I couldn't have asked for a better birthday present!! And we counted almost as many breaches as I am old......I won't say how many that is, except that it's well over 30!! We also observed some salmon breaching, and fisherpersons along the shore said the coho were running. We saw lots of harbor porpoise as well, including a breaching porpoise at Double Bluff!

They are jumping and swimming closely followed by one boat and they just picked up two more boats. At least one with a really tall fin. Must be the ones that the news said were south of here earlier in the day.
what fun

Thanks for the alert about whales.I did not find them at noon, but they showed up at Ledgewood Beach at

4:15
. They were just cruising along until a small whalewatcher boat and 2 other small boats appeared. Then they put on a marvelous show--spy-hopping, slapping, lobbing and a couple of full breaches. It appeared they were showing off for the audience. One group of about a dozen, including a male, followed by 6 others I was a mile away, so cannot offer any I.D. However channel 5 had an item tonight about whales off Kingston, and had a good picture of one. These whales took about an hour to pass, and ended up at Ft Casey, very close to the ferry inlet.
