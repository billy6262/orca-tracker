Orca Sightings for July 18, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Susan, yesterday (
July 18) with members of all three pods in Rosario was the most amazing day this year. I don't know if we are projecting, but it seemed to both Cindy Hansen and I that our whales are happier and healthier this year, although there is no scientific basis for this, just behavior observation.
