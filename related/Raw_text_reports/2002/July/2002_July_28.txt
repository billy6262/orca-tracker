============================================================

Entry 1:
Well, a number of Lpod whales south end of San Juan Is. in the morning. Jpod and it seems Kpod going south west in Boundary Pass 1045. At 1458 I was with what at first seemed to be a "Superpod". Late report states the L12's were not present but going west towards Sooke at 1330 from Beechey Head (west of Race Rocks).
