Orca Sightings for July 6, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
I'm on San Juan Island right now and just had a FANTASTIC day at Lime Kiln! J and K pod were going south at
11:30am this morning.. then at
1:40pm J's were back, heading north and came in close to shore and played in the kelp. Very playful, spread out, with about 30 boats around. Then at around 4pm, K's were heading south again and they just swam on by. Great day to be at Lime Kiln all day, with lots of people using the park to watch the action!

At approx.

8:15 - K pod from the south end of Lopez Island. They were spread out and milling, heading south toward Whidbey, but then there was a breach, and within 5 minutes they'd changed direction and were heading NW. L pod was reported off Race Rocks at
7:15 pm, and earlier in the day, J's were reported off the west side of San Juan Island near the Center for Whale Research at
3:45pm.
