Orca Sightings for July 14, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
At
10:00 am a group of more than 20 Orca going north passed close by Mouat Point on North Pender Island in Swanson Channel. The pod was lead by "Wavy" [Ruffles - J1?] up near the front. Our hydrophone recorded a few vocalizations but the entire group were quite quiet and were likely foraging for food. Over half the group were within 15 yards of the shore line and provided a spectacular show of nature at its best. Only two boats watched from the water and they stopped their motors and were gentle in their observations.
