Orca Sightings for June 9, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
A report on A73 from Sunday,
June 9:
Susan and Howard,
I was on the ferry this morning around
11:30am.. and got to see A73 Springer for my first time finally! She was hanging out at the stern of the docked "Evergreen State". She was mostly just lounging there, and doing a couple rolls, waving her pecs, and what seemed to be rubbing against the stern of the ferry. But that was all. Got some pics... she sure is loved by many who saw her. Definitely heard alot of concern about the fate of our S. Residents as well. We were heading into SouthWorth so we got to see her a little bit longer then when you just take the Vashon ferry.

Two guests in my B&B on Maury Island (south Sound, near Vashon Isl.) reported to me this morning that they had seen a mom and babe orca at Point Robinson,
June 8. Seems like an unlikely timing for orcas to be here. Anyone else see them?

And Shane Aggergaard called in an update to
June 8th's report - K pod went up the west side of San Juan Island in the afternoon, turning around at Lime Kiln, at Bird Rock at 6pm, and at

7:30 - 8 pm met up with J pod at Salmon Bank (so. San Juan Isl.)

And another Sea Otter report from Kathy Fletcher: Hi Susan-- A friend of mine who lives on the Sound between Seattle and Tacoma said that they had a SEA otter in their area for quite some time. I tried to convince her that it must have been a river otter, but she knows her stuff, and is very sure. She said that others, including wildlife agency folks were also sure. So maybe it's time to do a definitive report on who has seen what sea otters when and where in the Sound.--Kathy
