Orca Sightings for June 22, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Kpod off the West side with most of Lpod in the morning, in the afternoon a split.
K's went south and many Lpod whales went west toward Beaumont Shoal stopped and milled.
In the early evening Jpod came down Boundary Pass, Lpod off Victoria going S.W. no late reports of K's.
I have no reports of transients today.

We left J Pod heading south toward Lime Kiln at
8:30. They didn't want to be late for the concert.

On Saturday,
June 22nd, we found J pod right off Snug Harbor, headed south. Went out with Ken Balcomb to see them as they went by, then went back to the dock and drove down to OrcaSing at Lime Kiln State Park, where J pod went by at around
8:45, still headed south.

Met up with J's heading south as we came out of Mitchell Bay at 1925 and traveled south with them to Deadman's Bay where the Orca Sing was going on. Moving rapidly and had several spyhops from J14, and J37 at Deadman's Bay. Didn't catch any wheeze from J1 this time.
