Hi
Not out myself in the am but K's and L's off the west side of San Juan Is. L's came in in the early am from the west. Met a number of Lpod whales going N. as we were crossing Haro St. in 4-5ft. seas, time was 1445.
Kpod and the rest of L's south of False Bay at that time.
Jpod in upper Rosario St. at 1500 hrs. going S. (that was my report, not sure).

Spent a wonderful afternoon with J's in Bellingham Channel near Anacortes despite the rugged weather yesterday - they were swimming slowly against the tide and staying in the same spot for a good hour and a half - lots of swimming upside down and rolling around and yes, a few sea snakes as well! frisky youngsters i presume.
