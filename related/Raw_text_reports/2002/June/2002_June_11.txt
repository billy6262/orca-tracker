Orca Sightings for June 11, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi
Odd day! Lpod (most of) were in the fog this morning in the South, they went West in the afternoon past Race Rocks and beyond. Kpod on the west side in the am, went into Boundary in the afternoon and vanished into Georgia St. in the late afternoon N.E. of East Pt. My early info was Jpod off the Fraser River around 1100 but Capt. Maya found them off Pt. Roberts going N. at 1914, no idea were they had been.
