Orca Sightings for June 8, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi there,
I wanted to add to the glowing reports of the superpod on
June 8th. We were hanging out with K pod until they met up with J and L near American Camp, and then the fun began. We witnessed some of the same behavior from Cappuccino, and I'm hoping we got a good identification photo of the female he was romancing. Vicki, we'll have to compare notes and photos. As for Ron's question about L12's, we did see them hanging around our boat for awhile before they moved away, so they were definitely present. I was also encouraged by the behavior of the boaters. I heard very few motors running and it appeared as if the whales were being given plenty of room to do their thing. It was a great day.
