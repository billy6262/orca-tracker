And we had the pleasure of being out with K pod in the afternoon yesterday with Island Adventures. They were along the west side of San Juan Island, in the Hannah Heights to False Bay areas. They were very active and wonderful to watch - a cartwheel, several tail slaps, some great spy-hops, and lots of milling back & forth.
