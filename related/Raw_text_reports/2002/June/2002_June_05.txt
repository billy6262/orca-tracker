Orca Sightings for June 5, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Lpod going east off the Victoria waterfront in the morning.
Kpod in Haro St. and a report of J's in Rosario.
In afternoon the water S off False Bay made observations almost impossible, did get a quick glimpse of Lpod and I understand K's were there.
