Orca Sightings for June 25, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Last evening around
8:00 PM Capt Erik Schorr and Naturalist Katie Jones and guests were with J,K and L, a bit North West of San Juan Island. And boy, were they vocal last night. Capt. Erik phoned Bill and I at home. He had the cell phone near the hydrophone so that we could hear what was going on. The orcas were chattering, singing and carrying on and on and on. So much to say. What a treat. (Wish we were on that trip, but the vicarious experience was a fun one).
