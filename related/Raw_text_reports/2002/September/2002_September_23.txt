An awesomely stellar afternoon with J's in Swanson Channel and thru Active Pass - a "trip and a half" for all, noboby wanted to go home! The whales were rambunctious, "tumbling" around each other, cartwheeling, breaching, and also seemed very "relaxed" in the warm afternoon sun, kelping, lazily tail-lobbing, swimming upside down, spy-hopping....ahhhh....
and a P.S. - we were with J's,K's,L's on
Sept. 8
thru Active Pass - one of the coolest things I've ever seen - as one B.C. ferry came thru the pass (not slowing down much) a group of J's (12-15 whales) galloped over behind the ferry and surfed its wake for about 7-8 minutes!!
