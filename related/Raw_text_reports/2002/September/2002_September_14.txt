Saturday they appeared north of Ladysmith at Yellow Point headed very slowly north. This day they appeared relaxed and traveling slowly until they got close to Dodds Narrows. When they all decided to go through, they did this at high speed which made for great photos and video. For those of you wondering how far north we were, Dodds Narrows is about 5 miles south of Nanaimo.
Some trivia , once we were north of Sansum Narrows, the sea temp felt warm enough to swim in.
