Orca Sightings for September 17, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Springer sighting from
OrcaLab's Orca-Live

Entry 2:
16:24:00 PDT The A30s led the A5s, I15s, ?G18s, A11s and ?I33s north through Blackney Pass. We clearly saw A73 next to A11. We saw no other A4s and believed the rest stayed in the Strait with the A12s. There have not been a lot of calls from the Strait since so we are unsure as what direction they ended up going. The others seemd to be heading west now and their calls are getting more distant. They were doing quite a bit of quick foraging as they flew past the Lab.

Susan, I was out on the West coast last week and ran into a group of Orcas off the West side of San Juan island on Tuesday the 17th. They were headed North and spread out fairly good, they past Stuart island and some headed East from turn point, while it appeared that others continued North, towards the Penders.

Hi Susan
Lpod off the S. part of San Juan Is. most of the day. J's reported off the Fraser River just before 1600. I did not see any K's but a few boats "thought they had." Things coming back to "normal."
