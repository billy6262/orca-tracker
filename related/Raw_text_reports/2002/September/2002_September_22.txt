Dear Susan and Howard,
A beautiful day. J's, K's and some of L's came down Rosario, past Cattle Pt, then turned somewhere around Lime Kiln Lt.. I went around the north end so had a bit of a drive to reach them at Middle Bank around
15:00. Heard that the offshores were clearing Active Pass and, later, were between Pender and Mayne.

Just had a wonderful trip with over 40+ orca, J, K and L were there. Went south and we finally were with them almost to the southern tip of SJ Island, out in the Strait. They were mostly foraging. Several groups of four and five. The weather was warm and no wind.
