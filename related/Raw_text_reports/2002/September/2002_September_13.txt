Entry 1:
Orcas were in Cowichan Bay yesterday (9-13) c.
3:30 PM (viewed by our Bold Bluff Retreat guests). They came by Bold Bluff (Salt Spring Island) in Sansum Narrows at 10 PM heading North. Then again there were big blows, slapping tails and swooshing sounds at 6AM this morning (9-14) - heading North.

Yesterday morning (9-13) my husband and I were out swimming in Saratoga Passage. (yes, we have wetsuits) Just down in front of Langley, I thought I saw a few big splashes that could only be made by a whale. I wasn't sure, but when we returned home I received a call from Gretchen Lawlor down the street saying she had seen us out there and seen the whale's tail splashing. Did anyone else see a whale yesterday? We are wondering if it could have been the lone humpback that's been sighted in the San Juans. Any more info on the
September 11 Orcas?
