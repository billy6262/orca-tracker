Orca Sightings for April 23, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Susan,
Coming back from lunch in Everett on
April 23 in our Classic Plastic, we saw a single gray at
2:40 PM rolling into a deep dive ENE of Hat Island in about 450 feet of water. Got a good view of the back going over and quietly the flukes slipped into the water, not to resurface within view. While we were watching for it to come up again, we saw a huge blow right off Camano Head, several miles away - too far for this whale to have gone in this time. I presume another grey, although no further sightings.

Hi, Susan:
Last night when going out on the deck around
2:45 am, I heard large splashing and blowing just at the base of the bluff of Meerkerk Gardens on the east side of Greenbank. After about 10 minutes of frolicking, they headed toward Baby Island- blowing sounds echoing across the moon soaked waters. My guess is they are greys, by the large sounds of the tails swimming away.

Hi Susan
No whales for me today but a dead "Blainville's Beaked Whale" came ashore on Maui yesterday. (
April 23).
