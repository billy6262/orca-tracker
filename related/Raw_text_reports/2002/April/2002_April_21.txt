Hi Susan-
11am ish this morning saw a mystery cetacean in San Juan Channel just in front of Friday Harbor. Three surfaces at quite a distance and then disappeared. Likely a minke. Delayed report from about a week back from Limekiln...incredible sunset, 8-12" salmon jumping everywhere (no exaggeration), and Dall's porpoise happily in pursuit in all directions. Watch a patch of water for longer than 30 seconds and you were guaranteed to see either a salmon or a porpoise, and often both. Glorious spring out here!

Today the rest of J pod was at the lighthouse around 1520 heading south-bound, medium travel. The whales were spread a bit, I saw J11, J27 and J31. J33, J14 and her baby J37, J1 and J8. Others slipped by without id. Some juveniles were spyhopping and breaching on the way down. The tide was kicking up a bit and it's windy today, compared to yesterdays pristine, sunny conditions. There was some direction changes around the Land Bank land, but they headed south for the most part. I left them passing Hannah at 1600.
Cheers!

A-73 report from Judy Lochrie: sunrise: Springer spotted from the Vashon ferry dock; report from a ferry worker

2:20 -
3:40 pm, looking but didn't see anything

3:40 -
5:30 pm, I watched Springer. She was very active south of the ferry path between Fauntleroy and Vashon. Several breaches, lots of tail slapping, rolling around, splashes galore.
