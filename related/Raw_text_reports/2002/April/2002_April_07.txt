Peter Hamilton of Lifeforce called to report the lone, friendly pseudorca (Wilma? Foster?) was off Twassen, BC and Point Roberts Sunday afternoon,
April 7th, and followed him back to the park where people enjoyed watching her. Peter said she was energetic and there seemed to be lots of fish around.

Hi,
We've had a wonderful gray whale day here at Sandy Point in the Saratoga Passage. The grays, at one time 2, other times 1 at a time, were in close to the beach all day. Whale watching boats abounded but were respectful of the grays and it was just a perfect day to watch. One gray, the largest, had a mostly white fin and seemed to be waving at us. The grays headed back and forth between Langley and Clinton for most of the day, beginning as early as
6:30 (altho' sadly we weren't up yet) until the most recent show, this evening at
19:00. What a day!

I was out kayaking about
4:00 pm Sunday and followed one gray for a while between Langley and Sandy Point, feeding as it went. About Sandy Point whale start to head towards middle channel and we parted ways. Not sure which direction it was headed.
