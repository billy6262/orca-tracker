============================================================

Entry 1:
Dear Howie and Susan,
We got a call from Jim Maya this afternoon telling us there were whales off Albert Head, west of Victoria. By the time we caught up at
5:10 PM they were a couple of miles west of Race Rocks. We saw three transients, T41, T41a and T44 still heading west off Church Point at
6:10 PM.

Hi Howard and Susan,
Our trip out today was super! We started with a California Sea Lion snoozing on a buoy. Watched a busy minke off of Salmon bank and Cattle Pass. We then received a report of transients off of Victoria. We were luck enough to observe T41, T41A and T44 off of Albert Head at Haystack Rock. They were cruising together in fairly tight formation. Once they went behind the rock, they doubled back and split up and started to work separately from different directions around the rock together. Very cool pack hunting behavior! We weren't as fortunate as the other boats in that we witnessed the stalking but no kills. The group made a kill on a seal or sea lion prior to our arrival and then after we had to head home, we could hear reports of their success in finding desert! We made it a triple header at Hein Bank when we saw Dall's porpoise in the distance. They were ready to play and came screaming in to ride our bow after we cruised by! We were honored by their company for a little over 5 minutes, enough time for everyone on the boat to get a chance to look over the bow. They were even taking turns. I would say we had approximately ten to fourteen Dall's, hard to keep count! NO hybrids today. All in all a great day with great sunshine. We are all looking forward to our trip with you on the 29th!
