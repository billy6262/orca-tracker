Orca Sightings for April 26, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
A large group of Offshore orcas headed into Johnstone Strait via Blackney Pass on Friday afternoon (
April 26) - they headed some distance to the east overnight & returned back to the west on Saturday morning, eventually heading "out" past Alert Bay. Graeme Ellis managed to dash up from Nanaimo to take ID photos & thought there were as many as 60 of them!
