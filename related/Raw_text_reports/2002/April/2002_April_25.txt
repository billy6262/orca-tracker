Linda Robinson of Camano Island called in a report of 4 orcas in Elger Bay (near Camano St. Park), circling and feeding. She said there were at least 2 tall fins. We have received a report in the past of Transients feeding in Elger Bay, and from the description and timing it sounds like this could also possibly have been transients.

Hi Susan: Just spotted a lone grey down by East Point. I didn't get a good look at it but an aluminum outboard with blue trim got a great view and pictures as the whale dove several times right next to his boat. When the whale headed East, the boater headed over your way. Anyone you know?
