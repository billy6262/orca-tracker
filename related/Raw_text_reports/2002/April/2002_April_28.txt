Orca Sightings for April 28, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi- Just spent about a half hour watching at least 2 grays mid channel slightly south of Mabana. There should be some happy tourists aboard a Victoria Clipper which was stopped dead in the water, with the grays blowing all around, and quite close! A second tour boat also stopped. The whales were slowing working their way south toward Langley.

Dottie Granger of Camano called in a report of 1 or 2 whales in Saratoga Passage, closer to the Whidbey side, approx. 1 mile north of Langley,
9:30 am, with one boat with them. She wasn't sure if the whales were grays or orcas, & called back later to say they she thought there were 2 - 3 whales, and that they might be orcas. But comparing the time & place of this report with the one above, it looks like she may have been seeing the same whales as Barbara.....which were reported as grays.

Doug McCutcheon of San Juan Island reported seeing 1 gray whale off Fort Ebey, NW Whidbey Island, while flying over. He also saw lots of porpoise off Smith Island as well.
