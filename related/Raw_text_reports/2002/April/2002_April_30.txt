Orca Sightings for April 30, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called in a report this morning of J pod off Hannah Heights, west side of San Juan Island, at
7:30 am. He was observing them from land, but believed that he saw J17 and her kids with them.

Hi Susan and All
Jpod and I am sure the reports have been flowing in but I find the big news is that J17, J28 and J35 have closed the distance apart from a "day" to about 1.5 miles
