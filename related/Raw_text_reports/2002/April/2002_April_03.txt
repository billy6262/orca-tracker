Hi- I'm taking this years Beachwatcher class her on Camano. I understand you are compiling info on grey whale sightings. We live on the south end of Camano, on the west side, overlooking Saratoga Passage and Langley. As our beach has lots of ghost shrimp, we frequently see the greys feeding. For a good half hour this morning, from
8:00 AM to
8:30 AM we watched 2 adult greys feeding extensively in front of our house, moving slowly from south to north up the shore. When you look at a map of Camano, Dallman Road is the most southernly road that cuts across the pan-handle from E. Camano Rd. to S. Camano Rd. This also corresponds with the Mabana Shores Road. Our actual address is 3302 Walnut Court, which is a block long culdasac a half mile south of Dallman Road/Mabana.

Bruce Bryson of Coupeville, Whidbey Island, called in a report of 2 Gray whales observed from the Clinton/Mukilteo Ferry. The whales were by Hat Island, heading east toward Mukilteo.

Four Transient orcas were reported in Oak Bay (north-east of Victoria) at
2:45 on Weds, by attendees of the Whale Watch Operators Meeting we were at!

John Ford and Graeme Ellis of DFO's Pacific Biological Station received a call on Weds. that a large pod of approx. 30 - 40 orcas, including 6 mature males, had been observed in the Nanaimo area - north of Gabrioloa Island, near Yellow Point. The whales were in the area Tuesday and Wednesday (4/2 & 4/3), and photos were taken, so we're hoping to get ID's for this mysterious group of orcas soon!

Amy Massey and family called in a great report from a Whale Watch tour they took on Weds. afternoon - including the group of 4 Transients off Victoria, which included T59, and two minke whales near Lopez and between Lopez and Anacortes.

Hello Susan,
Great news!! Orcas or Gray Whale Sighting at
5:34 pm,
April 3, 2002. Margaret and I sighted three (3) Orcas out in Useless Bay heading north toward Double Bluff. They were in no hurry. Looked like they were taking their time. We were on our deck at our house at Sunlight Beach and viewing the event with binoculars (several hundred yards). On second thought they may have been big grays because of the tremendous spout of water they blew (like a fire hose) as they frolicked in the sunny warm afternoon sun. Any way we ID'ed them beautiful free mammals.
