Orca Sightings for April 17, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan: I just saw the grey with the twin tail spots pass by (East Pt, Saratoga Passage) heading West (
8:30 pm). It didn't stop to feed. Judging from the feeding depressions in the sand there were 2 grays feeding out front last night (
April 17).

Hi Susan,
At about
2:00 this afternoon, 4/17, I was coming home to Fish Creek through Cattle Pass. I had been north at False Bay with about four orca. J pod I think, there was a male, 2 females and a calf. I didn't get close enough to the male to see if it was Ruffles, but J was seen at Lime kiln earlier that morning. But what was cool, on my return home, right off Goose Island were 4 more orca. ... Now there were about 10 or 12 orca.

Hi Susan,
At Cattle Point today at about 3pm saw a group of approximately 10 orca, maybe more, with one large male. They stayed on the Lopez side of Cattle Pass up until we couldn't see them anymore going north.

A lone gray surfaced right in front of me, not 20 yards off shore at
15:40 on 4/17 off Sandy Point in the Saratoga Passage. Had two prominent white markings on the tips of it's tail. Fed on the flats for about 20 minutes. Then headed towards Clinton for the ferry folk.
