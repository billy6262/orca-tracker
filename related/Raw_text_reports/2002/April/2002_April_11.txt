At

At 4 pm Mary Pacher called in 2 gray whales off east Whidbey Island, mid-Saratoga Passage off North Bluff/Greenbank area (right in front of our house.....- we weren't home, of course....) .
*
At approx 1705 saw a gray whale headed south in Saratoga Passage about five miles north of Greenbank.

At
5:45 pm Mary Pacher called to tell us there was a gray whale feeding in her front yard, just up the road from us ; ) Unfortunately we were up on San Juan Island, so we didn't get to see it.....but Mary said it was feeding 150' off the shore, so close she could see its eye!

Rich from Wash. State Ferries (Fauntleroy/Vashon/Southworth run) emailed us that they saw 4 - 8 orcas Thursday just north of Blake Island, heading north, one was a big one. No word of any encounter with A73 - anyone else happen to see them?

Note: The large "mystery pod" up north last week has been identified as Offshores (a population of orcas first discovered and photographed in the early '90's, that seem to travel in large groups 20 - 30 miles offshore, and thought to be fish-eating orcas that resemble Resident orcas in their group size) - here's the report from Graeme Ellis of Canada's DFO Pacific Bio. Field Station:

Hi Susan and Ron.....John and I are off to Alaska but wanted to let you know I've had a look at the photos Miriam O. and Linda Nichol took of whales off Crofton (Stuart Channel, east Vancouver Island) while we were all in the WWOANW meeting on
April 4, and also photos taken by 5 Star Charters off Cowichan Bay and forwarded by Ron. Both encounters were with Offshores, which certainly helps explain the large group sizes. If anyone on your network took any photos of these animals over the week or so that they hung around, we'd love the opportunity to have a look at them.
Cheers, Graeme.

We've had several reports of large groups of what were thought to be Transients in the Saanich Inlet area, as well as reports of a large group heading west off Race Rocks - let us know if any of you have any photos or more info. to share - thanks! There have been only rare opportunities for researchers to observe and photograph Offshores, since they are usually offshore in more stormy, difficult seas - Susan
