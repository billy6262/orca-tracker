Orca Sightings for November 15, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi
Was with a number of Lpod whales 2 miles S.E. of Race Rocks at
1242
. Not all of Lpod but a good look at L67 and calf, all the L9's many others spread out and feeding.

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters met up with K pod and possibly some members of the other pods around the Double Bluff area at
3 or
3:30pm
; but he stayed with K's to observe and photograph the new K pod baby to help ID the mother. He sent us a great photo, which we will have up on our website (www.orcanetwork.org) tonight, joining Tom's photo of the new L-pod baby on our homepage. He said the whales were spread out between Double Bluff (west Whidbey Island) and Pt. No Point (No. tip of the Kitsap Peninsula). They had been heading north-west, but turned around and headed back south-east. Tom left them at dark as they continued heading south between Possession Pt. and Kingston. So they could still be in the south Sound neighborhood today....let us know if you see them!

Susan,
We have just spotted a small group of orcas. It looks like there are 2 or 3 of them moving northward from the south tip of whidbey toward possesion. It is

10:45
. The water is completely calm right now, really good for seeing them.

Okay, another update.

11:00 a
m. It looks like there is a bigger group in the sound at the south end of whidbey. There may be quite a few out there (hard to tell they are surfacing at different times), and it looks like there is a very small one there too, maybe one of the new babies?

Hi Susan,
My husband Paul reported the earlier sighting of 4-5 whales this morning, and now it's my turn to e-mail you. It's

12:50 pm
on Friday, and they're back at the south end of Whidbey by Possession point. Yea! They're so cool to watch.
Thanks!

Hi Susan,
Sorry to keep sending message after message, but they're moving west now (

1:13
), and are south of Cultus Bay on Whidbey. They're almost out of our vision now.
