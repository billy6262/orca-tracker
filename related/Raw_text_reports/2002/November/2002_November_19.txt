Orca Sightings for November 19, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just received a call from Patti Newman of Vashon Island - who was fortunate enough to see a pod of orcas from the Vashon/Seattle ferry at

9:45 am
! She said they were close to the Vashon side, spread out, and heading south. She counted approx. 12 whales, including several males and a calf (sounds like L pod, who was last reported late Sunday heading into lower Puget Sound). Patti said the whales were very active with lots of breaching and tail-lobbing, and that the ferry passengers were treated to a great sight
*
Orcas were off Three Tree Point (on mainland, south of Alki, just east of Vashon Island) heading slowly North at about

1:30
. Hard to see from the Vashon side but should be excellent from West Seattle.

And we received a call tonight from Lynn Brevig of Vashon Island, who also had the pleasure of watching the orcas this morning from the
9:40 am Vashon Island/Fauntleroy ferry. She said there were at least 10 - 15 of them, and they were right in the ferry lane and close to the boat.
