Orca Sightings for November 16, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Four of us were sailing yesterday (Nov. 16) in Puget Sound and we saw about 10 Orcas including at least two juveniles. Sighting occurred at about

1:30pm
in the middle of the sound off of West Point. Whales were traveling NE across the sound from Blakely Rock towards West Point and then continued NW up the sound.

We received a call from Patti Newman of Vashon Island, who spoke with a young man down on Maury Island (southeast of Vashon Island) who watched a pod of ~10 orcas go past Pt. Robinson heading north at
11 am
.
