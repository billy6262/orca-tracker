8:05 am

8:20 am
: Deborah Heg of Greenbank called to say the orcas were going by, between Lagoon Pt. and Bush Pt, headed toward Bush Pt.

After missing the orcas yesterday, I was lucky today and able to catch up with them at Double Bluff - yippeee!! I first went to Bush Pt, and talked to a gentleman who had just watched them pass by - said there were several males and they were moving south fast. So I headed further south, and got to watch them as they passed south of Double Bluff, at about

9:20 am
. They were traveling in several tight groups, porpoising and traveling with a purpose! I also saw several males, and I think I saw the new baby - anyway there was a little one traveling real close to a mom, but they were too far out to be able to see the orange-tint that the new calves have. It was a beautiful sight in the morning sunlight, but they were traveling fast so it was short and sweet, and though I tried to catch them once more further south, they had already slipped by.

First, from Elsa at Bush Point: 1st message,

8:35 am
: Just saw the message, looked outside, and there they are.... 2nd message,

9:10 am
: There are lots and lots of whales. Might even be a superpod. (I must learn to identify.) I saw at least 4 adult males. The whales are spread out--a couple of groups that are staying very close together, and others spread out over probably a square mile. As yesterday, they are heading south with great purpose--I didn't see much activity other than swimming.

A whole group of Orca's heading South West of Mutiny Bay. Wow!! Looks like 20 to 30 of them...

Pod of about 15 to 20 headed south off Bush Pt./Windmill Heights at 900 am. Very active, breaching, tail slapping etc., tightly grouped. What a sight on a beautiful day. Don't know how to identify so will leave it up to others.

...we saw our first pod of orca whales (don't know which pod -- sorry!) just south of Whidbey Island on
November 1st around noon. There were at least 15 in the pod. They were heading east, and it looks like they cut north to go through the Possesion sound area (east of Whidbey). Several boats gathered around them before they disappeared out of our field of vision.
