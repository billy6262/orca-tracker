Orca Sightings for November 3, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Tom McMillen passed on this report from Chris Sly of Bainbridge Island:

10:30 am
he first saw the pod off the eastside of Bainbridge Island, where they traveled south to Winslow, then at a little after 11 they headed east toward West Point and Discovery Park. This is probably the same pod of L's and J's that Tom saw yesterday.

We received a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters - after reviewing the video he recorded of the orcas off Kingston yesterday, he reports that K pod whales were present as well - so it was a superpod of all three pods!

Susan,
At about

4:15 pm
today, we saw a group of orcas w/ at least one big male, moving from Kingston toward the south end of Whidby island. There were probably about 15 in the group, but they were pretty spread out.

Hi Susan,
WE GOT WHALES IN EDMONDS!!! They seem to come and visit when I'm out somewhere else looking for them. I've always wanted to see whales (3 blocks from my home! ) At

3:15
today, from the park to the left of the Edmonds Ferry dock we saw a lot of orca out in the sound. We could see them faintly with a naked eye but binoculars made for a magical moment. Breaches, splashes what an active group!
Best Wishes,
Kendall and Brian
Edmonds, Wa.
