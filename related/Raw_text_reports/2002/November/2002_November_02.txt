Orca Sightings for November 2, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Janet Hall and Nicole Luce of Freeland just called in a wonderful sighting of orcas off Double Bluff, west Whidbey Island, from

10:30 this morning
. They watched a large pod (22+) traveling north, but taking their time and appearing to be feeding in the current. They saw at least one large male dorsal fin. The whales were very active, breaching, spy-hopping, and tail-lobbing; and when a big cargo ship went by, they surfed in its wake!

Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to report a large pod of orcas off Kingston, near the ferry terminal. They were first headed south, then north, then appeared to just be milling around the area, feeding on fish. He said there's LOTS of whales, so far he's only ID'd L pod, including the new baby, L101.
