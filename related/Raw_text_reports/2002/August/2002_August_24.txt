Orca Sightings for August 24, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Great whale watching off Tsawwasen with Js first followed by Ks and Ls. Lots of socializing in calm waters off the South Arm of the Fraser. It was brief though, numerous boats arrived and did not follow the guidelines. Whale Watch Companies repeatedly blocked their path and some approach within 50 feet from the rear.
