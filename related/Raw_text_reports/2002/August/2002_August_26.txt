Orca Sightings for August 26, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
T41, T41A and T44 off Victoria once more, this time going West. I made contact at 1100 about 2.5 miles S. of Sooke. They were in hot pursuit of a Dall's porpoise at at time, the porpoise and T41A passed wthin 5ft. of the boat. The kill was made about 1107.
We move now to 1745 a point 10.5 miles S.W. of Sheringham Pt. A lone zodiac is the only boat on scene watching the 3 whales go W.S.W. when they realize the whales have swithched into hunting mode. It soon became apparent that a Cal. Sealion was the prey, after a while both the boat and whales lost the sealion. At 1815 the Sealion burst out of the water and landed one of the pontoons of the Zodiac, scaring the ---- out of the people. The animal fell back into the sea rather than the boat where it vanished again. A few minutes later it tried once again, this time hitting the radar arch at the back of the boat and going back into the ocean. The boat is now going Full astern to exit the area and the outcome was left to nature.
