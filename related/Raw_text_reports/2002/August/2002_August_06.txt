Orca Sightings for August 6, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
A great report was called in by Captain Neil of Captain Jack's whale watching from Port Townsend. They were with J's, K's & most of L's today at
1:30 off Cattle Pass, and he said the vocalizations were AMAZING! In both pitch and volume, way beyond anything he'd ever heard - they must have been having quite a party!
