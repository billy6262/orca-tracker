Orca Sightings for August 15, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan, wow what a great encounter this afternoon! I was down at Limekiln around 1630 and saw what looked like members of all three pods. Whales were spread up to 4 miles along the westside, slowly cruising northbound in loose family groups. Saw a bit of herding behavior. J1, L57, K13's, might have even seen L54 and L100. Everyone was back-lit so I was working off size and dorsal shape. When I drove down to the Landbank land the encounter got even better! L41 was tight with L77. L41 breached twice and then started to tail-lob. Others were milling in the kelp. As I walked down to the rocks, L58, L5 and L3 came right over between 70 and 100 yards away. There were a few whales kelping and some spyhops in our direction. There was even a nice vocal in air from a logging female. Last to come over was L71, L26 and L90 and in that group looked like L88, L2 and L67.
Take care,

9:30 p.m. Cliffside ??? Heading east. Too dark to tell numbers or pod, but it must have been several pods because they were noisy and close to shore.
