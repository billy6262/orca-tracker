Orca Sightings for August 27, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan,
I believe your transients entertained the fully loaded
10:00am ferry from Clinton this morning. The captain announced that orcas were ahead of the ferry just shortly after we left the Whidbey side. A number of car doors flew open and we all made for the sides of the boat to catch a glimpse. We were able to see them moving fast; playing and travelling north towards the south end of Hat Island. Probably the same group that visited you later in the day!

J, K and Lpods going east off Race Rocks at 1043. In the afternoon they had moved some to the east but a way south in fact to the US Navy buoy about 6 miles N.N. E. of Port Angles where at 1514 I had a great view of a Minke Whale. By 1600 the whales had turned and were going towards the Hein and Salmon Banks area.

Mike Bennett called us at
5:40 pm to report a strange and wonderful sighting of a pod of four Transient orcas at the mouth of Holmes Harbor, near Baby Island and heading north. We ran out and down to our neighborhood whale watching deck at Chris and Terry Rose', and finally found the orcas, now closer to the Camano side of Saratoga Passage. Neighbors John, Karen, Jake and Ellie Gervais came over to watch with us, and we were treated to an hour of whale watching in our own neighborhood!
The whales were very active, at first heading in all directions, diving and splashing, and I'm sure I saw a seal fly through the air at one point. They definitely looked like they were hunting and feeding. Mike reported that they had been very active when they saw them, too. There appeared to be three adults, one a male, plus a calf. Mike said they got great photos, so hopefully we can get some ID's.
After their active feeding frenzy, they took off headed north at a good pace, sticking to the Camano side of the passage. We left them as they were north of Cama Beach, still heading north.

Saw 3? orcas at
10:10am today, crossing in front of the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry, heading North at speed toward Saratoga Passage. Everybody on the ferry had a great view till they dived.

Hi Susan,
Just to expand on the transient Orcas sighting in Saratoga Passage... There were actually 3 adult females and one calf (thanks for the correction - they were far on the opposite side of the passage, and one of the fins looked pretty large, so we assumed it was a male - oops! sb). They appeared to have made a kill just before we got there but we didn't see what it was. They were pretty close to Baby Island so we're assuming it was a seal. They then became very active with a lot of lobtailing and breaching. They didn't seem at all concerned about the 2 boats in the area and went about their business as if they hadn't even noticed us. They spread out for awhile and almost seemed to be foraging for fish, then continued north. It was a fantastic show and a very special treat; especially for our passengers who had been taken all the way out to Race Rocks earlier in the day to see L pod. I think I have ID's on these guys. I want to e-mail my photos to the Center for confirmation but at this point I'm about 90% sure we were looking at T46 and T47 (who were captured and released in Puget Sound in 1976) along with T46B and a calf maybe 2 years old or so possibly belonging to T46B. I'll let you know if I get confirmation on those ID's. It was sure an exciting afternoon and I'm hoping they stick around for a few days. I'm so glad you got to see them.
Take care,

Pat Rasmussen of Leavenworth called in a report of orcas (not near Leavenworth!) heading north up the west side of San Juan Island this evening, getting up to the County Park area at about 7 pm, then stopping and milling around.
Monday,
