Orca Sightings for August 28, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
First, Benye Weber left a message at
5:50 pm, saying two orcas, one large and one small, were in Penn Cove, near downtown Coupeville, Whidbey Island, heading into the cove.
*
Then Val Arnold left a message at
6:30 pm, saying there were four orcas in front of their home on the northern side of Penn Cove (north of the Penn Cove Shellfish pier). She believes it may have been the pod of four Tranisents observed Tuesday in Saratoga Passage (and from Benye's description of an adult with a calf, this makes perfect sense). They were traveling west along the northern side of the cove.
*
And finally, a message from Elise and Bill Junkans, saying at
6:30 they had seen four or five orcas going north in Penn Cove, with no large dorsal fins (no mature males). They said lots of people were watching the whales from the shores of the cove.
*
My first reports were of Jpod going N. in Swanson Ch. at 0825 Other whales as the morning progressed going N.W. (K's and some more L's)
Contact with L12's at 1052 going S. from Eagle Pt. Second contact with L12's between Cattle Pt. and Iceberg Pt. at 1535 they were resting but still going slowly south. A minke W.S.W. of Hein bank at 1500.
