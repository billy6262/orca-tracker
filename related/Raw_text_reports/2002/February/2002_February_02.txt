Orca Sightings for February 2, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi All
The whales were transients, photos were taken but not by me, so will have to wait for most of the IDS but T20 was the only adult male. First report came in about 0930 and I last saw them at 1550 still off Vic. There seemed to be a disproportionate number of calves. As I said T20 was on scene and at least one report of T21 who had been missing the last two times T20 had been seen.

My daughter and I (and a hundred other watchers) spotted three or four orcas feeding right off of the Dallas Road waterfront in Victoria, near "Mile Zero" (Douglas and Dallas Rds.) They were there for a long time, at least an hour. We saw one breech during the time we were there.
Also in the vicinity (closer to shore) were two large groups of sea lions. They were also staying pretty much in place feeding. No whale watchers to speak of, just one private boat and a kayaker kept their distance.

And from Fred Felleman in Seattle:
Hi guys -
Dave Bain and I spent the afternoon with the Vashon whale. Mark Sears was out as well. Conditions were excellent so I got some good video and I see the film on Monday. David got some clicks and vocals on tape, but nothing he could use for ID.
Fred
Friday,
