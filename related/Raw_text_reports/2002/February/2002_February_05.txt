Orca Sightings for February 5, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
hi Susan,
wow, my first sighting of the year and it was incredible. I was out with a friend today at Cattle Point around 1430. J pod was tight traveling slowly through the rip tide, inshore around the point. There were no boats and no other humans around to speak of. The calves and juveniles were very social rolling, dorsal slapping and tail-lobbing. Then they reached a bird rookery and started foraging. Lined up 4-5 animals abreast and tail-lobbing, it looked like they were herding their prey. They continued to forage and travel slowly up San Juan Channel. I identified the J16's, J1, J8, J19, J34 and possibly the J17's.

And from Amy at the Whale Museum:
Hello -
We had 3 sightings of J-pod today! First they were seen moving south past Lime Kiln and Eagle Point in the morning. Around
15:00 there was a sighting of them moving North past Cattle Point - they may have been going up San Juan Channel but we've had no reports of that as yet.
