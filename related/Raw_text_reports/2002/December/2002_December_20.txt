Orca Sightings for December 20, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
We had another call from Mark Severson at Alki Pt. - saying the same pod they'd called about earlier had only gone north about 3 miles, then turned around and were milling slowly near Alki Pt. (just south of Seattle) again at

2:10 p
m.
*
We received a call from Rachel Severson, who reported a pod of ~12 orcas off Alki Pt. at

12:45
this afternoon. She said one male was present, so it could well be J pod, which was reported off Bainbridge Island yesterday (see report below). The pod was traveling north, so those of you in Seattle, Edmonds and areas north should keep a lookout for those fins swimming by, and let us know if you see them....'tis a beautiful day for seeing whales!
