============================================================

Entry 1:
Patricia Hillis called to say they'd seen two orcas off Restoration Pt. (near Blakely Harbor and Blake Island), headed south toward Vashon Island between

11:30 am and noon
today. They reported that one breached, and one whale surfaced near their boat.
