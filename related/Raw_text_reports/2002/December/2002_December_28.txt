Orca Sightings for December 28, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Just received a call from Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters, who had a report of orcas off the east side of Bainbridge Island (sw of Seattle) from Chris Sly at
about 3 pm
today. The whales were headed south, and later Tom heard reports on the radio of orcas off the south end of Bainbridge Island.

We received a call from Brett Barker of Southworth, who had seen a pod of orcas on Sat. Dec. 28th off Dalco Pt, the southern tip of Vashon Island, WA. There were 2 females, 2 calves, and a juvenile, and they were actively diving and circling near the surface. He said there were a lot of salmon around, but another boat nearby saw the same pod taking a seal, so it sounds like they may have been a transient pod.
