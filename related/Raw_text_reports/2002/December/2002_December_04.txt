Orca Sightings for December 4, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan - a bit late, but there were at least 10-12 orcas swimming rapidly north thru Saratoga Passage on 12/4. We saw them from the

4:00pm
ferry sailing from Mukilteo. I think there were at least two males judging from the dorsal fins we saw. Probably following the females who were on there way to Langley for Christmas shopping!

On Dec. 4th, at

3:30+ PM
, a ferry commuter friend reported that a group of about 20 orcas swam right under the Mukilteo-Clinton ferry, which had stopped in the channel to let them pass by. They were headed north at that time, so perhaps they circled Whidbey(?) or else turned around later. At

4:30+ PM
, a different ferry rider reported a smaller group of orcas playing off the point where the Mukilteo Lighthouse Park is--could they have been the rest of the super pod?
