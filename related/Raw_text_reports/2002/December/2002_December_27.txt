Orca Sightings for December 27, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
At
0815
this morning, I got up in time to hear southern residents (probably Js) on the hydrophone but I missed seeing them. They had already passed to the north. They were quite chatty and faded away after about fifteen minutes so they must have been moving along. Due to borderline sea conditions and an ominous weather report, we elected not to go out.
