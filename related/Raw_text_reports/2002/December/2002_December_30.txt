Orca Sightings for December 30, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Yes, we saw them at
8.15 am
crossing in front of the ferry, couldn't count them. They were heading south and quite spread out, on the move. Then the ferry driver? pilot announced that he could see some more over by the ferry Mukilteo dock. As the ferry got quite close to the dock an orca suddenly came up vertically with a tremendous noise, not 100 yards away on the right of the bow. And that was the last we saw of it.

Dear Howie and Susan,
at
1020
we received a call from KOMO TV that 20+ whales are off Clinton/Mukilteo ferry route (between so. Whidbey Island and Mukilteo on the mainland) now, 30 Dec.

It took me over an hour to find the pod off south Whidbey, but I finally found them from Glendale (south of the Clinton ferry dock) at

12:25
, and they were headed south between Glendale and Possession Pt, quite a distance out. At first they were in two tight groups, then at
12:3
5 they formed a line abreast for about 10 minutes, then broke up into smaller groups again. It was difficult to get a total count (as always!) but I estimated between at least 15 and 20 orcas, and saw at least 3 adult males, possibly 4, so maybe it was L pod?

At

12:30 pm
12/30/02 we can see two groups of Orcas totalling at least 11 fins, heading south. The're east of Whidbey Island off Possession Point Park, several miles south of Mukilteo, closer to the Island than the mainland.
