Hi, caught that pod at

10:45 AM
well past Pt. Wilson east bound between Pt. Wilson and Marrowstone. I would say 5-7 animals. I could see large spouts over toward your place but they were too far to confirm other than spouts.

Yes, they are midway down Marrowstone on the west side of Admiralty inlet. Too far from Whidbey to count, but did see one large male. Heading south.
