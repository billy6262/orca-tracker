Orca Sightings for December 11, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
This is a belated report. Last Wednesday,

Entry 2:
4:00 and
4:30 p.m
. We stopped because we heard lots of echolocating being broadcast over 89.1 FM. The orcas were in a tight group very close in. They appeared to be both feeding and playing. We saw three huge spyhops and one whale practicing its tail sailing. At around
4:30 p.m. the orcas began to move slowly south. L57 and L12 were clearly identifiable. There was another large bull which I assume was L41, but we never got a good enough look to identify him for certain. Best regards,
