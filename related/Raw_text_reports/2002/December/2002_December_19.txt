Orca Sightings for December 19, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hi Susan and Howie,
Around
1100
, I got another heads up call from Charlene Wendt and made it to the window in time to see the whales heading slowly south. I have no doubt that they were transients but I had never seen them before either here or in Alaska. They were not offshores or northern residents. There were 6 (absolute minimum) -8 whales with one bull and several juveniles of various sizes. There was one female that was a dead ringer for T68, the bull could have been a grown up version of the picture of T68A in the transient book. I think I remember seeing a tiny nick about 1/6 of the way down from the tip of his dorsal. There was another female with the same fin shape as T68B and a medium to large juvenile with the same fin shape as T68C. There was at least one more adult female and a few more kids so (if it was the T68's) either T68 popped out a couple more kids (T68 is described in the transient book as productive) or there was some extra whales in there (I suspect a bit of both). The whales headed down the west side of San Juan Island about a half mile offshore. At the south end of Mount Dallas, they began some high speed milling/chasing behavior so were obviously going after something but I was too far away to tell exactly what. It was probably a Dall's porpoise as there have been many around. It didn't really look like a pinniped attack. I think they made the kill since I saw gulls swooping down to pick up bits. The attack brought the whales close inshore along the rocks. Too bad it was in a place that was inaccessible from shore so unfortunately I got no photos. The whales vanished somewhere around Hannah Heights.

Hi Folks,
Just want to report a sighting of four (4) orcas on Thursday Dec.19, '02. They were inside Burley Lagoon at the head of Carr Inlet... the other side of the Purdy Spit (SE end of the Kitsap Peninsula, south Puget Sound). I saw them at
3:25 pm, swimming north between the shoreline and the towers standing in the water to carry high tension power lines across (the towers farthest west, an osprey nest on one of them).
They appeared to be four females or juveniles as there was no big male's fin among them. They seemed to have come in under the bridge with an incoming tide, and headed west towards where Minter Oyster Co. keeps their floats. There is a bit of a channel there. They then turned and swam parallel to the shore, heading towards the end of the lagoon, but sounded while still near the towers, maybe to feed. I never saw them again but watched till dark. It gets quite shallow in here, so I hope they got out! My neighbor has never seen orcas inside the lagoon here in 25 years.
Please feel free to write if you have further questions, and thanks for keeping an eye out for these precious creatures!

Susan and Howard,
Just checked my messages on my cell phone and had some interesting stuff there I missed yesterday. Cris Sly left me two messages of sightings on Thursday (Dec. 19). First, he saw eight transients by Port Townsend yesterday morning. From the description of the male it sounded like T 20 and 21 were in the group. He also said there were three small calves present and four females. Then when he got home to Bainbridge Island
about
1:30
theres J1 and J2 in front of his house. He said they were headed north. Then, I guess Dave had some transients headed south along San Juan Island yesterday. Orcas everywhere -

Hmm - we have some mysterious whale reports today - three different sightings within 2 hours of each other, all in different locations! First we had the group reported earlier today off Pt. Wilson heading west. Then Ken Balcomb reported a group of orcas (believed to be transients) heading south past the Center for Whale Research off the west side of San Juan Island at around the same time (
10:30 am). And then we receive this report of a pod off South Whidbey at
12:30 this afternoon - who are all these whales?! Let us know if you see them -

Susan,

My wife just spotted a group of Orcas (she always spots them first). They are just off of possession point (south west tip of Whidbey) headed west toward point no point! Looks like there are at least 5 there.
