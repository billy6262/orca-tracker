Orca Sightings for December 2, 2002
============================================================

Entry 1:
It appears the pods we saw yesterday off Whidbey have surfaced down in the Seattle area this morning. Tom McMillen of Salish Sea Charters called to say that KOMO 4 news showed shots of a small pod of orcas in downtown Seattle, near the Magnolia Bridge where their chopper was filming another story at 11 am this morning. And the Center for Whale Research had reports of K's & L's down in the Seattle area this morning as well. So you city folks keep your eyes open, and let us know where the whales are!
