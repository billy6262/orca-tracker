Orca Sightings for February 21, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
...At
1059 they encountered T102 on his own slowly heading east off of Constance Bank
. Mark and Hanna spotted more blows to the west and encountered
T101, T101B and the T100's
tightly grouped up and accompanied by
T60D
(where is the rest of his family?). They were doing a steady 7-8 knots. After shadowing them for a bit Mark and Hanna noticed that T102 was now traveling with T101A (his brother). These two male whales were doing 5 knots and they kept a good distance from the rest of the whales that were behind them. No predation events were seen though the two brothers were swimming through bait balls in Oak Bay flats and skulked around for a while. Mark and Hanna left the whales as the T100's and T101 with T101B had almost caught up to T102 and T101A to form a group off of Discovery Island before heading north in Haro Strait....See full summary report and more photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 17.

Received at 3PM:
A single large male at Vista Point, Irish Beach in Manchester, Calif
. The whale was south of us and appeared from behind the cliff/headland coming toward us. We saw the whale surface 5 times heading north. After the fifth surface, we didn't see it again. The whale was three-fourths of a mile offshore. No further sighting. -Scott Mercer, Mendonoma Whale and Seal Study
