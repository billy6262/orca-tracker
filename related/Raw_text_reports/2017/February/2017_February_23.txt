this evening. -Mark Malleson

After the
T18's and T124C
took out a steller sealion at the
north end of Satellite Channel a large group of T's showed up from the north and they all headed south west into Saanich Inlet. Total count was 23 individuals
. Thank you Gary Neuman for the keen eye and report from the
11:00 ferry out of Swartz Bay. He originally spotted a lot of splashing and blows between Portland Island and Moresby and then called with another sighting of
a couple more groups of killer whales south bound at the east entrance to Active Pass.

I sent a subsequent email following my first. I do wonder if they weren't the
Harbor Porpoise
. This would make sense judging by their size and pattern of swimming. Good Morning, What a glorious morning! I live on the west side of Camano Head, directly across from Langley's Marina. Most interesting to me, is the large pods of Porpoise coming through, north to south. Without exaggeration, I've witnessed
upwards of 60+ in a half hour time frame.
Over my 17 years of residing here, I've been privileged to watch them pass by many times, however, never so many at one time. -Mj Sawyer

...Had no idea that there were
Harbor porpoise
in this area. Because of the quantity, what we saw must have been porpoises. The fin did not appear as prominent as an adult orca per your pictures. Nor did they seem to "jump" out of the water as we have seen orcas do. I think you could safely put this sighting down to Harbor porpoises.
9:00 a.m. - near Bayside, Camano Island. A large group went by about
9am
, 23 Feb heading south. They were close to shore. We could see many black backs.
Over 24, maybe 30
. By far the largest group we have seen in the past two years. They were swimming in close formation heading direct south around the edge of the island. Amazing. -Debra Ketchell
