My wife and I saw
a whale today while walking along Owen's Beach at Point Defiance
. We followed it along the beach and watched it for about an hour. It was no more than 50'-100' off the beach most of the time. The dorsal fin was way too small for an Orca but it had a large dark colored body and tail, much larger than a dolphin. It looked a lot like a Minke but I can't say for sure. I tried to get some pictures but didn't catch it in time. It was swimming slowly, mostly in one direction then turned and stayed around the same area just north of the extreme end of Point Defiance. There seemed to be a few seals or sea lions following it so maybe feeding? (probably the juvenile humpback who has been living in this area). -Sierra Hartman
