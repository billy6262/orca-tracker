============================================================

Entry 1:
T060C north east bound in Race Passage
-Mark Malleson

This is
T113
, Bigg's killer whale (Transient), making what may be his first documented appearance in the Salish Sea. He was
travelling with several groups, including the T26s and T10s as they passed by Victoria
. There was no sign of T115. Interesting to note that since DFO's 2012 ID guide, he has acquired a small nick right on the top of his dorsal fin. -Valerie Shore
