Led by the indomitable James Mead Maya we ventured out
past Victoria to catch up with J Pod
, seeing
perhaps over 20 orcas
. In calm seas, they were foraging, traveling steadily west, at times spread out and at other times close together. We witnessed a few breaches, several spyhops, porpoising, tail slapping, cartwheeling, and generally enjoyed a spectacular day out on the Salish Sea with a lively crew of enthusiastic folks! A highlight for me was seeing a Steller Sea Lion dismantle a skate right next to the boat as hungry gulls swiped whatever they could from his chaotic feeding frenzy. -Steve Smith
