Orca Sightings for February 12, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
It's a
mom and baby grey whale
they were off Cliffside, close to shore off NAS Whidbey Island. all day and night. I got a few but they are not great they were not staying up long ... they were coming up at one point at the same time one was way bigger then the other a day they were just a distant off from each other. Had another whale watcher out here that said mom and baby. I would agree from all the years and tours etc. -Sonya Jennings
