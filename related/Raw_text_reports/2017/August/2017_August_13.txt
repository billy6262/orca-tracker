Orca Sightings for August 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Juan de Fuca - Another great adventure around
Sooke with multiple pods of Transient / Biggs Killer Whales
today! We encountered the first pod
5 minutes from our docks at Salty Towers
and were able to see them hunting very close to shore east bound all the way to Race Rocks and than had the pleasure with another Pod just South West of Race travelling west...Seen a Breaching Humpback from the distance and of course Sea Lions and our local Sea otter...What another great day! -Paul Pudwell

August 13 - Rosario Strait - Exhilarating sea conditions and a blustery breeze welcomed Mystic Sea's foray into
Rosario Strait
today where we encountered the
T65A transient orca family
, heading southbound and with purpose
for Colville Island, off Lopez
, a favored spot for Pacific harbor seals and maybe lunch! With a further report of another transient pod in the area, Mystic Sea navigated the narrow channel past Peapod Rocks, where half-a-dozen Bald Eagles kept vigil for an easy meal. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

going north in Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Teri Wise

Dorothy Layer on
West Beach Rd., Whidbey
, just south of the Naval Air Station and Joseph Whidbey State Park, witnessed
at least 3 orcas at 9AM
this morning, apparently slapping and biting an adult seal that apparently got away in the high surf or somehow arrived on her beach, quite dead but without any obvious major wounds. No photos or direction was given.
