Once again we were lucky to leave the dock on another bright, sunny morning in search of wildlife. Today we traversed more open water and slightly confused seas towards the Olympic Peninsula, where the
T30 transient orca family
were heading. With a young calf swimming in Mom's slipstream (the area of least resistance) we watched as the whales made
steady progress towards Dungeness Spit
. Our return journey was via Smith and Minor Island Aquatic Reserve, where we lucked out with sightings of a colorful Puffin (now listed as endangered in Washington State), and Golden and Bald Eagles keeping vigil for tasty morsels among the resting Pacific Harbor seals. Variety is, indeed, the spice of life. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist (Photos Richard Snowberger, Crew, using 300 mm + lens).

Entry 2:
4-6 transients inside Echo Bay around noon
today, we were pulling anchor when suddenly saw a bunch of whale boats
outside Sucia Island
. The whales came into Echo bay, circles along shore one of the finger shaped private islands and headed over to Matis Island. -Hans Loland

Entry 5:
8:47 p.m
Sara called back: Still watching whales and unsure of species - watching 10 whale spouts, then a few closer whales. Wondering if orca or humpback?

8:29 p.m. -
Received a message from Sara Blair who reported
a pod of orcas on the coast
. Location: They are
between Beach 4 and Kalaloch lodge
(can see Destruction Island to the right). Seeing
in the range of 7-10 whales
, spouts milling around in circle with obvious black dorsal fins. 1 male 1 female. Looks like hunting, looks like traveling together, then circling in circle. While leaving a message there was much excitement: "a large adult male right in front of us really close to shore." -Sarah Blair

Entry 6:
night time report of hearing multiple blows, sounding like several orcas
, off the
south end of Camano Island from
9:30 to 11 pm
