Bigg's/Transient killer whales - This is what we mean when we say the whales are "on the rocks" - which the
T34s, T36As, T37, and T37Bs were this afternoon at Reuben Tarte County Park on San Juan Island
! We had a great shore-based encounter with
more than 10 transients this afternoon
! Here from top to bottom is
T36A1, T37, and new little calf T34B
. These whales
made their way down San Juan Channel this afternoon, then came back up towards Spieden Island
this evening when we got to see them again by boat. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,
