After working our way through a spot of fog, Mystic Sea meandered between the San Juan islands and out through San Juan channel into the bigger swells of open water, where we encountered
one of our regular Minke whales, 'Nick Jagger', near Salmon Bank.
No need to ask why this Minke came by the name, although how Nick got 'the nick' is a mystery. Minkes are known to be rather shy and elusive, but today we were fortunate to see plenty of surface action including the streamlined, tapered head. While some of the growling Steller sea-lions posed and vied for the best position on Whale Rocks, others were content to doze in the hazy sunshine. Bald eagles and basking Pacific harbor seals with pups heightened our already rich wildlife viewing itinerary as we sailed past Lopez on our return to Anacortes. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

My wife and I were kayaking at

9:30 just north of Treasure Island
, Case Inlet this evening, heard and saw 2 that sounded just like this 40 feet away. One breached vertically completely out of the water. It was pretty dark out, but still spectacular. Our best guess is that it was the same as these. -Eric Johnson
