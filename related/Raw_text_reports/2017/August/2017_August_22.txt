Orca Sightings for August 22, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound -

5:12 pm -
another humpback report:
Single humpback midway between Scatchet Head on Whidbey and Apple Cove Point
on the Kitsap Peninsula. Kind of going in circles. One or two breaths, then a deep dive for several minutes. No drama, but nice flukes. No money shots - keeping our distance. Not bad for Day 1. -Marjiann Moss and Marty Loken
*
Five minutes off the dock passengers spotted
a humpback
which was doing wide circles
between Possesion, Point No Point and Edmonds
. She did some cartwheels, backwards tail lobs and then when we caught up to her on our way back, she did some lunge feeding in a bird pile! An unusual look at both her dorsal and rostrum while Humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" lunge feeds. -Janine Harles
*
Ok saw
a humpback
once more today off the shipwreck
south of Mukilteo this morning about 830 am
. Midchannel milling about. I suspect "Two Spot" again it cannot confirm this morning. -Toby Black
*
Eastern Juan de Fuca - Tues
August 22nd trip report - an incredibly beautiful day with mill-pond conditions, we set out towards Protection Island to find a
humpback
whale, but en route had several "glimpses" of
a minke whale
! On by Smith/Minor Islands we were rewarded by seeing some Tufted Puffins, then onward to locate the humpback between Protection Island and Point Wilson. We had some great views of this whale, but he didn't show his fluke (tail) so no confirmed ID. Homeward bound we saw several harbor porpoise, and many harbor seals. Beauty everywhere. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

Gray whales -
August 22 - Oregon Coast - On highway 101 Gayle Swigart and I were wending our way north along the Oregon Coast. One of our stops was
Hug Point, south of downtown Cannon Beach
. There but 3 minutes when we spot the unmistakable heart-shaped blows of a
gray whale just outside the the breaking waves
!

4:35-
5:25pm
we watched her/him cruising back and forth foraging just on the outer edges of the rolling surf. We spread the word and with complete enthusiasm each person (eventually growing into a crowd from babies to elders) stopped to take in this majestic whale moving about in the sparkly surf of the Pacific Ocean. Stunning & profound two-day Solar Eclipse Totality adventure which included time with this whale. In talking with a couple on the beach we learned the whale had been around since at least
3:30 as they had watched the whale for an hour before we arrived further south. As we spread the word, a nice group gathered to watch the whale. People from babies to elders, from many countries around the world, watched in awe. Smiles abound. Hug Point, Cannon Beach. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Minke whales -

Entry 2:
08:30 PM -
Saw
a minke whale out at the Mukilteo ferry dock
between Whidbey Island and Hat Island. There was one minke whale seen. The Minke whale just appeared to be traveling at a slow pace and did not to be traveling with any rush out to Hat Island. I did not get the best look at the whale but I did see the dorsal fin for a quick sec and it seemed that the dorsal fin was very small and looked like a Minke whale but I can't be certain. -Austin King

Unidentified whales -

Entry 3:
7:52PM reporting a whale in Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey island, heading south. The caller said it was a small whale with a dorsal fin.
Possibly a minke or a humpback
.

At

7:40pm
today, we saw
1 large whale spout and tail splash off of Beverly Beach, in Holmes Harbor
, Whidbey Island.
Gray or humpback whale
. -Jill Kennedy

Kathy Fritts relayed a report of
whales off Hidden Beach/North Bluff area of Greenbank on Whidbey Island at
6:18 pm
. They weren't sure of species, only reported seeing spouts, and that they were heading south in Saratoga Passage.
