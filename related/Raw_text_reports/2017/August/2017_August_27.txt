With no sign of the long, hot summer abating, Mystic Sea enjoyed pristine weather conditions from the moment we left the marina and headed
towards Port Angeles where we encountered the T60 transient orca family
hunting down a seal, the sound of their powerful exhalations carrying across the glassy calm waters. After a lot of tail-slapping and circling, the orcas still on scene rapidly changed gear to catch up with the other members of the pod, porpoising at speed in the shadow of the Olympic Peninsula.... -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

August 27 - Salmon Bank - ...As if this breathtaking experience of nature was not enough, we were fortunate to spot
a humpback whale near Salmon Bank
on our return, and hope that whatever injury this whale sustained along the dorsal ridge has not impacted it's ability to survive. -Report by Sandra Pollard, Photo by Richard Snowberger,
