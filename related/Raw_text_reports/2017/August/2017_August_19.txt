Entry 1:
T34 and new calf T34B off San Juan Island
on the evening of
August 19th. A simply beautiful night out on the water this evening
between Waldron and San Juan Islands
! We saw the T
36As, T37, and T46s in one group and then the T34s and T37Bs in another

T34's
in the most incredible light. Saturday evening

On
August 19, 2017 I was with another paddle boarder and a friend mine who was in a kayak. We were approximately 500 meters off my property on the
North East side of Gabriola Island
(we face the Sunshine Coast & we have a property on Queequeg Turnabout). Approximately 200 meters further out, we saw multiple dorsal fins rising out of the water - we new they were
Orcas
. I fell in the water off my paddle board - we're not sure if this is what precipitated the next set of events, but the whales progressively got closer to us. The other paddle boarder and I made our way back to my property. The kayaker made his way back at a more leisurely pace. However, it was clear that the whales were now following him & he made his way back to a section off the shore (about 20 meters) that was too shallow for the whales to get into to. The whales then proceeded to rise (not jump, just surface) multiple times approximately 50 feet away from the kayaker. This show went on for about 10 minutes. After this they proceeded south down the straight. We would be grateful for any insights into what this behaviour could signify (were we prey or were they simply curious). -Kurt Wipp

Bigg's/Transient killer whales -

1:12 p.m. - Spotted a very large pod of Orcas just outside of the entry point into Wescott Bay
on San Juan Island.
Probably 8-10 Orcas
, one with a huge fin. Lots of whale boats around now. They just took a dive. They seem to be traveling north. (
T46's, 37B's and maybe others. per James Gresham
). -Jess Whitsitt

Between 5 and
5:30 today I spotted a humpback traveling from Edmonds Sunset Bay north passing Picnic Point
& heading up the channel with Whidbey on the west side. Spotted him or her 3 separate times heading that path. -Lorraine Wilmoth
(
Presumably Admiralty BCY Uknown - ALB
)
*
At about

1:25 p.m. - we saw a breach further south, off so. Mutiny Bay or Double Bluff
. It was quite a distance from where we'd last seen the humpback we'd been watching breach, so not sure if it was the same whale or a 2nd.

1:10 p.m. - humpback nearing Point no Point near Hansville
, still breaching, pec slapping and cartwheeling or tail lobbing with its entire body! -Susan Berta, Orca Network
*

12:52 p.m. - Lots of activity in front of Mutiny Bay, possible humpback whale
. Feeding. -Caron Mccune

Dave and Karen Anderson called at

12:35
, they
think there are several humpbacks, breaching and pec slapping, seen between Windmill heights and Mats Mats Bay
.
*
Jan Bell called at

12:30, saying humpback is still traveling south from Bush pt
and still breaching!
*

12:27p.m. - Humpback BCY Unknown between Bush Pt. and Hansville
. BCY Unknown had a great time heading down Admiralty today. It was slap, slap, slap, breach, breach, fluke, rinse and repeat all the way from at least Bush Point to Point No Point. Pectoral flippers were flying. -Photo by Howard Garrett, Orca Network,

Entry 5:
*
We spotted what appeared to be a
humpback whale from the beach in Mutiny Bay
. It was traveling south. First spotted it closer to
Bush Point and lost sight of it near Double Bluff
. It was far from shore but we witnessed several breaches and huge splashes. Using binoculars, we could see it slapping the water with giant pectoral fins which is why I'm pretty sure it was a humpback. There were several boats very near it and I'm sure those guys got an amazing show. It was too far for us to photograph. It was within our sight for 30 minutes +. Very cool! I'd be interested to hear if you've had other reports. Feeding and playing. Several breaches (whole body except tail) and slapping the water with large pectoral fins. We first saw it a little before noon and lost sight of it around 1230 if I recall correctly. -Lindsey Goheen

12:21 p.m. - Humpback just passed Bush Point

Entry 7:
whale at Point No Point
on the 19th at Point No Point in the late afternoon
5 ish pm
. From other postings I think it could be
Humpback whale
, CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" but I am not sure. Attached 3 pictures. Anyone knows, where are the Two Spots that give her her name ?It was a joy to watch even if briefly as she disappeared after a couple of breathings on the surface. I am from Spain (physical oceanographer from the UW) and this is the first time I am able to report a sighting. Very cool!...All the best and keep it up ! Thank you for a job well done. -Alan Cantos

Admiralty Inlet - (Included below are 2 more photos of this
BCY Uknown
from
August 19th who was included in our last report (with ID fluke image). As noted above, this whale is a match to the humpback of
August 23rd off the north side of Hat Island. And as noted in our previous report s/he is the same whale who was in Rosario Strait south of Pea Pod Rocks on
July 10th and in Possession Sound near the Clinton ferry dock on
July 22nd - ALB)

BCYUnk left pectoral flipper (underside) Bush Point

Entry 8:
grey whales
feeding close to shore. There was a smelt run, apparently. We are
99% sure we saw a humpback mixed in
, off and on. We watched them for about 3 hours close to
Kalaloch
. Leslie Cummings

Juan de Fuca - ...yesterday, (Aug 19) I planted myself at around the same time as the previous viewing and saw whale activity around a little point at the
east end of Bullman Beach. (Sekiu)
I immediately grabbed my camera and headed to the beach. Within minutes there were whales, two this time; an adult and a young one. Seemed there were "lessons" being taught, about stirring up the bottom with their fins. I followed them down the beach for over 100 yards, shooting as I went. They seemed then to hit a place along the bottom that was not to their liking and they headed out into deeper water. -Scott Hartman
