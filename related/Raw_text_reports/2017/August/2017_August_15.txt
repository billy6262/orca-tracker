We are really amazed at the hunting style of the
Transient Killer Whales (T60s)
They really know how to "hug" the shore line and push through Kelp beds to find their prey! We were fortunate enough to witness at least one quick chomp of a harbour seal that was shared by all the pod...Lost them in the fog south west bound from Beachy Head. -Photo by Paul Pudwell,

At least 3 orcas spotted on a BC ferry leaving Mayne Island today at
5:45pm!
They we're pretty close to Mayne, the ferry had only been moving for a few minutes. They must have been heading in the opposite direction of us and back towards Mayne because after they went under and disappeared the whale watch boat that was watching them continued on in the direction we had just come from. I think it was a whale watch boat from Orcas Island? Very exciting to see! -Erin Campbell

Haro Strait - The mamas T99 and T65A.
T65As & T99s passed SJ County Park NB at 9am
today. They covered some serious ground the last two days. T65A4 has something in his/her mouth. T65A2 (I call him "Chaser" because he's still fine tuning his hunting skills) showing off the chip in his tail flukes. -Photo by Ariel Yseth,

about
4:30 from Moat Creek Bluff. Confirmed two.
Large and very fast moving parallel to shore with all black dorsal fins showing at times. A few minutes before the sighting there were a few individual sea lions moving quickly in same direction. You know how it goes. A few quick seconds of pure magic." (moat Creek is at
Pt Arena in Mendocino County
