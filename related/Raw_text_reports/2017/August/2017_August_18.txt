Entry 2:
Gray whale live strands off Washington Coast
. Late Friday night
a dramatic rescue
effort by members of NOAA Fisheries' West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network freed a young gray whale that had been stranded on a remote beach at Olympic National Park (pictured here Friday morning) for about three days. Successful rescues of stranded large whales are rare, and we're grateful to the many marine mammal experts, National Park Service staff, volunteers and others who dropped everything and hurried to the scene in hopes of saving this whale. A pulley system rigged up in the nick of time helped the team to maneuver the whale into the surf at high tide at
10:19 p.m. and then, suddenly, the whale was gone! "The mission at one point seemed like it was failing with little progress made and the whale not seeming to be able to help and even appearing to turn back toward shore," said John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research Collective. "Then, at the last possible moment, with the whale in about four feet of water in the surf and the harness released, the whale started to swim." "A cheer went up in the darkness and the assembled team stood shining lights into the darkness and mist, stunned at the apparent turn of events and success," Calambokidis recalled. -NOAA Fisheries West Coast - Science & Management
