8:30 -
9:25 p.m. - I moved to Haines Wharf, north Edmonds
and spotted both whales close together first just about 1/4 mile offshore. They continued to circle around anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 mile offshore milling, foraging around together in the waning light. Regular surface patterns with directional changes, sounding showing flukes each time. Gorgeous afternoon into evening. That's where I leave them.

7:00-
8:15 p.m. -
Both whales were staying around west side of Possession Bar, and now both have made their way east. One last seen SE of Possession Point, the other is currently 1/4 mile off shore from probably around Haines Wharf, north Edmonds diving in super calm seas.

6:52 p.m. -
whale 2 moved on NE. S/he is just out here milling in wide area, quite lazily. Little fishes jumping everywhere!

6:45 p.m. -
different whale surfacing further west south of Cultus Bay. Maybe first whale I was watching. #2 (closer to Edmonds whale) is sightline towards Possession Point but well southeast of more on Edmonds side of channel just logging/resting.

6:13 p.m. -
nice series of surfacing then subtle dive, showing fluke. Directionally westbound. (close in whale)

6:00 p.m. -
2nd whale much closer to Edmonds. North end maybe 1/2-1 mile offshore, currently southbound.

5:45 p.m. - humpback
just woke up and went on slow dive in NW bound direction.

5:40 p.m. -
I'm seriously observing a sleeping giant. This
humpback is just drifting north
in flat calm seas, taking a breath every so often. Harbor porpoise all around, osprey above...feels like a little fairy tale. So sweet. Hope he's full of some energy when he awakes.

5:20 p.m. -
finally spotted who might be Orion. From
north Edmonds sight line Point No Point
closer to Edmonds maybe 2 miles offshore. Just logging, sleepy looking whale. Seas glassy calm, blue sky, warm temps. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

5:09 p.m. - Humpback whale spotted from the Edmonds/Kingston ferry
(
4:40 run), north of ferry lanes, mid-channel. Slow moving, rolling behavior, lots of pectoral slaps. -Martha Carlstead
*

4:12 p.m. - Humpback BCX1251 Orion just northwest of Edmonds
now swimming around in circles, but at the surface a lot. Another humpback just west of Richmond Beach/Edmonds (long down times on this one) From Chilkat Express. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist

Entry 3:
Central Puget Sound -
2:45 p.m. -
While hoping to get a glance of this whale, we went to
Olalla
. On Vashon side, I saw a dorsal fin twice, heading
North in Colvos
. It disappeared after that. My assumption was of a humpback. -Danielle Clark

Report from WA State Ferries from

9:05 this morning of a humpback in the vicinity of Blakely Rock
(SE Bainbridge Island), heading south in the south-bound traffic lane.

Surprise of the day a reported humpack that turned out to be
a gray whale! San Juan Channel moving south through Cattle Pass
and then out in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. -Report & photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,
