Day report: On
June 30th we got to see
many different transient orcas
. We met them near
Salmon Bank at around 11am
. The first whales we saw were the
T37As and T36Bs who were joined by T51
. They passed very closely to Whale Rocks alerting the one steller sea lion on the rock.
Another group of orcas
in the distance were the first to enter
Cattle Pass
against the ebb which included the
T99s
and maybe some others. All orcas travelled into
Upright Channel
. We witnessed a predation event near the
entrance to East Sound on Orcas Island with the 37As and 36Bs
. The others were on the other side of East Sound about 2 miles distant near Peavine Pass. Shortly after they joined together and headed along the
west side of Blakely Island and through Thatcher Pass about
6:30pm
. Earlier in the day the
T49As were reported near Beaumont Shoal
. They
also came through Cattle Pass and we caught up with them at 8pm near Turn Island
. Many long dives - they zig zagged their way right into Friday Harbor. They appeared to be milling/maybe hunting in the middle of the harbor. They took the pass behind Brown Island and into Shipyard Cove where they were milling for quite awhile in the far back of the cove. T37A with youngest calf who has an interesting dorsal fin. -Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

3:55 p.m. -
Marie of WS Ferries relayed a report from the ferry Elwha of
at least five orcas in Upright Channel
, between Lopez and Shaw islands, heading NW, and that the captain is hearing there are three groups along the channel.
*
Saw these beauties at the
south end of Lopez island today. I believe T37As and T51
. This was about

1:30
in the afternoon. They were definitely hunting. They were circling and going from small island to island looking for seals. They started off in the channel between San Juan island and Lopez island then heading east along the south end of Lopez island. They reached the end of Lopez island and turned around to retrace their route. -Danielle Pennington
*
SO MANY transients in the area, was hard to keep track of who was where. We found the
T37As and T36
in the morning out at
Hein Bank
, heading E/NE, while the
49As were over by Victoria. T51 was also out in the Strait
at this time, as we could see him to the north. Then we heard reports of the 99's, 36As and Bs too
!! The 37As were traveling with T36
at a moderate pace in a tight group when we found them, but later split up as they started to hunt. Most are zoomed and cropped but we did have several close surfacings.
T37A3, T37A, T36 and T37A2. Matriarch, 37A and 37A4, sustained an injury to the dorsal at some point last year.

Just sighted inside
Strait of Georgia off Galiano Island heading south. (in Trincomali Channel, SW side of Galiano) We saw at least 3.
They went in opposite direction so they were farther away... Orcas were fast though heading south. -Petra Schindler-Carter

Approx
430pm: Humpback NW, off Dash Point mid water between there and Vashon Island

- Larry Liedtke came into the Whale Museum and mentioned (and filmed)
15-20 Dall's porpoises
