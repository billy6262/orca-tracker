Today is World Oceans Day! We celebrated by spending time with the Apex predator of all oceans, the Killer Whale! The
T65As slowly traveled down the west side of San Juan Island
today. -Photo by Traci Walter, Western Prince,

Entry 2:
*
A wet but lovely day with the
T65A Bigg's orcas off Lime Kiln to Hannah Heights
. Very slowly moving south, against the tide, perhaps even napping. Some Dall's porpoises were close by, but no reaction from either the whales or the porpoises. Caught a brief glimpse of a humpback off Hannah Heights, but far away. Two very wet and bedraggled eagles topped off another lovely day. -Bonnie Gretz

Dall's/Harbor porpoise hybrid...just south of Lime Kiln
