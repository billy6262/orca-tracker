Well, it sure has been
humpback heaven
lately. Sorry but I've got more breaching humpbacks for you, only this time from the Strait of Juan de Fuca including one of our favorite whales. On
June 24, Chilkat Express was on scene with
a lone humpback just north of Dungeness Spit
when we looked off to the west and saw multiple breaches from other humpback whales about 3 miles away. We didn't waste any time cruising over to take a look, and the breaching continued as we got closer. When we arrived I realized that we had
BCX1068, Split Fluke, traveling with a new calf!!
The calf was breaching over and over again, and mom was breaching about once for every breach from her calf. Intermixed with the breaches they would slap their pectoral fins on the surface over and over again, until one, or both of them would arch their backs, raise their tail flukes and dive down deeper only to come flying out of the water within a few seconds! Incredibly exciting!! We must have seen at least 50 breaches, if not more, from the time we first spotted them. All the breach photos I attached are from the calf, but I do have one photo with the pectoral fins in the air from both animals! It was hard to choose what photos to send because there were so many of them!! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist Chilkat Express

6:50 p.m. - Humpback with calf passed by Lime Kiln heading north

Entry 6:
dmiralty Inlet/Mutiny Bay -
8:11 p.m. - Whale sighting ("humpback?) 5-10 minutes ago on southern end of Mutiny Bay.
Looked like it was feeding because it was swimming in circles w/blows -not sure what direction it went. -Jana De Long Raasch

headed towards Double Bluff. Exciting! -Jeanne Schindler

Entry 7:
Central Puget Sound - Humpback in central Puget Sound.
Evening of Sat 24th June. Approx

6:50PM to
7:20PM
we watched
a single Humpback
a few hundred yards North of VTS Yellow buoy "SG" (
Between West Point and Skiff Point on Bainbridge
.) Many fluke slams, lots of fluke waving. Numerous vocalizations. Some dives, but whale was at surface about 50% of the time. We were sailing on a course that took us as close as about 1/4 mile. We slowed the boat and when a bit upwind hove to about 400 yds away. Distance decreased to perhaps 300 yds over 15 mins. Whale then moved closer to Skiff Point and estimated 1/2 mile from us. Sailing charter so I was busy occupied with boat handling, guest safety, etc. Got no photos except distant water disturbances. -Andy Huntley

2:00 p.m. - Small humpback
less than
1 mile off Fay Bainbridge
, slowly heading south. -Brenna Sowder

ferry between Wing Point and West Point. Appeared to be headed north. -James Rufo-Hill
