Early reports of Orca off Sooke from a local fisherman had me on the water before our morning tour and was excited to be one of the first to welcome
"L" pod back to the Salish sea
. Seems they were foraging close to shore in the kelp beds in search of Salmon. Hopefully the Endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales will find plenty of food to keep them around for a while. We sped off to catch
L Pod still fighting a strong ebb and foraging at Race Rocks

Today we had several different groups of Killer whales in the area.
L pod was heading in from the Pacific, The T2C's were off the west side of San Juan Island this morning, and there was another group of Bigg's Killer whales in Rosario Strait
. The T2C's! A very special family group for a number of reasons. Firstly, T2C is the daughter of T2, a female that had been captured in Pedder Bay near Victoria, BC back in the 70's and on her way to be shipped to another marine park when she and another whale were released. It's only because of her release that this group exists. T2 is no longer with us, but this is her daughter and grandchildren. In addition, one of T2C's kids T2C2 "Tumbo" has scoliosis of the spine. He's not able to hunt for himself and his family does the hunting and will share with him. Killer whales are such dedicated family members and this tenderness between family members is quite amazing to see. This family typically hangs out in the Campbell River area, but they have been around in the San Juans the last week. Wonder how long they will stick around! Sure is plenty of food for them. Here's a LINK with more information about this incredible family and the history of T2. -Traci Walter, Western Prince

Eastern Juan de Fuca -
Tonight's
Transient Killer Whale
encounter was among the best I've ever had! Dozens of orcas were playing, hunting, and feeding together.
T123A
Stanley was kind of the star of the show as he was in most of the photos I took, but
in addition to the T123s, we also saw the T124s, T101s
and so many more it was hard to keep track! All photos here were taken on 6/12/17 near
Minor Island

5:05 p.m. - Large group of 25 Bigg's/Transients in eastern Juan de Fuca near Smith and Minor Islands
on multiple kills, lots of breaches. Circles....literally they were on the East side of Smith and Minor, lots of kills, travelling in circles. -Janine Harles

North Puget Sound - About
4:30
Marilyn saw a blow as we were coming down the hill towards Haines Wharf. About

4:40 from Haines Wharf park we saw the humpback
surface
about a mile west of north Edmonds
in northerly direction, did not see him surface again, he may have flipped back and surfaced behind some trees in our way. I moved a little bit south and and scouted until about

5:30
but never saw him again. Conditions were beautiful calm, but I was somewhat distracted some by other events. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network & Marilyn Armbruster

3:02 pm - Orion the humpback (BCX 1251) is off of Edmond
s, North of Sunset Avenue, between Edmonds and Possession but closer to Edmonds. -Janine Harles

South Puget Sound -
9:42 a.m.
- Doubled back and appears to be really close to Browns Point now. Down times were about 4 min.

9:26 a.m. -
Closer to the Browns Point side still headed east
towards the Port of Tacoma

7:20 a.m. - There was a single Humpback whale off the Point Defiance
ferry lane going west to east. Closer to the Point Defiance side this morning at about

Entry 2:
Discovery Islands in BC
, Canada every year. Besides black bears, brown bears, and thousands of eagles we usually photograph Pacific white-sided dolphins, and humpback whales too. This year we had an amazing experience with
two humpback whales just north of Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park
, at the very north end of Georgia Strait. We had
BCXuk2012#3 (Spotlight), and BCX0565 (Nick)
on this particular encounter on
June 12. At first they appeared to be resting together, with lots of surface time and swimming slowly, but no deep dives. Then, out of nowhere they raised their tail flukes for deep dives and they started breaching over and over again! They followed that up with hundreds of pectoral fin slaps mixed in with some breaches here and there! The action, went on for at least an hour before they slowed down and things went back to normal again. It was one of the most amazing humpback whale experiences I've ever had!! -Bart Rulon
