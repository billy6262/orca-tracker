Orca Sightings for June 16, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
L-Pod!
It was difficult viewing conditions on the
west side of San Juan Island
this evening, but since it's been more than 7 months since these whales have been here, we'll take what we can get! After coming part way in the strait a few days ago, L-Pod made it all the way to San Juan Island this evening,
hitting the shoreline and going south around
7:30 PM
. This shot is of L91 Muncher. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute,

WOW! Another great day on the water with our Local
Southern Resident Killer Whales of L Pod
minutes from our docks today! We found them coming in from the west just past Otter Point. We had a wonderful visit with them feeding on salmon past Sooke and onward to Race Rocks where we seen Sea Lions and Elephant Seals. Finally our local Eagles feeding on some water foul at our docks. -Paul Pudwell

Entry 4:
:00 p.m. - The humpback
was reported by Keller Galvin heading north out of
Eld Inlet
after two breaches.
*

12:40 p.m. - Humpback
has now headed north out of
Eld Inlet
, very close to shore, doing very shallow surfacing series. 3 surfaces and then a long dive. It is heading north toward Hunter Point.

11:30 a.m. - Robust humpback heading south in Eld Inlet
. Slow rolling surface right off shore (at my house and me inside without a camera) and it continued south, closer to shore. Heard it 2 more times behind the blocking trees and then saw it surface the fourth time further into Eld. No fluke. -Kim Merriman

Entry 5:
2 Gray Whales at Possession Point
reported to the Langley Whale Center today at 12 pm. -Jim Lovvorn
(
Reported to docents at LWC as grays but
quite possibly humpbacks
since they's been documented regularly in that area. North Sound grays left weeks ago but is possible two stray gray found one another -ALB
)

Hi, just thought I'd report these grey whale I saw in
Dana Passage (Olympia)
on 6/16/17. We saw a single whale several times for a few minutes around
2pm
. (This was a
confirmed humpback
as reported in our
June 20th Whale Sighting report -ALB) -Amber Settle
