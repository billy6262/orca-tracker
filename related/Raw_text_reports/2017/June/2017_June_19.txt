Admiralty Inlet - Glorious sunset with
single Humpback heading south past Bush Point at
9:15pm
, mid-channel of buoy's east side. We kept watching until
9:35pm. Last saw it just south of Bush Point, then did not see it again. Unfortunately, can't say of it continued southward, or not...? -Anna & Pip

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound -
11:40 a.m. - Johnson Pt.
Heard the blow then looked and saw a
humpback
. My husband thought he saw two, one being smaller. They dove under and haven't resurfaced within our view. Wish I could give a direction of travel but I don't have enough information. -Joan Ahre

Gray (or unconfirmed) whales - (
categorizing as gray since
reported as gray and further details provided sounds plausible
based on description. Leaving open possibility it is one of the humpbacks who has been confirmed feeding int he bay - ALB
) At approximately
930PM,
Monday,
June 19, my wife and I sighted
a Gray Whale
that surfaced about 100 yards offshore in front of 6358 Barr Beach Rd
in the middle of Mutiny Bay
. Our attention was drawn to the whale by the sound of his blow hole breath upon surfacing. He seemed to alone and continued north up the bay, surfacing to breath every 2 or 4 minutes, audible for us for the next 20-30 mins. Not sure, but possibly feeding on herring. We seen lots of schools/herring balls in recent days. ...I'm no expert, so yes, it's possible it was a Humpback. It was dusk and the whale was about 100 yards from shore, but directly in front of me. I saw a dark gray and mottled white back rolling forward, accompanied by a two-way blow hole breath. The breath was fairly prolonged and almost melodic. No fin was exposed. If the other sighting was definitively a Humpback, then I would guess I saw the same whale. As I stayed outside and it darkened, I heard the whale return in the opposite direction it came (now heading S by SW), blowing at the same rate as before, but now more like 500-600 yards out. I had no visual of the whale, but could hear it clearly. -Mark Van Hollebeke
