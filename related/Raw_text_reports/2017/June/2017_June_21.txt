. -Renee Beitzel

12:10 am -
They appear to be feeding off of
south western tip of Allan island
.

11:55 am - Orcas traveling north between Biz Point and Allan Island
. Too far away to ID count. Several whale watching boats viewing at reasonable distance. -Ann Hazen
*

11:30 a.m. - the Transients made it under the bridge
against the currents and headed west. -Reported by Sammy Kempbell from Rosario Beach.
*

11:00 a.m. - 5-6 Transients/Bigg's whales are fighting strong currents under the Deception Pass bridge
to head west out of Saratoga Passage. They are currently still east of the bridge and have made several tries and been washed back. Reported by Stephanie Raymond aboard the Victoria Clipper.

Entry 3:
8:00 a.m. - Orca Pod (5-7) off NAS Whidbey Island
. My office had the delight of seeing Orcas this morning. They appeared to be feeding. They were in the same general area for about 15 minutes. Looked like they were headed mostly west until we couldn't see them anymore. -Sandy Mattingly
*
Humpback off Mutiny Bay
. Sandra Pollard reports seeing a
humpback off Mutiny Sands boat launch at
11:12AM,
about 200 yards out, heading south. Surprise, surprise...Could hardly believe my eyes this morning walking along the beach at Mutiny Bay when a humpback surfaced alongside no more than 200 yards from shore. -Report & photo by Sandra Pollard
*

8:00 a.m. -
a report from WS Ferries of
"3 gray whales one mile north of Mukilteo ferry lane, heading north."
No further details. (
It seems unlikely that there would be 3 grays in Possession Sound right now, and they were a mile away, so possibly they saw blows of orcas or humpbacks? - HG
