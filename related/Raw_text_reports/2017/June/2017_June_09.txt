Orca Sightings for June 9, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
My wife and I took a charter today on the "Red Head" based with Puget Sound Express out of Port Townsend, WA and sighted
a transient group
. We were located
between D'Arcy and Sidney Islands west of San Juan
. Attached photo (including just one in report - ALB) of a male with another killer whale. We came upon
T49C
later on traveling solo-Mike McCarty

T170
(right) plus another and the Center for Whale Research. T170 is a very rarely seen whale. He was here in 2014 but to our knowledge only seen once. -Photo by Mike McCarty,

Boundary Pass -
Sunset moonrise sail. The only whales we knew of were way to the North. However we knew that they could get going and head South so we planned accordingly sailing
Presidents Channel
in the evening light. An eagle caught a fish right in front of us and swam breast-stoke to shore with wings. Waking from the siesta were the harbor seals of the crystal coves of the jeweled islands. Arrived at East Point to a furious flurry of very close whales before they split into a wide sweep across Boundary Pass in the still waters of sunset. And the moon rose full to their distant blows. (Mix of
T124As and T65As - the T2Cs split off at East Point
). -Barbara & David, All Aboard Sailing

Active Pass - ...a larger group of orcas was visible off Edith Point on Mayne island on Friday at 130pm
, followed by 7 whale-watching boats. They were splashing and very active, probably fishing. Trending South toward Saturna, but quite a distance from shore. -Yves Tiberghien, Mayne Island, BC, Canada
*
Haro Strait -
Today we found ourselves up in Haro Strait after a report of "many orcas" inbound in the morning. When we arrived they were really spread out with a few individuals traveling alone and others in small groups. We learned that one of them was a really rare transient,
T170
, ID'd by Center for Whale Research and that he had only been seen once in Haro before but that it had been quite some time. Cool! Then, I was able to ID one of our "regulars",
T49C
, as he was by himself, trailing behind the rest. Only after going through photos though, did I discover the "others" were the T36As and a few too far to ID. -Renee Beitzel

This morning some
transient killer whales
Monika has never seen before passed the
west side of San Juan Island
. From her photos we identified at least
T170, T172, T117A, and T117B
, rare visitors to this area, traveling with the
T36As and T49C
, who are regularly seen. Not only is it awesome to meet "new" whales, it's humbling to be reminded just how little we know about these populations of whales that are our neighbors. By documenting what goes on here, we hope to gain at least a little more insight into their lives! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute

South Puget Sound -

9:00 -p.m.
- Just surfaced in the Tallequah ferry lane again.

8:16 p.m. -
Just saw it spout. Headed back
towards Point Defiance/Owens Beach
, Vason side.

8:07 p.m. -
I think they went
up Colvos
, that big boat looks to be headed back to Ruston that was pursuing them. And it's been a while since I saw the blows, but they were going under for 10 plus min at a time and changing direction.

7:35 p.m. - Blows in front of Point Defiance going towards Owens Beach
.

7:28 p.m. - Just saw 2 huge blows off the point of Point Defiance
rounding towards The Narrows but still visible from Point Dalco.

6:55 p.m. -
Both under for several minutes could go either direction, Colvos or towards Maury. Neighbor says he has seen them hanging out all day here though.

6:45 p.m. - 2 for sure
. Lots of time between surfacing, right in front of our house now, smaller one keeps surfacing westbound now, large one has been under for a while.

6:40 p.m. - Just saw one humpback, maybe 2
(because there was so much body), surface and spout twice at point Dalco. Appeared to be
headed northeast towards pt. Defiance
. -Sarah Bradford Honeywell
*

8:35 a.m. - Humpback between Vashon Island and Point Defiance
, headed north towards Sunrise Beach. Biiig blows! Saw him for only about 5 minutes, but he was moving very quickly north into the Colvos. (Sunrise Beach is in Gig Harbor). -Gaby Kinner
*
North Puget Sound -
8:40 p.m. - Two humpbacks off of Presidents Point in Kingston
, about mid channel milling around...One is smaller than the other. I have been keeping my eye out all day for any of them. -Carrie Beamer Urquhart
*

8:40 p.m. -
We see some right now,
off Pt. Jefferson, Kingston
, milling around. Not quite halfway across the channel. Looks to be
the big and smaller one again
. We see the dorsals and the flukes when they go down. -Chris Beamer Otterson
*

3:50 p.m. - Sighted a smaller baleen whale just North of the Kingston Ferry.
Sharply pointed dorsal, low blow, followed alongside the Schooner Adventuress for about 10 minutes. Believe it was a minke (
is
humpback
, see photo below - ALB
) based on size, dorsal shape, and behavior. She was headed South. Blew four or five times and fluked, tried to get a picture for ID but we were broad onto her. -Gabby Edenshaw
*

5:44 a.m. - On the Kingston Edmonds ferry
and we just spotted
a lone whale
heading towards the Kingston marina. I googled the difference between a humpback and a gray, and it definitely looked like a
humpback
. Small dorsal fin, lighter gray color. It was kind of small in the terms of a whale. Swimming pretty fast towards the marina. After the captain announced it, we saw the back breach about 3 times.) -Danny N Karah
*
Gray whales -
5:08 a.m. -
Melinda Barajas passed on a report from her dad Rick Harris: "Got small grey whale breaching twice just north of ferry lane about 400-500 yard from shore moving
south Kingston side
. He felt sure it's a gray.
