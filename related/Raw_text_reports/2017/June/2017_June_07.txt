Orca Sightings for June 7, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
T2Cs
are an incredible family group of
transient killer whales
that we were lucky enough to encounter this evening. Not only are they descendants of some of the first and most well known transients like T1 Charlie Chin and the white whale Chimo, but one of their ranks is this whale,
T2C2 Tumbo, a 12 year-old male who has scoliosis
, resulting in a heavily deformed spine. As the rest of his family traveled together, he was trailing about a mile behind. But then they stopped and appeared to pin a harbor seal on the bottom. Once they killed it, he came in to join them in the feasting. It is through their altruism that he has made it this long. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

The
T124As and T101s were traveling together
and it was a lovely evening to visit them. Here's
T102, T124A3, T101, and T124A1 in Swanson Channel
. Seeing them all grouped up together is another poignant reminder of how important it is to protect them and the ecosystem they rely on.

Entry 3:

Orcas off Lime Kiln at 3pm
today. Out pretty far in the strait but they made for a good show. -Julia Wallace
*
Coastal killer whales -
We received a call from Jesse Logan, relaying a report of
3 - 6 orcas off Heceta Head, OR
observed sometime
between 5 - 6 pm
. He saw lots of splashing and lots of birds, looked like they made a kill off Heceta Head, then they headed north very fast, about 100 meters from shore. He followed them up to Rock Creek but then lost them. He took some distant photos and video which he will send us tonight, and we'll forward on if there is anything identifiable or useful in them.

Spieden Channel - Humpback, maybe 2
, heading East thru Spieden Channel. Last seen between Flattop and Limestone Point area. Dark and light rain over here. -Peggy Mauro
*
North Puget Sound - Around
830pm - BCX1251 Orion off the Point No Point Lighthouse
. They were further near the Whidbey Island but swim close to the lighthouse. After that they made a turn around and head out. This photo (below) was taken when they head out. I'm sure there was a smaller one too, the calf posssibly. You welcome, I was excited see how close they were swimming to the light house and was able to be there at the right time. Something I did not expected, made my day! -Vang KouKoukachu
*

7:43 p.m. - Humpback off Hansville for the past 2-3 hrs.
Did a full breach, but I didn't catch it on camera. We saw it from shore. -Photo by Maryann Stigen,

Entry 4:
*
Dalco Pass -
7:55 p.m.
- Another one or the same one on the
Commencement Bay side of the Point Defiance ferry lane
right now headed toward Ruston near the Copperline apts. A boat just floated over there and the whale dove under but we watched it for maybe 5 or 10 minutes.
My mom and I saw a very clear (
gray or humpback?
) spout twice today,
west side of the Point Defiance ferry around

5:45-
5:50 this evening
. We didn't get a great look but it was big enough to be a whale. I didn't notice a dorsal, and the only color I saw was darker, similar to a seal...but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Nothing more to add except that the spray from the blowhole was high and significant. Definitely very dark color -Kelli Michelle

An update for anyone interested - the
whale
was still active and visible near the
entrance to Quartermaster Harbor
. We saw it from the

7:00pm
sailing. More west side. It surfaced right next to the dock at one point. -Vanessa VanGilder
*

11:50 a.m. -
Desiree Sauve spotted and photographed
a humpback heading northbound off eastern entrance of Quartermaster Harbor
off the south end of Maury/Vashon Island (Piner Point). Going north and fast, only saw her/him once.
*
Central Puget Sound -
7:00 a.m. -
It's back north near the lighthouse. Lots of breaching and tail lobbing.

6:08 a.m. -
It's heading south now along Beach Dr SW

5:52 a.m. - The humpback
is here again this morning. Just around the bend from the lighthouse on Beach Drive. (
Alki, West Seattle
). -Tori Mauro
*
North Puget Sound - Single gray whale
(most likely) headed north and moving fast off
Point No Point at 5 PM
. -Jim Larkin
*

12:05 p.m. - Gray whale
reported by WSF heading south
off Kingston ferry dock
.
*
Commencement Bay -
7:00 p.m. - Gray Whale sighted in Tacoma
. Just sat down at the Lobster Shop on Ruston Way approximately 7 p.m. on
June 6th when I saw a Gray Whale surface one time for several seconds approximately
80 yards away from my outdoor table
. Due to lighting conditions, did not get a good look at the entire whale, just saw about 20-25 feet of it. It was
heading into Commencement Bay
. Could not determine this (behaviors), on surface for only a few seconds. -Edd Burkhardt

transient killer whale population, T2C4

Entry 5:
*
Tiffany Diamond shared on our Facebook page a beautiful 4 plus minute VIDEO she filmed while aboard the

11:55 WS Ferry sailing from Kingston to Edmonds of humpback pec slapping
, breaching, milling in glassy calm waters.
*
Common dolphins -

Entry 6:
1:00 p.m.
- still out there, kind of between me and
Fay Bainbridge
park now, still trending north. There are quite a few of them actually, strung out between Magnolia and Fay Bainbridge, look to be east of mid channel. Coming up and then staying down for quite a bit. Foraging?

12:23 p.m. -
These may be the ones I'm seeing straight out from the ship canal, headed northbound, east of mid-channel. (These were definitely
dolphins
) They had rather long dorsal fins though. I would have almost thought they were orca except for the frequency of appearance and the lack of the breathing pause and discernible blow. (Looking through binoculars). -Sandra Prow
*

11:09 a.m. - Pod of Dolphins are still out in Elliott Bay north of Alki.
Rather spread out, but still hanging out. -Troy Hightower
*

10:50 a.m. -
probably those same
dolphins
are now north of the ferry lane, I can only see them with binoculars from my "perch"
above Pier 55
. They aren't moving fast and are quite spread out, but do seem to be trending north. Hard to count but I've seen maybe 6 pop up at any given time. (Definitely not the humpback, that's what I've been trying to catch sight of.) -Donita Gier
*

10:48 a.m. -
Just saw one single (I believe it's a
dolphin
) headed steadily south at a good clip, viewing from
Me-Kwa-Mooks
park. Already probably
close to the WS/Vashon ferry lane
. Also just saw a second one pass the same spot I'm at, so if there is a pod they are spread kinda far apart. Definitely too small for a humpback and no spout seen. I'm almost certain they are the dolphins someone was seeing earlier. -Brian-Nicole Jenkins
*

9:55 a.m. - likely Common dolphins in Elliott Bay.
South of Bainbridge ferry lanes heading east or northeast. Viewing from Alki, straight out line of sight from Marine Ave SW. Travelling quickly and a single breach. Haven't seen in 8 minutes since, and have no idea how many. Pretty far out since I don't have binoculars. -Jason Lee Bell
