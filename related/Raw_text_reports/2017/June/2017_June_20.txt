Orca Sightings for June 20, 2017

Entry 1:
Strait of Georgia - A little patience pays off sometimes when watching whales. We were with
2 Humpback whales in the Strait of Georgia
this morning. They were cruising along zigging and zagging and occasionally showing their flukes. On the last surfacing we stayed to watch these two, suddenly out of nowhere they each did a cartwheel throwing their massive flukes in the air! What a sight to see!! This is
