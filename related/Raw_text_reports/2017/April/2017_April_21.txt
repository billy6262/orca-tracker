Orca Sightings for April 21, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Puget Sound - We watched the T124As traveling between Vashon Island and Three Tree Point
on
April 21, from Chilkat Express. They were swimming along at a leisurely pace until a harbor porpoise surfaced in front of them. The chase was on, and it didn't take very long before they dispatched of the porpoise. One of the killer whales was pursuing from behind, and immediately after the porpoise came up for air, T124A exploded out of the water from right under the porpoise! She flew completely out of the water with the prize in her mouth, and water spraying everywhere! Amazing! -Bart Rulon, naturalist, Puget Sound Express
*

The smaller group arrived later. Lots of tail slaps and a few lunges. It looked like the adults were teaching the baby how to tail slap. I heard them before I could see them because I was blinded by the sun.

A great way to celebrate Earth Day, with magnificent
gray whales off Langley and Gedney Island. First found #44, Dubnuck just north of Langley, then #56 and friend off Gedney. Later in the afternoon, we found #53 Little Patch, and #383,
who is sporting a nice wide, white new scar on his back, making him more easily identifiable! They were bubble blasting as they surfaced, and exhaling stinky whale breath. Wet and windy with choppy gray seas, making taking photos of gray whales in gray seas with a gray sky a bit challenging! The sun finally appeared about

Puget Sound - Case Inlet - May I ask, are they ever in Case Inlet
. There are
at least two whales of the East side of Harstine Island, near the north point
, right now but I don't know how to I.d. Them....There were at least two, they had rather large fins like Orcas but I did not see any white, and it seemed the fin was rather wide at the base compared to my memory of past Orca sightings (20+ years ago) I was in a kayak, my vision is not great, and they were a fair distant. I watched them hunting for about a half hour. Their blow was quite loud. I am thrilled about this but would love to know more. I really thank you for your help. -Kathleen Tucker
