Entry 1:
Unidentified killer whales - Neah Bay - Called this morning from Hobuck beach, Neah Bay at
9:30 am
, woke up looking at the surf and what looked to be
a large male orca with a smaller orca heading north east about 600 yards off shore
. Too far to see any saddle patches or identification of any sort. They were moving pretty fast and passed through the bay in about 7 min. First time see this beautiful creature in the wild! -Audrey Long

It was our day to see the orcas! We got up early, had breakfast then drove to the beach. After checking the e-mail, map and reports my husband looks at me to say: "We may be here awhile. Hey, maybe we should go to
Chambers Bay
, have faith, Desiree!" He was completely right. When we got to the park our son just fell asleep, so the dog and I went to have a look. I saw lots of Harbor porpoise but no orcas. After a long nap the boys found me and I kid you not, not even 10 mins later we saw six orcas with one beautiful baby! Now thats good timing! -Desiree Sauve

Today was really something. I watched Orca's swim in the
Burley Lagoon, then swim under the Purdy Bridge back out into Henderson Bay
. I grew up out there, playing on these shores, so seeing Orca's here is a check off my bucket list. ...Purdy Bridge!!! Traffic was stopped, both directions, as everyone was watching the Orcas. My zoom lens was too much, they were so close...

*

9:30 a.m -
Fantastic group of
5 sighted in Purdy Sandspit/Henderson Bay
this morning. Lots of traffic stopped all along the sandspit with people taking pictures, so pictures and video should be available, (I did not get any). Very unusual to see them
so far south and up into Henderson Bay at the sandspi
t - very shallow water and it was mid-tide when this occurred, so no depth to dive in. They went under bridge to north side, circled around the shallow clam beds...
1 large adult, 4 small (possibly 1 female and several young?
) -Timothy Jackson
*

9:20 a.m. - Orcas in Henderson Bay - Burley Lagoon
- Four orcas (including adult male) came up
Henderson bay
, went under the Purdy bridge and into the burley Lagoon. They spend 5 - 7 minutes in the lagoon and then turned around and went back into Henderson Bay and started heading back south. Most likely feeding, there were a lot of fishermen fishing from the beach and there were other fish jumping in the area. -David Riel
*

9:00 a.m. - They are in Henderson bay
now. Headed into Henderson bay
toward Purdy Bridge
. 2 groups about 3 minutes apart. 4 or 5 in each group. Could hear spouts and they were moving at pretty good pace. They will have to turn around soon as were midway in the Bay. -Tracy Dodge Hamilton
*
0800. Orcas in Carr Inlet
- Sighted pod with one adult male, at least one cow and calf, and other adults. Looked like at least 6 total. They were
headed north towards Purdy in 60'-100' of water
. Hope they were hunting seals! Traveling with some play. Dead end so they will be back through. -Ben Flesher
*

6:30 a.m. - 4-6 Orcas (including an adult male) 100 feet off shore of Maple Hollow Park on Key Peninsula
. Water was like glass, high slack tide, bright sun rising over the Cascades with a strange rainbow "ball" reflecting on the water trail the whales left. Drinking coffee and listening to them breathing, what a morning in the PNW! They were traveling from mouth of Minter Creek and Henderson bay south towards Lakebay. -John Campbell
*
Gray whales -

Entry 7:
2:43 p.m. - There are another 2 grey whales near the tip of Camano island
as well.

12:19 p.m. - At least 3 grey whales at the SE tip of Hat/Gedney Island
. No direction of travel. Just long dives and mystic sea is on scene. Wonderful way to spend a Saturday! -Danielle Pennington
*
Minke whales -

Entry 8:
11:42 a.m. - Solo whale very near shore off Lagoon Point
. I believe it is a
Minke
. Possibly travelling south, but unsure. Similar in size to an Orca. Smooth skin with no bumps on ridge of back. Curved dorsal fin, somewhat similar in shape to that of a female Orca but much smaller. Quite familiar with Gray, Humpback and Orca - definitely not any of those. Too small to be a fin whale, but similar dorsal fin. -Margaret Marshal
*

7:15 p.m. - Humpback in Case Inlet (North Bay) just South of Allyn
...Was milling about half mile South of Allyn. Notes: ...both later Friday and Saturday afternoon and evenings with incoming tide and stayed for several hours. He would arc his back tightly and appear to dive, then would breach mouth open and other times breach and roll. Other times barely break the surface and glide smoothly back down. He appeared to be feeding. We never saw tail slaps or fins. Case Inlet is pretty shallow with a bit deeper channel in the middle. From our house across is about 3/4's of a mile so he is a goodly distance from shore. -Beverly Lynch McCallum
