Entry 3:

7:50 a.m. - 6+ orcas heading north out of Eld Inlet
and traveling at a screaming fast pace toward Dana Passage. I thought I heard a blow inside the house. Looked over my shoulder and they were surfacing right at the sand spit of Cooper Point. -Kim Merriman

They were moving so fast I could barely get out the door with a camera. The land in the photo is

Entry 4:

About

7:20 - we saw 4 possibly 5 Killer whales in front our home on Eld inlet
. We are across from Flap Jack point. There was 1 large male, and 3 possibly 4 smaller whales. No pictures, enjoyed the moment. -Sharesse Fowler
*

Entry 5:
- Juan de Fuca Strait - We went down to Salt Creek Beach (Crescent Bay) west of Port Angeles and saw 2 adult Grey Whales
feeding. I am hoping by the photo's you may be able to find out which ones they are. Had a beautiful sunset to go with this wonderful sighting..-Sandy Thompson Watne

Entry 6:
North Puget Sound -
8:10 p.m. - Grey whale, several spouts sighted off Madrona Beach mid channel closer to Camano
. Slow southern movement, only appears to be one. -Michale Sarver
*
This evening Joe and I saw
5 separate blows around
7:30.
Three were pretty tight together
between Hat Island and Camano
heading to between Hat Island and Jetty. The other 2 were farther apart and on the other side of Hat Island and they seemed to be lingering in the same area with one fairly close to Hat. The sun was low and it illuminated the spray soooo nicely! Oh, we were at our usual park, Grand Ave Park in Everett. -Shelby Hight Fifield
*

6:35-
8:20 p.m. -
From Rucker Hill in Everett, I'm seeing
at least 5 (possibly 6) unique large whale blows (presumably grays)
. The whales are scattered from the reddish tree (left) to the right towards Jetty Island and north towards Tulalip. I finally landed on five total. As the tide changed and the Snohomish river flooded into the sound,
two whales moved up into Tulalip and three stayed in front of the muddy Snohomish water and moved over to Hat Island
. -Amy Willoughby
*
Today, Mystic Sea was out
near Gedney Island
once again, with several of the
gray whales
from the day before. We had sun, clear skies and calm waters as
5 identified gray whales
were feeding and showing flukes as we looked on. Passengers today got good looks at
#21 (Shackleton), #49 (Patch), #53 (Little Patch), #383, and #723 (Lucyfer)
before returning to the docks in Langley, WA at 2pm. -Amy W., Mystic Sea
*

8:20 a.m. - Gray whale spotted mid-Passage @ Bells Beach
, heading toward Langley. I didn't see any whale boats around that would report this, as I have when I've seen the grays this season, so I thought I'd report it. Unable to ID. -Peggy Sullivan
