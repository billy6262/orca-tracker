Orca Sightings for April 25, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
San Juans -
A visit with two whales that have been on my whale bucket list for years---the
T11s. Matriarch T11 "Wakana", estimated to have been born in 1963, was travelling with her 39 year-old son, T11A "Rainy".
Rainy was measured during a drone survey and is
8.9 metres (just over 29 feet) long
, the largest known killer whale we see regularly in the Salish Sea. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu

Mom T11...We encountered the
T11's North West of Beaumont Shoals
in the
afternoon
heading NW. -Andrew Lees,

Today we finally got to meet the
T11's
! Today they came down
Upright Channel about
9:30am
perused Goose Island and Whale Rocks before traveling on to Canada. They were in travel mode up
Haro Strait
. We left them a couple miles south of
Zero Rock at about 3pm
. -Barbara Howitt,

Hammersley Inlet - Alaskan Transient close to shore at Walker Park, Puget Sound
. The Alaskans do not have alpha-numeric numbers because they are so rare. The
T68s and T68Bs
are regular west coast Ts. -Melisa Pinnow, CWR,

OMG - it was incredible. They were fishing the inlet hard, and have been for the past couple of days but today in particular. At one point they separated into two groups...and we look down and just a few feet from shore are two, sliding along just under the surface...couldn't be more than 8' deep and I'm guessing maybe 6'. They were swimming on their sides - we could see their white bodies - adolescent size. (Reminded me of Rubbing Rock) They circled around and must have joined the Shelton group and 3 large whales joined together and powered back towards
Shelton
(all this in front of
Walker Park
area). The 3 came up 3 times that we saw - altogether. Where they come so fast and hard that their heads and top portion of their bodies were out of the water - I'm guessing to get even more momentum. It took them 3 of these pushes to make it from around Chruch Point (tough to tell distance away) all the way to the opposite end in between Eagle and Munson Points near Shelton. At one point they "frolicked" jumping and turning and flipping, and just playing (along the same path that they had just hunted that I mentioned above)...went towards Shelton for a bit...and now I think they've headed out of the inlet. Like I said...they fished it hard!! It looks to me as if there is the large male, a couple of larger females, 3-4 adolescence, and 2 babies. I could see the two babies playing together a lot yesterday. -Becky Wilson

Orcas have been my favorite animal since I was a little girl, and it's always been on my bucket list to see one out in the wild living free - as the should be! I was able to see them today and I couldn't help but to start crying! Such beautiful animals! Thank you so much everyone for your help!! We went between
