I was driving south on highway 99 from Squamish on Saturday,
April 1st around

1:30pm
when we spotted
a pod of orcas swimming southward along the shore of Gambier Island
. It was a pod of several orcas and we watched them for about 15-20 minutes until they were out of sight. We observed their fins and breath spray, no breaching. They were clearly orcas as distinquished by their tall dorsal fin visible even from our vantage point across the water from them. It was a beautiful sighting! They appeared to be traveling south together as a pod. They were mainly just swimming as a group in the south direction near the eastern shore of Gambier Island. We watched them from across the water on highway 99, just north of Brunswick Beach. Any adult Males seen?: I believe so. There were several with dorsal fins taller then the others. -Alissa Turtletaub

7:00 a.m. - We are here at Bells Beach in Saratoga passage and we have a solo gray whale
about 40 to 45 yards just off our shoreline and very shallow waters we believe it's just feeding in the kelp beds it's amazing.
April 1 this is no April fools folks. (It was amazing to see and the Gray stayed for a few hours (7-10) and then moved further out and more towards Langley when another Gray whale joined early this afternoon) -Kristin Carlson

A beautiful day for whale watching! Nice smooth water, some sun, finally, and almost no wind. We quickly caught up with "Sounders" gray
whales #383 and 22
, just north of Langley. We followed these two 40+ ton beautiful giants south
toward Gedney Island
, watching them roll and dive together. We then turned north toward
Camano Head
, and found
#56
. On the afternoon trip, we spent more time with all three, even watching them sleep. They sleep with half their brain still awake, so they can surface and breathe, while they gently bob just under the surface. Captain Erik also found 4 bald eagles on the north side of Camano Island, and we caught glimpses of the elusive harbor porpoises. Another incredible day with lovely whales! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Around

4:00 p.m. - Saw a number of grey whales off of Cape Flattery
. It was hard to say they, seemed to be feeding around that island with the lighthouse. We could only see spouts. Everytime we they surfaced there were quite a few spouts, like 5 or 6 every surface. I don't know how many whales that equates to though. -Nathan Michael
