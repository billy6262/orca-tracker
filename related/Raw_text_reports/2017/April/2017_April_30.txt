Orca Sightings for April 30, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
1:00 a.m. - Saanich - 5-7 orcas in Patricia Bay
(west side of Saanich Peninsula, north of Victoria BC) early this afternoon. Appeared to be hunting/feeding. Also noticed heads fully out of water and tail slapping. Whole group approached boat. -Bradley Fisher
(
Looks like the
T46Bs
. - Melisa Pinnow, CWR
)
*
Incoming Admiralty to Puget Sound
- First saw orcas come into
Elliot bay around
7:45
. Started with a miles away teeny spyhop. The group was coming SE at a normal pace, then did some showy business and started milling. They got to a point that is "go time" for me to get back behind lighthouse. As we approached the car I saw
two very close to shore on the Alki side
. So, naturally I got distracted and went to look. Then I had a feeling that those two were going down and sneaking over to lighthouse. That, is exactly what they did. We raced backed over there, just as the giant bulls surfaced. I missed the shot. I am quite sure someone got one. There were many folks out there. There were at least a dozen seals and sealions. It was as still as night and eerily quiet. As the bulls porpoised at a painfully slow rate we all thought we were going to see a horror show. They were liquid in their movements....no sound. It was almost dark, the sun was setting. None of the seals or lions moved or seemed to care. The sealions were even thermoregulating. It was bizarre. But they clan moved on, into the sunset and darkness. -Kersti Muul

7:50 p.m. - Looks like they may be heading past Alki
. Looks to be spread out. 2+ near eastern side of channel and 3+ on western side of channel heading south. -Melissa Mitchell

7:30 p.m. -
They were slowly heading south/ west mid channel. They
crossed the ferry channel & Bainbridge ferry
probably got a nice view. I also saw a couple harbor porpoise near Magnolia shore. -Suzanna Joor

7:00 p.m. - pod of 5+ Incl. adult male now out from Shilshole
probably. I think I saw another male approx a mile ahead and further west. All southbound. I need to leave, good luck.

next. Steady pace east of mid channel, loosely grouped. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

. Steady progress. 6-8 plus a large male in the rear.

4:55 p.m. - See them still heading south. Line of sight is Apple Tree Point
to southwest tip of Whidbey. I'm terrible at judging where they are in the channel but would say they are mid-channel. -Sarah Frey
*

4:20-
4:45pm -
I spotted them from
Eglon
, hugging the Whidbey side and following a WW Boat. I saw
one Bull + 4-5 others
- they were so far I couldn't tell much else. Traveling south at medium speed, then long down times before I lost sight as they approached the tip of Whidbey, guessing they would continue south along Mukilteo/Edmonds shoreline. DIdn't have internet out there, sorry for late post! Here are the little orca specks. -Donna Green VanRenselaar

Juan de Fuca - The Alaskan Unknowns was seen on
April 30th at Race Rocks
by us SpringTide whale watching and some other boats. They traveled with the
T068, T068A (both confirmed with pictures) and possible T068C's.
Possible that they left the Salish Sea because they traveled west. -Marcus Bergstrom,

Entry 2:
12:45 p.m. -
4:30 p.m.
- I went out to check on
a reported humpback in North Bay in upper Case Inlet, turns out there were two
. Down times were long and travel irregular so I didn't know there were 2 for over an hour until they surfaced at the same time several hundred yards apart. Also for about the first hour I wasn't hearing or seeing robust exhalations nor any flukes, so was getting a bit concerned. I was seeing lunges (no pecs visible), but was difficult at first due to distance to confirm lunge feeding which is what it turned out they were doing. Eventually I was hearing and seeing robust blows and travel seemed fairly normal so my concern diminished.
The whales traveled
back and forth between Rocky Point and south of Victor (to the east side) & Allyn (to the west)
, but spent most time somewhere in the middle , at times very close to shore on the east side, traveling and lunge feeding. Once I moved closer and had a better view I was seeing what appeared to be
rather huge schools of forage fish
(later confirmed by locals). Some gulls swooping but not too many up there (nothing at all like typical bait ball scenerio) Beautiful whales. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Noon
- Unmistakable
humpback whale in Case inlet near Allyn WA
. Feeding. -Peter Benda,

Entry 3:
*

10:35 am - Humpback is back in Case Inlet
, North Bay, moving across the Inlet back and forth and down long periods. -Beverly Lynch McCallum
*

9:16 -
seeing blows and now angling towards north. Still mid channel between Whidbey and Hat.

9:05 a.m. -
just saw whale surface and fluke about halfway between Cl
inton Beach and southeast end of Hat Island
. Looks to be heading towards Hat. No definitive ID but presume gray. Will keep looking that direction - saw from living room! -Debbie Stewart
