Entry 1:
Included is a photo of an
Orca taken just past Deception Pass - Rosario Strait - at around approximately
10:30am

ID's by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "Yep, that's T68 and T68A again. And definitely the right fin shapes for T68B and maybe T68B1. There also seems to be a T68B look-a-like in there too so maybe those U's might be still with them too."

San Juans - Legacy and Peregrine found
a group of transient killer whales in Haro Strait
and observed them cruising right past a huge Steller Sea Lion who didn't look too comfortable about their close proximity. They split ways to explore the area and found a myriad of other species throughout their respective trips. J1 spent time with
another group of transients to the north
, including two young calves. On the way back they checked out the beautiful scenery of the
BC Gulf Islands
. -Mayas Legacy

close to shore near the exchange side right now. Tried to get good pictures but it's super windy and rainy, unfortunately. -Janna Harmon
*
Possession Sound - Gray whale #383
is one of my faves this season. He's the first gray I have ever seen spyhopping! He was one in
a group of 3 (22, 49 and 383) who may have been hit by a private boat today
. We encountered 21 and 383 (after the incident) northwest side of Gedney if I recall correctly. We started on the southeast side with
53 and 723
, then left them to see if we could find the others. We were almost all the way around the island when we found 383 and 21. -Renee Beitzel
*
One of the North Puget Sound gray whales was struck by a small recreational boat this morning before 11 am near Hat/Gedney Island.
Erin Gless and Stephanie Raymond, Naturalists from the Victoria Clipper, messaged and called us, reporting that a cabin cruiser ran over the back of one of three gray whales that were feeding together off Hat Island. No blood was observed - the whales were surface active both before and after the boat strike, so they didn't observe any behavior change. They were not sure which of the whales was actually hit. Present were gray
#22, #49, or #383
.
*
At the time of the incident Chilkat was with
grays 53 and 723
per Renee Beitzel.
*
Whales here, there and everywhere with tail flukes prominent on our morning trip.
Patch #49, #383 and #723 were positively identified south of Gedney (Hat) Island, with #21 spotted later swimming towards the Gedney shoreline.
April showers and a chill breeze did not dampen passengers' spirits as the Saratoga grays displayed their grace and splendor both together and apart, once again enabling us to marvel at the sheer magnificence of these incredible creatures as they make their way north on their annual migration. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
