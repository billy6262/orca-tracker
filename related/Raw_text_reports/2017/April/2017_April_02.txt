Breaching "Big Mama" - Humpback BCY0324
- off the south end of San Juan Island, Washington. -Capt Alan Niles, Maya's Legacy,

Entry 2:

Haro Strait Off south end San Juan Island -
We are so well known for our Orca out here that sometimes its easy to overlook
the amazing humpback whales
that grace or sea. This is the whale that began the return of the humpbacks back in 2001. We call her
Big Mamma
and she is big as well as at least a 6 time mamma that we know of. Today she gave us a surprise by breaching twice during our encounter with her. What a treat! -Alan Niles, Maya's Legacy WW

It was really cool to watch the
T36As and T99s work the shoreline trying to get at the harbor seals. T99, matriarch of the T99s, front and center with her kids & the T36A family. Just north of Active Pass
, Galiano shoreline. -Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

Thanks to awesome spotting by another vessel, we headed up all the way to
the mouth of Active Pass
in beautiful British Columbia and had a fun encounter with
Bigg's (transient) Killer whales, (T36As and T99s)

With a blustery wind out of the north-west and whitecaps greeting us as Mystic Sea headed north in Saratoga Passage from Langley Marina, it wasn't long before we encountered
California gray whale #21 and, we believe, #22
. Tail flukes were not prominent on this occasion making identification more difficult in the choppy seas, but spy-hops (when the whale's head comes above the surface to look around) were! Time after time we watched as one or both whales checked out the surroundings, displaying an intense curiosity seen more often in the warmer waters of Baja where they are born. After leaving these two whales to continue on their way north, we encountered another of our returning Saratoga grays,
#53 (Little Patch)
, traveling in the same direction with purpose. Maybe all three whales eventually met up with the two gray whales reported earlier feeding near Oak Harbor, and that's where the party is today. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
