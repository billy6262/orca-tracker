Orca Sightings for April 27, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Before this month, these two orcas (presumably AK female mother and calf) currently traveling with the
Bigg's/Transient T068s and T068Bs had only been seen a few times near Alaska
. Now that there is a bit more information on them, they will each be assigned an alphanumeric designation from researchers. At
Walker Park on Hammersley Inlet near Shelton, WA
. -Gayle Swigart

Hammersley Inlet -
Thank you for the updates it was such a blessing to get to see them! -Micah-Sylvia Caldwell,

Entry 2:

Posted

3:45 p.m. -
Was out with them on my kayak for atleast 2 hours , they stayed
in Oakland harbor
pretty much the whole time until they turned east towards Walker park and we thought they were leaving but they suddenly turned around and went back to Oakland bay and are there right now . Lots of splashing , spy hops , tail slaps , pectoral slaps , breaches etc. -Amy Schierhoff

This same pod stayed in the west end of
Hammersley
all day. I watched all day except for about 3 hours so... But it looks like they may be fishing against the tide. (??) They swim quickly with the tide, without much action other than surfacing to breath, and then often hung out at one end of my view (with binoculars) Sometimes playing, splashing, breeching, swimming on their backs, tails in the air, and then they'd swim slowly back in the opposite directions, against the tide. The tide is extremely fast/strong in Hammersley but I don't think that was the full reason they were swimming slowly back against it. (I am on, and nearby, the Walker Park side, and can see from Shelton marina to the end of E Rose Valley Rd on the opposite side.) -Becky Wilson

Tail slapping baby breaching just west of Walker Park. We can see them great here at the park. -Kirsten Story

Entry 6:
Gray Whales and found them, 6 of them
in fact! We cruised towards
Gedney Island
and when we reached the southeast side, we came upon our gray whale friends as they displayed various behaviors. Four of the six gray whales were identified by crew as numbers
21 (Shackleton), 49 (Patch), 383, and 723 (Lucyfer)
. The sky was mostly sunny and blue as we looked on at these majestic creatures. Four of the whales were feeding in the shallows while the other two swam and tail fluked out a bit further. Those on board got some nice looks at flukes of Patch and 383, rolls from each whale, and even a few heart-shaped blows....- Amy W., Mystic Sea
