southwest side of Whidbey Island
! We took the chance and made the journey and much to our delight, Captain Nate spotted some scattered transient orcas coming our way! This pod was soon joined by another pod, the
T68's
. There was lots and lots of activity - breaching, rubbing, tail slapping, and tons of other social behaviors! Throughout our encounter, these two pods were joined by two MORE pods to make a super pod of four different families. IT WAS AWESOME!!! We're still working on the ID's of all the animals involved in this sighting. -Island Adventures

April 20 - Samsun Narrows - T86As & T124Ds (w/new calf). So on today's tour I managed to get shots that show T86A3 (Tyndall) is a girl! I was excited. This is the sequence, no edits aside from cropping and adding a watermark have been made. It was just
north of Samsun Narrows around Booth Bay, Saltspring Island around
1:30pm. We had the T86A's and T124D's with a new calf.
-Ashley Keegan,

Entry 5:

NEW CALF! T124D and T124D2 and T124D and T086A1 northbound in Sansum Narrows this morning
. -Mark Malleson
*

Entry 6:
Rosario - T49As & T65As.
We headed south of Lopez to look for Transient Orcas coming down from Rosario Strait. When we found them there appeared to be
4 separate groups traveling parallel to one another in the shipping lane
. We were able to identify two of the groups as the T65As and T49As.
T49A1 was traveling with the 65As
while his family was 1/2 mile to the North. We left them passing the RA buoy before sailing for home. -Barbara & David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

Whales further south today... With all eyes on the water after leaving Langley Marina, our first sighting was of
gray whale #383 off the south end of Gedney (Hat) Island, soon to be followed by spotting Patch (#49) and traveling companion #56
keeping us guessing as to where they would surface next. Being downwind of the pair brought its own reward with the unique aroma of whale breath carrying on the wind to heighten our wildlife experience!
#21 and #22
, often seen together this spring, also delighted passengers as the duo moved in leisurely fashion to their next feeding spot or, perhaps, to meet up with other visiting Saratoga grays under the afternoon's sunny skies. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
