Strait of Georgia - There have been some
big groups of transient orcas in the Salish Sea
this Spring. Yesterday we caught up with a large group made up of several families in the Strait of Georgia. This big guy is

. 49 was seen around
3:00 pm off of Camano Head, did not re-aquire. -Tyrone Reed
*
We have been seeing lots of
gray whales 21 and 22 together
. Over the years I've noticed that these two whales seem to hang out with each other more consistently than any other gray whales we see. The close up photo of the whale's head is of male gray whale 21. I've noticed that these gray whales have a regular tendency of lifting their heads higher out of the water right after feeding in shallow water when they just begin to swim out of the shallows. The tail fluke photos are from female gray whale 22 on 4/14/17. She has beautiful patterns on her flukes! -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Puget Sound Express
