9:50 a.m. -
The
pair of bottlenose dolphins is hanging out off West Seattle
again this morning...just spotted off
Me Kwa Mooks Park
, southbound, and another watcher said they have been circling there for a while. (I got a good look at their beaks through binos, they were raising them out of the water as they surfaced. Solid grey, no eye stripe.) -Stephanie Raymond
*

8:50 a.m. -
As I was leaving
Me Kwa Mooks
a pedestrian told me his wife had called him fifteen minutes prior claiming "the same whales that were by
Lincoln Park
yesterday" had just passed by heading north. I tend to believe it was more likely the dolphins I'd been watching for 40 minutes, but thought I'd share anyway.

8:30 a.m. -
I have been watching
two dolphins
milling and apparently feeding around the white floats at the south end of M
e Kwa Mooks Park in West Seattle
for about half an hour. I believe these are commons and not bottlenose. Sorry, the camera on my phone is inoperable. (I did not get a real look at beaks at all. I thought I saw an eye stripe but was having a very difficult time assessing coloration. Early morning sun was reflecting gold for sure, and may very well have been responsible for the "eye stripes" I thought I saw. Dorsals seemed less commanding than that of the single bottlenose I saw in same area a few weeks ago.) -Jason Lee Bell
