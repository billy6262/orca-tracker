Entry 6:
Biggs T137s were heading north in Saratoga Passage
, so off to Shangrila Shores to watch them northbound ....to my house to see them continue north, to
Harrington Lagoon
where they were closer to shore, to
Long Point
to see them near Penn Cove, to the
Coupeville Boat Launch
to watch them enter Penn Cove,
to the mussel rafts
to watch them have lunch (seal) by the rafts,
to the Coupeville wharf
to see them begin their exit from Penn Cove, and
then to TOBY's to watch them leave Penn Cove
- from the nice warm Tavern. Such a tough life! And to meet up with so many Orca Dorks - more than I've ever seen watching whales along Whidbey Shores. Particularly Bonnie Gretz and Michelle Booker (and Daniel)! Then ... the dilemma - if we just have one drink at Toby's we'd have time to head to the west side of Whidbey to see K-pod and the L54s as they head north T137 - mom - born 1983...her offspring: T137A, T137D, T137B. hmmmmm. -Jill Hein

heading out. -Cynthia Vick Allen

3:10 p.m. - 3 orcas in the west end of Penn Cove
by the mussel rafts, heading back out now. -Brian Miller

2:15 p.m. - T137 and her youngest T137D
. - Lovely afternoon with
T137's
.T137A born 2002. First saw them just off Long Point at the entrance to Penn Cove, then watched at the mussel docks as they made a kill, and then they took their sweet time heading out. Lots of people saw them and were so excited! Photo by Bonnie Gretz,

dolphins today at Jack Block Park in Elliot Bay!
I could not tell if they were common dolphins or the recently reported bottlenose (
yes bottlenose
), but there were 2 swimming together. It looked like they were hunting as they stayed in a pretty small area between Salty's restaurant and Jack Block's Pier, circling. Unfortunately, I only got one picture before the battery in my phone died, and it is not very good, but here it is: -Annika Bowden
