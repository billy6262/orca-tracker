Orca Sightings for November 7, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
10:00 a.m. - A pod of orcas
, looks like transients,
off the east coast of Decatur Island, heading south down Rosario Strait
. Several Breaches and tail flaps. Quite a sight for all the people on the ferry. 10 a.m. on Tuesday
November 7th. Well I saw them from the ferry. I didn't get any pics and they were pretty far in the distance but they were heading south just in front of James Island east of Decataur. I got a somewhat reasonably good look at two males hanging close together and noticed their dorsal fins were very pointed, more like transients. I then saw females and calves in the distance cavorting around....I saw
about 10 orcas
at various times....hat is probably about the best estimate of numbers I can give (plus or minus 2-3)...That is about all I can say. I wanted to send it off to you right away so that whale watching boats might have a chance to encounter them. Did anyone go check them out? I'd be curious at what anyone found out about them. -Mariann Carrasco

Entry 2:
7:58 a.m. -
So, on the
Bremerton ferry
now, and saw something I hadn't seen before (between commuting via ferry and my passion for boating, I've seen ALOT out here!) Just looked out (that little bay on the north side of rich passage just after the east entrance) to see 3 dolphins leaping in unison. That's a first...They leapt together probably 5 times like that. All the same distance apart and synchronized....Anyway, I remember reading on this page over the summer there were reports of a sighting of southern dolphins in Puget Sound. Perhaps these were them? -Rhonda RaderJungquist

Coastal killer whales -

Entry 3:
3 orcas
yesterday, Nov. 7, on the north end of
Depot Bay OR
, milling about 150 yds off the shore for an hour from
3 to 4 PM
. One was "much bigger" than the others.
