What kind of
dolphins
do we have this time of year? I just saw the biggest one I've ever seen here off
Browns Point. (Tacoma)
. After further discussion: Absolutely
bottle nose
! I see a lot of commons and porpoises. This guy was massive in comparison. It was headed south, into
Commencement bay
. Surfaced 3 times before I lost sight. -Patricia Peachy Reagan
Puget Sound Bottlenose dolphins update - It's a match! Through many sighing reports (some submitted by many of you to Orca Network) Cascadia Research, in collaboration with their California colleagues, have matched one of the visting Puget Sound bottlenose dolphins to an individual known as "Miss". She is part of a California coastal stock and is well known to researchers, first photographed in southern California in 1983!
