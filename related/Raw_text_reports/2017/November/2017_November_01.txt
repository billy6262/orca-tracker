Entry 4:
Puget Sound/Admiralty Inlet
- Day report: Fascinating pass yesterday, Nov. 1, by
members of J pod
were taken from
Vista Way, Whidbey Is. from
11:33 to
12:28 then from the lighthouse at Bush Pt. from
12:37 to
1:08.
I think I got the leaders heading north up Admiralty Inlet in the first shots, and the last ones were passing Bush Pt. at the end. The leaders were acting normal, very spread out with little surface action until
11:37. I thought they had all passed so I came back home to get the car to head to Bush Pt. when Susan saw the rowdy group through the bigeyes coming up slowly, close to shore. I went back out to the bluff and shot at less than a mile range from

11:50 to
12:28
. Arrived at Bush Pt. at
12:37 where Dick Snowberger and Sandra Pollard had been for a while with the rowdy group approaching 1/2 mile south and less than 1/4 mile from shore in a tide rip. The closeups of intense group surface activity continued until
12:44 when the rowdy group disappeared and drifted westward and even south before trending back northward. At that point out past mid-channel about 5-6 of them started logging for several minutes. At least a couple of others were breaching way across beyond the south end of Marrowstone.
J27 south of Bush Point.
Whatever was going on with the intense tactile socializing remains a mystery. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

Being fortunate in seeing members of the Southern Resident community tends to be a bitter-sweet experience knowing the continuing challenges they face. Living on Whidbey Island we were fortunate to enjoy a mesmerizing encounter with
some of J-pod breathtakingly close to shore
today and witnessed a range of social and tactile behaviors, including one 'surf whale' taking full advantage of a tanker's wake. The whales seemed to be in no hurry to exit Admiralty Inlet, often just logging at the surface and milling. After their prolonged absence this summer, it was a privilege to have them back again in Puget Sound. All the photos (below by Richard Snowberger) were taken from Bush Point early afternoon (between approx. noon and
1:00).

4:35 p.m. - Starting to hear calls on Port Townsend hydrophone
. -Susan Marie Andersson
*

4:30 p.m. - 3 or 4 more, south of Pt Townsend
, slowly going north....too far for ids or pics, but yeah! I had a nice look at the leading group, even came a bit closer to Whidbey so I could see their saddle patches, but no id. Got too cold and dark....and there were one or two more behind

4:16 p.m. - At Ft Casey
, see one male so far, mid channel, a few small boats, just south of Pt Townsend. -Bonnie Gretz
*

3:48 p.m. - more (4 or more) passing Lagoon Point
northbound.

3:21 p.m. - Saw whale from my house on Smugglers Cove Road (Lagoon Point)
northbound. -Patricia Prochaska
*

1:30 p.m. -
some still passing Bush Point, 25-30 total. Very strange socializing by one group. (That trailing rowdy group that kept writhing around on each other and breaching and spyhopping close to shore right up to Bush Pt. then drifting off the west and even back south, then logging all together for maybe five minutes, while all the rest except those breachers across on the Olympic side just kept plodding north).

12:52 p.m. -
Jan Bell reported
6 orcas off Bush Pt
, mid-channel splashing and heading N in Admiralty Inlet
*

12:10 p.m. - Orcas mid channel Admiralty Inlet, about 2 miles south of Bush Point, heading slowly North
. -Mike Meyer

11:55 a.m. -
Karen Anderson called to report seeing the
orcas from Windmill Heights, off N Mutiny Ba
y heading north in two small groups.
*

12:04 p.m. -
Very difficult to determine what's going on! lots of spyhop, taillobs, upside down and sideways swimming, direction changes, all in one very tight, tactile group. Howard and hopefully others are getting photos, so hope to have IDs soon. they are close to the Whidbey side, staying in same area just north of Mutiny bay.

11:45 a.m. - they are 1 mile south of Bush Pt. A tight pod of 5 or 6
has been hunting something for the last 15 minutes, behavior and fins look more like possible Transients, but unable to see the prey or saddle patches yet. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

11.30 a.m - Seeing whales heading north from Mutiny Sands
mid channel. -Sandra Pollard
*

11:25 a.m. - Got em, male dorsals, north end of Mutiny Bay
heading north mid-channel. -Howard Garrett, Orca Network

8:51 a.m. - Large pod by mid channel yellow buoy marker near Point No Point headed north
(up Admiralty Inlet). They were really spread out...there had to be at least 8. -Whitney Gabrielle
