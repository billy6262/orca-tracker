Entry 3:

An unexpected encounter with
J-Pod
is a perfect reason to update the blog with photos from today and other recent wildlife encounters. "...We thought we needed to go a ways to catch up with them when I spotted a whale right
near Point Caution
just north of Friday Harbor. I zoomed in on the first photo I took and spotted a large "finger" on the saddle patch - something you don't see on transients! It was
J17 Princess Angeline and her youngest J53 Kiki
..."
4:15 p.m. - L87 past Friday Harbor still going south, J16s still trailing somewhere to the north. -Monika Wieland Shields

1:00 p.m. - Saw 3 Orca in San Juan Channel
Saturday afternoon from around
1300 hours to 1600 hours
-- appeared to be one male and 2 females -- saw one breach, but whales didn't seem to be headed in any particular direction -- back and forth in mid channel. Feeding? Possibly feeding owing to back and forth nature of travel. -Mark Aberle

Thar she blows! WOW! We just had a grey whale IN the marina. First saw it while putting up Christmas lights about 75-feet off the port beam, then even further into the marina towards shore. Got a few seconds on video on its way out. Exciting! -Pacific NW Boater FB page
