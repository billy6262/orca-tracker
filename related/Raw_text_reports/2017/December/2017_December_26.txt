Orca Sightings for December 26, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Unidentified whales - Observed
a single whale around 11am in the Saratoga Passage
today, it was heading north. Was not very large but definitely a whale. Dorsal fin was rather small and situated towards the back of its body. Had flocks of birds near it. Thinking Minke whale? -Boris Pavlovic
*

10:53 a.m. - Just saw a single small whale heading north off of our beach (4 miles north of Greenbank)
heading north. Couldn't determine what it was, but we watched it for a few minutes before we lost it. It was black & at least one dorsal was visible...it was moving fast. -Marie Gill
*
Porpoise -

Entry 2:
2:15 p.m. - Fairly certain there is a large pod of porpoise coming into Penn Cove
now. -Kelley Neal Myers
*
We saw a
group of porpoise at the mouth of Penn Cove around
1:00
and they hung around for about an hour. It appears there was a large amount of fish in the water due to birds and seals hanging around also. -Kristi Miller Brown
