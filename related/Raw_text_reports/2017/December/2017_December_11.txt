Kingston Orca Sightings
12-11-2017...feeding, with some surface activity. We observed
multiple orcas (10-12)
while blackmouth fishing
between 11 and 3pm.
We first observed a large male surfacing
near Apple Tree Point
, then a few smaller whales nearby. All were headed south toward Jefferson Head, into the tide and wind. Around 1pm, we noticed significant surface whale activity a mile or two from our boat, with the activity just south of the Edmonds/Kingston Ferry Lane, and about two miles east of Kingston. This appeared to be
about 8-10 whales
all splashing around at the same time, but the 10 knot south wind and waves made observation difficult, and we couldn't see much other than the splashing. While we estimate there were approximately 10-12 whales in the area, most were in smaller groups except for the midchannel group splashing activity. We presume the whales were feeding on the numerous small hatchery chinook salmon around 80 feet down. -Randy Heath
*
Dana Lyons reported
orcas at Bush Pt. at
8:35 am
, headed south in Admiralty Inlet toward Puget Sound!
*
Humpback whales -

Entry 3:
11:09 a.m - Single humpback whale south of Sooke about 5 miles
. Heading east bound fast. -Deanna Brett, Love Sooke
*
Unidentified whales -

Entry 4:
a Gray whale (or maybe humpback?) sighting off N. Camano Island
this afternoon around

3:30 pm
. The observer's sister called in the report, a short video was taken but we have not seen that yet - it was reported to be rolling around and active, so
maybe a humpback, or gray whale feeding?
