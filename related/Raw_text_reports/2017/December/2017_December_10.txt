Orca Sightings for December 10, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait - 5 a.m. a couple SRKW calls over the Lime Kiln hydrophones
. So they were in the area then, but I haven't heard anything since. -Jeanne Hyde
*
Porpoise -

Entry 2:
5-6 groups of harbor porpoises between Steilacoom and McNiel island
for the past few days. Hard to tell exactly how many in each group but I estimate 6-7. Been fun to watch. -Nick Sue
