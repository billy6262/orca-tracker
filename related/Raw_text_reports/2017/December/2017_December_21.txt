Orca Sightings for December 21, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sighting on Whidbey Island in Coupeville
next to Port Townsend ferry around 4pm
today by Lauren Forgas. Two videos by Lauren shared to and by Q13 showing
at least 5 orcas (including 2 bulls, female (s) and young)
just feet from shore on the north side of ferry and boat launch, just north of the Keystone spit.
IDs from THIS VIDEO: "The males look like T75A and T77B. It was probably the T75s and T77s traveling together", -Melisa Pinnow, Center for Whale Research

Lighthouse. Called in by Anna Sindayo (sp?) and Pip Gordon, with a Happy Solstice!

December 21- Admiralty Inlet - I assumed there would be a lot of reports since there were a few people out there watching. I happened to stop at the
Keystone boat launch
on
December 21 and noticed a disturbance in the water about 50 yards offshore and soon noticed there were
orcas, two large males, four (?) females and a couple of little guys.
As they moved closer to shore, about 20 yards, I noticed one of the males was pushing a
rather larger pinniped
which was wrapped around his nose. The pod was taking turns playing with (beating the crap out of) the pinniped which occasionally rose to the surface for a breath but was soon dragged down. After a half hour or so of this behavior the pod slowly moved offshore and a very tired subadult male Stellers Sea Lion about 2-3 meters long swam slowly to shore but upon noticing me and two others watching, swam back out and parallel to the beach to the east. The sea lion did not have any apparent wounds and was able to swim slowly. The orca pod continued to travel slowly into Admiralty Inlet. They made no further attempt to encounter the sea lion. I have three thirty second iPhone videos which I will share if you want them. Unfortunately, I don't think they show the sea lion. -Happy new year! Dave Parent
