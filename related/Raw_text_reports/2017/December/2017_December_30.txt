Entry 4:
orcas seen heading north in San Juan Channel
, I went to scan from
Reuben Tarte County Park and spotted them along the San Juan Island shoreline
. They appeared to make a kill south of O'Neal island before continuing north past Reuben Tarte and west through Spieden Channel. It was
a group of the T75s: T75B with T75B2 and apparent new calf T75B3, and T75C with apparent new calf T75C1, for a total of five whales
....
2017 has been, from start to finish, the year of the transients. There have been more than double the number of sightings of marine mammal eating killer whales in the Salish Sea this year compared to last year, and their occurrences were already trending up. As the year ends, we look forward to beginning to summarize what we documented this year compared to other years. It's thus appropriate we had the chance to see this group of Ts (T75s) today in San Juan Channel, likely our last orca sightings of 2017! -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 5:
T49As
relayed to and by Monika Wieland Shields who did see them herself).
4 orcas
were observed foraging and feeding about 200 yards off of the east side of
Reef Island just outside of Deer Harbor
. We hopped in a kayak to take a closer look, and the air smelled heavily of fish and there were scraps of food all over the water near the whales, which the seagulls were feasting on. The whales then moved west into the San Juan Channel towards Jones Island. There was
1 male, 2 females, and 1 baby
. The picture shows a female surfacing just north of Reef Island...(see below) We saw them first at 3pm and watched them head into SJ channel around
330pm
. I'm curious as to what they were eating, as it didn't appear as if they were eating any big mammals like seals but from our kayak it was clear that they were feeding because of all of the food scraps all over the surface. Once we returned to our beach on the southern tip of spring point after the whales were into the channel, we noticed that a seal was hanging out in 3 feet of water like it was hiding from the whales, a place I have never seen a seal before. -Jack Albright

12:45 p.m. -
WSF reports
3 orcas between Shaw and Orcas
.

Coastal killer whales -
December 30 - Oregon coast - Then another call came in from another observer (Brita Clothier) who upped the
estimate to 20-25
, and who took a video which she will share and we'll share it here if possible.
Update: Thanks to the video (below) from Brita Clothier, we were able to share with Melisa Pinnow, CWR, and she thinks they are Residents,
possibly some of L pod
(this is from a distant video, so not a firm ID - but given the numbers of orcas very likely to be Residents -SB
)
Tillamook, Oregon. Possibly Southern Residents
. -Video by Brita Clothier,

Entry 6:

11:56 a.m. -
Coastal sighting report from Jim Border at the tip of Cape Lookout in
Tillamook OR, who saw 15-20 orcas
a couple of hundred yards from shore, spread out in 2s and 3s, all traveling steadily northward.

Received a call from Jim Berry about a sighting, 12/30, about

11:30AM, from Ecola State Park, at Tillamook Head, of a single orca, 3-5 miles from shore
, heading south.
