Orca Sightings for December 16, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
The
T46s & T122 were near Turn Point
& we made a slight detour to see them on the way home. (L to R -
T46, T46F, T46E, & the tip of T122's dorsal
). Right before we left the T30Bs joined up with T75, T75A, and the T77s for a beautiful passby. (In this shot, L to R - T77C, T77E, T75A, T77, T77B, T75, and just surfacing is T77D). - T30B T30B2 -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

The
T75s and some of the T77s in a resting pattern south of Discovery Island
, Dec. 16. Front to back:
T75, T77 (baby T77E
is just starting to surface in between them),
T75A, and T77C.
it's believed T75 and T77 are mother-daughter, so this was a family gathering. Perfect for the holiday season! -Photo by Valerie Shore,
