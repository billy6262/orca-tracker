Orca Sightings for December 4, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait - Well, folks. I don't know what else to say but...
J Pod is being faintly heard over the Lime Kiln hydrophones - now!
4:47pm
12-4-17 Now they might not get much louder, or maybe they will. But they are in the area and that is oh, so, dear to my heart! -Jeanne Hyde

4:32 p.m. - Definitely orcas. I think i've heard J pod calls
, but they are not close so it's hard to tell. Whoever, they are quite talkative...this was a great night for J and I think L pod calls in Haro...After all the boats (2 bulk carriers and 6 Canadian Military ships) had passed, I could still hear our pod(s) in the distance...so I hope that good eats was the reason they stuck around. -EJ Evans
*

4:06 p.m. - Picking up calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone
. Infrequent & far away. -Julie Kimberlin
*

Entry 2:
6:45 I switched to the Orcasound
Lab Hydro and heard something that sounded much more
like the humpback
from the other night...some squeaks, but A LOT of "grumbling" and "burping" mixed with it, a tail or fin slap and even something that sounded like someone blowing on a microphone... Very cool, can't wait to hear who/what I was listening to. -EJ Evans
*

6:35 p.m. - There is a Humpback making really interesting vocals on the orcasound hydrophone
right now! Plus
intermittent Jpod vocals on Lime Kiln
! -Traci Walter
*

6:16 p.m. - Now there is an
HB on Lime Kiln and something on OS.
..!!! Wild times on the HPs tonight! adding: on LK HPs it sounded like trumpeting sounds and on OS some of those squeaks an HB makes. of course it lasted only seconds. The HB is on OS and still going on and on. Today there was a young HB between OS and LK Hps from morning, when Ken Balcomb saw it and this afternoon when it came down to the lighthouse and then turned and went back up. Don't know it that's the one who is making all that noise. -Jeanne Hyde
