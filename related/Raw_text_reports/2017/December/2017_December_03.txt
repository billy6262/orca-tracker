Orca Sightings for December 3, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents -

4:35 p.m.
- Marilyn Armbruster and I watched
5-6 heading north between Maxwelton and Point No Point
in the almost dark. (Looking at some video I shot - 2 male and 3 female/young. Not sure if there were more. It was pretty dark by the time they got that far...Yes, NW out of Admiralty. We watched them north of PNP, passing Maxwelton, but it was too dark too see them before they got as far as the west end of Useless Bay.) -Connie Bickerton

4:18 p.m. -
I was with them with the IE3. I have several ID'd as
K pod
. I did not see any J's or L's, but starting to go through pictures on the computer here shortly. Definitely K pod. -Angela Nicholson
*

3:50 p.m. - Three Orcas off Pilot Point heading north.
Mid channel. Two females and a male. While riding the clipper South. Passed them at about 1550. Amazing creatures. -Chris Brown
*

3:47 p.m. -
the group is aimed Admiralty passing in front of
Cultus Bay
. Traveling northwest. They're closer to Whidbey. -Melinda Barajas
*

3:39 p.m. -
We're just seeing them swimming slowly north, no tail slaps or anything exciting. What am I talking about! It's always exciting to see Orcas, even if they're "just" swimming!

3:27 p.m. - The Orcas are by Pilot Point
, about 2/3 of the way north between Kingston and Point No Point. There is a small green hulled boat that has been following them, that has a standup seat in the bow. They are still slowly heading north, but it appears that the group has shrunk dramatically, so I'm not sure where the bulk of them went. The green hulled boat meandered around a little like they had lost them, until 4 cropped back up now still proceeding north, still on the west side of the channel, heading north. (Research boat is on scene - ALB) -Steve Marczewski
*

3:00 p.m. - mostly past Apple Tree Point Kingston
, spread out west side of shipping channel and north/south as well. More steady NB towards PNP with some foraging, occasional breach, tail lob....They were really spread out (all directions) when they were north of Kingston. Some were stopping to forage.
K21 passing Apple Cove Point, Kingston
with NOAA researchers further out in the channel. They definitely seemed committed to Admiralty. -Sara Frey

Ever so slow northbound progression while skirting south end of Port Madison. They are west of southbound shipping lanes. Nice to see so many blows from across the Sound which is pretty calm. Viewing From Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. Clipper left, IA remains with them. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

California -

Just got a call from Irene Longcrier as she watched about
3-4 orcas off Chapman Point
, inside the buoy (?), about a mile south of Mendocino. She says they are black with some white, and there are one or two very large dorsal fins. She says they come in in the morning from the south and leave toward the south.

Entry 6:
3:15 pm - we spotted a Minke whale mid-Admiralty Inlet
, 1 mile south of Bush Pt, Whidbey Island. First headed NW then SE. Have not been able to spot the orcas yet, so they must be stalled out, lost in the "Possession Triangle" or headed up Possession Sound. -Susan Berta & Howard Garrett, Orca Network
