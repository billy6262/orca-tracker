Orca Sightings for May 31, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
We haven't seen
J Pod
much this spring so it was extra special having them
rolling around in Open Bay this afternoon
. This is
J31
Tsuchi doing her flying lessons. Tsuchi is a 22-year-old female and her siblings are J27 Blackberry and J39 Mako. -Photo by Katie Jones

Jpod came down the west side very early this morning
and it looked like they were going to head west. Turns out they decided to come back in and spent a good portion of the day tucked into Open Bay on the Northwest side of San Juan Island, seemingly waiting out the strong ebb current that was happening. Lots of socializing going on with some spyhops, and then they woke up and started breaching and tail slapping. We saw so many different orca behaviors it was amazing! What a fantastic encounter with
Jpod
! This family group
tucked into a place called Open Bay / Kellett Bluff
to seemingly ride out the strong ebb tide that would have carried them south. They were moving rather slowly as they socialized. Rolling on top of one another, sticking noses out of the water. Even vocalizing above the surface! They were also playing with bits of kelp too. A couple times they tried to go around the bluff and head north, but it seemed like the current was not to their liking, so they would tuck back into the bay. Once the tide flipped, they continued on north. Watch til the very end! They get a little more active at the end of the encounter with a couple breaches and surfing too! -Video by Western Prince WW,

They decided to stay! After coming back down from up north early this morning (this shot (below) of
J17 Princess Angeline
was taken
before 7 AM
!),
J-Pod
looked like they were going to go west, but then looped back and went north again. This is more the type of travel pattern we expect from them in the summer, so hopefully they continue to be around on a more regular basis from here on out! -Monika Wieland Shields

Good morning,
J-pod
(and nice to see you too, Tahlequah!). What a lovely detour on the way to town this morning. -Photo by Sara Hysong-Shimazu,

Juan de Fuca - We started off today with reports of
J Pod heading south/west in Haro Strait
but thought we would take some time to check out west of Sooke first and we excited to find the
Transient Killer Whales - T065a and family traveling east from Muir Creek
. We also visited seals, sea lions, elephant seals, sea otter and eagles! -Paul Pudwell, Sooke Coastal WW

Possession Sound - Just saw a pod of
6 - 7 orcas at
5:29 pm, heading north from Howarth Park in Everett
. Going towards navy yard. Awesome action. Sorry but I couldn't get phone out in time. Traveling. Creating water as they went. Multiple times. Appears to be following coastline. -Bryan Hoeck

Humpback
on 5.31.17 @
1130
heading north. Now at
Southworth ferry lane
. Wish I had a real camera, could have shot the breach at the SW point, but mile up and out of my usable photo range. Still a pleasure, but got these shots. -Tim Ferris
