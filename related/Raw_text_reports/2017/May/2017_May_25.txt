Juan de Fuca Strait - Humpbacks
in Canadian waters today... With clear and calm sailing conditions, it was well worth the long haul to
Constance Bank, British Columbia, where we encountered heroic humpback whale MMY0009
trending west against the breathtaking vista of the snow-capped Olympic peninsula. This whale was one of the humpbacks involved in saving a Steller sea lion from the attacking T100 transient orca pod last year. After their intervention, which resulted in the orcas abandoning dinner, the humpbacks escorted the sea-lion away from the scene. Not such a good day for the transients! Shortly after leaving MMY0009 and heading south, another of our favorite humpbacks, believed to be Poptart (sixth calf of Big Mama), kept us company for a while before we headed home after yet another invigorating and memorable cruise. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
