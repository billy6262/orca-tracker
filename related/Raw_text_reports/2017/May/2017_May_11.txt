7:40 p.m. -
Tonight while riding the Amtrak Cascades northbound, I was treated to a glimpse of
a lone male orca between Mukilteo and Everett,
. Seems like it was about the same time and place as the Bigg's/Transients that were spotted on Monday evening. He surfaced twice and then I lost him. What a treat! -Jennifer Tennessen

By

7:00 pm they had made the turn heading southbound towards Mukilteo
with a gorgeous rain squall moving in from the south.

6:45 p.m. - one boy in lead hugging closer to Hat/Gedney
still southeast bound approaching east end of island. Mom is a little more towards mid about 3 minutes behind and other two boys are on Priest Point side of mid channel about 1-2 minutes behind her. All southeast bound steady pace.

6:15 p.m. - they passed between Tulalip Bay
and northside of Hat/Gedney steady pace southeast bound towards Priest Point and Everett.

5:44 p.m. - 1 male just exiting Port Susan
. Southbound mid channel at Camano Head;

5:53 p.m. - female now exiting passing southbound
a bit further west at green channel marker at Camano Head;

5:55 p.m. - 2nd male now passing southbound Camano head
;

5:57 p.m. - 3rd male now passing the channel marker off Camano Head
more east of mid channel

4:45 p.m. - they are south of Kayak Point (to the east) and Sunny Shore Acres (on Camano), together but loosely spread powering southbound in the chop. It's so cold out here! I male in the lead, followed by mom and one son, 3rd male is trailing.

4:25 p.m. - I watched them continue north for about 30 minutes then lost them until now. Thinking they went deep north and maybe west into Port Susan and disappeared on me for about the past hour... they are now southbound about where I last saw them out in middle of the port, mid channel.

2:45 p.m. - on a hunch (in part based on a report they were in here yesterday...) I ventured to Kayak Point Park, Port Susan. I arrived to fairly choppy seas and somehow see big boys dorsals (presuming
T101s
) in the middle out from my location kind of milling at first trending north at the moment! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

11:52 a.m. -
Chilkat Express leaving the
T101s all grouped up now heading north in Possession Sound
toward the ferry lanes. We never saw the other group! Only T101 and her 3 sons. -Justine Buckmaster

11:30 a.m. -
We spotted
two female Orcas (one could have possibly been a calf) near the Mukilteo ferry
. We viewed them from the beach, they came up for air several times then disappeared from sight. The Orca were relatively close to the beach if I were to guess I would saw about 200-300 feet (this distance could be totally wrong). It was low tide at the time of sighting, roughly
11:30 am. Traveling. The two were heading south. -Zoe Denckla
*

11:12 a.m. - 2 Orcas traveling South
at a pretty good clip about
2 miles south of Clinton/ Mukilteo Ferry

ferry crossing south bound. More to the south. -Christopher Hanke
