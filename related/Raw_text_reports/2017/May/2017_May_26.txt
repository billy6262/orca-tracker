A report was called in of
6 orcas in the Vashon ferry lanes, at
4:40 pm
, between the Fauntleroy dock and the Vashon ferry landing. (
They said the orcas weren't headed anywhere, and were just "drifting", which makes us wonder if they were actually rafting sea lions. Sea lions at rest, drifting with their flippers extended straight up above the water, often mistaken for dorsal fins. It seems we would have had other reports by now if there were a pod of orcas in that area on this sunny day - SB
