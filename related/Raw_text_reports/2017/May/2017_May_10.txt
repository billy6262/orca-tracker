Sidney, BC -
1PM Trip
with Captain Gary: Whales right on our doorstep! We enjoyed a beautiful afternoon with the
T018's, a family of four Biggs killer whales
. We saw them have two successful hunts and had a big syphon from this huge boy,
T019B
"Galiano". -Ocean Eco-Ventures WW,
Cowichan Bay

11:30 a.m. - Orcas off Sidney, BC
I saw
at least 4 orcas
(a male and 3 smaller dorsal fins). They were heading North and clearly visible from land. I watched them for about 5 minutes from inside the Ocean Discovery Centre. They were visible only by their fins, no jumps. The orcas in the pod seemed to come up and breathe all at the same time, or very close to the same time. From time to time, they would dissapear for about 45 seconds to 1 minute and then were up again. They appeared to be feeding on seals or Sea Lions for there was water movement, turmoil about 2-3 meters in front of them (the sea was calm). (

including a young one next to mom. Very far away, almost to Camano... It is extremely rare to see Orcas in Port Susan...-Photo by Gary Lingenfelter

Unidentified whales - Harley and I disagree about what but we saw a cetacean about 10-15 minutes ago (

3:20-
3:25
). I saw the blow and saw one orca come up. Out of the water-totally unexpected! We turned engine off man hour ago and have been drifting with current and just main up. Wow! Got my adrenaline going! We've been watching but haven't seen anything since. Harley thinks it was a humpback but he didn't see as much as I did...where we are-
south of Possession Point
midchannel. Both sails up now and we are heading back north. -Sharon Ann Clark

On the

3:00 crossing from Mukilteo
- soon after M/V Kittitas was under way several people exclaimed "whale!" I, of course, was scanning the opposite side of the vessel. I spoke with a young man who distinctly described the fluking of a baleen whale. He did not see the back. Location was
just north of ferry lanes
. Possession is glassy and it's beautiful out there so anyone on this crossing the remainder of the day should be on the sun deck! -Debbie Stewart

10:54 a.m. - 53 and 383 just west of possession point with another further east
of us near bouy. No direction. Just logging and hanging out. -Renee Beitzel
