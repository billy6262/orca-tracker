re
6:25 post- Wondering if that's a separate group. The ones I watched hugged the Mukilteo side south bound at least 1mi from mukilteo beach when I last saw them at around
16:45. Two adult males, two adult females, and 1-2 calves.- Ariel Yseth

, are heading south on the Mukilteo side past the lighthouse. -Photo by Ariel Yseth,

Entry 2:

Female and calf.
The surf was rolling in heavy while I was kayaking and something caught the corner of my eye. I thought it must've been a black seabird of some sort diving or a harbor porpoise because I couldn't quite see over the waves. I gave up kayaking about 10 seconds later. And once I hauled my kayak up on shore I turned and mom and calf were straight out from where I just was. Realized mama's fin caught my eye then I glanced and must've seen the little one going under. -Photo by Ariel Yseth,

I am sitting on my front deck listening to and watching a group of 4-6 porpoise about 30' off our low tide shoreline and have spotted

Browns Point, Tacoma
this evening and we saw what we thought was
a single small whale

After speaking with Diana based on what was seen and behaviors sounds
most likely to be a small humpback

THAR SHE BLOWS!!!! We're sitting on our north-facing deck and it's

5:57pm
. We just heard the WHALE BELL a few minutes ago, and now we hear the distinct sounds of the blows of a whale/s close to shore across the street from 417 First St. Simon said he saw it, but I just hear it repeatedly. Wonderful sounds! A healthy
WHALE feeding right here in downtown LANGLEY
! Robin (Black Callison) & Tim (Mayor Callison) tell us there were TWO feeding whales, and I estimate they hung around 30-45/ minutes at least. Guests at the INN AT LANGLEY had front row seats to this wildlife excitement! -Sharen Heath
