Orca Sightings for May 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Southern Residents - "...Ken departed Snug Harbor at 1037 in "Chimo" and immediately encountered
J36 and J37 off Mitchell Bay
heading southeast very spread apart and taking long dives. Other individual whales were off at great distance and some were ahead, also
heading down Haro Strait
but they were too far away to identify and not surfacing often..." -See full summary and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter #34

J36 Alki and her son J52 Sonic this morning off Lime Kiln
. We saw members of
all matrilines from LK

all of Js and L87
that came back down. All mixed up though with J16s at beginning middle and end. Photo by Monika Wieland Shields

In case no one else has reported this, I've positively identified the
gray whale seen on
May 13 east of Race Rocks, Juan de Fuca as #53 (Little Patch)
, heading west with purpose. Has had enough of Puget Sound, I guess, and has places to go! -Photo by Val Shore
