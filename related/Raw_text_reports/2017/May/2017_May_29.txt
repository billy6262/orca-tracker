...Dave arrived on scene about
mid-Boundary Pass a little north of Sandy Point on Waldron Island at 1715
. The whales were traveling south fairly quickly and spread out in three or four tight groups.
T77A and T87
were traveling together about a half mile to the northwest of the
T86As, T124Ds, and T124A1. The rest of the T124As and the T100s (minus the T100Bs who were not present) were a little further to the southeast of this group
...-See full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 39

T124A's, T124D's, T86A's, T77A, T87, T100's - By our count 21 transient killer whales
traveling fast against a flood tide all the way
from Java Rocks to Cattle Pass
. Just amazing the level of power to travel at speed against a 4 knot current. Why? Because they can. We all passed Friday Harbor and cleared Turn Island at sunset. See full report and photos on ABS blog HERE. -Barbara and David Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
