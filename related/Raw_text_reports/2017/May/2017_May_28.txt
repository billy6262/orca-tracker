Orca Sightings for May 28, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
After Jane Cogan called Dave at home in the early evening to report that she was hearing
J pod calls on the Lime Kiln hydrophone
, Dave, Giles, and Collette met down at Snug Harbor and left in the boat at about 1930. We arrived on scene off the
south end of Kellett Bluff at 1938. J pod and L87 were in a resting formation
with all the whales being in one tight group moving very slowly north with the tide. We left the whales heading north up Haro Strait off north Kellett Bluff at 2008 still in one tight slow moving group. All members of J pod and L87 were photographed. See full report details and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 38.

Ask and ye shall receive - our patience was rewarded this evening when
all of J-Pod

20:45

Early evening off San Juan Island in Haro Strait: Jpod
just blew on past! Major flood going on and that clearly gave them quite the push! Hopefully, there are salmon here. I have to keep up the hope. -Photo by Traci Walter

Victoria Water Front there was reports of Transient Killer Whales

earlier.

A fresh breeze, brilliant sunshine, blue seas and skies greeted passengers and crew of Mystic Sea as we headed through the islands towards Canada to spend time with transient orcas. The
T101s and T102
were traveling in leisurely fashion off
Cordova Bay, near Victoria, B.C
., initially fairly well spread out before grouping up with no apparent lunch stops along the way. Once again another day of wonderful wildlife and scenery was enjoyed by all. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
