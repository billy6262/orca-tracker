Orca Sightings for May 27, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - We saw
a pod of 4, by west side Whidbey island, around 4pm
. We came out of Friday Harbor, towards Port Townsend. Whidbey was on our left and the 4 were hunting there. We saw some pretty great celebratory action from them. -Crystal Ediger

2:20 p.m. - Orcas just south of Deception Pass
right now! Their about 400 yards from shore. Heading south. -Photo by Tammy Bretches,

Entry 2:

12:20 p.m. - Friday Harbor/Anacortes Ferry: Group of 3 Orcas off Anacortes in Rosario Strait
. Large male, female, and a juvenile. Likely transients. -Skookum Galarza
*

12:15 p.m. - 5 orcas
seen from the ferry. 2 males in a group of 4 and one male traveling outside the group just ahead of the group. Passed behind the ferry moving fast. Beautiful! I was on the
ferry Fri Harbor to Anacortes
but it left 20 minutes late. I saw the orcas behind the ferry as we approached Anacortes. I was on the outside "back" of the ferry looking to the NW. They swam past the ferry wake heading south. -Michelline Halliday

Just had a report from the ferry of
a humpback ~1/4 mile NE of us on Fort Casey side
. Not picked it up yet (suspect it is round the corner from us). Will let you know when we pick it up. No playbacks today. -Cheers Frankie Robertson

Case Inlet -
7:08 p.m. -
Appears to be feeding directly across from the north point of
Harstine Island
, along the mainland. Single boat watching from distance - lucky.

6:38 p.m. - Single humpback heading north between Herron and Stretch Island in Case Inlet
. Watched him surface about 10 times or so across from Harstine Point / Chesapeake beach. Too far out for pics. -Miche Ennis

7:30 a.m. - Humpback is in Case Inlet, Spencer Cove
. Has been traveling north and south between the Cove and HARSTINE Point all morning.
Was also doing the same yesterday (Friday) between
3:00 and
8:00pm
. Saw approx 8 full breaches (completely out of water) and 3 partial ones. Saw possible bubble netting this morning. -Jerilyn Evans

6:41 p.m -
There's been a whale spraying for last hour and a half North Puget Sound
between Point No Point and Whidbey Island
. Not sure if it's circling or feeding or what but seems to stay around the same area kind of in the center of the two. Viewing from edmonds in the far off distance, with and without binoculars. (
both humpbacks and a gray whale have been seen in this area - ALB
) -AnaLisa Gerbig

Pod of dolphins in Case Inlet. About 10 animals
milling around south end of Case Inlet. -James Lewis
*
Harbor porpoise - Porpoises in Shilshole Bay
. I saw several (approx 4-6?) harbor porpoises in Shilshole Bay while running along the North Beach of Discovery Park this morning around
7:30 am. I watched one surface quite close to the beach, perhaps 100-200 feet away, and could hear it expel air. My first sighting - thrilling! Feeding I think. -Kate Criss
