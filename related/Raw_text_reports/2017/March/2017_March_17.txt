, headed south.... Approaching nav marker opposite West Point. (Discovery Park) Too far to determine number or ecotype. -Sandra Prow

9:30 a.m. - Coastal Orca Sighting, Yaquina Head, Oregon. A pod of approximately 10 orcas was spotted 1 mi north of Yaquina Head
near Newport, Oregon and approximately .75 mi off the coast. Small flotillas of sea lions were seen gathering hurriedly into one large flotilla of approximately 200 sea lions in shallower water nearer the beach, presumably in an attempt to evade the orcas. The orcas were observed from
9:30am to
10:00am first nearer shore and then moving further out to about 1.5 to 2 mi. 3-4 adult males and 5-6 smaller whales were observed. Feeding. -Amy Summerfelt

Budd Inlet, South Puget Sound - Spotted a pod of Common dolphins
(after some investigating) in Budd Bay yesterday (17 Mar) about

10:30AM
. They were in mid-bay, headed south past the old DNR dock when we first sighted them and lost them when they were about even with the south end of Priest Point Park. Looked to be around 6 individuals and they were actively broaching, both singly and in groups of two or three. My view point is on the slope above Big Tykle Cove on the Cooper Point peninsula. -Tom Bigley
