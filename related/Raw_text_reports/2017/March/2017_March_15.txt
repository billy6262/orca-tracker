Just this morning we were reminiscing about how two years ago today we saw
Humpback BCY0324 Big Mama
and lo and behold, we
found her up near East Point today
! One of our sharp-eyed passengers first spotted her and it wasn't long before we got some good looks at her and recognized that familiar fluke. It sure was wonderful seeing her! Big Mama was one of, if not THE, first humpback to return to the Salish Sea after whalers extirpated the species from our waters during the 1900s.
Since being first spotted she has brought back at least six calves, the most recent being last summer
. Perhaps next year when she returns she'll have another new baby with her! We also saw tons of other wildlife, including harbor porpoises, harbor seals, Steller sea lions, and a peregrine falcon! It was a wildlife-packed day for sure! -Sara Hysong-Shimazu, Maya's Legacy WW

Unidentified whales -
We just received a whale report from Connie Barrett on Camano Island - at
6 pm they saw a large whale spout between Baby Island and Whidbey Island (No.Bluff/Greenbank area)
. (This is one of the North Puget "Sounders" shrimp beaches where the Gray whales are known to feed, so we expect it is one of our local Grays)
