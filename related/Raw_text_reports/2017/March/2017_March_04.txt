Orca Sightings for March 4, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
J pod slowly pass San Juan Island
. This video was taken from shore at Lime Kiln State Park on San Juan Island, Washington State. It was a bit of a crisp day as these orcas slowly moved against an ebb tide. -Traci Walter

Trip report: Snow was falling this morning when we got the first reports of whales in the area and by the time we left the dock the snow had stopped and patches of blue sky were visible. It was a welcome sight, though not nearly as welcome as what was to come--- we were soon on scene with
J-pod and L87
! It sure was nice to see those familiar dorsal fins again. The pod was spread out into several groups and were down on long dives but we were able to spend some time with several familiar friends, including
Oreo (J22) and her teenage son, Cookie (J38), Onyx (L87), and Blackberry (J27) with his siblings, Hy'shqa (J37) and her son T'ilem Inges (J49)
. We hope they're finding enough salmon to eat and while we wait for more encounters with them over the coming weeks and months we strive to make changes on our end to ensure these whales have enough food to eat in the future. -Sara Hysong- Shimazu, Naturalist, Maya's Legacy WW
Note: J37 lost both her mom J14 Samish and her great-grandmother J2 Granny within months of one another this past year, J49 his grandmother and great-great-grandmother. J49 is now 5 years-old and will travel by his mom's side the remainder of their lives. Oreo (J22), who lost her son J34 Doublestuf just over 2 months ago, northbound Haro Strait today with the rest of J pod (including her surviving son J38) and L87. It was so wonderful to be reunited with Jpod yesterday and even better finding that Onyx (L87) was still with them. This boy is such a survivor and I know many people have been thinking of him since the loss of Granny. Here he is with San Juan Island in the background.

Hearing faint
J pod calls on OrcaSound hydrophone

Haro Strait
this afternoon. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

This afternoon we saw a very spread out
J-Pod slowly head north past Lime Kiln between 2 and 4 PM
. They were doing very long dives and were mostly backlit, but it looked like all family groups were accounted for, plus L87 as well! -Monika Wielands-Shields

this morning. -Mark Malleson

3:09 p.m. -
We watched
Patch
(gray whale) move steady southbound as he
passed Camano neighborhoods of Sunny Shore Acres and last saw him surface between Tyee Beach, Camano and Spee-Bi-Dah on the mainland
. He was still on steady southbound course when we left.

1:55 pm -
Sweet! past few minutes my sister and I have been seeing blows and body of #49 moving southbound just west of mid channel in Port Susan between the Bretland neighborhood, Camano Island and our perch at Kayak Point Regional park across the water. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network and Annie Kondra

Today was our first gray whale watch trip for the 2017 season - it's so good to be back out on the water - on such a beautiful (but cold) day - and finding
#49 Patch in Port Susan
! -Jill Hein,

Fred Lundahl reports

From

3:00 -
4:00 p.m. -
while watching Gray whale #49 blowing and surfacing in the distance we saw at least
a couple dozen Harbor porpoise spread across Port Susan
traveling back and forth in groups of 4-8. Waters were calm and watching their triangular dorsals skim the surface in every direction near and far in their signature way was really cool. So great to see the abundance of them in most areas of Puget Sound these days. -Alisa Lemire Brooks and Annie Kondra (The sisters)
