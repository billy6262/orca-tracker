============================================================

... The whales were traveling slowly and spread out in small groups with some singles
across San Juan Channel
. The first whales "Orcinus" encountered were the
J16s minus the J36s
and they were in a loose group about mid-channel. There were small groups and individuals both to north and the south of the J16s. The J16s briefly pointed southwest as the whales south of them converged a little. As the J16s moved slowly on, J27 and J31 (who were the southernmost whales) and another pair,
J40 and J45
, passed by on either side the boat. The J16s had actually dropped back some and, after another brief look at them, "Orcinus" moved on to a pair of whales several hundred yards to the northeast. This was
J39 and J46
and they may have been chasing a fish together as there were several tight turns and J46 did a bunch of tail lobs. These two moved toward and joined several other whales several hundred more yards to the northeast. The whales they joined were
L87, J35, J47, and J44
and this group seemed to be socializing.... See full encounter summary report/photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 23

Entry 2:

The J16s and J19s - San Juan Channel.
Seemed like the first day of Spring and we sailed downwind wing on wing to Flattop Island only to hear
J pod showed up out of the blue into Friday Harbor
. We doubled back pronto and spent a glorious
afternoon
drifting back to Flattop with lazy cavorting whales. Vocalizations and echolocations on our hydrophone drew a picture of their world that we fell into.
J38 Cookie
was energetically chasing fish north of Jones Island.
L87 Onyx is still a part of the J pod family
. Spread wide across the San Juan Channel - who would choose Presidents, Spieden, or North? Who is making the decisions without J2 Granny? We left them at Flattop headed towards Waldron Island at sunset. -Barbara and David, All Aboard Sailing

3:37 p.m. - Orcas
traveling east in the Straight of Georgia off Mayne island just now, spread out and moving quickly.
At least 2 big males, 10 or so females and a baby
....they were quite far out and I was viewing from the shore with binoculars. Trending southerly for sure. I'm very lucky to get to see them fairly often from here on Mayne Island. Always so exciting. First sighting of 2017! -Jeff McPherson
(
possibly J pod & L87 who showed up in the San Juans the next day after having been up north- ALB
)

2 grays at the end of the dock at Kayak Point, we watched them about 5-6pm.
We left & they were still hanging around mid channel of Port Susan, but appeared to be headed to Tulalip. Deep dives, could have been feeding. -Nate Trujillo
