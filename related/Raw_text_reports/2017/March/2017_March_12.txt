Orca Sightings for March 12, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were watching them from

2:58 to
3:38 pm
to be precise. They were super spread out in ones and small groups, and very shifty (except for Onyx). Framed by the Olympic Mountains,
Onyx (L87) cruises past us in Juan de Fuca Strait
.
Mako (J39), in front, and Se-Yi'-Chn (J45) travelling eastward.
We were joking they'd been taking transient lessons. We'd line up to be on their beam and then they would do a long dive and come up in a different direction. This happened repeatedly.
We saw L87, J38, J39, J47, J45, J35 and a few others I couldn't ID
because they were being so shifty. Their general direction was east at that point, but in a zigzaggy way. We heard J27 was further west and there were other individuals we saw off in the distance. I guess Maya had the J16s further to the east. It was a challenging day for getting ID shots. Seems to be the norm these days, sadly. I was just mentioning to passengers that the several times I've seen Js this winter I've never seen them grouped up. -Val Shore

both trips.
Strait of Juan de Fuca, south of Victoria
. They were heard on the hydrophones, but no one could find them. They had either gone south or north. I choose north. It was the right choice. I left them headed back towards San Juan Island, near Discovery Is., at

Entry 3:
*

4:06 p.m. - Blows (Gray whales)
spotted mid-channel south of the
county park by Camano Country Club
area. Not sure if north or south bound. -Shelly Greybeck
*

2:50 pm -
those 2 beauties still milling around
north Port Susan
, mid channel north of Kayak Point, traveling around the same general area probably feeding. Now I leave. (Thanks to Renee Beitzel for confirming with me that #56 was 2nd whale)

2:00 p.m. - #49 & #56 continued north and are currently pretty deep into Port Susan
.

1:00 p.m. - watching Gray whale #49 Patch and #56 traveling northbound mid channel in Port Susan
out from Kayak Point Regional Park. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*
Saratoga grays #49 (Patch) and #56 traveling together
just like yesterday... We encountered both whales
near Port Susan
making a number of directional changes, keeping passengers, captain and crew on their toes. Weather conditions were favorable for spotting those mighty blows and rolling backs, though tail flukes were more elusive with no deep dives observed. Good to see two of our regulars back in one of their favorite feeding spots. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist.
