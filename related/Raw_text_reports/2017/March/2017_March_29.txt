Orca Sightings for March 29, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
After a lengthy search we caught up with most of
J pod (everyone minus the J17's and L87) near Point Lawrence on the east side of Orcas Island this afternoon
. They were foraging quite a bit doing lengthy dives and moving erratically in a foraging fashion. Typical March day where the weather changes every 5 minutes, but beautiful none the less. We don't really know what happened after we left. They were sloooooowly coming down past
Pea Pod rocks in Rosario
. That's the last we knew. I think we were the only ones out there in the afternoon. I think we left them around
2:30ish? -Traci Walter

Three Grey Whales were feeding at Polnell point
just before sunset this evening. They were about 25-50 yards off shore. -Jeff Humphrey

Polnell Point
. Last seen off the tip of Polnell Point, destination unknown, -Steve Rothboeck
