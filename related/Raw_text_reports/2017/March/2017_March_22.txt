Orca Sightings for March 22, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
T125A
powering southbound in
central Puget Sound
on this beautiful blustery Pacific Northwest day. He and his brother
T128
spent a few days inland Puget Sound before exiting
Admiralty Inlet on the 24th
. -Justine Buckmaster

Today was another amazing Gray Whale Excursion on the San Juan Clipper. We had a special charter today for a couple of school groups. We met up with
3 Gray Whales in Port Susan, including #53 and #56
! Then, after our stop in Langley, we were treated to an encounter with
Transient Killer Whales T125A and T128
. Even though it was a bit choppy out and it rained on and off, that wasn't enough to stop us from viewing amazing wildlife! -Justine Buckmaster

Just saw them again ... 2 different Orcas but dorsals only. Looks like they are continuing to move slowly south in mid-channel. -Tim Cuddy

San Juan Clipper left
2 males south of Jeff Head

oil tanks. (sightline)

3:20 p.m. - I saw a couple dorsals
from the northeast corner of
Bainbridge Island
. The sea is starting to calm down a bit now but it is still pretty rough out there and hard to spot Orcas in mid-channel. -Tim Cuddy
*

3:20 p.m. -
I see male dorsal fins...sightline
from Carkeek out from northern 1/3 Port Madison
. Still southbound. Near the Clipper. Very Windy and choppy seas! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

1:59 p.m. -
Have gone down now..midchannel last spotted straight out from dock.. perhaps south of yellow channel marker now. 4-5 of them. At least one male and a few females.. too far out to Identify or photograph

on Westside of Sidney Foss tugboat..
Kingston heading south
. -Sue Larkin

1:05 p.m. - They just passed Apple Tree Point

11:00 am -
Puget Sound Express with
Killer whales southbound at Point no Point
, Puget Sound. -Peter Hanke
*

1:15 p.m. - Port Susan - At least 2 continued traveling south
brisk pace. Now seeing one back north closer to me at the park again, not sure if they turned and came back north or if this is the 3rd whale off the point south of Kayak Point (McKees).

12:38 p.m. - still steady southbound south of Kayak Point Park
, they have moved further offshore, but still this side to mid channel. Very windy and choppy seas.

12:15 p.m. - I have been watching Gray whales in north Port Susan
...north of Kayak Point Park. I arrived about noon and could see blows to the north and a couple of heads surfacing. Pretty quickly they are on the move, they are currently moving southbound at good clip off shore of the park looks like 53 is one. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

11:30 -
Justine Buckmaster is on the Clipper with
three gray whales in Port Susan
, and none of them are #49 Patch, so there must be four grays in Saratoga Passage and Possession Sound, at least. -Justine Buckmaster
*
Gray #49
circled back around. Here he is
under the bluffs between Baby Island and Fox Spit
. -Marilyn Armbruster

5:43 p.m. - He, #49, is now between Baby Island and Greenbank Farm
. Trending southerly towards entrance to Holmes Harbor.

4:30 p.m. -
It's coming back towards
baby island
again. I want to say it's like 1/4 channel out Whidbey side and moving closer to Baby Island. I'm heading down to our dock right now

4:00 p.m. - Gray heading southeast just south of Baby Island towards Fox Spit
again.

1:45 p.m. - whale just south of Baby Island
, too close to shore for me take photos from top of bluff. It's feeding. -Marilyn Armbruster
*

4:53 p.m. -
Here watching from
Baby Island
, very short up times. I'm barely even seeing the whale, just the blow. -Emily Wandres
*
Nancy Nolan also posted a report of the
Gray heading towards Baby Island at

4:35
- saying it was spending time underwater, likely feeding ~
*
At
0910 this morning my neighbor advised that a gray whale is located about 100 yards east of Polnell point on the east side of Whidbey Island
. -Steve Rothboeck
*
Today I got a report if a possible
Humpback
in my area. The Boy, Dog and I packed a lunch and went to investigate. We saw the Humpback come up one time (about
11:15 a.m. ) as we got out of the car, didn't even have my camera out yet. We waited a few hr, went for a walk and sat (in the car) through 3 wind/rain storms with sun breaks. Sadly we didn't see the whale again, it seemed to be going somewhere fast. -Desiree Sauve
*
I had a friend post on my feed that there was a
Humpback at Dalco Passage viewpoint, around
10:30am
. -Melissa Bird, ON volunteer

Sighting around

9:10-
9:20
(Posted
9:39 a.m.) - Fairly certain there is a whale around
Commencement Bay 20-30 minutes
ago....
Close to shore by Old Town Tacoma
. It looked like it was moving into the bay. Haven't been able to see it since. Couldn't get a total confirmation on species, looked as though it did have a small dorsal. -Caitlyn Cowan
*
Around

3:45 p.m. -
my son saw
a whale
while riding the school bus, looking into the bay
(Commencement) from Browns Point
. He thought it was an orca... near Browns Point lighthouse, mid bay. -Jessica Eva Hauser (
There was a
humpback
in the area earlier that morning - ALB
