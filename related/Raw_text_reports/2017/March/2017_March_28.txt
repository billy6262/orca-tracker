Orca Sightings for March 28, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
We found gray whales # 21, 22, and 383 milling around in Saratoga Passage just south of Penn Cove
.It looks like 383 has a new scrape on his right side. -Bart Rulon, Naturalist, PS Express
*

12:40 p.m. - Those two gray whales - mid Saratoga Passage
, are now slowly trending SE
towards Camano Island (Cama Beach State Park)
. Still difficult to see between white-caps....pretty much now out of sight for me. Good luck!

12:10 p.m. -
I just watched some
gray whale blows
from my deck, Saratoga Passage, heading southbound, almost across from Race Lagoon now. Very difficult to see with so many white-caps. Island Adventures is now with them (2?), Chilkat just left. -Jill Hein
*

11:35 a.m. - watching multiple blows mid channel just south of Penn Cove
. Whale boat observing. -Krista Paulino
*
Female juvenile humpack whale was found deceased on Anderson Island, just west of Thompson Cove
