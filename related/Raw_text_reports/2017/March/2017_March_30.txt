After all the months of foul weather we finally opened our Lifeforce Ocean Friends studies. And what a wonderful beginning with
6 orcas that included both 4 month and 7 month young babies. We were off the Powell River
Mill as they foraged and played for over 1.5 hours slowly heading south. We saw breaches, head views, back flips, tail fluke slaps, and lots more.
These Transient orcas were T087, T124C, and T124As (the 2 moms and 2 babies)

Coastal killer whales - A week ago (03/30/2017) my girlfriend and I moved in as the managers of The Bullman Beach Resort. On our second morning here we sighted a pod of
at least five orcas about 200 yards off Bullman Beach
. One male/the rest were female/immature. The pod seemed to be slowly circling but generally maintaining a NW course. Perhaps feeding, circling, but nothing aggressive. At the same time, and maybe 100 yards south of the pod, we saw maybe two small whales - Minke's perhaps, though they stayed low in the water. -Scott Hartman
*

4:26 p.m. At the Saratoga Inn (Langley)watching two whales
surface blow air. In between Camano and Langley moving north. Fun to watch! They don't seem to be orcas, more slow moving and only surfacing a little. -Tiffani Bettis

We have been watching from the Navy Exchange parking lot for about 30 minutes and it's moving along slowly. I took a screenshot of the map and marked with red dots the places where we saw the spray. (Southeast bound towards Polnell Point), -Krista McVay Lee
*

8:27 a.m. - One gray whale spotted in Crescent Harbor
right now. They seem to be foraging. I think it's only one. In the 30 minutes I observed it, it was traveling further in towards the Navy Exchange seawall. Longest underwater period was about 2 minutes, shortest was about 20 seconds. I initially thought it was two, which is what I told Gretchen Shea. Very cool sighting, one of the coolest ways to call in late! -Scott Shea

1-2 gray whales Crescent Harbor
(Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island).
