This
gray was in front of Kayak Point
earlier today (see photo below of gray
#49 Patch
). It was around

1:00pm
, he was traveling north past Kayak Point Park, apparently not feeding, took a left turn and headed west toward Camano Island. That's when I got the fluke shot. Also, two grays were here Tuesday evening (2/28). -Gary Lingenfelter
