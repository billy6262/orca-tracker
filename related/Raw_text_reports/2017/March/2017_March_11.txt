The
2nd "Sounder" is back
!! We started out with challenging conditions but it all improved - specially when whales were sighted! We were happy to again see #49 Patch, and the
2nd of the "Sounders" to arrive - #56!
They were traveling together, first sighted south of Camano Head and we watched them as they traveled southbound along the
west side of Hat/Gedney Island
, close to shore. These whales arrive very hungry, having not eaten for 3-4 months. They'll stay in Possession Sound/Saratoga Passage for ~2 months, feasting on mud shrimp and ghost shrimp, before heading further north. A great start to our 2nd week back on the water. -Jill Hein - volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea (photos below)

Our first day of the 2017 season was a success! We caught up with gray whale
#49 "Patch" just southeast of Gedney Island
where he was
traveling with #56
. These are the
first two of our well known Saratoga Grays
to arrive and soon they will be joined by 9-10 others as they leave their winter breeding grounds in Mexico and make their migration north to Alaska for the summer! -Renee Beitzel, Naturalist
