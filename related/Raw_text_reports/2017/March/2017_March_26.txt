Saratoga Passage - North Puget Sound Gray Whale #49 "Patch"
was seen traveling northbound in Saratoga Passage this morning. From the bluffs
at Baby Island
we watched him steadily make his way northbound towards and eventually
across the entrance to Holmes Harbor to the Hidden Beach area
. He appeared to be keeping to that side so we drove over to Hidden Beach and found him around
2:30 p.m. northbound several hundred yards off shore. Within minutes he stalled and began rolling on his side to feed offshore just to the north off us. (pec and fluke fins above surface gliding through rough seas) He eventually moved closer to shore. We watched him for about 2 hours before we needed to leave and left him still feeding in the shallows nestled below the steep bluff.
Another beautiful day with
a gray whale
. Here is video filmed from shore of North Puget Sound
gray whale #49 "Patch"
feeding in the shallows off Hidden Beach, Whidbey Island. So cool watching the relationship with seabirds who take advantage of the food he stirs up while feeding in the intertidal zone for ghost shrimp and other little creatures. Just one of those wonderful reminders we are all connected in some way! -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network,

It was a short trip from Langley Marina today to meet up with one of our all time favorite Saratoga gray whales,
Patch (#49) off Fox Spit, heading north
. Patch is sporting a few more clusters of orange whale lice on his massive flukes, which he displayed as he took some deep dives and kept everyone guessing as to where he might surface next. California sea-lions frolicking off Langley, some busy harbor porpoise and regal eagles were part of our wildlife trip, with a smattering of sunshine and blue sky breaking through to raise everyone's spirits after a damp start. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist

South Puget Sound - I spotted the
Whale in front of Thompson Cove on Anderson Island at about 9AM Sunday morning
. I thought it was a log for several minutes because it was not moving just bobbing in the small wind waves. It was not until it exhaled that I knew it was a whale... Pete Topping, WDFW
*

11:45 a.m. - central Puget Sound -
"We just saw some vigorous tail slapping off Vashon Island. Not sure what type of whale." (Fauntleroy/ Vashon run) When asked for more detail: "I clearly saw the tail coming out of the water and slapping down again and again. From what I've seen on other occasions
I'd guess it was a humpback
. But I didn't think they were back yet. I saw it right when we were about to dock, a bit North of the dock, and quite a bit away from it." -Sandra Newby
