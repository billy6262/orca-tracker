Saratoga Passage... Continuing north to Baby Island
, a few of our sharp-eyed passengers found
a gray whale exiting Holmes Harbor
. It was
Gray Whale #356
! We thought we saw him a couple of days ago, but he was being shy that day and we couldn't quite confirm. Glad to see him back for another season! He turned and made his way south in Saratoga Passage allowing us to spend some quality time with him. -Excerpt from Island Adventures Blog

"Spouting News" - Spring Spouted Monday

. First a tail, then a spout. Then, another spout =
2 grays REALLY close to shore feeding on ghost shrimp
. Not done yet.
Another
, in mid channel between Utsalady/Mariners' Cove steaming into Skagit Bay with unusually high smokestack spouts. Seeing
3 whales
(other than orcas) at same time in this area a first.
Assumed, mid channel was also a gray but wonder if any possibility of humpback??
Due to higher/more gusto spouts. Shoreline grays fed for over an hour out front until dusk/dark. -Robert Stonefelt, Oak Harbor
