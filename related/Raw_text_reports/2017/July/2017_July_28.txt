Orca Sightings for July 28, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Unidentified killer whales - Sighted Orca Whales on the
west side of Camano Island
(heading south toward Camano Head) from
Bells Beach, Whidbey Island.
Feeding. Playing moving fast. (After some inquiry) - I can't positively say that the whales I spotted were Orca Whales. My neighbors and I spotted the whales swimming fast, thrashing and cutting through the water like they were manuvering in on fish. The distance between us and the whales made it difficult to see them clearly. I am fairly certain there was more than one whale. My neighbor Francia says that she positively black and white whales leaping out of the water...-Best Regards, Joe Wolcott

Entry 2:
Orca in Carr Inlet approximately
3:00PM
(WDFW was out and confirmed presence of humpback and saw no orcas- ALB) -Christopher Hanke
*

Entry 3:
Partridge Bank and Eastern Bank. As we watched the first humpback
, we could see it "shark finning", gliding under the water with just the dorsal fin showing! The second one was a bit far away, but at least he/she did a nice straight-on fluke up! Seals are adorable, as always! (Partridge Bank approx 3-4 kn miles south of Smith Island 3-4 west of Whidbey. Eastern Bank approx 5 kn miles SW of Smith Island). Humpback BCYUnknown "Scratchy" - Eastern Juan de Fuca. -Bonnie Gretz

Entry 4:
7:45 p.m. - Humpback swimming north in Saratoga Passage off Mabana area on Camano Island
. Continous Multiple breachings. -Kathryn Wallace

Thanks to a sharp eyed neighbor, I had a chance to see my first ever
humpback on Camano
. What a show: almost continuous lunge feeding, occasionally highlighted by pec slaps,and a breach or 2 or 3. It was a ways off our bluff
south of Mabana
, heading north and west toward Whidbey. The neighborhood watched for over half and hour, around

7:30 PM
. -Barbara Brock

Posted
10:00 a.m. - I think I saw this
humpback feeding off of Harrington Lagoon
, Whidbey Island!! So cool. -Christine Sandgren Hendry
*

Entry 5:
humpback.. Henderson Bay about 8 pm
. -Anna Frier
*

5:55 p.m. - Currently in Carr Inlet
heading north. Lots of fun breaches to watch. Started in mid-channel which was great for me on the east side, but it headed to west side which meant it got too far out of sight for me. -Sarah Richey Guenther

Dyanna Lambourn, WDFW was on the water and encountered the
humpback in Carr Inlet
interacting with some crab gear. The whale was not entangled as some had thought/reported. -Photo by Dyanna Lambourn, WDFW,

Entry 6:

July 28 - Case Inlet, South Puget Sound - After reading the reports, we couldn't resist heading out to see if we could get fluke shots. We found them
just south of Harstine Island bridge
, as one came up just on the other side of a boat that was watching for them. We stayed with them down to Hope Island. We did manage to get fluke shots of both of them, though with the shallow water, they weren't showing that well. Neither one of them was the same whale we've been seeing in Carr Inlet for the last few weeks.All the boaters following the whales were trying to keep the required distance, which was really nice to see. -Dave Anderson, Cascadia Research Collective
*
Passed under
Harstine Bridge at
7:00ish this evening
. Lots of blowing and two full showings (2 spouts at same time). -Gretchen Stewart

From around

5:50 to
7:10 tonight
, my dad, his friends, and myself took our boat out and followed the
pair of humpback whales south down Pickering Passage
. We first caught up to them across from Geralds Cove, and we left them near the Harstine Island Bridge. (We stayed "Whale Wise" no need to worry.) One of the whales had the dot on its left dorsal fin making me think that it might be the same one that was hanging around down here back in May and June.
Humpback
we've all been calling "Dot" -
Case Inlet
. Taken at
4:16 P.M., from a mile south of Dougall/Harstine Point on the East side of the island.

5:36 p.m. -
They are now heading south down
Pickering Passage
, spotted from the north end of Harstine.

4:06 p.m. - There's two of them
. Just both surfaced
between Herron and Harstine closer to Harstine
. They were heading north quickly, and they were very close to shore. I have pictures of both whales that I can share later. They are now north of Harstine heading north towards the Stretch Island Bridge. -Connor O'Brien
*

3:10 p.m. - Humpback just passed close to McMicken Island
, on east side of
Harstine Island
, slowly heading north in Case Inlet at
3:10pm. Clearly saw its dorsal and fluke, but no pics. -Dave Berliner
