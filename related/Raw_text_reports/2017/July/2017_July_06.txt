Orca Sightings for July 6, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Swanson Channel - With great anticipation due to an early report of
Transient (Bigg's) orcas off Moresby Island (Canada)
, very slowing heading north, we motored up through the San Juan Islands, through the scenic beauty of Pole Pass, on a bright and calm day. With many passengers aboard from out of state, and many who had never seen a whale, we caught up with
T101 (born 1973)
, her two grown sons (
T101A and T101B
), and another large male, at Moresby Island, in the Swanson Channel. They were slowing moving north, with some back and forth and circling, before they turned southwest as we left to find
two gray whales off Bird Rocks
, quite near to Anacortes. Neither of these off season visitors match the identification of our "regular Sounders" gray whales who spend March-May around Whidbey and Camano Islands. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist, Mystic Sea

Puget Sound merge Dyes Inlet group and unidentified pod(s) - We received a message at

8:27 pm
from WA State Ferries Ops, relaying a report from the Ferry Tacoma
on the Bainbridge Island to Seattle run, a pod of ~ 16 orcas
were sighted on the port side of the ferry (which would be north side of ferry lanes). No direction given, but recent reports had them heading north.
*

7:30 to
8:15 p.m.
- watching from Old Creosote on
Bainbridge
. Several whales observed going back and forth, spy hops, tail slaps. They would be in tight groups and then spread out. Too many whales to count as they would quickly move out of the scope. We were able to share and educate some travelers who had just stopped by to take a picture of the ferry as it passed. Stayed with us for about 45 min. What glorious day to live in the PNW and share natures beauty and amazing creatures with others. Thank you, Orca Network for all you do!!! -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn

we left Rockaway on BI.
T's had turned north at Blakely Rock
and were on a steady track west of mid-channel with some tail slapping activity along the way. Such a nice night in an amazing place of beauty! Susan Marie Andersson (Clarification to my report from Rockaway. Chris Merritt and I saw
a group of 5 or 6. There was a second group that came through from Manchester 30 min (

7:30-8pm) behind presumed Dyes group!
Chris and I totally missed that but Kayla Black sent video via text to me.)

7:00 p.m. - Orcas 4-5
of them cruising
South end Bainbridge Restoration point

Entry 2:
East Vashon -
11:30 a.m. -
We spotted
a small pod of Orcas (5) traveling South between Des Moines and Vashon! At Point Robinson
