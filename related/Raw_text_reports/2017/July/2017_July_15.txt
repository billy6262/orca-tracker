Entry 8:
WA Coast - Noon
- Good evening ON, Wanted you to know that my family saw about a
8-12 gray whales just off the shore of Kalaloch Lodge
on Saturday afternoon. Four to six were very close to the breakers, mostly feeding I believe and others were moving in a little further out. I took a few photos if you are interested...no real breaching and I have just one photo of one upper whale tail. Was a treat to see on the Washington Coast. -Sue Larkin
