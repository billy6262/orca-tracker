Orca Sightings for July 25, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
L pod -Juan de Fuca
- ...I decided to turn and head east towards Dungeness in the event that they had stalled out during the night as they had a large flood to contend with. As I was approaching Papa Alpha I received a call that killer whales had been located a couple of miles east of us spread out west bound. A few minutes later we came across
L103 and L123
and could see they were spread out laterally for a mile moving quickly with the building ebb current averaging 7 knots....-See full report and photos at Center for Whale Research Encounter 57.

Entry 2:
J pod - Rosario Strait
- Our evening sail with J pod was much different than our afternoon trip. We heard on the radio that
J pod had been playing with a harbor porpoise
for about an hour. When we arrived they were in a tight group circling with occasional spy hops while pushing around the porpoise on their rostrums.
25 whales in all engaging in this activity
. At some point the whales briefly changed to a straight course followed by several breaches, including
L87
a full grown male repeatedly half breaching. Their behavior changed again by slowly circling/milling with relaxed breaths. It was as if we were watching transient orcas. We heard only a few orca vocalizations on the hydrophone. -Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing

3 BIG members of JPOD "playing with a harbor porpoise", Rosario Strait
(they stayed in one spot for over two hours harassing this porpoise). Ive personally never seen this behavior from the southern residents, it was very interesting watching them. -Photo by Marcie Barney Goldberg,

We left the marina a bit early, and quickly got a report of
orcas near Lummi Island, up Rosario Strait
. It was
J pod
! Such a treat to see residents, and they were very actively fishing, with great bursts of speed, twisting and turning through the water as they chased down those yummy salmon.
All of J pod was reported
, though spread out from Village Point, to Pt. Laurence and the Charlie buoy. We got great looks at
J27 Blackberry
, with his huge dorsal fin and distinctive open saddle patch on his left side, and both
Cookie (J38)
, who at 14 is really starting to sprout a large dorsal fin, and his mom,
Oreo, J22
. We also saw at least two of the young calves born in 2015 as well as
J47 Notch
(now 7 years old), and many others (est. about 20). It was a beautiful, warm day, with glass smooth water and beautiful views of Mt. Baker, and all the lovely small islands in Rosario. A large group of harbor seals and their adorable pups, and at least four bald eagles just enhanced another wonderful wildlife tour on the Salish Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, Volunteer Naturalist, Mystic Sea
