Spent the afternoon in the Salish Sea getting mugged by
2 groups of transient orcas, the T65As and the T49As
.
North of Jones Island time 5-
5:30pm
, literally just going in random circles, mugging our boat a large chunk of the time [of course we weren't moving]. Never seen anything like this, they kept passing by the boat and looking at us for maybe 20 minutes? The crew had also never seen this behavior before from this type of whale. -Carrie Sapp
