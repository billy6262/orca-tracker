Entry 13:
the whale last evening in Carr Inlet off Green Point/Arletta
and now offshore from McNeil Island across from Fox Island. I can hear occasional breathing, and through the binoculars spotted it (two different times) breathing and surfacing about 5 to 7 times then going under showing the very end of the tail. Seems normal. So beautiful to watch. If you know anything about this particular whale I would love to know. Location is in between Gertrude Island and Pitt Passage. I am hearing it again right now (
11:50 a.m.). -Thank you. Erin Dugger Reetz

Entry 14:
Puget Sound - Noon-
12:20 p.m. -
Just now,
humpback
, just southwest of south Vashon and ferry!!! Heading east. We observed
BCX1251 Orion from about noon to
12:20pm
. He was heading east just slightly. He would come up about 3 times for air? and then dive. He continued this pattern the whole time. He turned and headed towards the south end of Vashon for just a very short time. He then turned around back towards the center of the channel. He dove one more time, and when he finally came up he had headed east and had traveled quite a distance. It looked like he kept on that course as we headed the opposite direction. Thank you so much for the Orca Network! We would have never been watching for Orion if I hadn't been able to see the update on the Orca Network!!! Thank you! -Lisa Bond Mize
