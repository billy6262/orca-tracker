Orca Sightings for July 26, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
North Puget Sound -
5:50 p.m. - I saw a Humpback from the lighthouse at Mukilteo
. I saw it breach about 4 times to the west of the park. -Eileen Zayas-Montilla

4:41 p.m. - The Possession Sound humpback
continues to hang around. My friend Trish Sullivan Campbell just reported it
from Mukilteo Beach
heading north across the ferry lanes. Time of this post is

4:41
. I'm at Glendale hoping it heads this way. -Debbie Stewart

Between

4:15 and
4:25 watched a humpback whale first out in front of Mukilteo Lighthouse
crossing ferry lanes heading northeast towards Everett. I took the
3:45 boat (Clinton to Mukilteo) came across and walked to lighthouse and saw it breach. North of ferry terminal. -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 2:
South Puget Sound -
11:00 a.m. - The humpback is in the Carr Inlet
right now. He is in the middle of the inlet
between Fox Island and the Gig Harbor peninsula
with a horse head Bay around the corner. He is staying in the same area. Looks like there's a good food source there. -Dawn Morris

Entry 3:
July 26th Whale Sighting Report). Just saw it at
9 PM just west of Harborview Park in Everett
. -Greg Heiss
*
Approx
6 to 7pm
- I saw it breach, blow and slap its tail numerous times. From Mulkiteo to around the
Sandy Point tip of Whidbey
. -James Grindle

I went whale watching with the San Juan Clipper. While we did not see any orcas, we did eventually find this
humpback whale
around the
southeast end of Patos Island
. We stayed with it from

3:45-
4:15 P.M
. At first it was surfacing at unpredictable locations, with long down times. Around

4:10 it started "mugging" a boat
. This is a picture from when it was doing that. I have a picture of part of it's underside fluke that I can share in the comments in case that will help identify it. Left underside fluke tip of Humpback CS631 "Two Spot" (or CRC-16017). -Connor O'Brien

Gorgeous day on the water this afternoon, with
humpback whale "Two Spot", aka CRC-16017 and CS631 (south of Patos Island)
Then we headed to the T46 matriline of Bigg's killer whales - with the backdrop of Mount Baker. On the Island Explorer 5. -Alisa Schulman-Janiger
