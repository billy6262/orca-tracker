Orca Sightings for July 9, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Sunday,
July 9: Our trip took us into Canadian waters today, where the
T37A transient orcas, accompanied by lone male T51,
were busy tracking down an unsuspecting harbor porpoise for lunch
near Sidney, B.C.
We watched with baited breath as the whales circled their prey, slapping the water with their tails and submerging slowly as they closed in on their victim. Eventually, with some celebratory breaches and spy-hops, they headed in towards the shoreline and continued on their travels in search of the next meal. And talking of meals - as we sailed towards home we were privileged to see a bald eagle returning to the nest to feed her chick. Yet again we enjoyed a taste of nature's dramatic diversity here in the wonderful Pacific Northwest. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist
