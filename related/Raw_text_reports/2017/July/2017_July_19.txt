Orca Sightings for July 19, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
With reports of
Killer Whales around Sooke
traveling west this morning we were excited to get our guests out quickly to sea if what we thought might be
L Pod
...It WAS! They were well spread out and only stopping occasionally for a quick bite.
L83 Moonlight
(born 1990) heads west with her family the
L47s and other members of L pod
- Juan de Fuca Strait. -Paul Pudwell

Coastal killer whales - Orca sighting - Sighted from on the beach
just south of Sand Point, WA, Olympic National Park;
approximately
8pm
on Wednesday,

Entry 2:
several orcas - 5-10?
spouting and surfacing. Looked to be due west of Cape Alava, traveling south 3 to 4 miles offshore. Larger whales appeared to be leading, with several smaller whales in a 2nd group following. -Denis Brasfield

Entry 3:
Salish Sea
....clear skies, warm breeze, fairly calm waters, as we motored between the San Juan Islands, then headed west
through Cattle Pass
. Along the way we stopped to see adorable harbor seal pups and their moms, basking on the rocks. We also saw a bald eagle family, two adults and a dark brown juvenile. As we headed out into Haro Strait, we found
two minke whales
, our smallest baleen whale, feeding off Eastern Bank. Minkes are notorious for being elusive, and these two stayed true to that! We truly are lucky to live in such a beautiful place, and be able to share with our wonderful passengers. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist

Entry 4:
1:18 p.m. - roughly 30 Common Dolphin south of Narrows between Day Island and Fox Island
feeding in the rips, sonar says lots of food... No pics. -James Lewis
