Entry 3:
8:15 p.m. - A single whale, looks like the humpback, is hanging out in Carr Inlet
between Fox Is and Key Pen. Lots of breaching earlier, about 10 boats still gathered to watch whatever activity there is. I am too far away, and the setting sun is very bright, to see much at this point. -Erin Dugger Reetz

3:30 p.m. - Saw the humpback whale again right near Fox Island's Brick Kiln Road
area. He showed off, flipping his tail and breaching about
3:30 pm on Sunday the 16th! -Dawn Morris

Entry 4:
3 or 4 whales
today. One dove and showed its fluke not far off the
north end of Shilshole Bay Marina around
4:30pm
, then a few hours later we saw a whale spouting closer to Bainbridge, then shortly after another one spouting mid-channel, and finally this last treat of what
looks like a young humpback
tail slapping and breaching by the marina. What a day! Sorry I didn't get any video or photos clear enough to identify this whale. (cell video shows tail lobbing

Noon - Sunday,
July 16th we were headed to Matia from Jones Island and noticed a couple large boats cruising east
on the north side of Sucia and Matia
. At least 5 or six whale watching boats and another 5 or 6 private boats. Looked like a large open to me, but it's hard to tell. Headed east to south east. We stopped on Matia for 15 minutes and the. Headed back to Bellingham via the north end of lummi. When we left Matia, it looks like the
orcas were hanging around the south east side of Matia
bc the boats were hanging all around there. -Allison Evans

Here are a couple of photos of
U39
travelling east in the Strait of Juan de Fuca on
July 16, 2017. The close-up shows lunch-to-go, which he grabbed so fast we couldn't tell whether it was a seal or porpoise. -Photo by Val Shore,

Entry 7:
Humpback
. We were there for 3 hours when this creature entertained the crowd of boats. Amazing display as he circled around. He left the cove about
8 pm
still slapping his tail and breaching. -Heather Hazen-Gross
