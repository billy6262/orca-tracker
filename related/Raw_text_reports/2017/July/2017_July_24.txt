Orca Sightings for July 24, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
First confirmed record of CA171B in BC
. Meet CA171B, otherwise known as
Fatfin
! After initial confusion over his identification, photographer and social media assistant Grace Guiney suggested that the male was the famous Fatfin from California....Fatfin is thought to be about 18 years old...We're very excited to have this rare sighting of him! He traveled right
in front of Victoria towards Race Rocks
, where we left him. At first he was with the other Ts, but he quickly left them behind and was motoring along at high speed! -Photo by Grace Guiney,

Entry 2:
(
Report by Eagle Wing WW. ID confirmed by Alisa Schulman-Janiger, California Killer Whale Project
)

Entry 3:
CA171B Fat Fin
- The 9am tour aboard Eagle Wing stumbled across an
exotic killer whale from California known as CA171B "Fatfin"
, along with the
T69s, T90s, and T2B
. This combination of transients exhibited foraging behaviour and was quite active afterwards, suggesting that they succeeded in their hunt. Later, on our way to and from Race Rocks Ecological Reserve, we found
three humpbacks
! All in all the tour was wonderful and as an added bonus the weather couldn't have been better. Thanks Captain Jeff! -Eagle Wing WW
