Entry 1:
Bigg's killer whales (Transients) -
T46 and her son T46D
(born 2000) in

Approx

3:00 p.m. - They were nearing Polnell Point
- long down times. I barely glimpsed them - not sure if they'll head around the point or turn south down Saratoga. -Jill Hein
*
They
left Penn Cove about
2:20
or so, caught very distant look at them from Long Point around
2:45, then lost them...really far away. Too far for i.d.s

2:05 p.m. - At least 3
including 1 male across from Coupeville Wharf on Oak Harbor side of Penn Cove.
A member of the T46s tail lobbing in Penn Cove.
Very active as if on/or celebrating a kill; breaches, cartwheels, gulls swooping. -Bonnie Gretz

1:10 p.m. -
Not completely sure but we think we just saw
a couple of Orca at the mouth of Penn Cove
. East of Monroe Landing and closer to that side too. We were across the way and, based on your description one was male. We lost sight of them but they appeared to be headed towards Coupeville or maybe the mussel rafts. -Maureen Denny
