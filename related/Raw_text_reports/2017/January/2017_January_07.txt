Orca Sightings for January 7, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Bigg's killer whales (Transients) - "Orcinus" arrived on scene about
halfway between CWR and Smugglers Cove at 1600. The whales were the four members of the T18s
and, when they came up from a long dive at the south end of Mitchell Bay, they were in two pairs with T19 and T19B ahead of the other two and nearer to the mouth of Mitchell Bay. T18 and T19C were deeper in the bay... -Center for Whale Research Encounter 3

Humpback whales
Spotted by a friend from
Owen Beach at
4:00
. No info about direction. -Julie Merriman
*
Saw it breach several times (looked like a juvenile) and vocalized as he spouted water through his blowhole. Near the shore right off the Point
around
3:30pm
. He was milling about probably eating and slowly heading for
Owens Beach
. -Christina Felty
*

3:12 p.m. - Dalco Passage Viewpoint. Humpback
spotted. Looking to be going east or milling. -Ronda Walters
*
Saw a breach! We saw him last at
1400
heading
towards the Tacoma Narrows Bridge from Pt. Defiance.

1:17 p.m. -
Our little
humpback friend is still off Point Defiance
. Island explorer 4 is viewing and will be until
13:45. -Scott Jacobson

My boyfriend, saw it (
humpback
) breach twice this morning on his way
from Gig Harbor to Tacoma
. It was about a 1/2 mile south of Pt Defiance towards the narrows bridge at about

11:30 am
. I hope it finds its way out of here. They don't have a good track record of surviving long this far down in the sound. -Peggy Claar
*
Just an FYI about
humpback
observation from S
almon Beach (Tacoma, near Pt. Defiance)
. We've seen this little humpback at night on
Dec. 23, 24 and again last night (1/7/2017) around 9pm to 10 pm
. In close to shore (100-ft from shore) moving somewhat slow. I suspect it's the same one we've been seeing for the past month or so around this vicinity. I hope we're observing healthy behavior
*
I saw the whale breach about

12:00
in front of my house in the Sinclair Inlet in Port Orchard! I live next to
Watermam dock in Port Orchard
. The whale was grey and covered in barncles, sorry that's all I know. I only saw its breach of its back. It was headed south towards Port Orchard. (
description sounds like a gray

So. California - Eastern Tropical Pacific killer whales -
3:35 p.m.
- Orcas! The five rarely encountered Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) killer whales from Mexico that we saw on Saturday Jan 7th
between Pt. Vicente, Newport Beach and Laguna Beach California
. -Debora Norton,

Entry 2:

Rare Orcas:
An eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) killer whale female and her calf travel from Long Beach to Newport Beach, CA
on Sat, 7 Jan 2016. An amazing first encounter with these mysterious whales from southern waters. The very small number of confirmed predation events involving killer whales from the ETP have included sea lions, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, blue whale, fin whale, Bryde's whale, and humpback whale. However, this does not mean that those individuals involved eat only marine mammals; some could be specialists in a particular prey type, others could be generalists. It is impossible to make a sweeping statement about all of the killer whales across the Eastern North Pacific - without observational data and biopsies which would enable fatty acid analysis and genetics analysis (determining haplotypes). -Alisa Schulman-Janiger, researcher, CA killer whale Research Project
