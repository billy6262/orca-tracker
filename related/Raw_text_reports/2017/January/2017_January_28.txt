This morning about

9:30 am
we were treated to a fabulous energetic display of
about 6 females (juvenile included) 1 male while on Possession Sound between Gedney Is and Everett
likely fishing?? Our private passenger ferry was able to stop on route going West to enjoy the activity, close up of female breaching do you know which resident group this??? Most passengers saw Orcas in the wild first time ever! Amazing. UPDATE: Sorry we docked and lost sight as they seemed stationary don't think they went south or west of Gedney (Hat). -Charlene & Chuck

5-10 Orca moving quickly, heading south-west between Whytecliff Park and Passage Island, Queen Charlotte Channel
. Was sitting on a bench at Whytecliff park in West Vancouver,looking out at Passage Island when all of a sudden a big male dorsal fin appears. There were two males and five-seven females. One of the big males was by itsself and came up for air really close to the Whytecliff Park Islet. Some of them swam around Bird Islet and they were all heading towards Passage Island. Lost sight of them as they went around Passage Island. Not sure if they were Transients or the Southern Residents. Observed from Shore. -Jarod Adams, West Vancouver, BC
