Orca Sightings for January 19, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
2:55 p.m. - at the Narrows Viewpoint
- I was at The
5 Mile Drive today (Pt Defiance)
and pulled over to take a phone call. If you watch these 2 videos (not able to include), in the center of the screen you can see something and it's blowing water. Can you tell me if this was possibly a whale? I thought I was saying things for a good 10 minutes before I finally got out of my car and walked over to the fence to take a video. (
video shows back and blows at a distance, probably the small humpback who has taken up temporary residence in that area - ALB
) -Amanda Edwards
*
Unidentified whales - north Puget Sound
(either
2nd small humpback or gray whale
reported inland days prior)

2:45 p.m. -
Some kind of slow moving cetacean at
North Beach/Carkeek
headed south around the corner toward Golden Gardens. A few breaths about 5 minutes apart. Not a huge whale, no sign of a dorsal... maybe a small humpback? -Stephen Sommerfeld
*
Around Noon -
Saw several spouts from a smallish whale
off the Edmonds dog park
today headed south. Wind was strong and we were a good distance away so I couldn't get a good id. Was not an orca I don't think but perhaps a small Humpback? -Toby Black
