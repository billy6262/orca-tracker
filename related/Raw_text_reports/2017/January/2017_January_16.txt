============================================================

Entry 1:
Humpback whales

4:42 p.m. -
It was seen breaching
off the Narrows viewpoint
maybe 10 minutes ago. Not sure where it's going to pop up next!

4:05 p.m. - Just surfaced off the Gig Harbor viewpoint
. Still heading North. -Heidi Powers Armstrong

"The humpback taken at around

3:20 off of Dalco Viewpoint
. It circled around in front of us for around half an hour before I had to leave." -Connor O'Brien

I have seen the tail twice off the
North End of (Point Defiance) at
3:05 and
3:10
. -Allison Stewart Bishins

About 90 min ago (

2:45 p.m.
) our little
humpback was enjoying the waters below Dalco Passage Viewpoint
, surfacing and diving in a circle it seemed. Showed off his tail flukes fairly often, followed by one big beautiful breach! -Monica Janke Herlocker

1:25 p.m. -
Island explorer 4 is currently at
Point Defiance with Speckles the humpback whale
! -Carl Williams
*
Still there at

1:24pm with 2 boats and 2 kayaks
keeping appropriate distance. -Michele Riley Campbell
*

12:23 p.m. -
Just saw
Speckles off Pt. Defiance
! Nice tail fluke! It seemed to be feeding close to Owens beach heading slowly East. -Mary Hogan
*
We went to the beach again today: from

1:00-
3:30 we saw The little Humpback in the same spot from Owen Beach
every 5-15 min or so. He/she did a big breach (I got a pic but it's sadly out of focus) it swims fast and far in between coming up, you don't know where to look. I was running up and down the beach like a crazy woman (I have so much fun). On the drive out we stopped at the
Dalco Viewpoint
, just as I was getting out of my car we saw it do a big breach again (didn't get camera out in time) very cool to see! Lots of people at the Viewpoint looking for it too, all very nice people. -Desiree Sauve
*
These photos were taken from the Island Adventure
4 in the early afternoon
(around

1:30 to
2:00 pm
). The young
humpback
(Speckles) was surfacing near the
tip of Point Defiance and Vashon Viewpoint
. After the boat got within viewing distance, he/she started making circles around us, taking breaths and diving around every 6 minutes. Two kayakers and the small boat pictured were nearby but kept safe distances, although the humpback wanted to get close for a better view of them. -Ashley Miller
*
Juvenile Humpback in Dalco Passage
with nasty wounds and scars around the fluke, most likely from being entangled in some sort of line/gear which s/he thankfully appears now to be free of. -Kristina Trowbridge
