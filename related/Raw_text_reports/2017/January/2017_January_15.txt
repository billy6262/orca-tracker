Orca Sightings for January 15, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
There were
quite a few orcas in front of Campbell River Sunday
. My husband saw them while out fishing and they were headed South. No idea which ones though. It was around
10am
Sunday. No pictures unfortunately as my husband is not nearly as interested as I am in them but between him and his friend they seemed to think there were between 40-60... which I imagine they were wrong about. Said there were
many groups of 5-7
in different spots all over the channel
from Quadra to Mitllenatch island
. Some large males. All seemed to be heading south. Apparently some breeching and spy hoping activity too. My husband has spent a lot of time on the water in his life and said this was by far the most he had ever seen at once. That is pretty much all the details I have though... was hoping some of the local whale watching groups would have had more info but I haven't seen any. -Shari Lynne

Common dolphins
At around

4:20 this afternoon, between Harstine and Herron Islands
, I saw what I believe to be
a small pod of common dolphins
. Unfortunately it was a very short encounter so I am not sure about number. They were headed North. -Connor O'Brien
