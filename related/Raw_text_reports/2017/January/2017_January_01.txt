Orca Sightings for January 1, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Around noon
on
January 1st we observed from our house a group of
5 Orcas traveling West in Deception Pass, just East of the Bridge
. They seemed to circle around once before we lost sight of them. They were just about 50 yards off the Northern shore. -Terry Burkhardt

Photos below, ID notes by Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research : "Yes, that is T87 and T124C in the second photo. And yes, I do think that is T85 in the first picture and the fin shape is right for T85B and T85C on the other two. The T85s are not common around here and I personally have not seen them in over ten years. I hope they show up up here! Thanks for sending the pics. Dave.
