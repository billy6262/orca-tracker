Orca Sightings for January 9, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
...Dave headed down to Snug Harbor and left aboard "Orcinus" around 1130. The
first whales encountered were right off Smugglers Cove at 1142. This was J16, J42, and J50
and they were doing some milling as they headed slowly north. J42 was slightly ahead and offshore of J16 and J50 who were tight together. There was a male about three quarters of a mile or more to the west-southwest of this group and Dave headed out to him next. The male was J26 as expected and he was foraging as he moved slowly north. -Center for Whale Research Encounter 4
