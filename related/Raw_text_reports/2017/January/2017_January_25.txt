Orca Sightings for January 25, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Thanks to Rod King on 4Ever Wild for heads up for
a large group of east bound T's in the Juan de Fuca
. We saw a large group of females and juveniles with a new calf mid strait south of Bechey Head. The
T086A's were among the group and the T101's were several miles inshore on the Canadian side
. I sent a picture to Dave Ellifrit and he suspects that I had a shot of T071B. It looks like the
T071's were there
and I was able to confirm
T124D
as well. She may have been the mother of the newish calf. -Mark Malleson
