S/He was there at the

today...It looked to be just milling about. It was quite close to shore, maybe just a couple hundred yards out. There was one boat shadowing it. I was there for about 30 minutes, and I saw it surface and blow 4 or 5 times. I've gone there many times to try to see one, and today was my first time. So exciting! -Gina Marie Gothe
