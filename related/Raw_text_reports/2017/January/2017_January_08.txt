Dolphins/Porpoise
Watched a pod of
8-10 dolphins or porpoises off Owen Beach
this morning, I think their body shapes might have been more like the
common dolphin
. They were leaping high out of the water and very active until a sea lion appeared, and then reversed course and swam underwater and vanished... From the pictures and descriptions,
my guess is Pacific white-sided dolphins
. They were very black, and I think the dorsals were curved. I may have overestimated the numbers, as they were in and out of the water very rapidly. They definitely came completely out of the water, however. There was the agitated sea lion also there, and possibly the sea lion was chasing them??? Definitely too small for orcas...I also watched as the sea lion bark aggressively at a man standing on the beach. The sea lion had been swimming rapidly back and forth parallel to the beach after the dolphin/porpoise pod left. -Linda Cohen
