Entry 2:
T137s (Plus?) -
7:48 p.m. - Orcas between Golden Gardens and Carkeek
headed north about a mile off shore - 4 to 5 (1 large male). -Tony Bahnick
*

19:29 - At North Beach
still headed north. They were on a mission going by. They were moving, but saw at least 4. One bigger male followed by 3 females grouped together. One looked quite small. -Stephen Sommerfeld
*

7:35 p.m. - Turned out to be 3
I believe. They have cleared the
Golden Gardens
. Heading north;

7:15 p.m. -
Surfaced for a second farther out from Golden Park heading north still. Thanks everyone for the updates to help us see them. -Misty Lane
*

6:47 p.m. - Pod of 5 or 6
just rounded West point headed towards
Golden Gardens
. They hung around the Fort Lawton side for about 20 minutes, lots of milling, diving, tales flying every which way, quick course changes and even had a seal try to escape unsuccessfully under my boat. I took about 400 photos from todays orcas from the West Point beach area to Golden Gardens before they headed towards mid channel and off into the sunset North Bound. A shot of the youngest breaching one of three times while I was shooting. Off Golden Gardens north bound at a good pace. Lots of breaching..made a kill off the channel to the locks and celebrated then took off. What an experience when the male surfaced 20 ft from us....This shot is just off the Shilshole Breakwater, ...what ended up as about three kills, lots of milling, diving, quick course changes and even a seal trying to hide under my boat causing the big male to charge towards us out of nowhere. -Gary Peterson
*

6:45 p.m. -
I arrived at a very busy
West Point lighthouse, Discovery Park in time to see at least 4
just south of the point. Female and calf in lead...male and juvenile trailing. They rounded West Point lighthouse close to shore. I ran to the north side to catch a glimpse of the male directly out from me descend quite vigoroulsy underwater as if to catch up. All eastbound headed towards Shilshole. Such a Long dive, I think they changed course underwater and surfaced more directionally to the north than they were heading when they went down. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
