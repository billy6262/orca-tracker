Sept 29th trip report - with news that
J-pod was near Partridge Bank
, we headed south in light rain, passing
Minor Island
on the way to check out the harbor seals and birds. With a photography group on board, we were rewarded with amazing action from J-pod whales, they were spread out over a large area but we were able to get good looks at them. Those most visible to us were
J27 Blackberry, and L87 Onyx
, both such beauties. Tons of breaching and huge tail slaps - it was SO GOOD to see them again. We even had sun on our return trip. Looking forward to seeing many more photos from today's trip, hoping members of the photography group will post to our page!! Stay tuned! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

traveling north and a bit west with lots of activities mixed in.

11:40 a.m. - About 20 Residents, members of JPod identified plus L87. (Note: Yesterday and today L87 has remained pretty separate and lagging behind the rest of Jpod. Still right offshore slowly moving straight north along shore.

. -Susan Marie Andersson

People aboard the Coupeville to Port Townsend ferry crossing this morning had the good fortune to transect with J pod and L87 who were making their way north out Admiralty Inlet after their overnight stay inland Puget Sound. Pod of approximately
15 orcas seen at around
10:15 a.m. this morning while on a ferry boat from Coupeville to Port Townsend, WA
. They were spread out and traveling at a slow speed in the direction of Coupeville. A few were doing tail slaps. Coordinates: 48 08 419 N 122 41 134 W. What an awesome surprise to see them on our way to set up for my daughter's wedding tomorrow. I flew up from SoCal yesterday and wasn't expecting to see these beauties. -Robin Lowe
