Just one from tonight as my eyes are shot from the smoke. After watching
Transients come out of Sinclair Inlet and into Rich Passage
, I took a painfully long detour to
South Beach (Bainbridge Is.
). I was sitting on the bench there, not knowing if I was behind or ahead of the whales, when I heard the first blow. Then I heard a second much closer and louder. They swam by so close, and it was just me and the whales.

On
September 16th we encountered
6 of the 9 whales in the T65A and T99 matrilines
, pictured here (see photo below).This encounter for us was in
San Juan and Spieden Channels
in the evening about
5-6 PM
. It's not unusual for some members of a group to seemingly "appear" and "disappear" throughout an encounter, but apparently this was a bit of a longer separation than usual, because our next two transient encounters included those "missing" three whales and not the rest of their families! It seems unusual to us that
T65A3 (age 10), T65A4 (age 6) and T99B (age 10)
would separate from their families for several days at their age, so we're wondering if it was an intentional separation or if they "got lost", but we will never know for sure! We did hear today, however, that the three roaming sub-adults were reunited with their mothers today! -Monika Wieland Shields, Orca Behavior Institute
