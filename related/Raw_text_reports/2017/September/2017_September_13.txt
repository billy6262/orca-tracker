After a transient killer whale filled summer, we're pleased to share that we've had
seven straight encounters with the Southern Residents as the majority of L-Pod has decided to spend some time in inland waters
. Here's a shot of

After coming
down San Juan Channel
on their way south from the Fraser River, the
19 whales in sub-group of L-Pod
I call the Greater L4s
exited Cattle Pass
and made a bee-line for the L12 sub-group that had been foraging off San Juan Island for a few days. -Photo by Monika Wieland Shields,

The
majority of L-Pod has hung around for a few days
, and it was too beautiful not to get out for a short visit with them this evening.
L55 Nugget, L118 Jade, and L123 Lazuli
