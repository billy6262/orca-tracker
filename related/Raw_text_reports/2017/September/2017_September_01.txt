Twice I saw a (grey) whale arch up showing her dorsal. I was at
Rocky Point, Whidbey Island
. It had slanted dorsal, not like an orca but smaller. Wow I've never seen a humpback like this before. She seemed to be feeding, following krill or these shiny schools of silver fish. And a sea lion bopping up his head from time to time. What a beautiful place to enjoy such nature. -Diane Jandreau

reported as gray but w/dorsal
sounds like humpback
