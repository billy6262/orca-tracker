Entry 6:
Swanson, Hein and to Eastern Bank
where we found a group of Dall's porpoise - and a
Minke
whale who was being elusive. Continuing to Smith Island, we found Tufted Puffins, AND
another Minke whale
. This whale appeared to be a juvenile - we had great looks at him as he came close to us to check us out ... what a treat. The water was glass calm and easy to see our wildlife, with lots of harbor porpoise "flashing" by us. How lucky we were finding so much wildlife? Thank you Capt. Eric. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
