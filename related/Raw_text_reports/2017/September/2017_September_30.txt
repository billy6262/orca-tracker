Orca Sightings for September 30, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Hello, I saw the post about the
unidentified dolphin at Kingston
the morning of Saturday 9/30. Probably the same individual passed by Hansville just off the beach maybe 1 - 2 hours earlier. We had never seen an orca before, so we assumed this was a small orca - it was black, and some of us thought we saw some white on the head. It was repeatedly porpoising to breathe at very regular intervals (100 - 200 feet or so?), but not enough to get the jaws or possibly even eyes out of the water, and blew a spout each time. We could hear the spout/breath from 200 yards. Was it really a dolphin? It was at least 12 feet long and moved a lot of water when it came up...-Rod Lundberg

Dolphins -

Entry 2:
10:15 about 30 ft off shore, Apple Tree Point
. I thought it was Orca coming as it was very large (small for Orca) ID type? Steady southbound. From a distance could see a large dorsal fin but as it approached, was more clear. It was much bigger than what I've seen here before. -Sara Frey

Entry 3:
10:00 a.m. - South Puget Sound. Unknown number of common dolphins,
heading south into
Budd Inlet
, near the tip of Cooper Point. Very active and near the western shore. They are now out of sight. -Kim Merriman

"
Yes I think a
bottlenose dolphin
, which are occasional visitors to our area though their primary range is northern California and south." - John Calambokidis, CRC
"My best guess would be
bottlenose
. There have been a couple that have come into the Sound in recent years, and the dorsal and rostrum look about right." - Dave Anderson, CRC

Dall's porpoise -

September 30 - Fall is definitely here...we left the marina in a light mist that shortly turned to rain. As we headed north through the San Juans, we received a report of "orcas heard on Lime Kiln hydrophones, but faint." We did come across about
20 lovely little Dall's porpoises
(who are not easy to photograph!), who sped around the boat, off
Middle Bank
. We had a great visit with the big handsome Steller Sea Lions at Whale Rocks, including one who is molting. A beautiful, damp, but lovely day on the Salish Sea! -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist.
