Monday morning Mystic Sea left port with warm air, sunny skies, and flat calm waters. We first cruised to Colville where we stopped to see harbor seals lounging about in one of their favorite places. We continued on towards
Salmon Bank
where we were so thankful to find members of
L-pod
(finally!), including the
L12s
. We stayed with L-pod for the day, and Mystic Sea passengers and crew saw something that is very rare -
L85 (also known as Mystery) swimming alongside a juvenile minke whale
! One of our crew members caught a short video of them surfacing near each other, as everyone looked on excitedly. To round out an already amazing day, Captain Eric cruised us to Smith Island where we found nearly 20 puffins and Minor Island where additional harbor seals could be seen. We were back at port by 4pm with a fantastic day of whales and wildlife etched in our memories. -Amy W., Mystic Sea

Entry 5:
2:45pm
we were approximately 3 miles northeast of the RA buoy headed back
towards Cattle Pass when a minke whale breached
in the distance twice, lunged in the water twice, and then breached again! There were Southern Resident orcas in the area including
L25
who was about 250 yards away from him, and
L41
who was about 400 yards on his other side. We also heard on the radio that there was
a small juvenile minke whale hanging out near L85
....We saw another
minke
in the distance who was traveling towards
L77 and L119
. We're not sure if it is the same minke that we saw breaching an hour later. Plus, someone was with orcas and a minke whale near the Salmon Bank marker...It was incredible to see! -Cheers, Barbara Howitt, All Aboard Sailing
