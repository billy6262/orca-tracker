Orca Sightings for September 10, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
L4s
! There's something about a good rain bringing in the salmon, and hence the whales as well. We got our first few days of steady rainfall in about 3 months and sure enough this morning we were surprised to learn the
L4s (9 whales) were in Haro Strait
, where they spent the day! Here is
L82
Kasatka passing American Camp this afternoon. -Monika Wieland Shields

Entry 3:
transient orcas, a humpback and a Minke
. Time of
transient encounter was
1:00 pm at Eastern Bank
(Strait of Juan de Fuca) The
T65As
joined forces with the
T99s
to make a formidable foe for the resilient harbor seal on their radar, fighting hard for survival. The orcas worked cooperatively and systematically to wear down their prey, leaving much of the work to the younger members of the group. This was nature in the raw with the full power of the ocean's top predator in sharp contrast to our later encounter with the gentle humpback and Minke baleen whales. The HB and the Minke were both in the same area between Smith and Minor Islands and NAS Whidbey spotted
2:45pm. -Sandra Pollard, Author/Naturalist. (Photos Richard Snowberger using 300 mm lens plus - all photos cropped).

7:22 p.m. -
Last I saw they were heading north on the
east of Vashon towards Pt Robinson
, we were at Brown's Point! We left about 5 mins ago.

7:02 p.m. -
Just spotted them again, heading north up
Maury Island
.

6:55 p.m. - just south of Maury Island
heading north, possibly into Quartermaster Harbor. -Kim Boeve Bolman
*

6:25 p.m. -
I was sitting on the deck of the
Tacoma Yacht Club facing out toward Vashon Island
when I saw what I thought were
orca whale fins
emerge from the water. A small sailboat was nearby, and I saw it maneuver to give the whales some distance. I saw a
large male, and one or two females
. They each surfaced a number of times. They were too far for me to capture on my phone, but I was so thrilled to see them. I grew up in Tacoma, and I've only seen orcas once in the South Puget Sound, so this was exciting! I thought they were feeding at first, because there were 2-3 whales just east of the Pt. Defiance-Tahlequah ferry path between Pt. Defiance and Vashon, and they appeared to stay in one spot for a little bit. However, then they started to travel, and I saw them surface around Neill Point and then glimpsed them again near Piner Point. 47°19'44.6"N 122°30'20.7"W. -Maria Manza
*
We saw them from the ferry on
Vashon (we were headed back to Pt. Defiance) at approx
6:25 p.m.
Looked like they were right off the Point headed east towards the ferry dock at the time. Saw at least
3 different whales
surface at once. Very exciting! -Tishelle Atkins Ward
*

6:18 p.m. -
Passed the point at
6:05, heading into Vashon inlet currently at
6:18
. last I saw they were headed into this area (indicated Dalco Pass, south Maury/Vashon). Boats are still over there (
6:36) but I'm on a paddleboard at Owen beach so I can't really get closer. -Britt Birdhouse
*
We got to see
T137A
travelling north today from the
Narrows Bridge to Pt. Defiance
. One of the remakarable observations was seeing a Sea Lion near our boat with Orca's travelling about a 1/4 mile away or less at Pt Defiance. T he Sea Lion came up with a fish in his mouth as the Orca's travelled away. Usually we don't see Sea Lions or Harbor Seals anywhere near the T's. I think the Orca fed well in the south sound. -Zeno Martin

We got to spend an hour watching an
Orca family
hunt down their Sunday dinner along
Narrows Beach in Gig Harbor
! There was a large male (
T137A
), two smaller adults and an adorable Juvenile. At the
4:00 mark of the video there are three tail slaps and a nice side fin slap too. That slap was so loud it sounded like a crack of lightning! At the
6:15 mark you can see the male appear to do an end-over-end underwater. A mini-jump at
9:35. Thanks to the Orca network and all the followers for all you do! Hope you enjoy. -Mark Schurer
