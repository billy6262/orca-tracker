September 7 & early hour of 8th - Saratoga Passage - My wife and I were fortunate enough to see and hear
orcas
for our first time, tonight. I first heard a heavy breathing sound about 200 yards off shore at around

8:45pm
at 2300 block
Hidden Beach drive, Greenbank
. I just checked again at

12:15 AM
9/8/2017 and more breathing noises in very calm waters. Extremely humbling experience and somewhat sad as I read they may be having difficulty finding food. There are too many of us on the planet. Thank you for the work you do. To complete the report as requested. 2 confirmed 5-6ft dorsal fins swimming together. First headed southbound towards Baby island but then 3 1/2 hrs later we could hear more breathing off shore about 200 yes from our bulkhead. There were two other females at the
8:45 pm sighting. Behavior was breaching, blowing steam and what I would characterize as feeding given distance covered in seconds. -Michael Curneen
*

Entry 4:
Lopez Island and found a humpback whale
- waiting for us! He came fairly close for a visit so we had some great looks at him, but wait - here's another humpback wanting to visit also. After some quick looks we headed towards a new orca report - south towards
Eastern Bank where we found Transient/Biggs killer whales, T18, T19 and T19C -
had a nice visit with them which rounded out the day. Every day is different - who will we see tomorrow? Can't wait to find out -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.

1510-1625
- Species:
2 Humpbacks
- Position: Original sighting
approx 1.0 nm northwest of Edmonds ferry
. Behavior: Traveling together steadily to the northwest at approx 2-4 knots. Typical arched back for terminal dives but only once did both display raised flukes (photos). Respiration: Consistent 5-7 breadths between dives. Dives consistently 9-10 minutes in length. Observed from: 45' sailboat sailing steadily to the northwest. Photos should be enough for positive IDs, but I have more photos if needed, some showing scars. -Gary Carter

7:15 p.m. - The Hammersley post - the whale
was heading back out toward Arcadia Point. I think it was humpback (

whale
, but we just had a nighttime encounter, again just yards offshore from our bulkhead. My wife heard all kinds of splashing, and when we went out, we are fairly certain we saw a small whale.
