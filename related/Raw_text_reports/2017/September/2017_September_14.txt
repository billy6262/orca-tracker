Watched
orcas from just north of Clinton Ferry terminal to Langley

4:45 -
6:30 pm
. First saw them in the ferry lanes, somewhat closer to the Whidbey side, active and splashing...pretty sure hunting and killing prey...hard to narrow down photos, but truly I did. There were around 7 of them, at least 2 males and a young one and 4 females, just making the best guess...Still in awe, loved hearing them breathe and exhale. There is something about shore/land based whale watching, hard to explain... some of the photos zoomed, most are cropped. By
6:20 p.m. - they had passed Sandy Point and are heading toward Langley. ..."There is something about shore/land based whale watching, hard to explain.." -Marilyn Armbruster

Entry 4:
Humpbacks
!
Humpback BCY0409 "Yogi" off San Juan Island.
Orca reports today had those whales far south, far west and far north - so we headed towards
Cattle Pass to find two humpbacks
reported traveling southbound. We found them in beautifully calm seas, and had excellent views as they continued on their journey, with a lot of diving and showing of their flukes (tails). Lots more wildlife to see, by Smith/Minor Islands we found Tufted Puffins, lots of harbor seals hauled out and at Bird Rocks a bunch of Steller Sea Lions enjoying the sun. No two days are alike on the Salish Sea! -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist.
