Orca Sightings for September 26, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
A group of 15 Orcas passed by Point Roberts between 3 and 330 pm
. Travelling quickly, heading south then across the Strait of Georgia to Saturna Island, small groups of 2-4, three large males. I believe one of the males could have been L87 based on the shape of the dorsal fin. Hope so! -Sandra Scott
*
Js and Ls cruising south from Pt Roberts.
Their groups were all jumbled up.
L82 and L87 hanging together; J26, 27, 39 and L92 traveling with J19. L103 & J41
were socializing together with their little boys. We were able to shut down and drop a hydrophone and listen to them chat it up.
L103
tail lobbing,
J51
spyhopping, and
J41
logging at the surface. J41 and L103 seemed to be getting in some quality girl time together with their boys having a play date. J51 and L123 both got good spy hops in.
L123 and L103
cruising south from Pt. Roberts. -Ariel Yseth

Entry 3:
Mama T11 off Sooke again today.
Always great to find my favorite local Transients today...again! After visiting 12 of the
20+ humpbacks of the Salish Sea
in the
Juan De Fuca Strait from Sooke to Jordan River
we were cruising back to the docks...and as always I say we will run the shoreline and look for Orca...Well shortly Deanna says hey there is one right there... 2 miles out and she spots T11a! -Paul Pudwell

Entry 4:
T10C was with his mom just outside of Deer Harbor
on the
afternoon
of 9/26/17. They started the morning supposedly on the N end of Griffin Bay before disappearing into the fog and then were seen in
San Juan Channel heading toward Deer Harbor
. We found them exiting the Harbor and back out to the Channel heading north. We then buzzed up to
Pt Roberts where we found J&Ls in a travel/socializing
mode making their way southbound. All taken aboard Spirit of Orca. -Ariel Yseth

Entry 5:
1:39 p.m. - Lone male T87 Puget Sound off Possession Point, South Whidbey.
they are heading straight for
Possession Point
, not sure if they will go up Saratoga or Admiralty.

1:29 p.m. - T100Bs (who T87 often travels with)
They made a kill, now trending once again NW, close to Whidbey side. I'm thinking, one male, little one and 2 females.

12:54 p.m. - 4 orcas near in North Puget
Sound south of
Possession Point
trending slowly northwest into Admiralty. May be more than 4. -Janine Harles

Entry 9:
5:45 p.m. -
Seeing spouts
south of Point No Point
in shipping lane seen from Picnic Point with binoculars. I was looking for that (if humpback or the pod of Bigg's -ALB) thought I saw a multiple (blows) initially later I thought I saw a hump that lingered for a long time so not quite sure (which species). -John Carroll

On Tues Sept 26th, while
crossing from Victoria to Port Angeles, we saw a dolphin
at the end of the spit as we came into port. I did not get any photos but there was just one animal traveling out of the bay... definitely not a harbour porpoise. -Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn
