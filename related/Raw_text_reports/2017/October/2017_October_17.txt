seeing some of the orcas closer to the Whidbey side,
about a mile south of Bush Pt.
still foraging but still trending NW I believe...

5:00 p.m. -
there are still some orcas way down
off the green channel marker
, others spread out NW of there, and swimming in every direction possible, looks like they are having dinner!

4:40 p.m. - there are more further SE, closer to
Point No Point
, definite foraging, direction changes, lunges, tail lobs - hope they are finding, sharing and eating a lot of salmon!

4:35 p.m. - seeing the orcas between Hansville (Kitsap side) and Double Bluff (Whidbey side)
, look to be closer to Hansville. They are trending NW up Admiralty Inlet, but still look like they are foraging - some lobtailing and direction changes. -Susan Berta, Orca Network

in the northbound traffic lane. -Jason Mihok

3:06 p.m. -
wow! I just happened to swing the big eyes around, trying to spot more blows and fins, and saw this big black thing hanging horizontally in the air over the water - then SPLASH as the whale landed! Just happened to catch it mid-breach! At 3 pm we were just able to spot them with our "big eyes" - looks like they are foraging, multidirectional still
south of the green channel marker, spread out in the Possession Triangle
, hopefully finding lots of fish! -Susan Berta, Orca Network

Humpback whales -

Entry 2:
4:20 p.m. -
While scouting for resident orcas, who were miles away towards the
entrance to Admiralty Inlet, a humpback
came into view in my binoculars. He was approximately
2-3 miles south of Cultus Bay/Possession Point heading south.
A few minutes later I watched him surface a several times again to the southwest, then I left. Never could see the SRKWs, too great a distance from Stamm Overlook Park, Edmonds on such a gray gray day. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
