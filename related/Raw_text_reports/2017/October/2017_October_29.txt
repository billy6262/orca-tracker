============================================================

Entry 1:
8:20 am. - Bottlenose Dolphin
close to shore by
Lagoon Point, Whidbey Island
, moving quickly north. -Margaret Marshall
*
I saw him (re: M Marshal
bottlenose
above) close up (
0800
on Sunday) about 75 ft off shore heading north at
Lagoon Point
. In the distance I thought it must be a dolphin of some kind but when he got close to the beach the size convinced me that he was a small whale even though it did not look like any I knew of. -Bob VonDrachek
