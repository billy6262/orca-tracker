Entry 3:
at least 5 milling about
just before sunset last night. They eventually headed south. Location was just
south of Point Whitehorn, Birch Bay
, they were easily seen from shore. No photos unfortunately. Sorry, not sure at all they were bottlenose. It was just before sunset so it was too dark to pick out features, but they were definitely larger than any porpoise we have observed previously. (in response to Bottlenose dolphin post - ALB). -Patty Crawley Campbell
