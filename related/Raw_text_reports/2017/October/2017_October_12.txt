Orca Sightings for October 12, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Fin whale -
For the third year in a row, a rare fin whale has been spotted in the Salish Sea,
just north of Port Angeles
. Our naturalist, Sam, was able to snag a few identifying shots (below) while observing nearby humpback whales (this
afternoon
). In
September 2015, a lone fin whale was spotted repeatedly in the area. That was the first live sighting of a fin whale in the Salish Sea since 1930. Last year, a different fin whale was located in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and remained for several months, making it all the way down to south Puget Sound. Based on the photos, this third whale is a juvenile and does not match the 2015 or 2016 whales. Could these "Fall Fins" be a new trend? Fin whales can reach lengths of 70+ feet when fully grown and are the second longest whales in the world. Researchers have been alerted and we'll be keeping an eye out from both our Anacortes and Port Angeles locations. Fingers crossed we are able to spot this rare visitor again! -Erin Johns Gless, Island Adventures WW

heading south bound. -Darlene Moneypenny

2:40 p.m. - humpback just south of Apple Cove Point
(Kingston) a few hundred yards offshore, pointed south on its last dive. -Sherman Page

2:25 p.m. - I have a humpback between me on Apple Tree point and the tip of Whidbey
- South bound. Probably mid channel. It looks to be large so I'm guessing not the juvenile. I need binoculars to get a good look. I did see the spout with the naked eye. -Photo by Sara Frey,
