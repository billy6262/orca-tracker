Entry 2:
*

5:57 p.m. - Saw a lone dorsal fin still heading into the bay by Elliott Bay marina
as the east bound ferry crossed behind it. -Rebecca Sherwood
*

5:41 p.m. -
Got a better look....one at least is heading into the Bay, very close to westbound Washington State Ferry.

5:38 p.m. -
Seeing blows in mouth of
Elliot Bay
from Duwamish Head, looks like they are still heading north. -Stephanie Raymond
*
Just had
three or four Orcas pass by heading towards Elliot bay on the
5:30 Bainbridge ferry
- we saw them on the starboard side, but captain made announcement of pod on the port side? So possibly two groups swimming by. heading into Elliot Bay, so south east. -Madison Duckworth
*
My orca sighting today took place from around

4:20-
5:40
and I
started viewing at Constellation but as the orcas headed north I moved to Alki. At around
5:20 it became clear that some of the orcas were moving into Elliot Bay
. The orcas were very spread out the entire time so it is hard for me to know how many there were without looking at the other reports. The funny thing is that I came to Alki in the hopes of seeing the residents after having given a presentation to a class of third graders about these same orcas. -Connor O'Brien
*

5:30 p.m. - Bainbridge crossing at sunset with the ferry surrounded by Orca!
What a great welcome home. We live in a MAGICAL place. xo -Photo by Kimberly Sylvester-Malzahn,

2:40 p.m. -
Orcas under an orca cloud! After much foraging out from Discovery Park these two groups anyhow have now committed themselves southbound. Last seen in the distance about
2:40 skirting Elliot Bay heading towards Alki/Restoration Point. This place we live, sublime.

2:00 p.m. -
The two groups here have
stalled & turned back and are foraging just south of the lighthouse
; one group just east of yellow mid channel buoy off West Point and another group south of and more east side of channel. Lots of big boys!

1:45 p.m. -
ON volunteer Jennifer Hammer and I moved to
West Point Lighthouse/Discovery Park
. Here but just a few minutes when she spots orcas coming around the point. We watched this family/group tightly grouped up round the point about a 1/4 mile offshore in lovely October winds and heavy chop. We are watching another group who is due west of Lighthouse mid channel, with one member breaching at least 3 times at least. All steady southbound powering along. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

Several fins passing quickly by
Fay Bainbridge
. Large male in mix. Very spread out, traveling south. Some are west of southbound shipping lane. -Susan Marie Andersson

1:00 p.m. -
They eventually continued on steady southbound course loosely spread, on east side of the Sound. Probably
out from Carkeek Park
about now.

12:25 p.m. - L88 and family group, presuming still the J16s (I've moved locations a couple of times) has been out foraging and has now moved in even closer to shore off Richmond Beach
Saltwater Park.They are inshore of the weather buoy which very seldom happens. Foraging
Noon -
Pods are spread miles apart north and south and across channel. It is difficult to tell anyone where they are because they are all over. That said Been watching who we think these are the trailers on the east side of channe off northend Richmond Beach; J16s with L84 & L88 near per Chilkat. Lots of breaches and foraging directional changes off RB as they continue south. Not sure where any of the others are at this point. Chilkat is leaving to go explore other places so don't use them as your guide. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

12:28 p.m. - L88 at Richmond Beach
now... Pod was initially southbound in mid channel then turned to the east. I had trouble seeing them for awhile because I didn't realize they were coming right at me! Taken from Richmond Beach Saltwater Park. -Photo by Ariel Yseth,

Can't confirm w/ binocs but will continue keeping an eye out and post if/when we see them from here

12:15 p.m - I
*
may
*
be seeing some spouts approaching Alki
. In Lower Queen Anne looking at the sliver of ocean that can be seen from my Grandma's window. I'm going to see if I can track down binoculars and confirm. -Katie Kirking

11:35 a.m. -
just passing
President Point, south of Kingston
, pretty much mid channel, heading south. Not sure (when asked if leaders or trailers) there are some on the Seattle side of the yellow channel marker south of Edmonds right now. -Joanne Graves
*

11:10 a.m. -
Still watching them stream southbound spread in all directions. Now with possibly trailers about
mid channel Kingston/Point Wells.
Some breaching, taillobbing, inverted rolls, pec slapping. Females and young can be very difficult to see in mild chop. A lot of males. And hundreds and hundreds of gulls!

10:45 a.m. -
I see several spread out north/south and across channel. At least one group including adult male south of Kingston Ferry west of mid channel, with others just north of Ferry dock including at least one male. And more more North and east (mid channel) coming, including male. All powering steady southbound in rough waters. -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network

A report this morning of
a large group of whales near Edmonds, turns out it was J pod with members of L pod
, also! They were soo spread out, we stayed with the J16's, saw
J17's and J22's. L88 Wavewalker, sole survivor of the L2 matriline, who now associates w/the L54s & L88 (sole survivor of L9 matriline), passes Point Wells,
Woodway (the tank farm) southbound on his way towards neighboring Richmond Beach. -Photo by Janine Harles,
