Orca Sightings for October 13, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
9:40 a.m. - CS631 Two Spot milling in current line off Possession Point
. Not diving. Frequent surface intervals. -Renee Beitzel
*
Unidentified cetaceans -

Entry 2:
1:00 p.m. - Humpback? Milling off North Beach, Port Townsend
. Watched it about 30 minutes. Looked to be
northerly of Point Wilson
. Perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 miles out. Made several 10-15 minutes transits. Back and forth along a ~se/sw line. Submerging as long as ~5 minutes. No tail flukes.... Good question. That's why I "question marked" humpback in my op. Too far for me too positively is between hb and minke. Didn't see exhalations but very far away. I'm leaning toward minke myself. Hope you (we) find the humpback. -Rick Hatten

Dolphins -

Entry 3:
a single small cetacean seen heading north from Pier 69
in Seattle was shown to Fred Felleman today about
4:30.

We are at the
Edgewater hotel in Seattle
, and while enjoying treats and looking out the window we had what I am sure is
a dolphin swim by
. It was really close. We tried to take a picture but sun glare and age of phone prevented a quality dorsal image. The folks sitting around us said that he/she has made several passes this afternoon. We saw him/her about

3:45
. -Kendal Holmes Berry

Relaying this info from another observer: @

3:10pm unidentified dolphin
was milling nearshore off
Myrtle Edwards beach
, no distinct direction of travel. This same individual has been spotted by 3 different observers within our group working around the bay
since approx
10:00am this morning
. It has changed direction multiple times
between pier 66 and 70
during the past few hours. -Paula von Weller

1:26 p.m. -
Still out there! Cruising back and forth (north south)

12:42 p.m. -
still working the shoreline along
pier 70
. Making trips both north and south. Close to shore!

11:33 a.m - Pretty sure the dolphin from this morning is now passing pier 70/downtown Seattle
. Single fin, no signs saddle markings (which is why I think its the dolphin from earlier). -Troy Hightower
*

11:24 a.m. -
Now swimming adjacent to
Myrtle Edwards park
just below the PI globe. -Dorothy Hanson Harris
*

8:38 a.m. -
almost to bath house still very close to show shore. I think this is actually the bottlenose. Fairly certain this was the
bottlenose
. Got one decent look at its head and the beak looked awfully blunt for a common dolphin. Didn't see any of yellow the commons have and I've never seen them alone before. When I first spotted it I thought it was a small orca. Sorry I didn't get any pictures, my phone camera died.

8:32 a.m. - eastbound of north side of Alki Beach
about 50 yards off beach. Straight out from Cactus.

8:18 a.m. - nearing Alki Point
again northbound about 100 yards off shore.

8:16 a.m. -
lots of direction changes, appears to be hunting off Constellation Park.

8:11 a.m. - passing Constellation Park
again northbound.

8:00 a.m. - milling straight out from SW Caroll St at Beach Drive SW
.

7:35 a.m. - Single dolphin northbound off Me Kwa Mooks Park in West Seattle
. -Jason Lee Bell
