Entry 3:
Transient/Biggs killer whales - the T046Bs traveling with U39
(U designation means not enough information known about this whale - yet), amazing Dall's porpoise riding our bow, harbor porpoise doing tail-slaps, awesome Steller sea lions, harbor seals, bald eagles, and free ice cream! Can't get much better than that! Huge thanks to Capt Monte and Capt Eric for their diligence in finding so much wildlife today, it was an exceptional way to finish the season. (additonal notes: whales were north of Salmon Bank, towards Hein Bank, Dall's were more easterly as we were heading home, and porpoise were as we were crossing Rosario Strait. -Jill Hein, volunteer naturalist
*
T46Bs we saw them south of San Juan island on middle bank
. -Cassie Barclay

Entry 4:
Puget Sound - 1700
. Haven't surfaced for a few minutes after being super active. Last surface sequence had whales moving south. -Ariel Yseth
*
After a hard day at work, Tim picked me up at the fuel dock and we went out to find
2 humpback whales
that had been spotted near
Kingston
. We didn't find them, but I was watching an Orca Network post about
transients
that had turned South. We started heading that way and
spotted them near Picnic Point.
They took a sharp turn towards Possession (Point) so we hung back and watched them travel. They had split into two groups and suddenly they started porpoising towards our boat! We shut down and watched as the porpoise swam past with T87 right on it's tail. They finally all porpoised past us and then played with the Harbor Porpoise for at least 25 minutes! When they decided to eat the birds showed up, T087 swam a little ways away as the
T100B's
celebrated their kill! At one point it seemed like they may have had 2 porpoise, still not sure. We left them about an hour later as they turned South and last saw them
heading South past Apple Tree Cove
.

5:01 p.m. - T087 and T100B's made a kill off Possession
, harbor porpoise, possibly more than one as the kill took about 25 minutes before they ate! They are now headed South mid channel, kind of angling east a bit.

3:47 p.m. - they are headed SW off of Picnic Point T087 and T100Bs
. -Janine Harles
*

2:28 p.m. -
They are currently
between the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry lanes headed south
. -Melissa Simmons
*

1:51 p.m. - Possession Sound. North of the Mukilteo ferry
, SE of the Clinton ferry, and SW of Hat Island. There's a S-shaped current by the sailboats - they are just SW of it. Looking like more like 5-6 Orcas.

1:35 p.m. -
They're active, circling around and diving, near all the sailboats in
Possession Sound.
I'm seeing at least 3. Big, medium, small. -Jason R Bourne
*

12:45 p.m. - Orcas heading north between Mukilteo and Clinton
-- maybe heading into Saratoga Passage? At least 2-3 of them, one a big one with a distinctive grey patch behind the dorsal. -Lee Ann Tobin
*

12:30 p.m. -
Just saw
an adult orca and juvenile orca just south of the Clinton/Mukilteo ferry
near the Mukilteo side. -Dayasha Gunther

Entry 6:
11:10am ferry to Kingston (Two Spot),
Kingston side. Definitely the same as I saw the fluke. This evening we saw
a humpback in the same around around
6:20pm
, but can't confirm it was the same animal. -Kirsten Simonsen
*

7:55 p.m. -
Just heard
a whale just north of Apple Tree Cove
. Definitely will be looking first thing in the morning. -Darlene Moneypenny
*
Just after
6 pm
, at least of one of
humpbacks was definitely hanging around off the bluff in Kingston
, about a mile north of the ferry dock, vaguely traveling north. There were also 5-6 porpoises (or possibly dolphin?) in the same general area. -Kate Stovel
*
From Kingston ferry

5:45 probable HB
with 4-6 repeated blows. low or no surface activity looks like 2 small boats with it hopefully/maybe entanglement team with Juvie????
North of Kingston maybe near Apple Tree Pt.
Hard to gauge but close to kitsap shore. -Donna Green Van Renselaar
*

2:11 p.m. -
Fantastic viewing opportunity from
Presidential Point!
Been watching for a good 20 minutes! (Whale) was north just outside Apple Tree Cove till
2:25. Haven't seen since. -Chris Bennett

2:00 p.m. -
what a show this humpback just put on... breaching and tail slapping.
North of Kingston ferry terminal
.

12:19 p.m. - humpback north of Kingston ferry dock
heading north. Has not shown fluke yet. -Darlene Moneypenny

Noon - Humpback mid-channel off Apple Cove Point
. -Michael Gray
*

11:34 a.m. - Saw off Kingston
near mid channel marker (yellow, south of Kingston) about 20 minutes ago heading south. Haven't seen it again. -April Rebollo
*

10:30 a.m. -
It appears that
we had the HB that was reported as entangled down here off Kingston a few minutes ago. We lost it
though because we got distracted by two spot Bart Rulon Chilkat express. It appeared to be among toward Edmonds. Didn't see any net on it but it didn't come up very high at all. It breached when we first arrived but nobody got a good look when it did. Yes, it's a small whale with a pointy dorsal. Slash on left side. It isn't coming up very high. Humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot" - He was particularly photogenic...-Bart Rulon, Naturalist, Chilkat Express
*

11:05 a.m. - Two Spot
is the whale I see west of mid channel out from
Kingston dock
heading northbound. Confirmed by Bart.

10:25 a.m. - Humpback
continued south and is currently just north of
Presidents Point
. (mid way between Point Jefferson and Ferry dock) Sounded heading directionally North. He is close to Kitsap side. (This is
Two Spot
)

9:50 a.m - Humpback
is surfacing
north of Kingston Ferry dock
west side of channel heading south. (may have been entangled humpback based on sightings information from Bart Rulon, Chilkat - ALB) -Alisa Lemire Brooks, Orca Network
*

9:45-
9:50 a.m. - humpback is on Kingston side
close to ferry terminal. Taken from ferry (back of camera photo of breach splashdown not included, may have been the entangled humpback - ALB). -Donna Green Van Renselaar

Finally able to spot the
humpback
, heard him since 7am!! Just north of
Kingston ferry dock
and no real direction at this point. -Darlene Moneypenny

Entry 8:
Puget Sound
- The bonfire on Sunday evening was magical, with the
whale
clearly the guest of honor and blowing every thirty seconds, all evening long. Combined with the beautiful moonrise, it was ethereal. -Kathy Watson
