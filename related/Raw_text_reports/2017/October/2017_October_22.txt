Maybe it's the same crew, but they are feeding off
East Point- Fox Spit
, close to shore, and putting on quite the show, heading South now, very exciting to witness. We heard them breathing last night. -Susanne Schnippering

It's not too often we see whale watch boats (and whales) from home, but we lucked out today when the
T137As
made a foray into
Holmes Harbor
. We first spotted the whales
passing Hidden Beach, Greenbank
, watched vigilantly by a bald eagle perched on high, and caught up with them again later at Honeymoon Bay as they headed out towards Saratoga Passage. We enjoyed the bonus of warm, sunny weather accompanying the tranquility of nature in the wild, a far cry from the turbulence of the world and a gentle reminder of the true meaning of life.

4:45 p.m. - Orcas in Holmes Harbor
. Spotted three (maybe four) orcas including one small juvenile
heading out of Holmes Harbor
going north past Baby Island. Two impressive breaches by the biggest orca in the group. -Kat Johnson

3:00-
3:45 p.m. - They were in Holmes Harbor
, Freeland, Wa. We live at 1400 block Everette Ln, Freeland Wa. When we heard one of our neighbors say "orca", we grabbed the binoculars and headed down to our beach off the spit. There were
3 fins sighted
, but none large enough to be male. At least 1 was quite small. They appeared to be playing...lots of surfacing but no breaching. There were 2 boats, small whale watching as opposed to fishing/crabbing. They were following the Orcas. We were aware of them at about 3 and watched them until about
3:45pm. -Bruce and Beverly Hardcastle

2:17 p.m. -
They are in
Holmes Harbor
right now! almost to the golf course in the middle of the harbor along the wind/current line. Milling around, no direction. At least one juvenile. What a joy to live here! Made my day with
Orcas
in the harbor, along with Bald Eagles and Blue Heron and a backdrop of colorful fall trees. -Cindi Bowen

2:00 p.m. -
My husband and I were out on our stand up paddle boards near the boat ramp in
Holmes Harbor
. Around 2 PM we saw 2 Harbor seals, then 5 small porpoises (they were dark gray or black on top). My husband heard what sounded like gravel being dumped from a truck, only to look up and realize it was an
Orca
swimming. At this point I turned and saw
2-3 Orcas
. I saw their backs and dorsal fins then went down in the water and we didn't see them after that. The Orcas were on the right side of
Holmes Harbor
, if you are looking out at the water from Freeland Park. They were between the sailboats and the larger metal dock along on the right. -Tannis Rhoton

1:24 p.m. - One male, one female, and one juvenile are currently in Holmes Harbor.

Watching them from near
Polnell Point perhaps 4-5 miles from their location near Harrington Lagoon

They just passed us,
Harrington Lagoon Road
headed south.
2 males, 2 females, 1 juvenile

Entry 5:

Bottlenose dolphins -
(The reports, images, and video link below were all sent to Cascadia Research for species ID, here is Dave Anderson's reply: "Those look like bottlenose to me. I was wondering if there were multiple animals, and this confirms it." - ALB)

Entry 6:
2:09 p.m. - Two dolphins southbound Saratoga
, middle of the channel
between Strawberry Point and Camano
. I'm a captain on one of the blackfish boats and was not entirely sure of what type they were. I put a picture out on a naturalist page and they were certain that they were actually bottlenose. -David Scott
