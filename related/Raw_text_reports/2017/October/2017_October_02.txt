Orca Sightings for October 2, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
. There were no reports from Oct 5 to 7. Lifeforce Ocean Friends was not on the water at that time so our studies did not cover the Comox area. Today they were doing the same travel patterns. They were foraging and socializing. They did not seem to be in hurry to leave this area to head further south. -Peter Hamilton

Entry 2:
Sublime image of
Humpback CS631/CRC16017 "Two Spot"

off the Kingston ferry dock
in North Puget Sound. We love this whale! -Photo by Renee Beitzel,

We found
Two Spot
right after leaving the dock in Edmonds, he was across the way by the
Kingston ferry dock
. He was doing tail lobs and cartwheels, right side up and upside down, and he just kept doing them! The Kingston ferry even had to stop as Two Spot was tail lobbing in front of the dock! Lots of pics but so fun to watch!
After Two Spot we found T087 and the T100B's just North of Port Townsend!
