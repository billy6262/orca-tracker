Orca Sightings for October 15, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
We were with
J pod and L pod
with one of the first boats on seen and my wife got this picture. She thinks the larger orca is
J35 Tahlequah
with possibly a new baby. The larger whale logged on the surface for approx. 5 minutes and this is what brought the tiny fin to be seen. She was taking ID photos and saw it. Taken 10-15-2017 @ 1 pm -Brian Goldberg
ID notes from Dave Ellifrit, Center for Whale Research: "Hello, Thanks for sending the photos. After a close look at the pics, I believe the whales in them are
J17
(based on fin shape) and
J53
(based on size and fin shape). We did not photograph these two whales from our boat that day so it is great that you got photos. J53 does look very small sometimes (she fakes us out too) and Fall lighting can sometimes make whales look a little more orange than normal. But keep looking as this is the time of year when new calves could well show up! A new J pod calf would be very tiny, skinny,very orange, and probably glued to mom's side.One of these days we will get another one! Thanks again for the photos."

J pod and the L54s
came in today! (Id from Dave at CWR) Chum salmon are currently running. The whales did lots of foraging today, which is always awesome to see. They went
up the west side
, foraging as they went, milled and foraged
in the middle of Haro Strait
before coming back to the San Juan Island shoreline and then south. (for now) Will be curious to see if they stick around here, head back out to the Pacific, or head up north to the Fraser River. Beautiful day out there today! -Traci Walter

Last pass by at Lime Kiln was

4:15 with J 17s. J16's and possibly J26

humpback Two Spot (CS631) near Possession Point
. We hung out with the big guy for a bit while he explored the rip tide, then he saw a bird pile in the distance between Possession Point and Edmonds. We were shut down and ready with our cameras thinking he might lunge feed but surprise, he breached!! Then he tail lobbed and cartwheeled. -Janine Harles
