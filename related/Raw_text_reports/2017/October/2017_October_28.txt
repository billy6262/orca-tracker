Entry 2:
Humpback Whales (2) at
9:20 am in Georgia Strait. Had 2 Humpback Whales viewed off the BC Ferries they were travelling slow and fluking and feeding and heading towards Galiano.
Exact GPS coordinates 48.946705,-123.256295. -Melissa Hafting

Entry 3:
two humpbacks Heather (BCY0160) and Crater (BCXukKeta2014#1) heading South in San Juan Channel
towards the end of the island and heard one give a small trumpet
around
5:00 pm
. I wonder if they could hear that the other humpbacks were being harassed by orcas? Maybe they were coming to help. -Colleen Moore

Entry 4:
Anacortes now and spotted 2 humpback whales and at least 2 orca in the same area at
4:30.
(map shared indicate
south Hein Bank are
a). No direction, but the orca was clearly interacting with the humpbacks. As we left the
2 humpback and 2 orcas heading east, we spotted one more orca heading west in the direction of the humpbacks. The rolling around with their pectoral fins in the air sometimes, is correct. We thought possible feeding too, but the orca whales would periodically swim right to the humpbacks and then their would be huge splash. It looked like the orcas were attacking the humpbacks. The sound of the humpbacks are pretty remarkable (heard in the video). The humpbacks would sometimes just float it seemed for a while with their backs out of the water, staying stationary and then the orcas would periodically come up as if they were circling the humpbacks. We watched for an hour and it was the same thing the whole time. Humpbacks surfacing, staying pretty stationary with some rolling and showing pectoral fins, the two orcas coming out of the water periodically in what seemed like a circle around the humpbacks, and a rare (maybe 3 times in the hour we were there) the orcas swimming directly to the humpbacks with a lot of splash when they contacted. Pretty remarkable to watch. Thanks for all the work you do, Orca Network.
Narrative w/YouTube video:
Two humpbacks spotted around
4:30pm in what first appeared to be them feeding, but then spotted two orcas circling the humpbacks. Periodically, the two orcas would swim right to the humpbacks and then their would be huge splash. It looked like the orcas were attacking the humpbacks. The sound of the humpbacks trumpeting is pretty remarkable (heard in the video). The humpbacks would sometimes just float it seemed for a while with their backs out of the water, staying stationary while other times rolling and showing their pectoral fins. For the hour we were there, almost on repeat: Humpbacks surfacing, staying pretty stationary with some rolling and showing pectoral fins, the two orcas coming out of the water periodically in what seemed like a circle around the humpbacks, and a rare (maybe 3 times in the hour we were there) the orcas swimming directly to the humpbacks with a lot of splash when they contacted. Not sure if the orcas were attacking or just harassing the humpbacks. Pretty remarkable to watch. - Emma Hawkins

Sea Otter

Entry 6:
Noon - Off the southeast shore of Long Island , San Juans, south of Lopez Island
. I saw a sea otter resting in the kelp. Seen from a small boat. This is the first sea otter I've ever seen in these inland waters, and we go out in our boat every couple of weeks! 48.437629, -122.923075. -Photo by Jill Rain,
