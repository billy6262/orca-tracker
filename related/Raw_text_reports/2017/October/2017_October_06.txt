Orca Sightings for October 6, 2017
============================================================

Entry 1:
Haro Strait - ENTANGLED HUMPBACK.
Please keep an eye out for this entangled young humpback whale, photographed by Howard Garrett while out on the Mystic Sea in Haro Strait,
NW of Battleship rock
, heading south at around
1 pm
this afternoon. Given the type of entanglement and the weather and high seas, for now the Disentanglement team plans to try to monitor the whale until the weather clears.

Entry 2:
Single smallish mammal with curved dorsal heading south into Eld
being followed by a seal. It is approximately
8 feet long
. When I first saw the fin, I was in the house and looked over my shoulder just as it was slicing through the water...going down. I thought it was a sea lion flipper. Then I saw a seal's head and thought it might have been that. Then it surfaced again. I ran to the deck and was able to see it surface again right near shore, and the seal was sort of following it. It was heading south, and continued to go into Eld Inlet. I lost sight of it in the shadows of Cooper Point. It has quite a robust blow and surfaces quickly. -Kim Merriman

Saratoga Passage - Hi!
Lone orca
sighting yesterday,
October 6th @
9.59 am in my "backyard" directly between Camano Island & Baby Island
. She surfaced twice & headed north. Wish I had more pics - I saw her surface twice & a small splashy breach toward Baby Island. I live right above the most northern point of Camano State Park & it looked like she had been in the kelp bed directly below me & then headed a little toward Baby Island & then north in the Passage.

October 6 - On a chilly, damp morning, we left the marina with no word of cetaceans, and headed north through the San Juan Islands to stay in the calmer water. After enjoying the antics of some exotic deer and an eagle on Spieden Island, we moved northwest into Haro Strait, encountering choppy seas. Capt. Eric spotted
a tail lobbing juvenile humpback just west of Spieden, around Turn Point
. He/she tail lobbed at least ten times, then did a half breach pretty close to the boat. The whale then moved off and started doing long down times and barely breaking the surface when he/she exhaled. Upon examination of photos (please excuse the out-of-focus photo!), we saw
this young whale has a net or something else in it's mouth and down the sides
. Orca Network contacted NOAA, and hopefully they will be able to find him/her again and help get the gear off. We took a lovely tour of Flat Top and Jones Island, checking some harbor seals, then headed home. As our season ends, I am very grateful to the Mystic Sea team, our lovely passengers, and our beautiful wildlife we are so lucky to share a home with. -Bonnie Gretz, volunteer naturalist
